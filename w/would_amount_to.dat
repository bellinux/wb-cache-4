The judge sentenced Bell to 18 months in a juvenile facility on two counts of simple battery and two counts of criminal destruction of property, and Bell was taken into custody. According to Walters, the matter was unrelated to the assault on Barker, and {{it had not been}} referred to during the Barker proceedings. The defense filed a motion to dismiss the Barker charges on the ground that retrying Bell <b>would</b> <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> double jeopardy. On November 8, 2007, Mauffray denied the motion.|$|E
5|$|While Philip {{was walking}} through Abydos, he saw people killing {{themselves}} and their families by stabbing, burning, hanging, and jumping down wells and from rooftops. Philip was surprised to see this, and published a proclamation announcing that would give three day's grace to anybody wishing to commit suicide. The Abydenians, who were bent on following the orders of the original decree, thought that this <b>would</b> <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> treason to the people who had already died, and refused to live under these terms. Apart from those in chains or similar restraints, each family individually hurried to their deaths.|$|E

5|$|From 1808, {{a number}} of detractors argued that the {{navigation}} was in a poor condition, hoping to force Hollis to concede water rights to mills, and traffic declined. Another Act of 1811 allowed Hollis to raise the tolls, and eight years later, he held {{a meeting at the}} Winchester Guildhall, explaining why he needed to raise the tolls further. The meeting asked him to postpone his next Bill for a year, in return for which they would give him £1,200 for one year's tolls, wharfage and rent, he would spend £600 on repairs, and the remaining £600 <b>would</b> <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> 5 per cent interest on the estimated value of the navigation, which was then £12,000. He obtained his Act of Parliament a year later, which raised the tolls, but the Commissioners reduced freight charges at the same time, resulting in the operation being more profitable for Hollis and less so for the barge owners.|$|E
5|$|Strict Jains don't eat root {{vegetables}} such as potatoes, onions, roots and tubers. This is so because tiny life forms are injured when {{the plant is}} pulled up and because the bulb {{is seen as a}} living being, as it is able to sprout. Also, consumption of most {{root vegetables}} involves uprooting and killing the entire plant, in contrast to consumption of most other terrestrial vegetables, upon which the plant lives on after plucking the vegetables (or it was seasonally supposed to wither away anyway). Mushrooms, fungi and yeasts are forbidden because they are parasites, grow in non-hygienic environments, and may harbour other life forms. Alfalfa is the only known plant that contains vitamin D2, which they may use directly or make vitamin D2 supplements from. Honey is forbidden, as its collection <b>would</b> <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> violence against the bees.|$|E
5|$|The {{negotiations}} were inaugurated on 15 July 1963 at the Kremlin with Khrushchev in attendance. Khrushchev reiterated that the Anglo-American inspection plan <b>would</b> <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> espionage, effectively dismissing {{the possibility of}} a comprehensive ban. Following the script of his 3 July 1963 speech, Khrushchev did not demand a simultaneous moratorium on underground testing and instead proposed a non-aggression pact. Under instruction from Washington, Harriman replied that the US would explore {{the possibility of a}} non-aggression pact in good faith, but indicated that while a test ban could be quickly completed, a non-aggression pact would require lengthy discussions. Additionally, such a pact would complicate the issue of Western access to West Berlin. Harriman also took the opportunity to propose a non-proliferation agreement with would bar the transfer of nuclear weapons between countries. Khrushchev said that such an agreement should be considered in the future, but in the interim, a test ban would have the same effect on limiting proliferation.|$|E

5|$|When AirTrain JFK {{was being}} planned, it was {{expected}} that 11,000 passengers per day would pay to ride the system between the airport and either Howard Beach or Jamaica, while 23,000 more daily passengers would use the AirTrain to travel between terminals. This <b>would</b> <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> about 4 million paid passengers and 8.4 million in-airport passengers per year. The system would cause a reduction of approximately 75,000 vehicle miles driven per day, as well as accommodate over 3,000 daily riders from Manhattan, according to the FEIS. During the first month of service, an average of 15,000 daily passengers rode either the paid or unpaid sections of the system, less than the 34,000 expected daily riders. This made it the second-busiest airport transportation system in the United States, even though it had been open for only a month. Since then, ridership continued to rise. AirTrain JFK transported 1 million riders within its first six months.|$|E
5|$|The Jain {{concept of}} Ahimsa is characterised by several aspects. It {{does not make}} any {{exception}} for ritual sacrificers and professional warrior-hunters. Killing of animals for food is absolutely ruled out. Jains also make considerable efforts not to injure plants in everyday life as far as possible. Though they admit that plants must be destroyed {{for the sake of}} food, they accept such violence only inasmuch as it is indispensable for human survival, and there are special instructions for preventing unnecessary violence against plants. Jains {{go out of their way}} so as not to hurt even small insects and other minuscule animals. For example, Jains often do not go out at night, when they are more likely to step upon an insect. In their view, injury caused by carelessness is like injury caused by deliberate action. Eating honey is strictly outlawed, as it <b>would</b> <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> violence against the bees. Some Jains abstain from farming because it inevitably entails unintentional killing or injuring of many small animals, such as worms and insects, but agriculture is not forbidden in general and there are Jain farmers.|$|E
5|$|On 25 January 1989, the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1989 and the Internal Security (Amendment) Act 1989 {{were passed}} by Parliament {{to confirm the}} {{applicability}} of the subjective test laid down in Lee Mau Seng as the law governing judicial review of the executive's discretionary powers under the ISA. These Acts came into force on 27 and 30 January 1989 respectively. Speaking during the Second Reading of the constitutional amendment bill, Minister for Law S. Jayakumar said the Government was taking this step because it was of the view that the courts' application of an objective test <b>would</b> <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> judicial usurpation of the executive's functions in matters pertaining to national security, which the judiciary is ill-equipped to deal with. Its stance was that the objective test would empower the courts to substitute their views on the proper exercise of discretionary power conferred under the ISA for that of the executive in contravention of the separation of powers doctrine. Moreover, the judicial process, unlike executive decision-making, was not conducive to a swift response to national security threats. The courts, unlike the executive, lacked access to inadmissible evidence relevant to security matters, and judges did not possess the skill and knowledge of the security experts employed by the executive. Furthermore, the objective test did not find favour with the Government because it had been imported from the United Kingdom and other Commonwealth jurisdictions. Since the objective test had been formulated by foreign judges without consideration of Singapore's local conditions, the Government was averse to the idea of allowing the objective test to shape the development of Singapore law on matters of national security under the ISA.|$|E

5|$|The Right to Freedom of Religion, {{covered in}} Articles 25–28, {{provides}} religious freedom to all citizens and ensures a secular state in India. According to the Constitution, {{there is no}} official State religion, and the State is required to treat all religions impartially and neutrally. Article 25 guarantees all persons the freedom of conscience {{and the right to}} preach, practice and propagate any religion of their choice. This right is, however, subject to public order, morality and health, {{and the power of the}} State to take measures for social welfare and reform. The right to propagate, however, does not include the right to convert another individual, since it <b>would</b> <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> an infringement of the other's right to freedom of conscience. Article 26 guarantees all religious denominations and sects, subject to public order, morality and health, to manage their own affairs in matters of religion, set up institutions of their own for charitable or religious purposes, and own, acquire and manage property in accordance with law. These provisions do not derogate from the State's power to acquire property belonging to a religious denomination. The State is also empowered to regulate any economic, political or other secular activity associated with religious practice. Article 27 guarantees that no person can be compelled to pay taxes for the promotion of any particular religion or religious institution. Article 28 prohibits religious instruction in a wholly State-funded educational institution, and educational institutions receiving aid from the State cannot compel any of their members to receive religious instruction or attend religious worship without their (or their guardian's) consent.|$|E
5|$|While Noriega {{was out of}} the country, Díaz Herrera {{considered}} {{using the}} uproar around Spadafora to seize power, but despite mobilizing some troops, eventually decided against following through with the coup, realizing he could not count on sufficient support. Furthermore, Noriega had made a deal with his deputy, to the effect that he would step down as military leader in 1987 and allow Díaz Herrera to succeed him. In 1987, however, Noriega went back on this agreement, announced he would be heading the military for the next five years, and assigned Herrera to a diplomatic post. Díaz Herrera retaliated by making public statements accusing Noriega of rigging the 1984 election, murdering Spadafora, and of trafficking in drugs, as well as of assassinating Torrijo with a bomb on his plane. These statements provoked huge protests against Noriega, with 100,000 people, approximately 25% of the population of Panama City, marching in protest on June 26, 1987. Noriega charged Herrera with treason, and cracked down hard on the protesters. The U.S. Senate passed a resolution asking Noriega to step down until Herrera could be tried; in response Noriega sent government workers to protest outside the U.S. embassy, a protest which quickly turned into a riot. As a result, the U.S. suspended all military assistance to Panama, and the CIA stopped paying Noriega a salary. The Senate resolution had the effect of identifying the U.S. with the effort to remove Noriega; Noriega exploited the rising anti-American sentiment to strengthen his own position. Without the support of the U.S., Panama defaulted on its international debt, and that year the country's economy shrunk by 20%. However, though the U.S. considered not recognizing the new president, the state department decided not to do so, as that <b>would</b> <b>amount</b> <b>to</b> breaking relations with Noriega.|$|E
