60|$|The {{attentive}} {{reader of}} the lives of the Saints will find that this style of argument did in the past bring many tribes and nations into the Christian fold. It was second only to the claim of magic advantages, demonstrated by a free use of miracles. Only one great religious system, the Buddhist, seems to have resisted the temptation to secure for its divinity the honour and title of Creator. Modern religion is like Buddhism in that respect. It offers no theory whatever about the origin of the universe. It does not reach behind the appearances of space and time. It sees only a featureless presumption in that playing <b>with</b> <b>superlatives</b> which has entertained so many minds from Plotinus to the Hegelians with the delusion that such negative terms as the Absolute or the Unconditioned, can assert anything at all. At the back of all known things there is an impenetrable curtain; the ultimate of existence is a Veiled Being, which seems to know nothing of life or death or good or ill. Of that Being, whether it is simple or complex or divine, we know nothing; to us it is no more than the limit of understanding, the unknown beyond. It may be of practically limitless intricacy and possibility. The new religion does not pretend that the God of its life is that Being, or that he has any relation of control or association with that Being. It does not even assert that God knows all or much more than we do about that ultimate Being.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the syntax of partitive constructions <b>with</b> <b>superlatives</b> in French {{and the realization}} of gender in constructions with an animate noun, and focuses on contexts that allow gender mismatches ('la' 'plus intelligente de mes gentils professeurs' ‘the most intelligent of my kind professors’). We show that such mismatches are allowed in French superlative partitives that contain a default masculine noun. To account for the mismatches, we propose that the nouns involved have an unvalued gender feature that can be assigned a sex specification {{in the course of}} the derivation. For superlative partitives we propose that this specification takes place in a Gender Phrase in the outer DP. Furthermore, we show that quantified partitives (e. g. 'three of the books') behave differently from superlative partitives, a fact we try to explain in terms of ­structural differences. We distinguish between partitives with an 'of'-complement and ­non-canonical partitives with an ‘among’-PP or a preposed ‘of’'-'phrase. We also claim that our data can provide further insight into the role of locality in semantic agreement: we compare superlative partitives to quantified partitives in terms of agreement, and suggest that the two types of partitives should be placed in different positions on an Agreement Hierarchy...|$|E

40|$|Widely showered <b>with</b> <b>superlatives</b> when it {{was first}} {{published}} in 1996, and now commonly regarded as a masterpiece, Richard Hay's The Moral Vision of the New Testament (1996) constructs a pacifist reading of the New Testament. To date, Hay's reading has provoked no systematic refutation from proponents of the doctrine of just war. This essay hopes to offer such a refutation. Its argument has three main planks. First, that Hay's reading of the New Testament stories about god-fearing soldiers, who persist in their profession, is not compelling; second, that he fails to specify sufficiently the meaning of Jesus' teaching and conduct in terms of Jesus' own context (particularly the option of armed violence in the service of religiously inspired nationalism); and third, that Hay's normative moral concepts are often too crude, suffering from a failure to employ valid moral distinctions. The essay concludes by arguing that the doctrine of just war is better able than pacifism to make adequate sense of all the relevant New Testament data.

40|$|Od 1900. do 1945. napisani su brojni kritički tekstovi o regulatornom i arhitektonskom djelu Viktora Kovačića. Pridonijeli su profiliranju preciznijeg i drugačijeg razmišljanja o arhitekturi, koja je postala primarno umjetničko djelovanje. Kritički tekstovi postali su nezaobilazni dio definiranja kritičke misli u povijesti arhitekture u Hrvatskoj. S vremenom su izgubili karakter suvremene kritike, jer su postali integralni dio Kovačićeva arhitektonskog opusa. Za potpuno razumijevanje Kovačićeva djela i njegova vremena nužno je istovremeno proučavati arhitektonsko djelo i kritičke tekstove. A {{large number}} of {{critical}} reviews {{have been written about}} Viktor Kovačić’s town-planning and architectural oeuvre in the period from 1900 to 1945. All the critics have written about the regulation plan for Kaptol and its surrounding area, which had been awarded first prize at the public competition in 1908. The plan occupies a distinct place in Kovačić’s oeuvre in the town-building of Zagreb, as it well reflects the development and shifts in the critical reception of a new phenomenon such as town-building, which would after the Second World War become known as urban planning. A. G. Matoš, A. Jiroušek and Đ. Szabo have published three disparate critical interpretations of the regulation plans that entered the competition. Matoš’s critical method was based on a rather subjective selection and interpreta-tion of facts, as among all the contestants he only mentioned Kovačić and showered him <b>with</b> <b>superlatives.</b> The text brims with judgments based on current impressions, but lacks analysis and explanation. Matoš was staunch as an official hagiographer of Kovačić’s. Jiroušek’s text was written in a far more calm and dispassionate tone, giving contemporaries an overview of the competition jury’s criteria and a critical account of all the entries. He clearly observed that a change of generations had taken place and unambiguously promoted Kovačić as the leading figure of the mature and talented 2 nd academic generation of architects. Jiroušek’s attitude to Kovačić varied from moderate and measured criticism to the complete subjectivity of a panegyric. Szabo has demonstrated the most thorough understanding of the contemporary theory and practice of town-building. He clarified the difference between Kovačić and other contestants. On the one hand, there was the architect’s comprehensive study of the history and topography of the town area. In his regulation plan, Kovačić made an effort to synthetize the historical, topographical and proprietary features into a balanced artistic whole. On the other hand, there were the plans which completely ignored the actual features and entered regulation ideas that were financially untenable. V. Lunaček i K. Strajnić recognized the supreme artistic value of Kovačić’s and Ehrlich’s town-planning oeuvres, but failed to give detailed accounts. M. Krleža made an unexpected contribution when he wrote about the scandal that accompanied D. Ibler’s early career. In a single brilliant move he fully and irrefutably divested the venerated Kršnjavi of the little authority he had left. Using only his intuitive insight of a true literary talent, Krleža sketched the spirit of the culture of thetime and the significance of Kovačić’s regulation plan for Kaptol and its surrounding area. In the obituary for Kovačić, Lunaček concluded that he did not create novel forms of modern architecture, but rather that he had of-fered revitalized forms of revived Classicism, adjusted to the new age, new constructions and new materials. He instituted Kovačić as one of the leading representatives of the contemporary architecture and visual arts. The final assessment of his work was a positive one, but far removed from euphoria and triumphalism. According to the opinion of E. Schön, the regulation plan for Kaptol and its surrounding area was an irrefutable proof to the fact that Kovačić was capable of providing creative solutions to the most difficult and complex tasks in the art of building. Schön wavered between Lunaček’s and Matoš’s approach, even though he was often closer to the hagiographic approach. In his account of Kovačić’s life and work, Szabo had excellently clarified the theoretical principles of town-building in Kovačić’s regulation plan. He clearly pinpointed the causes of all the misunderstandings between Kovačić and the notable cultural figures in Zagreb. Kovačić’s works did from the start embody and exhibit a permanent value. The problem was that a fair portion of the dominant figures in the town’s artistic and cultural life lacked the capacity to observe this in the beginning. It is precisely the bitterness and ill-temperance of the disputes that best demonstrates just how far ahead of the leading representatives of his time Kovačić was. It was only after his death that the public came to realize the excellence and the timeless value of his work. Schön’s folio monograph from 1927 and Szabo’s major review from 1928 represent the apogee of a long process that was initiated by Lunaček, Matoš, Strajnić and Jiroušek. They were the ones who hallmarked Kovačić’s work as the unquestionable onset and a fundamental value of modern architecture in Croatia. Lj. Babić heralded the arrival of a generation of critics, artists and architects born in the 1890 ies, who did not outright appropriate neither the theoretical view, nor the artistic work of the older generation. Babić’s theoretical starting point was Krleža’s concise and concentrated assessment. For both of them, Kovačić was an eclectic with a refined taste and not a revolutionary creator of a new expression...|$|E
