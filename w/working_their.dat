5|$|A hazard {{of flight}} for very small insects such as thrips is the {{possibility}} of being trapped by water. Thrips have non-wetting bodies and have the ability to ascend a meniscus by arching their bodies and <b>working</b> <b>their</b> way head-first and upwards along the water surface in order to escape.|$|E
5|$|Because all {{the members}} were <b>working</b> <b>their</b> band {{schedule}} round their jobs they had to practice in basic recording rooms and write and record their own ideas. From this the members listened to each other's ideas and gave their interpretations and evaluations. Synthesiser player James felt the band produced their best work with this method as they were constantly assessing themselves.|$|E
5|$|The {{main body}} of Texian soldiers, under Collinsworth, became disoriented {{in the dark and}} wandered from the road. They were soon tangled in a {{mesquite}} thicket. While <b>working</b> <b>their</b> way back towards the road, the Texians met Ben Milam, a Texas colonist who had recently escaped from prison in Monterrey. Milam joined the militia as a private, and the group soon rejoined the vanguard.|$|E

5|$|Credited with 19 episodes, Steve Callaghan is {{the most}} {{prolific}} writer on Family Guy staff. Many of the writers that have left the show {{have gone on to}} create or produce other successful series. Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan co-wrote 13 episodes for the NBC sitcom Scrubs during their eight-year run on the show, while also serving as co-producers and <b>working</b> <b>their</b> way up to executive producers. Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman left the show and went on to create the long-running and still ongoing adult animated series American Dad! MacFarlane is also a co-creator of American Dad! On November 4, 2013, it was announced that Barker had departed American Dad! during its run as well, after 10 seasons of serving as producer and co-showrunner over the series.|$|E
5|$|Mike and Sulley are {{led away}} by the CDA, and are {{expelled}} from the university {{as a result of}} their actions, but the other members of Oozma Kappa are accepted into the scare program the next semester, as Hardscrabble was impressed by their performances in the scare games. As Mike leaves on the bus, Sulley runs after him to raise his spirits. Hardscrabble then appears and wishes the two luck, claiming they were the first students to have surprised her. The two take jobs in the mail room of Monsters, Inc., eventually <b>working</b> <b>their</b> way up to join the Scarer Team and setting the events of Monsters, Inc. in motion.|$|E
5|$|Scattered evidence, {{including}} the records in Irish annals {{and the images}} of warriors like those depicted on the Pictish stone slabs at Aberlemno, Forfarshire and Hilton of Cadboll in Easter Ross, suggest that in Northern Britain, as in Anglo-Saxon England, society was dominated by a military aristocracy, whose status was dependent in a large part on their ability and willingness to fight. Below {{the level of the}} aristocracy it is assumed that there were non-noble freemen, <b>working</b> <b>their</b> own small farms or holding lands as free tenants. There are no surviving law codes from Scotland in this period, but codes in Ireland and Wales indicate that freemen had the right to bear arms, represent themselves in law and to receive compensation for murdered kinsmen.|$|E

5|$|The 28th Brigade, 7th (Meerut) Division {{advanced}} from Beit Lid at 21:30 on {{an overnight}} march towards Masudiye Station and Sebustiye. They {{arrived at the}} 'Anebta road near Ramin at 01:30, and by 03:00 had advanced to capture the Masudiye Station along with an engine and 16 carriages, before continuing towards Sebustiye. During this march, a strong rearguard {{in the ruins of}} Samaria was attacked by the 51st and 53rd Sikhs. After <b>working</b> <b>their</b> way through an olive grove on the northwest side of the Central Powers' rearguard position, they attacked from the flank, with a platoon of 51st Sikhs gaining the crest from the southwest. The garrison of 181 German (or Ottoman) soldiers was captured with eight light and heavy machine guns. More than 400 sick were found in a hospital nearby.|$|E
5|$|Airfields, harbors and {{shipping}} {{were also the}} targets on October 12, this time in northern Formosa. These {{would be the first}} strikes Fighting 18 executed in the face of both significant anti-aircraft fire and airborne interception by enemy planes. The first fighter sweep of the day launched into overcast skies at 06:17 and headed for Shinchiku Airfield with VF-18 flying low cover. Unfortunately, the Japanese were alerted to the formation's presence ahead of time, and the morning's protective cloud cover dissipated above Shinchiku. Flak of all calibers was intense as a result. Harris and the other Intrepid fighters led the way in, pushing over in glide bombing attacks on hangars around the strip. After the bombs dropped, the fighters headed north for their next target, Matsuyama Airfield. On the way to Matsuyama the cloud cover thickened once more. Just shy of Taien Airfield, VF-18 pilots spotted six Japanese bombers <b>working</b> <b>their</b> way down through a layer of clouds, seemingly on a landing approach. Intrepids fighters caught and destroyed the whole bomber formation in two minutes. Harris was credited with shooting down two of them.|$|E
5|$|The recipes {{were often}} brief {{and did not}} give precise quantities. Cooking times and {{temperatures}} were seldom specified since accurate portable clocks were not available and since all cooking was done with fire. At best, cooking times could be specified as {{the time it took}} to say a certain number of prayers or how long it took to walk around a certain field. Professional cooks were taught their trade through apprenticeship and practical training, <b>working</b> <b>their</b> way up in the highly defined kitchen hierarchy. A medieval cook employed in a large household would most likely have been able to plan and produce a meal without the help of recipes or written instruction. Due to the generally good condition of surviving manuscripts it has been proposed by food historian Terence Scully that they were records of household practices intended for the wealthy and literate master of a household, such as the MÃ©nagier de Paris from the late 14th century. Over 70 collections of medieval recipes survive today, written in several major European languages.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, {{increasingly}} heavy {{passenger trains}} and {{a shortage of}} suitable motive power saw the C class used as mainline passenger locomotives, a somewhat unusual assignment for a 2-8-0. To facilitate passenger <b>working,</b> <b>their</b> maximum allowable speed was raised from 50mph (80km/h) to 60mph (96km/h) on the key North Eastern, Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong lines.|$|E
25|$|The Tigris Corps {{had taken}} the position, {{but the cost of}} {{breaking}} through the Ottoman defenses had heavy. Aylmer's command suffered 1,962 dead and 2,300 wounded out of 13,300 men. The medical preparations for the relief force had been almost an afterthought. Most of the medical units attached to the Meerut Division were still <b>working</b> <b>their</b> way upriver or awaiting transport in Basra.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{during the}} Revolution, {{settlers}} {{in search of}} good farmland began <b>working</b> <b>their</b> way up the Muscoot River from its confluence with the Croton River.

Good roads and the rivers of the time made it easy to ship their produce to the markets of New York City to the south.|$|E

25|$|An {{example of}} algal toxins <b>working</b> <b>their</b> way into humans {{is the case}} of {{shellfish}} poisoning. Biotoxins created during algal blooms are taken up by shellfish (mussels, oysters), leading to these human foods acquiring the toxicity and poisoning humans. Examples include paralytic, neurotoxic, and diarrhoetic shellfish poisoning. Other marine animals can be vectors for such toxins, {{as in the case of}} ciguatera, where it is typically a predator fish that accumulates the toxin and then poisons humans.|$|E
25|$|Australia won the toss and captain Ricky Ponting {{elected to}} bat first. They {{got off to}} a good start, with Gilchrist and Katich putting on 80 runs in only 14 overs before Gilchrist was bowled by Kallis. Katich and Ponting put on 48 in the next eight overs, and at 1 for 128 after 22.1 overs, Australia looked to be heading for a big score. But after that wickets fell regularly, with the spinners Muralitharan and Vettori <b>working</b> <b>their</b> way {{steadily}} through the middle order to restrict Australia to 8 for 255 {{at the end of their}} 50 overs.|$|E
25|$|Gender {{and racial}} issues are {{represented}} in Dreamgirls being a black-cast musical with three female lead roles. Being set in the 1960s, the Black Power Movement was influential on the story line with black artists starting {{to succeed in the}} music industry and black music becoming accessible to all audiences, which is a representation of racial boundaries being broken down. The story is based on three women <b>working</b> <b>their</b> way up in the music industry to achieve their dreams while the most powerful people in the industry are men. In the end, the women stand up for their rights and become influential figures.|$|E

25|$|Regular Show was {{inspired}} by The Simpsons and Beavis and Butt-Head, and Quintel credited the stylistic elements of Joe Murray's Rocko's Modern Life and Camp Lazlo as <b>working</b> <b>their</b> way into his style. Video games Street Fighter, Shadowrun and ToeJam & Earl â which Quintel played {{when he was a}} child â inspired the series, as did some British television programs. Quintel's interest in British television was influenced by his British roommate at CalArts, who introduced him to The League of Gentlemen, The IT Crowd, Little Britain, The Office and The Mighty Boosh; the latter was very influential to Quintel and would later influence the humor in Regular Show.|$|E
25|$|Parks' {{court case}} was being slowed down in appeals through the Alabama courts {{on their way}} to a Federal appeal and the process could have taken years. Holding {{together}} a boycott for that length of time would have been a great strain. In the end, black residents of Montgomery continued the boycott for 381 days. Dozens of public buses stood idle for months, severely damaging the bus transit company's finances, until the city repealed its law requiring segregation on public buses following the US Supreme Court ruling in Browder v. Gayle that it was unconstitutional. Parks was not included as a plaintiff in the Browder decision because the attorney Fred Gray concluded the courts would perceive they were attempting to circumvent her prosecution on her charges <b>working</b> <b>their</b> way through the Alabama state court system.|$|E
