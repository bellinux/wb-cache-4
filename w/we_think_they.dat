500|$|The New 52 ongoing {{series are}} {{organized}} under seven different [...] "families," [...] grouping similar characters or themes within the books together. By {{the release of}} the October 2013 solicitations, DC was no longer grouping the titles by these families. They instead began releasing one larger solicit, titled [...] "The New 52 Group". However, titles that were not participating in an event for the month, such as [...] "Forever Evil", were still grouped together in the larger solicit by the previous family headings. In September 2014, DC co-publisher Dan DiDio spoke about classifying the titles into the families, saying, [...] "one of the things we did, when we launched the New 52, we broke those classifications up {{in a way that we}} were able to draw attention to all the characters. So we put them in groupings so we would be able to promote and help them draw attention in groups. It was never made to be a certain amount different stuff. We always want to have different styles of product... with a lot of characters, we're careful. Things like Frankenstein and Grifter and Voodoo and things of that nature, which were really risky characters and risky chances for us to take, and we're very happy to do them. Even though they didn't work, we knew there was value in those characters... <b>We</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> brought a lot of value to the launch. They brought a lot of breadth and depth to the line of books, and a diversity to the line. We didn't want to put them out and then forget about them. It was very important to make sure that they were prominent in other series, and that's why we put them in" [...] other series.|$|E

I never used to believe that, but I do this time around. The way that Jessie and I {{like to think of}} it is that there's the curtain in the Queen Vic that separates the bar from their home – until you go behind it, you'd never have any idea there were problems. The bar is Kat and Alfie's public stage." [...] With the possibility that Alfie could be the father of Tommy, Richie added: [...] "As soon as I found out, I thought, 'If Alfie isn't infertile, then surely Tommy could be his son'. Jessie and I spoke about the dates of when Alfie was in prison, and when he saw Kat before she had the fling with Michael. The writers reckon they don't match up, but <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> do. Jessie is quite adamant about it!" ...|$|E

5000|$|Due {{to above}} {{mentioned}} facts it seems incorrect {{to agree with}} the statement of N.P. Gritsenko that [...] "residents of Kostek established trade relations with Kizlyar {{in the last quarter of}} the 18th century". <b>We</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> were established far earlier and in the 50s-60s they became constant.|$|R

Even when the world, in return for our making it our whole life, disappoints and defeats us with its prizes, we still {{question}} the truth of those who question the value of these prizes; <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> must be hopeless of them, or must be governed by some interest momentarily superior.|$|E

6000|$|We {{have just}} had our Prince and Pauper {{pictures}} taken; two groups [...] and some little single ones. The groups (the Interview and Lady [...] Jane Grey scene) were pretty good, the lady Jane scene was perfect, [...] just {{as pretty as}} it could be, the Interview was not so good; and [...] two of the little single pictures were very good indeed, but one [...] was very bad. Yet on the whole <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> were a success.|$|E
50|$|AIDS {{patients}} {{are less likely}} to receive the normal sympathy that sufferers of other diseases receive, and may even be regarded as sinners. Amr Salama said:For example, in Egypt <b>we</b> <b>think</b> it's a punishment from God and we should not treat it. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> that <b>they</b> get it from a sin so they deserve it, and <b>we</b> <b>think</b> it's very contagious so we don't deal with them in any way. So people die from that more than they die from anything else.|$|R

There is no {{weakness}} or {{exposure for}} which we cannot find consolation in the thought,--this {{is a part of}} my constitution, part of my relation and office to my fellow-creature. Has nature covenanted with me that I should never appear to disadvantage, never make a ridiculous figure? Let us be generous of our dignity as well as of our money. Greatness once and forever has done with opinion. We tell our charities, not because we wish to be praised for them, not because <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> have great merit, but for our justification. It is a capital blunder; as you discover, when another man recites his charities.|$|E

"Havin' fixed {{them off}} comfortably, we cut up the deer, and put {{all we could}} carry on our shoulders, for we knowed that if we left them we'd find nothin' but the bones when we came back. About an hour after this we came upon a deserted camp of Indians. It was so fresh that <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> must have passed but a few weeks ago. The whole camp was strewed with bones of deer, as if the red varmints had been havin' a feast. An' sure enough, a little farther on we came upon the dead {{carcasses}} of ninety-three deer! The rascals had taken nothin' but the tongues an' tit-bits, leavin' the rest for the wolves." ...|$|E

60|$|Buddhism, on the contrary, is the cri du coeur of pessimism. This life, it says, {{is but a}} {{chain of}} sorrows. To {{multiply}} days is only to multiply evil. These desires that urge us on are really cause of all our woe. <b>We</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> are ourselves. We are mistaken. They are all illusion, and we are victims of a mirage. This personality, this sense of self, is a cruel deception and a snare.

60|$|Brief and chance-taken {{as these}} letters are, <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> {{sufficiently}} prove {{the existence of}} the very qualities denied to Mr. Poe-humility, willingness to persevere, belief in another's friendship, and capability of cordial and grateful friendship! Such he assuredly was when sane. Such only he has invariably seemed to us, in all we have happened personally to know of him, through a friendship of five or six years. And so much easier is it to believe what we have seen and known, than what we hear of only, that we remember him but with admiration and respect; these descriptions of him, when morally insane, seeming to us like portraits, painted in sickness, of a man we have only known in health.|$|E
60|$|Let us {{consider}} {{the significance of}} Gandia's tied hands and the wounds upon his body {{in addition to the}} mortal gash across his throat. To what does this condition point? Surely not to a murder of expediency so much as to a fierce, lustful butchery of vengeance. Surely it suggests that Gandia may have been tortured before his throat was cut. Why else were his wrists pinioned? Had he been swiftly done to death {{there would have been no}} need for that. Had hired assassins done the work they would not have stayed to pinion him, nor do <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> would have troubled to fling him into the river; they would have slain and left him where he fell.|$|E

6000|$|It seems a {{shocking}} way to die; but I can say {{from experience that}} {{it is far more}} to hear of than to suffer. In whatever way so peaceful a life as his is ended, his end is peace.

[...] What his Mission will do without him, God only knows Who has taken him away. His ways are not as our ways. Seeing people taken away, when, as <b>we</b> <b>think,</b> <b>they</b> are almost necessary to do God's work on earth, makes one think that we often think and talk too much about Christian work. What God requires is Christian men. He does not need the work, only gives it to form or perfect the character of the men whom He sends to do it.|$|E

'Of his speculations as to {{what will}} befall this inestimable spirit when we appear to die,' Mrs. Shelley has written, 'a mystic ideality tinged these speculations in Shelley's mind; certain stanzas in the poem of The Sensitive Plant express, in some degree, the almost inexpressible idea, not that we die into another state, when this state is no longer, from some reason, {{unapparent}} as well as apparent, accordant with our being--but that those who rise above the ordinary nature of man, fade from before our imperfect organs; they remain in their [...] "love, beauty, and delight," [...] in a world congenial to them, and we, clogged by [...] "error, ignorance, and strife," [...] see them not till we are fitted by purification and improvement to their higher state.'

40|$|Abstract. We try to {{make some}} {{contributions}} in proving the conjecture which P. Borwein established. In that order, we consider it in the matrix form and notice some wonderful relations.
