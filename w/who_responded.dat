5|$|In 420 BC, {{he welcomed}} {{and set up}} an altar for the image of Asclepius at his house, when the deity was {{introduced}} to Athens.

5|$|When Dave Rosten, another Sydney evangelist, {{attempted}} to imitate Jenner's method of evangelism, he was {{punched in the}} midriff by the first person he spoke to, so he decided that Jenner's approach to evangelism was not for others to emulate. In 1947, Jenner asked his question to a man named Angus Carruthers, <b>who</b> <b>responded</b> {{that he was a}} Christian and going to heaven. Jenner invited Carruthers back to his home, where Carruthers met Jenner's daughter, Ann. Carruthers and Ann married three years later.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} {{his mission to}} Muhammad Ali, Montefiore was returning to Europe by way of Constantinople. On October 15, 1840, in the Ottoman capital he {{had a meeting with}} Lord Ponsonby, to whom Montefiore suggested that following the precedent set by Suleiman the Magnificent, the sultan should issue a decree (firman) formally denouncing the blood libel and effectively sealing the cases both in Rhodes and in Damascus. The British ambassador was enthusiastic about the idea, and within one week he arranged for Montefiore a meeting with Reshid Pasha. Montefiore prepared a draft text of the firman and had its French translation read to Reshid Pasha, <b>who</b> <b>responded</b> encouragingly.|$|E
5|$|At first, {{tenacious}} KPA defense {{halted the}} Marines <b>who</b> <b>responded</b> with artillery, raking Cloverleaf Hill. Heavy indirect fire forced the North Koreans {{out of their}} positions before the Marines and Task Force Hill eventually overwhelmed them, one hill at a time. The Marines approached Obong-ni first, destroying resistance on the slope with an airstrike and a barrage from US tanks, but strong resistance caused heavy casualties, {{and they had to}} withdraw. The 18th North Korean Regiment, in control of the hill, mounted a disastrous counterattack in hopes of pushing the Marines back. The division's tactics of cutting off supplies and relying on surprise, which had provided them so much success up to this point, failed in the face of massive US numerical superiority.|$|E

5|$|Black tells Bletcher about Richard Alan Hance (Jeremy Roberts), {{a serial}} killer Black had helped to {{apprehend}} twenty years before. Hance was a disturbed Vietnam War veteran who marked his kills with half a playing card, a custom he picked up during his tours of duty. Black {{was one of a}} number of Federal Bureau of Investigation agents <b>who</b> <b>responded</b> to an anonymous tip, leading them to Hance's location — however, the tip was called in by Hance himself and the raid became an ambush. Three agents were killed, and Black was cornered by Hance, who cut open his palm and nearly took Black's life before the young Black was able to overpower and arrest him.|$|E
5|$|Healthy {{to begin}} the 1975 season, Ellis {{continued}} to perform well {{at the beginning of}} the season. In August, the Pirates asked Ellis to pitch in the bullpen; he refused on consecutive nights. On August 15, 1975, Ellis refused assignment to the bullpen again; as a result, the Pirates suspended him for one day. Ellis called for a team meeting the next day, where he was expected to apologize. Instead, he berated Murtaugh, <b>who</b> <b>responded</b> by cursing at Ellis, ordering the pitcher out of the clubhouse and attempting to fight him. Coach Don Leppert reportedly also tried to fight Ellis. The Pirates suspended Ellis for thirty days and fined him $2,000. The suspension was lifted on August 30 when Ellis apologized to Murtaugh.|$|E
5|$|In 1054, {{relations}} between the Eastern and Western traditions within the Christian Church reached a terminal crisis, known as the East–West Schism. Although there was a formal declaration of institutional separation, on July 16, when three papal legates entered the Hagia Sophia during Divine Liturgy on a Saturday afternoon and placed a bull of excommunication on the altar, the so-called Great Schism was actually the culmination of centuries of gradual separation. Unfortunately the legates {{did not know that}} the Pope had died, an event that made the excommunication void and the excommunication only applied to the Patriarch <b>who</b> <b>responded</b> by excommunicating the legates.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, the Times Union of Albany {{received}} {{letters from}} readers requesting {{that all of}} NY149 be widened from two to four lanes. The letters were forwarded to NYSDOT, <b>who</b> <b>responded</b> that although the route was an important recreational route between New York and Vermont, the amount of traffic that the route carries was not high enough to warrant a four-lane divided highway. Additionally, the state {{would also have to}} take a significant number of properties along the roadway in order to widen it, which would affect the character of the area.|$|E
5|$|In 866, a major Arab raid along Dalmatia struck Budva and Kotor, {{and then}} laid siege to Dubrovnik in 867. The city appealed to Byzantine Emperor Basil the Macedonian, <b>who</b> <b>responded</b> by sending {{over one hundred}} ships. Finally, the 866–867 Saracens' siege of Dubrovnik, which lasted fifteen months, was raised due to the {{intervention}} of Basil I, who sent a fleet {{under the command of}} Niketas Oryphas in relief of the city. After this successful intervention, the Byzantine navy sailed along the coast collecting promises of loyalty to the empire from the Dalmatian cities. The damage done by Saracens is not known, but the fact that Dubrovnik managed to survive a fifteen-month-long siege, proves how well the city was fortified.|$|E
5|$|In {{the hours}} {{following}} the storm {{a state of}} emergency was declared in Halifax Regional Municipality and parts of neighbouring East Hants Municipal District and Colchester County. The Government of Nova Scotia requested that the federal government deploy 600 Canadian Forces personnel to assist local authorities in HRM with cleanup in the urban area and to assist utility crews with electrical power restoration. Many utility workers, especially those employed by Nova Scotia Power and the dozens of crews from Maritime Electric and NB Power <b>who</b> <b>responded</b> under mutual assistance agreements, worked for almost threeweeks without any considerable amount of rest. Many residents praised utility crews for their hard work in restoring the extensive damage.|$|E

The crew consisted almost entirely of Raimi and Campbell's friends and family. The make-up adviser for Within the Woods, Tom Sullivan, was brought on to compose the effects after expressing a positive reaction to working with Raimi.|$|E
5|$|Von Wallenrode {{called for}} new volunteers from France, England, and Scotland. Among those <b>who</b> <b>responded</b> was William Douglas of Nithsdale.

In Kaunas they organized a lavish feast, which was prominently featured in Konrad Wallenrod, an 1828 poem by Adam Mickiewicz. They devastated the nearby towns of Ukmergė and Maišiagala, but lacked the resources for a second siege on Vilnius. In November 1391 Vytautas attacked the areas near Merkinė and Hrodna, cutting off the easiest communication route between Jogaila and Skirgaila.|$|E
