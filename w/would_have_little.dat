5|$|Alexander {{was also}} noted for his {{nepotism}} that was partially {{due to his}} advanced age and belief that his family <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> time to profit from his reign. This was in contrast to his predecessor Innocent XI, who was known for being austere and had not caused any scandals through nepotism.|$|E
5|$|Neighborhoods in the {{vicinity}} of Eddy Creek include the Keystone Industrial Park, the Keystone Sanitary Landfill, and LaCapra Stone & Supply. It is estimated that there is one stormwater detention facility in the watershed. According to a 1992 report, development in an area near the creek <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> adverse impact on the creek.|$|E
5|$|Mallet {{traveled}} to Stockholm on 4 April {{where he met}} with Erik Boheman, the Swedish State Secretary for Foreign Affairs. During the meeting he presented the proposals for British reconnaissance flights and for the transport collaboration. The Swedish government rejected the former but accepted the latter. However, privately Boheman indicated that Sweden's air force would not pursue Allied planes in their airspace, and also that limitations of the transport collaboration meant it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> benefit for the British.|$|E

5000|$|Even though Metriorhynchus was an {{effective}} predator, it was vulnerable to predation from apex predators such as Liopleurodon which could grow to 6.39 meters (21 feet) in length. Since Metriorhynchus {{had lost its}} osteoderms, [...] "armour scutes", to become more efficient swimmers it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> defense against larger marine predators.|$|R
50|$|The {{trackage}} in Allegheny was not subsequently {{reported as}} part of the Allegheny and South Side, {{while at the same time}} the Oliver-founded and Western Railroad had both prior and since included trackage in the area; Given the Lower Works passing from Oliver Iron's hands in 1897 a switching line for the iron company <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> need for the trackage.|$|R
5|$|The New Zealand Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment {{found that}} the solar PV <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> impact on the country's {{greenhouse}} gas emissions. The country already generates 80 percent of its electricity from renewable resources (primarily hydroelectricity and geothermal) and national electricity usage peaks on winter evenings whereas solar generation peaks on summer afternoons, meaning a large uptake of solar PV would end up displacing other renewable generators before fossil-fueled power plants.|$|E
5|$|In fact, Puccini was {{at first}} less than {{enthusiastic}} about the idea for this comic opera– Florence as a setting did not appeal to him, and he feared the public <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> interest in the subject. However, he soon became interested, and did some work on the piece even while composing Suor Angelica. The religious-themed opera was completed in September 1917, and Puccini turned his full attention to Gianni Schicchi, although the war news and the 1918 influenza pandemic, in which Puccini lost a sister, distracted him from his work. The first draft was completed on 20 April 1918, and Puccini continued to refine and orchestrate it through the summer of 1918.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{strategic}} threat changed dramatically during the period that Zeus was being developed. Originally expected to face only a few dozen ICBMs, a nationwide defense was feasible, although expensive. In 1957, growing fears of a Soviet sneak attack led it to be repositioned {{as a way to}} protect Strategic Air Command's bomber bases, ensuring a retaliatory strike force would survive. But when the Soviets claimed to be building hundreds of missiles, the US faced the problem of building enough Zeus missiles to match them. The Air Force suggested they close this missile gap by building more ICBMs of their own instead. Adding to the debate, a number of technical problems emerged that suggested Zeus <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> capability against any sort of sophisticated attack.|$|E

50|$|As {{with all}} endoceratids Cameroceras was {{weighted}} {{so as to}} be horizontally stable. This <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been achieved by the endocones in the apical portion of the siphuncle that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> compensated for the visceral mass forward in the body chamber. The endocones <b>would</b> also <b>have</b> sealed off the more apical chambers from the siphuncle limiting changes in ballast to the more forward, centrally located, chambers. This result is that changes in buoyancy <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> effect on horizontal stability.|$|R
60|$|The case, however, was a {{promising}} one. Gabriel was not angry: {{he was simply}} neutral, although her first command had been so haughty. Such imperiousness <b>would</b> <b>have</b> damned a <b>little</b> less beauty; {{and on the other}} hand, such beauty <b>would</b> <b>have</b> redeemed a <b>little</b> less imperiousness.|$|R
5|$|The {{process of}} {{building}} skyscrapers became more sophisticated, starting with the acquisition {{of the real estate}} needed for the site. Brokers working on commission would secretly acquire the individual lots of land required for a project, operating under a variety of names to avoid having the price increase once a planned build became known. The properties {{at the front of the}} site would typically be bought first, so if news broke of the skyscraper then those owning property at the back of the plot <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> choice but to sell anyway. The funding for skyscraper developments was normally lent by banks, insurance companies, or raised through bonds sold through a specialised bond house, with the latter becoming increasingly popular after World War I.|$|E
5|$|Groucho Marx played Waldorf T. Beagle (later renamed Waldorf T. Flywheel), and Chico played Emmanuel Ravelli, {{the same}} name as the Italian {{character}} {{he played in the}} film Animal Crackers (1930). Mary McCoy played secretary Miss Dimple, and it is thought that Broderick Crawford also appeared as various characters. Groucho and Chico shared a weekly income of $6,500 for appearing in the show. During the Great Depression, this was considered a high sum for 30 minutes' work, especially since radio scripts required no memorization and only a few minutes were needed for costume, hair and makeup. By comparison, Greta Garbo's weekly salary from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer during the same period was also $6,500, though this was for a 40- or 50-hour week. Wynn was paid $5,000 a week for Fire Chief. In contrast, almost two-thirds of American families were living on fewer than $26 a week. In a classic Marxian twist, Harpo was paid a weekly salary for not appearing on the show, even though his mute character <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> to do in a radio program anyway.|$|E
5|$|He {{utilised}} unique tactical formations, {{which earned}} him comparisons to Martin O'Neill. He was particularly experimental {{with the front}} line, and was willing to use the loan market to bring in fresh talent. On 24 March, it was announced Gannon would leave Peterborough {{at the end of}} the season. Unable to avoid relegation despite a vast upturn in results, he announced that family commitments made him unwilling to stay for longer. Gannon had been satisfied with the board's contract offer, but his family still resided in Stockport. He was replaced by Gary Johnson on 6 April, following Gannon's own recommendation of Johnson. Though Gannon insisted that this was not ultimately his decision, but instead was down to the board. Striker Liam Dickinson was sad to seem him go, and told the media that Gannon <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> trouble finding a new management post.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his work}} on Paul, Paulus, he argued that without Paul, Christianity <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{basically}} become just another backwater Jewish sect that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> influence in later religious development. As a result, he concluded that Paul was [...] "the second founder of Christianity."He {{went so far as}} to separate Paul from his Jewish background, arguing that Paul was definitely influenced by certain Hellenistic concepts. As a result, his understanding of the flesh/spirit dualism within Paul parallels that of many others who understand flesh from a Hellenistic context where matter itself is inherently corrupted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so, sire," [...] replied Dalgarno. [...] "The {{sum total}} might indeed {{have been an}} object for {{consideration}} even to a Scottish king, at no very distant period; but it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> charms for me, save that I see here an entry which gives me the power of vengeance over the family of Glenvarloch; and learn from it that yonder pale bride, when she put the wedding-torch into my hand, gave me the power of burning her mother's house to ashes!" ...|$|R
5|$|In August 1793, Kościuszko, though {{worried that}} an {{uprising}} <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> chance against the three partitioning powers, returned to Leipzig, {{where he was}} met with demands to start planning one as soon as possible. In September he clandestinely crossed the Polish border to conduct personal observations and meet with sympathetic high-ranking officers in the residual Polish Army, including General Józef Wodzicki. The preparations went slowly, and he left for Italy, planning to return in February 1794. However, the situation in Poland was changing rapidly. The Russian and Prussian governments forced Poland to again disband most of her army, and the reduced units were to {{be incorporated into the}} Russian Army. In March, Tsarist agents discovered the revolutionaries in Warsaw and began arresting notable Polish politicians and military commanders. Kościuszko was forced to execute his plan earlier than he had intended and, on March 15, 1794, set off for Kraków.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Majority Leader Gary Hooser's {{statement that he}} intended to bring the bill to a vote before the full Senate, the Hawaii Family Forum stated other issues demanded more attention than civil unions and the bill would create legal challenges for child care and education. The group held demonstrations on Maui and Kauai and stated their intention to hold demonstrations to ask the governor to veto the legislation should the bill advance. Hooser argued for the bill using President Barack Obama's support of civil unions and the support of labor unions and the majority of Hawaii House representatives. The Honolulu Advertiser reported that Senate President Colleen Hanabusa privately told senators the bill could lead to a lawsuit to legalize same-sex marriage. The American Civil Liberties Union of Hawaii and Supreme Court of Hawaii judge Steven H. Levinson told the legislature that a lawsuit <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> chance of success.|$|E
5|$|In 1828, Ernest {{was staying}} with the King at Windsor Castle when severe {{disturbances}} broke out in Ireland among Catholics. The Duke was an ardent supporter of the Protestant cause in Ireland, and returned to Berlin in August, believing that the Government, led by the Duke of Wellington, would deal firmly with the Irish. In January 1829, the Wellington Government {{announced that it would}} introduce a Catholic emancipation bill to conciliate the Irish. Disregarding a request from Wellington that he remain abroad, Ernest returned to London, {{and was one of the}} leaders against the Catholic Relief Act 1829, influencing King George against the bill. Within days of his arrival, the King instructed the officers of his Household to vote against the Bill. Hearing of this, Wellington told the King that he must resign as Prime Minister unless the King could assure him of complete support. The King initially accepted Wellington's resignation, and Ernest attempted to put together a government united against Catholic emancipation. Though such a government would have considerable support in the House of Lords, it <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> support in the Commons, and Ernest abandoned his attempt. The King recalled Wellington. The bill passed the Lords and became law.|$|E

60|$|The Romans were {{somewhat}} the most numerous; but, had the cavalry opposed to them {{consisted of the}} Carthaginian horse, Malchus <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> doubt as to the result; he felt, however, by no means certain that the light armed Numidians were a match for the Roman cavalry. The party had stopped but {{a quarter of a}} mile from the spot where the rival bands met, and the crash of bodies driven violently against each other and the clash of steel on armour could be plainly heard.|$|R
25|$|The {{agreement}} struck {{between the}} government and Olympio was highly symbolic, given Olympio's long history of radical opposition to Gnassingbé Eyadema and his son, and it significantly bolstered Faure Gnassingbé's claim to be working for political reconciliation, openness, and cooperation. Nevertheless, some observers suggested that the agreement <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> practical effect, arguing that Olympio was largely distant from his party's operations.|$|E
25|$|There {{were other}} {{weaknesses}} in the plan, which were revealed as the campaign progressed. The Japanese assumed that the British {{would be unable to}} use tanks on the steep jungle-covered hills around Imphal. For ease of movement and supply, the Japanese left behind most of their field artillery, their chief anti-tank weapon. As a result, their troops <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> protection against tanks.|$|E
25|$|Although methane is a {{greenhouse}} gas on Earth, the small amounts {{that have been}} claimed to be present on Mars <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>little</b> effect on the Martian global climate.

50|$|Although General Herzog had, {{as best he}} could, placed contingents of {{the already}} partly demobilized army at {{the places where the}} French were {{crossing}} the border, these units probably <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> chance against the German pursuers of the French, led by the German General Edwin von Manteuffel. And there was theoretically a motive for such an attack: Prussia had waived its rights to Neuenburg in the Neuenburgerhandel in 1856/57 after mediation by the European powers. Neuenburg, which was where the Bourbaki troops entered Switzerland, had been a Prussian principality until 1857.|$|R
50|$|Carisbrooke Castle was {{originally}} a Roman fort. The castle {{is at the}} top of Castle Hill. It was built soon after William the Conqueror came to England. The William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford may have been responsible for its construction, but he was killed in battle during 1071 and so <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>little</b> opportunity to oversee the construction. Osbern's son, Roger, is more likely to have built or refortified the castle. It was at Carisbrooke Castle that William arrested his own half brother, Odo for acts of treason.|$|R
