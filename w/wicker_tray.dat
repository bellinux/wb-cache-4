60|$|The new-comers {{certainly}} looked {{somewhat like}} Charles Reade's picturesque pair, {{and every one}} watched them with idle interest as they drew nearer. A tall, robust girl of seventeen, with dark eyes and hair, a fine color on her brown cheek, and vigor in every movement, came up the rocky path from the beach with a basket of lobsters on one arm, of fish on the other, and a <b>wicker</b> <b>tray</b> of water-lilies on her head. The scarlet and silver of the fish contrasted prettily with the dark blue of her rough dress, and the pile of water flowers made a fitting crown for this bonny young fish-wife. A sturdy lad of twelve came lurching after her {{in a pair of}} very large rubber boots, with a dilapidated straw hat {{on the back of his}} head and a pail on either arm.|$|E
5000|$|To {{the usual}} {{cast of the}} Nativity of Jesus in art are added the earlier scene of the Annunciation to the Shepherds in the {{distance}} at the centre, five putti above, about to shower the scene with flowers, and a woman at left holding a large <b>wicker</b> <b>tray</b> with fruit. The scene {{takes place in a}} large but derelict classical building, to which a crude wooden lean-to stable has been added. The golden stone of the building is echoed by the tanned bodies of the shepherds, the cloudy sky, and other elements, giving an unusually unified [...] "coppery" [...] colour scheme to the painting, with the blue of the Virgin Mary's mantle and that of the woman carrying the fruit the other prominent colour. The ox, to the right of Joseph, almost disappears into the wall behind him.|$|E
