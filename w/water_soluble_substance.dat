About 40 % of newly discovered drugs are lipophilic and failed to reach market due to their poor water solubility. Solid dispersions proved to have tremendous potential for improving drug solubility. Orlistat is a poorly <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>substance</b> possessing anti-obesity property; {{in the present study}} an attempt was made to increase the solubility of orlistat by preparing solid dispersions using solvent evaporation technique. Three different formulations were prepared using Hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC), Polyethylene glycol (PEG) and Eudragit with varying ratios of drug and carrier viz. 1 : 1, 1 : 2, 1 : 3 and the corresponding physical mixtures were also prepared. These solid dispersions were evaluated for flowability, solubility characteristics and in-vitro drug release. The in-vitro release of the formulation OP-SD 3 was found to be best among all the 9 formulations with a release of 87. 2 % at the end of 2 hours. Release was best fitted with Korsmeyer-peppas kinetics and it shows that the drug release may follow diffusion mechanism. In-vitro dissolution studies showed that the dispersion system containing orlistat, dissolution of orlistat was retarded which attributed to ionic interaction and gel forming respectively but the solid dispersion containing PEG as carrier gave faster dissolution rate than physical mixture. Thus the solid dispersion technique found to be effective in increasing aqueous solubility of orlistat. </p...|$|E

A sharp decrease in percent metamorphosis was observed in larvae exposed to the muffled sediment condition compared to the sediment control.

Preparation of liquisolid systems (LSS) is a novel technique for improving solubility, dissolution and bioavailability of such drugs.

LSS exhibit advantages such as lower production costs compared to soft capsules; simple processing and providing enhanced drug release. The main benefit is higher bioavailability of the liquid drug, caused by a large surface area available for absorption.

30|$|With {{the small}} size of the embryo proper and the lack of an endosperm, it is logical to {{speculate}} that the varied forms of suspensors can play important roles in nutrient uptake. Histochemical staining of cell walls indirectly supports the notion that orchid suspensor can serve as a nutrient uptake site. The polychromatic stain toluidine blue O (TBO) can distinguish lignin, cellulose, and pectic substances on the basis of color differences (O’Brien et al. 1964; Feder and O’Brien 1968; O’Brien and McCully 1981). The fact that the suspensor cell wall stains pinkish-purple with no detectable lignin and cutin deposits, suggests that <b>water</b> and <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>substances</b> should be able to move apoplastically from the seed coat to the developing embryo proper via suspensor cells (Lee and Yeung 2010). The pinkish-purple color of the suspensor wall after TBO stain also suggests the presence of negatively charged groups which can increase cation-binding capacity of a wall (Smith 1972), and this can aid in solute uptake. A simple plasmolysis experiment indicates that the suspensor cell in the nun orchid has a more negative osmotic potential than the surrounding seed coat cells (Lee and Yeung 2010). The negative osmotic potential provides a driving force for water uptake by the suspensor. In order to visualize the uptake pathway, a fluorescent tracer 6 -carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFD) was applied to developing seeds. Once taken up by the cell, CFD would be hydrolyzed to carboxyfluorescein, giving a fluorescence signal within the cytoplasm. In this experiment, the fluorescence signal was first detected in the suspensor cell before appearing in the embryo proper (Lee and Yeung 2010). This work clearly demonstrates the pathway of solute movement and the importance of suspensor in embryo nutrition.|$|R

In this paper we investigate <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> humic-like <b>substances</b> in ambient urban aerosol using size exclusion chromatography-UV spectroscopy and laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. A careful method evaluation shows that both methods complement each other and that both are needed {{to learn more about the}} molecular weight distribution and the concentration of humic-like substances. An upper molecular weight limit of humic-like substances of about 700 Da and a concentration of 0. 2 ? 1. 8 µg/m 3 air can be estimated corresponding to 8 ? 33 % of the total organic carbon for an urban background site...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This study {{deals with}} the {{application}} of the filter paper method to determine water retention curves for mortar and concrete samples. A water retention curve exhibits the relationship between water content and energy state in interstitial water, normally expressed as a negative value when compare to normal conditions of temperature and pressure, being referred to as suction. Considering the water retention curve as a basic characterization tool for unsaturated soils, its usage in the engineering field concerning most of the construction materials remains as a pending task. However, stating that not only permeability, but also the water retention curve performs a significant role for <b>water</b> and <b>soluble</b> <b>substances</b> flow through a material's pores makes this observation essential for life-span estimation in cases like reinforced-concrete structures. This research paper offers results for water retention curves obtained in mortar and concrete samples. The experimental curves went through a fitting adjustment process using Van Genutchen's [1] model, showing consistency with the obtained results. Furthermore, the water/cement mix ratio does not indicate or suggest a direct influence for water retention curves...|$|R
40|$|Contaminated {{areas of}} a sewage-farm were {{identified}} by testing soil extracts {{with the aid of}} a biological test battery consisting of four single species tests (Ames-Assay, DMSO-, Collembola-, Cress-Test). Water extracts were used to examine the effects of <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>substances</b> whereas organic extracts of soils served in the test system to investigate the whole amount of extractable organic compounds including metabolites. To establish a quantitative relationship between extract and soil, soil equivalents were introduced. Soil equivalents are defined as the amount of extract equivalent to a defined amount of soil. By testing extracts from uncontaminated soils, in the Ames-Assay a 'no-effect'-range, the so-called window of competence, could be determined. Mutagenic effects of soil extracts with this window were evaluated as critical. For the three toxicity tests (DMSO, Collembola, Cress-test) measured effects beginning at 60 % level were deduced as superordinate mutual critical limit. This high level threshold value was chosen to ensure that only contaminated soils were identified which significantly differ from the background effects. On the basis of this evaluation concept measures regarding the use of the area are recommended if the critical effect limit is exceeded in one test system. In this context water and organic extracts are of the same value. Within the project this result was obtained for the plots RefB, nPAK, nPCB, GB, T 7, T 23, T 26, Acker, 510 b" 1, 510 b" 2, 510 c" 1, 512 c" 7, 701 a" 2, 701 c, 702 c" 5, 704 a" 5, 704 c" 5, 706 a" 7 and 706 b" 4. If three of the four test systems exceed the critical limit, limitations of soil use should be taken into consideration. This applied to the plots GB, T 23, 510 b" 1, 510 b" 2 and 704 a" 5. (orig.)

40|$|The {{group of}} {{patients}} suffering from the malignant brain tumour glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) have a median survival of only about one year. Thus, new treatment strategies are urgently needed. Gap junctions are intercellular channels, permitting intercellular transfer of <b>water</b> <b>soluble</b> <b>substances.</b> They are vital for cellular homesostasis, proliferation and differentiation. Gap junctions are composed of multimeric proteins termed connexins (Cxs), of which Cx 43 is the most ubiquitous. Cx 43 serves as a tumour suppressor independent {{of its ability to}} form gap junctions. Herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) mediated suicide gene therapy has shown promising results in preclinical research, but has as yet failed to prove clinical efficacy. Intriguingly, neural progenitor cells (NPCs) have shown tropism for intracranial tumours and could be exploited for improving the delivery of therapeutic genes or gene products. Epigenetic regulators, such as histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) and receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RTKIs), including gefitinib and vandetanib, have recently entered clinical trials. In the present study, primary cultures of GBM cells were established and showed positivity for neuroepithelial markers. Additionally, they were Cx 43 positive and functional gap junctions were demonstrated. The bystander effect in the HSV-tk/ganciclovir (HSV-tk/GCV) suicide gene therapy system was attenuated by a specific gap junction inhibitor, AGA, showing that this phenomenon is dependent on gap junction coupling in glioma cells. The HDAC inhibitor 4 -phenylbutyrate (4 -PB) up regulated Cx 43 and enhanced gap junction communication (GJC), a strategy which could have potential for improving efficacy of suicide gene therapy. NPCs exposed to 4 -PB also increased Cx 43 expression and gap junction formation. This, together with the propensity of NPCs of tracking down tumour cells, could add a new dimension to gene therapy. Cooperative antitumoural effects were evident in combination treatment of 4 -PB and the RTKIs gefitinib and vandetanib. These RTKIs showed an up regulating effect on the tumour suppressor Cx 43, which could show to be of importance in the downstream effects of RTKIs...|$|R
