5|$|Being {{a part of}} Best's family meant Mona was accorded respect on Merseyside, which {{included}} meeting well-known sports personalities {{of the time and}} receiving preferential treatment when booking a table in a restaurant, or a seat in the theatre. The Bests lived for a short time at the Best family's large home in West Derby, which was called Ellerslie, but Mona fell out with John Best's sister, Edna, who resented her brother's choice of wife. The family then moved to a small flat on Cases Street, Liverpool (above Ma Edgerton's public house) but Mona <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> for a large house—as she had been used to in India—instead of a smaller semi-detached house, which were prevalent in the area. After moving to a three-bedroom house in Princess Drive, Mona persuaded her parents, Thomas and Mary Shaw, to leave India and live with them in Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Earp was {{a lifelong}} gambler and <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> {{for a quick}} way to make money. After leaving Tombstone, Earp went to San Francisco, where he reunited with Josephine Earp. She became his common-law wife. They joined a gold rush to Eagle City, Idaho, where they owned mining {{interests}} and a saloon. They left there to race horses and open a saloon during a real estate boom in San Diego, California. Back in San Francisco, Wyatt raced horses again, but his reputation suffered irreparably when he refereed the Fitzsimmons–Sharkey boxing match and called a foul that led many to believe that he fixed the fight. They moved briefly to Yuma, Arizona, before joining the Nome Gold Rush in 1899. In partnership with Charlie Hoxie, they opened a two-story saloon called the Dexter and made an estimated $80,000 (about $2 million in 2017 dollars). Returning to the lower 48, they opened another saloon in Tonopah, Nevada, the site of a new gold find. Around 1911, Earp began working several mining claims in Vidal, California, retiring in the hot summers with Josephine to Los Angeles. Earp made friends among early Western actors in Hollywood and tried to get his story told. He was portrayed in film only once before he died, and very briefly, in the 1923 film Wild Bill Hickok.|$|E

Lasky. Dorothy Shaw was modeled after herself and Constance Talmadge, and Lorelei herself most closely resembled acquisitive Ziegfeld showgirl, Lillian Lorraine, who <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> for new places to display the diamonds bestowed by her suitors.|$|E

Harrold Carswell was unsuccessfully {{nominated}} by Richard Nixon in 1970, and {{was convicted in}} 1976 of battery for making an [...] "unnatural and lascivious" [...] advance to a male police officer working undercover in a Florida men's room. Some therefore claim him as the only gay or bisexual person nominated to the Court thus far. If so, {{it is unlikely that}} Nixon was aware of it; White House Counsel John Dean later wrote of Carswell that [...] "hile Richard Nixon <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> for historical firsts, nominating a homosexual to the high court would not have been on his list".|$|E
500|$|He was {{president}} of the British Chess Federation between 1970 and 1973, competed in the British Championship as late as 1978, and was still competing in club and county-level [...] tournaments and matches into his 80s. His obituary in The Independent recalled his [...] "savagely effective attacking style, honed to perfection through a series of 'serious friendly games' against his old rival Hugh Alexander". In 1972, George Koltanowski wrote that, [...] "his style was very pleasing to spectators because he <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> for dangerous continuations and quite often he found them!"

500|$|Former Scotland international, and McLean's {{teammate}} at St Mirren, Gary Teale has compared him to Barry Ferguson. Teale {{said that}} McLean had shown incredible maturity {{at such a}} young age and that from their first training session together he could see McLean's talent. McLean has an excellent first touch and is also very composed and assured on the ball. McLean also has very high energy, work rate and athleticism which enable him to make lots of attacking runs. McLean's manager at St Mirren, Danny Lennon, said that he thought McLean was an excellent passer and that he could [...] "open a tin of beans" [...] with his left foot and was also decent with his right. Lennon also said that McLean was a rare type of Scottish player because he <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> for a 'slide-rule' pass and he was actually capable of delivering them.|$|E
500|$|Douglas {{worked with}} a speech {{instructor}} on breath control {{in order to become}} better acclimatized to the fast rhythm of the film's dialogue. Early on in the shoot, Stone tested Douglas by enhancing his [...] "repressed anger", according to the actor. At one point, Stone came into Douglas' trailer and asked him if he was doing drugs because [...] "you look like you haven't acted before". This shocked Douglas, who did more research and worked on his lines again and again, pushing himself harder than he had before. All of this hard work culminated with the [...] "Greed is good" [...] speech. Stone planned to use a Fortune magazine cover in exchange for promotional advertisements, but Forbes magazine made a similar offer. Stone stuck with Fortune, which upset Forbes publisher Malcolm Forbes, who turned down a later request to use his private yacht. Stone switched from 12- to 14-hour shooting days {{in the last few weeks}} in order to finish principal photography before an impending Directors Guild of America strike and finished five days ahead of schedule. Sheen remembered that Stone <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> at the script and at his watch.|$|E
500|$|Spencer Stone {{was born}} in 1992 in Sacramento, California, United States to Brian Stone and Joyce Eskel. He has an older brother named Everett, a California Highway Patrolman in Redwood City, California, and younger sister named Kelly. Growing up in Carmichael, California, Stone met his now-best friends Alek Skarlatos and Anthony Sadler while {{attending}} Freedom Christian School in Fair Oaks, California, continuing their friendship into adulthood. All three men are described as sharing [...] "a deeply religious background and a belief in service to their community" [...] His mom stated {{that he wanted to}} become a soldier, watching countless Navy Seal videos with him. Stone later attended Del Campo High School where he played football, lacrosse, and other contact sports. Del Campo High School teacher and basketball coach Dave Nobis, remembers Stone as he played basketball in junior year through to senior year when he was also in Nobis' psychology class. Nobis said that Stone <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> out for family and friends, [...] ""His blue-collar attitude and how he cared about others, he would have been the one to step up rather than curl into a ball." [...] and that [...] "He was always trying to pick up his teammates, giving them a high five. After he graduated, he sent me a link to a motivational speech to use in my psychology class," ...|$|E

500|$|Best's {{family lived}} {{for a short time}} at the family home, [...] "Ellerslie" [...] in West Derby, until Best's mother fell out with her sister-in-law, Edna, who resented her brother's choice of wife. The family then moved to a small flat on Cases Street, Liverpool, but Mona Best <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> for a large house—as she had been used to in India—instead of a smaller semi-detached house, which were {{prevalent}} in the area. After moving to 17 Queenscourt Road in 1948, where the Bests lived for nine years, Rory Best saw a large Victorian house for sale at 8 Hayman's Green in 1957 and told Mona about it. The Best family claim that Mona then pawned all her jewellery and placed a bet on Never Say Die, a horse that was ridden by Lester Piggott in the 1954 Epsom Derby; it won at 33–1 and she used her winnings to buy the house in 1957. The house had previously been owned by the West Derby Conservative Club and was unlike many other family houses in Liverpool as the house (built around 1860) was set back from the road, had 15 bedrooms and an acre of land. All the rooms were painted dark green or brown and the garden was totally overgrown. Mona later opened The Casbah Coffee Club in its large cellar. The idea for the club first came from Best, as he asked his mother for somewhere his friends could meet and listen to the popular music of the day.|$|E
500|$|At the 1991 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Harries {{personally}} {{bought the}} television rights to An Evening with Gary Lineker, a comedy play written by Arthur Smith and Chris England based around {{a group of}} England fans at the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Smith bet Harries £100 {{that he would not}} be able to get the adaptation on television before the next World Cup. Harries tried selling Smith and England's screenplay to the BBC, Channel 4, LWT, Yorkshire Television and Central Independent Television to no avail. The BBC offered to produce it as a studio play but Harries wanted a full-length film to distinguish it from the original play, which was by then playing at London's West End. He was reluctant to offer the script to Granada because of his previous experience with the company. However, in 1992 he was accepted the position of controller of comedy at Granada and An Evening with Gary Lineker was made. Harries was disappointed that pressure from Granada's management had forced him to replace so many of the original stage cast; England was replaced by Paul Merton, leaving Caroline Quentin as the only original actor. The Edinburgh Fringe played an important role in Harries' early commissions at Granada; he was not fond of traditional styles of comedy and <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> for alternative comedians. These included Caroline Aherne, Steve Coogan and John Thomson (though Coogan [...] "got away" [...] from him after the BBC offered to produce his Alan Partridge shows). After the failure of Bhundu Beat, Harries commissioned Peter Morgan to write [...] "Mickey Love" [...] in 1993, one of a series of short comedy films for the Rik Mayall series Rik Mayall Presents.|$|E
500|$|Arranger Nelson Riddle found Sinatra to be a [...] "perfectionist {{who drove}} himself and {{everybody}} around him relentlessly", {{and stated that}} his collaborators approached him {{with a sense of}} uneasiness because of his unpredictable and often volatile temperament. [...] Granata comments that Sinatra was almost fanatically obsessed with perfection to the point that people began wondering if he was genuinely concerned about the music or showing off his power over others. On days when he felt that his voice was not right, he would know after only a few notes and would postpone the recording session until the following day, yet still pay his musicians. [...] After a period of performing, Sinatra tired of singing a certain set of songs and <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> for talented new songwriters and composers to work with. Once he found ones that he liked, he actively sought to work with them as often as he could, and made friends with many of them. He once told Sammy Cahn, who wrote songs for Anchor's Away, [...] "if you're not there Monday, I'm not there Monday". Over the years he recorded 87 of Cahn's songs, of which 24 were composed by Jule Styne, and 43 by Jimmy Van Heusen. The Cahn-Styne partnership lasted from 1942 until 1954, when Van Heusen succeeded him as Sinatra's main composer. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Sinatra insisted upon direct input regarding arrangements and tempos for his recordings. He would spend weeks thinking about the songs he wanted to record, and would keep an arranger in mind for each song. If it were a mellow love song, he would ask for Gordon Jenkins. If it were a [...] "rhythm" [...] number, he would think of Billy May, or perhaps Neil Hefti or some other favored arranger. Jenkins considered Sinatra's musical sense to be unerring. His changes to Riddle's charts would frustrate Riddle, yet he would usually concede that Sinatra's ideas were superior. Barbara Sinatra notes that Sinatra would almost always credit the songwriter {{at the end of each}} number, and would often make comments to the audience, such as [...] "Isn't that a pretty ballad" [...] or [...] "Don't you think that's the most marvelous love song", delivered with [...] "childlike delight". She states that after each show, Sinatra would be [...] "in a buoyant, electrically charged mood, a post-show high that would take him hours to come down from as he quietly relived every note of the performance he'd just given".|$|E

2500|$|During {{a celebration}} tribute to Altman {{a few months}} after his death, he was {{described}} as a [...] "passionate filmmaker" [...] and auteur who rejected convention, creating what director Alan Rudolph called an [...] "Altmanesque" [...] style of films. He preferred large casts of actors, natural overlapping conversations, and encouraged his actors to improvise and express their innate creativity, but without fear of failing. Lily Tomlin compared him to [...] "a great benign patriarch who <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> out for you as an actor," [...] adding that [...] "you're not afraid to take chances with him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Roundarm {{was said}} to have been devised in the 1790s by Tom Walker, known as Old Everlasting. Walker was a famous opening batsman who had a solid {{defensive}} technique and was notoriously difficult to dismiss. He was also a more than useful bowler who <b>was</b> <b>always</b> <b>looking</b> for ways to improvise. Legend has it that he and some of his fellow players in the [...] "Hambledon Era" [...] used to practise in a barn during the winters. Walker worked out that he could generate more bounce and variation of pace if he bowled with his arm away from his body and soon realised that these deliveries gave the batsman added problems. He tried to use the style in important matches but was no-balled and had to return to his usual underarm lobs, with which he was by no means unsuccessful.|$|E
