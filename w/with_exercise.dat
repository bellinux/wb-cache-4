40|$|In the master's thesis we {{researched}} {{the popularity of}} aerobic dance exercises compared to gymnastic exercises in {{the introductory part of}} physical education lesson by fifth-grader’s opinion. In the theoretical part we defined warming-up, which is a crucial part of every exercise. We described warming-up in the physical education lesson and we focused on warming-up <b>with</b> gymnastic <b>exercises.</b> Afterwards we consecrated on aerobic dance, described its characteristics and centered our attention on aerobic dance in school. We explained the influences of aerobic dance on motor abilities and described the procedure for planning lesson of aerobic dance. We also provided suggestions for the inclusion of aerobic dance into physical education lessons and into others spheres of school activities. In the empirical part, we obtained results from 24 pupils, which in the school year 2015 / 2016 attended 5 th grade in elementary school Osnovna šola Bičevje in Ljubljana. We wanted to find out, if pupils are more motivated during warming-up <b>with</b> gymnastic <b>exercises</b> or during warming-up <b>with</b> aerobic dance <b>exercises</b> and if pupils are more motivated after warming-up <b>with</b> gymnastic <b>exercises</b> or after warming-up <b>with</b> aerobic dance <b>exercises.</b> Also we wanted to find out, if the girls prefer warming-up <b>with</b> aerobic dance <b>exercises</b> more than boys, if the pupils, who don't like physical education, are more motivated for physical education after warming-up <b>with</b> aerobic dance <b>exercises</b> or after warming-up <b>with</b> gymnastic <b>exercises</b> and whether pupils, which don't attend none of sports interest activities, would be willing to attend the interest activity of aerobic dance. Results have shown, that pupils were not more motivated during nor after warming-up <b>with</b> aerobic dance <b>exercises,</b> but were more motivated during and after warming-up <b>with</b> gymnastic <b>exercises.</b> In the opposition to previous ascertainments pupils would rather warm-up <b>with</b> aerobic dance <b>exercises</b> than <b>with</b> gymnastic <b>exercises.</b> In addition, we found out, that girls would rather warm-up <b>with</b> dance aerobic <b>exercises</b> than boys. Results have also shown, that pupils who don't like physical education are more motivated for physical education after warming-up <b>with</b> gymnastic <b>exercises.</b> Last finding states, that those pupils, who don't attend any of sport interest activities, would be willing to attend the interest activity of aerobic dance. ...|$|R

CBT and related psychological and behavioural therapies {{have a small}} to moderate effect in reducing symptoms of fibromyalgia.

25|$|Heart failure (HF), often {{referred}} to as congestive heart failure (CHF), occurs when the heart is unable to pump sufficiently to maintain blood flow to meet the body's needs. Signs and symptoms commonly include shortness of breath, excessive tiredness, and leg swelling. The shortness of breath is usually worse <b>with</b> <b>exercise,</b> while lying down, and may wake the person at night. A limited ability to exercise is also a common feature. Chest pain, including angina, does not typically occur due to heart failure.|$|E
25|$|Treatment for {{idiopathic}} scoliosis {{also depends}} upon {{the severity of the}} curvature, the spine’s potential for further growth, and the risk that the curvature will progress. Mild scoliosis (less than 30 degrees deviation) may simply be monitored and treated <b>with</b> <b>exercise.</b> Moderately severe scoliosis (30–45 degrees) in a child who is still growing may require bracing. Severe curvatures that rapidly progresses may be treated surgically with spinal rod placement. Bracing may prevent a progressive curvature, but evidence for this is not very strong. In all cases, early intervention offers the best results.|$|E
