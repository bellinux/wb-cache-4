500|$|Simon Heffer, {{writing in}} the Daily Mail, said that Peel [...] "does not write with {{sufficient}} detachment" [...] or rigorously enough, but that the book will be {{of great interest to}} those <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> [...] "what is really wrong with the British Establishment"—Heffer {{made it clear that he}} felt Chenevix-Trench should never have been Headmaster of Eton in the first place, and that other people's appointments in the [...] "British Establishment" [...] were equally flawed. Paul Foot wrote a personal recollection for the Diary section of the London Review of Books, reprinted in the Guardian, in which he described the book as [...] "a wretched hagiography, full of clichés and bad jokes", and objected to its portrayal of Chenevix-Trench as [...] "a heroic figure".|$|E
500|$|Donning a {{disguise}} modeled after a raccoon, Cartman becomes a vigilante dubbed [...] "The Coon", who attempts {{to wipe out}} crime in South Park. Though Cartman tries to raise awareness about The Coon through word of mouth, nobody pays {{much attention to the}} Coon's efforts. When he reports [...] "crimes" [...] (such as mistaking a man innocently trying to kiss his date for a rapist) to the police department, he is threatened with jail time and snubbed off. During class, Cartman tries to hype up an appearance from the Coon, saying he will be on roof of a Walgreens later that evening. Cartman (as the Coon) shows up to the spot to find another child superhero named [...] "Mysterion", who is far more successful in garnering appreciation as a crime stopping icon from the police and South Park citizens <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> just [...] "Who is Mysterion?" [...] Cartman is angered by his lack of popularity and the attention Mysterion is receiving.|$|E
500|$|Under James Elverson, The Philadelphia Inquirer declared, [...] "the new Inquirer {{shall be}} {{in all respects}} a complete, enterprising, {{progressive}} newspaper, moved by all the wide-awake spirit {{of the time and}} behind in nothing of interest to people <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> what is going on every day and everywhere...steadily and vigorously Republican in its political policy, but just and fair in its treatment of all questions..." [...] During the 1900 Republican convention in Philadelphia, Elverson set up a large electric banner over Broad Street that declared [...] "Philadelphia Inquirer – Largest Republican Circulation in the World." [...] At the turn of the 20th century the newspaper began editorial campaigns to improve Philadelphia, including the paving of major streets and stopping a corrupt plan to buy the polluted Schuylkill Canal for drinking water. The newspaper continued similar politics under Elverson Jr., and by the 1920s The Inquirer became known as the [...] "Republican Bible of Pennsylvania".|$|E

2500|$|My {{answer to}} readers <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> whether I am [...] "really" [...] an insider or an {{outsider}} to the Pagan community is that I am neither and both [...] that how I {{look at things}} depends very much upon context, but contains both anthropological and Pagan perspectives at the same time. The ethnographic perspective is not about being an objective observer of a culture, but rather about containing within one body multiple, simultaneous frames of reference with which to interpret experience, {{and being able to}} shift easily from one to the other.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, Tottle {{published}} his controversial book as Fraud, Famine, and Fascism: the Ukrainian Genocide Myth from Hitler to Harvard, {{in which he}} asserts that claims the Holodomor was an intentional genocide are [...] "fraudulent", and [...] "a creation of Nazi propagandists". His book, published by Progress Publishers in Toronto, appeared {{around the same time}} Ukrainian Communist party leader Volodymyr Shcherbytsky publicly acknowledged the famine, in December 1987. As a result, the book was subsequently withdrawn from circulation. In a review of Tottle's book in the Ukrainian Canadian Magazine, published by the pro-Communist Association of United Ukrainian Canadians, Wilfred Szczesny wrote: [...] "Members of the general public <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about the famine, its extent and causes, and about the motives and techniques of those who would make this tragedy into something other than what it was will find Tottle's work invaluable" [...] (The Ukrainian Canadian, April 1988, p.24). Some of Tottle's material appeared in a 1988 article in the Village Voice, [...] "In Search of a Soviet Holocaust: A 55-Year-Old Famine Feeds the Right".|$|E
2500|$|In English many {{historical}} figures are still referred to {{with the family}} name first. This is especially the case in scholarly works about Japan. Many scholarly works use Japanese order with Japanese names in general, and a scholarly work {{is more likely to}} use Japanese order if the author is a Japanologist. John Power, author of [...] "Japanese names," [...] wrote [...] "People who can speak and read Japanese have a strong resistance to switching Japanese names to the Western order." [...] Books written by these authors often have notes stating that Japanese names are in the original order. Some books do not have consistent naming order practices. Shizuka Saeki of Look Japan said, [...] "This is not only a headache for writers and translators, it is also a source of confusion for readers." [...] Lynne E. Riggs of the Society of Writers, Editors and Translators (SWET), a professional writing organization headquartered in Tokyo, said, [...] "When you publish a book about Japan, you are publishing it for people <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about Japan. So they are interested in learning something new or something as it is supposed to be." ...|$|E

If I had time and ability, I think I should enjoy really going into philology. I get books sent me from people such as Max Muller, Grabalentz, &c.; and if I write to them at all, it is useless to write anything but an attempt at classification of the dialects; and that is difficult, for there are so many, and it takes so long to explain to another the grounds upon which I feel justified in connecting dialects and calling them cognate. It becomes an instinct almost, I suppose, {{with people in the}} trade.|$|E
6000|$|... § 21. How {{far this}} manly power itself acted merely in the {{accumulation}} of memories, remains, as I said, a question undetermined; but at all events, Turner's mind is not more, in my estimation, distinguished above others by its demonstrably arranging and ruling faculties, than by its demonstrably retentive and submissive faculties; and the longer I investigate it, the more this tenderness of perception and grasp of memory seem to me the root of its greatness. So that I am more and more convinced of what I had to state respecting the imagination, now many years ago, viz., that its true force lies in its marvellous insight and foresight--that it is, instead of a false and deceptive faculty, exactly the most accurate and truth-telling faculty which the human mind possesses; and all the more truth-telling, because, in its work, the vanity and individualism of the man himself are crushed, and he becomes a mere instrument or mirror, used by a higher power for the reflection to others of a truth which no effort of his could ever have ascertained; so that all mathematical, and arithmetical, and generally scientific truth, is, in comparison, truth of the husk and surface, hard and shallow; and only the imaginative truth is precious. Hence, whenever {{we want to know}} what are the chief facts of any case, it is better not to go to political economists, nor to mathematicians, but to the great poets; for I find they always see more of the matter than any one else: and in like manner those <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the real facts of the world's outside aspect, will find that they cannot trust maps, nor charts, nor any manner of mensuration; the most important facts being always quite immeasurable, and that (with only some occasional and trifling inconvenience, if they form too definite anticipations as to the position of a bridge here, or a road there) the Turnerian topography is the only one to be trusted.|$|E
6000|$|... "When we met, I said to him:--I have a last favour {{to ask of}} you. When we parted years ago, I {{had high}} hopes and brave resolutions--both are worn out. I then {{believed}} that I could not only rise superior to my misfortune, but could make that very misfortune the motive of my rise. You told me I was too quick of temper, too morbidly sensitive about the slightest reference to my father's death, too fierce and changeable under undeserved trial and disappointment. This might have been true then; but I am altered now: pride and ambition have been persecuted and starved out of me. An obscure, monotonous life, in which thought and spirit may be laid asleep, never to wake again, is the only life I care for. Help me to lead it. I ask you, first, as a beggar, to give me from your superfluity, apparel decent enough to bear the daylight. I ask you next, to help me to some occupation which will just give me my bread, my shelter, and my hour or two of solitude in the evening. You have plenty of influence to do this, and you know I am honest. You cannot choose me too humble and obscure an employment; let me descend low enough to be lost to sight beneath the world I have lived in; let me go among people <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that I work honestly for them, and want to know nothing more. Get me a mean hiding-place to conceal myself and my history in for ever, and then neither attempt to see me nor communicate with me again. If former friends chance to ask after me, tell them I am dead, or gone into another country. The wisest life is the life the animals lead: I want, like them, to serve my master for food, shelter, and liberty to lie asleep now {{and then in the}} sunshine, without being driven away as a pest or a trespasser. Do you believe in this resolution?--it is my last.|$|E
