25|$|The Capilla del Rosario or Rosary Chapel was {{constructed}} in 1763 and its vault is divided into four triangular segments. The north segment contains a naval battle where galleons, with Spanish and Ottoman coats of arms, fire at each other, referring to the Battle of Lepanto. The Virgin of the Rosary is credited with the Spanish victory. On the south side, there is a ceremony dedicated to the Virgin Mary in Rome, presided over by Pope Pius V. The main altar is gilded and contains {{the image of the}} Virgin. There are 15 small sections over mirrors with scenes related to the mysteries of the Rosary. On the east and west walls there are images of saints grouped by monastic order. In the interior of the chamber, there are portraits of Father Neri, Esteban Valerio de Alfaro and María Velázquez de Casillta (his parents). By the windows are portraits of Doctor Díaz de Gamarra and Dominican friar Francisco Alonso de Rivera and a self portrait of Pocasangre, <b>who</b> <b>emphasizes</b> his indigenous features. The roof of this inner chamber {{is in the form of}} a large shell. Writings such as the Ave Maria, prayers, saints' names and more are inscribed on the ribs of the shell.|$|E

In parallel, the remoteness of the Southern Dobrujan location and the clash of values have prompted Hoberman to compare the film with Fort Apache, a 1948 western by John Ford.|$|E

[...] Theme titles such as [...] "Tobacco kills, don't be duped" [...] (2000) and “Tobacco: deadly in any form or disguise” (2006) {{indicate}} a WHO belief that individuals may be misled or confused about {{the true nature of}} tobacco; the rationale for the 2000 and 2008 WNTD themes identify the marketing strategies and “illusions” created by the tobacco industry as a primary source of this confusion. [...] The WHO's WNTD materials present an alternate understanding of the “facts” as seen from a global public health perspective. [...] WNTD publicity materials provide an [...] "official" [...] interpretation of the most up-to-date tobacco-related research and statistics and provide a common ground from which to formulate anti-tobacco arguments around the world.|$|E
60|$|The class-war, like wars between nations, {{produces}} {{two opposing}} views, each equally true and equally untrue. The citizen {{of a nation}} at war, when he thinks of his own countrymen, thinks of them primarily as he has experienced them, in dealings with their friends, in their family relations, and so on. They seem {{to him on the}} whole kindly, decent folk. But a nation with which his country is at war views his compatriots through the medium of a quite different set of experiences: as they appear in the ferocity of battle, in the invasion and subjugation of a hostile territory, or in the chicanery of a juggling diplomacy. The men of whom these facts are true are the very same as the men whom their compatriots know as husbands or fathers or friends, but they are judged differently because they are judged on different data. And so it is with those who view the capitalist {{from the standpoint of the}} revolutionary wage-earner: they appear inconceivably cynical and misjudging to the capitalist, because the facts upon which their view is based are facts which he either does not know or habitually ignores. Yet the view from the outside is just as true as the view from the inside. Both are necessary to the complete truth; and the Socialist, <b>who</b> <b>emphasizes</b> the outside view, is not a cynic, but merely the friend of the wage-earners, maddened by the spectacle of the needless misery which capitalism inflicts upon them.|$|E
