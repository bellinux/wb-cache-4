6000|$|Now if {{all this}} can be done in the key of tragedy and philosophic comedy, it can, I have always contended, be done in the key of farcical comedy; and Overruled is a trifling {{experiment}} in that manner. Conventional farcical comedies are always finally tedious because the heart of them, the inevitable conjugal infidelity, is always evaded. Even its consequences are evaded. Mr. Granville Barker has pointed out rightly that if the third acts of our farcical comedies dared to describe the consequences that would follow from the first and second in real life, they would end as squalid tragedies; and in my opinion they would be greatly improved thereby even as entertainments; for I have never seen a three-act farcical comedy without being bored and tired by the third act, and observing {{that the rest of the}} audience were in the same condition, though they were not vigilantly introspective enough to find that out, and were apt to blame one another, especially the husbands and wives, for their crossness. But it is happily by no means true that conjugal infidelities always produce tragic consequences, or that they need produce even the unhappiness which they often do produce. Besides, the more momentous the consequences, the more interesting become the impulses and imaginations and reasonings, if any, of the people who disregard them. If I had an opportunity of conversing with the ghost of an executed murderer, I have no doubt he would begin to tell me eagerly about his trial, with the names of the distinguished ladies and gentlemen who honored him with their presence on that occasion, and then about his execution. All of which would bore me exceedingly. I should say, [...] "My dear sir: such manufactured ceremonies do not interest me in the least. I know how a man is tried, and how he is hanged. I should have had you killed in a much less disgusting, hypocritical, and unfriendly manner if the matter had been in my hands. What I want to know about is the murder. How did you feel when you committed it? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it?</b> What did you say to yourself about it? If, like most murderers, you had not been hanged, would you have committed other murders? Did you really dislike the victim, or did you want his money, or did you murder a person whom you did not dislike, and from whose death you had nothing to gain, merely for the sake of murdering? If so, can you describe the charm to me? Does it come upon you periodically; or is it chronic? Has curiosity anything to do with it?" [...] I would ply him with all manner of questions to find out what murder is really like; and I should not be satisfied until I had realized that I, too, might commit a murder, or else that there is some specific quality present in a murderer and lacking in me. And, if so, what that quality is.|$|E

40|$|A rather {{remarkable}} incident {{occurs at}} the end of 'The Disgraceful Scene ' ('Skandal'), the final chapter of 'An Unfortunate Gathering' ('Neumestnoe sobranie') - Book Two, Part One of The Brothers Kara-mazov (Bratja Karamazovy). Fedor Pavlovi ~ and his son Ivan are just about to depart from the monastery for the Karamazov house in town. Maksimov, an impoverished petty landowner from Tula is trying to mount Karamazov's carriage- Fedor Pavlovi 6 had invited him to come along. Suddenly, Ivan violently "punches Maksimov in his chest " and "sends him flying": "No Ivan Fedorovi 6, usev~ijsja u~,e na mesto, mol~a i izo vsej sily vdrug otpichnul v grud ' Maksimova, i tot otletel na sa 2 en'. Esli ne upal, to tol'ko slu 6 ajno. '' 1 The carriage starts off without Maksi-mov. Ivan's conduct surprises his father- someone so co~upt that it seems like nothing could surprise him: "Nu ~ego ~,e ty? Cego Ze ty? Za 6 em ty ego tak? " ("Why, what are you doing? What are you doing? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> to him?"). Scholars have pointed out the importance of Ivan's behavior for the course of the novel's narrative of double parri-cide. Victor Terras in his Karamazov Companion recommends paying special attention to Ivan's sudden violence: "The first 'dissonance ' in Ivan's behavior. It ought to be remembered". 2 Robert L. Jackson in The Art of Dostoevsky describes the finale of 'Skandal ' as the first instance of Ivan's translating his latent hatred for his father not into the silence of an "observer", but into violence...|$|E
