5|$|Riders protested {{during the}} ninth stage, a criterium in Milan. This protest was {{nominally}} about the overall safety {{conditions of the}} stage, and was sparked by life-threatening injuries sustained by Pedro Horrillo the day before.

5|$|Living in Denver, Yasui became {{involved}} with community relations, serving on committee {{set up by the}} mayor, and later from 1959 to 1983 on the Commission on Community Relations. This commission dealt <b>with</b> <b>race</b> relations and other social issues, with Yasui as executive director from 1967 to 1983. In 1954, he was chairman of the Japanese American Citizens League’s (JACL) district covering Colorado, Wyoming, Texas, Nebraska, New Mexico, and Montana. The Minoru Yasui Community Service Award was started in 1974 by Denver community leaders, and is awarded annually to Denver area volunteers.|$|E

5|$|The {{civil rights}} {{movement}} has influenced and informed the feminist movement and vice versa. Many Western feminists adapted the language and theories of black equality activism and drew parallels between women's rights {{and the rights of}} non-white people. Despite the connections between the women's and {{civil rights movement}}s, some tension arose during the late 1960s and early 1970s as non-white women argued that feminism was predominantly white and middle class, and did not understand and was not concerned <b>with</b> <b>race</b> issues. Similarly, some women argued that the civil rights movement had sexist elements and did not adequately address minority women's concerns. These criticisms created new feminist social theories about the intersections of racism, classism, and sexism, and new feminisms, such as black feminism and Chicana feminism.|$|E

Some scripts dealt <b>with</b> <b>race</b> and ethnicity with both Jeff and Timmy championing Hispanics, Native Americans, and Asian Americans. Aging Americans were presented {{in a positive light}} during the years when Andy Clyde was featured as Martin family friend/neighbor Cully Wilson.|$|E
5|$|A {{barrister}} {{and former}} amateur racing driver, Mosley was a founder and co-owner of March Engineering, a racing car constructor and Formula One racing team. He dealt with legal and commercial matters {{for the company}} between 1969 and 1977 and became its representative at the Formula One Constructors' Association (FOCA), the body that represents Formula One constructors. Together with Bernie Ecclestone, he represented FOCA at the FIA and in its dealings <b>with</b> <b>race</b> organisers. In 1978, Mosley became the official legal adviser to FOCA. In this role he and Marco Piccinini negotiated {{the first version of}} the Concorde Agreement, which settled a long-standing dispute between FOCA and the Fédération Internationale du Sport Automobile (FISA), a commission of the FIA and the then governing body of Formula One. Mosley was elected president of FISA in 1991 and became president of the FIA, FISA's parent body, in 1993.|$|E

5|$|In December 1979, Roberts {{made good}} on his threats when he, {{along with the other}} top world {{championship}} riders, released a letter to the press announcing their intention to break away from the FIM and create a rival race series called the World Series. When Roberts first arrived on the Grand Prix scene, motorcycle racers were competing for as little prize money as $200, at venues such as Imatra in Finland that featured railroad crossings and hay bales wrapped around telephone poles. In 1956, the reigning 500cc world champion, Geoff Duke and thirteen other riders were given six-month suspensions for merely threatening to strike. Roberts adopted a confrontational, sometimes belligerent stance <b>with</b> <b>race</b> promoters, challenging the previously accepted poor treatment that motorcycle racers of the day were accustomed to receiving. Although the competing series failed to take off due to difficulties in securing enough venues, it forced the FIM to take the riders' demands seriously and make changes regarding their safety. During the 1979 FIM Congress, new rules were passed increasing prize money substantially and in subsequent years, stricter safety regulations were imposed on race organizers.|$|E
5|$|The thirteenth stage saw {{the first}} stage that {{contained}} mountains from the Dolomites. On the penultimate climb of the day, the Passo di Eores, a lead group broke away that contained the likes of Andrew Hampsten, Piotr Urgrumov, and Massimiliano Lelli. The riders stayed out in front over the final climb of the Passi delle Erbe, but were eventually caught by the chase group containing the race leader Leoni. Moreno Argentin edged out Lelli for his second stage victory at the 1993 Giro d'Italia. The next day's route was even more demanding as it contained two ascents of the Passo Pordoi, {{as well as the}} climbing of three other highly categorized climbs. Miguel Indurain, Ugrumov, Claudio Chiappucci, and a few other general classification hopefuls were in the leading breakaway as they crossed the Pordoi for the second time. The group rode into the finish in Corvara <b>with</b> <b>race</b> leader Leoni trailing by several minutes. Chiappucci won the sprint to the line, while Indurain regained the overall lead.|$|E

The ASD sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with mental retardation and more than 5.5:1 without.
