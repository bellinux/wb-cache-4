5|$|Although he {{came from}} a privileged Anglo-Irish background, Synge's {{writings}} are mainly concerned with the world of the Roman Catholic peasants of rural Ireland and <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> saw as the essential paganism of their world view. Synge developed Hodgkin's disease, a metastatic cancer that was then untreatable. He died several weeks short of his 38th birthday as he was trying to complete his last play, Deirdre of the Sorrows.|$|E
5|$|Cicero {{decided to}} stay with his friend Titus Pomponius Atticus for a time, during which he perused Atticus's library, reading any and all books that dealt with {{overcoming}} grief. Unsatisfied <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> found, he relocated to his villa at Astura, where he composed the Consolatio. It was during this time that he also wrote the famed—and now lost—dialogue Hortensius. Cicero later opined that the Consolatio was written in an attempt not only to heal himself emotionally, but also to benefit others who are mourning or experiencing sadness.|$|E

5|$|From the Goebbels Diaries, {{researchers}} {{learned that}} Riefenstahl had been friendly with Joseph Goebbels {{and his wife}} Magda, attending the opera with them and going to his parties. Riefenstahl maintained that Goebbels was upset when she rejected his advances and was jealous of her influence on Hitler, seeing her as an internal threat. She therefore insisted his diary entries could not be trusted. By later accounts, Goebbels thought highly of Riefenstahl's filmmaking but was angered <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> saw as her overspending on the Nazi-provided filmmaking budgets.|$|E
5|$|Morchella rufobrunnea is the morel that is {{cultivated}} commercially per US patents 4594809 and 4757640. This {{process was}} developed in 1982 by Ronald Ower <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> thought was Morchella esculenta; M.rufobrunnea {{had not yet been}} described. The cultivation protocol consists of preparing a spawn culture that is mixed with nutrient-poor soil. This mixture is laid on nutrient-rich soil and kept sufficiently moist until fruiting. In the nutrient-poor substrate, the fungus forms sclerotia—hardened masses of mycelia that serve as food reserves. Under appropriate environmental conditions, these sclerotia grow into morels.|$|E
5|$|The best decade for January movies, Burr writes, {{may well}} have been the 1940s. It began <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{suggests}} was best January in cinema history. The Grapes of Wrath, His Girl Friday and The Shop Around the Corner, all considered classics, were released in January 1940. Later in the decade, other classic films would first reach screens during January, such as Sullivan's Travels, Shadow of a Doubt and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to England, Spurr {{worked as a}} journalist. In 1952 The London Daily Express sent him to Japan as its China and Far East correspondent, but he found that he had little time to resume his pursuit {{of information on the}} fate of Yamato. In the mid-1970s Spurr returned to the Far East again, this time as a writer for the Far Eastern Economic Review. He began conducting interviews about Yamato with former Japanese naval commanders and survivors of the battleship's last mission. He also gained access to Japanese naval documents and records seized by the United States, plus US interrogation transcripts. For the American side of the story, he interviewed US naval commanders and personnel involved in the sinking of Yamato. Satisfied <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> had, Spurr began writing the book in the late 1970s, over 30 years after he first found out about the battleship.|$|E
5|$|As Master of the Ordnance Warwick {{presided over}} an {{increasingly}} important government department, which centrally managed the storage and commissioning of the state's artillery, munitions, and small arms. Prince William of Orange valued English cannons, and Warwickwho fervently believed in the international Protestant causeseems willingly to have supplied him <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> wanted. The Spanish ambassador officially protested against this practice in 1576, since the weapons would have been used against Spanish rule in the Netherlands. In 1573 Warwick {{was admitted to the}} Privy Council. His attendance to business was quite regular until it declined sharply due to his deteriorating health in the 1580s. At the 1587 trial of Mary Stuart he acted as a commissioner and was asked by the Scottish Queen to plead for her with his brother, the absent Earl of Leicester. The day sentence was pronounced on her, Warwick did not attend.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in the 1950s, Béla H. Bánáthy, Chairman of the Leadership Training Committee of the Monterey Bay Area Council, {{formulated}} {{the idea}} of an experimental leadership training program. He named it White Stag Leadership Development after the white stag of Hungarian mythology, the emblem of the Fourth World Scout Jamboree, which Bela had attended when he was 14 years old. With the active interest and support of the Monterey Bay Area Council executive staff and board, Bela continually improved his experimental program. In 1963 Maury Tripp and Fran Peterson were working closely with Bela. They also served on the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America and brought the White Stag program to their attention. In November 1963, Dr. John W. Larson, a staff researcher for the National Council, observed the program's annual Indaba at the Presidio of Monterey. Impressed <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> witnessed, he recommended that the national office conduct a detailed analysis of the White Stag program.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{tendered}} {{his resignation}} from office on December 1, 1794, giving Washington two months' notice, {{in the wake of}} his wife Eliza's miscarriage while he was absent during his armed repression of the Whiskey Rebellion. Before leaving his post on January 31, 1795, Hamilton submitted a Report on a Plan for the Further Support of Public Credit to Congress to curb the debt problem. Hamilton grew dissatisfied <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> viewed as a lack of a comprehensive plan to fix the public debt. He wished to have new taxes passed with older ones made permanent and stated that any surplus from the excise tax on liquor would be pledged to lower public debt. His proposals were included into a bill by Congress within slightly over a month after his departure as treasury secretary. Some months later Hamilton resumed his law practice in New York to remain closer to his family.|$|E
5|$|He was disheartened <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> saw in Pernambuco, a {{province}} {{far away from}} the imperial capital, {{but one of the most}} important in the country. Local political bosses were aligned with the Party of Order or the Liberal Party, but these were mostly nominal affiliations. Local oligarchs had vied among themselves for centuries over power. To them, political principles, such as those preached by the national leaders of the Party of Order, meant little or nothing. Their political ambitions focused on patronage and the annihilation of their local rivals. Honório Hermeto found himself embroiled in an ongoing power struggle between the aristocratic planters, who sought to exercise control over provincial affairs.|$|E
5|$|In 1895, Edward Dean Adams, {{impressed}} <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{saw when}} he toured Tesla's lab, {{agreed to help}} found the Nikola Tesla Company, set up to fund, develop, and market a variety of previous Tesla patents and inventions {{as well as new}} ones. Alfred Brown signed on, bringing along patents developed under Peck and Brown. The board was filled out with William Birch Rankine and Charles F. Coaney. It found few investors; the mid-1890s was a tough time financially, and the wireless lighting and oscillators patents it was set up to market never panned out. The company would handle Tesla's patents for decades to come.|$|E

5|$|In April 1829, Nicolls was {{appointed}} Superintendent of Fernando Po (now Bioko), a tropical island immediately {{off the coast}} of Africa, which the West Africa Squadron used as a base for operations against the slave trade. Nicolls received the appointment after colonial administrator and anti-slave trade crusader William Fitzwilliam Owen had refused the post, and after merchant John Beecroft was deemed unfit for the post. Owen, however, voiced his dissatisfaction <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> viewed as Nicolls's harsh rule on the island, and Beecroft increased his influence in the area. Nicolls, in turn, attacked Beecroft for his dealings with former slavers. Nicolls's health suffered in Fernando Po and by April 1830 he had left for Ascension. When Nicolls returned to England ill, Beecroft was placed in temporary charge of the island.|$|E
5|$|In April 1942 Puttick was {{promoted}} to lieutenant general, the first New Zealand-born soldier to reach this rank. In the 1942 Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB). As the war progressed he was faced with the difficulty of juggling resources to maintain both the 2nd New Zealand Division in the Middle East and the 3rd New Zealand Division in the Pacific theatre. Later in the war, he was in favour keeping the 2nd Division in Italy to deal <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> {{considered to be the}} greater priority, the defeat of Germany, rather than have it be used against the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Krichell {{played a}} factor in signing future All-Star Tommy Byrne. He was {{referred}} {{by one of his}} scouts, Gene McCann, to see Byrne pitch for Wake Forest University. Impressed <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> saw, Krichell signed him for $10,000 ($ in 2010). He also signed Red Rolfe and Vic Raschi. Krichell oversaw the expansion of the New York Yankees scouting staff from two men to more than twenty part-time scouts by 1957. Among the scouts he hired for the Yankees were former players Babe Herman, Atley Donald, Jake Flowers and Johnny Neun. As he hired more scouts, Krichell reduced his own role, becoming the chief scout and regional scout for the New England area.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many other}} Latin American intellectuals, Vargas Llosa was {{initially}} {{a supporter of}} the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro. He studied Marxism in depth as a university student and was later persuaded by communist ideals after the success of the Cuban Revolution. Gradually, Vargas Llosa came to believe that socialism was incompatible <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> considered to be general liberties and freedoms. The official rupture between the writer and the policies of the Cuban government occurred with the so-called 'Padilla Affair', when the Castro regime imprisoned the poet Heberto Padilla for a month in 1971. Vargas Llosa, along with other intellectuals of the time, wrote to Castro protesting the Cuban political system and its imprisonment of the artist. Vargas Llosa has identified himself with liberalism rather than extreme left-wing political ideologies ever since. Since he relinquished his earlier leftism, he has opposed both left- and right-wing authoritarian regimes.|$|E
5|$|Obama, at age 38, was a {{lecturer}} at the University of Chicago and a two-term state Senator. Though friends, including Terry Link, his colleague in the Illinois Senate, warned Obama against challenging Rush, {{as there was}} no obvious reason to displace him to the voters, Obama ran anyway because of his frustration <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> claimed was Republican obstructionism in the Illinois Legislature and the feeling Rush was representing the district less well as he could. Also challenging Rush were Donne Trotter, a state senator, and George Roby, a police officer. Raymond Wardingly, a perennial candidate {{who worked as a}} clown, ran unopposed for the Republican nomination.|$|E
5|$|On 5 December 1942, Graf Zeppelin was towed back to Kiel {{and placed}} in a {{floating}} drydock. It seemed she might well see completion after all, but by late January 1943 Hitler had become so disenchanted with the Kriegsmarine, especially <b>with</b> <b>what</b> <b>he</b> perceived as the poor performance of its surface fleet, that he ordered all of its larger ships taken out of service and scrapped. Raeder was shortly relieved of command and replaced with the Commander of Submarines Karl Dönitz. Though Admiral Dönitz eventually persuaded Hitler to void most of the order, work on all new surface ships and even those nearing completion was halted, including Graf Zeppelin. On 30 January 1943, all major work on the ship ceased, though some limited, temporary work continued until March.|$|E
