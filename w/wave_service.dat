25|$|Prior to 1957, BBC radio covered {{every home}} Test match, with Arlott {{normally}} {{one of the}} commentators, {{but it did not}} broadcast uninterrupted ball-by-ball commentary. Test Match Special (TMS) was launched on 30 May 1957, providing a full ball-by-ball Test Match commentary service on the medium <b>wave</b> <b>service</b> of the BBC Third Programme. The first match covered was the first Test between England and the West Indies at Edgbaston. The TMS commentators that day were Arlott, Rex Alston and E. W. Swanton, with summaries provided by Ken Ablack, from the West Indies, together with Norman Yardley and Freddie Brown. When he retired in September 1980, he was the longest serving TMS commentator, equalled by Brian Johnston in 1993 and subsequently exceeded by Christopher Martin-Jenkins).|$|E

50|$|A wave {{provider}} {{operates a}} <b>wave</b> <b>service</b> {{on one or}} more networked servers. The central pieces of the <b>wave</b> <b>service</b> is the wave store, which stores wavelet operations, and the wave server, which resolves wavelet operations by operational transformation and writes and reads wavelet operations {{to and from the}} wave store. Typically, the <b>wave</b> <b>service</b> serves waves to users of the wave provider which connect to the <b>wave</b> <b>service</b> frontend. For the purpose of federation, the <b>wave</b> <b>service</b> shares waves with participants from other providers by communicating with these wave provider's servers. Copies of wavelets are distributed to all wave providers that have participants in a given wavelet. Copies of a wavelet at a particular provider can either be local or remote. We use the term to refer to these two types of wavelet copies (in both cases, we are referring to the wavelet copy, and not the wavelet). A wave view can contain both local and remote wavelet copies simultaneously.|$|E

50|$|<b>Wave</b> <b>services</b> use {{federation}} gateways and a federation proxy {{components to}} communicate and share waves with other wave providers. Federation gateways communicate local wavelet operations, push new local wavelet operations to the remote wave providers of any other participants, fulfill requests for old wavelet operations, and process wavelet operations submission requests. A Federation proxy communicates remote wavelet operations and is the component of a wave provider that communicates with the federation gateway of remote providers. It receives new wavelet operations pushed to it from other providers, requests old wavelet operations, and submits wavelet operations to other providers.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Over {{the past}} 25 years, {{networks}} have evolved from being relatively static with fairly homogeneous traffic to being more configurable {{and carrying a}} heterogeneous array of services. As the applications are ultimately the driver of network evolution, the paper begins with {{a brief history of}} circuit, packet, and <b>wave</b> <b>services,</b> along with the development of the corresponding transport layers. The discussion then moves to the evolution of network-node architecture, with an emphasis on the optical-electrical-optical and optical-bypass paradigms. Scalability and cost-effectiveness in meeting network demands are two key factors in the discussion. The evolution of networking equipment, along with the development of the optical control plane, has facilitated a configurable optical layer. The enabling technologies, along with their ramifications, are discussed. Finally, the paper speculates on how capacity might evolve in the future, to handle the undoubtedly new services that are on the horizon. Index Terms—Configurability, dynamic networks, network evolution, network services, network transport layers, optical bypass, optical network elements, optical networking. I...|$|R
