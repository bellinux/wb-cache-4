For the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist's finishing times on each stage, {{and the leader}} received a yellow jersey. This classification was considered {{the most important of}} the Tour de Suisse, and the winner of the classification was considered the winner of the race.

25|$|Points are scored {{based on}} the tricks won in the hand. There {{are several ways to}} count up the points for play, but they always add up to 250 points. The last trick <b>is</b> always <b>worth</b> an {{additional}} 10 points added to any existing points in the actual trick cards. The classic counting system of pinochle is where aces <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> 11, tens <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> 10, kings <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> four, queens <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> three, jacks <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> two, and nines <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> zero. This method takes longer to count the score {{at the end of each}} hand.

50|$|Grey nobles, {{typically}} martyrs {{that have}} public sympathy, <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> negative points so the player's {{goal is to}} avoid collecting them if possible.

Thus one guard <b>is</b> <b>worth</b> one point, two guards <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> four points, three guards <b>are</b> <b>worth</b> nine points and so forth.

5|$|A {{common theme}} in the fantasy genre is the battle between good and evil, which Martin rejects for not {{mirroring}} the real world.

Martin explores the questions of redemption and character change in the Ice and Fire series. The multiple viewpoint structure allows characters to be explored from many sides, such that the supposed villains can provide their viewpoint.|$|E
