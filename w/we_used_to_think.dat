40|$|In this paper, {{we define}} {{measures}} of urban diversity, density and segregation using new data and software systems based on GIS. These {{allow us to}} visualise {{the meaning of the}} multifunctional city. We begin with a discussion of how cities have become more segregated in their land uses and activities during the last 200 years and how the current focus is on reversing this trend through limiting urban sprawl and bringing new life back to the inner and central city. We define various indices which show how diversity and density manifest themselves spatially. We argue that multifunctionalism is a relative concept, dependent upon the spatial and temporal scale that <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about the mixing and concentration of urban land <b>uses.</b> <b>We</b> present three examples using spatially smoothed indicators of diversity: for a world city – London, for a highly controlled polycentric urban region – Randstad Holland, and for a much more diffusely populated semi-urban region – Venice-Padua-Teviso. We conclude by illustrating that urban diversity varies as people engage in different activities associated with different land uses throughout the day, as well as through the vertical, third dimension of the city.

40|$|Rather than a {{new feature}} of modern {{industrial}} society, we argue that the much-discussed problem of "risk " represents only a modern conceptual language for discussing the age-old problems of uncertainty and control. What is different about the worries of the present day is not the number of hazards we face or the degree of uncertainty we feel about our lives, but rather it is the language <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> and talk about them, a language that, in keeping with our time, is highly rationalistic. This rationalism is problematic because it can easily become rationalization. Risk explains uncertainty, and it also explains it away. It gives control and it takes control, and therefore we often feel trapped in an iron cage of risk. We critique that iron cage on several grounds. First, we offer {{a critique of the}} rationalization of risk assessment. Second, we critique the risk communication literature and its rationalizations. Third, we critique the recent emergence of risk as a significant theoretical category in environmental social science. Risk, we suggest in these critiques, has some strikingly undemocratic implications and we strongly urge greater caution in its use by social science and by our political systems...|$|R
5000|$|Wimsatt's {{philosophical}} position {{starts with}} two themes: we are limited beings {{and the world}} we try to understand is complex. [...] The problem then is {{how to build a}} philosophical world view based on these two themes. For Wimsatt, robustness (e.g., believing that a particular apple exists because we can see it, feel it, smell it, taste it, and hear it crunch when we eat it) is fundamental for accessing what exists in the world. The more we can detect things in multiple ways, the more we are inclined to believe they exist. Closely connected to robustness are the heuristics, which <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about the world and are foundational to his epistemology. They are rules of thumb, which can be wrong or biased but tend to work when applied to what is robust in the world. [...] For Wimsatt, questions of realism (i.e., what exists) are not separable from questions of epistemology (i.e., what we can know) and the discovery of what exists. This may appear circular, but it is by evolution that we have evolved multiple ways of detecting things in the world.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{address the}} long-standing puzzle of why some {{proteins}} find their targets faster than allowed by 3 D diffusion. To this end, we measured the one-dimensional diffusion of LacI repressor proteins along elongated Lambda DNA using single molecule imaging techniques. We find that (1) LacI diffuses along nonspecific sequences of DNA {{in the form}} of 1 D Brownian motion; (2) the observed 1 D diffusion coefficients DDNA vary over an unexpectedly large range, from 2. 3 × 10 − 12 cm 2 /s to 1. 3 × 10 − 9 cm 2 /s; (3) the lengths of DNA covered by these 1 D diffusions vary from 120 nm to 2920 nm; and (4) the mean values of DDNA and the diffusional lengths indeed predict a LacI target binding rate 90 times faster than the 3 D diffusion limit.

40|$|This study explores {{recurring}} metaphors {{in contemporary}} pop and rap lyrics. The first metaphor analyzed {{in this study}} is love is a fairy tale, in which women are portrayed either as helpless princesses who need to be saved or as deities who should not be compared to real women. The second metaphor discussed is that sex is violence. This metaphor is often expressed with violent verbs such as hit, break, and bang describing sex. The third metaphor is love is barter, which expresses the concept that women trade their bodies and sexual services for material objects such as a car or jewelry. All three metaphors tend to portray women in a negative light—either as helpless princesses, objects to be acted upon, or promiscuous vixens who are willing to have sex to get something they want. This study is based on the concept expressed by Lakoff and Johnson (1980) in Metaphors We Live By that the metaphors we express—either in speech or in song—represent the metaphors <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about different subjects (p. 6). Thus the three metaphors—love is a fairy tale, sex is violence, and love is barter—express the way that we think about women in our society. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{line with}} {{well-known}} trends in cultural theory (see Burke et al., 2000), Cognitive Linguistics has stressed {{the idea that}} we think about social reality in terms of models – ‘cultural models’ or ‘folk theories’: from Holland & Quinn (1987) over Lakoff (1996) and Palmer (1996) to Dirven et al.

40|$|It {{has long}} been widely agreed that some {{concepts}} can be possessed only {{by those who have}} undergone a certain type of phenomenal experience. Orthodoxy among contemporary philosophers of mind has it that these phenomenal concepts provide the key to understanding many disputes between physicalists and their opponents, and in particular offer an explanation of Mary’s predicament in the situation exploited by Frank Jackson’s knowledge argument. I reject the orthodox view; I deny that there are phenomenal concepts. My arguments exploit the sort of considerations that are typically <b>used</b> <b>to</b> motivate externalism about mental con-tent. Although physicalists often appeal to phenomenal concepts to defend their view against the knowledge argument, I argue that this is a mistake. The knowledge argument depends on phenomenal concepts; if there are no phenomenal concepts, then the knowledge argument fails. Anti-physicalist philosophers of mind since Descartes have sought to ground a metaphysical distinction between mind and body by appealing to epistemic facts. (Recent examples include the knowledge argument (Jackson 1982, 1986) and arguments which exploit the explanatory gap, including modal arguments based on conceivability or rational intuition (Bealer 1994, Chalmers 1996, Kripke 1972), or on semantic features associated with the necessary a posteriori (White 1986, 2006).)

40|$|Most of Canada’s publicly-funded {{educational}} institutions have operated since the 1990 s under blanket reprographic licences. But recent Copyright Act amendments and Supreme Court decisions in several copyright cases have added legislative and judicial {{weight to the}} idea that copyright encompasses both private owners’ rights and public users’ rights in the form of infringement exceptions such as fair dealing. Many {{educational institutions}} have responded to these changes by moving toward greater reliance on statutory users’ rights and direct licensing with copyright owners, and by moving away from blanket collective licensing. Not unexpectedly, copyright owners and the societies and collectives that represent them see the changes in copyright law in a different light. Copyright owners’ and educators’ variant conceptions of the kinds of educational copying that are compensable pose a challenging policy problem in need of a principled solution that upholds the legislative underpinnings of copyright law and is perceived to be fair. This article attempts to frame a balanced understanding of underlying issues by considering the nature and purpose of copyright, the purpose of copyright collectives, what is meant by fair dealing, and, ultimately, how we should think about copyright. It suggests that meaningful change may not be achievable without concerted attention paid <b>to</b> the language <b>we</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> and talk about copyright in order to construct a combat-free shared space in which learning, inquiry, and the production of creative works are fostered and, when appropriate, rewarded fairly...|$|R
