We wanted each and every person who played our game to have a unique experience, to have their own stories to tell. And we called it Thingy.|$|E
500|$|These {{lines have}} led to {{conflicting}} interpretations among Harrison biographers regarding a supposedly superior attitude on the singer's part. Ian Inglis writes of [...] "an increasingly familiar elitism in his apparent perception of himself", adding: [...] "When [...] sings of 'the pure of heart' and tells the Lord that 'there {{are just a few}} who bow before you,' the implied conclusion is that he counts himself among their number." [...] While acknowledging the ambiguity of this message, Leng writes: [...] "This could be taken as Harrison's statement of his own spiritual superiority, or it might be his metaphor for a rejection of conceit. If ego-driven politicians and self-serving military leaders were able to bow before anything, even a 'concept' like God, the <b>world</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> better place. 'The Day the World Gets 'Round' laments human nature and calls for a little humility." ...|$|E

500|$|Several {{publications}} {{praised the}} album's concept, and for being more humorous than the band's preceding albums. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic said: [...] "In {{an era when}} heavy rockers {{have no idea what}} happened in the '80s, much less the '30s, it's hard not to warm to this, even if his music isn't your own personal bag." [...] Barry McCallum of Independent Online called the album [...] "reckless and uninhibited—but it's not all that hard to imagine Manson letting go; he's had fun here." [...] Chronicles of Chaos also praised its concept, and {{went on to say that}} it might be one of the best albums in the band's discography, Alternative Press and Q each complimented the album's production, while Billboard highlighted the album's lyrical content and Manson's [...] "diatribes on religion, sex and prejudice." [...] Entertainment.ie called it an entertaining pop album, and summarized that [...] "the pop <b>world</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> much more boring place without —and that's what really counts." ...|$|E
500|$|Those {{who opposed}} this {{resolution}} argued that its presence {{would cause the}} other, more rational resolutions to lose support. Others argued that only the social, civil and religious rights of women should be addressed, not the political rights. James and Lucretia Mott were against the resolution; Lucretia said to Stanton, [...] "Why Lizzie, thee will make us ridiculous." [...] Stanton defended the concept of woman suffrage, saying women would {{then be able to}} affect future legislation and gain further rights. Frederick Douglass, the only African American at the meeting, stood and spoke eloquently in favor; he said that he could not accept the right to vote himself as a black man if woman could not also claim that right. Douglass projected that the <b>world</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> better place if women were involved in the political sphere. [...] "In this denial of the right to participate in government, not merely the degradation of woman and the perpetuation of a great injustice happens, but the maiming and repudiation of one-half of the moral and intellectual power of the government of the world." [...] Douglass's powerful words rang true with many in attendance, and the resolution passed by a large majority. Lucretia Mott spoke to end the session.|$|E
500|$|Written in 1986, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] was {{the first}} song lyricist Howard Ashman and {{composer}} Alan Menken wrote for The Little Mermaid, although Menken {{had not yet been}} enlisted as Ashman's composer when the song was first conceived. Directly inspired by Broadway's most successful musicals, Ashman believed that The Little Mermaids story would benefit from at least one song that serves as its heroine's [...] "inner diary of thoughts". Having always intended for Ariel to perform a song in her grotto, directors and screenwriters Ron Clements and John Musker originally asked Ashman to write a song in which Ariel declares her love for Prince Eric by singing to a statue of the character, but Ashman suggested that a song depicting the character's fascination with the human <b>world</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> stronger alternative. Ashman explained to the filmmakers that [...] "Part of Your World" [...] would be Ariel's [...] "I Want" [...] song, likening it to moments in stage musicals during which the heroine sings about her dreams so that the audience can begin to care about the character and her journey. Menken believes that Disney had not yet included explicit [...] "I Want" [...] songs in the studio's films prior to The Little Mermaid, making [...] "Part of Your World" [...] the first time one had been written intentionally for a Disney film. However, Disney princesses had technically been singing [...] "I Want" [...] songs since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) and Cinderella (1950). Observing structural similarities between the song and [...] "Somewhere That's Green" [...] from their musical Little Shop of Horrors (1982), the songwriters nicknamed [...] "Part of Your World" [...] "Somewhere That's Dry" [...] because they believe it resembles an [...] "underwater version" [...] of the Little Shop of Horrors song. Additionally, Ashman had written a song entitled [...] "Disneyland" [...] with composer Marvin Hamlisch for their Broadway musical Smile (1986) in which a young girl, much like Ariel, sings about regularly watching Disney anthology series as a means of escaping her troubled childhood. Menken identified the musical motif he composed for the beginning of the ballad as his favorite part of the song. Ashman debuted [...] "Part of Your World" [...] for Clements and Musker at his apartment in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. Only the directors' second time meeting Ashman and first time meeting Menken, Menken provided the piano accompaniment while Ashman sang Ariel's melody himself, instead of their traditional method of Menken singing lead vocals. Moved by Ashman's demonstration, Musker recalled that the lyricist gazed up towards the ceiling as though it were the human world itself as he [...] "became Ariel before our eyes" [...] and [...] "poured out his heart in song", helping them visualize [...] "this far-off place of wonder that so entranced this little mermaid.” ...|$|E

The Nakashima Foundation for Peace, currently housed in the Minguren Museum in New Hope, had its beginnings in 1984. [...] In 1984, George Nakashima had the opportunity to purchase the largest and finest walnut log he had ever seen and sought to use the immense planks to their fullest potential.

To do so the company has procured yet another extremely valuable walnut log that almost matches the size and magnificence of the original.|$|E
