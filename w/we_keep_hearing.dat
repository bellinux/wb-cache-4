Could it ever be that endless growth, market confidence or competitiveness are misguided aims for the world’s economies? In these reflections of mine, I wish to address one of these resilient beliefs. Specifically, in the traditional philosophical way initiated by Socrates, I shall assess some logical knots arising from a hypothesis, that is, the commonplace liberal notion that the so-called “free market ” possesses a unique capacity to generate prosperity...|$|E
