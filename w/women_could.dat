5|$|Although Athenian {{women were}} not legally {{permitted}} to dispose of large sums of money, they frequently had large dowries which supported them throughout their lives. Income from a dowry could be significant. The larger a woman's dowry relative to her husband's wealth, the more influence she was likely {{to have in the}} household since she retained the dowry if the couple divorced. Athenian <b>women</b> <b>could</b> also acquire property by inheritance if they were the closest surviving relative, but could not contractually acquire or dispose of property.|$|E
5|$|During this time, {{women were}} also given a more {{official}} standing. The Texas Legislature in 1911 {{refused to give}} A permission to hold a summer semester unless women were also permitted to attend. For the next several decades during the summers cadets {{were not required to}} be in uniform and <b>women</b> <b>could</b> attend class and participate in intramural activities.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Nancy Fink, a Brooklyn Law School professor, {{was elected}} as the congregation's first female president. Fink called a full {{membership}} meeting in 1982 {{to decide whether}} <b>women</b> <b>could</b> lead the services, blow the shofar (the rams-horn trumpet blown on the High Holidays), and whether daughters of kohanim (hereditary priests) could give the priestly blessing. Advised by Scheindlin, the congregation {{decided to make the}} services fully egalitarian, allowing women to perform all three functions.|$|E
50|$|As {{the class}} {{structure}} in America changed, so did measures of real wealth. Women in all social stations, even the working-class <b>woman,</b> <b>could</b> own {{a small piece}} of costume jewelry. The average town and country <b>woman</b> <b>could</b> acquire and wear a considerable amount of this mass-produced jewelry that was both affordable and stylish.|$|R

5|$|In 1994, Puerto Rican-American {{recording}} artist La India covered the song on her album, Dicen Que Soy which {{was produced by}} Sergio George and released as the album's first single. It was picked by George for India to cover as {{he felt it was}} something <b>women</b> <b>could</b> relate to. India's version was included on the soundtrack for The 24 Hour Woman.|$|E
5|$|Thiruvilaiyadal was {{released}} on 31 July 1965. During the screening in a Madras cinema house several women went into a religious frenzy during a sequence with Avvaiyar and Murugan. This led to the projection being temporarily suspended so that the <b>women</b> <b>could</b> be attended to. According to artist V. Jeevananthan, {{the management of the}} Raja Theatre erected a set of Mount Kailash to promote the film.|$|E
5|$|Wollstonecraft's feminist critics {{charged that}} the {{masculine}} role for women that she envisioned—one designed for the public sphere but which <b>women</b> <b>could</b> not perform in the public sphere—left women without a specific social position. They saw it as ultimately confining and limiting—as offering women more {{in the way of}} education without a real way to use it.|$|E

5|$|A recent phenomenon, the {{migration}} of rural Chinese workers began in 1984 when the Regulations of Permanent Residence Registration became less punitive and allowed people to move to find employment. People left rural areas to escape poverty, and females left {{due to the lack}} of local opportunities for women. In the cities, <b>women</b> <b>could</b> find new, low-paid factory-based jobs that did not require highly skilled workers. According to national statistics, the ratio of male to female migrant workers averages 2:1, and an estimated 30-40 million of the migrant women work in the cities, namely Hong Kong and Shenzhen.|$|E
5|$|Academics have {{researched}} its use {{for treatment}} of female sexual arousal disorder and chronic anorgasmiaa sexual dysfunction {{in which a person}} cannot achieve orgasm. The Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology published a 1979 study which found self-administered treatment and use of the Magic Wand to be the best method to achieve orgasm. In 2008, The Scientific World Journal published research finding over 93% of a group of 500 chronic anorgasmic <b>women</b> <b>could</b> reach orgasm using the Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method. The device was used in studies in many applications, including articles published in Dermatology Online Journal, Journal of Applied Physiology, Experimental Brain Research, Neuroscience Letters, and Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing.|$|E
5|$|Along with Annie Smith Peck, Workman was {{recognized}} {{during the early}} 20th century {{as one of the}} most famous female climbers in the world. Their rivalry demonstrated that <b>women</b> <b>could</b> climb the most remote and difficult terrain on the planet. Women had climbed regularly in the Alps since the 1850s, but in the Himalayas, mountaineering had been dominated by wealthy English men. No other women, however, climbed in the Himalaya until well after World War I, by which time improvements in equipment and organization had shifted that nature of risks and difficulties of expeditions.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the authors}} of Islamic Homosexualities argued this did not mean <b>women</b> <b>could</b> not engage in lesbian relationships, a lesbian {{anthropologist}} in 1991 visited Yemen and reported that women in the town she visited were unable to comprehend her romantic relationship to another woman. Women in Pakistan are expected to marry men; {{those who do not}} are ostracized. Women, however, may have intimate relations with other women as long as their wifely duties are met, their private matters are kept quiet, and the woman with whom they are involved is somehow related by family or logical interest to her lover.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} legal status as {{citizens}} {{and the degree to}} which they could become emancipated, <b>women</b> <b>could</b> own property, enter contracts, and engage in business, including shipping, manufacturing, and lending money. Inscriptions throughout the Empire honour women as benefactors in funding public works, an indication they could acquire and dispose of considerable fortunes; for instance, the Arch of the Sergii was funded by Salvia Postuma, a female member of the family honoured, and the largest building in the forum at Pompeii was funded by Eumachia, a priestess of Venus.|$|E
5|$|Democrats {{remained}} in the minority when the 43rd Congress convened in 1873. Randall continued his opposition to measures proposed by Republicans, especially those intended to increase {{the power of the}} federal government. That term saw the introduction of a new civil rights bill with farther-reaching ambitions than any before it. Previous acts had seen the use of federal courts and troops to guarantee that black men and <b>women</b> <b>could</b> not be deprived of their civil rights by any state. Now Senator Charles Sumner of Massachusetts proposed a new bill, aimed at requiring equal rights in all public accommodations. When Sumner died in 1874, his bill had not passed, but others from the radical wing of the Republican Party, including Representative Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts, continued to work for its enactment.|$|E

Ignatiev asserts that the only logical explanation for this notion is that people are members of different racial categories because society assigns people to these categories.|$|R

5|$|Federal {{and state}} laws {{regulating}} hours, wages, {{and working conditions}} changed markedly in the United States during the early 20thcentury. The state's Industrial Welfare Commission, established in 1913, ruled in 1914 that <b>women</b> <b>could</b> not work in laundries for more than 54 hours a week, and that work days were not to exceed nine hours. The commission established a minimum weekly wage of $8.25 for women working in Portland's laundries. By 1917, the work day was reduced to an eight-hour maximum. In 1920, to lower costs related to regulations {{and the rise of}} organized labor, several industrial laundries in Portland combined to form the Home Services Company. The new company lowered overhead by sharing resources, and added a pickup and delivery service popular among middle-class families. The company acquired the Yale Union Laundry in 1927.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{unlimited}} Convention of 1901–02, {{twentieth century}} constitutional activity {{turned to a}} mixture of Governor-appointed constitutional commissions in 1927 and 1968, and limited constitutional conventions called by the General Assembly for very specific purpose. After the century's earliest convention disenfranchising voters in a constitution that was proclaimed, each modification of the Virginia Constitution has {{been sent to the}} voters for referendum approval. Virginia's women suffrage movement was unsuccessful until the national ratification of the Twenty-first Amendment, and the General Assembly did not ratify until 1952, but <b>women</b> <b>could</b> vote beginning in 1920.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 The Scientific World Journal {{published}} research {{in which women}} with long-term problems achieving orgasm were instructed using documentation from Betty Dodson. They said the Magic Wand's large head effectively created a vibrating sensation {{in the area of}} the clitoris and vulva without superficial discomfort. Their research showed that more than 93% of a group of 500 chronically anorgasmic <b>women</b> <b>could</b> reach orgasm using Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method. The Scientific World Journal research was subsequently discussed in a literature review published in 2010 by The Journal of Sexual Medicine. Bat Sheva Marcus published a 2011 article in The Journal of Sexual Medicine after introducing women to the Magic Wand as a way to increase her subjects' levels of sexual experience and assess changes in their sexual expectations.|$|E

5|$|In Anglo-Saxon society, noblewomen enjoyed {{considerable}} {{rights and}} status, although the society was still firmly patriarchal. Some exercised power as abbesses, exerting widespread influence across the early English Church, although their wealth and authority diminished with the monastic {{reforms of the}} 9th century. Anglo-Saxon queens began to hold lands {{in their own right}} in the 10th century and their households contributed to the running of the kingdom. Although <b>women</b> <b>could</b> not lead military forces, in the absence of their husbands some noblewomen led the defence of manors and towns. Most Anglo-Saxon women, however, worked on the land as part of the agricultural community, or as brewers or bakers.|$|E
5|$|In August 1943, {{recruiting}} {{policies were}} changed to permit SPARS to marry {{men of the}} USCG without having to resign. The USCG would continue to accept applicants who were married to men in the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps, but would not accept {{a woman who was}} already married to an enlisted man or an officer serving in the USCG. However, <b>women</b> <b>could</b> join the SPARS if their husbands were enrolled as temporary members of the reserve. In November 1943, the marriage policy with respect to recruits was changed further to permit women who were wives of cadets, warrant officers, or enlisted men of the USCG to enlist or be commissioned in the SPARs. The ban remained on women whose husbands were commissioned officers in the USCG with the rank of ensign or above.|$|E
5|$|In the 1840s, {{women in}} America were {{reaching}} out for greater control of their lives. Husbands and fathers directed the lives of women, and many doors were closed to female participation. State statutes and common law prohibited women from inheriting property, signing contracts, serving on juries and voting in elections. Women's prospects in employment were dim: they could expect only to gain a very few service-related jobs and were paid about half of what men were paid for the same work. In Massachusetts, Brook Farm was founded by Sophia Ripley and her husband George Ripley in 1841 {{as an attempt to}} find a way in which men and <b>women</b> <b>could</b> work together, with women receiving the same compensation as men. The experiment failed.|$|E
