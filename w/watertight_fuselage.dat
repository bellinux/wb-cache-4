25|$|The {{standard}} carrier-based fighter of the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1926 was the Mitsubishi 1MF or Navy Type 10 Carrier Type Fighter, {{designed in}} 1921 by the ex-Sopwith British designer Herbert Smith. In April that year, a specification was issued to Mitsubishi, Aichi and Nakajima {{for a replacement}} for the Type 10, requiring the aircraft to stay afloat {{in the event of}} ditching in the sea. Mitsubishi gave the task of designing the new fighter to Joji Hattori, who had worked with Smith on the design of the Type 10. The resultant aircraft, the Experimental Taka-type (Falcon) fighter or 1MF9, was a single-bay biplane of wooden construction with fabric covering. It had a <b>watertight</b> <b>fuselage</b> and jettisonable fixed conventional landing gear to meet the Navy's ditching requirements (jettisonable because aircraft with fixed landing gear are very dangerous to land on water, since the drag from the water can easily flip the aircraft over when the wheels touch the surface), and was powered by a Mitsubishi Hi V-12 (licence-built Hispano-Suiza Lb). The pilot sat in an open cockpit, armed with two synchronised machine guns.|$|E

50|$|The Levy Biche LB 2 was {{a single}} seat French biplane fighter {{aircraft}} designed to be used from aircraft carriers. With a <b>watertight</b> <b>fuselage,</b> jettisonable wheeled undercarriage and small under-wing floats, it could survive emergency sea touchdowns; {{it could also be}} fitted with seaplane type floats.|$|E
50|$|The Levasseur PL.10 was a carrier-based {{reconnaissance}} aircraft developed in France {{in the late}} 1920s. It was a conventional, single-bay biplane along similar lines to Levasseur's contemporary designs for the French navy, including a <b>watertight,</b> boat-shaped <b>fuselage,</b> small underwing floats, and undercarriage that could be jettisoned in flight {{in order to improve}} the changes of a successful ditching.|$|R
50|$|The Levasseur PL.7 was a torpedo bomber {{developed}} in France {{in the late}} 1920s. It was a development of Levasseur's PL.4 reconnaissance aircraft and intended to replace their PL.2 then in service with the Aéronavale. It was a single-bay sesquiplane of largely conventional design, but incorporating safety features for naval operation, including jetissonable main undercarriage units, a <b>watertight,</b> boat-shaped <b>fuselage,</b> and small floats on the undersides of the lower wings.|$|R
25|$|Following {{relaxation}} {{of some of}} the specifications requirements, Blackburn constructed a second aircraft as a private venture, with a <b>watertight</b> metal monocoque <b>fuselage</b> replacing the previous steel tube fuselage, this first flying on 24 February 1933. Because it was a private venture it received and carried the Blackburn Class B civil test marking B-3 and was referred to as such, though it was also known as the M.1/30A. It performed poorly during testing, still being incapable of meeting the performance requirements of the specification even though they had been relaxed, and being too heavy for the carrier deck lifts. As none of the competitors for the specification could meet its requirements, the specification was cancelled, with no aircraft being ordered.|$|R
50|$|Seeking {{to avoid}} the {{aerodynamic}} drag induced by floats in seaplanes of floatplane design, Ing Giovanni Pegna of the Piaggio company designed a very unusual seaplane to represent Italy in the 1929 Schneider Trophy race. A cantilever shoulder-wing monoplane, known both as the Piaggio P.7 and the Piaggio-Pegna P.c.7, his design floated up to its wings on its long, slender, <b>watertight</b> <b>fuselage</b> with the wings resting on the water, and employed twin high-incidence hydrofoils to get itself off the water during takeoff runs.|$|E
50|$|Their {{contender}} {{became known}} as the B-7 after the Class B marking it carried and lacking an old-style Blackburn-type number. It was built on the Shark production line and had much in common with it. The Shark had introduced a new wing construction to Blackburn, each wing having two outward slanting (at about 45°, rather than vertical), slightly distorted N-type struts linked by a single strut from the lower front to upper rear spars. As a result of this Warren girder structure, few bracing wires compared to past practice were needed. The wings were slightly staggered and swept and had the same span and much smaller lower wing as the Shark. Unlike the Shark the wings did not fold; another significant difference was that wing area was increased to enhance the load carrying performance by increasing the chord. The B-7 shared with the Shark the semi-monocoque aluminium-clad <b>watertight</b> <b>fuselage</b> first seen on the M.1/30A and the divided main undercarriage necessitated by the torpedo-dropping role.|$|E
