The creator of NSWS, Kozo Okita, was the member of 311 earthquake disaster Committee of the Japanese Geotechnical Society. The society released a report in June, 2012 proposing to Japanese government a use of NSWS to investigate the 3.11 aftermath.|$|E
40|$|Monthly {{readings}} {{on housing}} construction and sales {{that are at}} odds with expectations are often attributed to unusual weather conditions. This paper examines the empirical relationship between <b>weather</b> <b>abnormalities</b> and housing activity. The conclusion is that unseasonable weather patterns have, at most, a slight impact on total housing starts, home sales, and the pace of construction activity. Even this weak effect is found only during the winter months. Sampling error accounts for much more of the month-to-month changes in measured housing activity than does the weather, and there is a general tendency to exaggerate the influence of unusual weather on the monthly national housing data.

40|$|For a {{long time}} I hare had a very lively {{interest}} {{in the study of}} <b>weather</b> <b>abnormalit,ies</b> {{in various parts of the}} world, not only by reason of the importance of such a study of weather phenomena, but also because eventually such studies may form the approach to the solution of the larger problem of seasonal weather forecasting. If, and when, <b>weather</b> <b>abnormalities</b> can be forecast the problem of seasonal forecasts d easily follow. I therefore, welcome the memoir here abstracted. The authors selected the period 1873 to 1900 and 114 stations, mostly in the Northern Hemisphere, as the groundwork for their study. They have used departures from normal pressure rather than charts of monthly isobars. -Ed. The 336 charts for the years 1573 to 1900 were divided into two groups, according to whether pressure at Thorshavn was above or below the nornial for the month. When the pressure at that station in any month was very nearly normal the char; for that month wa. s allocated to the positive qoup if the oceanic region between Iceland and the Bntish Isles was dominated by a positive anomaly of pressure (center of excess) and tBo the negative group if it was dominated by a negative anomaly (center of deficit). These two groups were next divided into five types according to the position of the center of the anomaly as shown in the scheme below: GROUP I. PRESSURE AT THOR- GROUP 11. PRESSURE AT THOR-SHAVN ABOVE NORMAL SHAVN BELOW NORMAL IA. Center of excess over or near Scandinavia. IB. Belt of excess from Brit,ish Isles across Europe. IC. Center of excess ove...|$|E
40|$|Recently, a {{research}} on development of evacuation route system is {{being carried out}} to handle the natural disaster occurring due to increasing <b>weather</b> <b>abnormality.</b> This paper deals with a methodology for searching evacuation route and effective traffic oper-ation when roads areas are prone to floods. The methodology is that we made activity based model by using household travel sur-vey data and then modeling it by applying a flooding scenario in traffic demand analysis program, MATSim in Ssinwol-dong, Kangseo-Gu, Seoul. Therefore, analysis of the result shows that travel pattern can be known in worst scenario cases. And {{it will be used}} effectively in decision making for evacuation route or efficient urban road operation when road area is prone to flood, o...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} three indices {{for evaluation}} of hydrometeorological extremes, considering them as areal precipitation events and trans-basin floods. In contrast to common precipitation indices, the weather extremity index (WEI) reflects not only the highest precipitation amounts at individual gauges but also the rarity of the amounts, {{the size of the}} affected area, and the duration of the event. Furthermore, the aspect of precipitation seasonality was considered when defining the <b>weather</b> <b>abnormality</b> index (WAI), which enables the detection of precipitation extremes throughout the year. The precipitation indices are complemented with the flood extremity index (FEI) employing peak discharge data. A unified design of the three indices, based on return periods of station data, enables one to compare easily inter-annual and seasonal distributions of precipitation extremes and large floods. The indices were employed in evaluation of 50 hydrometeorological extremes of each type (extreme precipitation events, seasonally abnormal precipitation events, and large floods) during the period 1961 – 2010 in the Czech Republic. A preliminary study of discrepancies among historic values of the indices indicated that variations in the frequency and/or magnitude of floods can generally be due not only to variations in the magnitude of precipitation events but also to variations in their seasonal distribution and other factors, primarily the antecedent saturation...|$|R

Aberrant <b>weather</b> and climatic <b>abnormalities</b> significantly reduced the crop productivity in present-day rain-fed agriculture. Adoption of location-specific short and medium duration varieties as well as hybrids are needed to improve livelihood of vulnerable small holders.

40|$|Traditionally, {{regulated}} utilities whose {{rates are}} determined based on cost of service invoice their customers by applying approved base rates (designed {{to recover the}} utility's allowable costs including a return on shareholders ' investment) to usage. Some regulators of utilities have also authorized the use of additional, alternative revenue programs. The major alternative revenue programs currently used are addressed in this Issue; they can generally be segregated into two categories, Type A and Type B. Type A programs adjust billings {{for the effects of}} <b>weather</b> <b>abnormalities</b> or broad external factors or to compensate the utility for demand-side management initiatives (for example, no-growth plans and similar conservation efforts). Type B programs Copyright © 1992, Financial Accounting Standards Board Not for redistribution Page 1 provide for additional billings (incentive awards) if the utility achieves certain objectives, such as reducing costs, reaching specified milestones, or demonstratively improving customer service. Both types of programs enable the utility to adjust rates in the future (usually as a surcharge applied to future billings) in response to past activities or completed events. Such adjustments can also result in refunds to customers (for example, if actual sales to ratepayers are higher tha...|$|E
40|$|Agriculture is the {{mainstay}} Tanzania’s economy and currently accounts for 90 % of rural incomes. It contributes 50 % of the GDP and accounts for 80 % of rural employment. State efforts {{to exploit the}} country’s irrigation potential are minimal due to difficulties in tapping surface and ground water. The country relies on rain fed agriculture, which is prone to <b>weather</b> <b>abnormalities</b> The energy sector is heavily dependent on wood biomass as its fuel source. Electricity provision is {{not considered to be}} a development priority especially in rural areas. Studies have shown that even with rural electrification the impact on income-generating activities among users would remain low. Even if electricity was to be supplied on a 24 -hour basis, it is unlikely {{that there would be a}} change in usage levels; the predominate reason being that the rural poor do not have the tools and knowledge necessary for effective use. Rural ecodevelopment is then not just a question of addressing poverty but also about facilitating access to education, necessary social services etc. Effective rural development is about helping people overcome their poverty. The provision of energy services therefore has to be implemented through an interdisciplinary process. Extension of the national grid is the preferred option for most end-users. However as this option is currently unrealistic other alternatives have to be utilised. In general, individual PV systems are most suitable for scattered settlements and can meet the needs for lighting and low-load service oriented businesses in rural population centresENERGY RESILLIENCEHELIO International- Tanzani...|$|E
