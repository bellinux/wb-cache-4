5|$|Sailor Brian Hancock {{encountered}} Hurricane Lili {{during the}} Route of Discovery yacht race from Benalmádena, Spain to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.Tropical Storm Lili was traveling at around 18 knots {{along the same}} path as the race fleet and was starting to pick off the slower boats. Astern of us <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> reports of gale force winds, ripped sails and some damage all the while Lili gained in strength. By our calculation we would get to the Bahamas before the storm did, but {{the problem was that}} the Bahamas were not our final destination. We had to round San Salvador and then sail just under 500 miles back toward the east, well southeast to be exact. We rounded San Salvador and sailed slap bang into the teeth of a ferocious storm. Hurricane Lili was packing around 70 to 80 knots of wind and we hove to to ride it out. I remember feeling exhilarated by it all. It helps to be a little naive and dumb but that’s how you are when you are in your 20’s.|$|E

500|$|Assistant Attorney General Paula Selis {{said the}} tactics forced some {{consumers}} {{to give in}} and pay between $20 and $100 for the service. [...] She said, [...] "We sued them because <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> complaints from consumers who {{felt that they were}} being harassed and held over a barrel for payments that they didn't agree to make." [...] Selis said, [...] "It was harassment, it was intimidation of the consumer. [...] It was using a high-pressure tactic to make him or her pay for something they were not legally obligated to pay." ...|$|E

That is the strangest curiosity yet--a really polite hotel waiter who isn't an idiot. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> used to driving right into the central court of the hotel, {{in the midst of a}} fragrant circle of vines and flowers, and in the midst also of parties of gentlemen sitting quietly reading the paper and smoking. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> used to ice frozen by artificial process in ordinary bottles --the only kind of ice they have here. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>getting</b> used to all these things, but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not <b>getting</b> used to carrying our own soap. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> sufficiently civilized to carry our own combs and toothbrushes, but this thing of having to ring for soap every time <b>we</b> wash <b>is</b> new to us and not pleasant at all. We think of it just after we get our heads and faces thoroughly wet or just when we think <b>we</b> have <b>been</b> in the bathtub long enough, and then, of course, an annoying delay follows. These Marseillaises make Marseillaise hymns and Marseilles vests and Marseilles soap for all the world, but they never sing their hymns or wear their vests or wash with their soap themselves.|$|R

500|$|With their {{previous}} albums Kid A (2000) and Amnesiac (2001), Radiohead replaced their guitar-led rock sound {{with a more}} electronic style. On tour in 2000 and 2001, the band learned how to perform the electronic music live, combining synthetic sounds with conventional rock instrumentation. Songwriter Thom Yorke said: [...] "Even with electronics, {{there is an element}} of spontaneous performance in using them. It was the tension between what's human and what's coming from the machines. That was stuff <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> into." [...] He stated that Radiohead did not want to make a [...] "big creative leap or statement" [...] with their next album.|$|E
500|$|On 20 February 1947, Attlee {{announced}} Mountbatten's appointment, {{and that}} Britain would transfer power in India {{not later than}} June 1948. Mountbatten took office as Viceroy on 24 March 1947, two days after his arrival in India. By then, the Congress had come around {{to the idea of}} partition. Nehru stated in 1960, [...] "the truth is that we were tired men and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> on in years... The plan for partition offered a way out and we took it." [...] Leaders of the Congress decided that having loosely tied Muslim-majority provinces as part of a future India was not worth the loss of the powerful government at the centre which they desired. However, the Congress insisted that if Pakistan were to become independent, Bengal and Punjab would have to be divided.|$|E
500|$|During the series' {{third season}} in 2006, despite months-long rumors of Arrested Development having {{been picked up}} by the cable {{television}} network Showtime, creator Hurwitz declined to move the show to another network. As Hurwitz explained, [...] "I had taken it as far as I felt I could as a series. I told the story I wanted to tell, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> to a point where I {{think a lot of the}} actors were ready to move on." [...] He said that he was [...] "more worried about letting down the fans in terms of the quality of the show dropping" [...] than he was about disappointing fans by not giving them more episodes. He also said, [...] "If there's a way to continue this in a form that's not weekly episodic series television, I'd be up for it".|$|E

500|$|As {{the series}} progressed during its {{broadcast}} season, the writers received frequent notes and directives from Fox network executives calling for increases and decreases in the science-fiction, comedy and traditional Western elements. Cuse said, [...] "I {{think we did}} a particularly good job of maintaining continuity with all the schizophrenic notes <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> from the network." [...] However, midway through the first season, the writers made a thematic shift from science-fiction to more comedy and adventure. Cuse said, [...] "We were biting off more than we could chew... {{we were trying to}} do a comedic action adventure Western, with tongue-in-cheek humor, genuine drama, plus science fiction. All these things added too many elements to serve simultaneously." [...] By the final third of the series, the writers had wrapped up the science-fiction plot with the Orb and focused more on traditional Western motifs.|$|E
500|$|Jeremy Egner of The New York Times {{wrote in}} his review of the episode; [...] "As with many epic sagas, the story and action in “Game of Thrones” are driven largely by {{characters}} moving toward and eventually becoming the people {{they are supposed to}} be. While we tend to focus on the big-ticket destinies, whether it’s Daenerys Targaryen emerging triumphantly from the flames last week or Jon Snow rising from the dead to fight again, the smaller figures have their own slots to fill." [...] James Hunt of What Culture noted, [...] "The Door ... delivered not only the best episode of the season to date, but one that is likely to go down as an all-time favourite." [...] Tim Surette of TV.com {{wrote in his}} review, [...] "The Door was BRUTAL in its final minutes, and you're still crying over it, admit it." [...] Lauren O'Callaghan of SFX Magazine wrote in her review, [...] "The Door, was the midseason episode. No way <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> through that without taking some serious damage to our delicate hope-filled hearts." [...] She gave the episode a 4.5 out of 5.|$|E
500|$|Truces between British and German units can be {{dated to}} early November 1914, {{around the time}} {{opposing}} armies had begun static trench warfare. At this time, both sides' rations were brought {{up to the front}} line after dusk, and soldiers on both sides noted a period of peace while they collected their food. By 1 December, a British soldier could record a friendly visit from a German sergeant one morning [...] "to see how <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> on". Relations between French and German units were generally more tense, but the same phenomenon began to emerge. In early December, a German surgeon recorded a regular half-hourly truce each evening to recover dead soldiers for burial, during which French and German soldiers exchanged newspapers. This behaviour was often challenged by junior and senior officers; the young Charles de Gaulle wrote on 7 December of the [...] "lamentable" [...] desire of French infantrymen to leave the enemy in peace, while the commander of 10th Army, Victor d'Urbal, wrote of the [...] "unfortunate consequences" [...] when men [...] "become familiar with their neighbours opposite". Other truces could be enforced on both sides by weather conditions, especially when trench lines flooded in low-lying areas, though these often lasted after the weather had cleared.|$|E

500|$|I {{started working}} at EJ's {{when it was}} a strip club in about October 1994. A couple of the key staff and I {{convinced}} the owner we would do better as a rock-'n'-roll bar, and decided to launch the new format on [...] 1, 1995. As a future rock club, we decided we needed to rethink our drink selections to suit that clientele. While comparing the prices of the domestic beers, we found that Pabst was cheapest at $33 per keg. The club gained popularity, and Pabst became the drink of choice. On Tuesdays, Pabst was sold at the full price of $1.75, but there was no cover to see the bands. Things kept getting busier. It was suggested that Thursdays become a 'beer bust,' where a patron could get unlimited Pabst between opening at 6 pm and 8 pm, when the room was cleared for the show. By this time, perhaps mid-1996, EJ's had achieved some recognition from touring bands and had a steady influx of national talent, which again increased sales. During busy months, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> three deliveries a week and moving more than 40 kegs a month. Years later, Pabst became known as the 'hipster' beer of Portland. There is no way for me to warrant that EJ's decision to make PBR its house beer caused this impact, but I have done so nonetheless, for years.|$|E
500|$|Citizen Kane was {{edited by}} Robert Wise and {{assistant}} editor Mark Robson. Both would become successful film directors. Wise was hired after Welles finished shooting the [...] "camera tests" [...] and began officially making the film. Wise said that Welles [...] "had an older editor assigned {{to him for}} those tests and evidently he was not too happy and asked to have somebody else. I was roughly Orson's age and had several good credits." [...] Wise and Robson began editing the film {{while it was still}} shooting and said that they [...] "could tell certainly that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> something very special. It was outstanding film day in and day out." [...] Welles gave Wise detailed instructions and was usually not present during the film's editing. The film was very well planned out and intentionally shot for such post-production techniques as slow dissolves. The lack of coverage made editing easy since Welles and Toland edited the film [...] "in camera" [...] by leaving few options of how it could be put together. Wise said the breakfast table sequence took weeks to edit and get the correct [...] "timing" [...] and [...] "rhythm" [...] for the whip pans and over-lapping dialogue. The News on the March sequence was edited by RKO's newsreel division to give it authenticity. They used stock footage from Pathé News and the General Film Library.|$|E
500|$|... "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] {{features}} {{the deaths of}} Patricia and Jimmy, who were both consumed by walkers. Alongside {{the deaths of the}} aforementioned characters, the episode's script initially called for the deaths of Hershel, as well as Shane Walsh and Randall, both of whom had died in the previous installment. Since Kirkman felt {{that there was a lot}} of potential development in Hershel, his death was scrapped from the script. Although plans to write off the character commenced earlier in the season, Mazzara opined that his hypothetical death would have carried no emotional resonance. [...] "The plan was always to whack Hershel, and I actually told Scott Wilson, 'Thanks for everything you've done, but in the next script we're going to kill off your character.' We started writing that and it felt like Hershel's death was playing as a plot device and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>getting</b> no emotional resonance. It was just playing as a gratuitous death. This was one of those examples where we won't play a shocking death for the sense of death; we have to get something out of it. We got nothing out of it. If you look at the shot of Hershel looking back and seeing that barn burning and his farm completely lost to the zombies, that shot was well worth it because we see the farm was really a character and you can only see that through Hershel's eyes. So it was the right call to keep him alive." ...|$|E

2500|$|Following the match, {{many former}} Australian players {{called for the}} tour to be abandoned, citing {{the safety of the}} team. Nevertheless, the series {{continued}} and Lawry's men received a positive welcome upon arrival for the Fifth Test in Madras. Lawry made 33 as Australia batted first and made 258, taking a 95-run lead. He then fell for 2 as Australia collapsed for 153 in the second innings to give the hosts an opening, but they won the match in just over three days by 77 runs to clinch the series 3–1, but Lawry's team left India with Australia's reputation severely dented. Perhaps {{as a result of the}} controversy, Lawry could only manage 239 runs at 34.14 for the series. On reflection, Lawry stated [...] "It was the toughest tour I've ever been on.
