25|$|After {{the intense}} touring {{that had been}} taking place through the first two albums, working almost 24 hours a day, basically, we managed to stop and have a proper break, {{a couple of months}} as opposed to a couple of weeks. <b>We</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> off and rent a cottage to provide a {{contrast}} to motel rooms. Obviously, it had quite an effect on the material that was written... It was the tranquility of the place that set the tone of the album. Obviously, we weren't crashing away at 100 watt Marshall stacks. Having played acoustic and being interested in classical guitar, anyway, being in a cottage without electricity, it was acoustic guitar time... After all the heavy, intense vibe of touring which is reflected in the raw energy of the second album, it was just a totally different feeling.|$|E

The following summer, the band toured as support to Mötley Crüe's Crüe Fest 2 tour and released a non-album single, [...] "Whiskey Hangover". After the tour, Godsmack started production for their new album. The album, titled The Oracle was released on , 2010. Arriving to popular reception, The Oracle is Godsmack's third straight full-length studio album to debut at No.1 with 117,000 sold {{in the first week}} of release. Erna had this to say about the early sound album, [...] "It's gonna be really heavy. I mean, it's very aggressive. I'm not really sure; it's very premature right now. Right now we just finished one track for the Crüe Fest this Summer. But as far as the whole record goes, I think it's going to be a lot more in your face.

500|$|Pavement {{was formed}} in 1989 in Stockton, California, by Stephen Malkmus and Scott Kannberg. Malkmus and Kannberg had {{previously}} performed together in the band Bag O' Bones. Pavement had its start playing at open mike nights at clubs and bars. The songs the band played during this time were mostly covers, although they also performed many original songs that would later be released on Slay Tracks. Malkmus recalls, [...] "It was pretty reasonable {{to be able to}} make a single for $1,000, so <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> for it. We didn't have any real plans because we weren't a real band." [...] Two local studios existed in Stockton, the cheaper and less professionally minded of which was Gary Young's Louder Than You Think Studio. The band decided to record at Young's studio due to their admiration of other local punk bands who had recorded there, including The Young Pioneers and The Authorities. Kannberg reportedly borrowed $800 from his father to record Slay Tracks.|$|E

Ten more gigs followed as they travelled across the UK in a van during an unannounced tour of universities, during which the band stayed in modest accommodation and received pay in coinage collected from students, while avoiding Beatles songs during their performances. McCartney later said, [...] "The main thing I didn't want was to come on stage, faced with the whole torment of five rows of press people with little pads, all looking at me and saying, 'Oh well, he is not as good as he was.' So <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out on that university tour which made me less nervous... by the end of that tour I felt ready for something else, so we went into Europe." [...] During the seven-week, 25-show Wings Over Europe Tour, the band played almost solely Wings and McCartney solo material: the Little Richard cover [...] "Long Tall Sally" [...] was the only song that had previously been recorded by the Beatles. McCartney wanted the tour to avoid large venues; most of the small halls they played had capacities of fewer than 3,000 people.|$|E

Juan Pablo Montoya clinched his fifth pole position in the Sprint Cup Series, with a time of 51.863. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Bowyer. Kurt Busch qualified third, Joe Nemechek took fourth, and Burton started fifth. The three drivers that failed to qualify for the race were Johnny Sauter, Travis Kvapil, and Landon Cassill.

In the next step, we initiated radionuclide imaging with technetium- 99 m pertechnetate (Tc- 99 m) and radioiodine (I- 123). Low uptake of Tc- 99 m and intense accumulation of I- 123 after 2 and 24 h to the mediastinal mass suggested that the mass was a mediastinal goiter.

500|$|Hollywood-based Mark Garbarino was Chopra's makeup artist. At first, {{they wanted}} her to look exactly like Kom by using {{prosthetic}} makeup. Chopra did a prosthetic test in the United States which included heavier eyelids for a more East-Asian look. However, the final result did not appeal to the makers. Also, the prosthetic would not hold during filming of the heavy-action boxing scenes. It was later reported that Chopra's look would be created post production by using visual effects. However, the results were unsatisfactory and hence this idea was also dropped. Chopra said [...] "We tried a bunch of stuff – Visual effects, prosthetics, makeup, [...] it looked too gimmicky. That's when <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> with just carrying {{the essence of the}} film, rather than the outer, cosmetic part." [...] Later, Uday Shirali, Chopra's makeup artist since Agneepath (2012), was hired. For creating boxing scars, makeup artist Subhash Shinde was employed. His biggest challenges were to make the fight marks look as realistic as possible as it required {{a lot of time and}} detailing. He stated, [...] "Every punch or scar needed to look real, change colour and age with time on screen, and shouldn't look like they were created using makeup." [...] He did some research by visiting hospitals to understand more about skin injuries.|$|E

Barbara Broccoli stated that [...] "For years, my father wanted to make Casino Royale—it's the Holy Grail... We {{wanted to make a}} tougher film, the way it should have been made years ago". Fellow producer Michael G. Wilson agreed, commenting [...] "We felt the last film was too fantastical, so <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back to the basics and update". Neal Purvis and Robert Wade began writing a screenplay at the end of February 2004, while Pierce Brosnan was still Bond. Paul Haggis was brought in later, and his main contribution included rewriting the climax of the film. He explained that [...] "the draft that was there was very faithful to the book and there was a confession, so in the original draft the character confessed and killed herself. She then sent Bond to chase after the villains; Bond chased the villains into the house. I don't know why but I thought that Vesper [...] had to be in the sinking house and Bond has to want to kill her and then try and save her". In February 2005 Martin Campbell was announced as the film's director and the next Bond film was revealed to be Casino Royale, although the identity of the new Bond was still unknown; the producers had chosen not to renew Pierce Brosnan's contract, and in October Eon announced that the part of Bond would be taken by Daniel Craig.|$|E

2500|$|Juri's {{character}} {{concept was}} created from a suggestion by Yoshinori Ono {{to introduce a}} female Korean character into the Street Fighter series, with the initial design selected from 400-500 ideas, amongst which included an old woman and an ice skater. The final concept {{was intended to be}} someone [...] "bad and somewhat erotic," [...] with taekwondo selected as her martial art over suggestions such as a sports-themed style, due to its lack of representation in the series and feeling that a character that used primarily kicks could be interesting. A mixed martial arts style was also considered, but the team chose to focus on a more iconic fighting style. Ono stated that they were planning on adding a Korean character since soon after Street Fighter II became popular in Korea. However, the Korean government had a strict limitation against the Japanese language and culture, preventing them from including such a character. Tekken has had Korean characters since 1995, Fatal Fury has had Korea characters since 1992, so this excuse of the Korean government limitations might not be accurate. After the release of Street Fighter IV, Capcom Korea demanded to Ono that should another Street Fighter game be released, that it include a Korean character. While other fighting games had Korean characters already, Capcom Korea and Korean fighting game fans held the sentiment that it didn't matter [...] "unless there was one in the series that started it all." [...] Ono commented that when a new character is introduced, [...] "you want to make them a good guy, you know a 'fighter for justice' or a 'friend of good' so to speak, but this time <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> kind of a different route with this character." [...] He went on to describe her as [...] "kind of nasty, she's kind of mean—somewhat twisted in fact." [...] The developers debated which of the game's villains to align her with, M. Bison or Seth, before settling on the latter due to her being a new addition to the series.|$|E

After noting that the need to explore is intrinsic to life itself, Mr. Goldin presents several reasons why we should <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the Moon and <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Mars.
