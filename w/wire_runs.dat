2500|$|The {{process of}} border {{demarcation}} continued in February 2013. Russian troops started {{the installation of}} barbed wire barriers to separate the South Ossetian territory {{from the rest of}} Georgia. In some instances, the Georgian residents could not access their plots or come out of their homes because the border of barbed <b>wire</b> <b>runs</b> through or around their property. According to Georgia's Interior Ministry, there was no fencing activities at the administrative border of Georgia’s other breakaway region of Abkhazia, where the Enguri river served as [...] "a natural dividing line", but Russian troops were blocking the pathways to prevent [...] "illegal" [...] movement across the administrative boundary line. The new South Ossetia-Georgia border extended between 50–300 meters beyond the occupation line. By August 2013, an estimated 27 kilometers of barriers had been built.|$|E

50|$|According to the 2010 census, the {{township}} has a total area of 23.7 sq mi, all land. The streams of Bit Run, Corrode Run, Cowboy Run, Crooked Creek, Harris Creek, Holster Creek, Mud Creek, Oak Run, Oval Run, Phillips Run, Rustic <b>Run</b> and <b>Wire</b> <b>Run</b> run through this township.|$|R
50|$|Baqa al-Gharbiyye is {{separated}} from its West Bank sister city, Baqa ash-Sharqiyya (or Baqa East), by the Israeli West Bank barrier which in this section coincides with the Green Line. As a result, a concrete wall topped with barbed <b>wire</b> <b>runs</b> through one neighbourhood.|$|E
50|$|Surface-mount {{ferrite beads}} are available. These are {{soldered}} into {{a gap in}} the printed circuit board trace, just like any other surface mount inductor. Inside the bead component, a coil of <b>wire</b> <b>runs</b> between layers of ferrite to form a multi-turn inductor around the high permeability core.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, the two {{countries}} agreed to construct just one wall along the border which would be just inside Thai territory. The new border wall is 2.5 m high and {{made up of a}} concrete lower half and steel fencing on the upper half. At the base, barbed <b>wire</b> <b>runs</b> {{along the length of the}} wall.|$|E
50|$|Nearly all biplane {{aircraft}} {{have their}} {{upper and lower}} planes connected by interplane struts, with the upper wing running across above the fuselage and connected to it by shorter cabane struts. These struts divide the wings into bays which are braced by diagonal wires. The flying <b>wires</b> <b>run</b> upwards and outwards from the lower wing, while the landing <b>wires</b> <b>run</b> downwards and outwards from the upper wing. The resulting combination of struts and wires is a rigid box girder-like structure independent of its fuselage mountings.|$|R
50|$|In Milan, most tram lines cross its {{circular}} trolleybus line once or twice. Trolleybus and tram <b>wires</b> <b>run</b> {{parallel in}} streets such as viale Stelvio and viale Tibaldi.|$|R
50|$|For short <b>wiring</b> <b>runs</b> {{limited by}} {{conductor}} ampacity, this allows three half-sized conductors to {{be substituted for}} two full-sized ones, using 75% of the copper of an equivalent single-phase system.|$|R
5000|$|It can {{be shown}} from the Biot-Savart law that {{at one end of}} a semi-infinite {{current-carrying}} wire, the magnetic field at a given perpendicular distance (...) {{from the end of the}} wire is given by:Note this is if the <b>wire</b> <b>runs</b> from the location of the armature e.g. from x = 0 back to [...] and [...] is measured relative to the axis of the wire.|$|E
50|$|A small reel {{of copper}} wire {{coated with a}} special {{insulating}} varnish is mounted {{on the end of}} the tool. The <b>wire</b> <b>runs</b> down a thin tube in the center of the wiring pencil and the wiring pencil can be used to quickly and tightly wrap it onto connections and take it across the circuit board. Then the connections are soldered; the heat of the molten solder burns the varnish away and completes the joint.|$|E
50|$|When {{using this}} system, one {{must take into}} {{consideration}} the actual application, since controlling office lights {{is not the same as}} controlling theatrical lighting. 0-10 V lighting control is widely used in commercial and industrial lighting by ballast manufacturers such as GE, Philips, Universal, Metrolight, Sylvania, Creative Lighting, and Lumascape. There are distributed control approaches on the market today that can be installed inside or very near the fixture(s) to be controlled thus eliminating the <b>wire</b> <b>runs</b> and the voltage drop.|$|E
50|$|Since <b>wires</b> <b>run</b> in {{conduits}} or underground cannot dissipate heat {{as easily}} as in open air, and since adjacent circuits contribute induced currents, wiring regulations give rules to establish the current capacity (ampacity).|$|R

50|$|Looking for {{a launch}} customer, Ferranti signed up Prudential Assurance {{with the promise}} to deliver the machine in 1960. However, these plans quickly went awry. The Neuron proved unable to be adapted to the larger {{physical}} size of the Orion. Keeping the current levels steady over the longer <b>wire</b> <b>runs</b> was extremely difficult, and efforts to cure the problems resulted in lengthy delays. The first Orion was eventually delivered, but was over a year late and unit cost was more than expected, limiting its sales. Between 1962 and 1964 the Computing Division lost $7.5 million, {{largely as a result}} of the Orion.|$|E
50|$|Convinced that Neuron {{was a major}} advance, Ferranti R&D {{proposed}} a much larger machine {{based on the same}} logic, one that would have even greater price advantages over traditional designs. The new machine was aimed at the business market, not their traditional high-performance niche, and Prudential plc signed up as a launch customer while several other large insurance firms followed. Emerging as the Ferranti Orion in 1961, the system proved to be a disaster. As the machine was much larger than the Sirius physically, it had longer <b>wire</b> <b>runs</b> and thus required larger currents to operate the Neurons. Electrical noise and settling times were major issues, and Orion was much slower than promised.|$|E
50|$|Erik T. W. Addyman {{designed}} and built his STG single seat primary glider for low cost basic training. As such, it was a simple, wooden, aerodynamically unrefined aircraft with a relatively low aspect ratio wing, a cockpit nacelle under it and a flat open truss girder fuselage aft. The unswept wing had parallel chord with blunt tips and was built around two spars. There were no flaps or airbrakes. Above the wing landing <b>wires</b> <b>ran</b> from about mid-span on each wing from the spars {{to the top of}} a centrally mounted inverted V-strut; below, similarly arranged flying <b>wires</b> <b>ran</b> to the lower nacelle longerons.|$|R

Twenty-seven copper <b>wires</b> <b>ran</b> from microphone receivers in the Opera House to the central office, where the current would pass through a patented device that increased the sound. A main <b>wire</b> <b>ran</b> to each district, with branch wires to individual houses. The distribution to subscribers was regulated by another patented device.|$|R
50|$|More recent {{clinical}} applications {{can be seen}} in surgeries used {{to treat}} Parkinson's disease, such as Pallidotomy or Thalamotomy (lesioning procedures), or Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). During DBS, an electrode is placed into the thalamus, the pallidum of the subthalmamic nucleus, parts of brain that are involved in motor control, and are affected by Parkinson's disease. The electrode is connected to a small battery operated stimulator that is placed under the collarbone, where a <b>wire</b> <b>runs</b> beneath the skin to connect it to the electrode in the brain. The stimulator produces electrical impulses that affect the nerve cells around the electrode and should help alleviate tremors or symptoms that are associated with the affected area.|$|E

5000|$|AFDX was {{designed}} as the next-generation aircraft data network. Basing on standards from the IEEE 802.3 committee (commonly known as Ethernet) allows commercial off-the-shelf hardware to reduce costs and development time. AFDX is one implementation of deterministic Ethernet defined by ARINC Specification 664 Part 7. AFDX was developed by Airbus Industries for the A380, initially to address real-time issues for flight-by-wire system development. Building on the experience from the A380, the Airbus A350 also uses an AFDX network, with avionics and systems supplied by Rockwell Collins. Airbus and its EADS parent company have made AFDX licenses available through the EADS Technology Licensing initiative, including agreements with Selex ES and Vector Informatik GmbH. A [...] of deterministic Ethernet is used on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Multiple switches can be bridged together in a cascaded star topology. This type of network can significantly reduce <b>wire</b> <b>runs</b> and, thus, the overall weight of the aircraft. In addition, AFDX can provide quality of service and dual link redundancy.|$|E
50|$|Longer <b>wiring</b> <b>runs</b> {{are more}} limited by voltage {{drop in the}} conductors. Because the supply voltage is doubled, a {{balanced}} load can tolerate double the voltage drop, allowing quarter-sized conductors to be used; this uses 3/8 the copper of an equivalent single-phase system.|$|R
60|$|When {{that man}} {{reached the point}} in the creek to which he was bound, and, with his trunk on his shoulder, walked up to the house where he used to live, he was still more astonished; for a {{telegraph}} <b>wire</b> <b>ran</b> through one corner of the back yard.|$|R
50|$|Wire wrap {{was invented}} to wire {{telephone}} crossbar switches, and later adapted to construct electronic circuit boards. Electronic components mounted on an insulating board are interconnected by lengths of insulated <b>wire</b> <b>run</b> between their terminals, with the connections made by wrapping several turns around a component lead or a socket pin.|$|R
50|$|The unit is {{composed}} of a probe; a wire link; and a shipboard canister. Inside of the probe is a thermistor which is connected electronically to a chart recorder. The probe falls freely at 20 feet per second and that determines its depth and provides a temperature-depth trace on the recorder. A pair of fine copper wires which pay out from both a spool retained on the ship and one dropped with the instrument, provide a data transfer line to the ship for shipboard recording. Eventually, the <b>wire</b> <b>runs</b> out and breaks, and the XBT sinks to the ocean floor. Since the deployment of an XBT {{does not require the}} ship to slow down or otherwise interfere with normal operations, XBT's are often deployed from vessels of opportunity, such as cargo ships or ferries, rather than a dedicated research ship where a CTD would normally be used in preference. Airborne versions (AXBT) are also used; these use radio frequencies to transmit the data to the aircraft during deployment. Today Lockheed Martin Sippican has manufactured over 5 million XBTs.|$|E
40|$|The {{magnetic}} field around various geometries of conductors {{can be observed}} using iron filings. While the current is running through the wire, iron filings are sprinkled onto a plastic sheet through which the <b>wire</b> <b>runs,</b> and the plate is gently tapped, producing the iron filing configuration which illustrates the {{magnetic field}} in {{the plane of the}} plastic sheet, as in Figure 1 for the case of the solenoid...|$|E
