5000|$|Emergency <b>Wreck</b> <b>Marking</b> <b>Buoy</b> : a new buoy {{introduced}} in 2006, marking a new wreck. It replaces the double cardinal or lateral marks (IALA Recommendation O-133).|$|E
2500|$|Survivors and {{relatives}} {{of those who}} died went on to form the Piper Alpha Families and Survivors Association, which campaigns on North Sea safety issues. The <b>wreck</b> <b>buoy</b> <b>marking</b> the remains of the Piper is approximately 1.1 nautical miles from the replacement Piper Bravo platform. A lasting effect of the Piper Alpha disaster was the establishment of Britain's first [...] "post-Margaret Thatcher" [...] trade union, the Offshore Industry Liaison Committee.|$|R
5000|$|Piper Bravo is an eight-legged fixed steel jacket {{supported}} platform, located 193 kilometres {{northeast of}} Aberdeen {{in the central}} North Sea. It stands in 145 metres of water. It was installed in 1992, and commenced production in February 1993. It replaced the Piper Alpha platform which exploded in July 1988 killing 167 men. It is located approximately 800 metres from the <b>wreck</b> <b>buoy</b> <b>marking</b> the remains of its precursor (at [...] ).|$|R

50|$|At Praia de Meireles, both {{team members}} had {{to swim in}} the sea over a longboard until they reached a <b>marked</b> <b>buoy.</b> Once in the buoy, teams would find a small Race flag which teams would have to carry to the shore and {{exchange}} it for their next clue.|$|R

50|$|The {{ship has}} since become a popular dive site, <b>marked</b> by <b>buoys.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{entrance}} to the port is a dredged channel, 8 m deep, below the hydrographic zero and 90 m long. The access channel itself is two nautical miles (4 km) long, on a 184°5 axis, indicated by aligned luminous signalling. The channel, 150 m wide is bordered, to the West and the East by three sea <b>mark</b> <b>buoys.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Detour was {{a choice}} between Acquaball (Aquaball) and Tif. In Acquaball, one team member at a time had to get into an acquaball and then run over the water until they reached a <b>marked</b> <b>buoy</b> {{and then return to}} the shore. Once both team members {{completed}} the course, they would receive their next clue. In Tif, one team member at a time had to use a tif system (similar to Paddleboarding) that included two small tables (one for each foot) and two oars to paddle to the <b>marked</b> <b>buoy</b> and then return to the shore in order to receive their next clue. In {{the first half of this}} Leg's Roadblock, one team member had to climb to the top of a climbing wall until they reached a Rexona Clinical deodorant. Teams had to then carry the deodorant to the base of the climbing wall and exchange it for their next clue.|$|R
25|$|Then, while Pursuit placed <b>marked</b> <b>buoys,</b> Requisite led both Ringgold and Dashiell {{into the}} lagoon. They sped into the lagoon while {{under fire from}} shore batteries. Ringgold took two hits, both duds, {{although}} one managed to knock out her port engine. Her Chief Engineer, Lt. Comdr. Wayne A. Parker, {{is said to have}} imitated the legendary Dutch boy by plugging a hole with his body while emergency repairs were made.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Marker</b> <b>buoys</b> - used in naval warfare, {{particularly}} anti-submarine warfare, is a light-emitting or smoke-emitting, or both, marker {{using some}} kind of pyrotechnic to provide the flare and smoke. It is commonly a 3-inch (76 mm) diameter device about 20 inches (500 mm) long that is set off by contact with seawater and floats on the surface. Some markers extinguish after a set period and others are made to sink.|$|R
5000|$|In January 2007, after looting of {{the cargo}} of the {{container}} ship, the MSC Napoli, acting Receiver of <b>Wreck</b> <b>Mark</b> Rodaway said he would invoke powers of this Act {{for the first time}} in 100 years, although the extant powers to which he referred are actually held under the more recent, replacement, legislation.|$|R
50|$|THV Alert (2006) is a 39.3 m Rapid Intervention Vessel, able {{to respond}} rapidly to {{maritime}} incidents on the southeast coast of England. She is capable of <b>buoy</b> handling, <b>wreck</b> <b>marking</b> and towing. Fitted with multibeam and side scan hydrographic surveying capability and DP1 dynamic positioning, Alert can be utilised as a research platform with a large working deck.|$|R

50|$|A {{total of}} 500 (of which 140 are lighted) River <b>Marks</b> and <b>Buoys</b> are {{maintained}} by the KoPT. These are extremely useful in facilitating night navigation, pilotage and dredging. These lights are operated either by grid electricity, by battery or by dissolved Marine Acetylene Gas. There is also 1 boat buoy, 30 lighted buoys and 72 unlit <b>buoys</b> <b>marking</b> the navigational channel from Sandheads to Kolkata.|$|R
5000|$|There is an MOD {{firing range}} in the area with brightly {{coloured}} floating targets deployed. The southern limit is <b>marked</b> by <b>buoys</b> [...] SSE of The Scares.|$|R
25|$|A diver who has {{deployed}} a Delayed Surface <b>Marker</b> <b>Buoy</b> (DSMB) {{at the end}} of a dive may use a pre-arranged {{colour code}} to indicate if there is a problem. In some circles a yellow DSMB is considered an emergency signal, and red means OK. In most circles a second DSMB deployed on the same line will indicate a problem. A DSMB can also be used to carry up a slate with a message, but this is unlikely to be noticed unless a special arrangement has been made.|$|R

2500|$|By that time, McCroskey had fled, {{stealing}} and <b>wrecking</b> <b>Mark</b> Niederbrock's 2000 Honda. [...] Unaware of the murders, {{a deputy}} issued him a summons for driving {{without a license}} but did not arrest him. Prince Edward Sheriff's Sgt. Stuart Raybold {{said at the time}} {{there was no reason for}} the deputy to be suspicious. During this time, McCroskey made a call to confess he had just killed the victims.|$|R

50|$|A {{cardinal}} mark is a sea <b>mark</b> (a <b>buoy</b> or other floating or fixed structure) used in maritime pilotage {{to indicate the}} position of a hazard and the direction of safe water.|$|R
5000|$|From December 16, Corregidor {{lighthouse}} {{was used}} by the Navy to facilitate the entrance of submarines carrying supplies and ammunition for the troops on the island as authorized by General Douglas MacArthur. The light was shown the first ten minutes of each one-half hour on a secret schedule furnished by the Navy for each entry. Only white light was shown and on a fixed specified azimuth. As the submarine passes through the controlled mine fields, the Inshore Patrol coordinating with the Harbor Defense put the mines on [...] "safe" [...] and the <b>marking</b> <b>buoys</b> were illuminated by searchlights.|$|R

50|$|Overseas, Serco Marine Services {{undertake}} similar {{activities in}} locations such as Gibraltar, the Falklands, and the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia in Cyprus, {{which includes the}} maintenance of navigational <b>marks</b> (or <b>buoys)</b> and supporting military operations and training.|$|R

50|$|Before 1912, the shoal {{surrounding}} the point had been <b>marked</b> by <b>buoys.</b> The Buffalo Lightship, a lightship built in 1912, was {{installed at the}} site, but the violent Great Lakes Storm of 1913 sank the vessel and killed all its crew in November 1913.|$|R
25|$|The swim leg usually {{proceeds}} {{around a}} series of <b>marked</b> <b>buoys</b> before athletes exit the water near the transition area. Racers exit out of the water, enter the transition area, and change from their swim gear and into their cycling gear. Competition and pressure for faster times {{have led to the}} development of specialized triathlon clothing that is adequate for both swimming and cycling, allowing many racers to have a transition that consists of only removing their wetsuit, cap, and goggles and pulling on a helmet and cycling shoes. In some cases, racers leave their cycling shoes attached to their bicycle pedals and slip their feet into them while riding. Some triathletes don't wear socks, decreasing their time spent in transition even more.|$|R
