5|$|Several laws {{dealt with}} indentured servitude, a legal status whereby {{a person would}} <b>work</b> <b>off</b> debts or be given {{training}} {{in exchange for a}} period of unrecompensed service. The law required that all indentured servants had to be registered by the Governor or one of the Assistants, and that no period of indenture could be less than six months. Further laws forbade a master from shortening the length of time of service required for his servant, and also confirmed that any indentured servants whose period of service began in England would still be required to complete their service while in Plymouth.|$|E

25|$|It {{happens in}} every {{industry}} {{to millions of}} workers.

25|$|Amongst the work's {{innovations}} {{is one of}} {{the earliest}} descriptions of purgatory as the place where each soul would have to <b>work</b> <b>off</b> its debts after death before entering heaven. Hildegard's descriptions of the possible punishments there are often gruesome and grotesque, which emphasize the work's moral and pastoral purpose as a practical guide to the life of true penance and proper virtue.|$|E

25|$|The Low Country {{was settled}} first, {{dominated}} by wealthy English men who became owners of {{large amounts of}} land on which they established plantations.

Planters also imported African laborers to the colony.|$|E
25|$|One alleged {{example of}} the Church's {{possible}} brainwashing tactics is the Rehabilitation Project Force, to which church staff are assigned to <b>work</b> <b>off</b> alleged wrongdoings under conditions that many critics characterize as degrading. Some of these allegations are presented in Stephen Kent's Brainwashing in Scientology's Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF). Articles that claim to rebut those charges include Juha Pentikäinen's The Church of Scientology's Rehabilitation Project Force.|$|E
25|$|Three sets of train crew, being driver, fireman {{and guard}} (one fireman's post {{was not being}} filled). The drivers did not <b>work</b> <b>off</b> the EKLR.

25|$|Bradstreet was not {{responsible}} for her writing becoming public. Bradstreet's brother-in-law, John Woodbridge, sent her <b>work</b> <b>off</b> to be published. Bradstreet was a righteous woman and her poetry {{was not meant to}} bring attention to herself. Though Bradstreet's works are renowned in today's world, it still was a great risk to have had her work published during the time in which she lived. Her being a published author would have not been considered as a typical role of the Puritan woman.|$|E
25|$|Other {{legislative}} initiatives by the Conservatives benefited {{its primary}} supporters, the planters and business class. Taxes {{across the board}} were reduced, and funding was cut for public social and educational programs that assisted poor whites and blacks. Oral contracts were made to be legally binding, breach of contract was enforced as a criminal offense, and those in debt to planters {{could be forced to}} <b>work</b> <b>off</b> their debt. In addition, the University of South Carolina along with The Citadel were reopened to elite classes and generously supported by the state government.|$|E

After Unalga was sold in 1946, she was renamed after Jewish Agency leader Haim Arlosoroff and used for six months for moving Jewish {{refugees}} from Europe to Palestine before being forced to run aground by British Navy ships near Haifa.|$|E
25|$|If a debtor {{were seized}} for debt, he could {{nominate}} as mancipium, or hostage to <b>work</b> <b>off</b> the debt, his wife, child, or slave.

If the mancipium died a natural death while in the creditor's possession, no claim could lie against the latter; {{but if he was}} the cause of death by cruelty, he had to give son for son, or pay for a slave. He could sell a slave-hostage, but not a slave-girl who had borne her master children; she had to be redeemed by her owner.|$|E
25|$|When Curtis was eight, he and {{his brother}} Julius were placed in an orphanage for a month because their parents could not afford to feed them. Four years later, Julius was struck and killed by a truck. Curtis joined a {{neighborhood}} gang whose main crimes were playing hooky from school and minor pilfering at the local dime store. When Curtis was 11, a friendly neighbor saved him from what he felt would have led to a life of delinquency by sending him to a Boy Scout camp, where he was able to <b>work</b> <b>off</b> his energy and settle down. He attended Seward Park High School. At 16, he had his first small acting part in a school stage play.|$|E

25|$|Tatsuro Udo, battle {{programmer}} for Eternia, Rebirth and Graces, {{helped design}} the battle system. During {{the beginning of}} development, the team had to recreate the basic gameplay from the Xillia games to <b>work</b> <b>off,</b> which proved a difficult task for the team. The battle system was intended to combine familiar elements from previous installments with new ideas intended to refresh the series. Creating the seamless transition between exploration and combat, as well as implementing Armitization, proved to {{be difficult for the}} team. The idea of encountering and fighting enemies in the same space as exploration was designed to help evoke a fresh sense of adventure for players, as the team felt the previous method of transferring to a separate battle arena was limiting the series' development. Until the battle system's completion, development of other systems related to it was slow. As part of this development, a completely new engine had to be developed for the game, rather than just modified their old engine {{as they did in the}} past. Because of a staff shortage, developing the game was harder than previous titles and took a longer time. The PlayStation 3 was chosen as the original platform of release as the next generation of gaming hardware had yet to take off in Japan in terms of sales, and Bandai Namco was unwilling to take the risk of releasing on platforms with low install bases.|$|E
25|$|With his description, it is {{seen that}} the {{out-of-date}} Chinese term for pestle and mortar (dui, tui) would soon be replaced with the Chinese term for the water-powered trip-hammer (Chinese: 水碓 Pinyin: shui dui; Wade–Giles: shui tui). The Han Dynasty scholar and poet Ma Rong (79–166 AD) mentioned {{in one of his}} poems of hammers 'pounding in the water-echoing caves'. As described in the Hou Han Shu, in 129 AD the official Yu Xu gave a report to Emperor Shun of Han that trip hammers were being exported from Han China to the Western Qiang people by way of canals through the Qilian Mountains. In his Rou Xing Lun, the government official Kong Rong (153–208 AD) remarked that the invention of the trip hammer was an excellent example of a product created by intelligent men during his own age (comparing the relative achievements of the sages of old). During the 3rd century AD, the high government official and engineer Du Yu established the use of combined trip hammer batteries (lian zhi dui), which employed several shafts that were arranged to <b>work</b> <b>off</b> one large waterwheel. In Chinese texts of the 4th century, there are written accounts of men possessing and operating hundreds of trip hammer machines, such as the venerable mathematician Wang Rong (died 306 AD), Deng Yu (died 326 AD), and Shi Chong (died 300 AD), responsible for the operation of hundreds of trip hammers in over thirty governmental districts throughout China. There are numerous references to trip hammers during the Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD) and Song Dynasty (960–1279), and there are Ming Dynasty (1368–1644) references that report the use of trip hammers in papermills of Fujian Province.|$|E
