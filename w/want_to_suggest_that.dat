Nonetheless, news of the atomic bombing was greeted enthusiastically in the U.S.; a poll in Fortune magazine in late 1945 showed a significant minority of Americans (22.7%) wishing that more atomic bombs could have been dropped on Japan.

40|$|This {{paper is}} called ‘Specific gravity’ because it <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> {{there is a}} deep import, a weight, a gravitas to the {{specific}} details of ordinary cultural practices. It is in four sections. The first opens up the perennial question ‘What is culture?’. It considers this question {{in terms of how}} {{it may or may not}} be answered, drawing on Wittgenstein’s remarks against essentialism, and on (as with Wittgenstein) anecdotes from everyday experiences and their logical consequences. Some comparisons between this outline and two recent contributions to cultural history are then made to set the scene for the promised alternative. The second section deals with sheer ordinariness as an analytically complex phenomenon. It draws on the work of Alfred Schütz and Harvey Sacks to show how the often-missed ordinariness of everyday affairs may be the key topic for understanding and analysing culture. The next section goes a little further into this same — routinely overlooked, perhaps because so obvious — territory by rehearsing an example from one of Sacks’s lectures on the everyday cultural practice of ‘tearing down’. It attempts to draw a distinction between lay and professional analysis that could give cultural analysis a disciplinary footing without resorting to ‘positivism’ and/or the view that lay reasoning is inferior to its scientific counterparts. Finally, in the fourth section, I deal with a collection of textual materials, all of which mobilise the term ‘culture’ and the concept of culture for specific moral purposes. The paper concludes with some hypotheses about ordinary, everyday uses of the idea of culture and how they might be worked with (or on) to form the basis of an alternative specification of culture...|$|R

Lionnel Luca, {{a member of the}} National Assembly for the UMP, appealed for a review by the Defence Historical Service as soon as he heard about the project. Guy Pervillé deplored the inevitable acceptance by moviegoers of the film as representing historical truth. The Defence Historical Service claimed that [...] "the errors and anachronisms are so many and so gross that they can be identified by any historian ... The numerous improbabilities present in the scenario show that the writing of the latter was not preceded by a serious historical study." [...] The center of the controversy was the depiction of the 1945 Sétif massacre early in the film. The report elaborated, [...] "The director <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> on May 8, 1945, Muslims in Sétif were blindly massacred by Europeans, whereas it's the contrary that transpired. ... All historians agree that ... Europeans lashed out against Muslims in response to Muslims massacring Europeans." [...] This reaction is at odds with mainstream history, which concluded that, after restoring order in the town, French military and police then carried out a series of reprisals and summary executions of native civilians. Before even seeing the film, Luca also criticized the decision to give public funding to a film which he considered [...] "anti-French". Mustapha Orif, one of the film's co-producers, responded to the accusations and defended the film's portrayal of the massacre. [...] "Rachid Bouchareb interviewed many people, witnesses and historians. From this point of view, I do not think at all that he has deviated from historical reality," [...] he said.|$|R
