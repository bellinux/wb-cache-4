Bilheimer, who had received an Academy Award nomination for The Cry of Reason, said that [...] "the unrelenting, unpunished, and craven exploitation of millions of human beings for labor, sex, and hundreds of sub-categories thereof is simply the most appalling and damaging expression of so-called human civilization we have ever seen."

[...] Bilheimer found that the connections he had made during the production of A Closer Walk were also useful when producing Not My Life because {{the poor and the}} outcast are at the greatest risk of both HIV/AIDS and human trafficking; there is, for this reason, much overlap between the groups victimized by these two afflictions.

This is a powerful tool for the collector to use to get the subject talking. The desire to talk may also be manifested in refugees, DPs, and even local civilians when confronted by an unsettled situation.|$|E
5000|$|Certain {{tourist resort}} {{operators}} were alarmed about the PLO having {{a foothold in}} the Maldives and the German press echoed those concerns, for the biggest share of tourist arrivals to the Maldives was from Germany. In 1986, the airline went bankrupt. In 1987 the two Maldives Airways DC-8s were sold to Connie Kalitta Services. People in the Maldives don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> defunct airline now, especially local government officials. Like in the Air Maldives bankruptcy, a great part of the blame is put on former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom's wish of having a Maldivian prestige international airline at any cost, regardless of the company's shady financial operations.|$|E

Olivet counselors are not permitted to counsel them according to University policy." [...] If a student is attempting to overcome homosexual tendencies, the University will accept them into counseling services. The only way that ONU will not accept a student into the counseling program is if the purpose of the counseling is directly related to accepting their homosexuality. In addition, if this is the case, Olivet will refer the student to an outside counseling agency.|$|E

5000|$|Day {{turned down}} the offer because the nudity {{required}} by the role offended her. Nichols' actual first choice for Mrs. Robinson was French actor Jeanne Moreau. The idea behind this {{was that in the}} French culture, the [...] "older" [...] women tended to [...] "train" [...] the younger men in sexual matters. Joan Crawford inquired as to play the part, while Lauren Bacall and Audrey Hepburn both wanted the role. Patricia Neal {{turned down the}} film as she had recently recovered from a stroke and did not feel ready to accept such a major role. Geraldine Page also turned it down. Other actors considered for the part included Claire Bloom, Angie Dickinson, Sophia Loren, Judy Garland, Rita Hayworth, Susan Hayward, Anouk Aimee, Jennifer Jones, Deborah Kerr, Eva Marie Saint, Rosalind Russell, Simone Signoret, Jean Simmons, Lana Turner, Eleanor Parker, Anne Baxter and Shelley Winters. Angela Lansbury also asked about playing the part. Ava Gardner sought the role of Mrs. Robinson, and reportedly called Nichols saying,"I want to see you! I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> Graduate thing!" [...] Nichols did not seriously consider her for the role (he wanted a younger woman as Bancroft was 36 and Gardner was 45), but did end up visiting her hotel.

3000|$|Thus, {{consumers}} {{were perceived}} to have little knowledge of the topics of death and dying. This resulted {{from a lack of}} prior experience due to long repurchase cycles and the lack of the legitimacy of an open discourse in society. Accordingly, the incumbents perceived that consumers would “not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> topic” (Expert 6) between deaths, which explained the industry’s hesitance toward pre-order marketing activities. Furthermore, this premise of consumer “nescience” implied that the funeral homes’ central counseling competence unfolded its value. In this way, the funeral homes could leverage their counseling competence, which constituted their identity as experts who understood the daily realities of funerals, or, as Expert 5 stated, “the view that funeral directors have is not the view that the bereaved have.” [...]...|$|E

40|$|Can I {{begin by}} saying {{what a great}} {{privilege}} {{it is to be}} asked to deliver the SirJohn Barry Memorial Lecture. I feel somewhat overawed at speaking in the shadow of such a major legal thinker and activist. The theme of this year’s Australian and New Zealand Society of Criminology Conference, is “Criminology in the 21 st Century: Public Good or Private Interest?” and I have taken that as the title and theme of what I want to talk about. However, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> not in the sense of whether criminal justice services should be privatised, but in the sense of whether criminology is a public good or a private interest. Taken in this way, the theme is particularly apposite to my recent experience. For most of my working life I have been an academic criminologist — latterly as a professor of criminology and for a while the Dean of a law school. However, just over 18 months ago, I left academia and became a civil servant. In the argot of the British press I moved from being a Don to a Mandarin. I was appointed {{as a member of the}} Management Board of the Home Office in London and as their Director of Research, Development and Statistics.

40|$|Purpose This {{article has}} four aims, firstly to {{consider}} the reported problems in sexual function caused by psychotropic medication. Secondly the complex undertaking of completing an assessment of sexual functioning. Thirdly {{the role of the}} pharmaceutical industry is explored. Finally implications for future research and practice are suggested. Design/methodology/approach As a commentary this paper draws on the available literature to synthesise what is already known about the relationship between psychoactive substances and sexual functioning. Findings The limited literature and lack of research attention given to psychotropic induced sexual dysfunction limits our collective understanding of how many people are affected and in what way. Research limitations/implications A greater focus on psychotropic induced sexual dysfunction is needed for people with a dual diagnosis. There has been an over reliance on single case studies and self reporting. Large scale epidemiological investigation would help us understand the extent and nature of the problem more fully. The demographic shift particularly in relation to an ageing population should be considered as psychotropic substances effect individuals in different ways as they grow older. Practical implications There is scope for workers to engage more fully in a conversation with clients about their experience of using psychotropic substances and how this has impacted their sexual functioning. The literature suggests that clients <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> issue but staff are unwilling or unable to discuss the topic. Originality/value To our knowledge this is the first article that draws on the available literature to explore the known and likely implications of psychotropic induced sexual dysfunction for this client group...|$|E
