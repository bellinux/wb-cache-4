5|$|Descartes {{rejects the}} teleological, or purposive, {{view of the}} {{material}} world that was dominant in the West {{from the time of}} Aristotle. The mind is not viewed by Descartes as part of the material world, and hence is not subject to the strictly mechanical laws of nature. Motion and rest, on the other hand, are properties of the interactions of matter according to eternally fixed mechanical laws. God only sets the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> motion at the start, and later does not interfere except to maintain the dynamical regularities of the mechanical behavior of bodies. Hence there is no real teleology in the movements of bodies since the whole thing reduces to the law-governed collisions and their constant reconfigurations. The conatus is just the tendency of bodies to move when they collide with each other. God may set this activity in motion, but thereafter no new motion or rest can be created or destroyed.|$|E

500|$|In these series, Van Gogh was not preoccupied by {{his usual}} {{interest}} in filling his paintings with subjectivity and emotion; rather the two series {{are intended to}} display his technical skill and working methods to Gauguin, {{who was about to}} visit. The 1888 paintings were created during a rare period of optimism for the artist. Vincent wrote to Theo in August 1888, [...] "I'm painting with the gusto of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which won't surprise you when it's a question of painting large sunflowers... If I carry out this plan there'll be a dozen or so panels. The whole thing will therefore be a symphony in blue and yellow. I work on it all these mornings, from sunrise. Because the flowers wilt quickly and it's a matter of doing the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> one go." ...|$|E

500|$|Based {{upon their}} findings, {{and despite the}} expense and their {{intention}} to air [...] "Snuffy's Parents Get a Divorce" [...] in April 1992, the CTW decided not to risk possibly harming their audience and not air the episode. McGrath said,"They wrote a whole show and taped it, {{and it was just}} devastating for test groups of kids. So they just threw the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> the garbage and never tried it again. It was just too difficult a concept for a 3-year-old". CTW Research director Valeria Lovelace recommended scrapping the episode and going [...] "back to the drawing board", and the idea was abandoned, at least for the season. Producer Michael Loman recalled, [...] "We ate the cost and never aired it. We feel there are a range of issues that we can deal with in the family that do not go to the extreme of divorce". According to Sesame Street researcher Susan Scheiner, {{it was the first time}} the CTW had produced an episode, and after making a large investment, found after tests that the episode did not work. Rosemarie T. Truglio and her colleagues at the CTW cited the episode as an example of the CTW's practice of [...] "listening to the voices of children and by putting their needs first".|$|E
500|$|The last parody {{recorded}} for {{the album was}} [...] "Lasagna", a parody of the traditional folk song [...] "La Bamba". The song is mainly about Italian culture with a heavy emphasis on cuisine. When Yankovic began writing the song, he originally {{wanted it to be}} sung in Italian. He later said, [...] "I was actually going through Italian phrase books and dictionaries until I realized that the humor would be lost on 99% of the audience, so I decided to do the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> English but with kind of a bad Italian accent." [...] When the song was released as a single, it did not have a music video. However, ten years later in 1997 a short video was made for The Weird Al Show. Under U.S. law, Yankovic can parody any song he wants as long as he pays royalties to use the original music. However, as a personal rule, he asks for permission anyway in order to maintain good relations with the industry. This particular song is an exception to that rule. Although the song is a parody of the Los Lobos cover version, [...] "Lasagna" [...] marked Yankovic's first parody that did not require either permission from an artist or a payment of royalties, since the song [...] "La Bamba" [...] is a traditional folk song that is not attributed to any specific writer. Thus, Yankovic is the only writer given credit in the liner notes.|$|E
500|$|Unfortunately, {{their journey}} {{does not pay}} off well. The {{customer}} is revealed to be Tom (a recurring character throughout the series), who is at first happy that he finally got his pizza, until he discovers {{he did not get}} the drink he claims to have asked for. A confused SpongeBob checks the order, which says that Tom didn't order a drink (although it is heavily implied that Mr. Krabs didn't hear Tom's order correctly or that he hung up before Tom had a chance to finish). His blood boiling with anger, Tom harshly berates SpongeBob and refuses to take the pizza or pay for it before slamming the door. SpongeBob goes back to Squidward and collapses to the ground and cries (while absorbing his tears). Infuriated that Tom berated SpongeBob and won't pay for the pizza all because of a missing drink (making the long journey and the ridiculous obstacles the duo went through a complete waste of time), Squidward confronts Tom who arrogantly says, [...] "Another one? Look, I told your little friend I ain't payin' for that!" [...] to which Squidward angrily claims, [...] "Well, this one's on the house!" [...] and brutally shoves the pizza into Tom's face as payback for his rudeness. Squidward then goes back to SpongeBob who, stilling crying, asks, [...] "Did he change his mind?" [...] Squidward cheers him up by saying, [...] "He sure did. Ate the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> one bite." [...] The two then drive back to the Krusty Krab, which is comically revealed to be right across the street, much to Squidward's dismay, who then says [...] "Oh, my aching tentacles!".|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of The Incredible Hulk, Gale Anne Hurd commented on the {{uncertainty}} of its relationship with Ang Lee's Hulk film. [...] "We couldn't quite figure out how to term this ... It's kind of a reboot and it's kind of sequel." [...] Hurd said that [...] "requel", a portmanteau of [...] "reboot" [...] and [...] "sequel", was a [...] "perfect" [...] description for the film. Norton explained his decision to ignore Lee's origin story: [...] "I don't even like the phrase 'origin story', and I don't think in great literature and great films that explaining the roots of the story doesn't mean it comes in the beginning." [...] "Audiences know this story," [...] he added, [...] " [...] deal with it artfully." [...] He wanted to [...] "have revelations even in the third act about what set this <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> motion". The new origin story references Ultimate Marvel's take on the Hulk, which also had him created in an attempt to make super soldiers. Norton removed Rick Jones and toned down S.H.I.E.L.D.'s presence. He also added the scene where Banner attempts to extract a cure from a flower and his e-mailing with Samuel Sterns, which references Bruce Jones' story. Norton rewrote scenes every day. Ultimately, the Writers Guild of America decided to credit the script solely to Penn, who argued Norton had not dramatically changed his script. Journalist Anne Thompson explained [...] "The Guild tends to favor plot, structure and pre-existing characters over dialogue." [...] Penn said in 2008, [...] "I wasn't happy with [...] coming to Comic-Con saying that he wrote the script." [...] Before either Penn and Norton joined the project, an anonymous screenwriter wrote a draft and lobbied for credit.|$|E
500|$|The one reel drama, {{approximately}} 1000 feet long, {{was released}} on July 26, 1910. The release of the film fell on the same date of Vitagraph's Uncle Tom's Cabin. Vitagraph had previously released multi-reel works, but a three reel drama was considered a bold innovation by The New York Dramatic Mirror. The Mirror article stated the multi-reel release was risky because Pathé's two reel adaptation of Drink was not followed by other two reel releases. The sudden competition prompted Thanhouser to advertise against Vitagraph's production in The Moving Picture World by declaring the three reel film as being overly drawn out and that audiences could get the full story in a single reel from Thanhouser. Edward Wagenknecht, author of The Movies in the Age of Innocence, refers to Thanhouser advertising against a two reel version with, [...] "You can see the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> one reel - why buy two?" [...] This is actually an erroneous reference to the three reel Vitagraph version by Edwin Thanhouser that was published in The Moving Picture World on March 10, 1917. [...] H. Philip Bolton, author of Women Writers Dramatized: A Calendar of Performances from Narrative Works Published in English to 1900, would identify the Thanhouser and Vitagraph release, but is unable to identify and attribute the directorial and casting credits to the productions. A third 1910 adaptation, also named Uncle Tom's Cabin, release by Pathé is cited in The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film. According to Bowers, most Thanhouser posters of this era were of one-sheet size, but an additional six-sheet format poster was created for Uncle Tom's Cabin. The film likely had a wide national release, but specific identification of the Thanhouser film is muddied by the prevalence of Vitagraph's production and stage plays. Two advertisements in Indiana and Kansas specifically note that the film to be shown will be the Thanhouser production.|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety said, [...] "what seemed, in theory, the least-necessary {{revival of}} a big screen superhero emerges as {{perfectly}} solid summer action fare in The Incredible Hulk." [...] He emphasized [...] "it's all par-for-the-course cinematic demolition and destruction, staged efficiently and {{with a hint of}} enthusiasm," [...] and [...] "penned with sporadic wit [...] Visuals lean toward the dark and murky, but editing by three—actually six—hands is fleet, and Craig Armstrong's ever-present score is simultaneously bombastic and helpfully supportive of the action. Effects are in line with pic's generally pro but not inspired achievements." [...] Rene Rodriguez of The Miami Herald applauded that the film [...] "does a lot of things [...] Lee's Hulk didn't: It's lighter and faster-paced, it's funnier and it embraces (instead of ignoring) the 1970s TV series that furthered the character's popularity". Mark Rahner of The Seattle Times wrote that, [...] "The relaunch of Marvel's green goliath is an improvement over director Ang Lee's ponderous 2003 Hulk in nearly every way – except that the actual Hulk still looks scarcely better than something from a video game, and he still barely talks". Lou Lumenick of the New York Post said, [...] "What lingers in my memory ... is the lengthy, essentially animated climactic battle between the Hulk and the Abomination on the streets and rooftops of Harlem, and an earlier showdown between the title creature and the U.S. Army, which is deploying high-tech weapons including sound-wave cannons. These are expertly staged by director Louis Leterrier, who disposes of the backstory under the opening credits and wraps up the <b>whole</b> <b>thing</b> <b>in</b> twenty-four minutes less than [...] Lee took". Roger Ebert was not a fan of the film stating, [...] "The Incredible Hulk is no doubt an ideal version of the Hulk saga for those who found Ang Lee's Hulk too talky, or dare I say, too thoughtful. But not for me. It sidesteps the intriguing aspects of Hulkdom and spends way too much time in, dare I say, noisy and mindless action sequences." ...|$|E
