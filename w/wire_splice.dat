50|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{telegraph}} linemen developed methods {{of making a}} <b>wire</b> <b>splice</b> that would be strong mechanically and also carry electricity. The Western Union splice was the strongest of such wire-wrapped splices. The wraps could be coated in solder for even greater strength and to prevent oxidation between the wires.|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is aimed at developing a very comprehensive system of manufacturing wire splices for automobile wire harnesses. Ultrasonic welding is increasingly being used in various industrial applications. Lack of a scientific data-base of its properties when applied to wire splicing is {{a major reason for}} lack of proper usage by the wiring harness industry and its subsequent acceptance by the end user. This thesis presents various experiments conducted to develop tensile strengths and electrical resistances of various types of ultrasonically welded wire splices. Crimping technology was evaluated for its mechanical strengths and electrical properties by conducting various experiments {{to make it possible for}} the industry to compare it with other alternative splicing technologies. The results are then compared with ultrasonic welding. The next stage of this thesis discusses the economic feasibility of ultrasonic wire splicing. In order to find the number of ultrasonic welding machines required to meet a particular level of demand, which is a prerequisite for establishing the economic feasibility, a virtual model of the process and the manufacturing cell has been prepared and this model was used to study the dynamics of demand and the number of required machines. Simulation in manufacturing-problem-solving is being used very widely by researchers. Proper understanding and visualisation of the future of the factory and understanding and answering various questions related to the adoption of new technology, is another major reason why companies shy away from adopting ultrasonic welding systems. An advanced simulation tool namely QUEST was used to model the <b>wire</b> <b>splice</b> manufacturing cell of Alcatel and simulation studies were conducted to foresee how the production dynamics would be if ultrasonic welding machines were incorporated in place of crimping machines and various what if scenarios were developed and some vital production related questions were answered. Material handling is a major bottleneck in any wiring harness manufacturing environment. Some conceptual designs are presented on automating the task of feeding wires to ultrasonic welding machines and transferring the wire assemblies from welding stations to different work stations, currently being done manually. A wire palletising system was designed to improve the productivity. This thesis concludes that ultrasonic welding could be very effectively used for wire splicing and could be safely used in the manufacture of wiring harnesses for the automobile industry...|$|E

50|$|They fulfill {{numerous}} uses, including {{allowing the}} wires {{to be easily}} terminated to screw terminals, fast-on / quick-disconnect / spade-foot type terminals, <b>wire</b> <b>splices,</b> or various combinations of these. A tube-shaped connector with two crimps for <b>splicing</b> <b>wires</b> in-line is called a butt splice connector. Crimp-on connectors are attached by inserting the stripped end of a stranded wire into {{a portion of the}} connector, which is then mechanically deformed / compressed (crimped) tightly around the wire. The crimping is accomplished with special crimping pliers. A key idea behind crimped connectors is that the finished connection is gas-tight.|$|R
40|$|This slide {{presentation}} {{reviews the}} considerations {{for the design}} of wiring for the Lunar Module. Included are a review of the choice of conductors and insulations, the <b>wire</b> <b>splicing</b> (i. e., crimping, and soldering), the wire connectors, and the fabrication of the wire harnesses. The problems in fabrication include the wires being the wrong length, the damage due to the sharp edges, the requried use of temproary protective covers and inadequate training. The problems in the wire harness installation include damge from sharp eges, work on adjacent harnesses, connector damage, and breaking wires. Engineering suggestions from the Apollo-era in reference to the conductors that are reviewed include: the use of plated conductors, and the use of alloys for stronger wiring. In refernce to insulation, the suggestions from Apollo era include the use of polymer tape-wrap wire insulation due to the light weight, however, other types of modern insulation might be more cost-effective. In reference to <b>wire</b> <b>splices</b> and terminal boards the suggestions from the Apollo Era include the use of crimp splices as superior to solder <b>splices,</b> joining multiple <b>wire</b> to a common point using modular plug-ins might be more reliable, but are heavier than crimp splicing. For connectors, the lessons from the Apollo era indicate that a rear environmental seal that does not require additional potting is preferred, and pins should be crimped or welded to the incoming wires and be removable {{from the rear of the}} connector...|$|R

50|$|Knob-and-tube wiring (sometimes {{abbreviated}} K&T) is {{an early}} standardized method of electrical wiring in buildings, in common use in North America from about 1880 to the 1930s. It consisted of single-insulated copper conductors run within wall or ceiling cavities, passing through joist and stud drill-holes via protective porcelain insulating tubes, and supported along their length on nailed-down porcelain knob insulators. Where conductors entered a wiring device such as a lamp or switch, or were pulled into a wall, they were protected by flexible cloth insulating sleeving called loom. The first insulation was asphalt-saturated cotton cloth, then rubber became common. <b>Wire</b> <b>splices</b> in such installations were twisted together for good mechanical strength, then soldered and wrapped with rubber insulating tape and friction tape (asphalt saturated cloth), or made inside metal junction boxes.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} is {{an apparatus}} and method for <b>wire</b> <b>splicing</b> using an explosive joining process. The apparatus {{consists of a}} prebend, U-shaped strap of metal that slides over prepositioned wires. A standoff means separates the wires from the strap before joining. An adhesive means holds two ribbon explosives in position centered over the U-shaped strap. A detonating means connects to the ribbon explosives. The process involves spreading strands of each wire to be joined into a flat plane. The process then requires alternating each strand in alignment to form a mesh-like arrangement with an overlapped area. The strap slides over the strands of the wires. and the standoff means is positioned between the two surfaces. The detonating means then initiates the ribbon explosives that drive the strap to accomplish a high velocity. angular collision between the mating surfaces. This collision creates surface melts and collision bonding resulting in electron-sharing linkups...|$|R
2500|$|This {{particular}} DC-9 {{had experienced}} {{a number of problems}} over {{the months leading up to}} the incident; 76 maintenance reports had been filed in the plane's logs in the previous year, and the CVR records Cameron telling Ouimet to [...] "put [...] in the book there" [...] when the breakers fail to respond to the first reset attempt at 18:52. Nearly four years earlier, on 17 September 1979, the plane, then serving as Air Canada Flight 680 (Boston, Massachusetts, to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia), had suffered an explosive decompression in the rear bulkhead that required rebuilding the tail section and replacing or splicing most of the wiring and hydraulic lines in the back of the plane; Cameron later noted that the Air Canada maintenance crew [...] "did a heck of a job getting everything put back together" [...] after the decompression incident. Investigators were unable to find signs of arcing in any of the <b>wire</b> <b>splices</b> from the repairs done four years earlier, though much of the wiring in the rear of the plane was severely damaged or destroyed by the fire itself.|$|R
60|$|Eighteen {{years have}} passed since I last set foot in the London Sailors' Home. I was not staying there then; I had gone in {{to try to find a}} man I wanted to see. He was one of those able seamen who, in a watch, are a perfect blessing to a young officer. I could perhaps {{remember}} here and there among the shadows of my sea-life a more daring man, or a more agile man, or a man more expert in some special branch of his calling--such as <b>wire</b> <b>splicing,</b> for instance; but for all-round competence, he was unequalled. As character he was sterling stuff. His name was Anderson. He had a fine, quiet face, kindly eyes, and a voice which matched that something attractive in the whole man. Though he looked yet in the prime of life, shoulders, chest, limbs untouched by decay, and though his hair and moustache were only iron-grey, he was on board ship generally called Old Andy by his fellows. He accepted the name with some complacency.|$|R

40|$|Usage of the Internet {{is growing}} at a rapid pace. This growing {{popularity}} has {{had an impact on}} the content available over the Internet. Today, many bandwidth hungry applications are available to end users: music files, streaming audi 0 jvideo, and video conferencing. To be of practical use, larger bandwidth applications require higher speed Internet connections to the consumer. One method of providing high speed Internet access to a home or small business is through twisted pair telephone cables. Use of twisted pair to provide high speed Internet service is not without its problems. Many loop impairments exist that hinder high speed service, or prevent it altogether. Purposely placed impairments include loading coils and bridged taps. Unintentional impairments include <b>wire</b> <b>splices</b> and water in the cable casings. The locations of these impairments help the telephone companies (telco's) determine which lines have potential problems in delivering Internet access. A new technique called frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) has been proposed to locate these loop impairments. This thesis focuses on proving the viability of using FDR to accurately detect loop impairments. A physical device was designed and constructed to use the FDR technique. The device was tested on various telephone loop configurations. The device was also compared with a commercially available product. The results of the testing indicate FDR is a viable alternative fqr locating loop impairments. It performs at least as well as commercially available products...|$|R
50|$|A {{rat-tail}} splice, {{also known}} as a twist splice or a pig-tail splice, is a very basic electrical splice that can be done with both solid and stranded wire. It is made by taking two or more bare wires of the same diameter and wrapping them together symmetrically around the common axis of both <b>wires.</b> The bare <b>splice</b> can be insulated with electrical tape or other means.|$|R

50|$|A {{public inquiry}} {{was held in}} Aberdeen by the Board of Trade. This was the first such inquiry held in Scotland and was chaired by Captain Harris of the Royal Navy. It was well {{attended}} {{by members of the}} public. Witnesses reported that the river was flowing very fast, and that the wire-boat was more at risk than those being rowed across the water. The matter of overcrowding was also felt to be significant, but the poorly <b>spliced</b> <b>wire</b> was perhaps ultimately to blame.|$|R
25|$|For higher-powered lights, an {{external}} battery pack of 12V VRLA battery is often required. These battery packs usually strap {{to the top}} tube of the frame, or come in the shape that fits in a water bottle cage, or can {{be placed in a}} basket. A cable connects the battery pack to the light. Another advantage with battery power (especially with 12 volt) is the ability to power other components outside of lighting, as well as all from one battery (as long as they run safe on 12 volts) though <b>wire</b> spaghetti from <b>splicing</b> can be a setback depending on how complicated the electric system is.|$|R
50|$|Terminal blocks (also called {{terminal}} boards or strips) provide a convenient means of connecting individual electrical <b>wires</b> without a <b>splice</b> or physically joining the ends. They are usually used to connect wiring among various items of equipment within an enclosure {{or to make}} connections among individually enclosed items. Since terminal blocks are readily available {{for a wide range}} of wire sizes and terminal quantity, they are one of the most flexible types of electrical connector available. Some disadvantages are that connecting wires is more difficult than simply plugging in a cable and the terminals are generally not very well protected from contact with persons or foreign conducting materials.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFor some applications, short unit {{lengths of}} HTS <b>wires</b> should be <b>spliced</b> if longer lengths are {{necessary}} and short unit lengths of HTS wires should be utilize {{by applying the}} splice technology to reduce the total wire cost in the application. The splice technology has been developed for DI-BSCCO Type HT-CA tapes by Sumitomo Electric and spliced tapes were tested in Russian Cable Institute. The test program included: measurements of splice's resistance, critical current anisotropy, thermo cycling tolerance, mechanical properties, overload tests and magnetization measurements. In the paper the results of tests are presented and discussed. The test results demonstrated that splices {{can be used for}} cable production if twisting and bending limitations are taken into account...|$|R

40|$|A {{computerized}} interactive harness engineering {{program has}} been developed to provide an inexpensive, interactive system which is designed for learning and using an engineering approach to interconnection systems. PCACE is basically a database system that stores information as files of individual connectors and handles wiring information in circuit groups stored as records. This directly emulates the typical manual engineering methods of data handling, thus making the user interface to the program very natural. Data files can be created, viewed, manipulated, or printed in real time. The printed ouput is in a form ready for use by fabrication and engineering personnel. PCACE also contains {{a wide variety of}} error-checking routines including connector contact checks during hardcopy generation. The user may edit existing harness data files or create new files. In creating a new file, the user is given the opportunity to insert all the connector and harness boiler plate data which would be part of a normal connector wiring diagram. This data includes the following: 1) connector reference designator, 2) connector part number, 3) backshell part number, 4) cable reference designator, 5) cable part number, 6) drawing revision, 7) relevant notes, 8) standard wire gauge, and 9) maximum circuit count. Any item except the maximum circuit count may be left blank, and any item may be changed at a later time. Once a file is created and organized, the user is directed to the main menu and has access to the file boiler plate, the circuit wiring records, and the wiring records index list. The organization of a file is such that record zero contains the connector/cable boiler plate, and all other records contain circuit wiring data. Each wiring record will handle a circuit with as many as nine wires in the interface. The record stores the circuit name and wire count and the following data for each wire: 1) wire identifier, 2) contact, 3) <b>splice,</b> 4) <b>wire</b> gauge if different from standard, 5) wire/group type, 6) wire destination, and 7) note number. The PCACE record structure allows {{for a wide variety of}} <b>wiring</b> forms using <b>splices</b> and shields, yet retains sufficient structure to maintain ease of use. PCACE is written in TURBO Pascal 3. 0 and has been implemented on IBM PC, XT, and AT systems under DOS 3. 1 with a memory of 512 K of 8 bit bytes, two floppy disk drives, an RGB monitor, and a printer with ASCII control characters. PCACE was originally developed in 1983, and the IBM version was released in 1986...|$|R
