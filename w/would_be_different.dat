5|$|During the {{two weeks}} leading up to the Grand Prix, Räikkönen and Felipe Massa {{released}} statements to the press saying they believed that everything <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> in Canada because of the very different conditions—as shown at Paul Ricard. Fernando Alonso believed McLaren had momentum from their win in Monaco, and Martin Whitmarsh said that they were realistic about dominating the race.|$|E
5|$|In {{regards to}} the English dub, Shinkai {{did not feel that}} he could judge the quality of the voice acting since he could not speak English natively. He felt that it was good due to the {{feedback}} he had received and because he could feel the emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the experience <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of preserved soft tissue remains and DNA of woolly mammoths {{has led to}} the idea that the species could be recreated by scientific means. Several methods have been proposed to achieve this. Cloning would involve removal of the DNA-containing nucleus of the egg cell of a female elephant, and replacement with a nucleus from woolly mammoth tissue. The cell would then be stimulated into dividing, and implanted on a female elephant. The resulting calf would have the genes of the woolly mammoth, although its fetal environment <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>different.</b> Most intact mammoths have had little usable DNA because of their conditions of preservation. There is not enough to guide the production of an embryo.|$|E

5|$|The film marked {{something}} of an {{end of an era}} for its creator. The director himself recognized this {{at the time of its}} release, telling critic Donald Richie that a cycle of some kind had just come to an end and that his future films and production methods <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>different.</b> His prediction proved quite accurate. Beginning in the late 1950s, television began increasingly to dominate the leisure time of the formerly large and loyal Japanese cinema audience. And as film company revenues dropped, so did their appetite for risk—particularly the risk represented by Kurosawa's costly production methods.|$|E
5|$|The {{rules of}} the story stress that time cannot be changed through {{traveller}} actions as per the Novikov self-consistency principle; Paul Serene gives an example of trying to save a dead vagrant he and Jack discovered in their youth, only to startle the vagrant and cause the fall that killed him when he goes back in time. Another enforced rule is that travelers can only move between machines located at different times using the same core: as such, {{it is impossible for}} the characters to travel back before the first power-up of the core, nor would they be able to travel between different time machines as the cores <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>different.</b> The game features narration from Jack himself.|$|E
5|$|Gierek, like Gomułka in 1956, came {{to power}} on a raft of {{promises}} that everything <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> from now on: wages would rise, prices would remain stable, there would be freedom of speech, and {{those responsible for the}} violence at Gdynia and elsewhere would be punished. Although Poles were much more skeptical than they had been in 1956, Gierek was believed to be an honest and well-intentioned man, and his promises bought him some time. He used this time to create a new economic program, one based on large-scale borrowing from banks in the West — mainly from the United States and West Germany — to buy technology that would upgrade Poland's production of export goods. This massive borrowing, estimated to have totaled over 24 billion US (1970s) dollars during Gierek's years, was used to re-equip and modernize Polish industry, and to import consumer goods to give the workers more incentive to work.|$|E

5|$|Tekken series {{producer}} Katsuhiro Harada teased {{an announcement}} on his Twitter feed on September 17, 2010 ("TGS Sep 18(Sat) at Tougeki Booth. I'll announce something :D"). It {{was rumored to}} be something related to Tekken X Street Fighter or Tekken 7. The game was announced to be Tekken Tag Tournament 2, sequel to Tekken Tag Tournament, on September 18, 2010 at the Tougeki event as promised. Producer Katsuhiro Harada stated that the game engine <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> from the one used in Tekken 6. The release of the arcade version {{of the game in}} Japan was originally planned for summer 2011, but due to complications derived from the Great East Japan earthquake, the arcade release was postponed until Autumn 2011. At the World Cyber Games 2010, Harada stated that the console version would feature additional console-exclusive returning characters and bonus gameplay modes. He also suggested that the release of the console version of the game would take place between the releases of Street Fighter X Tekken and Tekken X Street Fighter.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} and co-written by Hironobu Sakaguchi, the original creator of Final Fantasy, {{who had the}} initial idea for the title after seeing the mixed responses to Blue Dragon and Lost Odyssey. Together with designer Takuya Matsumoto, Sakaguchi {{decided to make a}} game that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> from his previous work and most other role-playing games. Development took between three and four years according to different sources. Its story was originally based in science fiction, but at Nintendo's insistence it was changed to be primarily based around fantasy. Among the staff were regular Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, and illustrator Kimihiko Fujisaka. It was originally going to be exclusive to Japan, and later its North American release was in doubt after being announced for release in Europe and Australia. During this time, a fan campaign called Operation Rainfall drew considerable attention to the title. The title was a commercial success, and received generally positive reviews worldwide: while the gameplay generally met with praise, opinions varied on the story and graphics.|$|E
25|$|In this translation, samudhaya {{means that}} the uneasiness that's {{inherent}} to life arises together with the craving that life's event <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>different.</b> The translation of nirodha as confinement means that this craving is a natural reaction, which cannot be totally escaped or ceased, but can be limited, which gives us freedom.|$|E

50|$|Mystory is {{the name}} of a new {{pedagogical}} genre created by Ulmer in his book Teletheory. It was a response to a suggestion by Hayden White that if the concept of history had been invented in the twentieth century rather than the nineteenth, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> quite <b>different.</b> The idea <b>was</b> that if people had begun serious study of the past in the twentieth century rather than the nineteenth, the result <b>would</b> <b>be</b> quite <b>different</b> from what it is today.|$|R
25|$|Additionally, Cold 187um {{felt that}} in order to sign with Psychopathic, he had to create {{material}} that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> from what he produced for his own label, West World Records. During the tour, Cold 187um and Violent J created the character of a hired killer, and developed the concept of the album as a long-form story. After the tour, it was officially announced that Cold 187um had signed with Psychopathic.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the giant}} impact {{model has been}} criticised for being too explanatory; it can be {{expanded}} to explain any future discoveries and as such, is unfalsifiable. Also, many claim {{that much of the}} material from the impactor would have ended up in the Moon, meaning that the isotope levels <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>different,</b> but they are not. Also, while some volatile compounds such as water are absent from the Moon's crust, many others, such as manganese, are not.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the many}} Defender {{projects}} were several studies {{based on the}} concept that a re-entering nuclear warhead would cause unique physical signatures while still in the upper atmosphere. It was known that hot, high-speed objects caused ionization of the atmosphere that reflects radar waves, and it appeared that a warhead's signature <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> enough from decoys that a detector could pick out the warhead directly, or alternately, provide added information that would allow operators to focus a conventional tracking radar on the single return from the warhead.|$|E

25|$|Genealogists {{have also}} disputed Haley's {{research}} and conclusions in Roots. The Gambian griot {{turned out not}} to be a real griot, and the story of Kunta Kinte appears to have been a case of circular reporting, in which Haley's own words were repeated back to him. None of the written records in Virginia and North Carolina line up with the Roots story until after the Civil War. Some elements of Haley's family story can be found in the written records, but the most likely genealogy <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> from the one described in Roots.|$|E
25|$|During the off-season, English {{attended}} Boston University {{evenings and}} Saturdays to attain her degree. But combining baseball with {{going to college}} nights took her nine years to graduate. Nevertheless, playing professional baseball did help to pay her college expenses. Before the 1951 season, when the team moved from Racine, Wisconsin to Battle Creek, Michigan, English and some original Belles members were disappointment and decided {{not to make the}} move. During eight years, the Belles were a close-knit team, always like a family away from home. English and teammates thought that all <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>different,</b> like a new team, maybe a new manager and, specially, a new location.|$|E
25|$|Although both major trait {{models are}} descriptive, only the three-factor model offers a {{detailed}} causal explanation. Eysenck suggests that different personality traits {{are caused by}} {{the properties of the}} brain, which themselves are the result of genetic factors. In particular, the three-factor model identifies the reticular system and the limbic system in the brain as key components that mediate cortical arousal and emotional responses respectively. Eysenck advocates that extraverts have low levels of cortical arousal and introverts have high levels, leading extraverts to seek out more stimulation from socializing and being venturesome. Moreover, Eysenck surmised that there would be an optimal level of arousal, after which inhibition would occur and that this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> for each person.|$|E

Amuro first revealed in the March 2009 issue of S Kawaii that she was preparing a new album which she would begin recording during her Best Fiction Tour. In the interview, she also confirmed that {{the direction of the}} album <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> from her previous album. Confirmation of the impending release of Amuro's ninth studio album occurred several months later when media outlets began to report new commercials with new songs by the singer would appear not in a new single, but a new album {{towards the end of the}} year.|$|E
25|$|Similar in {{use to the}} grimoires of {{ceremonial}} magicians, the Book contained {{instructions for}} how to perform rituals and spells, as well as religious poetry and chants like Eko Eko Azarak to use in those rituals. Gardner's original intention was that every copy of the Book <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>different,</b> because a student would copy from their initiators, but changing things which they felt to be personally ineffective, however amongst many Gardnerian Witches today, particularly in the United States, all copies of the Book are kept identical to the version that the High Priestess Monique Wilson copied from Gardner, with nothing being altered. The Book of Shadows was originally meant to be kept a secret from non-initiates into BTW, but parts of the Book have been published by authors including Charles Cardell, Lady Sheba, Janet Farrar and Stewart Farrar.|$|E
25|$|Jenkens, Gaw and Phillips then {{met with}} a faculty {{committee}} to seek official recognition for their new fraternity. The faculty members were reluctant to recognize a sixth fraternity in a school with only 300 students, especially as {{more than half the}} members would be soon-to graduate seniors. Additionally, another national fraternity already existed using the name Sigma Phi. The founders responded that their new fraternity <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>different</b> from the others at Richmond, as was being founded upon biblical, egalitarian principles, and new members would quickly be taken in from the undergraduate classes to increase the new fraternity's size, and the fraternity's name was still open to debate. With these assurances from the founders, the faculty committee approved the new fraternity's request for official recognition. Shortly afterwards, the founders met and decided to rename the fraternity Sigma Phi Epsilon.|$|E
