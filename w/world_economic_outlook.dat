40|$|The {{cyclical}} upswing in Austria continues. Driven by the swift expansion of global activity, exports are posting strong gains. Meanwhile, the momentum {{is being transmitted}} to private investment which is set to rise substantially over the forecast period. Short-term indicators suggest that the positive trend will persist {{in the first half}} of 2011 before moderating somewhat in parallel with developments abroad, under the impact of rising commodity and energy prices and a more restrictive policy stance in both the industrialised and the emerging economies. Further ahead, demand and output growth is set to regain momentum. For Austria, WIFO expects GDP to increase by 2. 5 percent in 2011 and 2. 0 percent in 2012. The major risk for the upswing currently derive from the drift in commodity and energy prices which may have a substantial impact on the <b>world</b> economy. <b>Economic</b> <b>Outlook...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{repository}} item {{contains a}} working {{paper from the}} Boston University Global Economic Governance Initiative. The Global Economic Governance Initiative (GEGI) is a research program of the Center for Finance, Law & Policy, the Frederick S. Pardee Center for the Study of the Longer-Range Future, and the Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies. It was founded in 2008 to advance policy-relevant knowledge about governance for financial stability, human development, and the environment. During the 1980 s the IMF emerged as a global “bad cop,” demanding harsh austerity measures in countries faced with debt problems. Has the Great Recession changed all that? Is there more room {{to negotiate with the}} Fund on fiscal policy? The answer is yes. If we {{take a close look at}} what the IMF researchers say and what its most influential official reports proclaim, then we can see that there has been a more “Keynesian” turn at the Fund. This means that today one can find arguments for less austerity, more growth measures and a fairer social distribution of the burden of fiscal sustainability. The IMF has experience a major thaw of its fiscal policy doctrine and well‐informed member states can use this to their advantage. These changes do not amount to a paradigm shift, a la Paul Krugman’s ideas. Yet crisis‐ridden countries that are keen to avoid punishing austerity packages can exploit this doctrinal shift by exploring the policy implications of the IMF’s own official fiscal doctrine and staff research. They can cut less spending, shelter the most disadvantaged, tax more at the top of income distribution and think twice before rushing into a fast austerity package. This much is clear in all of the Fund’s <b>World</b> <b>Economic</b> <b>Outlooks</b> and Global Fiscal Monitors published between 2009 and 2013 with regard to four themes: the main goals of fiscal policy, the basic options for countries with fiscal/without fiscal space, the pace of fiscal consolidation, and the composition of fiscal stimulus and consolidation...|$|R

40|$|Newly {{available}} {{data show that}} officially recorded remittance flows to developing countries reached $ 338 billion in 2008, higher than our previous estimate of $ 328 billion. Based on monthly and quarterly data released by some central banks and {{in line with the}} <b>World</b> Bank’s global <b>economic</b> <b>outlook</b> we estimate that remittance flows to developing countries will fall to $ 317 billion in 2009. This 6. 1 percent decline is smaller than our earlier expectation of a 7. 3 percent fall. While new migration flows have fallen, existing migrants are not returning even though the job market has been weak in many destination countries. We maintain our expectation of a recovery in migration and remittance flows in 2010 and 2011, but the recovery is likely to be shallow. Remittance flows to South Asia grew strongly in 2008 despite the global economic crisis, but now there are risks that they may slow down in a lagged response to a weak global economy. East Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa also face similar risks. By contrast, remittance flows to Latin America and the Caribbean, and Middle East and North Africa have been weaker than expected in 2009; yet, they appear to have reached a bottom already, with the expectation of a recover...|$|R
