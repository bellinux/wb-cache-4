500|$|Ferguson remarked the Shield {{should not}} have been settled on penalties; to him it was a [...] "celebration of success", though {{ultimately}} he was delighted his team won. He was pleased with the team's start – [...] "I thought in the first 25 minutes we were really good and could have tied the match up then" [...] – and considered lining the team up in a 4–3–3 formation to begin with, though wanted to see [...] "how Keane played with Ince, what the balance was like". Ince believed he should have been awarded a penalty after Jensen fouled him: [...] "I was past their last man and there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> would have dived from there." ...|$|E

[...] Sky set a high pace in pursuit of the leading group, and with [...] to go, Chris Froome attacked, {{followed}} by Tejay van Garderen, and they soon passed the leaders. With [...] remaining, Froome attacked to win the stage by a margin of seventeen seconds. Van Garderen moved into the lead of the general classification, and although placing second in the stage, he was content, saying [...] "My tactic was just to mark Froome and when he went there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> could follow him, but I'm very happy with the yellow jersey." ...|$|E
500|$|Jaws set the {{template}} for many subsequent horror films, {{to the extent}} that the script for Ridley Scott's 1979 science fiction film Alien was pitched to studio executives as [...] "Jaws in space". Scott would later reveal in a 2017 interview that Jaws had made a lasting impression, [...] "I was always put off from swimming ever since I watched Jaws," [...] says Scott. [...] "I quite liked swimming, actually, and I'd occasionally dive, but once I saw Jaws there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> was ever going to learn to surf – no way!

500|$|In {{the final}} minute of play, with Phil Esposito, Yvan Cournoyer and Peter Mahovlich out on the ice, Paul Henderson stood up at the bench and called Mahovlich off the ice as he was skating by. [...] "I jumped {{on the ice and}} rushed {{straight}} for their net. I had this strange feeling that I could score the winning goal", recalls Henderson. Bobby Clarke was supposed to replace Esposito, but Phil didn't come off ("There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> was coming off the ice in that situation" [...] Esposito said). Cournoyer picked up a puck that had been passed around the boards by the Soviets in a clearing attempt. He missed Henderson with a pass, but two Soviets mishandled the puck in the corner and Esposito shot the puck on Tretiak.|$|E
2500|$|There was {{controversy}} in April when Graham Yallop released a (ghost written) {{book about the}} Ashes, Lambs to the Slaughter where he claimed Hogg ran [...] "roughshod" [...] over him during the English series. [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> tried to run roughshod over him", said Hogg. [...] "I simply didn't get any support at all for field placings in the early Tests {{and that is why}} we had continual disagreements". Yallop said he didn't actually write the book and wanted the Hogg chapter re-written. The book was released regardless.|$|E

[...] Ledley publicly defended himself, stating [...] "I couldn’t believe it when the ref sent me off. I thought it was a fair challenge", and added “I spoke to Ian [...] after it and even he told me I got the ball – there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> went in to intentionally hurt anyone."

2500|$|... "I did {{the pilot}} for Britain's Got Talent – which was {{originally}} {{going to be}} called Paul O'Grady's Got Talent. But I told the producers they were having a joke if they thought I would front a show with that title. The original panel of judges was going to be Simon Cowell, Fern Britton and Piers Morgan. I was the host. Then when I had the row with ITV I was banned from the studios. I remember I rang Simon and told him he had a huge hit on his hands, but there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> could do it. I said, if I am banned I have to be banned from everything.

2500|$|Dinosaur {{recorded}} much {{of their}} second album You're Living All Over Me with Sonic Youth engineer Wharton Tiers in New York. During the recording process, tension emerged between Mascis and Murph because Mascis had very specific ideas for the drum parts. Barlow recalled, [...] "J controlled Murph's every drumbeat...And Murph could not handle that. Murph wanted to kill J for the longest time." [...] Gerard Cosloy was excited by the completed album, but was devastated when Mascis told him the band was going to release it on California-based SST Records. Mascis was reluctant to sign a two-album deal with Homestead, but Cosloy felt betrayed, [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> couldn't take it personally." [...] After the album's completion Mascis moved to New York, leaving {{the rest of the}} band feeling alienated.|$|E
30|$|One father interviewed {{identified}} {{the question of}} gender {{as a source of}} difficulty: relations with the school are mostly undertaken by mothers and the teachers are for the most part women. This fact is closely connected to the question of school hours, often incompatible with work schedules: “I work from 5.30 to 18.00, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> can ever accompany my daughter to school, or pick her up” (Parent, school 3).|$|R

2500|$|Von Teese has {{appeared}} {{on a number of}} best-dressed lists and frequents the front row of fashion shows, particularly Christian Dior, Vivienne Westwood, Jean Paul Gaultier, and Marc Jacobs, labels she is often seen wearing. Speaking of her love of Gaultier, Von Teese has said, [...] "Jean Paul Gaultier, John Galliano, and Vivienne Westwood were the first designers that really made an impact on me. Jean Paul has {{a lot of the same}} obsessions that I do, like corsetry, ballet-peach satin and silks, black silk velvet, bullet bras and girdles. When I was a teenager, I would look for 1930s peach satin lingerie pieces to try to get his look for less, because there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> could afford his things back then. It was a dream come true to meet him and become friends with him. I met him the first time when I was doing my first fashion pictorial, which was for Flaunt magazine, and it was a huge story of me wearing the most important pieces from his haute couture archives, and that was a dream!" ...|$|E
2500|$|In late 1976, he {{auditioned for}} Iron Maiden, {{eager to get}} back into [...] "a more sort of heavy rock-type vibe." [...] at the time, the band already had two guitarists, Dave Sullivan and Terry Rance, who disapproved of Murray's admittance, seeing it as a slight on their ability. The group's founder and bassist Steve Harris did not {{hesitate}} in choosing Murray over Sullivan and Rance, stating, [...] "When the others made it plain that it was either them or Dave Murray, there was no choice. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> was gonna let Dave go. Not only was he a nice bloke, he was just the best guitarist I'd ever worked with. He still is." [...] Unfortunately, after only a few months in the band, Murray was sacked following an argument with then vocalist Dennis Wilcock after a show at the Bridgehouse pub in Canning Town which led him to team up with Adrian Smith again in his band, Urchin. During his short tenure with this group, Murray recorded one single, entitled [...] "She's A Roller", after which he was asked to rejoin Iron Maiden following Dennis Wilcock's departure.|$|E
2500|$|The damage {{occurred}} {{when she was}} flying a mission over Baghdad on April 7, 2003. [...] "We did our job with the guys there on the ground, and as {{we were on our}} way out is when I felt the jet get hit. It was pretty obvious — it was loud... I lost all hydraulics instantaneously, and the jet rolled left and pointed toward the ground, which was an uncomfortable feeling over Baghdad. It didn't respond to any of my control inputs." [...] She tried several procedures to get the aircraft under control, none of which worked; last, she put the plane into manual reversion, meaning she was flying the aircraft without hydraulics. The aircraft immediately responded. [...] "The jet started climbing away from the ground, which was a good feeling because there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> wanted to eject over Baghdad." [...] With some technical advice from her flight leader, Lieutenant Colonel Turner, she flew the injured plane for an hour back to the air base. [...] "The jet was performing exceptionally well. I had no doubt in my mind I was going to land that airplane." [...] Landing was tricky: [...] "When you lose all the hydraulics, you don't have speed brakes, you don't have brakes, and you don't have steering." ...|$|E
2500|$|Warwick {{has very}} outspoken {{opinions}} about the future, {{particularly with respect to}} artificial intelligence and its effect on the human species, and argues that humanity will need to use technology to enhance itself to avoid being overtaken by machines.

50|$|An {{important}} aspect of self-destructive behavior is the inability to handle the stress stemming from an individual's lack of self-confidence - for example in a relationship, whether the other person is truly faithful ("how can they love someone like me?"); at work or school, whether the realization of assignments and deadlines is possible ("there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> can complete all my work on time"). Self-destructive people usually lack healthier coping mechanisms, like asserting personal boundaries. As a result, they tend to feel that showing they are incompetent {{is the only way}} to untangle themselves from demands.|$|R
2500|$|In addition, Hart {{states in}} Hitman, that while conversing with Michaels: [...] "I added, 'I also {{want you to}} know that I have no problem {{dropping}} the belt to you if that's what Vince wants.' He glared back at me. 'I appreciate that, but I {{want you to know}} that I'm not willing to do the same for you.' And then he left. Jim [...] snorted, 'I can't believe that he just said that.' There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> could ever drop the belt to him now: he'd just shown complete disrespect not only to me, but to the position of champion..." [...] This exchange is confirmed in Dave Meltzer's account: [...] "During the meeting, Hart told Michaels that he'd be happy to put him over at the end of the run, but Michaels told Hart flat-out that he wouldn't return the favor. Michaels and Hart spoke again on the subject on 10/12 in San Jose, when once again Michaels told Hart that he wasn't going to do a job for him." [...] Additionally, in Forgiven Vince Russo stated, [...] "Well - no surprise here - Bret refused to do the job (get pinned) for Shawn in Canada. Not because he was being unprofessional - but because according to Bret, Michaels had said that he wouldn't do business with him (the right thing for the company in the ring), due to the way he felt about him." ...|$|E

Fortune favoured me, and we met in the woodland, and I saw that she was still beautiful and knew that I loved her more than ever before. I gave her choice to fly with me or to die, and after a while she died. But as she shrank up the wooded hillside before my sword, of a sudden she stood still and said: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to {{talk about}} Beatrice," [...] he declared. [...] "I want to tell you {{everything}} about her. I know that you will understand. We were brought up together in the same country place. We were both thrown upon the world about the same time. That was one thing, I suppose, which made us kindly disposed towards one another. We corresponded always. I commenced my unsuccessful fight in London. I lived--I can't tell you how--week by week, month by month. I ate coarse food, I was a hanger-on to the fringe of everything in life which appealed to me, fed intellectually on the crumbs of free libraries and picture galleries. I met no one of my own station--I was at a public school and my people were gentlefolk--or tastes. I had no friends in London before whom I dared present myself, no money to join a club where I might have mixed with my fellows, no one to talk to or exchange a single idea with--and I wasn't always the gloomy sort of person I have become; in my younger days I loved companionship. And the women--my landlady's daughter, with dyed hair, a loud voice, slatternly in the morning, a flagrant imitation of her less honest sisters at night! Who else? Where was I to meet women when I didn't even know men? I spent my poor holidays at Detton Magna. Our very loneliness brought Beatrice and me closer together. We used to walk in those ugly fields around Detton Magna and exchanged the story of our woes. She was a teacher at the national school. The children weren't pleasant, their parents were worse. The drudgery was horrible, and there wasn't any escape for her. Sometimes she would sob as we sat side by side. She, too, wanted something out of life, as I did, and there seemed nothing but that black wall always before us. I think that we clung together because we shared a common misery. We talked endlessly of a way out. For me what was there? There was no one to rob--I wasn't clever enough. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> could earn money, honestly or dishonestly. And for her, buried in that Derbyshire village amongst the collieries, where there was scarcely a person who hadn't the taint of the place upon them--what chance was there for her? There was nothing she could do, either. I knew in my heart that we were both ready for evil things, if by evil things we could make our escape. And we couldn't. So we tried to lose ourselves in the only fields left for such as we. We read poetry. We tried to live in that unnatural world where the brains only are nourished and the body languishes. It was a morbid, unhealthy existence, but I plodded along and so did she. Then her weekly letters became different. For the first time she wrote me with reserves. I took a day's vacation and I went down to Detton Magna to see what had happened." ...|$|E

We have 15,000 students in our seminaries. Every single one of our seminary presidents is a godly man who believes the Word and has a burden for souls.

She worked with Terry Johnson in four productions: Elton John’s Glasses (1997), The London Cuckolds (1998), The Graduate (2000) and Piano/Forte (2006). [...] Johnson wrote Piano/Forte for her and said, [...] "Kelly is possibly the most natural, dyed-in-the-wool, deep-in-the-bone actress I've ever worked with." [...] Reilly has stated that she learned the most as an actor from Karel Reisz, who directed her in The Yalta Game in Dublin in 2001. She said, [...] "He was my masterclass.

The closure of the base at Roosevelt Roads resulted in a substantial financial loss to the economy of Puerto Rico that the Navy estimates at $250 to $300 million a year. Admiral Robert J.
