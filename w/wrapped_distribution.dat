30|$|We {{introduce}} a new wrapped exponential distribution named transmuted wrapped exponential (TWE) distribution, for the modeling of circular datasets by using the Transmutation Rank-Map method. This method is employed {{for the first time}} for a <b>wrapped</b> <b>distribution</b> with this study. The introduced distribution is more flexible than traditional wrapped exponential distribution. The paper provides the explicit form of important distributional properties of the introduced distribution such as expectation, median, moments, characteristic function, quantile function, hazard rate function and stress-strength reliability. Rényi and Shannon entropies are also obtained. The statistical inference problem for the TWE distribution is investigated using maximum likelihood, least squares and weighted least squares and comparative numerical study results are presented. Furthermore, we present a real dataset analysis.|$|E
30|$|In this article, we have {{introduced}} a new transmuted <b>wrapped</b> <b>distribution</b> named TWE distribution, for modeling the circular data. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, the transmutation of a circular distribution is a new attempt to obtain more flexible circular distribution. In the paper, the pdf and the cdf of the introduced distribution are derived and their behaviors are illustrated. Rényi and Shannon entropies of the distribution are obtained in an open form. Furthermore, explicit forms of the basic characteristics of the introduced distribution such as mean, trigonometric moments, characteristic function, quantile function and others are obtained. To estimate the unknown parameters of the introduced distribution, the maximum likelihood, the least squares and the weighted least squares estimators are obtained. By a conducted Monte Carlo simulation study, the efficiencies of these estimators are comparatively illustrated. The results of the Monte Carlo simulation show that when the sample size increases, both Bias and MSE values decrease for all estimation methods. Finally, we apply the introduced distribution to a real-life dataset named turtles dataset. Using the log-likelihood, AIC and Watson’s statistic criteria, the modeling performance of the introduced distribution is compared with wrapped exponential distribution and wrapped Lindley distribution. According to the obtained results, we can say that the TWE distribution is a better model to the turtle data than WE and WL distributions.|$|E

40|$|Summary. Circular data {{arise in}} a number of {{different}} areas such as geological, meteorological, biological and industrial sciences. Standard statistical techniques can not be used to model circular data due to the circular geometry of the sample space. One of the common methods to analyze circular data is known as the wrapping approach. This approach is based on a simple fact that a probability distribution on a circle can be obtained by <b>wrapping</b> a probability <b>distribution</b> defined on the real line. A large class of probability distributions that are flexible to account for different features of circular data can be obtained by the aforementioned approach. However, the likelihood-based inference for <b>wrapped</b> <b>distributions</b> can be very complicated and computationally intensive. The EM algorithm to compute the MLE is feasible, but is computationally unsatisfactory. A data augmentation method using slice sampling is proposed to overcome such computational difficulties. The proposed method turns out to be flexible and computationally efficient to fit a wide class of <b>wrapped</b> <b>distributions.</b> In addition, a new model selection criteria for circular data is developed. Results from an extensive simulation study are presented to validate the performance of the proposed estimation method and the model selection criteria. Application to a real data set is also presented and parameter estimates are compared to those that are available in the literature...|$|R
