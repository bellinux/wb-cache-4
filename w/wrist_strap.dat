5|$|The Shenandoah {{destroyed}} {{one more}} prize in the Sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan, then continued to the Aleutians {{and into the}} Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean, crossing the Arctic Circle on June 19. Continuing then south {{along the coast of}} Alaska the Shenandoah came upon a fleet of Union ships whaling on June 22. She opened continuous fire, destroying a major portion of the Union whaling fleet. Capt. Waddell took aim at a fleeing whaler, Sophia Thornton, and at his signal, the gunner jerked a <b>wrist</b> <b>strap</b> and fired the last two shots of the American Civil War. Shenandoah had so far captured and burned eleven ships of the American whaling fleet while in Arctic waters.|$|E
5|$|The game uses {{both of the}} system's screens {{to offer}} new options. The top screen {{displays}} the normal gameplay, while the bottom touchscreen can function as an overhead map and touch controls. The overhead map displays the current course the player traverses and displays item locations. The touch controls include virtual buttons, which rotate the top screen's camera angle, and directional character controls, which can operate with either the DS stylus or the player's thumb using the DS <b>wrist</b> <b>strap.</b> In addition to the single-player adventure, the game includes 36 minigames and a multiplayer mode. Minigames are made accessible by catching rabbits in the main game. All minigames use the touchscreen to play, and are based on different themes: racing, card games, puzzles, and so forth. The multiplayer mode uses the wireless DS Download Play where up to four players compete against each other using Green, Red, Blue and Yellow Yoshi (voiced by Kazumi Totaka)—character hats appear in the stage allowing players to transform into either Mario, Luigi, or Wario. Wario can stun opponents by picking them up, swinging them, and throwing them.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Wrist</b> straps: <b>Wrist</b> <b>straps</b> (lifting straps) are {{sometimes}} used {{to assist in}} gripping very heavy weights. <b>Wrist</b> <b>straps</b> {{can be used to}} isolate muscle groups like in [...] "lat pull-downs", where the trainee would primarily use the latissimus dorsi muscles of the back rather than the biceps. They are particularly useful for the deadlift. Some lifters avoid using <b>wrist</b> <b>straps</b> to develop their grip strength, just as some go further by using thick bars. <b>Wrist</b> <b>straps</b> can allow a lifter initially to use more weight than {{they might be able to}} handle safely for an entire set, as unlike simply holding a weight, if it is dropped then the lifter must descend with it or be pulled down. Straps place stress on the bones of the wrist which can be potentially harmful if excessive.|$|R

25|$|Permanently {{attached}} gloves or mitts are unusual, It is {{more common}} {{for them to be}} connected by attachment rings. Either way, the absence of a wrist seal makes getting {{in and out of the}} suit much easier since there is no need for the suit to tightly seal around the wrists. It may be necessary to use a <b>wrist</b> <b>strap</b> to prevent loose gloves pulling off the hands when filled with air. Dry gloves can also be fitted over a wrist seal, which prevents leakage into the sleeves if the gloves are penetrated.|$|E
500|$|The Wii Remote is {{the primary}} {{controller}} for the console. It uses a combination of built-in accelerometers and infrared detection to sense its position in 3D space when pointed at the LEDs in the Sensor Bar. This design allows users to control the game with physical gestures as well as button-presses. The controller connects to the console using Bluetooth with an approximate [...] range, and features rumble and an internal speaker. [...] An attachable <b>wrist</b> <b>strap</b> {{can be used to}} prevent the player from unintentionally dropping (or throwing) the Wii Remote.
