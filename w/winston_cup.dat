5|$|For the 1987 season, Kulwicki secured primary {{sponsorship}} from Zerex Antifreeze {{and changed}} his car number to seven. He {{picked up his}} first career pole position in the season's third race, at Richmond. Later that season, he again qualified fastest at Richmond and Dover. Kulwicki came close to winning his first <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> race at Pocono, finishing second after winner Dale Earnhardt passed him on the last lap. With nine top10 finishes, eleven DNFs, and an average finish of 18.2 in 29events; Kulwicki finished 15th in the <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> points standings for the season.|$|E
5|$|Kulwicki {{had been}} {{selected}} {{to compete in the}} 1993 International Race of Champions (IROC) series as the reigning <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> champion. He competed in twoIROC races before his death, finishing ninth at Daytona and eleventh at Darlington. Dale Earnhardt raced for Kulwicki in the final twoIROC races, and the prize money for those races and their fifthplace combined points finish was given to the <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> Racing Wives Auxiliary, Brenner Children's Hospital and St. Thomas Aquinas Church charities.|$|E
5|$|The 1998 Pepsi 400 was {{the only}} <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> Series start by Dan Pardus, and the last by Billy Standridge. It was also the last race for which Rick Wilson {{attempted}} to qualify.|$|E
5|$|Contested over 160laps, {{it was the}} thirtieth race of the 1998 season. Jeff Gordon of Hendrick Motorsports {{took his}} {{eleventh}} win of the season, while Bobby Labonte finished second and Mike Skinner finished third. Gordon retained his point lead {{on the way to}} his third <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> championship title.|$|E
5|$|Kulwicki raced in fourNASCAR Busch Grand National Series (now Xfinity Series) {{races in}} 1984. At the time, the Busch Grand National Series was {{considered}} NASCAR's feeder circuit, a proving ground for drivers {{who wished to}} step up to the organization's premiere circuit, the <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup.</b> Kulwicki qualified second fastest and finished in second place at his first career NASCAR race, which took place at the Milwaukee Mile, several city blocks from where he grew up. Later that year, he finished seventh at Charlotte and fifth at Bristol. The following year, Kulwicki placed sixteenth in the season-opening Busch Series race at Daytona. Although he won the pole position at that year's event in Milwaukee, he finished fourteenth because of engine problems. Kulwicki's Busch Series successes caught car owner Bill Terry's eye and he offered Kulwicki a chance to race for him in several <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> events.|$|E
5|$|Gordon, who {{had entered}} the race with the points lead, {{extended}} it to 358 points over Mark Martin; nobody would challenge Gordon over {{the remainder of the}} season, and he would go on to win his third <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> Series championship; he was the youngest driver to accomplish the feat. The race took two hours, forty-six minutes, and two seconds to complete, and the margin of victory was 0.176 seconds.|$|E
5|$|He {{competed in}} 22 races (of 30) again in 1978, winning four times for a 16th-place {{finish in the}} season points. In March, Pearson won his 100th <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> race at Rockingham. Late in the World 600, Pearson was battling for the win against Parsons until Parsons' spin {{collected}} both drivers. Darrell Waltrip edged Donnie Allison for the victory. Pearson competed in his final IROC race in June 1978 during IROC V.|$|E
5|$|The 1998 Pepsi 400 was {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} run on July 4, 1998, as the seventeenth race of the 33-event <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> Series schedule. It was the first superspeedway race, and first NASCAR event held at Daytona, to be run at night following the installation of Musco lighting at the Daytona International Speedway; it was also scheduled to be broadcast live on CBS, the first stock car event to be televised live on primetime network television.|$|E
5|$|Practice {{and first}} round {{qualifying}} {{was held on}} Thursday, October 15, 1998; Bobby Labonte led pre-qualifying practice with a lap time of 46.722 seconds. Five Ford teams, those of drivers Chad Little, Jimmy Spencer, Rich Bickle, Dick Trickle and Billy Standridge, ran Thunderbird-bodied race cars, instead of the standard Taurus ran at most 1998 <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> Series races, believing the Thunderbird to have an aerodynamic advantage at the restrictor plate racetracks. Randal Ritter's car failed to pass inspection due to extreme irregularities in its construction, and the team withdrew before practice began.|$|E
5|$|Robinson {{returned}} to racing in 1999 in the ARCA Bondo/Mar-Hyde Series with car owner James Finch. At her debut {{race in the}} FirstPlus Financial 200 at Daytona International Speedway, she took a second-place finish, the best for a woman driver in the championship. Afterward, Robinson moved into a car owned by <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> Series driver Jeremy Mayfield, and finished fourth at Lowe's Motor Speedway. She qualified in eighth place at the final race of her year in Talladega Superspeedway but {{was involved in a}} crash after completing 66 laps and retired from the event. Robinson clinched the season's highest finishing rookie award.|$|E
5|$|The 1998 Pepsi 400 was a NASCAR <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> Series {{stock car}} race held on October 17, 1998, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. Originally {{scheduled}} to be held on the Fourth of July, the race was postponed until the fall due to widespread wildfires in central Florida; {{it was the first}} superspeedway race to be held at night, and the first time (and, as of 2017, the only time) there were two consecutive points-paying restrictor plate races, with the Winston 500 being run first on October 11.|$|E
5|$|There was one {{change of}} driver before the race. Jon Wood, the {{grandson}} of retired driver Glen Wood, was originally scheduled to replace 1988 NASCAR <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> Series champion Bill Elliott in the No. 21 Wood Brothers Racing car, but withdrew {{because of a lack}} of experience with the Car of Tomorrow, and former Haas CNC Racing driver Johnny Sauter took over his seat. Wood said he felt Sauter was a better qualifier and Elliott was not available to drive. Kahne developed a sinus infection two days before the event, and his team had Nationwide Series driver Jason Keller ready to replace him if he could not compete.|$|E
5|$|She {{moved to}} the Busch Series (now called Xfinity Series) in 1991 where she {{struggled}} to perform well but achieved one pole position in 1994. Robinson left a year later {{to start a family}} and began an interior decorating business. In 1999, she returned to active competition in the ARCA Bondo/Mar-Hyde Series where she ran strongly, and finished sixth in the series championship standings the following year. Robinson returned to NASCAR in 2001, and made her debut in the <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> Series (now the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series) but was unable to compete successfully. She retired from racing four years later to focus on her family and concentrate on running her interior design and furniture business.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Gordon is an American racing {{driver who}} drove in the NASCAR Cup Series {{full-time}} from 1993 to 2015, winning 93 Cup Series races and four Cup championships.

Gordon made his <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> debut in the season-ending race, the Hooters 500 at Atlanta, finishing 31st after a crash.|$|E
5|$|Ripken has {{received}} several tributes outside of baseball. On September 23, 2001, the NASCAR <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> series and MBNA renamed the fall race at Dover International Speedway in Dover, Delaware, naming the race the MBNA Cal Ripken Jr. 400. The race {{paid tribute to}} the legacy of Ripken, who was in attendance greeting the competing drivers as they crossed the stage during driver introductions. Driver Bobby Labonte had a special paint scheme on his #18 Interstate Batteries car featuring Baltimore Orioles colors along with Ripken's retirement seal. The race was won by Dale Earnhardt Jr., who was then driving the #8 car. The race {{was also the first}} race held after the September 11, 2001, attacks as the race scheduled for Loudon a week earlier had been postponed {{in the wake of the}} attacks. On March 30, 2008, I-395's eastern branch in Baltimore, from I-95 to Conway Street, was named Cal Ripken Way.|$|E
5|$|Robinson started {{competing}} in the NASCAR Busch Grand National Series (now Xfinity Series) in 1991, driving the No. 77 Huffman Racing Buick. At the time, the Busch Grand National Series was considered NASCAR's feeder circuit, a proving ground for drivers who wished {{to step up to}} the organization's premiere circuit, the <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup.</b> Early on, she struggled to find sponsorship and ran the season without a sponsor. Robinson qualified 26th fastest and finished 15th at her first Busch Series race, which took place at Orange County Speedway. Later that year, she finished 21st at Motor Mile Speedway, and 18th at the season's second race held at Orange County Speedway. The final race Robinson qualified for was at Charlotte Motor Speedway driving the No. 49 Ferree Racing car, where she finished 41st after an accident. Robinson failed to qualify for the race at Martinsville Speedway. She finished 54th in the Busch Series points standings.|$|E
5|$|She later {{made her}} {{debut in the}} <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> Series in the No. 84 Michael Kranefuss Racing Ford Taurus, and planned to run six races. The events were chosen because they were at tracks where Robinson felt comfortable, located in large markets where they would receive more attention. Her {{schedule}} was devised to allow Robinson time to test. She planned to race at Talladega Superspeedway but decided against {{it because of the}} rules regarding restrictor plate racing. Robinson failed to qualify for the first race she attempted (at California Speedway) when her car's rear-end gearing became detached causing her to collide with the wall. Four races later, she started from 32nd at Michigan International Speedway, and became the first woman to start a NASCAR Cup Series race since Patty Moise in 1989. Robinson finished 34th after spinning her car in the track's second turn but avoided damage. After she failed to qualify for her next two races, she was unable to complete her schedule due to sponsorship issues. Robinson stated that she used the season as motivation; she hoped to be driving consistently in five years, and wanted to be a spokesperson for women.|$|E
5|$|The {{race was}} held {{starting}} at 8pm on Saturday, October 17, 1998. Ernie Irvan {{dropped to the}} rear of the field prior to the start of the race, due to a driver change; Ricky Craven had qualified the car. Although Bobby Labonte started on pole, Dale Jarrett, who had started third, led the first lap of the race; Dale Earnhardt took the lead on lap two and held it through the first caution period of the race, for rain, for three laps starting at lap 13. A large crash occurred on lap 32; initiated by Kevin Lepage losing control of his car in turn two, the wreck collected eleven cars, including Hut Stricklin, Geoff Bodine and three-time <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> champion Darrell Waltrip; Earnhardt lost the lead during pit stops under caution to Rusty Wallace, with Dave Marcis pitting a lap later than the leaders to pick up five bonus points for leading a lap. Lepage suffered a fractured shoulder in a fall exiting his car.|$|E
25|$|Waltrip would {{continue}} his unprecedented success driving for Junior Johnson through the 1986 NASCAR <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> season, winning his third NASCAR <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> Championship, in 1985, winning the inaugural all-star race, The Winston, in 1985, and compiling 43 additional wins.|$|E
25|$|David Pearson drove a 1971 GTO in the <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> Series.|$|E
25|$|The {{event was}} also {{seen as a}} way to expand the Speedweeks {{activities}} leading up to the Daytona 500. Previously, the weekend before the Daytona 500 featured only minor support events, and the <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> competitors ordinarily would not have taken to the track until Wednesday. The Busch Clash allowed the <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> regulars to kick off the week live on CBS.|$|E
25|$|In total, the Ford Taurus has {{won three}} <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> championships and two Busch Series championships.|$|E
25|$|During {{his sophomore}} season, Earnhardt, now with 20-year-old Doug Richert as his crew chief, began the season winning the Busch Clash. With wins at Atlanta, Bristol, Nashville, Martinsville, and Charlotte, Earnhardt {{won his first}} <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> points championship. He is the only driver in NASCAR <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> history to follow a Rookie of the Year title with a NASCAR <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> Championship the next season. He was also the third driver in NASCAR history to win both the Rookie of the Year and Cup Series championship, {{following}} David Pearson (1960, 1966) and Richard Petty (1959, 1964). Only seven drivers have joined this exclusive club since: Rusty Wallace (1984, 1989), Alan Kulwicki (1986, 1992), Jeff Gordon (1993, 1995), Tony Stewart (1999, 2002), Matt Kenseth (2000, 2003), Kevin Harvick (2001, 2014), and Kyle Busch (2005, 2015).|$|E
25|$|Earnhardt ran nine Busch Series races between 1996 and 1997 for Dale Earnhardt, Inc., and Ed Whitaker, respectively, before {{driving for}} his father's {{team in the}} Busch Series {{full-time}} in 1998, in which he started the season with an amazing blowover after contact with Dick Trickle and Buckshot Jones at Daytona, on the same weekend {{that his father had}} his first and only Daytona 500 win. Earnhardt won consecutive NASCAR Busch Series Championships in 1998 and 1999 barely edging Matt Kenseth. In 1998, he made his first start in the <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> Series, at the exhibition race held in Motegi, Japan.

He also made his <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> debut at the Pyroil 500, where he finished thirty-first in the Jimmy Means-owned car. It also marked {{the first time since the}} 1950s that three brothers competed against each other in a <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> race, as Rusty and Kenny drove in that race also.|$|E
25|$|Hylton {{continued}} {{driving the}} full schedule until 1982, when he handed over driving duties to Canadian driver Trevor Boys. James soldiered on as an owner in NASCAR <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> until 1993.|$|E
25|$|Moving up {{from local}} {{competition}} during the 1970s, Johnson {{made his first}} start in NASCAR <b>Winston</b> <b>Cup</b> Series competition in 1979 at North Carolina Motor Speedway in Rockingham, North Carolina, finishing 27th in his first race in the series.
