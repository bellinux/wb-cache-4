30|$|In marine habitats, {{negative}} effects of non-native species include declines in native species richness and abundance. These impacts {{have been associated with}} the invasion of Caulerpa taxifolia into the Mediterranean [112], and with the high mortality rates of European oysters (Ostrea edulis) due to competition with introduced Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) and damage from introduced parasites. Despite these examples, there is little comprehensive evidence for most impacts of invasive marine species, and there are some examples of economic benefits. For example, the release of the red king crab (Paralithodes camtschaticus) into the Barents Sea and its southward spread along the Norwegian coast has provided an additional fishery and income for fishermen in the order of 9 million <b>EUR</b> per <b>year</b> [36].

In the short term, the emission reduction fluctuates from 11.6 to 35.0 % in every scenario. A CO 2 emission reduction to 11.6 % (1 Sc) is expected in the worst-case scenario, which is if the country continues with its existing residential sector energy-efficiency policy, and if funding, which is the main driving force of this process, is not increased. However, if the funding is increased and other economic incentives implemented including, for example, the promotion of Energy service companies (ESCO), to achieve the government’s energy-efficiency goal for 2030 (2 Sc), then it is possible to reach a 20 % reduction in the short term. The difference between 1 Sc and 2 Sc is only 8.4 % in the short term, but in the long term, it doubles and reaches 15.6 %. The financial support necessary for implementing the residential sector housing renovation processes is 60.6 million <b>EUR</b> per <b>year</b> in the case of 1 Sc.

40|$|Do minimum wages reduce in-work-poverty {{and wage}} inequality? Or can {{alternative}} policies do better? We evaluate theses {{issues for the}} exemplary case of Germany that suffers from high unemployment among low-skilled workers and rising wage dispersion {{at the bottom of}} the wage distribution. We analyze the impact of three different policy options, currently discussed in Germany, on employment, wage inequality, public expenditures, and incomes of poor households: 1) a statutory minimum wage, 2) a combination of minimum wages and wage subsidies as e. g. in France and the Netherlands, and 3) pure wage subsidies to low-paid workers. We find that a minimum <b>wage</b> of <b>EUR</b> 7. 50 would cost 840, 000 low-paid jobs and increase the fiscal burden by about EUR 4 billion per year, while poor households' income rises only by EUR 1. 1 billion per year.

RESULTS: On the basis of HERA data, our model yielded an overall survival rate of 71. 8 % for the T group versus 62. 8 % for the control group [risk ratio (RR) = 0. 87) after 10 years and 62. 9 % versus 52. 7 % (RR = 0. 84) after 15 years. Cost-effectiveness resulted in 40505 Euros (<b>EUR)</b> per life <b>years</b> gained (LYG) after 10 <b>years</b> and 19673 <b>EUR</b> per LYG after 15 years. For the FinHer regimen, overall survival after 10 and 15 years resulted in 81. 8 % versus 66. 1 % (RR = 0. 81) and 73. 6 % versus 57. 0 % (RR = 0. 77).

Although access to {{medicines}} at affordable prices had been specified {{as a key}} objective of the European Health Policy, it seems that these goals have not been achieved. Therefore, we attempted an evaluation of affordability of selected medicines at full prices.

Finally, we considered 9 originators used {{in the treatment of}} schizophrenia and multiple sclerosis. Information on drug prices were collected from pharmacies. Participation in the study was voluntary and anonymous in order to avoid accusations of advertising. To evaluate affordability, several factors were used (e. g. minimum earnings and Gini coefficient). Due to unavailability in some countries, the exact number of analyzed medicines varies. Drug prices vary significantly between EU Member States. Almost eleven fold difference was observed between Germany (EUR 1451. 17) and Croatia (EUR 132. 77) in relation to Interferone beta- 1 a 22 μg. Generally, prices were the highest in Germany.

30|$|Many {{invasive}} {{plant species}} in Europe are primarily recognized as agricultural or forestry weeds. Additionally, 17 {{out of the}} 18 plant species recorded among the most damaging invasive species in Europe [6] are known to reduce the habitat of native species [34]. Eight of them are reported to disrupt community assemblages, for example by impacting plant pollinator networks [34]. Non-native plant species can also hybridize with closely related native species so that distinctive genotypes of native plants are lost [102]. Species such as Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica) and Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera) grow and are nuisance species along railway lines (the former) and waterways (both). Other plant species can cause severe health problems. For example, giant hogweed (Herracleum mantegazzianum, Figure 1 C) produces sap that causes skin lesions to humans upon contact [103]. The pollen of invasive ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia, Figure 1 E) is highly allergenic to humans, and estimates of associated medical costs in Germany range between 17 and 47 million EUR annually [104]. According to Vilà et al. [7], the most costly plant invaders affecting nature conservation, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries in Europe are pigface species (Carpobrotus spp.). These produce annual costs for control and eradication in Spain of approximately 0.58 million EUR [105].

Historically, conventional power plants in the transmission grid were the main source providing these services. An increasing share of decentralized renewable energy in the electricity mix causes decreasing dispatch times for conventional power plants and may consequently lead to a partial replacement of these technologies. Decentralized energy sources are technically capable of providing ancillary services. This work focuses on the provision of reactive power for voltage stability from decentralized sources. The aim is {{to answer the question}} of how voltage stability and reactive power management can be achieved in a future electricity system with increasing shares of decentralized renewable energy sources in an economical and efficient way. A methodology that takes reactive power and voltage stability in an electricity system into account is developed. It allows for the evaluation of the economic benefits of different reactive power supply options. A non-linear and a linearized techno-economic grid model are formulated for this purpose. The analysis reveals an increasing importance of reactive power from the distribution grid in future development scenarios, in particular if delays in grid extension are taken into account.

The {{aim of this}} study was to estimate the incidence and hospital costs of hip fractures in Vilnius in 2010. Methods Data were collected from the medical charts of all patients admitted to hospitals in Vilnius (population, 548, 835) due to new low-energy trauma hip fracture, during 2010. The estimated costs included ambulance transportation and continuous hospitalisation immediately after a fracture, which are covered by the Lithuanian healthcare system. Results The incidence of new low-energy trauma hip fractures was 252 (308 women and 160 men) per 100, 000 inhabitants of Vilnius aged 50 -years or more. There was an exponential increase in the incidence with increasing age. The overall estimated cost of hip fractures in Vilnius was 1, 114, 292 <b>EUR</b> for the <b>year</b> 2010. The greatest part of the expenditure was accounted for by fractures in individuals aged 65 -years and over. The mean cost per case was 2, 526. 74 EUR, and cost varied depending on the treatment type. Hip replacement did not affect the overall mean costs of hip fracture. The majority of costs were incurred for acute (53 %) and long-term care (35 %) hospital stays, while medical rehabilitation accounted for only 12 % of the overall cost. The costs of hip fracture were somewhat lower than those found in other European countries.

40|$|About 17 % of the {{territory}} of Western and Northern Europe (including {{the western part of}} Central Europe) is covered by grasslands. Of these 1 / 5 are natural grasslands, mainly in arctic-alpine and coastal areas, while 4 / 5 are secondary grasslands created via millennia of human land management, such as grazing, mowing and burning. As long as technological constraints limited the intensity of use, grasslands accumulated a lot of biodiversity, making them now the most species-rich habitat for many taxa. The direct economic value of agricultural products from grasslands (mainly dairy and meat) is 71 billion <b>EUR</b> per <b>year</b> (0. 7 % of the Gross Domestic Product of the region), while other ecosystem services like water and nitrogen retention, erosion control, biodiversity conservation and touristic use of traditional cultural landscapes together have a significantly higher value. After World War II, the situation of grasslands changed dramatically due to the excessive use of artificial fertilizer, much increased livestock numbers and the large-scale homogenization of site conditions towards mesic nutrient-rich situations. On the other hand, less productive and more remote sites were not profitable for agricultural use anymore and thus were abandoned (and subject to secondary succession). Both intensification and abandonment have strong negative impacts on grassland biodiversity. Many grassland habitats and their species are now highly threatened. Further important threat factors for grasslands in the region are airborne eutrophication and conversion to other land uses (croplands, forests, built-up areas), while we consider climate change, biotic invasions and direct human impacts to be less relevant than often thought. While grasslands are underrepresented among the nationally protected areas of the region, the Habitats Directive of the European Union put many of the more threatened grassland types into the conservation focus, so that they are now reasonably covered in the Natura 2000 network (spatially at least). Maintenance or restoration of semi-natural grasslands of High Nature Value (HNV) requires that they are managed in a way that mimics traditional agricultural use with hay-making and low-intensity grazing, but can also involve new approaches, such as controlled burning, “semi-open pasture landscapes” or “extensive green roofs”, which sometimes might be more feasible in the current socioeconomic situation. Semi-natural grasslands are a unique feature of the cultural landscapes of Europe. We conclude that conserving them and their biodiversity for the future requires a drastic further “greening” of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the EU and of similar instruments in the non-EU countries of the region, while at the same conservationists should be more open-minded towards conservation approaches that go beyond designation of protected areas and mimicking traditional grassland management...|$|R
40|$|The work {{shown below}} takes its place {{about at the}} {{midpoint}} between the research that investigates the physiological response to specific external stimulus or to the induction of specific moods and the rehabilitation – supported by robotic systems or virtual reality based system – of the superior arm after cerebral damage. The goal {{of this study is}} to find a meeting point between these two disciplines, putting the first one at the service of the second one, with the intent to adapt the actually in use systems not only to the physical capabilities of the user, but to his/her mood as well. For this purpose it has been realized a sensing system that acquires, together with the gesture of the superior arm – and of the hand in particular – a physiological characteristic that has been admitted by the scientific community as a good indicator of the ANS activity: Skin Conductance. It is acquired by textile sensors, sent wirelessly to a computer and then processed. After the observation of data obtained by tasks which included in a first time only movement and then movement together with physiological variation, various methods have been developed to allow distinguishing the movement artifact on the acquired signal. In this way it is possible to separate peaks generated by physiological response from those generated by movement. Successive studies could permit an appropriate characterization of recorded physiological variation in terms of stress level, or based on the patient’s mood; an application for the characterized variations would also be possible. In particular, characteristics extracted by physiological variation could be used for example to control the difficulty of rehabilitative tasks, which now is only related to the patient’s performance. A system like the one showed above could also be easily used at home, using only the glove here presented, attached with its acquisition system and a personal computer. The costs of transport to the clinic, to hire somebody that assists the patient and accompanies him/her to the physician and the cost of the therapy itself are therefore avoided.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the impact of the co-existence of overarching ‘command and control’ regulatory policies on the cost-effectiveness of subordinate Emission Trading Systems (ETS). The Netherlands introduced an ETS in 2005 as a cost-effective measure to decrease the emission of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) in stationary sources. The ETS was repealed after eight years, however, because of the limited effectiveness of the scheme. The influence of the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive (IPPC), a regulatory standard adopted to achieve industrial emission objectives at the European level, was anticipated to be a cause of this limited effectiveness. The Dutch NOx ETS was, therefore, chosen as the focus for this study as it allows key questions to be addressed about the influence of vertical interactions between overarching climate regulations and Emission Trading Schemes on the cost-effectiveness of the trading scheme. The influence on the cost-effectiveness of the ETS was assessed by calculating the specific costs of the actual implemented abatement techniques in terms of EUR/kg NOx abated and comparing these to the remaining least-cost abatement potential. Data from the emission reports of all participants of the NOx ETS, as provided by the NEa, was used to assess the abatement techniques. The abatement techniques not found in the emission reports were found by means of a company survey and cost functions in the literature were used to assess the specific cost of each measure. The results, explaining 17. 5 ktons of the total 20. 2 ktons NOx NOx abatement achieved in 2012, showed that 16 ktons abated NOx emissions were attained at relatively low-cost. Since virtually all abatement originated from companies subject to the IPPC, it is clear that the directive undermined the functioning of the emission market. Because of the interaction between the Directive and the NOx ETS, 1 kton of abatement was attained at significantly higher cost than remaining least-cost abatement potential and thus caused estimated additional abatement costs of 10 million <b>EUR</b> per <b>year.</b> Compared to the regulatory cost of the ETS, however, the additional abatement costs were shown to be relatively limited. The IPPC Directive succeeded in enforcing a large proportion of abatement at relatively low cost, thereby reducing the gain in cost-effectiveness achievable by an ETS with no interactions. The reason for this was found to be due to the sensitivity of the IPPC emission limits to the cost-effectiveness of abatement measures and the relative homogeneity of the cost of NOx abatement techniques...|$|R
50|$|Several nearby {{countries}} assisted Grenada in its aftermath. The {{government of}} Guyana shipped about $250,000 (2004 USD, $40 million 2004 GYD) worth of sugar, {{as well as}} 100 members of the Guyana Defense Force to assist in restoring order and reconstruction. The government of Trinidad and Tobago sent 190 policemen, {{and the government of}} Anguilla sent 1,230 cases of water. A committee of Caribbean nations realized the local governments could not provide the support that Grenada needed in its aftermath, and thus turned to international assistance. Within a day of Ivan passing to the south of Grenada, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) deployed 67,600 gallons of water, 500 rolls of plastic sheeting, four 10,000 liter water bladder kits, and a water treatment kit; assistance from USAID totaled $6 million (2004 USD) within a few weeks of the storm's passage, primarily in aid for reconstruction and rehabilitation. In the weeks subsequent to the hurricane, the European Commission Humanitarian aid Office (ECHO) provided €3 million (2004 <b>EUR).</b> By a <b>year</b> later, housing redevelopments and disaster preparation problems continued after being impacted by Hurricane Emily; as a result, the ECHO provided €1.2 million (2005 EUR) to Grenada in September 2005. Nine months after the hurricane, Chinese officials provided assistance in reconstruction and handling foreign debts after meeting with the Grenadian Prime Minister; in 2007, Chinese officials funded {{the construction of a new}} $40 million (2007 USD) cricket stadium near St. George's. The Caribbean Development Bank approved a $10 million loan (2004 USD) requested by the government of Grenada in July 2005, which was intended to assist in long-term development of the housing, business, and environmental sectors. Emergency operations in Grenada in coordination with the Pan American Disaster Response Unit ended in July 2005.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} the sports services market in Slovenia, besides the educational system, based on an analysis of several sources of public data: the income structure of sports organizations involving a sample of 8, 092 organizations, the population’s consumption expenditure on sport using a representative sample and the public expenditure on sport according to reports about the realization of the national programme for sport in Slovenia. The research reveals that the total expenditure on sport in Slovenia in the studied year of 2005 amounted to 1. 93 % of GDP. In the structure of expenditure, the largest share of 85 % is taken by private money (corporations, households), whereas public funding (state budgeting, local authorities, lottery money, EU funding) amounts to slightly less than 15 %. The overall amount of expenditure was constantly rising until 2005 due to a stronger economic growth in Slovenia. Nevertheless, the amount spent on sport lags behind the increase in the population’s consumption expenditure on the so-called leisure industry, resulting in sport losing the market share within the industry. The average Slovenian household spends 2. 88 % of the family budget on sport, equalling <b>EUR</b> 496 per <b>year.</b> Two-thirds of these funds are spent on sports products and one-third on sports services. More and more sports services are being offered by the private sector, although the non-governmental sports sector created 70. 6 % of the total income of sports organizations. Left unchallenged, the weaknesses of the Slovenian sports services market could become a real obstacle to the further successful development of sport; therefore, some countermeasures to improve and form new sports services are presented in {{the last part of the}} paper.
