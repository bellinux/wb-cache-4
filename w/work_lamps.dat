5000|$|The demos were re-recorded with Matt Bayles at Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard's own Studio Litho. After {{three days}} of {{recording}} and two days of mixing, the completed songs became Botch's debut studio album American Nervoso, released in 1998 through Hydra Head Records. In support of American Nervoso, Botch headlined a North American tour with The Dillinger Escape Plan and Jesuit. Beginning with this tour, John Pettibone was hired as the group's manager, and it also was Botch's first time bringing their own lighting equipment with them. Their stage setup included several halogen <b>work</b> <b>lamps</b> plugged into a power strip with a switch. Commenting on the lights, Dave Verellen said, [...] "I hated the lights at clubs, which were always on the band, so we figured we'd turn them on the audience. ... I liked it because I could see people's reaction in the crowd because their faces were totally illuminated." [...] Also during this tour, Botch played music from the girl group Destiny's Child before they went on stage, which was intentionally drastically different from the more traditional [...] "metal music played in between the metal bands." [...] Botch were also rumored to be recording a Destiny's Child covers EP—however, this release never materialized.|$|E

40|$|In {{accordance}} with the enhancement for luminous efficiency improving, LED (Light Emitting Diode) has been gradu-ally developed by combining the characteristics of small volume, impact resistance, good reliability, long life, low power consumption with multiple purposes for energy saving and environmental protection. Therefore, the array LED has been widely applied in human livings nowadays. This study applies the finite element analysis software ANSYS to analyze the thermal behavior of the array power LED <b>work</b> <b>lamp</b> which is modeled by four same-size LED with MCPCB (Metal Core Print Circuit Board) mounted on a base heat-sink. The Flotran heat flow analysis is applied to obtain the natural convection of air coefficient, while the convection value can be confirmed by the iterative method since it is set as the boundary condition for ANSYS thermal analysis to obtain the temperature distribution, accordingly the chip junction temperature and the base heat-sink temperature were followed through experiments in order to check if the simulation results meet the design requirements and coincide with the power LED product design specification. Prior to the optimal design process for chip junction temperature, the most significant parameters were first chosen by the fractional factorial design. The regressive models were respectively setup by the dual response surface method (RSM) and the mixed response surface method. Furthermore, the genetic algorithm combined with response surface method was applied to acquire the optimal design parameters, {{and the results were}} obtained from both methods, whic...|$|R

40|$|LAMP is an innovative, simple, rapid, {{specific}} and cost-effective nucleic acid amplification method. Due {{to the use}} of a special enzyme – GspSSD polymerase, the reaction takes a short time and can be performed at isothermal conditions. The sensitivity and specificity of LAMP technique is significantly higher, than standard PCR techniques, as two or three specific primer pairs are used. The technique is regarded as a useful tool for the detection and identification of plant pathogens. In this <b>work,</b> <b>LAMP</b> was used to study the composition of the population of fungi of the genus Leptosphaeria, causing a damaging disease of oilseed rape, called blackleg or stem canker. The detection concerned DNA present in fungal spores contained in air samples obtained using Hirst-type volumetric trap, in Pomerania (north Poland) in 2010. The results achieved using the LAMP technique were similar to these obtained with previously used, highly specific method of Real-time PCR. Conducting LAMP reaction was much easier and less time-and cost-consuming, due to a simplified method of DNA isolation of pathogens from plant tissues. Then, the LAMP technique was used to assess the composition of the population of Leptosphaeria spp. in plants of oil- seed rape collected from the field in the Opole region (south-we- stern part of Poland) in 2013. In contrast to studies conducted in 2002 – 2003, the analysis of leaf symptoms showed a higher pro- portion of L. maculans compared to L. biglobosa, what reflects changes in the composition of pathogen population of fungi causing blackleg on oilseed rape in this part of Poland...|$|R
