40|$|The current paper {{presents}} the socio-economical feasibility {{study on the}} reorganisation of waste management in Harju County through waste management cooperation centre. The objective of the research was to estimate the improvement of administrative efficiency, and economical cost-effectiveness resulting from reorganisation of waste management administration. In the analysis two different scenarios were assessed in comparison of the current situation (basic scenario) from the aspects of economical and administrative cost-effectiveness. The waste management situation and cash flow, including waste collection services, source sorting options, <b>waste</b> <b>holders</b> and municipal budgets of waste management administration were mapped. Also a risk assessment of the qualitative indicators was compiled. The main problems of the basic scenario stand in the administrative inefficiency and financial shortage of waste management. The analysed project scenarios enable to improve both administrativ...|$|R

40|$|The {{composition}} of {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) influences the incineration process. The high heat value of some materials contained in the waste and their moisture content affects {{the capacity of the}} process. In particular, the plastics presence negatively affects the incineration process: an increase of calorific value means a reduction of the capacity of the incineration plant. The throughput of the incinerator can be limited for both purely mechanical reasons and by thermal and mechanical overload. The thermal stress can be calculated starting from the calorific value of the waste fed to the incinerator. In this paper, innovative measurements of calorific value and hydrogen content of MSW fed to incinerators have been carried out, in order to improve the technical operation of incineration plants. A calorimetric bomb was used for waste heat measurements and a neutron probe analysis was tested for hydrogen content determination in waste. Measurements have been carried out on different typologies of household waste products characteristics of four towns in the Netherlands. A special <b>waste</b> sample <b>holder</b> was designed and different detection architectures based on neutron sensing techniques were utilised to perform hydrogen content analysis. Starting from the results achieved in this study the possibility to regulate the heat value of the waste and its combustion in order to optimize the incineration process has been envisaged...|$|R
2500|$|Among {{the pros}} Dempsey met were George Low, the popular Baltusrol club player and Tommy Kerrigan, the {{sharpshooter}} of the Siwanoy Country Club. Each pro invited Dempsey to play over their course {{when he came}} east. Summit, New Jersey, the home of Freddie Welsh's health farm, where Dempsey trained, is near the Baltusrol club, {{so that when he}} went to Summit the title <b>holder</b> <b>wasted</b> no time in looking up his old friend Low. Since then Dempsey played a round daily. And he intended to play one round a day, or as often as possible, until he started strenuous training, three weeks before the time of his next fight. He had developed an interest in the game, liked it, and found it a big help in his training. For, as he said, [...] "it takes a person out into the air and makes a pleasure of walking".|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1982 This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to observe the manner in which three local public interest organizations participated in a local, environmentallyoriented decision process. The study period began in December, 1978, with the passage of a revised solid waste ordinance (Ord. 78 - 102) for the City of Corvallis, OR. The main forum for public participation {{during the first year of}} the study centered around the Resource Recovery Advisory Task Force (RRATF), established in December, 1978, to discuss solid waste issues and make recommendations to the Corvallis City Council. In December, 1979, the Corvallis City Council accepted the RRATF recommendations, which called for the creation of a new, pe manent advisory board (the Source-Separation Board); the development of a new ordinance, separate from the solid waste ordinance, to address source separation services; and the use of the RRATF Final Report as a guideline for City decisions. In November, 1980, Ord. 80 - 98 was passed by the City Council. This ordinance amended Ord. 78 - 102 to include the provision of source separation services by the existing solid <b>waste</b> franchise <b>holder,</b> Corvallis Disposal Co. (CDC) and marked the end of the study period. The study considers the issues addressed by RRATF, City staff, City Council, CDC, the public interest organizations and the Source Separation Board, and describes the techniques employed by the involved organizations to influence decisions regarding these issues. Although numerous influencing efforts were made, the study concludes that the most powerful tool for impacting solid waste decisions appears to be control of the flow of waste materials, rather than the use of a particular political technique. The study also documents the considerable influence held by paid City staff, when compared to Citizen Advisory Committees, elected officials, and the general public...|$|R

40|$|Irish and European waste {{legislation}} has progressed through {{a myriad of}} legislative waste revisions over the last 35 years. The complex web of legislation includes; 1975 - Council Directive on Waste (75 / 442 /EEC) 1991 - Council Directive on Waste (91 / 156 /EEC) 1993 - Establishment of Environmental Protection Agency (Ireland) 1994 - European Waste Catalogue Published 1996 - Waste Management Act (Ireland) 1998 - 2 ̆ 7 Changing Our Ways 2 ̆ 7 Irish Waste Policy 1999 - Council Directive on Landfill (99 / 31 /EC) 2001 - Waste Management Amendment Act (Ireland) 2002 - New European Waste Catalogue 2002 - 2 ̆ 7 Preventing & Recycling Waste- Delivering Change 2 ̆ 7 New Irish Waste Policy 2003 - Council Directive on Acceptance of Waste at Landfills (2003 / 33 /EC) 2004 - National Waste Prevention Programme Launched (Ireland) 2003 - Thematic Strategy on Prevention and Recycling of Waste 2006 - Council Directive on Waste (2006 / 12 /EC) 2006 - National Strategy on Biodegradable Waste (Ireland) 2008 - Council Directive on Waste (2008 / 98 /EC) 2009 - National Waste Prevention Program (2009 - 2012) Launched (Ireland) 2010 - Deadline for entry of 2008 / 98 /EC into force in all member states (12 th Dec) While the body of legislation is comprehensive, a major debate still reigns on one central issue; What is the legal definition of Waste?. Throughout {{the history of the}} various Waste Directives, this issue has perplexed the courts in many of the member states and has consistently been referred to the European Court of Justice for interpretation and definition. Cichowski (1999) reported that national judges within the EU had asked the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for 6 interpretation of waste law more than any other subject from the beginnings of the waste directive in 1976 through to 1998. This dissertation reviews the key literature and European Court of Justice (ECJ) case histories involving the definition of waste. It also reviews similar cases involving waste definition in the Irish courts and discusses the issues associated with the definition both at a National and a Community level. It also previews some future waste definition issues likely to require further determination in the future. As a result of this research, it is clear that confusion regarding the exact definition of <b>waste</b> and indeed <b>holders</b> of <b>waste</b> still exists at a legislative level. As case law has evolved, the European Court has substantially changed its definition of waste. Furthermore, {{it is also clear that}} through analysis of cases such as Brady vs the EPA and the Commission vs Spain, there are significant differences between the National Courts and the Community on this definition. Finally it is also apparent that the development of Â¿End of WasteÂ¿ criteria will further complicate an already confused picture at both a National and Community level...|$|R
5000|$|Arizona {{follows the}} prior {{appropriation}} doctrine for determining water rights. There are {{three categories of}} tradable rights in Arizona: surface water rights under Common Law Rights, surface water rights under Statutory Rights, and groundwater rights created by Arizona’s 1980 Groundwater Code. [...] The former two surface water rights pertain to any surface water in Arizona excluding flows in the Colorado River (Colorado River water rights are governed extraneously, by the Colorado River Compact). Specifically, appropriated surface water can be: [...] "Waters of all sources, flowing in streams, canyons, ravines or other natural channels, or in definite underground channels, whether perennial or intermittent, floodwaters, wastewater, or surplus water, and of lakes, ponds and springs on the surface" [...] (A.R.S. §45-101). Common Law Rights apply to surface water diversions appropriated prior {{to the creation of}} Arizona’s 1919 Public Water Code and are senior rights. Statutory Rights apply to any appropriation claimed after 1919, in which case the claimant must apply for and receive a permit from the Arizona Department of Water Resource (ADWR) before diverting claimed surface water. Rights holders must apply appropriated water to beneficial use (recognized as domestic, municipal, irrigation, stockwatering, power, mining, recreation, wildlife and fish, or groundwater recharge) or risk forfeiture of rights (which occurs if water is not applied to beneficial use for 5 or more consecutive years). Arizona permits transfer of surface water rights, however there are maximum limits to the amount of water transferred and temporal duration of the transfer (A.R.S. §45-1002), and transfers are subject to review and approval by the ADWR. In the case of transfers to instream flows to benefit fish, wildlife, or recreation, rights holders may follow a [...] "sever and transfer" [...] process, by which the holder permanently transfers the water right to the State of Arizona or a political subdivision (as trustees of instream flows), pending approval of the ADWR. This type of transfer will preserve the priority status of the water right, so that if the right transferred is a senior right, the benefiting instream flow will receive its water allocation before junior rights holders {{in the case of a}} water shortage. This transfer process is boon to ecosystem health and recreational value because wildlife and fish were not recognized as beneficial uses until 1941 and 1962, respectively. Groundwater rights transfers are more restricted relative to surface water. The 1980 Arizona Groundwater Code created jurisdictions called [...] "Active Management Areas" [...] (AMA) in parts of the state with high water demand, such as Phoenix, Tucson, and Prescott. Groundwater rights owners living in places outside of AMAs are entitled to a [...] "reasonable" [...] quantity of pumped groundwater that can be applied to beneficial use without <b>waste.</b> Groundwater rights <b>holders</b> outside of AMAs may transfer rights under certain conditions and are rarely permitted to transfer groundwater outside the hydrologic basin. Groundwater transfers within AMAs are also permissible, but are even more restricted, and groundwater regulation in AMAs is different and much stricter than regulation outside of AMAs. Legal rules governing water exchanges in Arizona are codified in Title 45, Chapter 4, of the Arizona Revised Statutes. Water transfers within Arizona are most common in the Phoenix AMA.|$|R
