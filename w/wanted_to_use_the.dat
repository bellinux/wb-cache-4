5|$|The NGS deemed {{this gun}} {{obsolete}} {{shortly after the}} first ships were laid down, but the gun that it <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use,</b> <b>the</b> Canon de 138 mm modèle 1923, was not yet available, so they planned to replace the 130mm guns later.

50|$|However, stances {{are limited}} in that only {{particular}} stances may be used with a certain equipment type, e.g., a fighter <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> Roof Guard stance would have <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a Great Sword, rather than a sword and shield. A musketeer <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> Flintlock stance would have <b>to</b> <b>use</b> a Rifle, rather than a pistol.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the inspection, Sir Francis Flemming, the Lieutenant-General of the Ordnance, was tasked in February 1558 to improve the defences on the islands, {{supported}} by a shipment of lead to help with construction, and money raised from the dissolution of the monasteries in England. The building work initially focused on the island of Tresco and was carried out under the direction of John Killigrew, the captain of Pendennis Castle in Falmouth. Tresco was in need of modern defences, but Killigrew also <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> work programme to increase his political influence on the island.|$|E

5|$|Between 1994 and 1998, {{there was}} local {{political}} debate about how Rikshospitalet, that {{was moving to}} Gaustad, should be served by public transport. The state wanted to extend the Ullevål Hageby Line of the tramway to the new hospital, while many local politicians <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> rapid transit. Since the Ring Line would increase traffic on the Songsvann Line, moving the line was considered to better serve the hospital. In 1998, an agreement was reached whereby the light rail line would be built, and a new station for transfer from the metro would open at Forskningsparken.|$|E

5|$|Notably, {{the comic}} strip stories' {{holographic}} characters, predominately Rimmer, were drawn in grayscale. This was {{at the request of}} Grant and Naylor, who had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> technique for the television series, but the process was deemed too expensive to produce. Despite achieving circulation figures of over 40,000 per month, the magazine's publisher decided to close the title down to concentrate on their other publications. A farewell issue was published, cover dated January 1994, and featured the remaining interviews, features, and comic strips that were to feature in the following issues.|$|E
5|$|The {{first thing}} {{he had to do}} was {{determine}} the characteristics of the aircraft that would be used. There were only two Allied aircraft large enough: the British Avro Lancaster and the US Boeing B-29 Superfortress. The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> B-29 if at all possible, even though it required substantial modification. Ramsey supervised the test drop program, which began at Dahlgren, Virginia, in August 1943, before moving to Muroc Dry Lake, California, in March 1944. Mock ups of Thin Man and Fat Man bombs were dropped and tracked by an SCR-584 ground based radar set of the kind that Ramsey had helped develop at the Radiation laboratory. Numerous problems were discovered with the bombs and the aircraft modifications, and corrected.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of a}} grand Shakespeare edition was {{conceived}} at a dinner at Josiah Boydell’s home in November 1786. The guest list itself is evidence of Boydell’s extensive connections in the artistic world: Benjamin West, painter to King George III; George Romney, a renowned painter; George Nicol, bookseller to the king and painter; William Hayley, a poet; John Hoole, a scholar and translator of Tasso and Aristotle; and Daniel Braithwaite, an engineer. Most sources also list the painter Paul Sandby. Although the initial idea for the edition was probably not Boydell's, {{he was the one}} to seize and pursue it. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> edition to facilitate the development of a British school of history painting.|$|E

5|$|Written by Lewis Greifer, {{this story}} was {{commissioned}} in July 1974. The story would involve museum keepers being chased out of the British Museum by a mummy.

The group <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> rice to seed Mars and make a fortune.

5|$|By spring 1944, the Me 262 was {{sufficiently}} ready for operational service. By this time, Galland faced rivalries amongst the Luftwaffe command over {{how best to}} employ the aircraft. Dietrich Peltz, commander of the IX. Fliegerkorps (9th Air Corps), <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> aircraft as a weapon against a future Allied landing in France. Peltz saw the aircraft as an ideal fast bomber which could evade the overwhelming numbers of Allied piston-engine fighters and attack the landing grounds. Peltz also wished to use highly trained bomber pilots who he felt could better serve as home defence fighter pilots {{in place of the}} overextended and overworked Jagdwaffe. Their blind-weather experience and training, and background in multi-engine aircraft made them ideal for these operations in his view. In the first five months of 1944, Peltz' conventional bomber force had suffered a significant defeat over England in Operation Steinbock but it did not dull his appetite for offensive action or dent his reputation with Göring. Galland argued against his suggestion. Instead, Galland thought the bomber corps should be disbanded and its pilots converted onto fighters. Göring adopted Peltz' idea to impress Hitler and regain his waning influence.|$|E
5|$|Carte's London {{house was}} at the Adelphi, {{not far from the}} Savoy. Passionate about the visual arts as well as the {{performing}} arts, Carte invited his friend, the artist James McNeill Whistler, to decorate the house. Whistler had the entire billiard room painted the colour of the billiard cloth, and elsewhere painted his favourite yellow with his own hand. Equally enthusiastic for technological innovation, Carte installed a lift, the first in a private house in England. Around 1890, he bought a small island in the River Thames, between Weybridge and Shepperton, called Folly Eyot, which he renamed D'Oyly Carte Island. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> island as an annex to his new Savoy Hotel, but the local authorities refused to grant him a drinks licence for the property. Instead, he built Eyot House, a large house and garden on the island, that he used as a residence. In later years, Carte displayed his macabre sense of humour by keeping a crocodile on the island.|$|E

5|$|In Act III, {{the player}} meets the Founder of the Academy, and Safiya realizes that she, Lienna, and Nefris are all {{splinters}} of the Founder’s soul, {{and that the}} Founder was once Akachi’s lover. The Founder explains that, while Lienna and Nefris understood their identities, the truth was hidden from Safiya for her own safety. The Founder also admits that she {{is responsible for the}} player's plight – she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> player to end the spirit-eater curse (and Akachi’s suffering, as well). She returns the silver sword of Gith to the player, which allows him to open the Betrayer's Gate and travel to the realm of the dead. There the player finds the City of Judgment, ruled by the current God of the Dead, Kelemvor Lyonsbane. As the player arrives, an army is assembling outside the walls, led by Akachi’s captains from his First Crusade – Zoab, a fallen solar, Rammaq, a demilich, and Sey'ryu, a blue dragon. The captains recognize the player as Akachi’s heir, and the player must decide whether to lead their crusade against the City of Judgment or to oppose them.|$|E
5|$|Lighting and {{its effect}} on characters' skin was of {{particular}} importance to the Business Division 2 team, with a lot of work going into making sure shading and transparency fitted with each character's position in a scene in relation to its lighting. Previsualization was initially going to be done entirely in-house, but the team eventually decided to bring in The Third Floor, an external company specializing in previsualization. The Third Floor ended up handling around 40% of the work. The animation was also supposed to be handled in-house using the V-Ray software, but the team found it difficult to adapt the software to their needs. As Nozue <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> experience and technology of Visual Works to create Kingsglaive, they decided to bring in experienced and dedicated outside help to handle V-Ray. This resulted in the cooperation with Digic Pictures, which included former staff from Square Enix's North American branch and were highly skilled in the creation of high-quality cutscenes. For procedural environmental elements such as falling rubble, they used the Houdini animation software.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi, {{as the second}} entry in a planned Ace Attorney trilogy. It was originally intended to feature the first game's prosecutor, Miles Edgeworth, in all episodes; Franziska was created when the development team learned that Edgeworth had become popular among players, and Takumi <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> character more carefully and sparingly. They only introduced one new gameplay mechanic in the game; Takumi {{wanted to keep the}} game focused on the core concept of finding lies, and to keep it simple enough for his mother to play. The game was positively received by critics, who generally liked the writing, but criticized the game's short length and the lack of the Nintendo DS-exclusive gameplay mechanics that appeared in the previous game.|$|E

5|$|As {{in many of}} his {{previous}} pursuits, Burnet set an ambitious agenda for himself but ran into difficulties. He saw the Academy as the peak lobby group {{of the scientific community}} and their main liaison with government and industry. He tried to lift its profile and use it to persuade the political and industrial leadership to invest more in science. He also <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> Academy to increase the involvement of the eminent scientists of Australia in training and motivating the next generation, but these initiatives were not successful {{due to a lack of}} concrete method. Most controversially, he tried to change the membership criteria of the Academy. He wanted to stop the Royal Society from operating in Australia and accepting new Australian members. He reasoned that the Australian Academy would not be strong if the Royal Society would be able to compete with it, and he felt that if Australian scientists were allowed to possess membership of the both bodies, the more established Royal Society would make the Australian Academy look poor in comparison. Questions were raised over the existing dual members—such as Burnet—being able to maintain their status and the hypocrisy thereby entailed in Burnet's nationalistic proposal, and it was defeated heavily.|$|E
5|$|On 14 July 1960, in {{response}} to requests by Prime Minister Lumumba, the UN Security Council adopted United Nations Security Council Resolution 143. This called upon Belgium to remove its troops and for the UN to provide 'military assistance' to the Congolese forces to allow them 'to meet fully their tasks'. Lumumba demanded that Belgium remove its troops immediately, threatening to seek help from the Soviet Union {{if they did not}} leave within two days. The UN reacted quickly and established the United Nations Operation in the Congo (ONUC). The first UN troops arrived the next day but there was instant disagreement between Lumumba and the UN over the new force's mandate. Because the Congolese army had been in disarray since the mutiny, Lumumba <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> UN troops to subdue Katanga by force. Referring to the resolution, Lumumba wrote to UN Secretary General Dag Hammarskjöld, 'From these texts it is clear that, contrary to your personal interpretation, the UN force may be used to subdue the rebel government of Katanga.' Secretary General Hammarskjöld refused. To Hammarskjöld, the secession of Katanga was an internal Congolese matter and the UN was forbidden to intervene by Article 2 of the United Nations Charter. Disagreements over what the UN force could and could not do continued throughout its deployment.|$|E
5|$|The {{craft of}} making reborn dolls {{began in the}} United States in the late 1990s. Reborning follows a long {{tradition}} of collectors, artists, and manufacturers restoring and enhancing dolls in order to portray more realism. The internet has allowed doll artists and collectors to create an online society focused on reborn dolls. In 2002, the first reborn was offered on eBay. This has expanded the reborn market allowing artists to open online stores which function figuratively as nurseries. The niche market for the dolls began with doll collectors who admired the superior lifelike accuracy of the doll. The market quickly reached those who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> doll as an emotional outlet, either to mother or for therapeutic purposes. Mass media coverage has helped to develop the phenomenon in other countries. Reborning enjoys popularity in the United Kingdom and Australia, but has also reached Canada, the rest of Europe, Africa, and Latin America. Doll manufacturers have also taken advantage of the trend and sell supplies, tools, and accessories catering to reborn followers. This has allowed reborners to invent new techniques causing the dolls to become increasingly realistic over time. Magazines, books, organizations, and conventions dedicated to reborn dolls have been started {{as a result of this}} popularity.|$|E
