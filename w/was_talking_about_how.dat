25|$|On October 10, 2001, boxing trainer Eddie Futch {{died at age}} 90. Tim Smith of the New York Daily News remembered an {{encounter}} with the trainer in an article. One of the last times I saw Futch was before the Floyd Mayweather Jr.–Diego Corrales junior lightweight title bout in Vegas. Futch <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> much he admired Mayweather's style, how Mayweather was such a beautiful boxer, able to slip along the ropes and avoid punches. Corrales {{said he was going}} to neutralize Mayweather's hand speed by hitting Mayweather on the arms. 'I guess he thinks he's going to stand there and let him hit him on the arms all night,' said Futch, who correctly predicted that Mayweather would completely dismantle Corrales in a defensive masterpiece. Futch had a way of cutting to the heart of a matter. I don't know anyone in boxing who won't miss him. I don't know anyone in boxing that can take his place.|$|E

5000|$|Anime in hip hop is {{a recent}} {{phenomenon}} where anime and Hip Hop, two vastly different subcultures, have collided {{to form a new}} subgenre in today's globalised popular culture. Many notary rappers such as RZA (of Wu- Tang Clan), Chris Brown, Kanye West, and Frank Ocean have been known to take inspiration from anime when creating their music. In recent years anime and Hip Hop have come together to create some amazing things, and this subgenre continues to grow popularity. In mid 2015 a Canadian rapper by the name of Sese, a.k.a. Lord Frieza caught the attention of this subgenre when he released his notorious mix-tape [...] "The Frieza Saga" [...] which was entirely inspired by Dragon Ball Z. “One of my friends <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> epic the battles on Dragon Ball Z were and then we started talking about how crazy the parallels between hip-hop and the show are,” Sese explains.|$|E

5000|$|Wixson {{was born}} in Wichita, Kansas on April 11, 1994 to Thomas, who works {{installing}} satellite dishes, and Michele, a school bus driver. She has a sister, Kirsten. Wixson inherited her gapped teeth from her father. As a young girl {{she wanted to be}} either a chef or a lawyer. In middle school, Wixson was bullied, having her tooth gap called a [...] "parking lot", making her self-conscious about her looks. At 12 years old and 5'7", strangers would come up to her to tell her she could be a model, so she started researching it as a possible career. Around the same time, she was inspired by an article in the Reader's Digest about Bill Gates and other millionaires, stating that [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> they took the chance and they took their opportunities and they took it to a whole other level". Wixson decided to become a model, and studied old copies of Vogue, looking at the careers of supermodels like Gisele, Christy and Kate. Wixson first signed with a local agent in Kansas, but had no success, so her parents made the decision to take out a loan and drive down to Los Angeles.|$|E

5000|$|He {{returned}} to Atlanta, and was recruited as the frontman by Dennis St. John and the Cardinals, who supported Tommy Roe at one gig. They ultimately backed Hannibal {{on most of}} his subsequent recordings with the Shurfine label, and played live engagements with Hannibal around Atlanta. Hannibal's first release with Shurfine was [...] "Jerkin' the Dog," [...] (1965) a modest success for a basic teen dance record. The similarly framed [...] "Fishin' Pole" [...] followed in 1966. The same year Hannibal adopted a more socially conscious stance. He stated [...] "Me and my wife were watching the news and Walter Cronkite <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> all the soldiers were coming back from Vietnam addicted to opium." [...] The couple penned [...] "Hymn No. 5" [...] {{in a short time}} space, and it duly became his best known recording, reaching No. 21 on the Billboard R&B chart. The success the track brought however fueled a growing heroin addiction, and Hannibal spent eighteen months in prison for failing to pay a tax bill. Released from jail and free of drugs, he restarted his recording career in the early 1970s now billed as King Hannibal. He issued a number of singles and an album, Truth, (1973) on the Aware label. His singles included [...] "I'm Coming Home," [...] another social comment on the ongoing Vietnam situation, and the anti-drug song, [...] "The Truth Shall Make You Free (St. John 8:32)," [...] a No. 37 R&B hit in 1973.|$|E
5000|$|The screenplay, {{written by}} Rafael Moreu, is highly {{inspired}} by the hacker and cyberpunk subcultures. He saw the film as more than just about computer hacking but something much larger: [...] "In fact, to call hackers a counterculture makes it sound like they're a transitory thing; I think they're {{the next step in}} human evolution." [...] He had been interested in hacking since the early 1980s. After the crackdown in the United States during 1989 and 1990, he decided to write a script about the subculture. For research, Moreu went to a meeting organized by the New York-based hacker magazine 2600: The Hacker Quarterly. There, he met Phiber Optik, a.k.a. Mark Abene, a 22-year-old hacker who spent most of 1994 in prison on hacking charges. Moreu also hung out with other young hackers being harassed by the government and began to figure out how it would translate into a film. He remembered, [...] "One guy <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> he'd done some really interesting stuff with a laptop and payphones and that cracked it for me, because it made it cinematic". The character Eugene Belford uses Babbage as a pseudonym {{at the end of the}} film, a reference to Charles Babbage, an inventor of an early form of the computer. The fictional computer mainframe named the [...] "Gibson" [...] is a homage to cyberpunk author William Gibson and originator of the term [...] "Cyberspace", first in his 1982 short story Burning Chrome and later in his 1984 book Neuromancer.|$|E

40|$|For APO, RMIT 2 ̆ 7 s Binoy Kampmark {{reflects}} {{on a story}} of embittered stinginess that never ends. This {{is a story of}} embittered stinginess that never ends. Poorer countries have done more, and have been more conspicuous in the way they have been flooded (yes, flooded) by refugees. Nation states with porous borders, located in areas of regional conflict, have had to live for generations with the movement of displaced peoples. But {{it seems to be a}} golden rule that the richer the country, the more pinched it becomes. Australia, land of amoral mining advocates and rising living prices, couldn’t care a fig. Distance doesn’t so much make the heart grow fonder but harder. It also makes it more irrational. Any visitor to Australia will be struck by how beset it is by worry. If it isn’t the stream of insurance advertisements concerning what to do with the funeral expenses heaped upon the living by the dearly departed (“No worries, we got it covered!”), it’s the barrage of militant metaphors about invasion. Paradise is under siege, and those haphazard boats with human cargo are to blame. Over the weekend, Home Affairs Minister Jason Clare <b>was</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the Australian public had been having a ‘gut full’ (a nice visceral metaphor) at the dangers occasioned by travelling to Australia, until one realised that he was merely concerned about them coming here at all. If they drown, the Australian conscience is pricked. Such a conscience is bound to be spared if these “arrivals” are decent enough to pack up and head to Pacific processing centres. An expert panel was recently appointed to examine the situation of increased arrivals, suggesting that expertise is required to deal with this “problem”, one so grave it threatens Australia’s existence. That it was headed by Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston was itself a worry. “We recommend a policy approach that is hard headed but not hard-hearted… if this package is embraced by the government and implemented it will start to have an effect fairly quickly. ” The recommendations are intentionally mixed, taking swipes at each position that has been taken on refugees from the Greens to the conservative Coalition. The Houston panel, also consisting of Michael L’Estrange and Paris Aristotle, suggests increasing the humanitarian intake from the current 13, 750 to 20, 000, a position that the Gillard government has baulked at previously. Processing centres are to be opened at Manus Island in Papua New Guinea and Nauru, both suggestions that might well be shot down in flames by a High Court challenge. It is worth noting that the panel sees an expansion of this network of processing centres – a trans-Pacific network of facilities built with the express purpose of preventing refugees from arriving on Australian shores. The desperation of the Gillard government is such that they accepted, even in advance, all 22 recommendations of the panel. This is the Pacific Solution redux, an Orwellian, perhaps even Havel-like farce. Ever since the odious dealings with the MV Tampa in August 2001, when the Howard government deployed SAS personnel against 400 asylum seekers off Christmas Island, boat arrivals have been packaged with the rhetorical material of terror, disease and revolt. Military vessels have been employed to deal with the arrivals, suggesting that such citizens are to be treated in the manner befitting any invasion force. They are to be “processed”, preferably somewhere far from Australia. (Quarantine is not something restricted to the introduction of food and plant matter.) The Australian opposition has been smug to the recommendations of the panel. Nauru is the way to go, while Malaysia is not, or, as opposition immigration spokesman Scott Morrison put it, “The Houston panel has green-lighted Nauru, and they have red-lighted Malaysia. ” The awful premise of off-shore processing, suggesting the innate terror of the political establishment to assess claims in Australia, has been further entrenched in the Houston panel. What the Houston panel does is simply reiterate the long standing argument that those who are willing to perish on route should be punished for even considering the option of coming to Australia by boat. Distractions are offered in debate – straw men such as ‘people traffickers’ and ‘people smugglers’ are erected in order to be easily battered down. Random figures are drawn out of a hat – it might be the UNHCR-mandated spots for 6000 people detained in refugee camps across the globe, or the 7500 arrivals this year who terrify such papers as The Australian (Aug 14) into thinking that “orderly” resettlement will be impossible. Such terms mean little in the context of the refugee debate. What matters here is how institutions punish the cargo, not the carrier. To take this flawed logic further, the slave trader, while considered despicable, is less invidious than the slave who was silly enough to become a chattel in the first place. No side in Australian politics is willing to accept the core premise that the refugees will not stop arriving and will not be “turned back”. Global conflicts and immigration routes are such that Australia is not the sylvan idyll beyond reach, a paradisiacal retreat that only those born first in a lottery can savour. Australia will be reached, and the only solution is to find a measure of humanitarian worth that dignifies, rather than disgraces the situation at hand. It is the refusal not merely to accept that task but implement it, that reeks. Whatever the panel and whatever the recommendation, these people are not wanted, and that is just about the only thing that Australian politicians agree about. • Binoy Kampmark was a Commonwealth Scholar at Selwyn College, Cambridge.
