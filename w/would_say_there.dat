2500|$|Henry Hart's {{original}} colored minstrels {{gave the}} best entertainment {{of the kind}} last Friday night ever put on the boards in this city. Their representation of the Southern plantation negro's is without precedent. To the lovers of [...] "burnt cork" [...] everywhere we <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> <b>there</b> is nothing of vulgarity or low slang in the performances of this troupe to give offence to the most fastidious of refined society.|$|E
2500|$|In a January 2016 interview, Shawn Ryan blamed {{personality}} {{clashes with}} the network: [...] "The official answer is they decided they liked other pilots better. If {{you look at}} what pilots they picked up that year, I think that's kind of incredible. I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> were a lot of 400 lb. gorillas involved in the show and sometimes the gorillas don’t always get along.". He also said that he was very proud of the pilot and loved working with Murphy.|$|E
5000|$|I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>there's</b> a {{large body}} of writing on nature that is inaccurate, that sentimentalises nature, {{interpreting}} nature in a way that suits the writer...The facts are subjugated by the writer's feelings. But my writing is in the poetry of fact. This is not a shallow piece of study. I have found almost every paper on the subject in the English language.|$|R

2500|$|At 12:54, the {{co-pilot}} visually {{picked up}} the runway to his right. The co-pilot prompted the PIC to go towards the runway on the right at 12:54:15 saying [...] "runway in sight, nothing there, only radar shows...‟ He repeated [...] "Go to the right, I <b>would</b> <b>say,</b> <b>there</b> is nothing there‟. At 12:54:35, he again said [...] "that is, that is, that is, runway in sight, there is nothing there‟ the co-pilot reiterated [...] "Well, that is, don't you see…‟ It was at this stage that the Captain also saw the runway because immediately thereafter, he disengaged the autopilot to start a turn towards the runway and acknowledged to the co-pilot {{that he had the}} runway in sight.|$|E
2500|$|Salk {{preferred}} not to have {{his career as a}} scientist affected by too much personal attention, as he had always tried to remain independent and private in his research and life, but this proved to be impossible. [...] "Young man, a great tragedy has befallen you—you've lost your anonymity", the television personality Ed Murrow said to Salk shortly after the onslaught of media attention. When Murrow asked him, [...] "Who owns this patent?", Salk replied, [...] "Well, the people I <b>would</b> <b>say.</b> <b>There</b> is no patent. Could you patent the sun?" [...] The vaccine is calculated to be worth $7 billion had it been patented. However, lawyers from the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis did look into the possibility of a patent, but ultimately determined that the vaccine was not a patentable invention because of prior art.|$|E
2500|$|Salk {{campaigned for}} {{mandatory}} vaccination, claiming that public health {{should be considered}} a [...] "moral commitment." [...] His sole focus had been to develop a safe and effective vaccine as rapidly as possible, with no interest in personal profit. When asked who owned the patent to it, Salk said, [...] "Well, the people I <b>would</b> <b>say.</b> <b>There</b> is no patent. Could you patent the sun?" [...] In 1960, he founded the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California, which is today a center for medical and scientific research. He continued to conduct research and publish books, including Man Unfolding (1972), The Survival of the Wisest (1973), World Population and Human Values: A New Reality (1981), and Anatomy of Reality: Merging of Intuition and Reason (1983). Salk's last years were spent searching for a vaccine against HIV. His personal papers are stored at the University of California, San Diego Library.|$|E

"Mister Cattley," [...] {{interrupted}} Willie, [...] "if you'll allow a partic'larly humble {{individual to}} make a observation, I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>there's</b> nothin' in life to prevent me from keeping this 'ere fairy company till you come back.

2500|$|Mack was {{somewhat}} more guarded in his investigations and {{interpretations of the}} abduction phenomenon than were earlier researchers. Literature professor Terry Matheson writes that [...] "On balance, Mack does present as fair-minded an account as has been encountered to date, at least as these abduction narratives go." [...] In a 1994 interview, [...] Jeffrey Mishlove stated that Mack seemed [...] "inclined to take these [...] reports at face value". Mack replied by saying [...] "Face value I wouldn't say. I take them seriously. I don't {{have a way to}} account for them." [...] Similarly, the BBC quoted Mack as saying, [...] "I would never say, yes, there are aliens taking people. [...] I <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> is a compelling powerful phenomenon here that I can't account for in any other way, that's mysterious. Yet I can't know what it is {{but it seems to me}} that it invites a deeper, further inquiry." ...|$|E
2500|$|In The Deadly Assassin (1976), the Fourth Doctor {{states that}} Time Lords {{are limited to}} twelve regenerations, {{implying}} a total of thirteen incarnations. This statement is later repeated in [...] "Mawdryn Undead", the 1996 TV film and [...] "The Time of the Doctor". This aspect became embedded in the public consciousness despite not often being repeated, and was recognised by producers of the show as a plot obstacle for when the show finally had to regenerate the Doctor a thirteenth time. [...] The BBC's Series 4 FAQ suggested that since the Time Lords {{were believed to be}} dead and their rules destroyed, the Doctor may be able to regenerate indefinitely: [...] "Now that his people are gone, who knows? Time Lords used to have thirteen lives." [...] In [...] "Death of the Doctor" [...] (a 2010 The Sarah Jane Adventures serial), the Eleventh Doctor says he can regenerate 507 times (early news reports, before the episode was broadcast, suggested he <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> is no limit to the number of regenerations). However, writer Russell T Davies explained in an interview with SFX that this line was not intended to be taken seriously and insisted that the [...] "thirteen lives" [...] rule was too deeply entrenched in the viewer consciousness for his throwaway line to affect it.|$|E

25|$|Whereas legal {{positivism}} <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that a law can be unjust {{without it}} being any less a law, a natural law jurisprudence <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that <b>there</b> is something legally deficient about an unjust norm.

6000|$|Weissmann did not {{smile as}} Serviss had expected. He became grave. [...] "I am not {{qualified}} to judge.

6000|$|Indeed, {{some thought}} that the brave boy boasted a little; but one must indeed believe him since he said so himself.

60|$|I {{have not}} the least belief in the awful unseen world being {{available}} for evening parties at so much per night; and, although I {{should be ready to}} receive enlightenment from any source, I must say I have very little hope of it from the spirits who express themselves through mediums, as I have never yet observed them to talk anything but nonsense, of which (as Carlyle <b>would</b> <b>say)</b> <b>there</b> is probably enough in these days of ours, and in all days, among mere mortality.|$|E
60|$|There were lucid {{intervals}} {{in which}} Lord Byron felt {{the charm of}} his wife's mind, {{and the strength of}} her powers. 'Bell, you could be a poet too, if you only thought so,' he <b>would</b> <b>say.</b> <b>There</b> were summer-hours in her stormy life, the memory of which never left her, when Byron was as gentle and tender as he was beautiful; when he seemed to be possessed by a good angel: and then for a little time all the ideal possibilities of his nature stood revealed.|$|E
