This paper examines productivity measurement in markets with market power and restrictive <b>work</b> rules: <b>rules</b> that induce wages {{to be paid for}} non-productive labor hours. It develops a theoretical model to explain why workers would want restrictive <b>work</b> <b>rules</b> and how competition leads to their reduction. I model a monopoly firm whose workers dictate wages and <b>work</b> <b>rules.</b> <b>Work</b> <b>rules</b> allow workers to maintain both high levels of employment and wages.

The purpose of this survey was to obtain basic information about the organization of industrial relations in engineering workshops classified by section of industry, size and region. The survey was designed to elucidate procedural arrangements on combinations of trade unions {{to be found in}} engineering workshops, on numbers of shop stewards, on the types of agreement entered into on <b>works</b> <b>rules</b> and on negotiating and consultative machinery. Main Topics : Written agreements on wages and conditions of work, whether records of meetings are kept, agreements made by manual workers in past 5 years, source of advice sought for a variety of changes, whether manual workers have same conditions as other staff. Assessment of relations with manual worker/staff trade unions. Written <b>works</b> <b>rules</b> for manual/staff employees, type of trade unions in firm and estimated membership, number of shop stewards and staff worker representatives. Conditions of trade union membership, whether new workers encouraged to join union, policy towards and perceived advantages of 'closed shop'. Shop stewards: method of appointment, management objections to appointments (reasons), basis for payment, facilities and arrangements for meetings. Whether manual workers take part in joint shop steward committees. Written procedure agreement (except 1922 Procedure Agreement-Manual Workers) and any other written procedures and main problems, number of stoppages/other actions during last 2 years, whether informal discussions with workers and/or shop stewards take place. Number of conferences held during last 2 years, opinion on legalisation of procedure agreements (type of sanctions, responsibility for sanctions). Details of other workplace committees and arrangements, manual workers' opinions of trade unions/payment problems were explored in detail, most important functions of the Local Engineering Employers' Association. Autonomy of supervisors, national agreements followed by manual workers, whether firm is single or multi-establishment, whether personnel staff employed (details of duties), normal chief representatives of management at conferences, method of contact with local Engineering Employers' Association. If multi-establishment: headquarters arrangements for industrial relations purpose, autonomy of respondent's branch of firm.

40|$|LL. M. (Banking Law) Abstract: The {{increased}} use of settling transactions on an open account 1 in international trade, the pressures to reduce costs, improve efficiencies and the inevitable move to utilise electronic processes {{has resulted in a}} need for a new solution for the payment of transactions between importers/buyers and exporters/sellers. 2 Bank payment obligations (BPOs), the solution developed by the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) 3 and the Banking Commission of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), are irrevocable undertakings given by an obligor bank to a recipient bank to pay a specified amount on the condition of a successful electronic matching of data or acceptance of mismatches. 4 BPOs are distinct from the traditional methods relied on by importers and exporters as the terms of engagement are based on an agreed event referred to as a baseline and the technical matching of data generated by SWIFT’s transaction-matching application referred to as Trade Services Utility. This dissertation focuses on the manner in which a BPO is established and structured, the legal obligations of the parties, specifically the banks, and establishing liability between the parties outside of the BPO. The BPO was implemented to cater for the needs of the importers and exporters and to provide an efficient means of settling transactions. However, this payment method has not gained the desired traction within local trade sectors or the banking sectors. This dissertation explores the reasons why this payment method has not gained the expected acceptance from financial institutions or the main parties to import or export transactions. The information gathered and reviewed pertains mainly to literature in the form of published <b>works,</b> <b>rules</b> developed specifically for trade instruments, articles, case studies and guidelines published or made available by the ICC...|$|E
40|$|CONTENT: Why {{is it that}} in {{worldwide}} testing, in the past, the Japanese usually surpass the Americans {{when it comes to}} subjects such as math and language skills? "The challenge to industrial America lies primarily in the Japanese classroom rather than in the factory''. This quote is from Benjamin Duke's book The Japanese School and states that the success of the Japanese stems from their educational system. What the Japanese can teach us, and what differences they have in their curriculum as well as in their culture, is something which needs to be explored. Many different aspects to the traditional Japanese curriculum differ from the American one. One of these things are the subjects that are being taught such as teaching Japanese as the National Language. Math is also {{a big part of the}} Japanese student's life inside and outside of school. Math standards have been set for the different grade levels, so that every student is held to standards with their surrounding classmates. The other aspect that contributes to this academic success of the Japanese is the differences in culture between the two societies. These differences include the idea of uniformity, personal pride (ganbare), and the culture's child rearing practices. The traditional educational system in Japan is all run under the Ministry of Education in that all the books are chosen by that committee along with course <b>works,</b> <b>rules,</b> and regulations. This creates a national curriculum with standards that need to be met by all students attending that particular school and an atmosphere that is very structured and gives little room for deviation from the curriculum. My focus will be primarily on the differences between the traditional Japanese school system and the effects that their cultural values and norms has on its students. I will talk about the positive aspects that we could learn from this system, although I do understand the negative aspects as well. RATIONALE: I plan to go about my thesis by first researching the way a typical school day in Japan is run. Then I will focus on some studies done on international testing, and obtain some statistics to first prove my thesis is true that the Japanese are doing something differently than the Americans to maintain these impressive test scores. Once that is complete, I will be able to look at the differences in curriculum and in culture and give examples of ways in which we can improve our educational system as well as provide information on what the Japanese could learn from the Americans as well. OBJECTIVES: My thesis will explore the positive aspects of the Japanese educational system. I will also want to focus on some teaching methodologies as well as a brief page or so on some of the things that the Japanese can learn from the Americans...|$|E
