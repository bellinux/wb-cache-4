25|$|When {{he first}} arrived in Paris, he wrote home {{regularly}} to his mother, he sketched his nudes at the Académie Colarossi, and he drank wine in moderation. He {{was at that time}} considered by those who knew him as a bit reserved, verging on the asocial. He is noted to have commented, upon meeting Picasso who, at the time, was wearing his trademark workmen's clothes, that even though the man <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>genius,</b> that did not excuse his uncouth appearance.|$|E
25|$|Naas Botha was, without doubt, {{the most}} {{controversial}} Northerns hero ever, because no-one was ever neutral about him. People either loved him or loved to hate him. Just like his predecessor, Hannes Brewis, Botha <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>genius</b> at fly-half and the great points machine. Amongst all true Northerns supporters, {{he was one of}} the greatest heroes of all time, however outside Northern Transvaal he was hated, because the supporters of other teams feared him. Botha's popularity was mainly due to his excellence with the boot. He was the greatest match winner SA rugby has ever seen and has a record that speaks for itself. Botha was fetched by Buurman van Zyl from the Tukkies under-20 team, and included him as a 19-year old in the most successful side of the 1970s. It was also Oom Buurman who chose him as captain of the Blue Bulls in 1980 over many other more senior players like Daan du Plessis, Jan Oberholzster and Louis Moolman. His great claim to fame came on the 1981 tour to New Zealand where he had the local public in canter. He was an absolute genius and his insight into and knowledge of the game and its rules, and his ability to motivate players, made him the ideal player-captain. Botha would probably have rewritten the record books far more often had it not been for apartheid, which robbed him of the opportunity to play regular test rugby. He was both a brilliant kicker and a true strategist. He received the SA Rugby Player of the Year award a record 4 times (1979, 1981, 1985 and 1987).|$|E
500|$|Kulwicki {{started his}} rookie season in 1986 with Terry. After Terry decided to end support for his racing team mid-season, Kulwicki fielded his own team. He started out as {{essentially}} a one-man team {{in a time when}} other teams had dozens of people in supporting roles. Initially the driver, owner, crew chief, and chief mechanic, Kulwicki had difficulty acquiring and keeping crew members because he found it difficult to trust them to do the job with the excellence that he demanded, and because he was hands on in the maintenance of racecars {{to the point of being}} a [...] "control freak". He sought out crew members who had owned their own racecars, believing they would understand what he was going through: working long hours and performing his own car maintenance with a very limited budget. Notable crew members include his crew chief, Paul Andrews, and future Cup crew chiefs, Tony Gibson and Brian Whitesell. Future crew chief and owner, Ray Evernham, lasted sixweeks with Kulwicki in 1992. Evernham later said, [...] "The man <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>genius.</b> There's no question. It's not a matter of people just feeling like he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>genius.</b> That man <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>genius.</b> But his personality paid for that. He was very impatient, very straightforward, very cut-to-the-bone." [...] With onecar, twoengines, and twofull-time crew members, Kulwicki won the 1986 Winston Cup Rookie of the Year award. He had competed in 23 of 29events, with fourtop10 finishes, three races not completed (DNF), an average finish of 15.4, and had only one result below 30th place. Kulwicki finished 21st in the Winston Cup points standings for the season.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} [...] "Release" [...] was {{developed}} by Shiban, who handed the script over to Amann. The character of Rudolph Hayes was crafted to be an ambiguous character: either he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>genius</b> who was adept at solving crime, comparable to Sherlock Holmes, or he was a criminal mastermind, like Professor Moriarty. The final scene, featuring Doggett scattering his son's ashes, was difficult for Patrick to film, but thanks to Manners' help, {{he was able to}} achieve the desired effect.|$|E
500|$|In {{retirement}} Molotov remained unrepentant {{about his}} role under Stalin's rule. He {{suffered a heart attack}} in January 1962. After the Sino-Soviet split, it was reported that he agreed with the criticisms made by Mao Zedong of the supposed [...] "revisionism" [...] of Khrushchev's policies. According to Roy Medvedev, Stalin's daughter Svetlana Alliluyeva recalled Molotov's wife telling her: [...] "Your father <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>genius.</b> There's no revolutionary spirit around nowadays, just opportunism everywhere" [...] and [...] "China's our only hope.

500|$|The {{news of the}} {{assassination}} of Abraham Lincoln on 15 April, 1865 caused demonstrations of sorrow in Sydney. An editorial in Melbourne's [...] "The Age" [...] newspaper on June 27, 1865 reported that in Sydney {{the assassination}} of Lincoln had caused great indignation. There were many Australian sympathisers that wanted {{to put an end}} to slavery, a central issue with Lincoln and his Emancipation Proclamation. A memorial service was held in Sydney's Prince of Wales Opera House on Sunday afternoon July 9, 1865. There were strong feelings of anger at public meetings against the killer of Lincoln, a person so dedicated to his country. They figured he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>genius</b> who rose [...] "from a log cabin to the White House." ...|$|E

500|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of Cosima's death, some writers heaped copious praise on her. Ernest Newman, Wagner's biographer, called her [...] "the greatest figure that ever came within [...] circle"; Richard du Moulin Eckart, Cosima's first biographer, introduced her as [...] "the greatest woman of the century". In time judgements became more measured, and divided. Marek closes his account by emphasising her role not only as Wagner's protector but as his muse: [...] "Without her {{there would have been no}} Siegfried Idyll, no Bayreuth, and no Parsifal". In Hensher's judgement, [...] "Wagner <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>genius,</b> but also a fairly appalling human being. Cosima was just an appalling human being." [...] In 1977, 47 years after her death, Cosima's urn was recovered from Coburg and buried alongside Wagner in the Wahnfried garden.|$|E
500|$|In 1968, Wright {{commented on}} Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: [...] "It's {{hard to see}} why we were cast as the first British {{psychedelic}} group. We never saw ourselves that way... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted... the emphasis... firmly on spontaneity and improvisation." [...] Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: [...] "There wasn't anything 'grand' about it. We were laughable. We were useless. We couldn't play at all so we had to do something stupid and 'experimental'...Syd <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>genius,</b> but I wouldn't {{want to go back to}} playing [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] for hours and hours." [...] Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|In February 1974, Drake {{contacted}} John Wood, stating he {{was ready}} to begin work on a fourth album. Boyd was in England at the time, and agreed to attend the recordings. The initial session was followed by further recordings in July. In his 2006 autobiography, the producer recalled being taken aback at Drake's anger and bitterness: [...] " [...] I had told him he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>genius,</b> and others had concurred. Why wasn't he famous and rich? This rage must have festered beneath that inexpressive exterior for years." [...] Both Boyd and Wood noticed a discernible deterioration in Drake's performance, requiring him to overdub his voice separately over the guitar. However, the return to Sound Techniques' studio raised Drake's spirits; his mother later recalled, [...] "We were so absolutely thrilled to think that Nick was happy because there hadn't been any happiness in Nick's life for years." ...|$|E

500|$|Stengel {{was both}} manager and an {{investor}} in the Braves. In his six years there, 1938 to 1943, his team never {{finished in the}} top half of the league standings, and the Boston club finished seventh four straight years between 1939 and 1942, saved from last place by the fact that the Phillies were even worse. The entry of the United States in World War II meant that many top players went into the service, but for the Braves, the changeover made little difference in the standings. Among the young players to join the Braves was pitcher Warren Spahn, who was sent down to the minor leagues by the manager for having [...] "no heart". Spahn, who would go on to a Hall of Fame career, much of it with the Braves, would play again for Stengel on the woeful New York Mets in 1965, and joke that he was the only person [...] to play for Stengel both before and after he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>genius.</b>|$|E
