25|$|American pragmatists distrusted {{the notion}} of the {{absolute}} and instead recognized {{the notion of}} free will. Rather than God’s divine intervention taking control of the happenings of the universe, pragmatism believed that people, using their free <b>will,</b> <b>shape</b> the institutions of society. Veblen also recognized this as an element of causes and effects, upon which he based many of his theories. This pragmatist belief was pertinent to the shaping of Veblen’s critique of natural law and the establishment of his evolutionary economics, which recognized the purpose of man throughout.|$|E

500|$|In British Archaeology magazine, Aston was {{described}} as [...] "the Mortimer Wheeler of our times" [...] because, despite strong differences between their personalities, both had done much to bring archaeology to the British public. It went on to note that Aston reminded archaeologists that [...] "their job is to do archaeology, and if that was an archaeology that meant nothing to ordinary people, {{there was no point}} in it – and government would be among the first to notice." [...] Two of Aston's colleagues from Bristol University, Stuart Prior and Mark Horton, commented that [...] "Mick brought archaeology into the living rooms of half the nation, and left a legacy that <b>will</b> <b>shape</b> the discipline for decades to come." [...] Writing for the website of Antiquity, Christopher Gerrard described him as [...] "perhaps the best known face in British archaeology", adding that [...] "in so many different areas of medieval archaeology his legacy will live on". Emma McFarnon described Aston as [...] "Somerset's premier archaeologist" [...] in her obituary on the This is Somerset website.|$|E
500|$|In critiquing {{the rise}} of Internet-based computing, the {{philosophical}} {{question of whether or}} not a society can control technological progress was raised. At the online scientific magazine Edge, Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger argued that individual will was all that was necessary to maintain the cognitive capacity to read a book all the way through, and computer scientist and writer Jaron Lanier rebuked the idea that technological progress is an [...] "autonomous process that will proceed in its chosen direction independently of us". Lanier echoed a view stated by American historian Lewis Mumford in his 1970 book The Pentagon of Power, in which Mumford suggested that the technological advances that shape a society could be controlled if the full might of a society's free will were employed. Lanier believed that technology was significantly hindered by the idea that [...] "there is only one axis of choice" [...] which is either pro- or anti- when it comes to technology adoption. Yet Carr had stated in The Big Switch that he believed an individual's personal choice toward a technology had little effect on technological progress. According to Carr, the view expressed by Mumford about technological progress was incorrect because it regarded technology solely as advances in science and engineering rather than as an influence on the costs of production and consumption. Economics were a more significant consideration in Carr's opinion because in a competitive marketplace the most efficient methods of providing an important resource will prevail. As technological advances shape society, an individual might be able to resist the effects but his lifestyle will [...] "always be lonely and in the end futile"; despite a few holdouts, technology will nevertheless shape economics which, in turn, <b>will</b> <b>shape</b> society.|$|E

2500|$|Attachment in {{children}} is [...] "a biological instinct in which proximity to an attachment figure is sought {{when the child}} senses or perceives threat or discomfort.

Childhood attachment can define characteristics that <b>will</b> <b>shape</b> the child's sense of self, their forms of emotion-regulation, and how they carry out relationships with others.

50|$|The musicians {{with whom}} Jayne Cortez aligned herself {{reflected}} the sociopolitical and cultural elements {{to which she}} attached the greatest importance.

Early exposure to the recordings of Bessie Smith instilled in Cortez a deeply etched sense of female identity, which, combined with a strong <b>will,</b> <b>shaped</b> her into an uncommonly outspoken individual. She became transformed by the sounds of Duke Ellington, Sarah Vaughan, Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and no-nonsense vocalist Dinah Washington, whose visceral approach to self-expression clearly encouraged the poet not to pull any punches.|$|R
