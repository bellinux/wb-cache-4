Lord Caradon said [...] "It {{has been said that}} in the Resolution we treated Palestinians only as refugees, but this is unjustified. <b>We</b> <b>provided</b> that Israel should withdraw from occupied territories and it was together with that requirement for a restoration of Arab territory that we also called for a settlement of the refugee problem." [...] Upon the adoption of Resolution 242, French President Charles de Gaulle stressed this principle during a press conference on November 27, 1967 and confirmed it in his letter of January 9, 1968 to David Ben-Gurion. De Gaulle cited [...] "the pitiful condition of the Arabs who had sought refuge in Jordan or were relegated to Gaza" [...] and stated that provided Israel withdrew her forces, it appeared {{it would be possible to}} reach a solution [...] "within the framework of the United Nations that included the assurance of a dignified and fair future for the refugees and minorities in the Middle East." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{those days}} he was troubled with sleeplessness, or, rather, with {{reluctant}} sleepiness, {{and he had}} various specifics for promoting it. At first it had been champagne just before going to bed, and <b>we</b> <b>provided</b> that, but later he appeared from Boston with four bottles of lager-beer under his arms; lager-beer, he said now, {{was the only thing}} to make you go to sleep, and <b>we</b> <b>provided</b> that. Still later, on a visit I paid him at Hartford, I learned that hot Scotch was the only soporific worth considering, and Scotch-whiskey duly found its place on our sideboard. One day, very long afterward, I asked him if he were still taking hot Scotch to make him sleep. He said he was not taking anything. For a while he had found going to bed on the bath-room floor a soporific; then one night he went to rest in his own bed at ten o'clock, and had gone promptly to sleep without anything. He had done the like with the like effect ever since. Of course, it amused him; there were few experiences of life, grave or gay, which did not amuse him, even when they wronged him.|$|E

60|$|The {{next morning}} I {{found myself in}} a quandary.

I concluded at last to take him; it would be awkward to leave him behind, and he might be of use. <b>We</b> <b>provided</b> ourselves with fishing rods and tackle and two pairs of wading-boots, as well as with a luncheon basket, well filled by Mrs. Jabe, and started on our expedition.

60|$|It {{had been}} some time already {{that we had been}} used to tread barefooted upon the rocks, the gravel, the grass, and the sand on the shore; but as we found the worst thing for our feet was the walking or {{travelling}} on the dry burning sands, within the country, so <b>we</b> <b>provided</b> ourselves with a sort of shoes, made of the skins of wild beasts, with the hair inward, and being dried in the sun, the outsides were thick and hard, and would last a great while. In short, as I called them, so I think the term very proper still, we made us gloves for our feet, and we found them very convenient and very comfortable.|$|E
60|$|I {{have more}} than once {{referred}} to our goods. Perhaps it may be as well to explain that, when we first landed on the African coast, we made inquiries {{of those who were}} best acquainted with the nature and requirements of the country we were about to explore, as to what goods we ought to purchase of the traders, in order {{to be in a position}} to pay our way as we went along; for we could not, of course, expect the savages to feed us and lodge us and help us on our way for nothing. After mature consideration, <b>we</b> <b>provided</b> ourselves with a supply of such things as were most necessary and suitable--such as tobacco, powder, and shot, and ball, a few trade-guns, several pieces of brightly-coloured cloth, packages of beads (some white enamelled, others of coloured glass), coffee and tea, knives, scissors, rings, and a variety of other knick-knacks. These, with a little brandy to be used medicinally, our blankets and camp cooking utensils, formed a heavy load for ten men; but, of course, as we advanced, the load was lightened by the consumption of our provisions and the giving away of goods. The additions which I made, however, in the shape of stuffed specimens, began in the course of time to more than counterbalance this advantage.|$|E

6000|$|In {{the end you}} {{are forced}} to ask the {{question}} you should have asked at the beginning. What do you give a man an income for? Obviously to keep him alive. Since it is evident that the first condition on which he can be kept alive without enslaving somebody else is that he shall produce an equivalent for what it costs to keep him alive, we may quite rationally compel him to abstain from idling by whatever means we employ to compel him to abstain from murder, arson, forgery, or any other crime. The one supremely foolish thing to do with him is to do nothing; that is, to be as idle, lazy, and heartless in dealing with him as he is in dealing with us. Even if <b>we</b> <b>provided</b> work for him instead of basing, as we do, our whole industrial system on successive competitive waves of overwork with their ensuing troughs of unemployment, we should still sternly deny him the alternative of not doing it; for the result must be that he will become poor and make his children poor if he has any; and poor people are cancers in the commonwealth, costing far more than if they were handsomely pensioned off as incurables. Jesus had more sense than to propose anything of the sort. He said to his disciples, in effect, [...] "Do your work for love; and let the other people lodge and feed and clothe you for love." [...] Or, as we should put it nowadays, [...] "for nothing." [...] All human experience and all natural uncommercialized human aspiration point to this as the right path. The Greeks said, [...] "First secure an independent income; and then practise virtue." [...] We all strive towards an independent income. We all know as well as Jesus did that if we have to take thought for the morrow as to whether there shall be anything to eat or drink it will be impossible for us to think of nobler things, or live a higher life than that of a mole, whose life is from beginning to end a frenzied pursuit of food. Until the community is organized {{in such a way that}} the fear of bodily want is forgotten as completely as the fear of wolves already is in civilized capitals, we shall never have a decent social life. Indeed the whole attraction of our present arrangements lies in the fact that they do relieve a handful of us from this fear; but as the relief is effected stupidly and wickedly by making the favored handful parasitic on the rest, they are smitten with the degeneracy which seems to be the inevitable biological penalty of complete parasitism, and corrupt culture and statecraft instead of contributing to them, their excessive leisure being as mischievous as the excessive toil of the laborers. Anyhow, the moral is clear. The two main problems of organized society, how to secure the subsistence of all its members, and how to prevent the theft of that subsistence by idlers, should be entirely dissociated; and the practical failure of one of them to automatically achieve the other recognized and acted on. We may not all have Jesus's psychological power of seeing, without any enlightenment from more modern economic phenomena, that they must fail; but we have the hard fact before us that they do fail. The only people who cling to the lazy delusion that it is possible to find a just distribution that will work automatically are those who postulate some revolutionary change like land nationalization, which by itself would obviously only force into greater urgency the problem of how to distribute the product of the land among all the individuals in the community.|$|E
