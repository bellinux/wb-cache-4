5|$|Collectively, Hygrophoropsis is a {{widespread}} genus, found in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca is the most widely distributed species, found on several continents. The other species are not well-known and have more limited ranges. Fruit bodies grow {{on the ground in}} woodlands, on moss, and peat, and on <b>woodchips.</b> Hygrophoropsis is a saprophytic genus, and causes brown rot in the wood it colonises. Some species may be facultatively mycorrhizal.|$|E
5|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1987 and became a public company in 1999. It {{expanded}} its MIS business rapidly in the 2000s, supported by favourable tax regulations for these types of investments. Most of the Group's business was in plantation forestry to supply <b>woodchips</b> for the pulp and paper industry, but in the 2000s it diversified into high-value timbers, beef cattle, olives, viticulture, and almond production. The company's after-tax profit peaked at A$132 million in 2006, but by 2008 had deteriorated to a A$63 million loss.|$|E
5|$|There are 16 {{accepted}} {{species of}} Hygrophoropsis, found {{in both the}} Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Hygrophoropsis is a saprophytic genus that causes brown rot in the wood it colonises. The fruit bodies grow {{on the ground in}} woodlands, on moss, peat, and on <b>woodchips.</b> They are convex to infundibuliform (funnel-shaped) and have decurrent, forked brightly colored gills. The spores are dextrinoid, meaning that they stain reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent. Because H.aurantiaca has orange gills, it has been mistaken for a chanterelle, and hence it has been called a false chanterelle.|$|E

50|$|During {{the late}} 1960s and '70s the high demand for {{paper and the}} {{relatively}} low cost and availability of the native forests made {{the establishment of a}} <b>woodchipping</b> industry a viable proposition.

40|$|Journal articleLand {{application}} of dairy soiled water (DSW) is expensive relative to its nutrient replacement value. The use of aerobic filters {{is an effective}} alternative method of treatment and potentially allows the final effluent to be reused on the farm. Knowledge gaps exist concerning the optimal design and operation of filters {{for the treatment of}} DSW. To address this, 18 laboratory-scale filters, with depths of either 0. 6 m or 1 m, were intermittently loaded with DSW over periods of up to 220 days to evaluate the impacts of depth (0. 6 m versus 1 m), organic loading rates (OLRs) (50 versus 155 g COD m- 2 d- 1), and media type (<b>woodchip</b> versus sand) on organic, nutrient and suspended solids (SS) removals. The study found that media depth was important in contaminant removal in <b>woodchip</b> filters. Reductions of 78 % chemical oxygen demand (COD), 95 % SS, 85 % total nitrogen (TN), 82 % ammonium-nitrogen (NH 4 -N), 50 % total phosphorus (TP), and 54 % dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) were measured in 1 m deep <b>woodchip</b> filters, which was greater than the reductions in 0. 6 m deep <b>woodchip</b> filters. <b>Woodchip</b> filters also performed optimally when loaded at a high OLR (155 g COD m- 2 d- 1), although the removal mechanism was primarily physical (i. e. straining) as opposed to biological. When operated at the same OLR and when of the same depth, the sand filters had better COD removals (96 %) than <b>woodchip</b> (74 %), but {{there was no significant difference}} between them in the removal of SS and NH 4 -N. However, the likelihood of clogging makes sand filters less desirable than <b>woodchip</b> filters. Using the optimal designs of both configurations, the filter area required per cow for a <b>woodchip</b> filter is more than four times less than for a sand filter. Therefore, this study found that <b>woodchip</b> filters are more economically and environmentally effective in the treatment of DSW than sand filters, and optimal performance may be achieved using <b>woodchip</b> filters with a depth of at least 1 m, operated at an OLR of 155 g COD m- 2 d- 1.

5|$|A {{predominantly}} saprophytic species, Morchella rufobrunnea fruit bodies grow singly or {{in clusters}} in disturbed soil or <b>woodchips</b> used in landscaping. Large numbers can appear {{the year after}} wood mulch has been spread on the ground. Typical disturbed habitats include fire pits, near compost piles, logging roads, and dirt basements. Fruiting usually occurs in the spring, although fruit bodies {{can be found in}} these habitats most of the year. Other preferred habitats include steep slopes and plateaus, and old-growth conifer forests. In Cyprus, the fungus is frequently reported from coastal, urban and suburban areas under olive trees (Olea europaea).|$|E
5|$|Several {{characters}} {{serve to}} help distinguish Parasola auricoma from similar coprinoid mushrooms that grow in <b>woodchips,</b> including {{a lack of}} deliquescence, {{and the lack of}} a veil. Microscopically, it is characterized by the long, gold-pigmented, thick-walled setae on the cap, and ellipsoid spores with a germ pore. The distinctly grooved and pleated cap margin indicates that it is allied with the coprinoid species and not with the genus Psathyrella. Similar Parasola species include the common and widespread P.plicatilis, P.leiocephala, P.lilatincta, and P.kuehneri. Only microscopy will definitively separate these from P.auricomaâ€”none of them have setae on the cap.|$|E
5|$|Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca is {{a widely}} {{distributed}} species. In Europe and North America, it is found in both hardwood and conifer forests, as well as heathland, in summer and autumn. In Mexico, it is common in coniferous forests. It fruits from the ground or from decaying wood, on burned areas in forests, and is often found near fallen trees and tree stumps. The fungus can also grow on <b>woodchips</b> used in gardening and landscaping, and so it also appears on roadsides and other locations where this material is used. Fruit bodies occur singly to scattered, or in clusters, and can be very abundant. Generally considered a dry weather mushroom, it can be plentiful when other mushrooms are scarce. Other locations where the false chanterelle has been recorded include Africa, Central and South America, northern Asia, Australia and New Zealand. Populations in California represent a complex of undescribed species that are collectively referred to as Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca sensu lato.|$|E

5|$|The male red-tailed black {{cockatoo}} courts by puffing up crest and cheek feathers, {{and hiding}} the beak; it then sings and struts, {{ending in a}} jump and a flash of red tail feathers toward the female who will most often reply by defensively biting him. Breeding generally takes place from May to September except {{in the case of}} the South-eastern subspecies, which nests during summer (December to February). Pairs of the subspecies samueli in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia may produce two broods, while those of South-eastern subspecies only produce one. Nesting takes place in large vertical tree hollows of tall trees. Isolated trees are generally chosen, so birds can fly to and from them relatively unhindered. The same tree may be used for many years. Hollows can be 1 to 2metres (3â€“7ft) deep and 0.25â€“0.5metres (10â€“20in) wide, with a base of <b>woodchips.</b> A clutch consists of 1 to 2 white, lustreless eggs, although the second chick is in most cases neglected and perishes in infancy.|$|E
