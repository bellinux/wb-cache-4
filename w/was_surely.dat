5|$|Firm {{evidence}} for specific early {{performances of the}} play is scant. What is known is that {{the crew of the}} ship Red Dragon, anchored off Sierra Leone, performed Hamlet in September 1607; that the play toured in Germany within five years of Shakespeare's death; and that it was performed before James I in 1619 and Charles I in 1637. Oxford editor George Hibbard argues that, since the contemporary literature contains many allusions and references to Hamlet (only Falstaff is mentioned more, from Shakespeare), the play <b>was</b> <b>surely</b> performed with a frequency that the historical record misses.|$|E
5|$|Europa's tale, {{well known}} in later {{classical}} literature and beyond, appears in a largely familiar form in the Catalogue. She caught Zeus's eye while she and some friends were gathering flowers in a meadow. The god transformed into a bull with breath smelling of saffron, {{in the guise of}} which he abducted Europa, carrying her upon his back to Crete. There she bore Minos, Rhadamanthys and Sarpedon to Zeus, and he gave her a necklace made by Hephaestus that would figure in Theban saga as the Necklace of Harmonia. Sarpedon ruled Lycia, and was apparently granted a lifespan equal to three generations of men by Zeus. His death at Troy and the rain of blood it inspired Zeus to send is briefly described. Minos ruled Crete, succeeding his stepfather Asterion. Poseidon sent up from the sea a bull which had sex with Minos' wife Pasiphae, siring the Minotaur. To Minos she also bore Deucalion, Catreus, Androgeos and Eurygyes, though it is equally possible that these last two names referred to a single son. At least one daughter, Ariadne, <b>was</b> <b>surely</b> present, for the myth of Androgeos–Eurygyes' death in Athens and the subsequent sacrifice of Athenian youths to the Minotaur will presuppose Theseus' expedition to Crete and Ariadne's complicity in slaying the beast.|$|E
5|$|The sky bears overt metaphorical {{significance}} {{and is the}} centrepiece of the painting's symbolism. Alexander, identified by the Egyptians and others as a god of the sun, finds his victory in the sun's rays; and the Persians are routed into the darkness beneath the crescent moon, {{a symbol of the}} Near East. Considered in terms of the painting's contemporary context, the sun's triumph over the moon represents Christendom's victory over the Islamism of the Ottomans. Eschatological meaning, probably inspired by prophecies in the Book of Daniel, is imbued in the heavenly setting. In particular, Daniel 7 predicts {{the rise and fall of}} four kingdoms before the Second Coming; these were thought to be Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome at the time of the painting's creation. Altdorfer saw the Battle of Issus as a principal indicator of the transition of power from Persia to Greece, and thus as an event of cosmic significance. The battle also marked a progression toward the end of the world – an important theological concern in the 16th century, given that the last traces of Rome were diminishing with the papacy. As a member of the Regensburg council and a practising Catholic, Altdorfer frequently interacted with the Church and <b>was</b> <b>surely</b> aware of this trend of eschatological thought. Schedel, too, had calculated that the final age of the seven he identified was nigh. It may therefore be inferred that the sky's expression of the momentous event at Issus was intended to be of contemporary relevance as well.|$|E

25|$|The most {{brilliant}} analysis ever {{done on a}} structural puzzle <b>was</b> <b>surely</b> the solution (1953) of the terramycin problem. It was a problem of great industrial importance, and hence many able chemists had performed {{an enormous amount of}} work trying to determine the structure. There seemed to be too much data to resolve the problem, because a significant number of observations, although experimentally correct, were very misleading. Woodward took a large piece of cardboard, wrote on it all the facts and, by thought alone, deduced the correct structure for terramycin. Nobody else could have done that at the time.|$|E
25|$|The {{region of}} this early {{agriculture}} {{is in the}} middle Mississippi valley, from Memphis north to St. Louis and extending about 300 miles east and west of the river, mostly in Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, and Tennessee. The oldest archaeological site known in the United States in which Indians were growing, rather than gathering, food is Phillips Spring in Missouri. At Phillips Spring, dating from 3,000 BCE, archaeologists found abundant walnuts, hickory nuts, acorns, grapes, elderberries, ragweed, bottle gourd, and the seeds of Cucurbita pepo, a gourd with edible seeds that is the ancestor of pumpkins and most squashes. The seeds found at Phillips Spring were larger than those of wild C. pepo. The agency for this change <b>was</b> <b>surely</b> human manipulation. Humans were selecting, planting, and tending seeds from plants that produced larger and tastier seeds. Ultimately, they would manipulate C. pepo to produce edible flesh.|$|E

25|$|After {{the ambush}} in via Fani the terrorists took {{only the most}} {{interesting}} for them of the five bags that Moro carried with him. Those containing the politician's medicines and his reserved documents. Further, the necessity of inflicting a coup de grâce {{to any of the}} bodyguards is in contrast with a hurried attack typical of such acts, and is motivated only by the necessity to eliminate any possible witness that would reveal that Moro was not there. In a letter to his wife Moro wrote during captivity he asked her {{to take care of his}} bags. Since Moro <b>was</b> <b>surely</b> aware that if his bags had been found in the massacre location, they had been taken by the investigators. Also the absence from his letter of any word about the victims of via Fani has been taken as an element in favour of the theory that Moro was captured while in his Gladio escort (see Involvement of P2, Gladio and of the Italian intelligence services) and not in via Fani and so did not know anything about their assassination.|$|E
500|$|Despite Morrell's {{exposure}} as a fraud, {{following the}} Margaret Oakley debacle, [...] his contemporaries did not uniformly denounce him. To some, he was [...] "the biggest liar in the Pacific", while d'Urville, who had earlier warmly praised Morrell's Four Voyages account, {{turned on the}} American and accused him of fabricating many of his supposed discoveries. However, Jeremiah Reynolds, who had expressed scepticism over the narrative, included Morrell's Pacific discoveries in his report to Congress A Report in relation to islands, reefs, and shoals in the Pacific Ocean.

500|$|Considered a horrorcore song, [...] "Monster" [...] {{has been}} {{described}} as brooding, disturbing, creepy and the [...] "weirdest A-list event-rap posse cut in recent memory." [...] The song begins with an ominous, distorted vocal roar, sung by Justin Vernon of Bon Iver, with Vernon declaring [...] "I shoot the lights out", which sets up the dark atmosphere of the track. The intro of the song is followed by a brief verse given by Ross, delivered in the rapping style of boom bap. In a deep voice, Ross asserts the lines [...] "bitch, I'm a monster, no good bloodsucker, fat motherfucker, now look who's in trouble," [...] over the eerie production featured during the beginning. Following the introduction by Ross, West then provides the song's hook, singing [...] "everybody know / I'm a motherfuckin' monster" [...] in a heavily distorted manner.

500|$|After Phips {{returned}} to London in August 1685, Samuel Pepys ordered the Navy Board {{to assess the}} Rose. Pepys {{had been out of}} power when Narborough set the strange plan in motion. In March and May 1686, Phips was ordered to attend the Lord Treasurer where {{it was found that the}} King was only to receive £471 in treasure, though the wear and tear on the Rose was estimated at £700. [...] In this age of piracy and high mortality, Phips making it back to London alive and with the King's ship still afloat was probably enough for him to pass the test. Already Narborough had a new plan in the works for Captain Phips, though this time it would be a private venture. Narborough's long infatuation with the Hispaniola treasure had not been diminished by Captain Stanley's discouragement on the Bonetta. And Knepp's report on Phips did not disqualify him. Phips had shown that he was serviceable: willing to harass the harbor of his hometown and to compromise between his own interests, and the interests of the crown. This <b>was</b> <b>surely</b> noted at Whitehall, even by the more conservative elements.|$|E
500|$|The track [...] "Junkie's Promise", sung by Moore, was {{described}} as a [...] "heroin vignette". It was originally interpreted by many as a tribute to Kurt Cobain of Nirvana. However, Moore later clarified that the song [...] "is purely about the emotional relationship between friends, one of which is a user. Any individual involved with drug addiction will lie to his friends for the self-serving need. It's the cruelest truth of the situation. Kurt may fit this profile and he <b>was</b> <b>surely</b> in my mind as I wrote but the song is not a specific dedication to him". Other songs such as [...] "Becuz" [...] and [...] "No Queen Blues" [...] were built upon [...] "numb grooves with slivers of melody, power, and gorgeously crafted noise". The final track on the album, [...] "The Diamond Sea", {{was described}} as a [...] "Neil Young-esque ballad billowing into an epic noise excursion". It is considered the longest track on any Sonic Youth album, excluding Sonic Youth Recordings releases. Due to its long duration, the song was edited down to 5:15 for release as a single, which also included an alternative 25-minute version as an additional track.|$|E
500|$|Scholars have {{observed}} that Navarette marked a departure from earlier precedent {{on the subject of}} anonymous tips, and some have argued that the case signifies a [...] "dilution" [...] of the Fourth Amendment's reasonable suspicion standard. One analyst argued that this departure [...] "could encourage passive and sloppy policing, for officers will be tempted to rely on easily acquired anonymous tips rather than engage in arduous collection of evidence." [...] Commentators have argued that Justice Kennedy's endorsement of the reliability of anonymous 911 calls signified a departure from earlier decisions that analyzed the reliability of tips under a totality of the circumstances framework. These commentators suggest that this departure [...] "increases the risk of fabricated tips." [...] Some analysts have also observed that the Court's opinion left several questions unanswered from earlier anonymous tip cases, including the question of whether there was an exception for dangerous crimes, and that the Court [...] "missed an opportunity to give lower courts some much needed guidance." [...] One commentator wrote, [...] "he time bomb mentioned in J.L. is still ticking". Another commentator argued that because Lorenzo Prado Navarette's driving was [...] "irreproachable" [...] for at least five minutes, [...] "the probability that Lorenzo Navarette was legally drunk <b>was</b> <b>surely</b> less than the probability for the average daytime driver of a pickup truck; indeed, it ostensibly was all but zero." ...|$|E

500|$|Analysts deconstructed all the {{tactical}} and technical deficiencies {{that led to}} the blowout result. Scolari still relied on the team that won the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup despite many players going through dry spells, and most of them not having any World Cup experience. Brazil had not played particularly well during the group stage and first two knockout games, relying heavily upon Neymar in attack, and their flaws were exposed in the semi-finals where they faced a much tougher adversary in Germany. Neymar was such a focal point that the team barely trained any formations without him. In his absence, Scolari replaced Neymar with Bernard to maintain the attacking tradition of Brazilian football, instead of the [...] "'logical call' [...] <b>was</b> <b>surely</b> to bring in an extra midfielder" [...] against the Germans. The assistant coaches even supported bringing in the more defensive-minded Ramires and Willian. Thus, Fernandinho and Luiz Gustavo were overwhelmed by the Germany midfield trio of Toni Kroos, Sami Khedira and Bastian Schweinsteiger. The defense that had already been questioned in previous games collapsed as Dante was proven to be an inadequate replacement for the suspended Silva, while David Luiz made uncharacteristic errors during the semi-final. Other errors included setting up Marcelo to a more attacking play, while Gustavo was tasked with covering him, and the ineffective role of Fred who is often regarded as a tactical striker rather than goal-scoring striker.|$|E
500|$|King Æthelwulf's {{ring was}} found in a cart rut in Laverstock in Wiltshire in about August 1780 by one William Petty, who sold it to a {{silversmith}} in Salisbury. The silversmith sold it to the Earl of Radnor, and the earl's son, William, donated it to the British Museum in 1829. The ring, together with a similar ring of Æthelwulf's daughter Æthelswith, is one of two key examples of nielloed 9th-century metalwork. They appear to represent the emergence of a [...] "court style" [...] of West Saxon metalwork, characterised by an unusual Christian iconography, such as a pair of peacocks at the Fountain of Life on the Æthelwulf ring, associated with Christian immortality. The ring is inscribed [...] "Æthelwulf Rex", firmly associating it with the King, and the inscription forms part of the design, so it cannot have been added later. Many of its features are typical of 9th-century metalwork, such as the design of two birds, beaded and speckled borders, and a saltire with arrow-like terminals on the back. It was probably manufactured in Wessex, but was typical of the uniformity of animal ornament in England in the 9th century. In the view of Leslie Webster, an expert on medieval art: [...] "Its fine Trewhiddle style ornament would certainly fit a mid ninth-century date." [...] In Nelson's view, [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>surely</b> made to be a gift from this royal lord to a brawny follower: the sign of a successful ninth-century kingship". The art historian David Wilson sees it as a survival of the pagan tradition of the generous king as the [...] "ring-giver".|$|E
500|$|Bijay Mandal is a {{building}} with a layout plan of x dimensions, with a well proportioned square dome. It cannot be categorized as a tower or a palace. It is a typical Toghlaqi structure with an octagonal plan built in rubble masonry (with massive battered sloping walls on east, west and southern directions) on a raised platform with door ways in each cardinal direction. The purpose of this unusual [...] structure and {{the ruins of the}} Sar Dara Palace was described by [...] Ibn Battuta [...] as the palace with multiple chambers and the [...] large public audience hall as the famed Hazar Sutan Palace. It was also interpreted as serving as an observation tower to monitor the activities of his troops. The ambience of the place presented it as place to relax and enjoy the scenic view of the environs. The inclined path around the monument was a walkway leading to the apartments of the Sultan. Two large openings in the living rooms of the floor were inferred as leading to the vaults or the treasury. On the level platform, outside the building in front of the apartment rooms, small holes equally spaced are seen, which have been inferred to be holes used to fix wooden pillars to hold a temporary shamiana (pavilion) or cover. The process of ushering people into the presence of the Sultan was devious and formal involving entry through semipublic places to private chambers to the audience hall. The debate on whether the Hazara [...] Sutan Palace cited as existing during Allauddin Khalji reign and also during Togluq's time {{are one and the same}} palace, has not been conclusive. A plausible hypothesis is that the stone hall of the palace was built by Allauddin Khalji while the tower adjoining the stone buildings <b>was</b> <b>surely</b> built by Mohammed bin Toghluq.|$|E
