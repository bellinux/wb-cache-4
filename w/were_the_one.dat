5|$|British and French {{submarine}} {{operations in}} the Sea of Marmara <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> significant area of success of the Gallipoli Campaign, forcing the Ottomans to abandon the sea as a transport route. Between April and December 1915, nine British and four French submarines carried out 15 patrols, sinking one battleship, one destroyer, five gunboats, 11 troop transports, 44 supply ships and 148 sailing vessels {{at a cost of}} eight Allied submarines sunk in the strait or in the Sea of Marmara. During the campaign there was always one British submarine in the Sea of Marmara, sometimes two; in October 1915, there were four Allied submarines in the region. E2 left the Sea of Marmara on 2 January 1916, the last British submarine in the region. Four E-class and five B-class submarines remained in the Mediterranean Sea following the evacuation of Helles. By this time the Ottoman navy had been all but forced to cease {{operations in the}} area, while merchant shipping had also been significantly curtailed. The official German naval historian, Admiral Eberhard von Mantey, later concluded that had the sea-lanes of communication been completely severed the Ottoman 5th Army would likely have faced catastrophe. As it was these operations were a source of significant anxiety, posing a constant threat to shipping and causing heavy losses, effectively dislocating Ottoman attempts to reinforce their forces at Gallipoli and shelling troop concentrations and railways.|$|E

25|$|Pieter van den Broecke, {{who visited}} Batavia from June {{until the end}} of December 1629 {{published}} a bird eye's view of Batavia in late 1629. The picture showed the completed sea-side wall of Batavia Castle but the entrance has only some wood scaffolding with no neoclassic stone decoration. It is not clear what happened between 1629 and the 1630s {{because of the lack of}} documents, however in later etching of the Castle in mid 1630s, the Waterpoort had already complete with the gate decoration. The shape of this decoration is similar to that found on the wrecked VOC ship the Batavia. The Batavia fleet was supposed to carry the stone ornaments for the gates of Batavia Castle. Batavia, which departed from Texel on October 29, 1628, was shipwrecked on the Houtman Abrolhos, Western Australia, on June 4, 1629. On July 7, 1692, Pelsaert arrived at Batavia to report the shipwreck, so on July 15 the Sardam departed from Batavia to rescue the Batavia fleet and salvage the goods which include material for the decorative gates. Sardam arrived at the wreck-site on September 17, 1629 and stayed there until November 15. It arrived back at Batavia on December 5, 1629. Apparently not all of the salvages were discovered, as another gateway stone ornaments were discovered in 1963 and was now kept in the Maritime Museum in Fremantle, Australia. It has been assumed that the stone gateway ornaments discovered in the 1960s <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> destined for the Waterpoort of Batavia Castle. Evidence for this assumption is a gold pendant, dated 25 November 1632, which was made to commemorate the Chinese contribution to the defeat of the army of Mataram. It clearly shows the completed Watergate.|$|E
