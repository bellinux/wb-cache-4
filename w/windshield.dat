5|$|National Airlines' New York-Miami route {{was usually}} flown by a Boeing 707 as Flight 601. On January 5, 1960, the 707 {{aircraft}} scheduled {{to fly to}} Miami was grounded due to cracks that were discovered in the cockpit <b>windshield.</b> The <b>windshield</b> replacement procedure would take eight hours to perform, so National Airlines transferred the passengers of Flight 601 to two propliner aircraft it had in reserve.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper body}} had a baggage {{compartment}} separating the driver's compartment from the crew compartment. Bench {{seats on the}} sides of the vehicle, with under-seat storage, could accommodate six men. The <b>windshield</b> could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted at the upper part of the rear body. It fastened to the <b>windshield</b> when erected. Four side pieces could be mounted to protect the crew from the weather.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper body}} had a crew {{compartment}} with three bench seats, {{one for the}} driver and his assistant, and two others for the crew. The rear cargo area contained storage compartments, {{one on each side}} and two in the rear. The <b>windshield</b> could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted above the rear storage compartments. It fastened to the <b>windshield</b> when erected.|$|E

5000|$|Modern, glued-in <b>windshields</b> {{contribute}} to the vehicle's rigidity, but the main force for innovation has historically been the need to prevent injury from sharp glass fragments. Almost all nations now require <b>windshields</b> to stay in one piece even if broken, except if pierced by a strong force. Properly installed automobile <b>windshields</b> are also essential to safety; along with {{the roof of the}} car, they provide protection to the vehicle's occupants {{in the case of a}} roll-over accident [...]|$|R

5|$|Introduced a Mark Levinson premium sound system. In {{its highest}} trim specification, the LS 430 {{included}} Lexus Link telematics, power door and trunk closers, heated and cooled front seats, and power reclining massage rear seats equipped with audio controls, power sunshade, a cooler, and air purifier. Several rear seat features adopted for the LS 430 {{had been previously}} available in Japanese market luxury vehicles. Safety features added to the LS 430 included front and rear side curtain airbags, park sensors, rain-sensing <b>windshield</b> wipers, and electronic brakeforce distribution. The vehicle also gained water repellent <b>windshield</b> and side glass.|$|E
5|$|The sensors of the {{starship}} U.S.S. Enterprise {{pick up a}} strange alien spacecraft following it in hot pursuit. Mr. Spock, played by Chevy Chase, identifies it as a 1968 Chrysler Imperial with a tinted <b>windshield</b> and retractable headlights.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper body}} had a crew {{compartment}} {{common to all}} versions. This had bench seats, one for the driver and his assistant, and another for the crew. The rear portion of the upper body was adapted for the vehicle's intended role. The artillery model had two extra bench seats for the gun's crew and space for its ammunition. The cargo version had just two storage compartments mounted {{in the front of}} the cargo compartment, one on each side, that opened to the outside. The <b>windshield</b> could fold forward and was also removable. A convertible canvas top was mounted at the upper part of the rear body. It fastened to the <b>windshield</b> when erected.|$|E
50|$|The <b>windshields</b> were {{provided}} by GM rival Libbey Glass (Ford).|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} roadster automobiles {{had only}} basic bodies without doors, <b>windshields,</b> or other weather protection. By the 1920s they were appointed similarly to touring cars, with doors, <b>windshields,</b> simple folding tops, and side curtains. When roadsters of this era were equipped with rumble seats, the seats folded {{into the body}} when not in use.|$|R

5|$|Defendants Irving Potash and Benjamin J. Davis {{were among}} the {{audience}} members attacked as they left a September 4 concert headlined by Paul Robeson in Peekskill, New York. It was given to benefit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC), which was funding the defendants' legal expenses. Hundreds lined the roads leaving the performance grounds and threw rocks and bottles at the departing vehicles without interference by the police. Over 140 people suffered injuries, including Potash, whose eyes were struck by glass from a broken <b>windshield.</b> The trial was suspended for two days while Potash recovered from his injuries.|$|E
5|$|Eva also visited Switzerland {{during her}} European tour, a visit {{that has been}} viewed as {{the worst part of}} the trip. According to the book Evita: A Biography by John Barnes, while she {{traveled}} down a street with many people crowding her car, someone threw two stones and smashed the <b>windshield.</b> She threw her hands up in shock, but was not injured. Later, while sitting with the Foreign Minister, protesters threw tomatoes at her. The tomatoes hit the Foreign Minister and splattered on Eva's dress. After these two events, Eva had had enough, and after two months returned to Argentina.|$|E
5|$|Haynes' Model L was {{his most}} popular vehicle. First {{designed}} in 1905, the three-speed car could travel at 35mph (58km/h) and carry four passengers; the company sold over 4,300. Haynes expanded the company significantly in 1908 to accommodate ever-increasing sales. More stock was issued and more capital raised {{to build a}} new and larger factory. By 1909 the company was producing 650 cars annually with models priced between $2,500 and $5,500. In 1910, Haynes Auto became the first company to build a car with a roof, <b>windshield,</b> headlights, and a speedometer as standard on each vehicle to continue their goal of producing the best luxury vehicles.|$|E

5|$|In 2003, Slavoj Hašek was awoken by commotion {{from outside}} of his house. Hašek left his house with a shotgun and pursued a thief. After the thief got to his own car and drove it in Hašek's direction, he shot and killed him. Hašek was sentenced to five years {{imprisonment}} with the High Court in Olomouc arguing that the defense could not be legitimate, since the shot went through a side window rather than through the front <b>windshield.</b> Hašek was pardoned by President Klaus shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Ball {{was one of}} six {{recipients}} of the Victoria Cross to be featured on a special commemorative edition of Royal Mail stamps marking the 150th anniversary of the award. His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Nottingham Castle Museum along with his other medals and memorabilia, including a bullet-holed Avro <b>windshield,</b> a section of engine piping {{from one of his}} damaged Nieuports, his Freedom of Nottingham Scroll and Casket, and various letters and other papers. A portrait study by Noel Denholm Davis is in the collection of Nottingham City Museums and Galleries.|$|E
5|$|In January 1944 the Luftwaffe {{initiated}} Operation Steinbock. Cunningham filed two claims {{during the}} offensive which lasted until May 1944. On {{the night of}} the 20/21 February 1944 he claimed Junkers Ju 188 damaged at 22:09 near Staplehurst. One Ju 188 was lost and its destruction was attributed to another pilot. On {{the night of the}} 23/24 February he claimed a probable victory against another Ju 188 off Beachy Head. One Ju 188E-1 landed at Coulommiers after surviving an attack by a night fighter. Werknummer 260222, code U5+AN from 5./KG 2 returned with two crewmen injured—Unteroffizier Johann Triebel and Wihelm Spönemann. During these missions Cunningham was nearly shot down. Closing in on a Ju 188 from astern, the gunners suddenly opened fire and the Junkers took evasive manoeuvres. A single round struck the <b>windshield</b> nearly shattering it. Glass fragments struck Cunningham in the face which were later removed in a field hospital. Later, a captured German crew told intelligence officers a new radar was being used in the rear of German aircraft to detect night fighters. Bombers were now more difficult to surprise. Cunningham's last encounter with the enemy in 1944 was in pursuit of an Me 410. He had to give up when his <b>windshield</b> iced over near the French coast.|$|E

5|$|In Muncie, Indiana, Nora Pearce and Curtis Delario {{argue about}} the death of her husband, Ray. Nora {{believes}} Ray died from Gulf War syndrome. After attempting to comfort her, Delario starts to drive home and crashes into a man {{in the middle of the}} road. His car is totaled, but the man is unharmed as the car breaks around his body. Curtis, grievously injured, looks up at the man and says, “Ray?” The man’s arm slams through the <b>windshield</b> as Curtis screams.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the road surface, vibrations in a motorcycle {{can be caused by}} the engine and wheels, if unbalanced. Manufacturers employ a variety of technologies to reduce or damp these vibrations, such as engine balance shafts, rubber engine mounts, and tire weights. The problems that vibration causes have also spawned an industry of after-market parts and systems designed to reduce it. Add-ons include handlebar weights, isolated foot pegs, and engine counterweights. At high speeds, motorcycles and their riders may also experience aerodynamic flutter or buffeting. This can be abated by changing the air flow over key parts, such as the <b>windshield.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mirrors reflect Marion as she packs, {{her eyes}} as she checks the {{rear-view}} mirror, her face in the policeman's sunglasses, and her hands as she counts out the money in the car dealership's bathroom. A motel window serves as a mirror by reflecting Marion and Norman together. Hitchcock shoots through Marion's <b>windshield</b> and the telephone booth, when Arbogast phones Sam and Lila. The heavy downpour {{can be seen as a}} foreshadowing of the shower, and its cessation can be seen as a symbol of Marion making up her mind to return to Phoenix.|$|E

While driving back to Mission Control, Generoo sees the face come at her through her <b>windshield,</b> causing her to crash her car.|$|E
5|$|When Johnson {{returned}} to his car, he found a note from Dean Dull attached to his <b>windshield.</b> Dull's note offered to purchase the car to serve as Georgia Tech's official mascot. Johnson, after great deliberation, agreed to take $1,000 but would eventually return the money in 1984 so that the car would be remembered as an official donation to Georgia Tech and the Alexander-Tharpe Fund. The Ramblin' Wreck would be officially transferred to the Athletic Association on May 26, 1961.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} American {{self-propelled}} guns produced {{during the early}} World War II period, the prototype was assembled and tested at the Aberdeen Proving Ground. The M2 recoil mechanism {{and other parts of}} the M2 howitzer carriage were used in the vehicle mounting. After several tests, the gun carriage proved fragile on bumpy terrain. The problem was corrected by reinforcing the frame, and redesigning the howitzer mount. Demountable headlights were recommended because of the muzzle blast, although they were not available for early production models. Early models had no shield for the howitzer either, but a foldable shield was added during testing. The gun faced forward, like many other half-track models. The total traverse was 40 degrees and the elevation was from −5 to +35 degrees. The armored <b>windshield</b> cover was remounted so it could fold onto the hood. After further testing, it was accepted for production.|$|E

25|$|The SM's six {{headlight}} set up {{was illegal}} in the U.S. {{at the time}} and consequently, U.S. specification cars were fitted with four fixed round exposed lamps. Also, the separate glass <b>windshields</b> of the headlights were illegal in the USA after 1967, which is why the DS did not get them on USA cars when it was restyled for 1968, and the VW Beetle and Vanagon/Kombi and Jaguar E-Type lost their headlight glass <b>windshields</b> at the same time.|$|R
50|$|<b>Windshields</b> {{protect the}} vehicle's {{occupants}} from wind and flying debris such as dust, insects, and rocks, {{and provide an}} aerodynamically formed window towards the front. UV coating may be applied to screen out harmful ultraviolet radiation. However, this is usually unnecessary since most auto <b>windshields</b> are made from laminated safety glass. The majority of UV-B is absorbed by the glass itself, and any remaining UV-B together {{with most of the}} UV-A is absorbed by the PVB bonding layer.|$|R
