5|$|On Thursday morning 20 June two {{defendants}} <b>were</b> <b>indicted</b> {{for stealing}} silverware {{from the home}} of Rev. J. Vachell in Littleport and one was charged with receiving the stolen goods. Four witnesses called were Elizabeth Carter following which Mr Justice Burrough summed up. Lavender was pronounced guilty of the theft and Beamiss and Butcher received not guilty verdicts.|$|E
5|$|De la Rúa {{was also}} indicted {{for the police}} {{repression}} that {{took place during the}} crisis; he was tried by judge Claudio Bonadio, who declared him innocent in 2009. The Supreme Court overturned Bonadio's ruling and ordered him to further investigate the matter. De la Rúa and Cavallo <b>were</b> <b>indicted</b> for illegally benefiting the banks that took part in the Megacanje. They were declared innocent on October 6, 2014.|$|E
5|$|In February 2012, an Osijek court convicted Milan Marinković of {{war crimes}} and sentenced him to 3 ½ {{years in prison for}} mistreating two {{captured}} Croatian police officers. In 2014, Marinković's sentence was reduced to three years on appeal. Four other men <b>were</b> <b>indicted</b> in relation to the officers' mistreatment, but all four live outside Croatia, and are not subject to prosecution by the Croatian judiciary.|$|E

5|$|The {{pamphlet}} was confiscated by {{the police}} on 8 February. The person who printed the pamphlet, Nikolai Olsen, was arrested on the same day, and the apprehension of Jon Hol followed on 10 February. He remained in custody until 26 February, and was indicted on 11 March, for lèse majesté. Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson and Lars Holst <b>were</b> <b>indicted</b> on the same charge. Upon the arrests, the newspaper Verdens Gang noted that no conservative writers had been sanctioned, despite openly calling for a coup d'état.|$|E
5|$|A {{search warrant}} {{executed}} on April 25, 2007, {{as part of}} a drug investigation of Vick's cousin Davon Boddie led to discovery of evidence of unlawful dog fighting activities at a property owned by Vick in rural Surry County in southeastern Virginia, with extensive facilities for the activity. Media attention quickly grew as state officials investigated, soon joined by federal authorities. As separate state and federal investigations progressed, more details emerged about an interstate dog-fighting ring that involved drugs and gambling. Gruesome details of abuse, torture, and execution of under-performing dogs galvanized animal rights activists and expressions of public outrage. Vick and several others <b>were</b> <b>indicted</b> on federal and Virginia state felony charges related to the operation.|$|E
5|$|In March 2016, Brian J. Stone, Spencer's father, {{as well as}} {{two other}} men, <b>were</b> <b>indicted</b> on charges of {{collecting}} $1.5 million USD in insurance money in an arson and insurance fraud scheme, which resulted in setting fires at Sacramento-area commercial buildings. Stone's father allegedly provided business services, including assisting with insurance claims after seven fires in Sacramento and Carmichael, California, between 2009 and 2013. He was charged with 13 counts of mail or wire fraud. Stone currently lives in Sacramento as of 2016 and is a Christian.|$|E
50|$|On September 24, 2004, bishop Dupré <b>was</b> <b>indicted</b> by a Hampden County {{grand jury}} on {{two counts of}} child molestation. He thus became the first Catholic bishop ever to <b>be</b> <b>indicted</b> of sexual abuse.|$|R
50|$|On March 8, 2011, he <b>was</b> <b>indicted</b> by the International Criminal Court {{for four}} charges {{of crimes against}} {{humanity}} committed during the 2007-2008 Kenyan crisis. He <b>is</b> <b>indicted</b> to have committed these crimes against PNU supporters.|$|R
2500|$|In March 2001, a {{grand jury}} indicted Knoller and Noel. Knoller <b>was</b> <b>indicted</b> for second-degree murder and {{involuntary}} manslaughter, Noel <b>was</b> <b>indicted</b> for involuntary manslaughter, and [...] "both also face felony charges of keeping a mischievous dog".|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that all the English witch trials between the early 15th and early 18th centuries resulted in fewer than 500 executions, so this one series of trials in July and August 1612 accounts for more than two per cent of that total. Court records show that Lancashire was unusual in the north of England for the frequency of its witch trials. Neighbouring Cheshire, for instance, also suffered from economic problems and religious activists, but there only 47 people <b>were</b> <b>indicted</b> for causing harm by witchcraft between 1589 and 1675, of whom 11 were found guilty.|$|E
5|$|Mayor Daley {{also said}} he didn't know if there were other city {{contracts}} involving the younger Daley. The city's Inspector General and federal authorities began investigations in December 2007. Patrick and Vanecko hired criminal defense attorneys. Municipal Sewer Services LLC folded in April 2008. In January 2011, Anthony Duffy, the president of Municipal Sewer Services, was charged with three counts of mail fraud in conjunction with minority-contracting and Jesse Brunt and his company, Brunt Brothers Transfer Inc., <b>were</b> <b>indicted</b> on three counts of mail fraud. Patrick and Vanecko were not charged.|$|E
5|$|Oliver North and John Poindexter <b>were</b> <b>indicted</b> on {{multiple}} charges on March 16, 1988. North, indicted on 16 counts, {{was found guilty}} by a jury of three felony counts. The convictions were vacated on appeal {{on the grounds that}} North's Fifth Amendment rights may have been violated by the indirect use of his testimony to Congress, which had been given under a grant of immunity. In 1990, Poindexter was convicted on several felony counts of conspiracy, lying to Congress, obstruction of justice, and altering and destroying documents pertinent to the investigation. His convictions were also overturned on appeal on similar grounds. Arthur L. Liman served as chief counsel for the Senate during the Iran–Contra Scandal.|$|E
50|$|McCuller <b>was</b> <b>indicted</b> for Murder in the Second Degree and Anderson <b>was</b> <b>indicted</b> for {{hindering}} {{prosecution in}} the first degree. He subsequently plead guilty {{and was sentenced to}} seventeen and a half years to life in prison.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2001, a {{grand jury}} indicted Knoller and Noel. Knoller <b>was</b> <b>indicted</b> for second-degree murder and {{involuntary}} manslaughter, Noel <b>was</b> <b>indicted</b> for involuntary manslaughter, and [...] "both also faced felony charges of keeping a mischievous dog".|$|R
2500|$|... (Acting) Tindaro [...] "Tino" [...] Corso – {{an acting}} capo {{operating}} from Staten Island and Manhattan. Corso <b>was</b> <b>indicted</b> along with Anthony Tortorello in 1997. In 2017, Corso <b>was</b> <b>indicted</b> along with Truscello, Crea and Madonna on racketeering charges.|$|R
5|$|Pitt's {{administration}} {{took the}} guilty verdict in Paine's trial {{as a sign}} that further prosecutions for sedition were possible, and began many. In the 17 months following the trial, 11 publishers of the Rights of Man were prosecuted, receiving prison sentences of up to 4 years. These acted as a prelude to the 1794 Treason Trials, in which a dozen reformers <b>were</b> <b>indicted</b> for allegedly conspiring to bring about a revolution. Erskine played a prominent role in defending many of them, including Thomas Hardy, John Horne Tooke and John Thelwall, all three of whom were acquitted.|$|E
5|$|Televised {{hearings}} in early 1957 exposed misconduct {{by both the}} Beck and the Hoffa factions of the Teamsters Union. Both Hoffa and Beck <b>were</b> <b>indicted,</b> but Hoffa won the battle {{for control of the}} Teamsters. In response, the AFL-CIO instituted a policy that no union official who had taken the Fifth Amendment during a corruption investigation could continue in a leadership position. Meany told the Teamsters that they could continue as members of the AFL-CIO if Hoffa resigned as president. Hoffa refused, and the Teamsters were ousted from the AFL-CIO on December 6, 1957. Meany supported the AFL-CIO's adoption of a code of ethics, {{in the wake of the}} scandal.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, {{seventeen}} people <b>were</b> <b>indicted</b> by {{a federal}} grand jury and five were found guilty of wilfully interfering with a marshal in performance of his duties (Braden, Patterson, Pryor, Purcell, and John J. Doyle, a leader in the Settler's League). They were convicted in federal court (with Judge Sawyer presiding) and sentenced to eight months in prison and fined $300 each. Their time spent in imprisonment was hardly difficult. Three of the men's wives were allowed to live with them, and Susan Curtis, daughter of one of the jailers, fell in love with and later married Braden. Upon their release in September 1881, they were greeted by a joyous crowd of 3,000 in Hanford. Such was the anti-railroad sentiment that the five were looked upon as heroes by many across California, and those killed were considered martyrs who had given their lives for a cause.|$|E
50|$|Doyle <b>was</b> <b>indicted</b> on 18 counts.|$|R
50|$|Several CONCACAF {{officials}} have <b>been</b> <b>indicted.</b>|$|R
50|$|September 2016, Hartsell <b>was</b> <b>indicted</b> for fraud.|$|R
5|$|Because the {{governor}} controls so many appointments to commissions—approximately 2,000 {{according to a}} 1992 estimate—the office has been historically {{considered one of the}} most powerful state executive positions in the United States. Additionally, {{the governor}} is given wide discretion in awarding state contracts, further augmenting his influence. In the second half of the 20th century, attempts were made to curb the use of the governor's appointment power for political patronage. During his second term in office, Happy Chandler issued an executive order creating a merit system that forbade the hiring or firing of state employees for political reasons; his successor, Bert T. Combs, pushed a new merit system through the legislature, protecting it from abolition by executive order. Despite the presence of the merit system, many governors have been criticized for abusing their appointment power. In 2005, Ernie Fletcher and several members of his administration <b>were</b> <b>indicted</b> for violating the merit system in their hiring practices; the charges were later dropped as part of an agreement with the prosecutor, Attorney General Greg Stumbo.|$|E
5|$|Bryant and Milam <b>were</b> <b>indicted</b> for murder. The grand jury's prosecuting attorney, Hamilton Caldwell, was not {{confident}} {{that he could get}} a conviction in a case of white violence against a black male accused of insulting a white woman. A local black paper was surprised at the indictment and praised the decision, as did the New York Times. The high-profile comments published in Northern newspapers and by the NAACP were of concern to the prosecuting attorney, Gerald Chatham; he worried that his office {{would not be able to}} secure a guilty verdict, despite the compelling evidence. Having limited funds, Bryant and Milam initially had difficulty finding attorneys to represent them, but five attorneys at a Sumner law firm offered their services pro bono. Their supporters placed collection jars in stores and other public places in the Delta, eventually gathering $10,000 for the defense.|$|E
5|$|In October 1988, Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, {{together}} with eight associates (including Adnan Khashoggi, a Saudi Arabian businessman and weapons smuggler {{believed to have}} been involved with her husband's regime), <b>were</b> <b>indicted</b> by a federal grand jury in Manhattan on charges of racketeering, conspiracy, fraud and obstruction of justice. Tobacco heiress Doris Duke posted $5 million bail for the former First Lady. The Marcos couple's defense team was led by criminal defense attorney Gerry Spence. Actor George Hamilton, an unindicted co-conspirator, testified at trial under a grant of immunity, acknowledging that he had received a $5.5-million loan from an associate of hers. In July 1990, following a three-month trial, she was acquitted of all charges. By that time, Ferdinand had died in exile in Hawaii on 28 September 1989.|$|E
50|$|On July 8, 2009, he <b>was</b> <b>indicted</b> {{on eight}} felony counts for misappropriating $150,000 {{and using it}} for {{political}} campaigns. Two current associate vice chancellors <b>were</b> also <b>indicted.</b>|$|R
25|$|Some {{officials}} have <b>been</b> <b>indicted</b> by a US court.|$|R
50|$|He <b>was</b> <b>indicted</b> by a {{grand jury}} in 1899.|$|R
5|$|In {{the weeks}} before the Gator Bowl, media and fan {{attention}} focused on Virginia Tech's possible disappointment at not being selected for a BCS game, the coaching situations at the two schools, {{and the issue of}} whether or not Tech quarterback Michael Vick would return for another year of collegiate football. After the Virginia Tech-Clemson matchup was announced for the Gator Bowl, spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by 6.5 points. The betting line remained there throughout the month of December and until the game began. There were almost no off-field incidents involving players from either team: The only notable event involved two backup players from Clemson who <b>were</b> <b>indicted</b> for money counterfeiting and were suspended for the Gator Bowl. In exchange for appearing in the game, the teams were guaranteed to split a payout of $3,313,610.|$|E
5|$|Many {{executives}} at Enron <b>were</b> <b>indicted</b> {{for a variety}} of charges and some were later sentenced to prison. Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, was found guilty in a United States District Court of illegally destroying documents relevant to the SEC investigation which voided its license to audit public companies, effectively closing the business. By the time the ruling was overturned at the U.S. Supreme Court, the company had lost the majority of its customers and had ceased operating. Enron employees and shareholders received limited returns in lawsuits, despite losing billions in pensions and stock prices. As a consequence of the scandal, new regulations and legislation were enacted to expand the accuracy of financial reporting for public companies. One piece of legislation, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, increased penalties for destroying, altering, or fabricating records in federal investigations or for attempting to defraud shareholders. The act also increased the accountability of auditing firms to remain unbiased and independent of their clients.|$|E
5|$|Several {{investigations}} ensued, including by the U.S. Congress and the three-person, Reagan-appointed Tower Commission. Neither {{found any}} evidence that President Reagan himself knew {{of the extent of}} the multiple programs. Ultimately the sale of weapons to Iran was not deemed a criminal offense but charges were brought against five individuals for their support of the Contras. Those charges, however, were later dropped because the administration refused to declassify certain documents. The indicted conspirators faced various lesser charges instead. In the end, fourteen administration officials <b>were</b> <b>indicted,</b> including then-Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger. Eleven convictions resulted, some of which were vacated on appeal. The rest of those indicted or convicted were all pardoned {{in the final days of}} the presidency of George H.W. Bush, who had been Vice President at the time of the affair. The Iran-Contra Affair and the ensuing deception to protect senior administration officials including President Reagan has been cast as an example of post-truth politics.|$|E
