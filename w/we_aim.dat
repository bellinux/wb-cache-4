25|$|The {{evolutionary}} theory proposed by Darwin states {{that only the}} fittest will survive and by lying, <b>we</b> <b>aim</b> to improve other's perception of our social image and status, capability, and desirability in general. Studies have shown that humans begin lying at a mere age of 6 months, through crying and laughing, to gain attention. Scientific studies have also shown the presence of gender differences in lying.|$|E

Secondarily, <b>we</b> <b>aimed</b> to identify any potential differences between two urban referral centres for clubfoot.|$|R

25|$|All Time Low {{released}} {{their debut}} album The Party Scene in July 2005 through independent label Emerald Moon Records. In December, {{it was announced}} that the band was unsigned, but were attracting attention from a number of record labels. In winter 2006, the band performed a showcase for John Janick the founder of record label Fueled by Ramen. They were not signed because Cute Is What <b>We</b> <b>Aim</b> For had recently been taken on by the label, which was {{not in a position to}} sign another band at the time. On March 28, 2006, {{it was announced that}} All Time Low had signed with Hopeless Records. The band was brought to the label's attention by fellow touring band Amber Pacific. Following high school graduation, the members focused on the group full-time, and released the Put Up or Shut Up EP in July.|$|E

500|$|Although {{their first}} album was named 13-Point Program to Destroy America, Nation of Ulysses didn't align {{themselves}} with a particular political philosophy: [...] "We don't usually address normal political dictums. [...] <b>We</b> <b>aim</b> toward the everyday fixtures of life, like aesthetics, sound, non-spoken things that are inherently political in nature instead of, like bogus politicians who focus on glossy surface issues which avoid any kind of revolutionary change." ...|$|E
500|$|Shortly after {{forming in}} January 2005, Cute Is What <b>We</b> <b>Aim</b> For began {{releasing}} demos through Myspace and PureVolume, which helped the band gain initial exposure. Guitarist Jeff Czum said their success {{was due to}} another band's street team: [...] "The street team leader from Hawthorne Heights reposted it on Myspace. Literally overnight we got like 10,000 fans on Myspace and started to get attention from labels." [...] In the following months, the group continued to record and play shows, increasing their fan base and declining advances from record labels.|$|E

Of the thirty one dates, twenty nine {{were in the}} US with two in Canada. The tour was inspired by Maurice Sendak's 1963 children's book Where the Wild Things Are, and included sets designed by artist Rob Dobi containing images from the book. Commenting on the decision to incorporate elements from the book, Wentz explained [...] "Where the Wild Things Are is a great narrative. It encapsulates pretty much every FOB song ever written: You know, tantrums and monster islands and all." ...|$|E
500|$|The Same Old Blood Rush with a New Touch is {{the debut}} studio album by American rock band Cute Is What <b>We</b> <b>Aim</b> For. Following the band's {{formation}} in early 2005, they posted demos on Myspace and PureVolume. These demos soon garnered attention from record labels.

In February 2006, the band began recording The Same Old Blood Rush with a New Touch with producer Matt Squire at Salad Days Studios in Beltsville, Maryland.

2500|$|Game {{director}} Justin Richmond {{explained that}} the game feels more open than other Uncharted games mainly due to the great new character creation feature. [...] "We're not an open-world game, we're {{never going to be}} an open-world game but; we can try. It's still up in the air how much gameplay we're going to let you wander around. But <b>we</b> <b>aim</b> to let you just ride a thousand miles off into the middle of nowhere and still find action and adventure as you go." [...] Ultimately the feel we want to get is, yeah, your character is lost in the desert. So it needs to feel like that. <b>We</b> <b>aim</b> to make it feel open-world." [...] In regards to whether or not PlayStation Move would be supported in Uncharted 3, Naughty Dog explained that [...] "A great Move game is a game made around Move and we started Uncharted long before that. It would be very difficult for us to adjust it. We tried a couple of things but it wasn't making a lot of sense." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Mussolini: [...] "Fascist {{education}} is moral, physical, social, and military: {{it aims to}} create a complete and harmoniously developed human, a fascist one according to our views". Mussolini structured this process taking in view the emotional side of childhood: [...] "Childhood and adolescence alike... cannot be fed solely by concerts, theories, and abstract teaching. The truth <b>we</b> <b>aim</b> to teach them should appeal foremost to their fantasy, to their hearts, and only then to their minds".|$|E
2500|$|Speaking in 2004, Feinig stated of the company's {{ambition}} [...] "Our {{vision is}} to be number one manufacturer of propeller-driven single and twins... and <b>we</b> <b>aim</b> to hold that position within five years". During 2001, aircraft deliveries totalled 176; during 2003, deliveries had risen to 263. In 2004, deliveries were forecast to climb as high as 850 aircraft per year in 2008.

2500|$|Harriott {{was always}} keen to {{communicate}} his ideas, be it on stage, in interviews or album liner notes. In 1962, {{he wrote in}} the liner notes for his Abstract album, [...] "of the various components comprising jazz today - constant time signatures, a steady four-four tempo, themes and predictable harmonic variations, fixed division of the chorus by bar lines and so on, <b>we</b> <b>aim</b> to retain at least one in each piece. But we may well, if the mood seems to us to demand it, dispense with all the others".|$|E
2500|$|During {{the summer}} of 2006, Paramore played a portion of Warped Tour, {{primarily}} on the Volcom and Hurley Stages, and their first night on the Main Stage was at a date in their hometown of Nashville. During the band's time at Warped Tour, they released The Summer Tic EP, which was sold exclusively during the tour. Paramore's first US headlining tour began on August 2, 2006 to a sold-out audience with support from This Providence, Cute Is What <b>We</b> <b>Aim</b> For, and Hit the Lights with the final show in Nashville. That year they were voted [...] "Best New Band", and Hayley Williams was voted as No.2 [...] "Sexiest Female", by readers of the British magazine Kerrang!.|$|E
2500|$|There exists {{considerable}} {{differences of}} opinion in how to set restoration goals and how to define their success among conservation groups. Some urge active restoration (e.g. eradicating invasive animals to allow the native ones to survive) and others who believe that protected areas should have the bare minimum of human interference, such as rewilding. Ecosystem restoration has generated controversy. Skeptics doubt that the benefits justify the economic investment or who point to failed restoration projects and question the feasibility of restoration altogether. It {{can be difficult to}} set restoration goals, in part because, as Anthony Bradshaw claims, [...] "ecosystems are not static, but in a state of dynamic equilibrium…. [...] <b>we</b> <b>aim</b> [...] moving target." ...|$|E
