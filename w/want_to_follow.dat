5|$|Final Destination 3 was {{originally}} {{the last part}} of a trilogy and had been in development since the release of Final Destination 2. Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise and one of the co-writers of the first two films, did not return for the third installment. According to director James Wong, unlike the second film, which was closely tied to the first, Final Destination 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel featuring new characters from the beginning, stating:e really felt that the idea of Final Destination, or the fact that Death can visit you and you can cheat death, that that could happen to anyone. And so we wanted to divorce from the first film character wise. We didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> that same thread. Part of the difficulty in that is when a character understands what happened to them before; it's a whole different way in which they react to what's happening now. We felt the franchise could exist with a new group of people, instead of following those older characters all the way through. We wanted to see if this could work.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a legend}} {{attached}} to {{the origin of the}} original crosses.

Once the abbot went to Italy, the four brothers decided to celebrate, yet they needed some money. They robbed and killed a wealthy Jew. In the same evening the brothers were called to the nearby moor, which was covered in snow and ice at the time. When they reached the place, they realized that the messenger who had beckoned them was the ghost of the murdered Jewish man.|$|E
25|$|The Transmobile was a {{monorail}} {{that would}} take riders from the base lodge, across Rt. 94 to the Cobblestone Village complex & Old Mill Mini Golf course, then to the Fest Haus Tents in Motorworld. Riders would ride sideways in cars built for 2 people. Each stop had 2 stations, one for riders heading towards the Alpine Center, and one for people heading to the Motorworld part of the park. Rides to / from the Alpine Center were one way, and riders {{were not allowed to}} stay on the ride, and travel round-trip without getting off at either end. This restriction sometimes caused conflicts between park staff, and riders who either did not understand - or did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the rules.|$|E
25|$|The Kennedy {{administration}} {{was concerned that}} a situation like the Suez Crisis might repeat itself, one that would once again incite a response from the Soviets. The Americans developed a plan to force the UK into the Multilateral Force concept, a dual-key arrangement that would only allow launch if both parties agreed. If those weapons {{were part of a}} single larger force, attacking them would require attacks on the other hosting countries as well, making the prospect far less interesting. The US also feared that other countries would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the UK lead and develop their own deterrent forces, leading to a proliferation problem even among their own allies. If a deterrent was being provided by a larger international force, the need for individual forces would be reduced.|$|E

Consequently, prior to the WTT draft on March 16, 2015, the Aviators traded Bob and Mike Bryan to the Dream for financial consideration. The Aviators did not protect 2014 WTT Female Most Valuable Player Daniela Hantuchová in the marquee portion of the draft. Madison Keys was assigned to the Aviators as a league-designated player, and they selected her as their only marquee draft pick. In the roster portion of the draft, the Aviators protected Raven Klaasen and Květa Peschke. They did not protect 2014 WTT Male Rookie of the Year Somdev Devvarman. The Aviators selected amateur Taylor Fritz and Chanelle Scheepers in the roster portion of the draft. Fritz was the only amateur player selected in the 2015 WTT Draft.|$|E
25|$|On 7 June 1911 {{a massive}} {{earthquake}} struck Mexico {{and the members}} of the White Cross rushed to the epicenter in Iguala, Guerrero to offer assistance. By the end of 1911, the Neutral White Cross had established 25 brigades across Mexico. Arzimendi was elected as the first woman partner of the Sociedad Mexicana de Geografía y Estadística, but she rejected the honor. She did accept a gold medal presented to her for dedication with helping the wounded by the Gran Liga Obrera (Grand League of Obrera). Ironically, in 1912, the Swiss Confederation of the International Red Cross presented Silver Medals to the nurses who had served in Chihuahua, Guerrero and Morelos with the White Cross. In 1913, factionalism between male doctors who did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> orders from a woman, split those supporting Arizmendi and those supporting Dr. Marquez into opposing camps. Arizmendi consulted a young attorney, José Vasconcelos, who would later become Mexico's Secretary of Education. Arizmendi withdrew and moved to New York City.|$|E

500|$|Novel-writing was {{a suspect}} {{occupation}} {{for women in the}} early 19th century, because it imperiled their social reputation by bringing them publicity, viewed as unfeminine. Therefore, like many other female writers, Austen published anonymously. Eventually, though, her novels' authorship became an open secret among the aristocracy. During one of her visits to London, the Prince Regent invited her, through his librarian, James Stanier Clarke, to view his library at Carlton House; his librarian mentioned that the Regent admired her novels and that [...] "if Miss Austen had any other Novel forthcoming, she was quite at liberty to dedicate it to the Prince". Austen, who disapproved of the prince's extravagant lifestyle, did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> this suggestion, but her friends convinced her otherwise: in short order, Emma was dedicated to him. Austen turned down the librarian's further hint to write a historical romance in honour of the prince's daughter's marriage.|$|E
500|$|As {{producer}} Simon Kinberg {{read the}} comic series , he suggested studio 20th Century Fox to adapt it. Kinberg, however, did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the comic too much, {{as he felt}} [...] "it was not fresh enough in terms of storytelling", considering them too similar to Twilight and John Hughes movies, and also because the producers wanted an adaptation that would introduce new characters. Both Kinberg and Shuler Donner said that they wanted characters with visuals and powers {{that had not been}} seen and that worked well as an ensemble, even if they did not work together in the comics. Shuler Donner later said that the original idea was to green-light First Class depending on the success of X-Men Origins: Magneto. That project was seeking approval to film in Washington, D.C., [...] and by December 2008, Goyer said filming would begin if [...] was successful. The story was moved forward to 1962, and involves Xavier and Magneto battling a villain.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning {{wrote that}} the NBC/Comcast reference here [...] "wasn't exactly a well of laughs, but Baldwin's Donaghy kept the story entertaining enough to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> it." [...] He enjoyed Banks' appearance, noting that her standout moment came when Avery and Jack argued over the direction of NBC [...] "and for that brief moment Banks stole the show from Baldwin." [...] In conclusion, Canning gave it an 8 out of 10 rating. James Poniewozik of Time magazine said that the main story [...] "played more like a subplot even though it gave the episode its title". He added {{that there were some}} fine moments, and that overall Liz and Jack's plots [...] "have the potential to give the show some interesting forward movement". Los Angeles Times contributor Meredith Blake felt that Michael Sheen was [...] "underused" [...] in his role, and observed that Jack and Avery's relationship showcased here seemed [...] "remarkably convincing." [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger {{wrote that the}} episode's storytelling was [...] "better than it's been in recent weeks", however, was not complimentary towards Liz meeting Sheen's Wesley, as he felt that their plot fell flat.|$|E
