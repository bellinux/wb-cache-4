40|$|Background: The high {{prevalence}} of anemia pregnant women anemia in Indonesia reaches 50 %– 70 %, {{and it is}} caused by many factors. First, it {{may be caused by}} low compliance of iron supplementation and second, it may be caused by bad distribution of iron supplementation. This prevalence results some effect: high maternal mortality rate, neonatal mortality rate, anemia in infancy, and low productivity. One solution to overcome this prevalence is by giving iron supplementation to pregnant women <b>with</b> <b>husband’s</b> supervision. Objective: This study aims {{to examine the relationship between}} iron supplementation with compliance, Hb value, and average of age gestation under husband’s supervision. Methods: This was quasi experimental non-equivalent control group design. Subjects were pregnant women aged 20 – 28 weeks whose hemoglobin level 8 gr/dl to 15 gr/dl. Subject were taken from three sub-districts of Bantul District, Special Teritory of Yogyakarta. Subject were divided into two groups, the first group (n= 55) received 60 mg iron supplementation <b>with</b> <b>husband’s</b> supervision and the second group (n= 65) received 60 mg iron supplementation without husband’s supervision. Results: The compliance of first the group was higher than the second group (x 2 = 19, 48 p 0, 05). In the second group, iron supplementation was also effective to increase Hb level and it is statistically significant (p< 0, 05). The difference of Hb level between two groups was insignifi cant. After the predictor variable was controlled using multivariate regression test, it showed that iron supplementation <b>with</b> <b>husband’s</b> supervision was effective to increased Hb level 0, 8 gr/dl and statistically signifi cant (p< 0, 05). The gestation average of two groups was similar, but after predictor variable was controlled using multivariate test, it showed that iron supplementation <b>with</b> <b>husband’s</b> supervision had one week gestation longer than those group without husband’s supervision.
