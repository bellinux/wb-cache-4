25|$|The 1,000-man {{battalion}} of the Loyal Lusitanian Legion sustained losses of three officers and 103 men killed, five officers and 143 men wounded, and 15 men missing. Militia losses were not stated. The dismounted gun was abandoned. French losses are unknown. Victor saw for himself that Mayne's small force {{was not the}} threat he had supposed. The French pressed {{only a few miles}} beyond Alcántara, but this alarmed Mackenzie who believed he was about to be attacked. Wellesley reassured his subordinate that he had nothing to <b>worry</b> <b>about,</b> <b>that</b> Victor could not spare enough soldiers to present a real threat to his position behind the Zêzere River. After spending three days near Alcántara, Victor withdrew to Torremocha. While Victor was away, Cuesta sent a force against Mérida. The raid failed to dislodge two battalions of Jean Francois Leval's German division from a fortified convent.|$|E
25|$|In July 2010, Jim McGuinness, {{the then}} under-21 manager, was {{appointed}} as county senior manager, succeeding John Joe Doherty. McGuinness guided the county's under-21 {{side to the}} All-Ireland Under 21 Football Championship final in 2010. He {{was appointed to the}} senior management on a four-year term, with a review after two years. His first year in charge brought Donegal the National Football League Division 2 title, promotion to Division 1, the county's first championship win in four years, the county's first provincial title in 19 years, and made Donegal the third team {{in the history of the}} GAA to win a Provincial Title from the Preliminary Round. His second season brought a second consecutive provincial title, also achieved from the Preliminary Round, as well as a defeat of the mighty Kerry at Croke Park and with the win over Cork on 26 August to secure a place in the 2012 All Ireland Football Final, it looks like Jim won't have to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> review after all.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer and {{directed}} by Jeffrey Lynch. Mike Reiss, show runner of The Simpsons with Al Jean at the time, said Meyer wrote most of the episode by himself without help from the show's other writers. Few changes {{were made to the}} first draft that he pitched to the producers; it was near identical to the final script. The episode was inspired by the vocational tests taken by several members of the show's staff when they went to school; Reiss, for example, said he was told he would become a librarian. Jean said [...] "one of the first things that sold us on doing the episode" [...] was the idea of Bart becoming a policeman. He said it was [...] "a funny, realistic depiction of what a kid like Bart might wind up to become, and it wasn't something you would immediately think of." [...] Jean said the episode deals with the emotion that many adults feel when they grow older and realize that {{they are not going to}} achieve the dreams they once had. [...] " [...] how people in life cope with that problem. Maybe Lisa, at eight years old, is a little bit young to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> but that's what we were trying to explore here." ...|$|E

I'm black; so what I do is black. Once you don't <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> you're free to manifest your artistry however you see it." [...] Van Peebles' lyrics range from lighter, humorous themes to more socially conscious material, such as [...] "Just Don't Make Sense", which focuses on the contradictions of the African American experience.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the show's airing, {{interviews}} with O'Brien and Richter {{indicated that the}} show would more closely represent Late Night than Tonight in regard to content and material, meaning that edgier or questionable content excised {{as a result of}} the move to the earlier time slot will no longer be an issue at TBS. On the July 12, 2010 episode of Marc Maron's WTF podcast, Andy Richter said that they no longer have to [...] "worry about living up to a respected franchise", and that on The Tonight Show certain sketches [...] "that just felt too 12:30" [...] would be cut and how [...] "it'll be nice to not have to <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> anymore". [...] During an appearance at the 2010 San Francisco Sketch Comedy Festival, O'Brien told the audience he was [...] "no longer interested in 'broadening' the audience or trying to reach everybody of all ages," [...] further implying the content will not be toned-down. As the show is on cable, fewer restrictions will apply to the show in regards to explicit content, such as swearing and racier material.|$|E

2500|$|The {{second half}} of the season saw Oliver face public furore after he was {{involved}} in separate on-field incidents. At the half-time break of the round fourteen match against West Coast, he was hit by West Coast's Will Schofield in which Schofield was immediately reported and consequently charged by the match review panel for striking. Oliver was publicly criticised by fans for [...] "staging" [...] and [...] "diving" [...] along with former Australian Test cricketer, Damien Martyn, tweeting [...] "am I watching soccer???" [...] in relation to the incident, to which Oliver responded on Twitter [...] "hey Damien, you should just <b>worry</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> shot in 1994. #amiwatchingachoker" [...] in reference to a batting shot against South Africa in the 1994 Sydney Test match which eventually saw Australia narrowly losing to South Africa. Former Richmond player, Matthew Richardson, publicly defended Oliver amid claims he was a stager by saying [...] "unless you're the one who's received that contact, how do you really know ... he seems like a straight-up, honest kid". Schofield successfully appealed the original charge after arguing that while [...] "he intended to strike Oliver and hit him with his forearm to the chin, the contact was so negligible it was not sufficient for a report". Two weeks later during the round sixteen match against , Oliver confronted a Carlton supporter who was sitting in the front row of the Melbourne Cricket Ground after the supporter had yelled something at him over the fence. He was publicly condemned by former players including Leigh Matthews and Nick Dal Santo who stated players needed to ignore the crowd during matches and not confront them.|$|E
