50|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>corals</b> have {{a bright}} yellow-green and brown {{skeletal}} covering and are widely distributed in tropical and subtropical waters. They appear in small brush-like growths on rocks and coral. Divers often mistake <b>fire</b> <b>coral</b> for seaweed, and accidental contact is common. Upon contact, an intense pain can be felt that can last from {{two days to}} two weeks. The very small nematocysts on <b>fire</b> <b>corals</b> contain tentacles that protrude from numerous surface pores (similar to jellyfish stings). In addition, <b>fire</b> <b>corals</b> have a sharp, calcified external skeleton that can scrape the skin.|$|R

25|$|An {{example of}} {{commensalism}} occurs between the hawkfish and <b>fire</b> <b>coral.</b> Thanks to their large, skinless pectoral fins, hawkfish can perch on <b>fire</b> <b>corals</b> without harm. <b>Fire</b> <b>corals</b> {{are not true}} corals, but are hydrozoans possessing stinging cells called nematocysts which would normally prevent close contact. The protection <b>fire</b> <b>corals</b> offer hawkfish means the hawkfish has the high ground of the reef, and can safely survey its surroundings like a hawk. Hawkfish usually stay motionless, but dart out and grab crustaceans and other small invertebrates as they pass by. They are mostly solitary, although some species form pairs and share a head of coral.|$|R
5|$|Corals' {{many colors}} give it appeal for {{necklaces}} and other jewelry. Intensely red coral is prized as a gemstone. Sometimes called <b>fire</b> <b>coral,</b> {{it is not}} the same as <b>fire</b> <b>coral.</b> Red coral is very rare because of overharvesting.|$|R
50|$|Most <b>fire</b> <b>coral</b> {{species have}} brittle skeletons {{that can easily}} be broken, for example, during storms, or by divers when diving for leisure, or when {{collecting}} fish for the aquarium trade. For instance, the yellowtail damselfish (Chrysiptera parasema) tends to dwell close to the branching <b>fire</b> <b>coral</b> colonies, and retreats into its branches when threatened. In Brazil, <b>fire</b> <b>coral</b> colonies are extensively damaged when harvesting the yellowtail damselfish, as the corals are often deliberately smashed and fishes hiding amongst the branches are ‘shaken out’ into plastic bags.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>corals</b> are colonial coral-like {{organisms that}} secrete {{calcareous}} skeletons. Colonies of Millepora complanata have an encrusting base and thin upright plates or blades growing to {{a height of}} about 50 cm. The surface of the blades is smooth and the outer margins irregular, with many stumpy protrusions. This <b>fire</b> <b>coral</b> is pale brown or cream coloured, with white tips to the blades. The feeding and defensive polyps are hair-like and project through fine pores {{on the surface of}} the blades. Contact with this <b>fire</b> <b>coral</b> by bare skin can cause a severe stinging sensation.|$|R
500|$|It {{has been}} found that when Millepora alcicornis grows in close {{proximity}} to an arborescent gorgonian sea fan, the <b>fire</b> <b>coral</b> becomes aggressive. It produces [...] "attack" [...] branches which grow out sideways towards the sea fan, develop into hand-like structures and encircle and smother it. The <b>fire</b> <b>coral</b> then uses it as a substrate for new growth. Sometimes this new growth gets separated from the parent colony, and a new colony of <b>fire</b> <b>coral</b> is formed, genetically identical to the original one. This aggressive action is specific to gorgonians and does not happen in response to the close presence of other live or dead corals, other sessile invertebrates or open water. The <b>fire</b> <b>coral</b> seems to be able to detect the gorgonian's presence as a result of water flowing over the surfaces of both.|$|R

50|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>coral</b> {{has several}} common growth forms; these include branching, plate, and encrusting. Branching adopts a calcerious {{structure}} which branches off, to rounded, finger-like tips. Plate growth adopts a shape {{similar to that}} of the smaller nonsheet lettuce corals - erect, thin sheets, which group together to form a colony. In encrusting growth, the <b>fire</b> <b>coral</b> forms on the calcerious structure of other coral or gorgonian structures.|$|R

50|$|Because {{of their}} large, {{skinless}} pectoral fins, hawkfishes {{are able to}} perch upon <b>fire</b> <b>corals</b> without incurring harm. Actually hydrozoans rather than true <b>corals,</b> <b>fire</b> <b>corals</b> possess stinging cells (nematocysts), which would normally prevent close contact. Afforded some degree of protection by their living perches, hawkfishes seek the high ground of the reef, where they warily survey their surroundings like hawks. This {{is said to have}} inspired their common name.|$|R
50|$|Reproduction in <b>fire</b> <b>corals</b> is {{more complex}} than in other reef-building corals. The polyps {{reproduce}} asexually, producing jellyfish-like medusae, which are released into the water from special cup-like structures known as ampullae. The medusae contain the reproductive organs that release eggs and sperm into the water. Fertilised eggs develop into free-swimming larvae that will eventually settle on the substrate and form new colonies. <b>Fire</b> <b>corals</b> can also reproduce asexually by fragmentation.|$|R

A total of 3651 colonies of <b>fire</b> <b>corals</b> were mappedand measured over 45, 000 m 2 of surveyed reef.

The size structure varied among reefhabitats with higher proportions of larger colonies in calm nearshore reefs (fringing andpatch reefs), while populations were dominated by smaller colonies in the exposed forereefs. The highest densities of <b>fire</b> <b>corals</b> were recorded in fore reef habitats (0. 12 ± 0. 20 n. m- 2) where the proportion of recruits and juveniles was higher at mid slope populations(49. 3 %) than on the upper slope near where waves break (29. 0 %).

50|$|S. pictus is a {{demersal}} fish and a territorial species, which guards {{an area of}} sea floor on which it grazes algae and eats detritus. It is often found associated with the <b>fire</b> <b>coral,</b> Millepora alcicornis. It is preyed upon by the trumpetfish, Aulostomus maculatus.|$|R
50|$|The polyps of <b>fire</b> <b>corals</b> {{are near}} {{microscopic}} size and are mostly {{embedded in the}} skeleton and connected by a network of minute canals. All that is visible on the smooth surface are pores of two sizes: gastropores and dactylopores. In fact, Millepora means ‘thousand pores’. Dactylozooids have long fine hairs that protrude from the skeleton. The hairs possess clusters of stinging cells and capture prey, which is then engulfed by gastrozooids, or feeding polyps, situated within the gastropores. As well as capturing prey, <b>fire</b> <b>corals</b> gain nutrients via their special symbiotic relationship with algae known as zooxanthellae. The zooxanthellae live inside the tissues of the coral, and provide the coral with food, which they produce through photosynthesis, so require sunlight. In return, the coral provides the algae with protection and access to sunlight.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>corals</b> {{are found}} on reefs in the Indian, Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans and the Caribbean Sea.

40|$|The {{characterization}} of the non-protein constituents of two species of <b>fire</b> <b>corals</b> Millepora dichotoma and Millepora platyphylla, exhibits very interesting results. The compounds were identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The solvent extracts of the two species revealed four wax esters. The compounds were identified as C 30 H 60 O 2, C 32 H 64 O 2, C 34 H 68 O 2 and C 36 H 72 O 2 respectively. The presence of these compounds has been reported previously in different marine organisms {{as well as in}} marine samples. It is interesting that there were some variations in the number and nature of isomers of similar wax esters reported earlier. Long-chain wax esters are normally waxy in nature and their presence in <b>fire</b> <b>coral</b> plays a vital role in the nutrient transfer to the coral mass. They may also act as a protective coating of the nematocyst of dactylozooid. The coral species were also subjected to mild acidic hydrolysis, followed by neutralization and partitioning between water and ether. The organic phase was dried and purified by column chromatography and thin layer chromatography (TLC). Diphenylamine was revealed as the main product in one of the fractions. It is worth noting that diphenylamine is reported {{for the first time as}} a marine natural product. Diphenylamine is known to be toxic and causes allergic reactions to the skin, so it can be considered as responsible for the stinging property of <b>fire</b> <b>coral...</b>|$|R
