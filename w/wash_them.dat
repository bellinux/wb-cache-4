5|$|Marsden reappears on Albert Square in 2009 when Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb) is murdered. She {{arrives on}} the scene when several people say they suspect Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), but Marsden waits before {{questioning}} her, and questions the Mitchells first. She makes a televised appeal for witnesses and later interviews Phil, but he is provided an alibi by his girlfriend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry). A few days later, a red fingernail is found {{at the scene of}} the murder; Marsden visits the female locals, checking their hands. Seeing an upset Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), knowing that she is vulnerable and lives with Shirley, she talks to Heather about Christmas Day and Heather accidentally tells Marsden that Phil wasn't there. Marsden interviews Phil and later visits his home, asking to see the clothes he was wearing on Christmas Day. Shirley shows her a clean shirt; Marsden closes the laundrette, hoping anyone with blood-stained clothes will not be able to <b>wash</b> <b>them.</b> After a tip-off Marsden arrests Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook); Sam accuses her mother, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), of the murder. Marsden confirms that she was there to talk to Peggy, questioning Peggy and Sam at the police station. Peggy is released without charge; however, Sam is detained for jumping bail. Marsden visits Janine, who insists that people will say anything to get her in trouble. She asks Janine why she was out in the cold on Christmas Day, and asks if Janine knows where Archie's laptop as it had gone missing.|$|E
25|$|Bumastus {{could also}} curl up (known as enrollment) into a ball-like shape. This is {{believed}} to indicate that its habitat {{might have been the}} shallow waters of the Littoral zone. When waves <b>wash</b> <b>them</b> out from the sediments it could simply roll up and be carried along. Enrollment protects the softer body parts below the exoskeleton, while the spherical shape offers the least resistance to wave action.|$|E
25|$|When saying Kiddush, {{the blessing}} over the wine (or over the bread) precedes the blessing over the day. One {{does not need}} to wash his hands before saying Kiddush but he should <b>wash</b> <b>them</b> after. The towel used to wash one's hands should not be placed on the table, lest it and {{anything}} that comes into contact with it be rendered ritually unclean. Following the meal, all the crumbs in the dining room should be thoroughly swept up, then those involved should wash their hands.|$|E

25|$|Spectra {{were taken}} at Keck {{corresponding}} to 20, 25, and 26 days after maximum {{light in the}} B-band. So little evolution was observed between these spectra {{that they were all}} combined in order to increase the signal-to-noise ratio and study less pronounced features. Fe II still dominates the spectrum. The Ca II infrared triplet is weak in SN 2002cx as compared to other type Ia supernovae, as expected since the Ca II H & K line is also weak in SN 2002cx. Unlike other type Ia supernova, SN 2002cx has double-peaked emission lines which may be due to jet-like emissions or rotating ejecta, or may simply only be seen in SN 2002cx because its low expansion velocity does not <b>wash</b> <b>them</b> out. The emission or ejecta hypothesis is considered less likely because if it were the case all the peaks should share equal separation, which they do not. SN 2002cx has absorption and emission lines between 6400 Å and 7000 Å that are unique among previously discovered type Ia supernovae.|$|E
500|$|Scrub typhus {{was spread}} by mites {{that lived in}} the soil. Soldiers walking through mite-infested areas were fairly safe, but if they sat or lay down or stood still for long enough, the mites could attach themselves. Although the {{incidence}} of typhus was much {{less than that of}} malaria or dysentery, it was more lethal. Of 2,839 Australian servicemen affected in SWPA, 9.05% died. Scrub itch, a skin irritation caused by mite bites, was a more common but far less serious ailment. Tinea was also a problem, due to the inability of men to keep their clothes or boots dry, or to <b>wash</b> <b>them.</b> A shortage of fresh fruit and vegetables caused vitamin-deficiency-related problems. To save weight and simplify the distribution [...] of rations, the 7th Division staff cut back the number of commodities in the ration from thirteen (bully beef, biscuits, tea, sugar, salt, dried fruit, jam, butter, milk, cheese, tinned fruit, tinned vegetables and bacon) to just the first six. Inevitably, both the troops and the carriers began to suffer from vitamin deficiencies as well as exhaustion and illness. To supplement the carriers' vitamin B intake, marmite was air dropped for them, but only [...] was available.|$|E
2500|$|They have {{sensitive}} skin, and shampoo (canine or human) {{may cause}} allergic reactions; therefore, {{it is best}} to <b>wash</b> <b>them</b> with a gentle dog shampoo, and not a human shampoo (as humans require a different pH than dogs [...] ). Grooming Pharaohs is as easy as a quick rub with a hound glove or a damp cloth. They are clean dogs, shed very little, and have no noticeable odour, except when wet or when they've been outside; but their odour quickly returns to normal.|$|E

2500|$|The {{records of}} St Leonard {{provide the best}} details of daily {{hospital}} worship and patient life. In 1249, for example, matins and lauds were said in the morning hours of darkness, followed by mass of the Virgin Mary held {{by members of the}} clergy. The [...] "lesser hours and mass of the day were said at mid-morning, vespers in the afternoon and compline in the early evening after supper." [...] Sisters at St. Leonard's were instructed to feed the poor and the sick, <b>wash</b> <b>them,</b> and lead them around the grounds. Although the food given to the sick were the simple, and often quite cheap, daily provisions, sisters were allowed to distribute special food if they were very ill.|$|E
2500|$|In Drake's journal, Parker learns Drake {{had also}} been dreaming of the metal object flying through space; [...] "The fire burns across the sky as the comet plunges into the sea. The water boils with rage and hate. He is furious. He is alone, {{confused}} and afraid. Like a lost child, he is scared {{of the loss of}} guidance, and fears for his young mind." [...] Of Shaw and Woolfe, he writes [...] "they must be taken, and broken, and washed away. Take them from this place, and down to sea, <b>wash</b> <b>them</b> away." [...] Drake says that when Parker arrives on the island, it will be [...] "time for the final Dark Fall," [...] and claims his [...] "master" [...] owns the island but desperately wants to leave.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the rain}} began Roberts moved {{along the edge}} of the rubber {{plantation}} north-east of Long Phuoc in column towards the heavily swollen Suoi Da Bang. The terracing of the paddy fields resulted in a steep drop to the creek and a difficult climb out; however, using a bullock track alongside a dam he had previously utilised during Operation Hardihood, Roberts began to swim the carriers across the water despite the fast moving current which threatened to <b>wash</b> <b>them</b> downstream. At 18:10 Roberts was ordered for a second time to halt and wait for Townsend. Yet he continued to monitor D Company's situation over the radio and again chose to disregard the order. Mollison concurred, agreeing not to stop for Townsend to catch up, and they proceeded to cross the creek. After completing the dangerous crossing without incident, Roberts left one carrier and its infantry to secure the point and to act as a guide for Townsend, while the remaining seven APCs continued to move towards the battle. Advancing another , the relief force reached the junction of Route 52 and the road running north-west through the rubber plantation by 18:20. The road led directly to the scene of the fighting, and using it as his centre axis, Roberts deployed one section of three APCs on the right commanded by Sergeant Ron Richards and one on the left under Sergeant Leslie O'Reilly, each with two vehicles forward and one back evenly spaced [...] apart, while he remained in the centre moving astride the road. At 18:22 they began to advance on a [...] frontage, only to again be ordered by radio to halt and wait for Townsend. With sunset due at 19:11 and darkness already beginning to fall due to the heavy rain clouds overhead, Roberts once more decided to press on.|$|E

6000|$|... [Picture: Washing line] We stayed {{two days}} at Streatley, and got our clothes washed.

Indeed, it had been more than a failure, because we were worse off after we had washed our clothes than we were before. Before we had <b>washed</b> <b>them,</b> they had been very, very dirty, it is true; but they were just wearable. After we had washed them—well, the river between Reading and Henley was much cleaner, after we had washed our clothes in it, than it was before. All the dirt {{contained}} in the river between Reading and Henley, we collected, during that wash, and worked it into our clothes.|$|R
