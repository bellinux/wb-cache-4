25|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, younger Hong Kong workers began {{avoiding}} the manufacturing industry entirely. Hong Kong's on-going evolution away from manufacturing picked up steam during the decade, as production's {{share of the}} economy fell from 22.8% in 1980 to 16.7% ten years later. Replacing it was a greater reliance on services, which rose from 68.3% to 75.4% of GDP. The fastest growing sectors were foreign trade, logistics and communications and general personal and community services. The lack of investment in domestic industry, along with China's economic reform, began opening up manufacturing to the mainland.

25|$|In 1779, as a {{practical}} solution to end slavery, Jefferson supported gradual emancipation, training, and colonization of African-American slaves rather than unconditional manumission, believing that releasing unprepared slaves <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> go and no means to support themselves would only bring them misfortune. In 1784, Jefferson proposed federal legislation banning slavery in the New Territories of the North and South after 1800, which failed to pass Congress by one vote. In his Notes on the State of Virginia, published in 1785, Jefferson expressed the beliefs that slavery corrupted both masters and slaves alike, supported colonization of freed slaves, suspected that African-Americans were inferior in intelligence, and that emancipating large numbers of slaves made slave uprisings more likely. In 1794 and 1796, Jefferson manumitted by deed two of his male slaves; they had been trained and were qualified to hold employment.|$|E

The wild South Florida real estate boom had collapsed in mid 1926, and the Great Miami Hurricane struck on 18 September, killing more than 325 and leaving as many as 50,000 residents homeless, while causing some $100 million damage (just over $2 billion in 2005 dollars). <b>With</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> put the aging ship, IMM [...] Kroonland in Hoboken.|$|E

500|$|Eventually, Jack enters Ryan's {{personal}} office, where Ryan is patiently {{waiting for}} Jack by casually playing golf. Ryan explains he fully knew of Atlas' plan, and explains that Jack is his illegitimate child, {{taken from his}} mother by Fontaine who placed him out of Ryan's reach on the surface, and genetically modified to age rapidly. Fontaine had planned to use Jack as a trump card in his war with Ryan, bringing him back to Rapture when the time was right; Jack's genetics {{would allow him to}} access systems such as the bathysphere that Ryan had locked out long ago. <b>With</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> run, Ryan is willing to accept death by his own free will, quoting one of his own principles: [...] "A man chooses. A slave obeys." [...] He asks Jack [...] "would you kindly" [...] kill him with the golf club, and Jack is compelled to do so. As Ryan dies, Jack becomes aware that the phrase [...] "would you kindly" [...] has preceded many of Atlas' commands as a hypnotic trigger forcing him to follow Atlas' orders without question; a flashback reveals Jack himself was responsible for crashing his plane near the lighthouse after reading a letter containing the trigger phrase. Atlas reveals himself as Fontaine, having used the Atlas alias to hide himself while providing a figure for the lower class to rally behind. Without Ryan, Fontaine takes over control of Ryan's systems, and leaves Jack to die as he releases hostile security drones into Ryan's locked office.|$|E

Elsewhere, she's simply undressed <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> go". Richard Harrington from The Washington Post gave the book a mixed review by saying: [...] "Is Sex shocking? not really. Mostly because it's Madonna, and somehow we've come to expect this from her. Is Sex boring? surprisingly, yes". During her review of the book, British author Zoë Heller from The Independent wrote that it was [...] "the women who once saw Madonna as a witty feminist role model who have been most alarmist about her latest pornographic incarnation" [...] and that [...] "previously, they say, Madonna played with traditional images of feminine sexuality in a subversive, 'empowering' way. But now, with sado-masochism and rape fantasies, she has gone too far." [...] Calvin Tomkins, author and art critic for The New Yorker, wrote that [...] "unfortunately, the book {{is going to be}} mistaken for pornography". Vanity Fair deemed it [...] "the dirtiest coffee table book to ever be published". Caryn James from The New York Times was negative in her review stating that [...] "There is plenty here to offend the meek (whips and chains), the self-righteous (gay men and lesbians), not to mention the tasteful (a tacky and cluttered art design)". Vicki Goldberg from the same newspaper was also dismissive of the photography of the book saying that [...] "Unfortunately, not many of the images are very good photographically.

500|$|Talbot is Marlowe's {{right-hand}} {{man and the}} secondary antagonist of Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception. He is voiced by Robin Atkin Downes. He {{is the one who}} hired Charlie Cutter to provide security for the deal in the first level. He has an intense rivalry with Nathan Drake and, according to the developers, acts as the [...] "anti-Drake", with similar looks and free running skills to rival Drake's own. Talbot is always by Marlowe's side, and later orders Cutter to shoot Nate and Sully. Despite his unassuming appearance, he is an extremely dangerous hand-to-hand combatant, able to use a combat knife with high proficiency as seen in his final confrontation with Drake and Sully in the collapsing city of Ubar. He also has a special weapon: a dart gun loaded with a special drug which grants him some hypnotic influence over people (he uses it to make Cutter disarm himself). Despite being treated with near indifference, he appears to care deeply for Marlowe, begging Nathan to save her from being consumed by the quicksand in Ubar, and is driven mad when Drake fails. He tries to murder Drake on top of a collapsing cliff overlooking the Iram of the pillars but is briefly distracted by Sully who shoots him in the shoulder with a Walther P99. He is then finally killed by Drake who puts several bullets into him before he can flatten Sully's skull with a rock, and plummets to his death. He is an expert at mind control and seems capable of appearing and disappearing almost at will and surviving being shot at point blank. However, due to his mind tricks, it is difficult to tell for sure if he can appear out of nowhere or disappear at will and sustain much bullet damage. After brainwashing Cutter, he manages to vanish before {{the rest of the team}} arrive. Cutter shoots him at point blank, but he does not appear to suffer much from it. He manages to attack Sully by surprise on a walkway <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> sneak behind him. He manages to catch up with Drake and Sully when the whole place collapses - which is either possible thanks to his free running abilities or his unexplained ability to appear and disappear almost at will.|$|E

2500|$|By {{the end of}} the summer, the Haight-Ashbury scene had deteriorated. The incessant media {{coverage}} led the Diggers to declare the [...] "death" [...] of the hippie with a parade. According to poet Susan 'Stormi' Chambless, the hippies buried an effigy of a hippie in the Panhandle to demonstrate the end of his/her reign. Haight-Ashbury could not accommodate the influx of crowds (mostly naive youngsters) <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> live. Many took to living on the street, panhandling and drug-dealing. There were problems with malnourishment, disease, and drug addiction. Crime and violence skyrocketed. None of these trends reflected what the hippies had envisioned. By the end of 1967, many of the hippies and musicians who initiated the Summer of Love had moved on. Beatle George Harrison had once visited Haight-Ashbury and found it to be just a haven for dropouts, inspiring him to give up LSD. Misgivings about the hippie culture, particularly with regard to drug abuse and lenient morality, fueled the moral panics of the late 1960s.|$|E
2500|$|Craven {{chose to}} give Iliadis his freedom while filming the remake, {{partially}} because Craven {{was in the}} process of working on a new film for himself, but also because he likes to allow the directors the chance to make their own film. For the 2009 remake, Iliadis wanted to keep a consistency among the scenes of his film, as compared to the 1972 original. Iliadis stated that he felt the intercutting of comedic scenes with the rape scene in the 1972 film had the tendency to take one out of the moment. Iliadis wanted to [...] "cut those diversions out", as a way of [...] " [...] into this scene <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> cut away to". For Iliadis, taking this approach helped to create more drama for the event. The producers brought in a medical technician to provide insight, based on his job experience witnessing the people's deaths, and lend realism to the actors' portrayals. Lindhome states that the technician would explain how someone would react given a particular event, like getting shot or stabbed. Iliadis also felt that his work on Hardcore helped to train him for this film. As the director points out, Hardcore contained [...] "very difficult scenes", like a sixteen-year-old girl having an [...] "existential breakdown during an orgy", and Iliadis sees those scenes as training for him to learn how to make sure the actors are still being respected, as well as making sure that the scene is focused on the characters instead of simply going for [...] "titillation".|$|E

She also played the character [...] "Elida" [...] at Den Nationale Scene in Bergen in 1912. In 1912 she visited London and Paris, visits that were influential for her later role as stage director. In London she fell under the spell of Gordon Craig, admiring his theories on theatrical design, such as stage composition and use of light. In Paris she was particularly inspired by Charles Dullin, and his way of interweaving drama with music and painting. In the 1910s she participated in a few Danish films. One of these was the short film Proletargeniet from 1914, where she played the wife of a professor.
