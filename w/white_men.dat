5|$|Following the bombing, French Gabonese {{made more}} {{threatening}} {{phone calls to}} the embassy. A second bomb exploded at the embassy two nights later, causing no damage. A drive-by shooting, during which at least five rounds of buckshot were fired from a 12-gauge automatic shotgun, riddled the second story windows with over 30 holes. It is likely that its perpetrators were French, as Gabonese {{have no access to}} grenades. Following the second bombing a car containing <b>white</b> <b>men</b> was noticed, driving through otherwise empty Shore Boulevard. At the time, practically the only <b>white</b> <b>men</b> in Gabon were French.|$|E

5|$|Mala and the Eskimos go {{bowhead whale}} hunting in wooden boats and with {{harpoons}} {{provided by the}} <b>white</b> <b>men,</b> and an actual whale hunt and carcass slaughtering is depicted on film. After the successful hunt, two drunken <b>white</b> <b>men</b> kidnap Aba (and prevent Mala from rescuing her) and force her to get drunk. The ship captain rapes Aba, who escapes at dawn. The Captain's Mate, hunting seals with a rifle, mistakes Aba (passed out on the ice) for an animal and kills her. Mala kills the ship captain with a harpoon (mistakenly believing the captain shot his wife). He flees back to his village with his children.|$|E

5|$|Southern Rhodesia {{had contributed}} more {{manpower}} to the Allied cause in World War II, proportional to white population, {{than any other}} British dominion or colony, and more than the UK itself. According to figures compiled by MacDonald for his War History of Southern Rhodesia, 26,121 Southern Rhodesians served {{in the armed forces}} during the conflict, of whom 2,758 were commissioned officers. Broken down by race and gender, there were 15,153 black men, 9,187 <b>white</b> <b>men,</b> 1,510 white women and 271 coloured and Indian men.

5|$|At the Detroit council, DePeyster {{encouraged}} the Indians to unite and {{to send a}} force to oppose Clark's expedition. In May 1781, Indian leaders and Indian Department officials began to gather warriors at the Wyandot town of Upper Sandusky for this purpose. In mid-August, Brant and George Girty, Simon's brother, headed south to the Ohio River with about 90 Iroquois, Shawnee, and Wyandot warriors, {{as well as a}} few <b>white</b> <b>men,</b> while McKee and Simon Girty continued to collect reinforcements.|$|E

5|$|St. Leger's {{artillery}} {{was held}} up by a tactic that was also used to slow down Burgoyne's army {{after the fall of}} Ticonderoga: Gansevoort and his men had systematically felled trees across the wooded track the expedition came down, and St. Leger needed to clear the track to make way for his artillery. This work occupied all but 250 of St. Leger's <b>white</b> <b>men,</b> with the actual encirclement of the fort dominated by Indians.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after the war began, the Chartered Company formed the Rhodesian Reserves, an {{amorphous}} entity intended to accommodate the many <b>white</b> <b>men</b> who were keen to put on uniform, as well as to make a start towards organising what might eventually become an expeditionary force. Eminent citizens and elected leaders formed their own platoons, each bringing 24 volunteers; three or four of these 25-man troops made a company. Units representing the Caledonian Society, the Lancashire and Yorkshire Society, the Legion of Frontiersmen and other local organisations mirrored the Pals battalions in Britain. Volunteers could opt to serve overseas, within Rhodesia or only locally; around 1,000 had volunteered in all by 13 August.|$|E

During World War I, 49% of A graduates were in military service, and in 1918, the senior class was mustered into military service to fight in France. During World War II, Texas A produced over 20,000 combat troops, contributing more officers than both the United States Military Academy and United States Naval Academy combined.|$|E

The 1926 Miami Hurricane and the Great Depression of the 1930s caused {{a great deal of}} economic dislocation. In July 1935, an African-American man named Rubin Stacy was accused of robbing a white woman at knife point. He was arrested and being transported to a Miami jail when police were run off the road by a mob. A group of 100 <b>white</b> <b>men</b> proceeded to hang Stacy from a tree near the scene of his alleged robbery. His body was riddled with some twenty bullets. The murder was subsequently used by the press in Nazi Germany to discredit US critiques of its own persecution of Jews, Communists, and Catholics.|$|E

5|$|In many early western {{films and}} literature, Native Americans were often portrayed as savages; having {{conflicts}} and battles against gunfighters and white settlements.

5|$|On March 29, Confederate {{president}} Jefferson Davis {{called on}} the Confederate Congress to pass a conscription bill. The bill would require a three-year term of service for all able-bodied <b>white</b> <b>men</b> {{between the ages of}} 18 and 35. At first, the bill was unpopular, but as the military situation grew more desperate for the Confederacy, both houses quickly passed it. Still, the measure caused some to question Davis' military decisions; among them was Burnett, usually one of Davis' staunchest allies. In an April 19, 1862 address to the legislature, Burnett denounced Davis' preference for those who were, like Davis himself, graduates of West Point. The speech drew such a vigorous positive response from the gallery that some of the most zealous had to be removed.|$|E
5|$|The Democratic Party Tammany Hall {{political}} machine {{had been working}} to enroll immigrants as U.S. citizens so they could vote in local elections and had strongly recruited Irish, most of whom already spoke English.

In New York City and other locations, new citizens learned {{they were expected to}} register for the draft to fight for their new country.
