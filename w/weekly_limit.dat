40|$|Abstract Background There is {{consistent}} evidence that individuals in higher socioeconomic status groups {{are more likely}} to report exceeding recommended drinking limits, but those in lower socioeconomic status groups experience more alcohol-related harm. This has been called the ‘alcohol harm paradox’. Such studies typically use standard cut-offs to define heavy drinking, which are exceeded by a large proportion of adults. Our study pools data from six years (2008 – 2013) of the population-based Health Survey for England to test whether the socioeconomic distribution of more extreme levels of drinking could help explain the paradox. Methods The study included 51, 498 adults from a representative sample of the adult population of England for a cross-sectional analysis of associations between socioeconomic status and self-reported drinking. Heavy weekly drinking was measured at four thresholds, ranging from 112  g+/ 168  g[*]+[*](alcohol for women/men, or 14 / 21 UK standard units) to 680  g+/ 880  g[*]+[*](or 85 / 110 UK standard units) per week. Heavy episodic drinking was also measured at four thresholds, from 48  g+/ 64  g[*]+[*](or 6 / 8 UK standard units) to 192  g+/ 256  g[*]+[*](or 24 / 32 UK standard units) in one day. Socioeconomic status indicators were equivalised household income, education, occupation and neighbourhood deprivation. Results Lower socioeconomic status was associated with lower likelihoods of exceeding recommended limits for weekly and episodic drinking, and higher likelihoods of exceeding more extreme thresholds. For example, participants in routine or manual occupations had 0. 65 (95  % CI 0. 57 – 0. 74) times the odds of exceeding the recommended <b>weekly</b> <b>limit</b> compared to those in ‘higher managerial’ occupations, and 2. 15 (95  % CI 1. 06 – 4. 36) times the odds of exceeding the highest threshold. Similarly, participants in the lowest income quintile had 0. 60 (95  % CI 0. 52 – 0. 69) times the odds of exceeding the recommended <b>weekly</b> <b>limit</b> when compared to the highest quintile, and 2. 30 (95  % CI 1. 28 – 4. 13) times the odds of exceeding the highest threshold. Conclusions Low socioeconomic status groups {{are more likely to}} drink at extreme levels, which may partially explain the alcohol harm paradox. Policies that address alcohol-related health inequalities need to consider extreme drinking levels in some sub-groups that may be associated with multiple markers of deprivation. This will require a more disaggregated understanding of drinking practices...|$|E
40|$|AIMS The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} relationships between alcohol consumption and social mobility in a cohort study in Scotland. METHODS 1040 sons and 1298 daughters aged 30 - 59 from 1477 families reported their alcohol consumption from which was derived: weekly units (1 UK unit being 8 g ethanol), exceeding daily or weekly limits, binge drinking and consuming alcohol on 5 + days per week. Own and father's social class were available enabling social mobility to be investigated. RESULTS More downwardly mobile men exceeded the <b>weekly</b> <b>limit,</b> the daily limit, were defined as binge drinkers and drank the most units per week of the four social mobility groups. Stable non-manual women were more likely to consume alcohol on 5 + days a week but very few were binge drinkers. Stable non-manual and upwardly mobile men and women were more likely to drink wine, and downwardly mobile men to drink beer. CONCLUSIONS Downward mobility was associated with less favourable alcohol behaviours, especially in men. Wine consumption was more closely related to the social mobility groups than beer and spirits consumption. Drinking patterns could both influence and be influenced by social mobilit...|$|E
