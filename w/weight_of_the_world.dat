5|$|Atlas– A four-armed Titan who {{was imprisoned}} in Tartarus after the Great War. In Chains of Olympus, Atlas was freed by the goddess Persephone and {{captured}} the god Helios on her behalf. Persephone directed Atlas to use Helios' power {{to destroy the}} Pillar of the World. Atlas, however, was chained to the weakened pillar by Kratos, and was doomed to carry the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> on his shoulders forever. After Kratos defeated Persephone, Atlas mocked Kratos and his choice to defend the gods. In God of War II, Atlas and Kratos met again, and although he was initially bitter towards Kratos, Atlas decided to help him reach the Sisters of Fate, providing him with the magic, Atlas Quake, and stated that they would meet again. This would be Atlas' final appearance, however, leaving his fate unknown. The character was voiced by Michael Clarke Duncan in God of War II, and Fred Tatasciore in Chains of Olympus.|$|E
5|$|After {{locating}} the Temple of Persephone and confronting the Queen of the Underworld, Kratos {{is given a}} choice: renounce his power and be with his deceased daughter (at a cost to mankind) or proceed with his mission. Kratos sacrifices his weapons and power {{to be reunited with}} his daughter, but discovers that Persephone is embittered by Zeus' betrayal and her imprisonment in the Underworld with her husband Hades. While he was distracted by his reunion with Calliope, Persephone's ally Atlas was using the power of the kidnapped Helios to destroy the Pillar of the World, which would also end Olympus. Choosing to abandon Calliope forever, Kratos takes back his power and binds Atlas to the Pillar of the World he sought to destroy, forcing the Titan to hold the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> on his shoulders. Kratos then battles Persephone to the death. Although victorious, he is warned by a dying Persephone that his suffering will never end. Atlas also warns Kratos that he will eventually regret helping the gods and that he and Atlas will meet again. Kratos then rides the Sun Chariot back to the mortal world and into the sky as Morpheus retreats.|$|E

500|$|The finale {{introduces}} parallel-universe {{versions of}} familiar characters, including the Fauxlivia version of Olivia Dunham, both played by actress Anna Torv.

Names varied, with many using [...] "Fauxlivia", [...] "Bolivia", and/or [...] "Altlivia". The writers chose Fauxlivia because {{a character in a}} season three episode referred to her as such. Torv and Akiva Goldsman discussed various ways to differentiate the two depictions of Olivia; ultimately two different physical demeanors were created. Torv wanted to make the new character [...] "completely different", but she and Goldsman recognized that the two share some major similarities, as they both are in the same profession and are [...] "fundamentally, genetically really the same person." [...] According to Torv, Fauxlivia holds herself differently and has [...] "a different silhouette. She's got a little firefighter, a little military in her." [...] Torv further explained, [...] "Olivia wants to be the best, but [...] just wants to win;" [...] "There's just a front-footedness I think to , simply because she just doesn't carry the <b>weight</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> on her shoulders like Olivia does.

Pinkner describes shooting the Fauxlivia scenes in the DVD audio commentary: [...] "When [...] first showed up on set in this different guise, she had really embodied this other character in a very playful and sexy way. She turned a lot of heads." [...] Goldsman remarked that Torv's depiction of Fauxlivia was actually much closer to the actress' real personality than her performance as Olivia.
