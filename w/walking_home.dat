5|$|Sarah Mirk of The Portland Mercury {{attributed}} {{the rise in}} the recorded number of crimes related to gender or sexual identity in 2010 to the increased number of filed police reports, this {{due in part to the}} work of the Q Patrols.

According to Portland Police, eight bias crimes were reported between January 1 and April 30, 2011, half the number reported during the same period in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Gumball is {{an action}} video {{game for the}} home {{computer}} in which the player works in a factory as a gumball sorter and sorts gumballs by color as they flow through a maze-like processing machine. The player controls valves in the machine to divert the flow of individual gumballs towards bins of corresponding colors. If the player sorts incorrectly, the foreman walks onscreen and dumps the gumballs out the bin. The player has a daily quota to meet {{by the end of}} the level's time limit. If successful, the player character receives a promotion; the player watches an animation of a worker <b>walking</b> <b>home</b> from the factory, and progresses to a more complex level, with more color options to sort and defective, explosive gumballs to deactivate. If unsuccessful in meeting the daily quota, the game ends and the player is left to restart from the beginning.|$|E

5|$|Jonah Bevan (Oliver Ferriman) is <b>walking</b> <b>home</b> {{across the}} Cardiff Bay Barrage when a mysterious bright light appears. He vanishes. Seven months later, at the {{instigation}} {{of her former}} police colleague Andy Davidson (Tom Price), Torchwood agent Gwen Cooper (Eve Myles) is investigating Jonah's disappearance. After Jonah's mother Nikki (Ruth Jones) starts {{a support group for}} relatives of missing people in the Cardiff area, Gwen realises that there are more cases resembling Jonah's disappearance. Gwen collates a chart of the missing people and her colleague Toshiko (Naoko Mori) discovers that all the disappearances occurred during negative spikes of activity from the Cardiff space-time rift. The two women postulate the implications of this: that the rift can take people away and discard them elsewhere. Gwen confronts her boss Jack Harkness (John Barrowman) with her research but he informs her that nothing can be done and orders her to stop the investigation.|$|E
5|$|One {{day while}} Wayne is <b>walking</b> <b>home</b> {{in the rain}} and hail, Homer sees Wayne and he reluctantly agrees to let Homer drive him to Moe's Tavern for a drink. While Wayne is in the bathroom, Snake {{dramatically}} crashes through the door on his motorcycle to rob everyone. As soon as Wayne comes out, he soundly beats up Snake.

It is discovered that Wayne is a highly trained former CIA black ops agent, who decided to go into hiding in Springfield. He is plagued by recurring flashbacks from his previous missions, which cause him to act or shout them out, as evidenced when he unintentionally attacks Mr. Burns, the boss of the power plant, which results in Wayne being fired.|$|E

40|$|QuestionTo {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} of aerobic <b>walking</b> and <b>home</b> based quadriceps strengthening exercises in reducing pain and disability in knee osteoarthritis. DesignSystematic review of randomised controlled trials. Setting/populationPeople with knee osteoarthritis. InterventionsComparison of aerobic <b>walking</b> or <b>home</b> based quadriceps strengthening exercise with a non-exercise control group. Strengthening exercise {{was considered to be}} ‘home based’ where it was undertaken exclusively in the subject's home environment or, where exercise was partly supervised, the regimen was intended to be continued at home unsupervised. OutcomesPain and disability. Results 13 studies were included. One study provided a direct comparison between aerobic <b>walking</b> and <b>home</b> based strengthening exercises and control. Nine RCTs evaluated quadriceps strengthening exercises, and in three studies the exercise intervention was predominantly aerobic walking. Control interventions included education and lifestyle advice, support by telephone calls, and no intervention. When comparing aerobic walking with no exercise interventions, the pooled effect sizes for pain and disability were 0. 52 (95 % CI 0. 34 to 0. 70) and 0. 46 (95 % CI 0. 25 to 0. 67) respectively. Corresponding effect size for quadriceps strengthening was 0. 32 (95 % CI 0. 23 to 0. 42) for both pain and disability. ConclusionBoth aerobic <b>walking</b> and <b>home</b> based quadriceps strengthening exercises are effective at reducing pain and disability in subjects with knee osteoarthritis. No advantage of one form of exercise over the other was found on indirect comparison...|$|R
