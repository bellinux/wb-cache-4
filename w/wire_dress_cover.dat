Although the <b>dress</b> <b>covers</b> the entire body, {{it is thought}} to be provocative, especially when it is made of thin fabric. [...] "The ao dai covers everything, but hides nothing", according to one saying. The dress must be individually fitted and usually requires several weeks for a tailor to complete. An ao dai costs about $200 in the United States and about $40 in Vietnam.|$|R

Their women wear <b>dresses</b> <b>covered</b> in lace and frills, and their men wear loose shirts and vests or sleeveless jackets. Unlike the rough straps used by the northerners, the belts worn by the Gottlungs are long and thin, often nearly touching the ground, and they are adorned with intricate, modestly sized buckles. Their buckles are often adorned with the Eye of the Sleeper.|$|R
50|$|The risk of {{reducing}} this fracture includes {{the disruption of}} the blood supply to the bone. It {{has been shown in}} the past that attempts to correct the slippage by moving the head back into its correct position can cause the bone to die. Therefore the head of the femur is usually pinned 'as is'. A small incision is made in the outer side of the upper thigh and metal pins are placed through the femoral neck and into the head of the femur. A <b>dressing</b> <b>covers</b> the wound.|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} theoretically and experimentally that Fano resonances can {{be obtained}} in terahertz metamaterials that are composed of periodic continuous metallic <b>wires</b> <b>dressed</b> with periodic split ring resonators. An asymmetric Fano lineshape {{has been found in}} a narrow frequency range of the transmission curve. By using a transmission line combined with lumped element model, we are able to not only fit the transmission spectra of Fano resonance which is attributed to the coupling and interference between the transmission continuum of continuous metallic wires and the bright resonant mode of split ring resonators, but also reveal the capacitance change of the split ring resonators induced frequency shift of the Fano resonance. Therefore, the proposed theoretical model shows more capabilities than conventional coupled oscillator model in the design of Fano structures. The effective parameters of group refractive index of the Fano structure are retrieved, and a large group index more than 800 is obtained at the Fano resonance, which could be used for slow light devices.
