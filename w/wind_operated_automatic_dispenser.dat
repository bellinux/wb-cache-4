50|$|An <b>automatic</b> soap <b>dispenser</b> is {{specifically}} a hands-free dispenser of soap (both liquid soap and foaming soap), but generally {{can be used}} for other liquids such as hand sanitizers, shampoos, or hand lotions. <b>Automatic</b> <b>dispensers</b> are often battery-powered. The touch-free design dispenses the liquid when a sensor detects motion under the nozzle. The electronic components of an <b>automatic</b> soap <b>dispenser</b> allow for a timing device or signal (sound, lights, etc.) which can indicate to the user whether they have washed their hands for the correct amount of time or not.|$|R

40|$|Prototheca spp. are colorless {{unicellular}} algae {{ubiquitous in}} nature and opportunistic pathogens for humans and animals. Since Prototheca is an important cause of bovine mastitis, milk, as well as dairy products, can be contaminated and represent a potential mean of transmission of this microorganism to man. We carried out a survey on the <b>automatic</b> milk <b>dispensers</b> in the Emilia-Romagna Region (Northern Italy), to evaluate human exposure to Prototheca through raw milk. Milk samples were collected from 177 <b>automatic</b> <b>dispensers,</b> distributing milk from 117 dairy herds. Prototheca spp. was isolated on 17 milk samples (9, 6 %) produced by 14 dairy herds. The results of molecular characterization indicate that the isolates were P. zopfii genotipe 2 e P. blaschkeae, both species being associated whit human diseases. Our investigation points out the importance of raw milk as a carrier of microorganisms potentially harmful to humans...|$|R

50|$|Many modern washing {{machines}} have a dispenser that adds liquid fabric softener automatically {{on the final}} rinse. Users of launderette machines may need to add it manually. Some washing powder brands have fabric conditioning mixed in, which manufacturers claim saves money compared to buying separate washing powder and fabric softener. Some manufacturers claim their products make ironing easier or make clothes dry faster. All liquid fabric softeners are added to water—either by adding the product directly to the final rinse water or by 2:1 (water:softener) dilution in an <b>automatic</b> <b>dispenser.</b> Even diluted fabric softener can cause spotting when poured directly onto clothes, and can ruin them.|$|R

The aim of the present research is to evaluate both the biosecurity of dairy farms in the Pisa province and the hygienic quality of raw milk. Two farms, chosen because of previously analyzed results carried out on animals and milk, were monitored for 9 months according to the regional law DGR 381 / 2007. The results obtained showed that these farms presented good cattle health status. The raw milk tested was of a satisfactory hygienic quality, with great variability among milk samples in certain parameters, such as somatic cell count. This study confirmed the importance of consistent, ongoing control of safety conditions on dairy farms...|$|R
40|$|Patients {{and health}} staff {{frequently}} {{need to stay}} in health care facilities {{for quite a long}} time. Therefore, it's necessary to create the conditions that allow the ingestion of food during those periods, namely through the existence of <b>automatic</b> food <b>dispensers.</b> However, the available food and beverages might not always be compatible with a healthy diet. The aim of this work was to evaluate if the food and beverages available in <b>automatic</b> food <b>dispensers</b> in public Ambulatory Care Facilities (ACF) and Hospitals of the Portugal North Health Region were contributing to a healthy diet, during the year of 2007. A questionnaire was elaborated and sent to the Coordinators of the Health Sub-Regions and to the Hospital Administrators. The questionnaire requested information about the existence of <b>automatic</b> food <b>dispensers</b> in the several departments of each health care facility, as well as which food and beverages were available and most sold. Afterwards, the pre-processing of the results involved the classification of the food and beverages in three categories: recommended, sometimes recommended and not recommended. The questionnaire reply ratio was 71 % in ACF and 83 % in Hospitals. <b>Automatic</b> food <b>dispensers</b> were available in all the Hospitals and 86. 5 % of ACF. It wasn't possible to acquire food in 37 % of the health facility departments. These departments were all located in ACF. The more frequently available beverages in departments with <b>automatic</b> food <b>dispensers</b> were coffee, still water, tea, juices and nectars and soft drinks. Still water, coffee, yogurt, juices and nectars and soft drinks were reported as the most sold. The more frequently avaliable food items were chocolate, recommended cookies, not recommended cakes, recommended sandwiches and sometimes recommended croissants. The food items reported as being the most sold were recommended sandwiches, chocolate, recommended cookies, sometimes recommended croissants and not recommended cookies. The beverages in the recommended and sometimes recommended groups were the most frequently available and sold. The not recommended food items were reported as being the most available, while both the recommended and not recommended food items were equally reported as being the most sold. Results show that unhealthy food and beverages are widely available in public health care facilities of the Portugal North Health Region.

50|$|Regarding {{a single}} warehouse, besides {{the issue of}} {{designing}} and building the warehouse, configuration means solving a number of interrelated technical-economic problems: dimensioning rack cells, choosing a palletizing method (manual or through robots), rack dimensioning and design, number of racks, number and typology of retrieval systems (e.g. stacker cranes). Some important constraints have to be satisfied: fork and load beams resistance to bending and proper placement of sprinklers. Although picking {{is more of a}} tactical planning decision than a configuration problem, it is important to take it into account when deciding the racks layout inside the warehouse and buying tools such as handlers and motorized carts since once those decisions are taken they will work as constraints when managing the warehouse, same reasoning for sorting when designing the conveyor system or installing <b>automatic</b> <b>dispensers.</b>|$|R
