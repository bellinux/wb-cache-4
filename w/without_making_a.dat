5|$|Don Calò further {{established}} his fortune in 1922 {{when he led}} disgruntled peasants who grabbed land from the aristocratic absentee landlords. Vizzini bought three estates in the Villalba region; he divided them up and handed them over – allegedly <b>without</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> penny, according to some – to a cooperative he had founded. According to a local villager, although every peasant got a plot, Don Calò kept more than 12,000 acres (49km²) for himself.|$|E

5|$|When Franklin and Providence/Stoughton service {{returned}} to the main line, service on the Midland had become popular enough to justify a continued shuttle service along the line from Boston to Fairmount. The Fairmount Shuttle was extended to Readville on November 30, 1987 as the Fairmount Line. Since 1987, Providence/Stoughton Line service has run through Readville <b>without</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> station stop, {{even though there are}} platforms in place to allow such use.|$|E
5|$|His {{introduction}} to films was unusual. When visiting an aunt {{who lived in}} Brooklyn opposite Vitagraph Studios, Cagney would climb over the fence to watch the filming of John Bunny movies. He became involved in amateur dramatics, starting as a scenery boy for a Chinese pantomime at Lenox Hill Neighborhood House, {{one of the first}} settlement houses in the nation, where his brother Harry performed and his soon-to-be friend, Florence James, directed. He was initially content working behind the scenes and had no interest in performing. One night, however, Harry became ill, and although Cagney was not an understudy, his photographic memory of rehearsals enabled him to stand in for his brother <b>without</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> single mistake. Therefore, Florence James has the unique distinction of being the first director to put him on a stage. Afterward, he joined a number of companies as a performer in a variety of roles.|$|E
5|$|This season had 16 {{tropical}} depressions, 15 named storms, 9 hurricanes, and 6 major hurricanes, i.e. {{those that}} rank as Category3 or {{higher on the}} Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale.

This {{is the only time}} in recorded history that four hurricanes affected the U.S. State of Florida although one of the four, Ivan, brought hurricane force winds to the state <b>without</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> landfall there.|$|E

5|$|Charged {{with the}} crime of heresy, based on her claim of visions and signs from God, she is tried in an ecclesiastical court proceeding, which is forced by the English {{occupation}} government. The English wish to quickly condemn and execute Joan since English soldiers are afraid to fight while she remains alive, based on their belief that she could supernaturally affect battles even while in prison. Bishop Cauchon expresses his fear of wrongfully executing someone who might have received visions from God. About to be burned for heresy, Joan is distraught {{that she will be}} executed <b>without</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> final confession. The Bishop tells her she must recant her visions before he can hear her confession. Joan signs the recantation. The relieved Bishop shows the paper to the English, saying that Joan can no longer be burned as a heretic. Whilst in her cell, Joan is confronted by an unnamed cloaked man (Dustin Hoffman), who is implied to be Joan's conscience. The man makes Joan question whether she was actually receiving messages from God.|$|E
5|$|The {{first edition}} of this work, {{published}} in 1861, was received so favourably that the author has felt bound to bestow his utmost care upon a minute and thorough revision of his book, {{in the hope of}} bringing up the information it contains to the existing state of knowledge. In this endeavour he has been assisted as well by Canon Lightfoot, to whom he is indebted for that section of the third chapter which treats of Egyptian versions of the New Testament (pp. 319-357), as also by much unsought for and most welcome help, especially {{on the part of those}} scholars who are named in p. 164, note. Without wishing to speak harshly of writers who are not very scrupulous in such matters, he has always thought it became him to borrow from no quarter <b>without</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> full and frank avowal of the fact. The author will be much rejoiced if this new edition shall be judged not less worthy than its predecessor to become a text book in Universities and Theological Celleges.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason that}} cats {{are seen as}} yōkai in Japanese mythology is {{attributed}} {{to many of the}} characteristics that they possess: for example, the way the irises of their eyes change shape depending on the time of day, the way their fur seems to cause sparks due to static electricity when they are petted (especially in winter), the way they sometimes lick blood, the way they can walk <b>without</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> sound, their wild nature that remains despite the gentleness they can show at times, the way they are difficult to control (unlike dogs), the sharpness of their claws and teeth, their nocturnal habits, and their speed and agility.|$|E

We might as soon reconcile ourselves to the Spartan community of goods and wives, to their iron coin, their long beards, or their black broth. There is a total dissimulation in the circumstances, as well as the manners, of society among us; and it is as ridiculous to seek for models in the simple ages of Greece and Rome, as it would be to go in quest of them among the Hottentots and Laplanders.|$|E

25|$|Baynton was {{the younger}} brother of the actor-manager Henry Baynton; he trained at Birmingham University as a dentist. In {{first-class}} cricket, he was a right-handed lower-order batsman and a left-arm medium pace bowler. After a couple of matches in 1921 for Warwickshire, he played fairly regularly {{in the second half}} of the 1922 season as an amateur, <b>without</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> decisive impact on any match. His best batting came in the game against Lancashire when he made his best score of 36, batting at No 9, and was top scorer in the Warwickshire first innings. His best bowling was four wickets for 56 runs in the game against Nottinghamshire in the same season. He played only once in the 1923 season and not at all thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Boon {{was less}} {{conspicuous}} during {{a tour of}} Pakistan and the home Test against the West Indies, until he hit 149 in the fourth Test against the West Indies at Sydney. His ODI form also hit a slump, and he contributed only one major innings in the World Series Cup, 71 against the West Indies at Sydney. Australia lost both Test series and the World Series. However, the team finally found sustained success, beginning with the 1989 tour of England. Boon returned to the number three position when Mark Taylor was brought into the team to partner Geoff Marsh. Boon compiled 442 runs at 55.25, <b>without</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> century, as Australia regained the Ashes 4–0. His best score was 94 at Lord's.|$|E
25|$|The White Lady, <b>without</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> sound, {{advances}} {{along the}} terrace. Raymonda follows {{her in a}} state of unconsciousness. At a signal from the White Lady, the garden is wrapped in mist. A moment later, the mist vanishes and Jean de Brienne appears. Overjoyed, Raymonda runs into his arms and they are surrounded by glory, knights and celestial maidens. The garden is illuminated by a fantastic light and Raymonda expresses her joy to the White Lady, who interrupts her enthusiasm with a vision of what awaits her. Raymonda wants to return to her fiancé, but instead, she finds Abderakhman, who has taken Jean de Brienne's place. Abderakhman declares his passionate love for her, but Raymonda, though confused and upset, is quick to reject him. Imps and elves appear from everywhere surrounding Raymonda, who begs the White Lady to save her and Abderakhman tries to take Raymonda by force. Raymonda cries out and falls to the ground in a faint. The frightful vision disappears along with the White Lady.|$|E

25|$|Vernon Hill {{initially}} attended Rev. J Cornish's School at Clevedon {{where he}} was a contemporary of Lionel Palairet. He went to Winchester College in 1884, was in the second eleven in 1886 and the first eleven from 1887 to 1889. At Winchester he was mainly known as a bowler. In these years he made appearances for the College against Eton. He went up to Oriel College, Oxford, in 1889. He played four games for Somerset in their undefeated summer of 1890, aged just 19, helping them regain first-class status. In the following 1891 County Championship, he appeared in nine of the county's twelve matches, also playing one match for Oxford University against Oxfordshire. He played nine times in first-class university matches for Oxford in 1892, under the captaincy of his friend and Somerset teammate Lionel Palairet. It was while playing for Oxford in the Varsity match that Hill hit his first century, a 100-minute 114, adding 178 in a sixth wicket stand with Malcolm Jardine. Hill played for Somerset again through the summer, scoring 224 runs in his 13 innings for the county. In 1893, Hill played four more times for the University <b>without</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> notable impression on the scorecard.|$|E
25|$|On June 25, 2009, Hansbrough was {{selected}} by the Indiana Pacers with the 13th overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft. After missing all of training camp, the preseason and the first four games {{of the regular season}} with an injury to his shin, he made his NBA debut against the Washington Wizards on November 6, 2009. He tallied 13 points against Washington, including 7-of-10 from the foul line. At the time, he was just the second Indiana player to have attempted 10 or more free throws in a game. After averaging 3.8 rebounds per game in his first 14 appearances, he led the Pacers with 11 rebounds against the Portland Trail Blazers on December 9. In that game, he gathered a season-high seven offensive rebounds, tying Roy Hibbert for second most by any Indiana player in 2009–10. On December 11, he scored a season-high 21 points against the New Jersey Nets. On December 27, he made and attempted 10 free throws against the Miami Heat, becoming the first player in Pacers' history to record a double-double (10 points, 10 rebounds) <b>without</b> <b>making</b> <b>a</b> field goal. His final game of the season came on January 16, 2010, as he sat out 49 of the season's final 53 games with an inner ear infection.|$|E
