5|$|For {{two centuries}} after George II's death, history tended to view him <b>with</b> <b>disdain,</b> concentrating on his mistresses, short temper and boorishness. Since then, most {{scholars}} have reassessed his legacy and conclude {{that he held}} and exercised influence in foreign policy and military appointments.|$|E
5|$|For {{the last}} nine months I have kept silence and treated <b>with</b> <b>disdain</b> the charges of disloyalty and {{suggestions}} of treachery made against me in the Press and elsewhere. But I can keep silence no longer, for these charges and suggestion have now been repeated by public men who have not scrupled to use their position to inflame the overstrained feelings of the people.|$|E
5|$|From the start, Habré {{isolated}} {{himself from}} {{the other members of}} the GUNT, which he treated <b>with</b> <b>disdain.</b> Habré's hostility for Libya's influence in Chad united itself with his ambition and ruthlessness: observers concluded that the warlord would never be content with anything short of the highest office. It was thought that sooner or later an armed confrontation between Habré and the pro-Libyan factions would take place, and more importantly, between Habré and Goukouni.|$|E

5|$|Opposition to the King and his {{marriage}} came from several directions. Edward's desire to modernise the monarchy {{and make it}} more accessible, though appreciated by many of the public, was distrusted by the British Establishment. Edward upset the aristocracy by treating their traditions and ceremonies <b>with</b> <b>disdain,</b> and many were offended by his abandonment of accepted social norms and mores.|$|E
5|$|Relations {{between the}} United Kingdom and the United States were {{strained}} during the inter-war {{years and the}} majority of Britons were reluctant to accept an American as queen consort. At the time, some members of the British upper class looked down on Americans <b>with</b> <b>disdain</b> and considered them socially inferior. In contrast, the American public was clearly in favour of the marriage, as was most of the American press.|$|E
5|$|Morrowind also {{contained}} a fair bit of voiced dialogue; an aspect somewhat better {{received by the}} gaming press. Of note is Lynda Carter, television's Wonder Woman, promoted by Bethesda {{for her role in}} voicing the female Nords in the game. Morrowinds race-specific voice acting received praise from some reviewers, though was met <b>with</b> <b>disdain</b> from others, who disliked the discord between a culturally inflected voice spoken in an alien dialect and the grammatically flawless dialogue printed in the dialogue boxes. The Special Edition Soundtrack was released over DirectSong as a digital release.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, Boisselier {{converted}} to Raëlism, a UFO religion {{founded by the}} French journalist Claude Vorilhon, usually known as Raël, in 1973. After attending a meeting at which Raël spoke, she felt strongly that he was completely honest and joined his movement. She had left her husband, alleging violent behavior, shortly before her conversion; afterwards, owing to her involvement with Raëlism, he gained sole custody of their youngest child. Boisselier believed that religious intolerance motivated a court to transfer the child's custody. Although her faith led to tension with her parents, her eldest child converted. In the 1990s, Raëlism was seen as dangerous and viewed <b>with</b> <b>disdain</b> in France, resulting in loss of employment for prominent members. The hostility was fueled in part by public concerns about new religious movements after deaths caused by the Order of the Solar Temple in Europe during the mid-1990s.|$|E
5|$|Karmal's {{three most}} {{important}} promises were the general amnesty of prisoners, the promulgation of the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and {{the adoption of a}} new flag containing the traditional black, red and green (the flag of Taraki and Amin was red). His government granted concessions to religious leaders and the restoration of confiscated property. Some property, which was confiscated during earlier land reforms, was also partially restored. All these measures, {{with the exception of the}} general amnesty of prisoners, were introduced gradually. Of 2,700 prisoners, 2,600 were released from prison; 600 of these were Parchamites. The general amnesty was greatly publicized by the government. While the event was hailed with enthusiasm by some, many others greeted the event <b>with</b> <b>disdain,</b> since their loved ones or associates had died during earlier purges. Amin had planned to introduce a general amnesty on 1 January 1980, to coincide with the PDPA's sixteenth anniversary.|$|E
5|$|Pressured by the United Nations, {{which had}} looked at the {{situation}} in the former East Indies <b>with</b> <b>disdain,</b> on 29August 1947 the Dutch established the Van Mook Line, which divided Dutch and Indonesian-controlled areas. Along this line a ceasefire was called. Sudirman recalled the Indonesian guerrillas hiding in Dutch-held lands, ordering them to return to Indonesian-held areas. To keep their spirits up, he referred to the withdrawal as a hijrah, reminiscent of Muhammad's migration to Medina in 622AD, implying that they would return. Over 35,000troops left western Java at this order, travelling to Yogyakarta by train and ship. This boundary was formalised by the Renville Agreement on 17January 1948; among the signatories was Amir Sjarifuddin, by then also serving as prime minister. Meanwhile, Sjarifuddin began rationalising the army, cutting back on the number of troops. At the time the regular army consisted of 350,000men, with a further 470,000in the laskar.|$|E

5|$|Robinson married Marjorie Joseph in 1938; the {{marriage}} was annulled the same year. Their son, Ronnie Smith, was born in 1939. Robinson met his second wife Edna Mae Holly, a noted dancer who performed at the Cotton Club and toured Europe with Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway, in 1940. According to Robinson, he met her at a local pool he frequented after his boxing workouts. In {{an attempt to get}} her attention he pushed her into the pool one day, and claimed it was an accident. After this attempt was met <b>with</b> <b>disdain,</b> he appeared at the nightclub she danced at and introduced himself. Soon the couple were dating and they married in 1943. They had one son, Ray Robinson Jr. (born 1949) and divorced in 1960. She appeared on the first cover of Jet magazine in 1951. In April 1959 Robinson's eldest sister, Marie, died of cancer at the age of 41.|$|E
5|$|As the Griffin family {{prepare to}} sit down for their dinner, baby Stewie is shown {{watching}} television, with the annual Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade taking place on the screen. Stewie notices a hot air balloon in the parade resembling himself. After the family decides {{to go to the}} Griffin family's backyard to play football, Joe approaches his son to encourage him to beat the other team. Joe then references the 2009 war film The Hurt Locker, with Kevin responding <b>with</b> <b>disdain</b> for the film, despite supposedly being in a coma during its release. Joe also goes on to point out that Kevin is wearing an Ed Hardy t-shirt, which also became popularized during his supposed coma, and despite Kevin telling his father that he flew straight home after he awoke. Later during dinner, when Kevin reveals that he went A.W.O.L., Peter makes an off the wall reference, causing the episode to cut to a room showing several of the show's editors, who become confused about what cutaway to play on the screen. They then decide to play a clip involving several characters from The Wizard of Oz, including the Cowardly Lion, who is shown to be actress Lindsay Lohan's gynecologist.|$|E

25|$|Their Christian and Muslim neighbors once {{looked upon}} the Abayudaya <b>with</b> <b>disdain</b> and hatred, but {{relations}} have improved significantly and some view {{members of the}} Abayudaya with respect and admiration. It {{should also be noted}} that the community has been growing at a steady rate. Numbering only 300 individuals at the time of the fall of Idi Amin, the Abayudaya have grown to as many as 2,000 individuals since that time.|$|E
25|$|The {{electoral reforms}} of the bull were not {{received}} well in all quarters. The precedent that only cardinal-bishops could vote in elections was met <b>with</b> <b>disdain</b> by the minor Roman clergy. The cardinal-bishops, because of their offices, were “distinctly non-Roman,” thus removing the control held by the Roman metropolitan church over {{the election of the}} pontiff.The bull was also a set back for the cardinal-priests and cardinal-deacons, from whom, in theory, the next pope had to be chosen from before the bull was issued.|$|E
25|$|The Thai {{response}} to the insurgency has been hampered by clumsy methods, a lack of training in counter-insurgency, {{a lack of understanding}} of local culture, and rivalries between the police and the army. Many local policemen are allegedly involved in the local drug trade and other criminal activities, and army commanders from Bangkok treat them <b>with</b> <b>disdain.</b> Often the army responds to the attacks with heavy-handed raids to search Muslim villages, which only results in reprisals. Insurgents routinely provoke the inexperienced Thai government into disproportionate responses, generating sympathy among the Muslim populace.|$|E

25|$|After {{moving in}} with Perón, Eva is {{introduced}} to high society, but she is met <b>with</b> <b>disdain</b> from the upper classes and the Argentine Army ("Perón's Latest Flame"). In 1946, Perón launches his presidential bid after being promoted to general in the army, and while in bed with Eva, he discusses his chances of winning the election. Eva reassures him and soon they organise rallies where the people show their support and hope for a better future, while on the sidelines Perón and his allies plot to dispose of anyone who stands in their way ("A New Argentina").|$|E
25|$|For all its success, the Balloon Corps {{was never}} fully {{appreciated}} {{by the military}} community. They were still regarded as carnival showmen. Others had little respect for their break-neck operation. The only ones who found any value in them were the generals whose jobs and reputations were on the line. Lower-ranking administrators looked <b>with</b> <b>disdain</b> on this band of civilians who, as they perceived them, had {{no place in the}} military. Furthermore, none of the corps ever received a military commission, leaving them facing the dangers of being captured and treated as spies, summarily punishable by death.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Osmani {{chaired the}} {{committee}} tasked with determining future army-reserve and logistical requirements and {{was president of}} the Army Sports Control Board from July 1965 to April 1966. On 16 May 1966, he went on leave prior to retirement (LPR). Osmani's successor as DDMO was Rao Farman Ali, who played a controversial role in the 1971 Bangladesh War. Ali was reportedly horrified at Osmani's treatment by the army; his office was run-down, Osmani was kept out of the loop and office employees treated him <b>with</b> <b>disdain.</b> According to Ali, Osmani was not promoted because he was Bengali and deemed untrustworthy by the high command.|$|E
