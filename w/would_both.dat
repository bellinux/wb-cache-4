5|$|Among insects, {{so-called}} killer bees were accidentally {{created during}} {{an attempt to}} breed a strain of bees that <b>would</b> <b>both</b> produce more honey and be better adapted to tropical conditions. It was done by crossing a European honey bee and an African bee.|$|E
5|$|Fransen {{failed to}} explain to the Bradleys that he was not the owner of the concept, and Chamberlin was unhappy with the fact that someone {{overseas}} was copying his idea. After some acrimony between the two parties, a deal was struck between them in 1966, whereby they <b>would</b> <b>both</b> continue to manufacture instruments independently. Bradmatic renamed themselves Streetly Electronics in 1970.|$|E
5|$|Mayo and Piepoli <b>would</b> <b>both</b> test {{positive}} for erythropoietin later {{in their careers}} at the Tour de France, and Di Luca likewise at the 2009 Giro d'Italia, all leading to lengthy suspensions, while Petacchi made a successful return to top-level cycling and to the Giro in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Since Betances' exile {{depended}} on who was governing Puerto Rico at the time, {{a change in}} government allowed {{him to return to}} Mayagüez in 1862. However, a few years later, (1868) Luperón and Betances <b>would</b> <b>both</b> end up exiled in Saint Thomas.|$|E
5|$|Benjamin Disraeli adopted one-nation {{conservatism}} {{for both}} ethical and electoral reasons. Before he became {{leader of the}} Conservative Party, Disraeli had announced that, {{as a result of}} the Reform Act 1867 which had enfranchised the male working-class, the party needed to pursue social reforms if it were to have electoral success. One-nationism <b>would</b> <b>both</b> improve the conditions of the poor and portray the Liberal Party as selfish individualists. Because the party portrayed itself as a national (and not class-based) party, it's members were unsure whether to make specific appeals to the working-classes. A more positive approach to the working-class by the party developed later out of the electoral necessity to secure working-class votes.|$|E

5|$|During his pontificate Clement strove diplomatically {{to bring}} Western European nations to defense of Crete. The Ottomans were {{planning}} to advance on the Venetian owned capital of the Island at Candia. He intervened in the War of Devolution and helped negotiate a peace, which increased the likelihood that Spain and France <b>would</b> <b>both</b> aid Crete. The French initially sent a small force to aid Crete in 1668, before increasing their troop commitment in 1669. This did affect {{the outcome of the}} Ottoman advance, and they captured Candia in September 1669.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to Rome in December, and {{was present in}} March 20 when Agrippina arrived with Germanicus' ashes. He was also present for the trial of Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso, who was posthumously found guilty for the crime of maiestas (treason). On 16 December, his father gave a eulogy for Germanicus during a Senate meeting, and he gave a eulogy the next meeting. It was decided that their eulogies <b>would</b> <b>both</b> be inscribed in bronze: that of Tiberius for future generations, but the libellus (eulogy) of Drusus to demonstrate the devotion of Drusus for his adoptive brother {{in a show of}} pietas (piety).|$|E
5|$|In 1968, {{after the}} Rockets won a coin toss against the Baltimore Bullets to {{determine}} who would have the first overall pick in the 1968 NBA Draft, they selected Elvin Hayes from the University of Houston.

Pittsburgh won the {{division}} with a franchise record 119 points in the regular season, including an NHL-record 17-game winning streak. However, the third-place team in the division, the New York Islanders, <b>would</b> upset <b>both</b> Washington and Pittsburgh in the division semifinals and finals, respectively, thus preventing a third consecutive Caps-Pens playoff matchup.|$|R
5|$|In December 1966, the Army asked Bell {{to prepare}} a {{detailed}} deployment concept combining the light defense of Nth Country with the point defense of Hardsite. On 17 January 1967, this became the I-67 project, which delivered its results on 5 July. I-67 was essentially Nth Country but with more bases near Minuteman fields, armed primarily with Sprint. The wide-area Zeus and short-range Sprint bases <b>would</b> <b>both</b> be supported by the PAR network.|$|E
5|$|In early 1922 Marquis started {{considering}} {{working as}} an Indian agency physician.

In June, Marquis was appointed agency physician to the Northern Cheyenne. He arrived in the agency village of Lame Deer, Montana, in early July.|$|E

Flourishing a commission from the Massachusetts Committee of Safety, he asserted his right to command the expedition. The assembled men refused to acknowledge his authority, insisting they would only follow Allen's lead. In a private discussion, Allen and Arnold reached an accommodation, the essence of which was that Arnold and Allen <b>would</b> <b>both</b> be {{at the front of}} the troops when the attack on the fort was made.|$|E

When Max split up with Steph, she was heartbroken. After a talk they decided they <b>would</b> <b>both</b> give it another go, and Steph asked him to meet her for lunch. Niall made sure Max thought that he and Steph had an affair. This resulted in Max and Steph splitting up once more. They reconciled, but the doubts continued. When Steph was at The Loft with Niall and Nancy, she saw Max with another girl and {{decided to make a}} move of her own — grabbing Niall and kissing him passionately.|$|E
5|$|The Centre's main feature, {{the bronze}} {{coloured}} dome which covers the Donald Gordon Theatre, is clad in steel that {{was treated with}} copper oxide.

5|$|The Jackson-Rowe {{friendship}} {{would last}} for several years, {{during which time}} Rowe married and divorced Richard Edelman, a man she claimed to have felt trapped by. Rowe and the musician <b>would</b> <b>both</b> {{talk to each other}} about their unhappy marriages; his with Presley and hers with Edelman, a teacher at Hollywood High School. Like Jackson's first wife, Rowe supported the entertainer when he was accused of child sexual abuse. Jackson kept his friendship with Rowe a secret from his wife, who eventually found out but thought nothing of it; she felt the dermatologist's assistant was not her husband's type because she was not glamorous enough.|$|E
5|$|The {{match was}} Liverpool 13th {{appearance}} in the final. They had won on six occasions (1965, 1974, 1986, 1989, 1992, 2001) and lost six times (1914, 1950, 1971, 1977, 1988, 1996).

The episode included the first appearances of guest actors Andre Royo and Amy Madigan, who <b>would</b> <b>both</b> appear in several later episodes. It first aired in the United States on Fox in September 23, 2010, receiving almost all positive reviews due to the combination of emotional storylines, suspense, action, and humor. Many {{thought it was a}} good indicator of what the rest of the season had to offer, while others appreciated the numerous popular culture references that set the two universes apart.|$|E
