5|$|Among the ECSC's {{greatest}} achievements {{are those}} on welfare issues. Some mines, for example, were clearly unsustainable without government subsidies. Some miners had extremely poor housing. Over 15 years it financed 112,500 flats for workers, paying US$1,770 per flat, enabling workers {{to buy a}} home they could not have otherwise afforded. The ECSC also paid half the occupational redeployment costs of those <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> lost their jobs as coal and steel facilities began to close down. Combined with regional redevelopment aid the ECSC spent $150million creating 100,000 jobs, a third of which were for unemployed coal and steel workers. The welfare guarantees invented by the ECSC were extended to workers outside the coal and steel sector by some of its members.|$|E
5|$|The Crown Roller Mills {{building}} {{is not in}} Princes Street itself, but rather lies {{at the foot of}} Manor Place, close to its intersection with Princes Street. It stands {{at the edge of a}} small area of parkland called the Market Reserve, at the opposite edge of which is the city's main bus depot. This area was swampland when the first European settlers arrived in Dunedin, but was reclaimed and did host a regular market for a few years from the 1870s. The market was not well-supported, however, and eventually folded. The bus depot is located on the site of the city's 1902 Tram workshops. The Market Reserve also contains a children's playground and, at the edge closes to the Crown Roller Mills Building, a small monument dedicated to Otago <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> lost their lives while at work. This simple bluestone memorial was erected in 2003 by the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions on a site donated by the Dunedin City Council.|$|E
25|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} glyphosate-resistant sugar beet has decreased {{the demand for}} migrant <b>workers,</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> historically been employed as seasonal workers to pull weeds on conventional sugar beet farms in the United States. The glyphosate sprayed on GM beet fields significantly reduces weed growth.|$|E

25|$|Runaway migrant {{domestic}} {{workers are}} former-live in <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> left their sponsor {{for a variety}} of reasons. As soon as the migrant domestic worker laves their place of residence they are automatically seen as an illegal alien. The migrant domestic worker must then either return to their home country or find a new sponsor.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{homeless}} people worldwide has grown steadily in recent years. In some developing countries such as Nigeria, and South Africa, homelessness is rampant, with millions of children living and working on the streets. Homelessness has become {{a problem in the}} countries of China, India, Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines despite their growing prosperity, mainly due to migrant <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> trouble finding permanent homes.|$|E

25|$|Overall, these {{agreements}} serve two main purposes. First, they eliminate dual Social Security taxation, {{the situation that}} occurs when a worker from one country works in another country and is required to pay Social Security taxes to both countries on the same earnings. Second, the agreements help fill gaps in benefit protection for <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> divided their careers between the United States and another country.|$|E
25|$|A {{report from}} a {{parliamentary}} {{working group on}} nuclear safety noticed that, even though Brazil signed and ratified the International Labour Organization (ILO) Radiation Protection Convention (No. 115), it has not provided national measures that implement Article 12, which obliges signatories to commit medical services to former <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> {{been in contact with}} radioactive substances. Discussions to implement Article 12 have been ongoing in Brazil’s federal legislative body since 2006.|$|E
25|$|Turkey has a {{moderate}} level of female unemployment {{relative to other}} Muslim countries. In 2008, 11.6% of women were unemployed. By 2010, this number crept up to 13.0%. However, long-term employment is {{a significant portion of}} female unemployment. In 2010, according to World Bank statistics, 37% of all unemployed women were long-run unemployed workers, or <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been out of work for more than one year. Very little data exists on the long-term unemployment rates of women for most nations and for Middle Eastern nations in particular.|$|E

25|$|Recent {{reports on}} waste collection, note {{that being a}} garbage {{collector}} {{may be one of}} the most dangerous jobs in Iraq. Most of the 500 municipal <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been killed in Baghdad since 2005 have been waste collectors. There are inadequate waste collection vehicles with only 380 presently in service. Before the invasion there were 1200 working trucks. Most of the vehicles were destroyed or lost in the looting that seized the capital after the American invasion. The deputy mayor of Baghdad estimates the city needs 1,500 waste collection vehicles.|$|E
25|$|The Act defines unfair labor {{practices}} for both employers and labor unions. Section 1154 (d) of the Act bans strikes (including recognition strikes) by <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not selected an organization as their labor representative through the procedures {{outlined by the}} Act, but protects secondary picketing and publicity only if the labor union is the certified bargaining representative or has not lost an election at the worksite in the past 12 months and only if the publicity or picketing does not induce others to engage in strikes. Section 1154.5 explicitly bans hot cargo agreements. The Act also requires bargaining in good faith.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s, a {{relatively}} high prevalence of pediatric leukemia cases in children living near a nuclear processing plant in West Cumbria, UK, led researchers to investigate whether the cancer {{was a result of}} paternal radiation exposure. A significant association between paternal irradiation and offspring cancer was found, but further research areas close to other nuclear processing plants did not produce the same results. Later this was determined to be the Seascale cluster in which the leading hypothesis is the influx of foreign <b>workers,</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> a different rate of leukemia within their race than the British average, resulted in the observed cluster of 6 children more than expected around Cumbria.|$|E
25|$|The {{church is}} {{controlled}} by {{a small group of}} senior male overseers with each having oversight of a specific geographic region. Under each senior overseer are male head <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> oversight of a single state, province or similar area, depending on the country. These head workers handle the two-by-two pairing and field assignments of workers for that area. Each pair of workers has charge over several local meetings with the senior worker of the two having authority over his junior. Local meetings are hosted in the homes of elders who report to the workers. Correspondence such as reporting, finances, and instructions are often communicated according to the set hierarchy. The administration of the church and its annual process of assigning of workers to fields are rarely discussed among the membership.|$|E
25|$|Border Memorial: Frontera de los Muertos is an {{augmented}} reality public art project and memorial, {{dedicated to the}} thousands of migrant <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> died along the U.S./Mexico border in recent years trying to cross the desert southwest in search of work and a better life. Built for smartphone mobile devices, this project allows people to visualize the scope of the loss of life by marking each location where human remains have been recovered with a virtual object or augmentation. The public can simply download and launch a mobile application and aim their devices’ cameras at the landscape along the border and the surrounding desert. The application uses geolocation software to superimpose individual augments at the precise GPS coordinates of each recorded death, enabling the public to see the objects integrated into the physical location as if they existed in the real world.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, as {{a result}} of social workers' {{training}} in counseling and their experience in helping their clients with accessing benefits such as unemployment insurance and disability benefits, they are particularly well-suited to help individuals and families learn how to become financially self-sufficient. That said, {{there is a need for}} additional training vis a vis social workers in the financial household management arena. Under some conditions, a raise may trigger reductions in several benefits; therefore, it would be beneficial for social workers to study a financial education curriculum tailored for social workers such as financial social work to fully understand and explain the possible ramifications to clients. In addition, social workers often work with low-income or low to middle-income people who are either unbanked (do not have a banking account) or underbanked (individuals who have a bank account but tend to rely on high cost non-bank providers for their financial transactions). Social <b>workers</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> an understanding of financial institutions would be able to guide individuals and families to use mainstream financial institutions and thereby hold onto more of their income and spend less on high cost non-bank financial services.|$|E
