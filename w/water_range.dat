25|$|In early 1962, Eglin was {{considered}} {{as one of the}} possible launch sites for the Little Joe II ballistics test for the Apollo program, although the U.S. Army's White Sands Missile Range was eventually selected in late spring due, in part, to the simplified recovery on a land versus a <b>water</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The {{success of}} the Royal Air Force using Barnes Wallace's {{bouncing}} bombs in the dam busting missions of Operation Chastise on 16–17 May 1943, led the USAAF to investigate using similar tactics. After initial testing with a modified A-26 in January 1945 which was adapted at the Vickers experimental facility at Foxwarren, near Esher, Surrey, to drop the RAF spherical 35-in [...] Highball casing, with [...] of , twenty-five Speedee bomb casings (the American nomenclature for the Highball) {{were sent to the}} U.S. [...] On 28 April 1945, A-26C-25-DT Invader, [...] 43-22644, assigned to the 611 Base Unit at Wright Field, Ohio, departed Eglin for a low-level test drop on <b>Water</b> <b>Range</b> No. 60 in the Choctawhatchee Bay S of Lake Lorraine. Dropped at low altitude (~10 feet), the weapon skipped back into the aircraft, completely knocking off the tail unit causing the bomber to nose over instantly and crash into the bay [...] NE of Fort Walton, Florida. Following this accident, the Army Air Force dropped its interest into this attack method.|$|E

2500|$|The first GAM-77 Hound Dog missile {{assigned}} to the Strategic Air Command was carried aloft {{for the first time}} on 29 January 1960, aboard a B-52G-75-BW Stratofortress, 57-6472, c/n 464177, of 4135th Strategic Wing, commanded by Capt. Jay L. McDonald. The strategic missile was carried on the port underwing pylon during the flight that lasted more than four hours. The Eglin crew made the first Air Force launch of the type at 1950 hrs., over the Atlantic Missile Range, all previous launches having been made by contractor crews flying B-52s. A second Hound Dog was launched several hours later. On board the B-52 during the two launches was Gen. A. J. Russell, Commander of the 822d Air Division with headquarters at Turner Air Force Base, Georgia. Directing the mission from the Missile Control Center at Cape Canaveral was Lt. Col. William T. Wilborn, Test and Evaluation Director for the SAC Project Office at Eglin. [...] Another operational test of the GAM-77 Hound Dog took place over the Eglin <b>water</b> <b>range</b> on 31 March 1960 when a B-52G of the 4135th Strategic Wing, commanded by Capt. Jay L. McDonald, launched the missile from a point near Tampa, Florida, at 1347 hrs. CST, which then flew several hundred miles NW to hit a target in the Gulf of Mexico off the northwest Florida coast. This test followed a series of successful flights over the Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral as well as on the test ranges of Eglin.|$|E
50|$|The Non-limiting <b>water</b> <b>range</b> (NLWR) {{represents}} {{the range of}} water content in the soil where limitations to plant growth (such as water potential, air-filled porosity, or soil strength) are minimal. John Letey (1985) from UC Riverside introduced the NLWR concept {{in an attempt to}} integrate several physical properties associated with plant or root growth to refine the concept of available water capacity. Alvaro Pires da Silva, Bev Kay. and Ed Perfect (University of Guelph, Ontario) (1994) refined the concept and termed it least limiting <b>water</b> <b>range</b> (LLWR).|$|E

50|$|Because of {{the limited}} coal and <b>water</b> <b>range</b> of the {{existing}} fleet of Natal Government Railways (NGR) tank locomotives {{as well as the}} necessity to double- and even triple-head over the worst sections of the mainline, NGR Locomotive Superintendent D.A.

50|$|During trials, a saving {{of between}} 88% and 93% on water {{as well as}} a lower coal {{consumption}} were attained, the latter brought about by the higher temperature of the feedwater condensate.

50|$|Silver Spring {{products}} were commonplace throughout Kent, and many (including its 'Perfectly Clear' flavoured <b>water</b> <b>range)</b> were distributed nationwide.
