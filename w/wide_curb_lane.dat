40|$|Planning {{and policy}} efforts {{at all levels}} of {{transportation}} planning aim to increase levels of bicycling. An initial step in doing so is to ensure that a variety of facilities exist for bicycling, such as relatively <b>wide</b> <b>curb</b> <b>lanes,</b> on-street bike paths, or off-street bike paths. But bicycle facilities cost money, their merits are often called into question, and many consider spending on them a luxury. Planners and other transportation specialists often find themselves justifying that these facilities benefit the common good and that they induce increased use. Especially in austere economic times, they are often grasping for ways to “economize ” such facilities. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to review and interpret existing literature that evaluates the economic benefits of bicycle facilities and suggest strategies for evaluating economic benefits in future work. We first provide an overview of central issues and, in a consistent framework, identify factors that confound the manner in which bicycle benefits are estimated. We then briefly describe 25 studies that speak to economic dimensions of bicycle facilities. The third section interprets the existing literature by describing six core benefits of municipal and regional bicycle facilities. These benefits include direct benefits to the user (mobility, health, safety) and indirect benefits to society (decreased externalities, livability, fiscal). We conclude by proposing how this framework could be built on and challenges that lie ahead...|$|R
40|$|Today automobile-related {{problems}} of congestion, air pollution, and aesthetic pollution are an ever-increasing concern for {{urban and suburban}} areas. In this thesis the researcher examines the bicycle as a viable alternative transportation mode. Research examines levels of bicycle transportation {{around the world and}} in the United States. A brief historical analysis of bicycle transportation in the United States revealed that bicycling was an important mode of transportation in the late 1800 s. Bicycles regained popularity in the 1970 s, and many cities began to develop plans in order to handle the sudden increase in bicycling. Case studies of both foreign and domestic cities indicate some of the central aspects of bicycle planning. Different bicycle planning approaches, as well as planning benefits, are discussed. In particular, the advantages of the bicycle integration approach are stressed. The bicycle integration approach is the basis for a case study analysis of Bowling Green, Kentucky. The purpose of the analysis was to assess the local transportation infrastructure for its bicycle suitability by applying the bicycle stress level model. In addition, an inventory of the hazards and deficiencies of the transportation infrastructure was incorporated into the analysis of bicycle suitability. I concluded that the overall infrastructure in Bowling Green, Kentucky, is currently not suitable for bicycle transportation. Included in the results is a discussion of specific problem areas and maps showing the bicycle suitability of individual street segments. Recommendations are made to increase the bicycle friendliness of Bowling Green, including the overall recommendation for <b>wide</b> <b>curb</b> <b>lanes</b> and paved shoulders. In addition, many specific recommendations for the mitigation of hazards and the correction of infrastructure deficiencies are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Encouraging {{active and}} {{sustainable}} modes of transport {{has been an}} important goal for all transport authorities in developed countries. In many cities, cycling as an active transport mode is only directly investigated within the limited scope of separate road development projects. Efficient moves towards urban transport networks that favour sustainable modes can only be possible by accurate, realistic, and robust evaluation techniques to measure existing facilities, and to assess future network development scenarios. As a result, {{there is a need for}} tools and techniques to generate a comprehensive network perspective with regards to cycling facilities. This paper aims to introduce a method to evaluate bike accessibility between given origins and destinations. Considering an urban trip all the way from an origin (O) to a destination (D), the proposed evaluation method is capable of incorporating the key concerns of cyclists by applying route choice coefficients of a cycling trip into a path generation process. Moreover, the proposed method takes into account multiple route options available to ride between an origin-destination (OD) pair. The method is applied to the network of Brisbane, Australia. The network includes all levels of road hierarchy suitable for bikes (arterials, collectors, and access roads) and covers the effect of available bike facilities on road (bike paths, bike <b>lanes,</b> <b>wide</b> <b>curb</b> side <b>lanes,</b> and general traffic lanes). Indicative results are provided on bike accessibility to the Central Business District (CBD) from the suburbs...|$|R

40|$|Microscopic models {{provide an}} {{understanding}} of traffic operations {{at the level of}} passage of individual vehicles. Roadway performance can be ascertained by understanding how vehicles interact with each other. Cowan's M 3 headway distribution models were calibrated for the <b>curb</b> and median <b>lanes</b> of two-lane mainline freeway segments, using data captured at 14 sites. Calibration of the relationship among Cowamn's M 3 parameters, proportion of headways greater than a minimum of 1 sec, and flow rate yielded exponential decay equations for each lane. The M 3 models provide a source of vehicle arrivals for gap acceptance models, which may be used to quantify the ability of drivers to change lanes, for example. It was found that the parameters calibrated for each lane are suitable for use at any mainline site, independent of site-specific conditions. The proportion of small headways was found to be higher in the median <b>lane</b> than the <b>curb,</b> for all flow rates, and for both lanes lower than their respective equivalents on arterial roads with intersections. The largest bunched headway was considered to be between 2 and 3 sec. The models predicted bunching between 85 and 93 percent of median lane vehicles, and between 75 and 90 percent of <b>curb</b> <b>lane</b> vehicles, at capacity. The lesser amount of <b>curb</b> <b>lane</b> bunching reflects its use as a slower vehicle lane with greater stream friction...|$|R

40|$|Although {{curbside}} {{bus stops}} facilitate the boarding and alighting of buses, they create temporary bottlenecks by reducing vehicular speed and roadway capacity. Further, they cause substantial delays to other vehicles and {{force them to}} change lanes. This problem is more severe in developing countries like India, where bus drivers often face difficulties in stopping buses closer to their designated bus stops. The reasons for improper stopping include passengers waiting for the bus on the roadway instead of using the bus stop platform, arrival of multiple buses at the same time, standing vehicles on the <b>curb</b> <b>lane</b> (especially auto-rickshaws), etc. In this study, the effect of untidy stopping of buses on forced lane changes and traffic stream speed is evaluated by analysing traffic video data on two urban arterial sections in New Delhi. Both the sections have bus stopping areas marked and no on-street parking is allowed on the <b>curb</b> <b>lane.</b> A parameter called effective stopped position of buses (Estop) is introduced in this study, which can be determined from the lateral position and dwell time of the buses. Forced lane changes and traffic stream speed {{are found to be}} linearly related to the sum of dwell times of all buses at different Estop values in a count period of 5 minutes. It is further observed that forced lane changes increase and traffic stream speed decreases quite drastically when improper stopping of buses is severe...|$|R

40|$|Transportation {{planning}} in the US has traditionally focused on automotive traffic but is increasingly turning towards a multi-modal approach {{in order to}} accommodate all users. This shift in focus is particularly crucial for cyclists, as 630 were killed and 51 thousand injured on America’s roadways in 2009 alone.
