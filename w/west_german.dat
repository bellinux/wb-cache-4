5|$|A {{number of}} <b>West</b> <b>German</b> state organisations were {{responsible}} for policing {{the western side of}} the border. These included the Bundesgrenzschutz (BGS, Federal Border Protection), the Bayerische Grenzpolizei (Bavarian Border Police) and the Bundeszollverwaltung (Federal Customs Administration). <b>West</b> <b>German</b> Army units were not allowed to approach the border without being accompanied by BGS personnel.|$|E
5|$|From the outset, West Germany and the Allies {{rejected}} East Germany's legitimacy. The {{creation of}} East Germany was deemed a communist/Soviet fait accompli, without a freely or fairly elected government. West Germany regarded German citizenship and rights as applying equally to East and <b>West</b> <b>German</b> citizens. An East German who escaped or was {{released to the}} West was automatically granted <b>West</b> <b>German</b> rights including residence, the right to work, and EEC freedom of movement; <b>West</b> <b>German</b> laws were deemed to be applicable in the East. East Germans thus had a powerful incentive {{to move to the}} West, where they would enjoy greater freedom and economic prospects.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, {{historian}} Joseph Wulf {{proposed that}} the Wannsee House should {{be made into a}} Holocaust memorial and document centre, but the <b>West</b> <b>German</b> government was not interested at that time. The building was in use as a school, and funding was not available. Despondent at the failure of the project and the <b>West</b> <b>German</b> government's failure to pursue and convict Nazi war criminals, Wulf committed suicide in 1974.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the coming}} years, several organisations, {{including}} the CIA and the <b>West</b> <b>German</b> Government, attempted to locate Bormann without success. In 1964, the <b>West</b> <b>German</b> government offered a reward of 100,000 Deutsche Marks for {{information leading to}} Bormann's capture. Sightings were reported at points all over the world, including Australia, Denmark, Italy, and South America. In his autobiography, Nazi intelligence officer Reinhard Gehlen claimed that Bormann had been a Soviet spy, and that he had escaped to Moscow. Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal believed that Bormann was living in South America. The <b>West</b> <b>German</b> government declared that its hunt for Bormann was over in 1971.|$|E

Ferocious confrontations pitted German armoured vehicles and infantry against the French position, which had to resist them in order to retain the Udon junction.|$|R
50|$|On September 17, 1939, {{following}} German aggression on Poland and Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, Soviet forces invaded eastern Poland. As bulk of Polish Army was {{concentrated in}} the <b>west,</b> fighting <b>Germans,</b> the Soviets met with little resistance and their troops quickly moved westwards, occupying Voivodeship’s area with ease.|$|R
5|$|Fellow <b>West</b> <b>German</b> side FC Köln {{were the}} {{opposition}} in the third round. The first leg at Köln's home ground the Müngersdorfer Stadion ended in a 0–0 draw. Borussia easily won the second leg at their home ground 5–0 to win the tie by the same score on aggregate. They were again drawn against <b>West</b> <b>German</b> {{opposition in the}} quarter-finals, the team in this instance was Kaiserslautern. The first leg held at Kaiserlautern's home ground the Fritz-Walter-Stadion was won 2–1 by Borussia and a 7–1 victory in the second leg at their home ground ensured they progressed to the semi-finals courtesy of a 9–2 aggregate victory.|$|E

5|$|In an {{interview}} with Reagan himself, he recalls the East German police not allowing people to get near the wall, which prevented the citizens from experiencing the speech at all.

5|$|One such {{success of}} {{diplomacy}} came with Willy Brandt's ascension to the <b>West</b> <b>German</b> chancellorship in 1969, as West GermanSoviet tension started to ease. Brandt's Ostpolitik policy, along with Brezhnev's détente, {{contributed to the}} signing of the Moscow and Warsaw Treaties in which West Germany recognized the state borders established following World War II, which included <b>West</b> <b>German</b> recognition of East Germany as an independent state. The foreign relations of the two countries continued to improve during Brezhnev's rule, and in the Soviet Union, where the memory of German brutality during World War II was still remembered, these developments contributed to greatly reducing the animosity the Soviet people felt towards Germany, and Germans in general.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of <b>West</b> <b>German</b> Chancellor Willy Brandt's Ostpolitik ("Eastern Policy") {{at the end}} of the 1960s reduced tensions between the two German states. It led to a series of treaties and agreements in the early 1970s, most significantly a treaty in which East and West Germany recognised each other's sovereignty and supported each other's applications for UN membership, although East Germans leaving for the West retained the right to claim a <b>West</b> <b>German</b> passport. Reunification remained a theoretical objective for West Germany, but in practice that objective was put aside by the West and abandoned entirely by the East. New crossing points were established and East German crossing regulations were slightly relaxed, although the fortifications were as rigorously maintained as ever.|$|E
40|$|This paper uses micro data {{to analyze}} the wage {{structures}} in East Germany and West Germany before and after unification. In 1988, the wage distribution in East Germany was much more compressed than in West Germany or in the U. S. Since the collapse of Communism and unification with West Germany, however, the wage structure in eastern Germany has changed considerably. In particular, wage variation has increased, the payoff to education has decreased slightly, industry differentials have expanded, and the white collar premium has increased. Although average wage growth has been remarkably high in eastern Germany, individual variation in wage growth is similar to typical western levels. The wage structure of east Germans who work in west Germany resembles the wage structure of native <b>west</b> <b>Germans</b> in some respects, but the experience-earnings profile is flat.

5|$|U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) {{documents}} declassified in 2006 {{show that}} the capture of Eichmann caused alarm at the CIA and <b>West</b> <b>German</b> Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND). Both organizations had known {{for at least two}} years that Eichmann was hiding in Argentina, but did not act, because it did not serve their interests in the Cold War to do so. Both were concerned about what Eichmann might say in his testimony about <b>West</b> <b>German</b> national security advisor Hans Globke, who had coauthored several antisemitic Nazi laws (including the Nuremberg Laws). The documents also revealed that both agencies had used some of Eichmann's former Nazi colleagues to spy on European communist countries.|$|E

5|$|As the <b>West</b> <b>German</b> public's {{awareness}} of the SS atrocities grew in the 1970s and 1980s, the attitudes towards Waffen-SS veterans shifted dramatically. The federal organisation and the local groups were ostracised, with their meetings and commemorations greeted with protests. At the same time, neo-Nazi and nationalist movements found in the Waffen-SS an icon to project their understanding of World War II.|$|E
