This paper aims to explore the role technology transfer and technology cooperation from Europe played in shaping leading firm-level <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> in China and India and to discuss whether the recent technology cooperation between Chinese, Indian and European <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> firms challenges the classical North-South technology cooperation paradigm. This paper draws on fieldwork in China, India and Europe, including qualitative interviews with about 70 experts from (<b>wind)</b> <b>energy</b> firms, business associations, research organisations and government authorities. The research finds that firm-level technology transfer and cooperation shaped the leading <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> in China, such as Goldwind’s permanent magnetic direct drive turbines, {{and to a lesser}} extent in India. In addition, the paper finds that several trends towards South-North technology cooperation have been observed between China, India and Europe, such as South-North flows of capital, South-North drivers for market access, South-North R&D leadership, while the origins of innovation (e. g. patents) seem to remain predominantly in the global North.

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 21 st century, due to increase in fossil fuel prices and environmental concerns, many countries started to invest in alternative energy resources. In addition, global environmental problems and climate change due to greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels showed the importance of renewable <b>energy</b> resources, especially <b>wind</b> <b>energy.</b> The major reason for this interest in <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> is the bulk availability of this resource without any cost. Due to increasing demand for <b>wind</b> <b>energy,</b> the <b>technology</b> and know-how in this field is increased expeditiously in this field.

40|$|The {{development}} of low emission, high output electricity generation systems is {{a focal point}} of global efforts to reduce anthropogenic {{effects of climate change}} without compromising opportunities for economic and social growth. Applications of <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> for large-scale production have been effective in meeting electricity demand to varying degrees on the international scale. While the <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> industry has grown significantly in the United States over the past decade, its contribution to overall production has been limited at both the national and local levels of implementation. Wind technologies‘ incompatibility with the national energy infrastructure is a major barrier to their incorporation into the overall US energy landscape. The current infrastructure was built around coal-fired systems, which have persisted as the primary means of meeting the electricity demand from the nineteenth century onward. Use of <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> resources is constricted by inconsistencies with traditional development. I use traditional theories of technological change applied to the current electricity system in order to show how <b>wind</b> <b>energy</b> <b>technologies</b> challenge social conceptions of energy production and distribution. Opposition at the community level is often the lethal blow to major wind development projects, as I highlight through a case study of the first proposed offshore wind project in the US. Local interests groups reacting to threats wind farms pose to the town‘s economy, ecosystems, and social welfare are strong forces in the permitting and financing process. Just as national history of energy production influences the ability of wind power to compete with coal-fired electricity, regional histories shape cultural views of relationships between humans, nature, and resource use. Economic concerns arise based on the succession of dominant industries, each change altering the region‘s political and local interest group power hierarchies...|$|R
