5|$|In 2011, it was {{announced}} that MacFarlane would be reviving The Flintstones for the Fox network, with the first episode airing in 2013. MacFarlane said that he <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> voice of Barney Rubble. However, at the San Diego Comic-Con in July 2012, while promoting Ted, MacFarlane revealed that the project had been shelved due to the unimpressed response garnered by Fox.|$|E

50|$|Sometimes entire tribal {{armies of}} irregulars {{were brought in}} from {{internal}} native or neighboring cultures, especially ones that still had an active hunting tradition to <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> basic training of irregulars. <b>The</b> regulars <b>would</b> only <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> core military in the major battles; irregulars <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> all other combat duties.|$|R
5|$|The man {{selected}} {{to lead the}} Commando force was Lieutenant Colonel Charles Newman; his No. 2 Commando <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> largest Commandos contingent, 173 men, for the raid. The Special Service Brigade headquarters used the raid to provide experience for their other units and 92 men were drawn from Nos 1, 3, 4, 5, 9, and 12 Commandos.|$|E
5|$|Young {{now had to}} {{lead the}} Saints into the far west, without knowing exactly where to go or where they would end up.

5|$|An Act of Congress created {{instruction}} in military science and tactics {{at the college}} level. As {{a result of the}} act, St. John's brought a cadet corps to campus. From 1885 to 1890, Lt. Herbert C. Squires—a veteran of the 7th U.S. Cavalry—built a cadet battalion to a strength of 200, which <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> foundation for the modern ROTC unit at Fordham. The college built a science building in 1886, lending more legitimacy to science in the curriculum. In addition, a three-year Bachelor of Science degree was created. In 1897, academic regalia for students at commencement was first adopted.|$|E

5|$|Carroll had {{considered}} {{running for the}} U.S. Senate in 1968, but {{dropped out of the}} race after just two weeks when he discovered that it would take well over $100,000 to run a competitive primary campaign. In 1971, former governor Bert T. Combs sought a second term as governor and chose Carroll as his informal running mate. (The governor and lieutenant governor were elected separately at the time.) Combs, an Eastern Kentucky native, sought geographic balance for the ticket by selecting Carroll, from the far-west Jackson Purchase. Combs said he <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> needed financing, and Carroll agreed to enter the race.|$|E
5|$|Disquiet about Belgium's {{support for}} the secessionist states led to calls within the United Nations (UN) to remove all Belgian troops from the country. The Secretary General of the UN, Dag Hammarskjöld, {{believed}} that the crisis <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> organisation {{with a chance to}} demonstrate its potential as a major peacekeeping force and encouraged the sending of a multinational contingent of peacekeepers to the Congo under UN command. On 14 July, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 143, calling for total Belgian withdrawal from the Congo and their replacement with a UN-commanded force.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong is {{considered}} to be the earliest video game with a storyline that visually unfolds on screen. The eponymous Donkey Kong character is the game's de facto villain. The hero is a carpenter originally unnamed in the Japanese arcade release, later named Jumpman and then Mario. The ape kidnaps Mario's girlfriend, originally known as Lady, but later renamed Pauline. The player must take the role of Mario and rescue her. This is the first occurrence of the damsel in distress scenario that <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> template for countless video games to come.|$|E

5|$|During the 812–813 {{siege of}} Baghdad, Tahir had {{established}} {{close ties with}} the abnaʾ, which now proved useful in smoothing their acceptance of al-Ma'mun. Tahir was further rewarded with the governorship of Khurasan in September 821, and {{when he died in}} October 822, he was succeeded by his son, Talha. For the next fifty years, the Tahirid line <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> governors of a vast eastern province centred on Khurasan, while also providing the governors of Baghdad, securing the city's loyalty to the caliphal government even after the capital was moved to Samarra.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Piketty, French {{economist}} {{and author of}} the bestselling book Capital in the Twenty-First Century regards taxes on capital as a more favorable option than austerity (inefficient and unjust) and inflation (only affects cash but neither real estates nor business capital). According to his analysis, a flat tax of 15 percent on private wealth <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> state with nearly a year's worth national income, which would allow for immediate reimbursement of the entire public debt.|$|E
5|$|When the Civil War {{broke out}} in 1861, Confederate Secretary of the Navy Stephen R. Mallory was an early enthusiast for the {{advantages}} of armor. As he looked upon it, the Confederacy could not match the industrial North in numbers of ships at sea, so {{they would have to}} compete by building vessels that individually outclassed those of the Union. Armor <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> edge. Mallory gathered about himself a group of men who could put his vision into practice, among them John M. Brooke, John L. Porter, and William P. Williamson.|$|E

5|$|With the {{introduction}} of the Douglas C-54 Skymaster four-engined transport aircraft, the United States Army Air Forces, observing that conventional gliders then in service would be an inefficient use of the C-54's power and capacity, determined that a requirement existed for a new, much larger assault glider. It was determined that the best solution to the requirement was the conversion of the Douglas C-47 Skytrain, already in large-scale production, to meet the requirement. The C-47 could be converted to a glider configuration with minimal alteration to the airframe, and <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> required capacity.|$|E
5|$|A routine became {{established}} in which salesmen <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> duckers with labels. The duckers would mark their ducklings with the labels {{of the firm}} to whom they wished them to be sold in London. The railway companies would collect ducklings, {{take them to the}} stations, ship them to London and deliver them to the designated firms, in return for a flat fee per bird. By avoiding the need for the duckers to travel to market, or the London salesmen to collect the ducklings, this arrangement benefited all concerned, and ducking became very profitable. By 1870 the duck industry was bringing over £20,000 per year into Aylesbury; a typical ducker would make a profit of around £80–£200 per year.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} attribute in {{this dog}} was a tempered aggressiveness that <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> necessary drive to pursue and bolt the fox, without resulting in physical {{harm to the}} quarry and effectively ending the chase, which was considered unsporting. Russell {{was said to have}} prided himself that his terriers never tasted blood. This line of terriers developed by John Russell was well respected for those qualities, and his dogs were often taken on by hunt enthusiasts. It is unlikely, however, that any dogs alive today can be proven to be descendants from Trump, as Russell was forced to sell all his dogs {{on more than one occasion}} because of financial difficulty, and had only four aged (and non-breeding) terriers left when he died in 1883.|$|E

5|$|Assigned to the Atlantic Transport Service, Orizaba {{carried over}} 15,000troops in six convoy trips to France {{before the end}} of World War I. In one such voyage, Orizaba’s {{executive}} officer, ordnance expert William Price Williamson, worked closely with Commander Richard Drace White—Orizaba’s commanding officer, himself an ordnance expert—to develop a workable depth charge launcher which <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> transport with a measure of protection from enemy submarines. Williamson set about modifying a Lyle gun into a depth charge launcher, and successfully tested it on 16 August 1918. While attempting another test with an increased propellant charge the following day, a defective fuse exploded the depth charge prematurely, killing Williamson and three other sailors. White, four other officers, and twenty-two enlisted men were also wounded in the blast.|$|E
5|$|During the 2009 {{parliamentary}} {{debate on the}} right to vote's status, Thio Li-ann proposed that, to avoid doubt, the right should be specifically set out in the Constitution. She argued that entrenching the right to vote through an Article in the Constitution <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to protect the details of the right. Currently, voting is regulated by the PEA. As it is an ordinary statute, it can be altered with a simple parliamentary majority by future governments seeking to amend or restrict voting rights. Thio said that expressing the right to vote clearly in the Constitution would allow aspects of that right such as voter secrecy and the universality and equality of votes to be protected from unjust manipulation.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the A refusing to cooperate, a tentative agreement was reached with the London and North Western Railway, with whom Watkin was on good terms, for the MR to build a route via Chesham to connect to LNWR mainline. This scheme <b>would</b> <b>provide</b> <b>the</b> LNWR with an alternative route into London when necessary, while providing Watkin with his long-sought connection to the north. The land required for an intermediate station near Chalfont St Giles and a line between there and a site outside Chesham was purchased. Agreement was reached with the LNWR {{that the costs of}} building the line would be shared equally by the MR and LNWR in return for the LNWR having running rights to Rickmansworth, and an Act of Parliament authorising the extension was obtained in 1885.|$|E
