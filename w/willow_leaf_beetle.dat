40|$|To {{understand}} the potential {{effects of climate}} change on the sub-alpine <b>willow</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle,</b> the cold tolerance strategy and mechanisms involved in cold tolerance were investigated for all life stages. Microhabitat choice and microclimate temperatures within each microhabitat were related to median lethal temperature for each life stage. Summer active and quiescent adults are freeze tolerant, eggs and pupae are freeze avoidant and all larval stages are chill susceptible. Quiescent adults accumulated the highest concentration of glycerol (~ 24 mM) and haemolymph osmolality (875 mOsm). Haemolymph from pupae had angular crystals suggestive of antifreeze agent activity, but this was absent in the haemolymph of other life stages. Quiescent adults must move to a thermally buffered microhabitat in the soil to survive the winter in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in California. Low temperatures beyond the limits of the cold tolerance of the <b>willow</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> occur often at the mid-willow, but the quiescent adults are protected from these cold exposures in the soil beneath the willow. Overall, the <b>willow</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> uses both behavioural avoidance strategies and physiological mechanisms to survive cold exposures in its habitat...|$|E
40|$|The {{natural enemies}} attacking eggs (and young larvae) of the <b>willow</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> Phratora vulgatissima were {{identified}} in the field. Three heteropterans were common natural enemies. The mirid Orthotylus marginalis was the most abundant and had an intermediate consumption rate in the lab, whereas the mirid Closterotomus fulvomaculatus was the least abundant but had the high-est consumption rate. The anthocorid Anthocoris nemorum was intermediate in abundance but had the lowest consumption rate. However, the experimental situation (in petridish or on shoot) affected the ranking of the predators and illustrates behavioral differences. The anthocorid was very mobile and could be characterized as a “run and eat ” predator, whereas the mirids were less mobile and behaved to a “find and stay ” principle. Possible consequences of interspecific variation in behavior, from a biological control perspective, are discussed.

40|$|Signal-based induced {{indirect}} defence {{refers to}} herbivore-induced production of plant volatiles that attract carnivorous natural enemies of herbivores. Relationships between {{direct and indirect}} defence strategies were studied using tritrophic systems consisting of six sympatric <b>willow</b> species, <b>willow</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles</b> (Plagiodera versicolora), and their natural predators, ladybeetles (Aiolocaria hexaspilota). Relative preferences of ladybeetles for prey-infested willow plant volatiles, indicating levels of signal-based induced indirect defence, were positively correlated with the vulnerability of <b>willow</b> species to <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles,</b> assigned as relative levels of direct defence. This correlation suggested a possible trade-off among the species, in terms of resource limitation between direct defence and signal-based induced indirect defence. However, analyses of volatiles from infested and uninfested plants showed that the specificity of infested volatile blends (an important factor determining the costs of signal-based induced indirect defence) {{did not affect the}} attractiveness of infested plant volatiles. Thus, the suggested trade-off in resource limitation was unlikely. Rather, principal coordinates analysis showed that this 'apparent trade-off' between direct and signal-based induced indirect defence was partially explained by differential preferences of ladybeetles to infested plant volatiles of the six willow species. We also showed that relative preferences of ladybeetles for prey-infested willow plant volatiles were positively correlated with oviposition preferences of <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles</b> and with the distributions of <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles</b> in the field. These correlations suggest that ladybeetles use the specificity of infested willow plant volatiles to find suitable prey patches...|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} and realized niches of phytophagous insects constitute an important topic in contemporary ecology. Hutchinson (1965) formulized {{the concept of}} the {{fundamental and}} realized niche with regards to species responses to interspecific competition; and for the herbivore insects’ community the consequence of interspecific competition is a debatable and questionable from the very beginning to till now. This study investigated the fundamental and the realized niche of two <b>willow</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles,</b> Galerucella lineola and Phratora vulgatissima, on two different Salix host species, S. viminalis and S. dasyclados; and how plant species affect the fundamental and realized niches of these beetle species. To achieve the objective of this study, I focused on the egg-laying preference and placement of Phratora and Galerucella eggs in monospecific and mixed conditions. The results indicate that the fundamental niches of both beetle species are dissimilar to each other and that plant species affect their fundamental niches. The two <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles</b> affect each other’s realized niche. One mechanism behind the results may be that the beetles induce changes in their shared host plants, leading to indirect interactions between the two beetles. Females could adjust their egg-laying behavior to different host plant species {{as well as to the}} presence of the opposite beetle species while ovipositing...|$|R

40|$|Aggregation {{behavior}} of herbivorous insects is mediated {{by a wide}} range of biotic and abiotic factors. It has been suggested that aggregation {{behavior of}} the blue <b>willow</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> Phratora vulgatissima is mediated by both host plant odor and by odor released by the beetles. Previous studies show that the beetles respond to plant odors according to their prior host plant experiences. Here, we analyzed the effect of the host plant species on odor released and perceived by adult P.  vulgatissima. The major difference between the odor of beetles feeding on salicin-rich and salicin-poor host plants was the presence of salicylaldehyde in the odor of the former, where both males and females released this compound. Electrophysiological studies showed that the intensity of responses to single components of odor released by beetles was sex specific and dependent on the host plant species with which the beetles were fed. Finally, behavioral studies revealed that males feeding on salicin-rich willows were attracted by salicylaldehyde, whereas females did not respond behaviorally to this compound, despite showin...|$|E
40|$|The Palaearctic leaf beetle Chrysomela lapponica usually feeds upon willows in the {{northern}} region of its occurrence. However, in Central Europe, some populations are known that have specialised on birch. In this study, we investigated the significance of other herbivores occurring together on the same host plants as possible exploitative competitors of C. lapponica. Two populations were studied: a population from Finland specialised on the willow Salix borealis, and a population from the Czech Republic, specialised on the birch Betula pubescens. Abundances of folivorous and suctivorous insects on both host plants were recorded at both population sites. The <b>willow</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> Phratora vitellinae was the most abundant herbivorous insect at both study sites on willow. A field {{study was conducted to}} examine the effects of P. vitellinae on the performance of C. lapponica. The presence of P. vitellinae larvae on the same twig upon which C. lapponica larvae were feeding did not affect increase of body weight in C. lapponica larvae. Thus, the high resource availability of both willows and birches suggest that interspecific competition is unlikely to be a selection factor driving the evolution of host shift in C. lapponica...|$|E
40|$|Published by the Indian Academy of SciencesThe {{heat shock}} {{response}} {{is a critical}} mechanism by which organisms buffer effects of variable and unpredictable environmental temperatures. Upregulation of heat shock proteins (Hsps) increases survival after exposure to stressful conditions in nature, although benefi ts of Hsp expression are often balanced by costs to growth and reproductive success. Hsp-assisted folding of variant polypeptides may prevent development of unfi t phenotypes; thus, some differences in Hsp expression among natural populations of ectotherms {{may be due to}} interactions between enzyme variants (allozymes) and Hsps. In the Sierra <b>willow</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> Chrysomela aeneicollis, which lives in highly variable thermal habitats at the southern edge of their range in the Eastern Sierra Nevada, California, allele frequencies at the enzyme locus phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) vary across a climatic latitudinal gradient. PGI allozymes differ in kinetic properties, and expression of a 70 kDa Hsp differs between populations, along elevation gradients, and among PGI genotypes. Differences in Hsp 70 expression among PGI genotypes correspond to differences in thermal tolerance and traits important for reproductive success, such as running speed, survival and fecundity. Thus, differential Hsp expression among genotypes may allow functionally important genetic variation to persist, allowing populations to respond effectively to environmental chang...|$|E

40|$|Gregarious organisms need {{to handle}} the {{trade-off}} between increasing food competition and {{the positive effects of}} group living, and this is particularly important for ovipositing females. We hypothesized that insect females consider how many conspecifics previously visited a host plant. In a no-choice assay, we show that the gregarious blue <b>willow</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> (Phratora vulgatissima) laid the most eggs and the largest clutches on plants where a sequence of few individual females was released, compared to plants where one or many different females were repeatedly released. Therefore, this species is more sensitive to the indirectly perceived number of conspecifics than the directly perceived number of eggs on a plant. We further hypothesized that females adjust their own intra-plant egg clutch distribution to that of conspecifics and discovered a new behavioral component, i. e., the modulation of distances between clutches. Females adjusted these distances in ways indicating the use of spatial memory, because the largest distance increases were observed on plants with their own clutches, compared to plants with clutches from conspecifics. However, adjustment of aggregation level and distance between clutches occurred only on a suitable, and not on an unsuitable, Salix genotype. We conclude that both behaviors should reduce competition between sibling and non-sibling larvae...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: It is {{anticipated}} that extreme population events, such as extinctions and outbreaks, {{will become more}} frequent {{as a consequence of}} climate change. To evaluate the increased probability of such events, it is crucial to understand the mechanisms involved. Variation between individuals in their response to climatic factors is an important consideration, especially if microevolution is expected to change the composition of populations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we present data of a <b>willow</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> species, showing high variation among individuals in oviposition rate at a high temperature (20 °C). It is particularly noteworthy that not all individuals responded to changes in temperature; individuals laying few eggs at 20 °C continued to do so when transferred to 12 °C, whereas individuals that laid many eggs at 20 °C reduced their oviposition and laid the same number of eggs as the others when transferred to 12 °C. When transferred back to 20 °C most individuals reverted to their original oviposition rate. Thus, high variation among individuals was only observed at the higher temperature. Using a simple population model and based on regional climate change scenarios we show that the probability of outbreaks increases if there is a realistic {{increase in the number of}} warm summers. The probability of outbreaks also increased with increasing heritability of the ability to respond to increased temperature. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: If climate becomes warmer and there is latent variation among individuals in their temperature response, the probability for outbreaks may increase. However, the likelihood for microevolution to play a role may be low. This conclusion is based on the fact that it has been difficult to show that microevolution affect the probability for extinctions. Our results highlight the urge for cautiousness when predicting the future concerning probabilities for extreme population events...|$|E

Since many animals spend a part of their life living in a group, the mechanisms involved in maintaining aggregations have been of interest to behavioral ecologists. The mechanisms of aggregation in vertebrates and social insects have been well studied; however, the mechanisms used by nonsocial insect larvae are poorly understood. Here I examine the roles that leaf quality, the presence of siblings, trails, vision, and touch play in reaggregation by imported <b>willow</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> larvae, Plagiodera versicolora (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae). This study shows that larvae respond positively to the presence of siblings their secretions, and feces while reaggregating. Larvae do not have to see or touch siblings in order for reaggregation to occur and leaf quality {{does not appear to be}} involved in reaggregation. There were differences in behavior of four-day-old and eight-day-old larvae. Four-day-old larvae responded positively to the presence of siblings while eight-day-old larvae did not. Under natural conditions four-day-old larvae are found in aggregations while eight-day-old larvae are solitary. This is the first study to demonstrate that the change from being found in aggregations to becoming solitary is a result of behavioral changes in larvae. A second experiment was conducted to test for seasonal (brood) and group size effects on larval fitness. For each of the three broods, egg group sizes of 1, 4, 8, 16, 24, and 32 were established in the field and monitored for the first six days post-hatching. There was no effect of group size on larval weight, but there was a significant effect of group size on survival. Individuals from group size of 16 had the highest survival, which coincides with the mean natural cluster size of 15. 3 eggs. There were no significant interactions between brood and group size. The effect of larval weight on adult fitness was determined in the laboratory and the field. Larval weight was correlated with egg production in the laboratory but not in the field...|$|E

40|$|<b>Leaf</b> <b>beetles</b> (Chrysomelidae) {{are one of}} {{the most}} diverse {{families}} of herbivorous insects. Many of them are important agricultural pests and cause remarkable loss of crop and money as well. Plant leaves and roots are primary food source of both larva and adults of <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles.</b> Plants produce many secondary metabolites in reaction to herbivore insects. It is a well-known phenomenon that quantity and variety of secondary metabolites in plant leaves may change in response to insect attacks.
