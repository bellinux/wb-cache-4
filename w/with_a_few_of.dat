5|$|After {{stopping}} one of Fat Tony's operations, Homer practically rids Springfield of crime. However, Fat Tony escapes and vows to kill Homer {{unless he}} leaves town. Homer {{is unable to}} get protection from the citizens he protects (only Ned Flanders volunteers, but Homer ignores his offer) and Lenny and Carl lock themselves in a jail cell. When Homer does not leave, Fat Tony arrives <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> his own henchmen (including Johnny Tightlips), as well as mafia muscle—the characters of the Sopranos series. Just before {{they are about to}} kill Homer, someone shoots the mobsters and injures them. Safe again, Homer resigns as police chief and offers the job to the first person who comes along, which is Wiggum (who notes that an identical situation is how he became chief in the first place). When Marge thanks him for saving Homer, Wiggum says that he did not shoot anyone, having lost his gun, badge and nearly his squad car. Unbeknownst to them, the person who saved Homer was Maggie, who fires at the mobsters from her window with a scoped sporting rifle.|$|E
5|$|Following {{their first}} landing in Sicily {{in the late}} 820s, the Aghlabids had tried several times, without success, to capture Syracuse. They were able to {{gradually}} take over the western half of the island, however, and in 875, a new and energetic governor, Ja'far ibn Muhammad, was appointed, determined to capture the city. Ja'far began the siege in August 877, but soon left it in charge of his son Abu Ishaq, while he retired to Palermo. The Arabs were well supplied with siege weapons, while the inhabitants of Syracuse were left largely unsupported by the Byzantine fleet, which was busy with transporting marble for a new church in Constantinople, and was then delayed by adverse weather. Consequently, the besieged populace faced great hardships and famine, described in detail by the eyewitness account of Theodosios the Monk. Finally, the Aghlabids managed to effect a breach in the seaward walls, and on 21 May 878 managed to break through it into the city. The defenders {{and much of the}} populace were massacred, while others, including Theodosios, were taken prisoner. The Byzantine patrikios who commanded the defence surrendered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> his men, but they were executed after a week, while a handful of soldiers escaped and brought the news east to the fleet that had belatedly set sail to aid the city. The Muslims were unable to capitalize upon this success due to internal rivalries, which even led to a full-scale civil war. Small-scale warfare with the Byzantines continued without any side gaining a decisive advantage until the arrival of the deposed Aghlabid emir Ibrahim II, who in 902 rallied the Sicilian Muslims and captured Taormina, effectively completing the Muslim conquest of Sicily, although a few fortresses remained in Byzantine hands until 965.|$|E

Her relationships offered her the time and energy to pursue her social work while being supported emotionally and romantically.

25|$|This poetic diary is in {{the form}} known as haibun, a {{combination}} of prose and haiku. It contains many references to Confucius, Saigyō, Du Fu, ancient Chinese poetry, and even The Tale of the Heike. It manages to strike a delicate balance between all the elements to produce a powerful account. It is primarily a travel account, and Bashō vividly relates the unique poetic essence of each stop in his travels. Stops on his journey include the Tokugawa shrine at Nikkō, the Shirakawa barrier, the islands of Matsushima, Hiraizumi, Sakata, Kisakata, and Etchū. He and Sora parted at Yamanaka, but at Ōgaki he briefly met up <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> his other disciples before departing again to the Ise Shrine and closing the account.|$|E
25|$|Pulis {{was named}} Manager of the Month for April 2007 after Stoke picked up 11 points from 5 league games. This unbeaten run lifted Stoke to {{seventh in the}} table, on equal points with sixth-place Southampton. A 1–1 draw against Queens Park Rangers {{on the final day}} of the season, however, led to Stoke {{finishing}} eighth in the Championship. Pulis sold several key players prior to the 2007–08 season; club captain Danny Higginbotham was one of a number of players to depart, joining Sunderland for £3million. Pulis, however, utilised the loan market again, signing five players on loan, including Ryan Shawcross from Manchester United, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> these loan signings joining on a permanent deal in the January transfer window.|$|E

It was from these boats that the sailors and marines of Potomac burnt the Malay vessels in Kuala Batu's harbor and assaulted the town's forts while support from the guns of Potomac herself were used to suppress the fire coming from the Malay forts. The later-day muskets the Americans used were far superior to the outdated matchlock weapons of the Malays, but the natives fought fiercely and the fighting devolved into hand-to-hand combat in which one of the uleëbalang commanding the forts was killed along with about 150 other warriors. Only two Americans died during the attack and another eleven sailors and marines suffered injuries.|$|E
25|$|In 1989 Gomez {{sold the}} team to Luis Iván Méndez, a former {{commentator}} for the team's radio broadcasts. This was a controversial move, since Méndez's extreme passion for the team was viewed with skepticism by some local fans, who considered him to be brash, arrogant, and motivated chiefly by money. As a broadcaster, Méndez had been a devil's advocate during the team's lean years, providing much necessary feedback to improve its lineup, but his comments were rather blunt at times, something that alienated team fans (he was even confrontational <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> them). The fact that Méndez was the first non-native {{of the city to}} own the team (Méndez was a native of nearby San Sebastián, Puerto Rico) did not help. Some fans even suspected Méndez of wanting to move {{the team to}} his hometown, which had a successful AA League franchise.|$|E
25|$|Elected consul for {{the second}} time in 294 BC, Megellus was given command of the forces on the {{southern}} front. He captured several towns in Samnium, but in Apulia he was routed and put to flight, and after being himself wounded he was driven into Luceria <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> his men. Returning to Rome to recover from his wounds, he dedicated the temple of Victory in Rome, built with the fines exacted during his curule aedileship. When he had recovered, he again returned to campaign in Samnium, where he captured the towns of Milionia and Ferentinum. Contradictory accounts have Megellus also campaigning in Etruria in 294 BC, but these tend to be discounted by modern scholars. At the end of the campaigning season, he celebrated a triumph over the Samnites. This triumph was notorious, as his senatorial enemies claimed that he was not entitled to one, as he had technically left the province which the Senate had assigned to him, during his return to Rome. Disregarding the opposition, he celebrated it without the Senate’s permission, which was customary, earning him a good deal of enmity.|$|E
