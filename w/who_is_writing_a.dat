Baracus and the other team had a Jewish man for the same role). The four men find Brian, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> report for the local newspaper. When Peter and his friends win the costume contest, Brian writes a report about it, and is later telephoned {{by a member of}} The New Yorker, who tell him they would like him to work for their magazine.

25|$|The next day, Julia surreptitiously hands Winston a note confessing {{her love}} for him. Winston and Julia begin an affair after Winston realizes she shares his loathing of the Party, first meeting in the country, and {{eventually}} in a rented room {{at the top of}} the antiques shop where Winston purchased the diary, which is owned by the seemingly kindly Mr. Charrington. They believe that the shop is safe, as the room has no telescreen. During his affair with Julia, Winston remembers the death of his family; during the civil war of the 1950s, Winston stole rationed chocolate from his malnourished infant sister and his mother, and would return home to discover that they had disappeared. He also recounts his terse relationship with his ex-wife Katharine, whom he was forced to have sex with and despised to such an extent that he considered pushing her off a cliff during a nature walk. Winston also interacts with his colleague Syme, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> dictionary for a revised version of the English language called Newspeak. After Syme insightfully reveals that the true purpose of Newspeak is to reduce the capacity of human thought, Winston speculates that he will be vaporized. He is later proven correct when Syme disappears without a trace, and no one acknowledges his absence.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} on All Things Considered, Yale University history professor Beverly Gage, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> biography of Hoover, stated that the film accurately conveys that Hoover came to the FBI as a reformer seeking [...] "to clean it up, to professionalize it," [...] and to introduce scientific methods to its investigation, eventually including such practices as fingerprinting and bloodtyping. She praises DiCaprio for conveying the tempo of Hoover's speech. However, she notes that the film's central narrative device in which Hoover dictates his memoirs to FBI agents chosen as writers, is fictitious: [...] "He didn't ever have the sort of formal situation {{that you see in}} the movie where he was dictating a memoir to a series of young agents, and that that is the official record of the FBI." [...] Historian Aaron J. Stockham of the Waterford School, whose dissertation was on the relationship of the FBI and the US Congress during the Hoover years, wrote on the History News Network of George Mason University, [...] "J. Edgar portrays Hoover as the man who successfully integrated scientific processes into law enforcement investigations.... There is no doubt, from the historical record, that Hoover was instrumental in creating the FBI's scientific reputation." [...] Stockham notes that Hoover probably did not write the FBI–King suicide letter to Martin Luther King, Jr., as the film portrays: [...] "While such a letter was written, Hoover almost certainly delegated it to others within the Bureau." ...|$|E
