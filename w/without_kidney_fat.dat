Young cattle in the first group (G 1) (n= 6) had average body mass of 509, 00 kg (475 - 525), in the second group (G 2) of young cattle (n= 7) average body mass of 554, 29 kg (530 – 575) was recorded and in the third group of young cattle (G 3) (n= 8) 591, 13 kg (580 – 615). Subsequent to slaughtering warm carcass sides were measured individually, with and <b>without</b> <b>kidney</b> <b>fat,</b> mass of internal organs was measured (kidneys, liver, lungs, heart, spleen) and mass of other secondary slaughter products (head, tongue, tail, muscle part of diaphragm). After cooling carcass sides were cut into main parts. Based on obtained results of research it was established that male cattle of group (G 2) of Domestic Simmental breed of average body mass of 554, 29 kg have realized higher slaughter yield compared to groups G 1 and G 3, whereas the share of kidney fat was the same in all three groups of young cattle.

40|$|From a {{literature}} review of five wildlife ecology journals since 1937, we document how using indices to monitor ungulate body condition is common practice, with the <b>kidney</b> <b>fat</b> index (KFI = weight of fat around the kidneys/weight of <b>kidneys</b> <b>without</b> <b>fat</b> × 100) as the favoured tool (82 % of studies). In this context, we highlight {{the problems of}} using indices when underlying statistical assumptions are not met (isometry, parallel slopes between treatments). We show, with real and simulated data for two cervids with contrasting fat storage strategies, how results from analysis of variance of KFI values differ from analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of raw data. We conclude that the KFI {{is affected by the}} restrictions typically associated with derived index values, and as a consequence, statistical analysis of the KFI could generate spurious results leading to erroneous interpretations concerning variation in body condition of ungulate populations. Thus, we recommend analysing fat weight as an untransformed variable in ANCOVA (kidney weight as covariate) to describe body condition variation in ungulates...|$|R
40|$|White-tailed jackrabbit (Lepus townsendii) {{populations in}} the Northern Plains {{have been in a}} general decline for the past decade or longer. A {{suggested}} reason for this population decline was reduced body condition of individual jackrabbits due to habitat changes. In order to evaluate body condition, we determined the <b>kidney</b> <b>fat</b> index of 314 white-tailed jackrabbits harvested in 44 counties throughout South Dakota. We removed and weighed kidneys and all perirenal fat associated with the kidneys from collected jackrabbits. We measured kidney weight to determine times of high metabolic activity as indicated by an increase in mass. Body condition was assessed by measuring the amount of <b>kidney</b> <b>fat</b> within each collected jackrabbit. Seasonal fluctuations were evident in average kidney weight and <b>kidney</b> <b>fat</b> for both sexes of white-tailed jackrabbits. The <b>kidney</b> <b>fat</b> index in both male and female peaked in winter and was near 0 % in summer. We believe that changes in body condition as indicated by the <b>kidney</b> <b>fat</b> index were related to the onset of breeding season rather than availability of food resources...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to compare different indices for evaluating nutritional conditions of red deer (Cervus elaphus) in an alpine environment during the autumn in order to detect the most convenient ones for management purposes in our specific situation. Body conditions of 274 red deer were evaluated using <b>kidney</b> <b>fat</b> index, back fat index and body condition scores. Body Condition Scores was the easiest but the least reliable method. Both <b>kidney</b> <b>fat</b> index and back fat index were significantly affected by age and sex class (always lower in younger animals) and, in females, also by lactation status. In stags, a negative regression effect of culling date on both <b>kidney</b> <b>fat</b> index and back fat index was observed. A significant positive correlation between <b>kidney</b> <b>fat</b> index and back fat index was recorded. Both <b>kidney</b> <b>fat</b> index and back fat index were objective indicators of nutritional status and sensitive to changes in physical conditions, but back fat index was both quicker and easier to be measured. As a direct implication, we suggest that back fat index can be a practical and reliable indicator for monitoring red deer conditions in alpine areas during the autumn, provided that the effects of sex, age and date of culling are taken into account...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{relation}} between physical condition, measured as the <b>Kidney</b> <b>Fat</b> Index (KFI), and some reproductive parameters of Lepus granatensis in Navarra province, Spain. Samples were collected between October 2001 and January 2003, totaling 174 hares (87 males and 87 females). All the hares were sexed and classified in three age categories (immature, young and adult). Fertile males and females were present in all monthly samples. Kidney weight was greater in females than in males for all the age classes and kidney weight variation along the year was not significant. Ranges of perirenal fat accumulated were larger in females but mean weight of fat for all hares was similar in males and females. Body weight and <b>kidney</b> <b>fat</b> weight was directly related both for males and females. Global pattern of fat deposition along the year was similar for both sexes.

The trial involved four phases: in P 1 all animals remained indoors; in P 2 and P 4 they were allocated on CGS or RGS; during P 3 one group remained outdoors, the other indoors. In P 1 and P 3 the steers were offered grass silage and concentrate. In P 3 the indoors group received a supplement with a medium or low-concentrate level. For the last 28 days of P 4 the steers were offered a concentrate type with 4. 9 % linseed oil or with 1. 0 % rapeseed oil. CGS-pasture resulted in higher fatty acid values than RGS-pasture; linseed-oil concentrate resulted in higher ALA, Σn- 3 and lower LA, Σn- 6 than rapeseed-oil concentrate.

Therefore, patients with kidney disease may have greater use of do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders than patients <b>without</b> <b>kidney</b> disease in the setting of an acute illness. We examined the association between advanced kidney disease and use of DNR orders in patients admitted with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) to all greater Worcester, MA, hospitals as part of an epidemiological study. METHODS: Use of DNR orders in 4, 033 Worcester residents hospitalized with AMI at 11 greater Worcester medical centers during 1997, 1999, 2001, and 2003 was examined. Advanced kidney disease was defined on the basis of serum creatinine level at the time of hospital admission. RESULTS: Forty-nine percent of patients with kidney disease and AMI had a DNR order in their medical records compared with 21 % of patients <b>without</b> <b>kidney</b> disease.

The model fitted the effects of genetic groups, order of slaughter and year of birth. Correlation coefficient between hip height and carcass weight was 0. 37, antagonistic to the amount of <b>kidney</b> <b>fat</b> (- 0. 14). High correlation coefficients were estimated between chest girth and carcass weight (0. 77), blade (0. 57), and chuck (0. 67) and positive correlations were estimated between chest girth and <b>kidney</b> <b>fat</b> (0. 38) and carcass fat (0. 52). The estimated correlation coefficient between body length and carcass weight was 0. 38. Correlation coefficients between dorsal line length, rump length and distance among pin bones and all the meat cuts of commercial interest analyzed ranged from 0. 24 to 0. 56. In addition to live body weight, chest girth and distances between hip bones can be considered an auxiliary tool for evaluation of carcass traits in Zebu and Caracu bulls. Other body measurements analyzed resulted in low or null relationship to carcass traits. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{aimed to}} describe the influence of production system on the following characteristics from seven Spanish goat breeds: carcass weight, dressing percentage, head weight, viscera weight, <b>kidney</b> <b>fat</b> weight, fatness score, carcass length, leg length, rump perimeter, rump width, <b>kidney</b> <b>fat</b> colour and tissue composition of shoulder. Experiment involved 201 male, single-birth suckling kids from five meat and two dairy breeds. Animals from meat breeds were slaughtered at two targets carcass weights (light, 4 kg; heavy, 7 kg). In dairy breeds, half of the animals were reared with dam’s milk {{and the other half}} with a milk replacer and all of them were slaughtered at light weight (4 kg). Statistics consisted in two GLM, means for each variable, a PCA to study relationships between variables and a discriminant analysis to compare breeds. In dairy breeds, breed had greater influence than milk diet, with breed effect being par-ticularly strong for kids that were fed with natural milk. In meat breeds, slaughter weight was more important than breed and many significant interactions were found between both effects. All carcass traits were closely related {{to each other and to}} slaughter weight. Slaughter weight was also positively related to dressing percentage and to fatness degree. Discriminant analysis explained 76. 1 % of variability and separated dairy breeds, with well-fattened, medium-shape...|$|R
40|$|Equations for {{estimating}} the quantities of carcass separable lean, carcass fat-free lean, carcass separable fat, total carcass fat and carcass bone were developed from carcass measurements and wholesale plate cut composition on 20 Najdi male camels (152 to 495. 5 kg body weight) representing three age groups. The independent measurements included the weights of live body, empty body, hot carcass, cold carcass, <b>kidney</b> <b>fat,</b> pelvic fat, hump fat, plate cut, lean in plate cut, fat in plate cut and bone in plate cut. The {{results revealed that}} cold carcass weight and lean weight in plate cut were the most reliable parameters for predicting the weights of carcass separable lean, carcass fat-free lean, carcass separable fat and total carcass fat. The independent variables for the best predictive equation for estimating carcass bone weight were live body weight, cold carcass weight and fat weight in plate cut...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate supplemental organic chromium (Cr) to finishing lambs on growth performance, carcass characteristics, and meat quality. Eighteen Suffolk lambs (age (4. 5 ± 0. 2) mon; (25. 8 ± 3. 6) kg body weight (BW)) were randomly assigned to three levels of supplemental organic Cr (0. 0, 0. 2 and 0. 4 mg kg– 1 dry matter (DM)) in a complete random design. Growth performance was evaluated for 70 d, and then lambs were slaughtered to study carcass characteristics and chemical composition of meat. Orthogonal contrasts were performed (contrast one-average level 0. 2 ppm Cr vs. average level 0. 4 ppm Cr; contrast two-level 0 vs. average levels (0. 2 + 0. 4) ppm Cr). Orthogonal polynomials were used to estimate the linear and quadratic effects of Cr concentrations. Growth and carcass performance were not affected by supplemental organic Cr. Muscle conformation and leg perimeter linearly increased (P< 0. 05) as organic Cr level increased in the diet. <b>Kidney</b> <b>fat</b> decreased linearly (P< 0. 05) as supplemental Cr increased. In Longissimus dorsi (LD), the ash content decreased linearly, and shear force (kg cm– 2) increased (P< 0. 05) as organic Cr level increased in the diet. It is concluded that organic Cr did not affect growth performance, but it improved positively the muscle conformation, reduced <b>kidney</b> <b>fat,</b> whereas in LD there was an increment in shear force in finishing carcass lambs...|$|R
