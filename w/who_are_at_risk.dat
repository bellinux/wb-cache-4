5|$|In Klein ISD, grades pre-kindergarten through grade 5 are {{considered}} a part of elementary school, grades 6 through 8 are in intermediate school, and grades 9 through 12 a part of high school. The district also offers a Pre-Kindergarten campus for {{certain areas of the}} district for students who have not yet entered elementary school. Additionally, Klein ISD offers the Vistas High School Program for high school students <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for not graduating. The program is offered to all Klein ISD high school students who are admitted based on an application and interview process. , Klein ISD operates 32 elementary schools (including Grace England Early Childhood & Pre-K Center), nine intermediate schools, and five high schools.|$|E
5|$|Pneumonia, another {{potential}} complication, develops {{in as many}} as 20% of people with pulmonary contusion. Contused lungs are less able to remove bacteria than uninjured lungs, predisposing them to infection. Intubation and mechanical ventilation further increase the risk of developing pneumonia; the tube is passed through the nose or mouth into the airways, potentially tracking bacteria from the mouth or sinuses into them. Also, intubation prevents coughing, which would clear bacteria-laden secretions from the airways, and secretions pool near the tube's cuff and allow bacteria to grow. The sooner the endotracheal tube is removed, the lower the risk of pneumonia, but if it is removed too early and has to be put back in, the risk of pneumonia rises. People <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for pulmonary aspiration (e.g. those with lowered level of consciousness due to head injuries) are especially likely to get pneumonia. As with ARDS, the chances of developing pneumonia increase with the size of the contusion. Children and adults have been found to have similar rates of complication with pneumonia and ARDS.|$|E

25|$|Hyperkalemia (high {{concentration}} of potassium in the blood) is another possible complication of treatment with an ACE inhibitor {{due to its}} effect on aldosterone. Suppression of angiotensin II leads to a decrease in aldosterone levels. Since aldosterone is responsible for increasing the excretion of potassium, ACE inhibitors can cause retention of potassium. Some people, however, can continue to lose potassium while on an ACE inhibitor. Hyperkalemia may decrease the velocity of impulse conduction in the nerves and muscles, including cardiac tissues. This leads to cardiac dysfunction and neuromuscular consequences, such as muscle weakness, paresthesia, nausea, diarrhea, and others. Close monitoring of potassium levels is required in patients receiving treatment with ACE inhibitors <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of hyperkalemia.|$|E
25|$|Monovision {{is the use}} of single-vision lenses (one {{focal point}} per lens) to focus an eye (typically the {{dominant}} one) for distance vision and the other for near work. The brain then learns to use this setup to see clearly at all distances. A technique called modified monovision uses multifocal lenses and also specializes one eye for distance and the other for near, thus gaining the benefits of both systems. Alternatively, a person may simply wear reading glasses over their distance contact lenses. Care is advised for persons with a previous history of strabismus and those with significant phorias, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of eye misalignment under monovision. Studies have shown no adverse effect to driving performance in adapted monovision contact lens wearers.|$|E
25|$|When {{currently}} available implants are used, cemented stems {{tend to have}} a better longevity than uncemented stems. No significant difference is observed in the clinical performance of the various methods of surface treatment of uncemented devices. Uncemented stems are selected for patients with good quality bone that can resist the forces needed to drive the stem in tightly. Cemented devices are typically selected for patients with poor quality bone <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of fracture during stem insertion. Cemented stems are less expensive due to lower manufacturing cost, but require good surgical technique to place them correctly. Uncemented stems can cause pain with activity in up to 20% of patients during the first year after placement as the bone adapts to the device. This is rarely seen with cemented stems.|$|E

25|$|According to the Global Hunger Index, {{a multidimensional}} tool {{used to measure}} and track a country's hunger levels, Burkina Faso ranked 65 out of 78countries in 2013. It is {{estimated}} that there are currently over 1.5 million children <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of food insecurity in Burkina Faso, with around 350,000children who {{are in need of}} emergency medical assistance. However, only about a third of these children will actually receive adequate medical attention. Only 11.4percent of {{children under the age of}} two receive the daily recommended number of meals. Stunted growth as a result of food insecurity is a severe problem in Burkina Faso, affecting at least a third of the population from 2008 to 2012. Additionally, stunted children, on average, tend to complete less school than children with normal growth development, further contributing to the low levels of education of the Burkina Faso population.|$|E
25|$|The Benton Test is {{sensitive}} to many forms of brain impairments and diseases, {{but it is difficult}} to diagnose a particular disease through the test. In fact, according to the test manual, a high number of a single category of error should not be used as a diagnosis, but should lead to further testing. High amounts of perseverations, for example, suggests frontal lobe damage, while the omission of peripheral designs suggests potential brain trauma, especially in the right parietal lobe. Overall performance does not seem to distinguish those with unilateral left or right hemisphere damage. Nevertheless, examiners have shown to be able to discriminate among perceptual, memory, and motor impairments based on analysis of the test results. Dementia, brain lesions, thalamic stroke, and Alzheimer's disease are among the afflictions that have been shown to greatly reduce an individual's BVRT score. Both the copy and memory versions of the test are especially sensitive to dementia, and may help identify individuals <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for developing Alzheimer's later. In addition, learning disabilities among children are able to be identified through the Benton Test. In 1983, the Benton Test was included in the Neurobehavioral Core Test Battery (NCTB) to identify the effects of chemical exposure on the nervous system and has since been used to assess chemical exposure in the workplace. From its use in the NCTB, the Benton Test has shown sensitivity to various chemical exposures, including mercury exposure, lead exposure, and pesticide exposure.|$|E

500|$|The risk {{of death}} in hepatorenal {{syndrome}} is very high; consequently, {{there is a significant}} emphasis on the identification of patients <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> for HRS, and prevention of triggers for onset of HRS. [...] As infection (specifically spontaneous bacterial peritonitis) and gastrointestinal hemorrhage are both complications in individuals with cirrhosis, and are common triggers for HRS, specific care is made in early identification and treatment of cirrhotics with these complications [...] to prevent HRS. [...] Some of the triggers for HRS are induced by treatment of ascites and can be preventable. [...] The aggressive use of diuretic medications should be avoided. [...] In addition, many medications that are either used to treat cirrhotic complications (such as some antibiotics) or other conditions may cause sufficient impairment in kidney function in the cirrhotic to lead to HRS. [...] Also, large volume paracentesis—which is the removal of ascites fluid from the abdomen using a needle or catheter in order to relieve discomfort—may cause enough alteration in hemodynamics to precipitate HRS, and should be avoided in individuals at risk. [...] The concomitant infusion of albumin can avert the circulatory dysfunction that occurs after large-volume paracentesis and may prevent HRS. [...] Conversely, in individuals with very tense ascites, it has been hypothesized that removal of ascitic fluid may improve kidney function if it decreases the pressure on the renal veins.|$|E
500|$|Sex Trade 101 {{calls itself}} [...] "Toronto's only sex trade {{survivors}} and abolitionist organization" [...] and {{is composed of}} 12 women who had escaped forced prostitution and who offer training for police in order to change perceptions about {{people involved in the}} sex trade. The organization is also involved in prevention work in high schools. The organization offers mentorship and peer support groups for women who are currently or were formerly in prostitution. It also partners with other organizations including the Servants Anonymous Society of Calgary and Sheatre, an Owen Sound-based interactive theatre company. In 2012, Falle and Bridget Perrier represented Sex Trade 101 in Owen Sound where they launched ReStart, a mentorship program to aid women and youth <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>at</b> <b>risk</b> of sexual victimization, to help people exit the sex trade, and to provide support once they have exited. At the workshop that launched this program, Falle said that some people in the sex industry engage in survival sextrading sex for food, a place to sleep, alcohol, drugs, or the feeling that they are loved. She said that rural communities are common places for women and children to be groomed into prostitution. She identified Bruce—Grey—Owen Sound as particularly vulnerable because of the substance abuse in the area. By 2013, Sex Trade 101 had served more than 1,000 women. In May 2012, Falle spoke about human trafficking at high schools in Vancouver primarily because of the influence of a parent concerned about human trafficking in the area and its dangers to children.|$|E
