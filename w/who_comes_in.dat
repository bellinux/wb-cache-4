Robinson testified that during Lamb's time in the county jail, his conduct had been impeccable except for an incident five weeks before the trial, on 10 December 1966, when he had, for no apparent reason, gone on what Robinson called a [...] "rampage". In an episode lasting three hours, the defendant had smashed over 100 windows, set fire to blankets and broken plumbing, causing cells to flood.

This, he said, had boiled over into an [...] "acute schizoid episode" [...] {{on the night of the}} shootings. In cross-examination, Scott was pressed as to why he had allowed Lamb's release from Kingston if this was the case; he replied that although the prison officers had been concerned about Lamb's mental state on his release, there had not been conclusive grounds to certify him insane at that time.|$|E

In a 2010 retrospective of the Top 80 Iconic Performances of Bollywood, Filmfare noted [...] "how flesh and blood Hrithik's act is. Simply because he believes he is the part.

500|$|The {{second season}} had ten roles {{receiving}} star billing, out of whom nine were {{returning from the}} first season. All the actors who appear as series regulars portray physicians from the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, specialized in surgery. Ellen Pompeo acted as Meredith Grey, the protagonist and the narrator of the series, a surgical intern who struggles to balance the difficulties of the competitive career she has chosen, with her troubled personal background. Sandra Oh portrayed highly competitive intern Cristina Yang, who suffers a miscarriage just as she starts accepting her upcoming motherhood. Katherine Heigl played intern Izzie Stevens, in a continuous struggle to be looked upon as a doctor, not the model she used to be. Justin Chambers acted as Alex Karev, who begins to develop an emotional side of his personality, after being introduced as arrogant and selfish. T.R. Knight {{played the role of}} intern George O'Malley, whose insecurity and lack of self-confidence evolve due to his unshared feelings for Meredith Grey. Chandra Wilson portrayed surgical resident and brilliant general surgeon Miranda Bailey, the mentor of the five interns, whose rudeness and cold attitude earns her the nickname [...] "The Nazi". James Pickens, Jr. portrayed Seattle Grace Hospital's Chief of Surgery, Richard Webber, whose relationship with Meredith Grey's mother, which occurred twenty-one years ago, threatens to ruin his marriage. Isaiah Washington played the role of attending physician and cardiothoracic surgeon Preston Burke, who learns that Cristina, with whom he had a sexual relationship, is pregnant with his child. Patrick Dempsey portrayed attending neurosurgeon Derek Shepherd, whose relationship with intern Meredith Grey has been {{the focal point of the}} series since its inception. Although originally conceived as a guest star with a five-episode story arc, Kate Walsh decided to extend her contract following positive reviews from critics and fans, resulting in her getting promoted to series regular status. Being the first addition to the original cast from the first season, Walsh began receiving star billing in the seventh episode of the season, portraying obstetrician-gynaecologist and world-class neonatal surgeon Addison Montgomery Shepherd, <b>who</b> <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> Seattle seeking reconciliation with her estranged husband, Derek Shepherd.|$|E

No attempt is made to resolve the situation, and if that's a happy ending, I've seen happier. Despite its creativity, the film remains space opera and avoids the higher realms of science-fiction." [...] Josh Tyler of Cinema Blend says the film is unique in interpretation and execution, but considers {{it to be a}} knockoff of the 1988 film Alien Nation.|$|E

However, by 1945, their preliminary story work was halted. During the writing stages of Song of the South, Dalton S. Reymond and Maurice Rapf entered into a personal dispute, in which Raft was reassigned to write for Cinderella. In his version, Cinderella was written to be a less passive character than Snow White, and more rebellious against her stepfamily. Raft explained, [...] "My thinking was you can't have somebody <b>who</b> <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> and changes everything for you. You can't be delivered it on a platter. You've got to earn it. So in my version, the Fairy Godmother said, 'It's okay till midnight but from then in it's up to you.'

2500|$|The Sheriff of the NC {{county is}} the highest ranking law {{enforcement}} officer {{in each of the}} state's 100 counties and has complete at-will power to hire and terminate personnel at his-her will and pleasure. Deputies and jailers serve a term concurrent with the sheriff, not to exceed 4 years and must be re-sworn every 4 years. Jailers are custodial officers and must complete a 160-hour jailer training course, though some are also dually trained and sworn as deputies. Deputies must complete the state mandated 600+ hour Basic Law Enforcement Training (BLET) course, or do a [...] "re-entry" [...] or reentry syllabus for former or lateral (out of state officers). Other than the reentry option, the training for deputies is the same as for police officers, and other peace officers to be certified. The sheriff however, can hire deputies and has one year to get them trained and certified. This allows a sheriff <b>who</b> <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> office to, if he-she chooses, to replace an entire or partial department with untrained appointees and there is then one year to get the new deputies trained and certified. Deputies are a political extension of the sheriff and have no independent statutory power and when an arrest or action is made in an official capacity, it is done {{in the name of the}} sheriff as a de facto power of attorney. This is why legally, a sheriff, unlike a police chief, can dismiss arrests and charges filed by deputies for any or no reason, and this is done frequently for political purposes, Police chiefs cannot do so, as the officers are a separate and distinct legal entity named in legislation, ...|$|E

Criticism was varied. The New York Post’s Kyle Smith objected that, [...] "Good and evil don't seem {{to be trying to}} destroy each other so much as come up with cool-looking effects to show off, as if they were competing in a [...] "Project Runway" [...] for wizards... given superpowers, Will does approximately nothing with them." [...] Gianni Truzzi of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer opined that the movie lacked the [...] "grandiose elements" [...] of [...] "magic rooted in its ties to Arthurian legend and British folklore" [...] that made the books so memorable. The Boston Globe’s [...] Ty Burr panned the movie for not understanding its intended audience of book-readers, saying, [...] "the producers have tried to gin up the story for multiplex audiences. They've succeeded in making a movie for no audience at all." [...] And The New York Timess Jeannette Catsoulis complained that [...] "John Hodge's screenplay is frequently dreary and overly literal... The Seeker feels passé and lacks a charismatic lead." [...] One of the few somewhat-positive reviews came from the Chicago Tribune's Kelley L. Carter, who said that [...] "At its best, The Seeker is a pretty vivid fantasy book come-to-life" [...] and found the lead character of Will Stanton to have been [...] "played convincingly." [...] Another came from the Baltimore Suns Michael Sragow, who found that The Seeker had [...] "a lot going for it, including wonderful sets and locations...that create a heightened-reality English hamlet". Both gave the movie only 2½ stars out of 4. Several of the reviewers mentioned the Harry Potter movies. The New York Timess Catsoulis mentioned, [...] "Too bad Daniel Radcliffe is an only child." [...] The Chicago Tribunes Carter wrote, [...] "Harry Potter, meet your not-so-much cousin... {{had it not been for}} the Potter series, the bar for children’s fantasy film wouldn’t be quite as high, and The Seeker falls short of the high-riding, high-quality material delivered in the Harry Potter film series." [...] The New York Posts Smith went so far as to title his review [...] "Bad Harry Day" [...] and to joke that [...] "In today's England, a teenage boy is instructed by grown-up mentors in the use of magical powers while a dark lord <b>who</b> <b>comes</b> <b>in</b> many formats promises an epic battle. The movie is based on a 1973 book by Susan Cooper, who must be trembling in fear of being sued for ripping off J.K. Rowling's ideas and publishing them 20 years in advance." [...] The Boston Globes Burr described the parallels more clearly, saying that [...] "against him is a metrosexual meanie called The Rider (Christopher Eccleston), sort of a He Who Can Be Named.
