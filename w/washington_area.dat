5|$|For {{much of the}} year, the {{garrison}} would be plagued by mosquitoes and the heat and humidity common to the <b>Washington</b> <b>area</b> during the summer. Though Fort Greble was built on a hill, the area immediately surrounding the fort consisted of swampy bottomland drained by the Anacostia and Potomac rivers, {{a breeding ground for}} malaria. Communication with the outside world was provided by the military road that served the Eastern Branch line of forts, and supply wagons would usually arrive on a weekly schedule. Trips to Washington or Uniontown from the fort were uncommon, and by virtue of its location at the extreme end of the Eastern Branch defenses, Fort Greble was isolated even from its neighboring forts.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, logging {{began in}} the Pinkham area. After almost total {{deforestation}} of the White Mountain region, the White Mountain National Forest was created in 1911, and the Mount <b>Washington</b> <b>area</b> {{was added to the}} national forest in 1914. With the preservation of the area, emphasis shifted from logging to recreation. The Appalachian Mountain Club converted a logging camp near the height-of-land into what is now the Pinkham Notch Visitor Center in 1921. The Appalachian Trail was built through the visitor center, making it an important trailhead for ascents of Mount Washington. Meanwhile, ski trails began to be constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps on Wildcat Mountain, and the ski resort was opened in 1958.|$|E

5|$|Starting in {{the mid-19th}} century, the <b>Washington</b> <b>area</b> had been {{served by a}} variety of private bus lines and {{streetcar}} services, including extensions of Northern Virginia trolleys. Over time, most were absorbed into the Capital Transit Company, formed on December 1, 1933, by the amalgamation of the Washington Railway, Capital Traction, and Washington Rapid Transit. Financier Louis Wolfson acquired the company in 1949 but had his franchise revoked in 1955 amidst a crippling strike. Congress then awarded a 20-year concession to O. Roy Chalk on the condition that he replace the city's remaining streetcars with buses by 1963. The company was thereafter known as DC Transit.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{existence}} or upcoming construction of two divided highway corridors between Baltimore and Annapolis, a freeway connecting I-695 and US 50 was proposed {{as early as}} 1956 {{in the form of}} the Arundel Expressway, which would relieve congestion on MD 2. The portion of the Arundel Expressway that is today MD 10 was constructed from I-695 to MD 648 in Pasadena between 1970 and 1978. MD 10 was proposed to continued south of Pasadena as a toll road to US 50, but the section of the freeway south of MD 100 was removed from state plans by 1975. MD 10 was completed to its present end in Pasadena in 1991. The state of Maryland unsuccessfully petitioned the Federal Highway Administration for an Interstate designation for a Baltimore–Annapolis freeway after passage of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1968. However, the state was successful in obtaining Interstate mileage for the Baltimore–Annapolis corridor through the 1968 Howard–Cramer amendment, which provided for minor adjustments to the Interstate System if no additional costs were incurred. Much of the mileage of what became I-97 was reallocated from canceled Interstate Highways in Baltimore and the <b>Washington</b> <b>area.</b>|$|E
