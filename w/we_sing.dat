25|$|Mathieu {{began her}} career by {{participating}} in an annual singing contest in Avignon called On Chante dans mon Quartier (<b>We</b> <b>sing</b> in my neighborhood). Photos depict the affair as rather drab with a cheap curtain and one projector light. The stage was only twenty feet square, and the singer having to share that with a large piano and musicians. One cannot help but notice the large, boisterous, and mostly young audience. The judges {{sat at a table}} in front of and below the elevated stage. Anyone who signed the contract in the weeks before the show was allowed to sing. Talent scouts made this a worthwhile event for singers within hundreds of kilometers to participate in.|$|E

25|$|Garrett {{made her}} Broadway debut in 1942 in the revue Of V <b>We</b> <b>Sing,</b> which closed after 76 {{performances}} but {{led to her}} being cast in the Harold Rome revue Let Freedom Sing later that year. It closed after only eight performances, but producer Mike Todd saw it and signed her to understudy Ethel Merman and play a small role in the 1943 Cole Porter musical Something for the Boys. Merman became ill during the run, allowing Garrett to play the lead for a week. During this time she was seen by producer Vinton Freedley, who cast her in Jackpot, a Vernon Duke/Howard Dietz musical also starring Nanette Fabray and Allan Jones. The show closed quickly, and Garrett began touring the country with her nightclub act.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to the violent nature of the verses, the emergence of major chords creates a feeling of hope during Bono's [...] "How long, how long must <b>we</b> <b>sing</b> this song?" [...] refrain. During the chorus, the Edge's backing vocals further develop this tread, using a harmonic imitative echo. The snare drum is absent from this section, and the guitar parts are muted. This part of the song deviates musically from the raw aggression seen in the song's verses and gives the song a more uplifting structure. Bono once commented that [...] "love is...a central theme" [...] of [...] "Sunday Bloody Sunday" ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2012, Little Mix begun {{recording}} {{songs for}} their debut album. The group worked with production team TMS, and Iain James {{on a number}} of songs at The Music Shed in London, England, four of which were chosen for the album. One of these four songs was [...] "DNA," [...] which subsequently became the title of the album. The song originated from the group's personal experiences in romantic situations. The group wanted to create a song about their own experiences so that they could improve the quality of their live performances. Edwards said: [...] "We perform better when the lyrics mean something to us when <b>we</b> <b>sing</b> them." [...] "DNA" [...] was developed to manifest a completely different side to Little Mix. When creating the song, Little Mix took into consideration which of their performances during their time on The X Factor was the most popular. Their performance of Katy Perry's [...] "E.T." [...] was the week during The X Factor where the group received the most votes. The group's version of [...] "E.T." [...] was perceived as [...] "quite dark" [...] by Jade Thirlwall, in turn, Thirlwall said that the group wanted [...] "DNA" [...] to showcase a darker side of the group. Thirlwall told Sarah Dean of The Huffington Post that the song was also inspired to show how the group has grown in maturity.|$|E

500|$|Like Ice-T's {{gangsta rap}} albums, Body Counts {{material}} focused on various {{social and political}} issues, with songs focusing on topics ranging from police brutality to drug abuse. According to Ernie C, [...] "Everybody writes about whatever they learned growing up, and we were no exception. Like The Beach Boys sing about the beach, <b>we</b> <b>sing</b> {{about the way we}} grew up." [...] Ice-T states that [...] "Body Count was an angry record. It {{was meant to be a}} protest record. I put my anger in it, while lacing it with dark humor." [...] The spoken introduction, [...] "Smoked Pork" [...] features Ice-T taking on the roles of a gangster pretending to be seemingly stranded motorist and a police officer who refuses to aid. The track begins with Mooseman and Ice-T driving their car towards a police car, and then Ice-T asks for the gun Mooseman has and tells Mooseman to stay in the car, much to Mooseman's chagrin, as Mooseman wanted to kill the cop in this round. Ice-T then walks up to the policeman, pretending to be a stranded motorist, asking for help, but the policeman refuses, saying: [...] "Nah, that's not my job! My job's not to help your fuckin' ass out!", then telling him that [...] "my job is eatin' these doughnuts". When the officer recognizes Ice-T, gunshots are heard. The final voice on the track is Ice-T confirming his identity.|$|E
500|$|British singer-songwriter Jessie J {{recorded}} {{a cover of}} [...] "Part of Your World" [...] for the compilation album We Love Disney (2015). Jessie J decided to record it because she had enjoyed it as a child. She {{said that she would}} sometimes envision herself singing the song while combing her hair using a fork. The cover's arrangement {{is similar to that of}} the original, combined with the singer's [...] "uniquely feminine self-awareness". Jessie J's performance has been met with very positive reviews. AllMusic critic Neil Z. Yeung deemed it [...] "a stunner". Entertainment Weeklys Madison Vain commended Jessie J's [...] "power and control [...] highlighting the best nuances of Ariel’s famous tune." [...] While admitting her preference for Benson's original, Rebecca Rose of Cosmopolitan agreed that Jessie J's version is [...] "stunning" [...] and [...] "extremely enchanting", demonstrating the singer's [...] "perfect" [...] vocals. E! ranked the cover the album's best track, joking, [...] "It's how we all wish we sounded when <b>we</b> <b>sing</b> it in the shower." [...] In 2016, singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles performed an impromptu rendition of [...] "Part of Your World" [...] live at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre to entertain audiences while waiting for a production of her Broadway musical Waitress (2015), to recover from a technical malfunction involving a set piece. The performance was humorous and interactive, with Bareilles encouraging the initially confused audience members to sing along with her. Bareilles would eventually perform the same song in a concert adaptation of The Little Mermaid at the Hollywood Bowl, in which played Ariel. To commemorate the film's 25th anniversary in 2014, Billboard published a list of the website's [...] "Favorite 'Part Of Your World' Covers".|$|E

50|$|We worked {{really hard}} in those days, for one song {{had to be}} sung {{perfectly}} at least six times. The records thus made would be played back again and further records made from them. The conditions under which we recorded were crude in the extreme. <b>We</b> <b>sang</b> in a tiny bare room and into a big tin trumpet, which was connected direct to the recording needle by a rubber tube. <b>We</b> <b>sang</b> collarless and in shirt sleeves, for the place quickly grew stifling.

2500|$|Most Japanese musicians {{felt that}} they could not sing rock in Japanese, so the {{popularity}} of Japanese rock gradually declined. As a result, there were debates such as [...] "Should <b>we</b> <b>sing</b> rock music in Japanese?" [...] and [...] "Should <b>we</b> <b>sing</b> in English?" [...] between Happy End and Yuya Uchida about Japanese rock music. This confrontation was called [...] Happy End proved that rock music could be sung in Japanese, and one theory holds that their music became one of the origins of modern J-pop. The Beatles also inspired Eikichi Yazawa, {{who grew up in a}}n underprivileged family, his father dying when he was a child. Keisuke Kuwata, who grew up in a dual-income family, was influenced by the Beatles through his older sister, then an avid fan. Yōsui Inoue was also a fan of The Beatles, but he said that his music style was not particularly related to them. After Happy End disbanded in 1973, Haruomi Hosono, a former member, began a solo career and later formed Yellow Magic Orchestra.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{not simply}} a visit to Australia, but part of a tour round the world, what Quinlan himself in an {{interview}} on arrival in Sydney, called an [...] "All-Red Tour" [...] (a phrase which meant something rather different {{in the days before the}} sun set on the British Empire). The intention was to return to England via New Zealand and Canada, [...] "never", said Quinlan, [...] "leaving the red portions of the geographical map except to hop over the border from Canada to visit some of our American cousins.... <b>We</b> <b>sing</b> in English to English-speaking peoples all the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The RBB have {{received}} much praise and attention for {{the atmosphere and}} passion they produce, most notably their call-and-response chant [...] "Who do <b>we</b> <b>sing</b> for?".

2500|$|Of course {{everything}} {{depends on}} the repertoire which is quite large – more than two thousand works. Depending on the concert we choose a special repertoire. We have a rule that {{we try not to}} break. In any country <b>we</b> <b>sing</b> 2–3 songs in the native language {{of the people who live}} there. As a rule it helps to find a rapport with, and the appreciation of, the audience. And for us it is some kind of musical gift, to honour the host country and its people. For instance in Canada when we sang the National Anthem of Russia people stood up to show respect to our country, and when we finished we sang their country's anthem Oh, Canada!.|$|E

2500|$|The {{mixture of}} {{material}} in Nights of Fire! includes Brazilian samba, Cuban salsa, Spanish flamenco, Argentine tango, even African tribal chants and drums. The production received an Emmy for its costumes. [...] Benise says, [...] "I appreciate music {{from all over}} the world and I believe that feeling has allowed me to embrace them all, to incorporate them into the songs that I write, the music <b>we</b> <b>sing,</b> the shows we perform. When people ask what it is, I tell them it’s a combination of blues, jazz, salsa, rock and more, but in a hipper style." [...] Some describe Roni Benise's Nights of Fire! as a cross between Latin Riverdance and Cirque du Soleil. The 40-person cast includes exotic drums, Gypsy violin, flamenco dancers, circus performers, Brazilian samba dancers and percussionists, African tribal drummers, horns and lighting technicians.

2500|$|Richard Corliss {{also notes}} that the song was even more {{significant}} having been released soon after America entered World War II: [...] "connected with...

[...] Poet Carl Sandburg wrote, [...] "We have learned {{to be a little}} sad and a little lonesome without being sickly about it. This feeling is caught in the song of a thousand jukeboxes and tune whistled in streets and homes. [...] "I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas'. When <b>we</b> <b>sing</b> that we don't hate anybody. And there are things we love that we're going to have sometimes if the breaks are not too bad against us. Way down under this latest hit of his, Irving Berlin catches us where we love peace." ...|$|E
