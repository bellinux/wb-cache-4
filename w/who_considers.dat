5000|$|Carl Linnaeus {{named the}} {{domestic}} cat Felis catus in 1758; Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber named the wildcat Felis silvestris in 1775. For taxonomists <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> these {{two kinds of}} cat a single species the Principle of Priority means that the species ought to be named F. catus, but in practice almost all biologists have used F. silvestris. In 2003, the Commission issued a ruling (Opinion 2027) that [...] "conserved the usage of 17 specific names based on wild species, which are pre-dated, by or contemporary with those based on domestic forms", confirming F. silvestris for the wild cat. Taxonomists <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> the domesticated cat the same species as the wild cat should use F. silvestris; taxonomists <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> the domesticated cat a subspecies of the wild cat should use F. silvestris catus; taxonomists <b>who</b> <b>consider</b> the domesticated cat a separate species should use F. catus.|$|R

5|$|The chronicles of Genesios and Theophanes Continuatus (and {{following}} them Skylitzes and Zonaras), however, {{report that he}} survived his wounds, allegedly being miraculously cured after renouncing iconoclasm {{at the behest of}} some monks. The same sources report that after Theophilos's death, he assumed the overall command of the Byzantine army and was appointed a member of the regency council for the infant new emperor Michael III (r. 842–867) along with Theoktistos and Bardas. His standing was so high that the populace is said to have acclaimed him as emperor at the Hippodrome, but he refused to accept the post. The same writers report that he {{played an important role in}} the restoration of the icons, and that he became a protomagistros before falling out with Theoktistos, being accused of lèse-majesté, and retiring from public life to his estates. According to the same sources, in the late 850s, he saved the Emperor's life in another battle at Anzen and died shortly after. Traditional scholarship has largely accepted this account, but some modern historians have expressed doubts as to its veracity. The Belgian Byzantinist Henri Grégoire was the first to highlight its incompatibility with the narrative of Symeon Logothetes, speculating that it was a later invention, possibly carried out by the monks of the Monastery of Manuel, who venerated him as a saint and tried to mitigate his iconoclast past. Warren Treadgold, <b>who</b> <b>considers</b> Symeon Logothetes more reliable, also dismissed the reports of Manuel's post-838 survival as invented.|$|E
