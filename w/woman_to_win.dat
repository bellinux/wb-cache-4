Neuner ended the season with her 19th World Cup win in Khanty-Mansiysk's mass start, which ensured her the 2009–10 Overall World Cup, making her the first German <b>woman</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the Biathlon World Cup for a second time. She also won the pursuit and mass start discipline World Cups. In the last event of the winter, the Mixed Relay World Championship, she won gold, alongside Simone Hauswald, Simon Schempp and Arnd Peiffer, to claim her seventh world title.|$|E
5|$|Further medal {{success was}} {{anticipated}} at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, which were attended by 24 Australian athletes. Zali Steggall, who months earlier {{had become the}} first Australian <b>woman</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> a World Cup event and was ranked sixth in the world, won the country's first individual medal with a bronze in slalom skiing. Her time of 1m 32.67s was only 0.27s behind the gold medallist. Marshall, the world champion in 1997 and 1999, and Jacqui Cooper—ranked second in the world—were expected {{to do well in}} the aerials, but both crashed and failed to make the final.

In 2007, Mackey {{became the first}} to win both the Yukon Quest and the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, a feat he repeated the following year. The longest race time was in 1988, when Ty Halvorson took 20days, 8hours, and 29minutes to finish. In 2000, Aliy Zirkle became the first <b>woman</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the race, in 10days, 22hours, and 57minutes.

5|$|In 2008 Clinton, a Senator and {{candidate}} for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, became the first American <b>woman</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> a presidential primary. Traister discusses Clinton's political campaign, which did not focus on her gender, and the misogynistic reactions she received from the media and political opponents. She argues that the Democratic Party's lack of response to the sexism of Clinton's opponents led {{a large number of}} liberal female voters to abandon the party, and blames Mark Penn for advising Clinton not to advertise herself as a feminist. Although she originally supported John Edwards' candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination, she became a strong supporter of Clinton.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} contest of the {{primaries}} season, Clinton only very narrowly won the Iowa Democratic caucuses, held February 1, over an increasingly popular Sanders, making {{her the first}} <b>woman</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the Iowa caucuses. In the first primary, held in New Hampshire on February 9, she lost to Sanders by a wide margin. Sanders was an increasing threat in the next contest, the Nevada caucuses on February 20, but Clinton managed a five-percentage-point win, aided by final-days campaigning among casino workers. Clinton followed that with a lopsided victory in the South Carolina primary on February 27. These two victories stabilized her campaign and showed an avoidance of the management turmoil that harmed her 2008 effort.|$|E

Robinson went to France to compete in the Paul Ricard Grand Prix Truck Race the following year, and took second in the 1986 Grand Prix of Trucks held in Mexico City. Robinson was victorious in the GATR Big Rig race at Flemington Speedway in 1987.|$|E
5|$|In the women's event, Germany's Silke Kraushaar {{leads the}} medal count with three, {{one of each}} color. Steffi Martin and Sylke Otto—at 36, the oldest female {{individual}} gold medalist at the Winter Games—are the only lugers with two gold medals in their career. Ortrun Enderlein, representing the Unified Team of Germany, was the first <b>woman</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> the singles event in 1964. She {{was on the verge}} of defending her title at the 1968 Grenoble Games, having the best overall time after all the runs, but was disqualified together with fellow countrywomen Anna-Maria Müller (2nd) and Angela Knösel (4th) when it was discovered that the runners in their sleds had been illegally heated before the runs. Müller made up for this by taking the gold medal at the following Games, in Sapporo, Japan.|$|E
