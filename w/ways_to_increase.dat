5|$|Flower {{production}} {{is related to}} increasing day length, and in general, plants produced the most flowers from December to March. Varying planting times or artificially changing light levels might be <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> production of flowers outside these months.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{while the}} Government of Pakistan {{was looking for}} <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> the country's {{strategic}} store of oil to 90 days, the PMDC put forward a proposal to use the Khewra mines to store strategic oil reserves. Scientific reports confirmed the feasibility of this proposal, but it was turned down.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{from the}} inland mines in {{southern}} County Durham {{was taken away}} on packhorses, and then horse and carts as the roads were improved. A canal was proposed by George Dixon in 1767 and again by John Rennie in 1815, but both schemes failed. Meanwhile, the port of Stockton-on-Tees, from which the Durham coal was transported onwards by sea, had invested considerably during the early 19th century in straightening the Tees {{in order to improve}} navigation on the river downstream of the town and was subsequently looking for <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> trade to recoup those costs.|$|E

5|$|Serbia's strongest {{exports to}} the United States include Fiat {{automobiles}} manufactured in Kragujevac. Fiat purchased Zastava Automobili in 2008 and subsequently managed the factory in Kragujevac {{so that it would}} produce new Fiat automobiles as opposed to Zastava models (the last Zastavas were produced in 2008); in May 2013 alone, 3,000 Fiat 500L units were shipped from Serbia to Baltimore for sale in the United States. The Fiat 500L is the first automobile to have been exported from Serbia to the United States since the Zastava Koral before 1992, and is proving to be a popular model with a large amount of advertising in the United States. Serbia is also the largest exporter of raspberries in the world (as of 2009), and much of the raspberries consumed in the United States are grown in Šumadija. In 2015, the two states discussed to find <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> investments in Serbia.|$|E
25|$|The first fMRI studies {{validated}} {{the technique}} against brain activity known, from other techniques, to be correlated to tasks. By the early 2000s, fMRI studies began to discover novel correlations. Still their technical disadvantages have spurred researchers to try more advanced <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> {{the power of}} both clinical and research studies.|$|E
25|$|Incrementally, Mitchell Energy found <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> production. Early on, Mitchell {{abandoned}} the foam frac, {{which had been}} used with some success in Appalachian Basin shales, and found that gel fracs worked better in the Barnett. In 1986, Mitchell Energy applied the first massive hydraulic frac, a gel frac, to the Barnett Shale.|$|E

25|$|To {{lower costs}} TTL chips were {{replaced}} with less expensive custom chips and <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> the yields {{on the sound}} and graphics chips were found.

25|$|When the French army {{occupied}} Tunisia, few Europeans were resident there, most {{being from}} Italy. The French government soon sought to discover <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> the French population. Various incentives, chiefly economic, {{began to be}} offered to citizens who would relocate to Tunisia. Since France itself enjoyed {{a higher standard of}} living, to be attractive the incentives to potential settlers had to be quite substantial when compared to Tunisian incomes.|$|E
25|$|Gilbreth {{discovered}} his vocation {{as a young}} building contractor when he sought ways to make bricklaying faster and easier. This grew into a collaboration with his wife, Lillian Moller Gilbreth, who studied the work habits of manufacturing and clerical employees {{in all sorts of}} industries to find <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> output and make their jobs easier. He and Lillian founded a management consulting firm, Gilbreth, Inc., focusing on such endeavors.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, the Wyandotte Nation {{continued}} to explore <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> revenues for the tribe, including redevelopment of the Huron Cemetery.

25|$|The Type 94 37mm AT {{guns were}} {{typically}} assigned {{in groups of}} four to combat infantry regiments. Each weapon was manned by a squad of 11 personnel, and was kept {{in contact with the}} regimental headquarters (typically up to 300 meters away) by field telephone or messenger runners. With the standard AP shell, it could penetrate 1.7 inches (43mm) of armor at 500 yards (460 meters). The Army Technical Bureau continued to experiment with <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> muzzle velocity through 1941.|$|E
25|$|The embargo had a {{negative}} influence on the US economy by causing immediate demands to address the threats to U.S.energy security. On an international level, the price increases changed competitive positions in many industries, such as automobiles. Macroeconomic problems consisted of both inflationary and deflationary impacts. The embargo left oilcompanies searching for new <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> oil supplies, even in rugged terrain such as the Arctic. Finding oil and developing new fields usually required five to tenyears before significant production.|$|E
25|$|The {{expense of}} Formula One {{has seen the}} FIA and the Formula One Commission attempt to create new {{regulations}} to lower the costs for a team {{to compete in the}} sport. Cost-saving proposals have included allowing customer cars, either by teams purchasing a car from another constructor, or the series supplying a basic chassis and engine to some teams at a low cost. Allowing teams to share more car components such as the monocoque and safety components is also under consideration. The FIA also continually researches new <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> safety in the sport, which includes introducing new regulations and accident procedures.|$|E

25|$|The {{life cycle}} {{considered}} usually {{consists of a}} number of stages including: materials extraction, processing and manufacturing, product use, and product disposal. If the most environmentally harmful of these stages can be determined, then impact on the environment can be efficiently reduced by focusing on making changes for that particular phase. For example, the most energy-intensive life phase of an airplane or car is during use due to fuel consumption. One of the most effective <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> fuel efficiency is to decrease vehicle weight, and thus, car and airplane manufacturers can decrease environmental impact in a significant way by replacing heavier materials with lighter ones such as aluminium or carbon fiber-reinforced elements. The reduction during the use phase should be more than enough to balance additional raw material or manufacturing cost.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the people who work on game development teams are men. Researchers have identified that one of the best <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> the percentage of female players comes from the aspect of authorship (either in-game as with Neopets and Whyville, or indirectly as with the Harry Potter series' inclusion of Hermione as a playable character subsequent to fan requests). The {{solution to the problem of}} societal pigeonholing of female gamers is often identified as interventionist work such as the insertion of women into the industry. Groups like WomenGamers.com and Sony's G.I.R.L. have sought to increase female gamer demographics by giving scholarships to girls considering getting into game development, and game developers like Check Six Games, Her Interactive, Silicon Sisters and Purple Moon have openly courted female coders and developers.|$|E
25|$|The Capacity Enhancement Program has a {{much larger}} scope and is {{considering}} more drastic <b>ways</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> runway capacity. On December 30, 2010, a 13-year $5.2 billion project that would have extended the two main runways and added one new runway {{was passed by the}} FAA. The project would also create two new passenger terminals, the first terminal will be built where the current terminal complex is located and the second terminal will be built across from the current terminal complex. The project was also going to relocate the UPS facility and redevelop cargo city, the cargo complex at PHL. The redesigned UPS facility would have required demolition of several houses of nearby Tinicum Township. But after much resistance by the residents of those homes, an agreement was made to keep the homes and expand the airport elsewhere. The new project will now cost $6.4 billion.|$|E
