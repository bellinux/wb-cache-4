500|$|Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide {{said that}} {{although}} [...] "30 Rock gave us yet another riff on what a <b>wild</b> <b>and</b> <b>crazy</b> guy Tracy Jordan is", the series was really finding its footing. Mitovich enjoyed the appearances of Dratch and Parnell, labeling the latter as {{the highlight of the}} episode. Robert Canning of IGN said that the episode [...] "failed to deliver the comic gold we were hoping for." [...] Canning had hoped that Tracy's storyline would be a [...] "subtle, fairly straightforward plot", in contrast to the wackiness the series had a reputation for, but found it unfunny. The reviewer did not enjoy the appearances of Dratch and Winters, and felt Conan O'Brien was not used to his full potential. Canning rated the episode 5 out of 10.|$|E
500|$|Just prior of {{the casting}} call and video shoot, Stansberry {{expressed}} his views to MTV News {{on the concept}} for the video – originality. [...] "Originality, being you. This song is about being who you want. It's about letting loose. There's no explanation. This is this underground video, this underground party." [...] During the video shoot, MTV interviewed Lopez about the concepts for the video. Lopez described some of the characters she played, telling MTV that in one scene [...] "I play one character where she kind of runs this party, acts like she's kind of over it, {{but at the same}} time loves it and loves this kind of underground kind of party dance culture,... So I got to be <b>wild</b> <b>and</b> <b>crazy,</b> and at the same time I got to be sexy and sweet too." [...] The video makes use of product placement, including BMW, Swarovski and Crown Royal, according to Tanner Stransky from Entertainment Weekly. Stransky also noted the [...] "unintentional placement" [...] of fake eyelashes and wigs, weaves, and other hair-extending products.|$|E
500|$|The Allman Brothers Band was {{released}} in November 1969 through Atco and Capricorn Records. Atco was a subsidiary label of Atlantic Records, and Walden had not even created a logo for Capricorn Records; instead, the LP featured an Atco label with a [...] "barely noticeable" [...] line reading [...] "Capricorn Records Series." [...] The record received a poor commercial response, selling fewer than 35,000 copies upon initial release. Executives suggested to Walden that he relocate the band to New York or Los Angeles to [...] "acclimate" [...] them to the industry. [...] "They wanted us to act [...] "like a rock band" [...] and we just told them to fuck themselves," [...] remembered Trucks. For their part, {{the members of the}} band remained optimistic, electing to stay in the South. [...] "Everyone told us we’d fall by the wayside down there," [...] said Gregg Allman, but the collaboration between the band and Capricorn Records [...] "transformed Macon from this sleepy little town into a very hip, <b>wild,</b> <b>and</b> <b>crazy</b> place filled with bikers and rockers." ...|$|E

500|$|The Allman Brothers Band {{formed in}} March 1969, and began writing music and touring together. By that August, {{the group had}} {{recorded}} their self-titled debut album, which was released that November on Capricorn Records, a division of Atlantic Records. The record received a poor commercial response, selling less than 35,000 copies upon initial release. Executives suggested to the band's manager and Capricorn president, Phil Walden, that he relocate the band to New York or Los Angeles to increase their exposure. [...] "They wanted us to act [...] "like a rock band" [...] and we just told them to [...] "fuck themselves," [...] remembered Trucks. For their part, {{the members of the}} band remained optimistic, electing to stay in the South. [...] "Everyone told us we'd fall by the wayside down there," [...] said Gregg Allman, but the collaboration between the band and Capricorn Records [...] "transformed Macon from this sleepy little town into a very hip, <b>wild,</b> <b>and</b> <b>crazy</b> place filled with bikers and rockers."

500|$|Andrew Orloff, the Creative Director and Visual Effects Supervisor of Zoic Studios, {{considered}} the creature {{one of the}} most challenging effects his company helped make for the season. He explained that this and other designed monsters are [...] "really super fantastical, they’re really out there, the anatomy and the biology of them is so <b>wild</b> <b>and</b> <b>crazy,</b> that it really takes a lot to make it look real in the scene and make it a part of the actors are reacting to these things – to get the audience to believe in it is kind of the biggest challenge we’ve faced on the show so far." [...] During filming, the cast and crew referred to the monster as a [...] "were-upine" [...] or [...] "porcuman". Lance Reddick commented on set, [...] "When I first got here tonight, I was expecting zombies to come up out of the ground. And the actual creature looks so bizarre, I mean it really looks like something I wouldn't want to be caught in the woods with." [...] The crew spent over a week collecting and placing the plane wreckage together. According to Set Dresser Russ Griffin, the set included approximately 15,000 pounds worth of plane parts.|$|E

The band rented a $165-a-month farmhouse on a lake outside of Macon, the busy comings and goings at which reminded them of New York City's Idlewild Airport. Idlewild South was the home of rehearsals and parties, and was [...] "where the brotherhood came to pass," [...] according to roadie Kim Payne; [...] "There was a pact made out there around a campfire—all for one and one for all ... Everybody believed [...] 100 percent." [...] Much of the material presented on the band's second album, Idlewild South, originated at the cabin. Oakley's wife rented a large Victorian home on 2321 Vineville Avenue in Macon and the band moved into what they dubbed [...] "the Big House" [...] in March 1970.|$|E

2500|$|Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune {{referred}} to Tré Cool as [...] "Green Day's most potent weapon", adding that [...] "His monstrous kick-drum wallop evokes John Bonham, while his manic fills make him punk's answer to Keith Moon."

Sound engineer Neill King, who worked with Green Day on Dookie, noted that Tré Cool shares Moon's [...] "wild animal approach" [...] to playing drums, and explained that the band encountered difficulties while recording [...] "Basket Case" [...] due to his unpredictable style: [...] "It's not that Tré wasn’t a good drummer, {{but in terms of}} his performances we wanted the best of the best...So, although we wanted him to do all of his <b>wild</b> fills <b>and</b> <b>crazy</b> drumming, we couldn’t just let him go.

In June 2014, two new flavors inspired by SNL sketches were introduced—Lazy Sunday, based on a sketch of the same name featuring Andy Samberg and Chris Parnell, and Gilly's Catastrophic Crunch based on the recurring Gilly sketches featuring Kristen Wiig.

6000|$|The last {{advantage}} of our hypothesis which need here be mentioned {{is that it}} helps to explain the DIFFUSION {{no less than the}} ORIGIN of the <b>wild</b> <b>and</b> <b>crazy</b> element in myth. We seek for the origin of the savage factor of myth in one aspect of the intellectual condition of savages. We say [...] "in one aspect" [...] expressly; to guard against the suggestion that the savage intellect has no aspect but this, and no saner ideas than those of myth. The DIFFUSION of stories practically identical in every quarter of the globe may be (provisionally) regarded {{as the result of the}} prevalence in every quarter, at one time or another, of similar mental habits and ideas. This explanation must not be pressed too hard nor too far. If we find all over the world a belief that men can change themselves and their neighbours into beasts, that belief will account for the appearance of metamorphosis in myth. If we find a belief that inanimate objects are really much on a level with man, the opinion will account for incidents of myth such as that in which the wooden figure-head of the Argo speaks with a human voice. Again, a widespread belief in the separability of the soul or the life from the body will account for the incident in nursery tales and myths of the [...] "giant who had no heart in his body," [...] but kept his heart and life elsewhere. An ancient identity of mental status and the working of similar mental forces at the attempt to explain the same phenomena will account, without any theory of borrowing, or transmission of myth, or of original unity of race, for the world-wide diffusion of many mythical conceptions.|$|E
