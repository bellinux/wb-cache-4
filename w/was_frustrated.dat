5|$|Waddy {{resigned}} {{his commission}} in 1974 and became Military Advisor to Westland Helicopters, a post he held {{until his retirement}} in 1989. Although he found the work stimulating, Waddy <b>was</b> <b>frustrated</b> by the Army's lack of interest in the helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Fan {{interest}} in women's wrestling sunk once {{again as the}} year closed, and Sing tired of working there. Moreover, Faye <b>was</b> <b>frustrated</b> with her gimmick. WWF management asked her not to perform the same power moves as the male wrestlers, so instead, Faye was forced to act as comic relief. After a year with the company, Sing asked for a release from her contract. She briefly returned to Japan, but {{did not like the}} new system, which did not guarantee payouts.|$|E

5|$|In March 1942, the Japanese {{military}} {{adopted a}} strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing Port Moresby in New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Samoa and New Caledonia. This plan <b>was</b> <b>frustrated</b> by the Japanese defeat in the Battle of the Coral Sea and was postponed indefinitely after the Battle of Midway. Following {{the defeat of the}} Japanese surface fleet, the IJN submarines were deployed to disrupt Allied supply lines by attacking shipping off the Australian east coast.|$|E
5|$|On arrival back in Australia, the AIF team played three {{first-class}} matches, {{defeating the}} reigning Sheffield Shield champions New South Wales and perennial Shield powerhouse Victoria. A likely victory against Queensland <b>was</b> <b>frustrated</b> due to torrential rain. The results in Australia demonstrated {{the strength of}} the AIF team and within a few months of the team's dissolution, Collins would make his Test début, along with his AIF team-mates, Gregory, wicket-keeper Bert Oldfield and the batsmen Johnny Taylor and Nip Pellew.|$|E
5|$|As the war progressed, this dissatisfaction {{increased}} {{and there were}} frequent changes to the cabinet. Toombs, who had wished to be president himself, <b>was</b> <b>frustrated</b> as an advisor and resigned {{within a few months}} of his appointment to join the army. Robert Hunter of Virginia replaced him as Secretary of State on July 25, 1861. On September 17, Walker resigned as Secretary of War due to a conflict with Davis, who had questioned his management of the War Department and had suggested he consider a different position. Walker requested, and was given, command of the troops in Alabama. Benjamin left the Attorney General position to replace him, and Thomas Bragg of North Carolina (brother of General Braxton Bragg) took Benjamin's place as Attorney General.|$|E

5|$|Despite Australian fears, the Japanese never {{intended}} to invade the Australian mainland. While an invasion was considered by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters in February 1942, it was judged to be beyond the Japanese military's capabilities and no planning or other preparations were undertaken. Instead, in March 1942 the Japanese military adopted a strategy of isolating Australia from the United States by capturing Port Moresby in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, Fiji, Samoa and New Caledonia. This plan <b>was</b> <b>frustrated</b> by the Japanese defeat in the Battle of the Coral Sea and was postponed indefinitely after the Battle of Midway. While these battles ended the threat to Australia, the Australian government continued to warn that an invasion was possible until mid-1943.|$|E
5|$|Despite his socialist and pro-Soviet beliefs, Crawford {{believed}} in collaborating with all foreign archaeologists, regardless of political or ideological differences. In early 1938, he lectured on aerial archaeology at the German Air Ministry; the Ministry published his lecture as Luftbild und Vorgeschichte, and Crawford <b>was</b> <b>frustrated</b> that the British {{government did not}} publish his work with the same enthusiasm. From there, he visited Vienna to meet with his friend, the archaeologist Oswald Menghin; Menghin took Crawford to an event celebrating the Anschluss, at which he met the prominent Nazi Josef Bürckel. Shortly after, he holidayed in Schleswig-Holstein, where German archaeologists took {{him to see the}} Danevirke.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, the Brundage-headed IOC, in {{a narrow}} vote, {{recognized}} both committees, thus allowing both states to participate at Melbourne. Only the PRC's committee initially accepted, but when the Taiwanese NOC changed its mind and decided to send a team to the Games, the mainlanders withdrew in protest. Brundage took the position that despite similar concerns about state sponsorship as with the USSR, once the PRC's committee was recognized and reported to the IOC that all eligibility rules were observed, the international committee had to accept that unless it had evidence to the contrary. He <b>was</b> <b>frustrated</b> by the continuing controversy, considering the squabble a distraction from the goal of advancing the Olympic movement.|$|E

5|$|In 1956, Mikan was the Republican {{candidate}} for the United States Congress in Minnesota's 3rd congressional district. He challenged incumbent Representative Roy Wier in a closely fought race that featured a high voter turnout. Despite the reelection of incumbent Republican President Dwight Eisenhower, the inexperienced Mikan lost by a close margin of 52% to 48%. Wier received 127,356 votes to Mikan's 117,716. Returning to the legal profession, Mikan <b>was</b> <b>frustrated,</b> after hoping for an influx of work. For six months, Mikan did not get any assignments at all, leaving him in financial difficulties that forced him {{to cash in on}} his life insurance.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev's U.S. visit {{resulted}} in an informal agreement with U.S. president Dwight Eisenhower {{that there would be}} no firm deadline over Berlin, but that there would be a four-power summit to try to resolve the issue, and the premier left the U.S. to general good feelings. Khrushchev returned from the U.S. convinced that he had achieved a strong personal relationship with Eisenhower (who in fact was unimpressed by the Soviet leader) and that he could achieve détente with the Americans. He pushed for an immediate summit, but <b>was</b> <b>frustrated</b> by French President Charles de Gaulle, who postponed it until 1960, a year in which Eisenhower was scheduled to pay a return visit to the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|McClellan {{resigned}} {{his commission}} January 16, 1857, and, capitalizing on {{his experience with}} railroad assessment, became chief engineer {{and vice president of}} the Illinois Central Railroad, and then president of the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad in 1860. He performed well in both jobs, expanding the Illinois Central toward New Orleans and helping the Ohio and Mississippi recover from the Panic of 1857. Despite his successes and lucrative salary ($10,000 per year), he <b>was</b> <b>frustrated</b> with civilian employment and continued to study classical military strategy assiduously. During the Utah War against the Mormons, he considered rejoining the Army. He also considered service as a filibuster in support of Benito Juárez in Mexico.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Success {{or failure}} of {{democracy}} are interpreted as different equilibria of a dynamic political game. Democracy <b>is</b> <b>frustrated</b> and fails when voters do not replace corrupt leaders, given some transition cost of changing leadership, and any new leader {{would be likely to}} govern corruptly. Even when new politicians have a small probability of being virtuous, democracy can <b>be</b> <b>frustrated</b> in a unitary political system. But in a federal system, democracy cannot <b>be</b> consistently <b>frustrated</b> at both national and provincial levels, because provincial leaders who govern responsibly could build reputations to become contenders for higher national office. Similarly, democracy cannot <b>be</b> consistently <b>frustrated</b> in a democratization process that begins with decentralized provincial democracy and only later introduces nationally elected leadership...|$|R
50|$|Where a law {{subsequent}} to contracting is passed, which renders the fundamental principle of contracting illegal, the contract {{will be found}} to <b>be</b> <b>frustrated.</b> There <b>are</b> several situations in which this may occur. Events such as war may render certain trading or actions illegal, {{as was the case}} in Denny, Mott & Dickinson v James Fraser and also see in Ertel Bieber and Co v Rio Tinto Co Ltd 1978 AC 260. If the law changes prohibit performance after the contract was made, the contract may <b>be</b> <b>frustrated.</b> Changes in the law may render building work illegal, or the use of certain materials illegal. A contract for the construction of a reservoir was held to <b>be</b> <b>frustrated</b> following wartime building regulations.|$|R

5|$|On 17July the American and British fleet {{attempted}} {{to strike the}} Yokosuka Naval Arsenal and other targets in the Tokyo area. While two waves of aircraft were dispatched, the attack <b>was</b> <b>frustrated</b> by heavy cloud over the region and further attacks were canceled. The aircraft which reached the Tokyo area struck airfields {{north of the city}} and caused little damage. While the naval base was not attacked, it was overflown by an American fighter and its defenders were readied to respond to attacks. On the night of 17–18July American and British warships bombarded the city of Hitachi.|$|E
5|$|Philip {{began the}} siege, but <b>was</b> <b>frustrated</b> {{in his attempt}} to take it, and the siege dragged on for nearly a year. During this time, there were two failed Athenian {{attempts}} to relieve the city. Philip was to lose an eye during the siege when he was hit by an arrow. Despite the injury inflicted on him by the defenders, he eventually agreed terms with the citizens of Methone, allowing them all to depart with one garment each. Buckler suggests that this lenient settlement may have been the result of the Thessalian request to intervene in the Sacred War (see below); anxious not to miss this opportunity, Philip sought to end the siege as quickly as possible.|$|E

Bhati was later recorded on video boasting about getting the officer suspended within 40 minutes. Other leaders of the Samajwadi party such as Azam Khan and Naresh Agarwal have issued statements supporting the suspension order.|$|E

5|$|The 8th {{and early}} 9th centuries were also {{dominated}} by controversy and religious division over Iconoclasm, {{which was the}} main political issue in the Empire for over a century. Icons (here meaning all forms of religious imagery) were banned by Leo and Constantine from around 730, leading to revolts by iconodules (supporters of icons) throughout the empire. After the efforts of empress Irene, the Second Council of Nicaea met in 787 and affirmed that icons could be venerated but not worshiped. Irene {{is said to have}} endeavoured to negotiate a marriage between herself and Charlemagne, but, according to Theophanes the Confessor, the scheme <b>was</b> <b>frustrated</b> by Aetios, one of her favourites.|$|E
5|$|With {{the arrival}} of fresh supplies, Hurdt and Amangkurat were emboldened {{to find ways to}} cross the river. Forces led by Dutch {{commander}} Isaac de Saint Martin drove Trunajaya's forces from Manukan, on the west bank further south from Singkal. They tried to cross the river there, but were unsuccessful due to heavy opposing fire and the depth of the water. They made another attempt on the night of 6–7 November, but their boats were sunk and it failed too. Hurdt <b>was</b> <b>frustrated</b> by the lack of progress, and gave Amangkurat an ultimatum that the VOC would withdraw unless the king supplied pontoons for the crossing, and matches for its soldiers's matchlocks.|$|E
5|$|As Bonds neared Aaron's record, Aaron {{was called}} on for {{his opinion of}} Bonds. He {{clarified}} {{that he was a}} fan and admirer of Bonds and avoided the controversy regarding whether the record should be denoted with an asterisk for Bonds's alleged steroid usage. He felt recognition and respect for the award was something to be determined by the fans. As the steroid controversy received greater media attention during the offseason before the 2005 season, Aaron expressed some reservations about the statements Bonds made on the issue. Aaron expressed that he felt drug and steroid use to boost athletic performance was inappropriate. Aaron <b>was</b> <b>frustrated</b> that the media could not focus on events that occurred in the field of play and wished drugs or gambling allegations such as those associated with Pete Rose could be emphasized less. In 2007, Aaron felt the whole steroid use issue was very controversial and decided that he would not attend any possible record-breaking games. Aaron congratulated Bonds through the media including a video played on the scoreboard when Bonds eventually broke Aaron's record in August 2007.|$|E
