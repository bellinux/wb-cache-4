The doctor <b>was</b> <b>astounded</b> that Dominguez was still playing football as X-rays and MRI scans revealed that he had three herniated disks and further complications in his spinal canal. The full extent of Domínguez's back problems, which saw him undergo two operations, was such that during his time with Gladbach he missed 88 of the 194 games the team played {{while he was at}} the club.|$|E
5|$|Hickok willed her {{personal}} papers to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in Hyde Park, {{part of the}} US National Archives. Her donation was contained in eighteen filing boxes that, according to the provisions of her will, were to be sealed until ten years after her death. In early May 1978, Doris Faber, as part of research for a projected short biography of Eleanor Roosevelt, became perhaps the first person outside the National Archives to open these boxes, and <b>was</b> <b>astounded</b> to discover that they contained 2,336 letters from Roosevelt to Hickok, and 1,024 letters from Hickok to Roosevelt. Most of them dated to the 1930s, but the correspondence continued up to Roosevelt's 1962 death. Hickok's papers remain at the FDR Library and Museum, where they are available to the public.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} young physicists, Rabi was closely {{following}} momentous events in Europe. He <b>was</b> <b>astounded</b> by the Stern–Gerlach experiment, which convinced {{him of the}} validity of quantum mechanics. With Ralph Kronig, Francis Bitter, Mark Zemansky and others, he set out to extend the Schrödinger equation to symmetric top molecules and find the energy states of such a mechanical system. The problem was that none of them could solve the resulting equation, a second-order partial differential equation. Rabi found the answer in a book by the 19th-century mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. The equation had the form of a hypergeometric equation to which Jacobi had found a solution. Kronig and Rabi wrote up their result and sent it to Physical Review, which published it in 1927.|$|E

5|$|Once Adrienne was {{released}} from prison in France, she, with the help of U.S. Minister to France James Monroe, obtained passports for her and her daughters from Connecticut, which had granted the entire Lafayette family citizenship. Her son Georges Washington had been smuggled out of France and taken to the United States. Adrienne and her two daughters journeyed to Vienna for an audience with Emperor Francis, who granted permission for the three women to live with Lafayette in captivity. Lafayette, who had endured harsh solitary confinement since his escape attempt a year before, <b>was</b> <b>astounded</b> when soldiers opened his prison door to usher in his wife and daughters on 15 October 1795.

5|$|While {{travelling}} {{on a train}} Abbe {{noticed an}} older man staring at him who then {{asked if he was}} a 5th Dan Judo. Abbe replied “Why yes, how did you know that?” “Because you have the build of a 5th Dan. So who are you?“ Kenshiro replied: “Everyone knows who I am, I am Kenshiro Abbe, Judo champion of all Japan! “ Yes, I can see that,“ the old man replied. The old man continued to talk to Kenshiro much to his annoyance as he wanted to get some sleep. Eventually, the old man put a finger in Kenshiro’s face, “You are so powerful, break my finger!” Kenshiro was only too happy to oblige. He took the finger, expecting to snap it like a twig, and wham! He found himself on the carriage floor under the full control of the old man. The old man allowed Kenshiro to get back into his seat. “Who are you?” Kenshiro Abbe asked. “I am Morihei Ueshiba, the founder of Aikido.” Kenshiro Abbe <b>was</b> <b>astounded</b> at the technique of the old man and requested that he become his student.|$|E

25|$|For his self-defence, Socrates first {{eliminates}} {{any claim}} {{that he is a}} wise man. He says that Chaerephon, reputed to be impetuous, went to the Oracle of Delphi and asked her, the Pythia, to tell him of anyone who was wiser than Socrates. The Pythia answered to Chaerephon that there was no man wiser. On learning of that oracular pronouncement, Socrates says he <b>was</b> <b>astounded,</b> because, on the one hand, it is against the nature of the Oracle to lie, but, on the other hand, he knew he was not wise. Therefore, Socrates sought to find someone wiser than himself, so that he could take that person as evidence to the Oracle at Delphi. Hence why Socrates minutely queried everyone who appeared to be a wise person. In that vein, he tested the minds of politicians, poets, and scholars, for wisdom; although he occasionally found genius, Socrates found no one who possessed wisdom; yet, each man was thought wise by the people, and each man thought himself wise; therefore, he (Socrates) was the better man, because he was aware that he was not wise.|$|E

However, Morgan and Wong were undecided about casting him for the part, so they requested him to perform again as they reviewed his previous works.

As {{they began to}} read, the duo noticed {{that it had a}} {{tendency}} to take [...] "readers on a lot of side trips"—"from detailed explanations of surveillance techniques to angry attacks on corrupt Swedish industrialists," [...] professed The Hollywood Reporter Gregg Kilday. Fincher recalled of the encounter: [...] "The ballistic, ripping-yarn thriller aspect of it is kind of a red herring in a weird way. It is the thing that throws Salander and Blomkvist together, but it is their relationship you keep coming back to. I was just wondering what 350 pages Zaillian would get rid of." [...] Because Zaillian was already cultivating the screenplay, the director avoided interfering. After a conversation, Fincher was comfortable [...] "they were headed in the same direction".|$|E

[...] Even though French filmmaker and professor Claude Lanzmann had mixed feelings about the book, he said: [...] "I am familiar with his subject, and above all I <b>was</b> <b>astounded</b> by the absolute accuracy of the novel. Everything is correct." [...] French historian Pierre Nora called it [...] "an extraordinary literary and historical phenomenon."

Tonelli named the foursome the [...] "Quietly Confident Quartet" [...] because they exhibited a reserved self-belief as they lined up for the race.

500|$|Hazlitt's {{treatment}} of The Merchant of Venice centres {{on the character}} of Shylock. A few years earlier, Edmund Kean had appeared as the Jewish moneylender in his debut performance at Drury Lane. Hazlitt, the drama critic for the Morning Chronicle in January 1814, sat close to the stage and watched every facial expression, every movement. He <b>was</b> <b>astounded</b> at Kean's, for the time, radically unconventional portrayal of Shylock as a full, rounded, complex human being, full of vigour, rather than a doddering, malevolent stereotype. His positive review of Kean's performance became critical in boosting the actor's career. But Kean's performance also helped alter Hazlitt's own view of Shylock, which made its way into this essay a few years later. Hazlitt admitted that he had tended to accept the older interpretation of Shylock's character as it had been depicted on stage, which followed centuries-old prejudices against the Jews, and made him a one-dimensional character. Kean's performance led him to study the play closely and think deeply about Shylock. Though Shylock's [...] "mind is warped with prejudices and passion [...] that he has but one idea, is not true; he has more ideas than any other person in the piece; and if he is intense and inveterate in the pursuit of his purpose, he shews the utmost elasticity, vigour, and presence of mind, in the means of attaining it".|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} year with Dorsey, Sinatra {{recorded}} over forty songs. Sinatra's first vocal hit was the song [...] "Polka Dots and Moonbeams" [...] in late April 1940. Two more chart appearances followed with [...] "Say It" [...] and [...] "Imagination", which was Sinatra's first top-10 hit. His fourth chart appearance was [...] "I'll Never Smile Again", topping the charts for twelve weeks beginning in mid-July. Other records with Tommy Dorsey issued by RCA Victor include [...] "Our Love Affair" [...] and [...] "Stardust" [...] in 1940; [...] "Oh! Look at Me Now", [...] "Dolores", [...] "Everything Happens to Me" [...] and [...] "This Love of Mine" [...] in 1941; [...] "Just as Though You Were There", [...] "Take Me" [...] and [...] "There Are Such Things" [...] in 1942; and [...] "It Started All Over Again", [...] "In the Blue of Evening" [...] and [...] "It's Always You" [...] in 1943. As his success and popularity grew, Sinatra pushed Dorsey {{to allow him to}} record some solo songs. Dorsey eventually relented, and on January 19, 1942, Sinatra recorded [...] "Night and Day", [...] "The Night We Called It a Day", [...] "The Song is You" [...] and [...] "Lamplighter's Serenade" [...] at a Bluebird recording session, with Axel Stordahl as arranger and conductor. Sinatra first heard the recordings at the Hollywood Palladium and Hollywood Plaza and <b>was</b> <b>astounded</b> at how good he sounded. Stordahl recalled: [...] "He just couldn't believe his ears. He was so excited, you almost believed he had never recorded before. I think this was a turning point in his career. I think he began to see what he might do on his own".|$|E
500|$|Dunn {{also claimed}} that Lodge put Diệm on hold {{in order to}} inform Conein where the Ngô {{brothers}} were so the generals could capture them. When confronted about Dunn's claim by a historian, Conein denied the account. It was also revealed that Conein had phoned the embassy early on the same morning to inquire about the generals' request for a plane to transport Diệm and Nhu out of Saigon. One of Lodge's staff told Conein that the plane {{would have to go}} directly to the faraway asylum-offering country, so that the brothers could not disembark at a nearby stopover country and stay there to foment a counter-coup. Conein was told that the nearest plane that was capable of such a long range flight was in Guam, and it would take 24 hours to make the necessary arrangements. Minh <b>was</b> <b>astounded</b> and told Conein that the generals could not hold Diệm for that period. Conein did not suspect a deliberate delay by the American embassy. In contrast, a US Senate investigative commission in the early 1970s raised a provocative thought: [...] "One wonders what became of the US military aircraft that had been dispatched to stand by for Lodge's departure, scheduled for the previous day." [...] The historian Mark Moyar suspected that Lodge could have flown Diệm to Clark Air Force Base in the Philippines, which was under American jurisdiction, before taking him to the final destination. Moyar speculated that [...] "when Lodge had offered the jet the day before, he had done it to induce Diệm to give up {{at a time when the}} outcome of the insurrection was very much in doubt. Now that the coup clearly had succeeded, Lodge no longer needed to offer such an incentive." ...|$|E
