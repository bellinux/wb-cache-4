The changes {{meant that the}} location manager and catering team were no longer required, studio shoots would be reduced from three cameras to two, and location shots will be mainly confined to the Ramsay Street and Lassiter's complex sets, with occasional filming in one-off places. Of the changes, FremantleMedia said [...] "Neighbours is undergoing a <b>work</b> <b>flow</b> upgrade to accommodate advances in technology and production techniques to ensure {{we are at the}} forefront of professionalism and efficiency." [...] They added that the show's production model had been in place since 1985 and {{that it was time to}} evolve it. On 14 March 2011, The Australian {{reported that}} Neighbours has become the first television show available to watch on a free iPhone application. Viewers are able to watch whole episodes within three hours of them airing on Eleven. Nick Spooner, the head of Ten digital media said [...] "This is part of what we call our 'three-screen approach' – broadcast, online and mobile – and it is intended to build viewer engagement with a show and our brand. This is a way for us to stay in touch with our audience and to keep them coming back." [...] To celebrate the wedding of Prince William of Wales and Kate Middleton, Neighbours filmed a specially commissioned scene for the UK episode airing on the same day as the wedding. The episode, which had already aired in Australia, marked the first time an Australian show recorded extra scenes for a UK broadcaster.|$|E

However, none of these products allow for composing and executing analysis <b>work</b> <b>flows</b> consisting of multiple process mining algorithms. As a result, the analyst needs to perform repetitive process mining tasks manually and scientific process experiments are extremely labor intensive. To this end, we have RapidMiner 5, which allows for the definition and execution of analysis <b>work</b> <b>flows,</b> connected with the process mining framework ProM 6. As such any discovery, conformance, or extension algorithm of ProM can be used within a RapidMiner analysis process thus supporting process mining <b>work</b> <b>flows...</b>|$|R

To avoid contamination {{and the risk}} of personnel exposure, the CDC advises investigators to follow best practices to reduce and control splatter and aerosol generation, such as keeping clean materials at least [...] from aerosol-generating activities and arranging the <b>work</b> <b>flow</b> [...] "from clean to contaminated". In particular, open flames, not necessary within the clean environment of a Class II or III BSC, cause disruption of the airflow inside. Once work inside a BSC has been completed, it is necessary to decontaminate the surfaces of the BSC as with other lab equipment and materials.|$|E

2500|$|CPOE {{presents}} {{several possible}} dangers by introducing {{new types of}} errors. Automation causes {{a false sense of}} security, a misconception that when technology suggests a course of action, errors are avoided. These factors contributed to an increased mortality rate in the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh's Pediatric ICU when a CPOE systems was introduced. In other settings, shortcut or default selections can override non-standard medication regimens for elderly or underweight patients, resulting in toxic doses. Frequent alerts and warnings can interrupt <b>work</b> <b>flow,</b> causing these messages [...] to be ignored or overridden due to alert fatigue. CPOE and automated drug dispensing was identified as a cause of error by 84% of over 500 health care facilities participating in a surveillance system by the United States Pharmacopoeia. Introducing CPOE to a complex medical environment requires ongoing changes in design to cope with unique patients and care settings, close supervision of overrides caused by automatic systems, and training, testing and re-training all users.|$|E

The analysis demonstrates potential insights to be gained by this approach, revealing clear patterns in the structure of travel to <b>work</b> <b>flows</b> between geodemographic clusters. Our broad approach is not limited to use in specific countries and has potential application for use with data from non-census sources...|$|R
