5|$|Edward's {{coronation}} {{had originally}} been scheduled for 26 June 1902. However, two days before, on 24 June, {{he was diagnosed with}} appendicitis. Appendicitis was generally not treated operatively and carried a high mortality rate, but developments in anaesthesia and antisepsis in the preceding 50 years made life-saving surgery possible. Sir Frederick Treves, with the support of Lord Lister, performed a then-radical operation of draining a pint of pus from the infected abscess through a small incision (through -inch thickness of belly fat and abdomen wall); this outcome showed thankfully that the cause was not cancer. The next day, Edward <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> in bed, smoking a cigar. Two weeks later, it was announced that the King was out of danger. Treves was honoured with a baronetcy (which Edward had arranged before the operation) and appendix surgery entered the medical mainstream. Edward was crowned at Westminster Abbey on 9 August 1902 by the 80-year-old Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple, who died only four months later.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} from SmackDown was the event's final match, in which Batista defended the World Heavyweight Championship against The Undertaker in a Hell in a Cell match. At one point, Batista {{performed}} a Batista Bomb through a table on Undertaker for a near-fall. The Undertaker then performed a Tombstone Piledriver on Batista for a near-fall. The Undertaker then performed another Tombstone Piledriver {{on top of}} the steel steps and pinned Batista, but as the referee counted the pin, Edge, dressed as a cameraman, pulled the referee out of the ring, and hit The Undertaker with the camera he was holding and then positioned Undertaker's head {{on top of the}} steel steps. Edge then slammed a folding chair onto The Undertaker's head. While the referee re-entered the ring, Edge dragged Batista onto The Undertaker, and as a result, Batista pinned The Undertaker to retain the World Heavyweight Title. After the match, Edge came back into the ring and hit The Undertaker with a chair as he <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
25|$|I {{remember}} somebody {{yelling and}} seeing a big {{ball of fire}} {{near the top of}} the tent. And this ball of fire just got bigger and bigger and bigger. By that time, everybody was panicking. The exit was blocked with the cages that the animals were brought in and out with. And there was a man taking kids and flinging them up and over that cage to get them out. I <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> in the bleachers and jumped down â€” I was three-quarters of the way up. You jump down and it was all straw underneath. There was a young man, a kid, and he had a pocketknife. And he slit the tent, took my arm and pulled me out.|$|E

60|$|Nibs had {{to knock}} twice {{before he got}} an answer, though Tink had really <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> in bed {{listening}} for some time.|$|R

25|$|Cassidy and I {{worked on}} Dillinger and Van Meter {{simultaneously}} on June 3. While {{the work was}} being done, Dillinger and Van Meter changed off. The work {{that could be done}} while the patient <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up,</b> that patient was in the sitting-room. The work that had to be done while the man was lying down, that patient was {{on the couch in the}} bedroom. They were changed back and forth according to the work to be done. The hands were sterilized, made aseptic with antiseptics, thoroughly washed with soap and water and used sterile gauze afterwards to keep them clean. Next, cutting instrument, knife was used to expose the lower skin...in other words, take off the epidermis and expose the derma, then alternately the acid and the alkaloid was applied as was necessary to produce the desired results.|$|E
500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of 7 October 1965, shortly after Smith's call, Superintendent Bob Talbot of the Cheshire Police arrived at the back door of 16Wardle Brook Avenue, wearing a {{borrowed}} baker's overall to cover his uniform. Talbot identified himself to Hindley as a police officer when she opened the door, and told her that he wanted to speak to her boyfriend. Hindley led him into the living room, where Brady <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> in a divan writing a note to his employer explaining {{that he would not be}} able to get into work because of his ankle injury. Talbot explained that he was investigating [...] "an act of violence involving guns" [...] that was reported to have taken place the previous evening. Hindley denied that there had been any violence, and allowed police to look around the house. When they came to the upstairs room in which Evans's body was stored the police found the door locked, and asked Brady for the key. Hindley claimed that the key was at work, but after the police offered to drive her to her employer's premises to retrieve it, Brady told her to hand the key over. When they returned to the living room, the police told Brady that they had discovered a trussed up body, and that he was being arrested on suspicion of murder. As Brady was getting dressed, he said [...] "Eddie and I had a row and the situation got out of hand." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prescott was {{diagnosed}} with diabetes in 1990, although this was not publicly disclosed until 2002. On 2 June 2007 he was admitted to hospital after being taken ill on a train from his constituency in Hull to London King's Cross. He was later diagnosed with pneumonia and was treated at University College Hospital, London. He was moved to a high-dependency ward on 5 June 2007 {{so he could be}} monitored more closely because of his age and the fact he suffers from diabetes. On 6 June 2007 it was reported in the media that his condition was stable and that he <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> and [...] "joking" [...] with hospital staff. He was subsequently released from hospital on 10 June 2007 to continue his recovery at home.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps so," [...] {{answered}} Maud. [...] "She <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> to-day, {{and seems}} brighter {{and more like}} herself. Have we decided, then, to return to America?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Only my back," [...] said Margaret. [...] "I have <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> {{longer than}} usual, {{and it is}} tired. Will you call nurse to lay me flat again?" ...|$|R
60|$|Summerlee <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> and {{stuffing}} some tobacco {{into his}} old briar.|$|E
60|$|She turned round quickly. He <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> in bed, and the sunbeam was {{traveling}} up toward him.|$|E
60|$|The {{prisoner}} <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up,</b> in {{a corner}} of the hut; a policeman, with drawn sword, standing near him.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{she is not}} in bed," [...] said Jane Ball. [...] "She <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up,</b> and has got all {{her things}} about the room {{as though she were}} packing." ...|$|R
6000|$|The mother glanced {{round at}} the bed, and said, glad to occupy herself delayingly with the minor care: [...] "Why, you have <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> all night! You will kill yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll find {{it tough}} enough {{by the time}} you're through. You must be in at the mine by {{daylight}} the day after to-morrow, anyway. Allonby will <b>be</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> waiting for you." ...|$|R

60|$|It was the Reverend William Tucker himself, who had recovered, and <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> on {{the floor}} looking rather confused.|$|E
60|$|The bishop {{looked up}} and saw Lady Ella's expression. Lady Ella <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> very stiffly, {{listening}} but not looking round.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You horrid old prosy {{thing of}} four U's,' said Geraldine. 'You <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> there, you great fair creature, you, {{for the poor}} child to worship and adore, and not {{reciprocating}} a bit!' ...|$|R
6000|$|A frog who had <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> {{all night}} in neighbourly {{converse}} with an echo of elegant leisure, {{went out in the}} grey of the morning to obtain a cheap breakfast. Seeing a tadpole approach, ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Give her {{something}} to eat, dear," [...] answered Rachel. [...] "Don't ask {{me any more}} questions now. We have <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> to our necks in water for hours, and are starved and frozen, {{to say nothing of}} worse things." ...|$|R
60|$|She then hastened away to her mother, who had {{purposely}} {{broken up}} the card party, and <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> stairs with Kitty.|$|E
60|$|But when Barbara again passed, the {{sleeping}} woman <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up,</b> and looked but a poor ordinary thing--her strange fragile beauty all withdrawn.|$|E
60|$|This was Peter Rabbit {{hitting the}} ground {{with one of his}} hind feet. He had stopped eating and <b>was</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> very straight.|$|E
6000|$|After all, she slept; {{and when}} she waked in the morning light, she looked up fixedly at her mother and said tenderly, [...] "Ah, poor mamma! You have <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> with me. Don't be unhappy. I shall live. I shall be better." ...|$|R
60|$|Except {{to relieve}} the sentries, there was no stir among them {{until late in the}} afternoon. Then there was a general movement, and soon all <b>were</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up,</b> and appeasing their {{appetite}} upon the cold meat and dampers they had brought with them.|$|R
6000|$|... "A husband!" [...] Anne had <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> in bed, {{the better}} to wrestle {{with the problem of}} her exact opinion of Billy Andrews. Now she fell flatly back on her pillows, the very breath gone out of her. [...] "Whose husband?" ...|$|R

60|$|Here little Caleb, who had <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> very straight, {{and looking}} eagerly at his {{grandmother}} {{and at the}} other boys, during {{the progress of the}} conversation, drew a long breath, and leaned back against the sofa, as if he felt a good deal relieved.|$|R
6000|$|... "You tell him," [...] said Michael, feeling, apparently, that he {{had done}} his share. [...] "My friend will tell you all about it," [...] he added to Gideon, with a yawn. [...] "Excuse my closing my eyes a moment; I've <b>been</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up</b> with a sick friend." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{the poor}} anxious wife <b>is</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>up,</b> and fondles the hand {{which has been}} shaken by so many illustrious men! The little feast dates back only {{eighteen}} years, and yet somehow it seems as distant as a dinner at Mr. Thrale's, or a meeting at Will's.|$|R
