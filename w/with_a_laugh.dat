25|$|Though some {{television}} series were already being filmed in Hollywood, most used the single-camera format familiar from movies, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh</b> track added to comedies to simulate audience response. Arnaz and I Love Lucy creator Jess Oppenheimer decided, however, that Lucy {{needed to work}} {{in front of an}} audience to create the kind of comic energy she had displayed on radio. The idea of a film studio that could accommodate an audience was a new one for the time, as fire safety regulations made it difficult to allow an audience in a studio. Arnaz and Oppenheimer were lucky enough to find the financially struggling General Service Studios located on Las Palmas Avenue in Hollywood. Studio owner Jimmy Nasser was eager to accommodate the Desilu company and allowed them, with financial backing of CBS, to renovate two of his studios so that they could accommodate an audience and be in compliance with local fire laws.|$|E
25|$|Her father, {{as well as}} his {{elder brother}} Timothy, and, still more, a son of the latter, had been {{accustomed}} to write in measured rhyme, their poems sometimes appearing in the local papers; and perhaps it was not strange that Harriett should, as soon as she could hold a pen, make crude attempts in the same direction. She was furnished with a copy book in which she wrote slowly and laboriously; and she soon turned surreptitiously {{to the back of the}} book and werote loose rhymes that were jingling in her brain. On one occasion, the teacher passed by her desk when she was just finishing a rhymed account of some event which had occurred in the school room. Something must have attracted the teacher's attention; for he noticed her book, grabbed it, and, after running it through by himself, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh,</b> he proceeded to read it aloud to the school. When class was over, she scurried home. Thought her father soothed her ruffled mood, her copy-book confidences were discontinued.|$|E
500|$|In {{his review}} of the film, Richard Roeper commended Jim Carrey for declining to reprise his role in [...] "three of the worst sequels of all time", which {{included}} , Son of the Mask and Evan Almighty. He continued: [...] "Evan Almighty is a paper-thin alleged comedy <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh</b> drought of biblical proportions, and a condescendingly simplistic spiritual message." ...|$|E

[...] Asked later whether Jon was killed or will survive, Martin responded <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh,</b> [...] "I will not comment on that." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1963, New York Times {{reviewer}} Lewis Funke {{said of the}} musical, [...] "Mr. Hammerstein put all of his {{big heart}} into the simple story of a British woman's adventures, heartaches, and triumphs.... A man with a world-view, he seized the opportunity provided by [...] to underscore his thoughts on the common destiny of humanity." [...] Fourteen years later, another Times reviewer, Clive Barnes, called the musical [...] "unsophisticated and untroubled. [...] Even its shadows are lightened <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh</b> or a sweetly sentimental tear... we can even be persuaded to take death as a happy ending".|$|E
500|$|Iðunn is {{introduced}} in the Prose Edda in section 26 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning. Here, Iðunn is described as Bragi's wife and keeper of an eski (a wooden box made of ash wood and often used for carrying personal possessions) within which she keeps apples. The apples are bitten into by the gods when they begin to grow old and they then become young again, which is described as occurring up until Ragnarök. Gangleri (described as King Gylfi in disguise) states {{that it seems to}} him that the gods depend greatly upon Iðunn's good faith and care. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh,</b> High responds that misfortune once came close, that he could tell Gangleri about it, but first he must hear the names of more of the Æsir, and he continues providing information about gods.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} criticised {{for the use}} of some [...] "sexist dialogues" [...] in the first half which were playing to a certain [...] "new generation" [...] audience. Sowmya Rajendran of Sify criticised the same and stated about one of such scenes in the film, [...] "it is such banter, which we often dismiss <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh,</b> that helps {{perpetuate}} rape culture." [...] When asked about this, the director replied, [...] "I firmly believe such conversations are part of our lives. I don't want to elaborate, but it also throws an insight into each character featured in the sequences. Yes, frankly, I was a bit worried how the family audience would react to those scenes. But then I read out that part of the script to a select group of women and they nodded their heads in approval." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Angel" [...] begins <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh</b> and an echo, panning {{from left}} to the right. The song is built on an {{ascending}} hook consisting of three chord sequence, which serves for the verse and chorus. It consists of a constant 8th rhythm throughout the song, making it sound similar to the songs of the band Machine. Vocal harmonies are also added beneath the main chorus. It is a two-bar phrase song, and laughter is again added as the song slowly fades out. Madonna sings in her lower register at the beginning, and shifts to the higher one in the line [...] "I {{can see it in}} your e-e-e-eyye-e-s". The line was taken from the song [...] "Death Disco" [...] (1979), by the British musical group Public Image Ltd. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, by Alfred Publishing, the song is set in the time signature of common time, with a medium tempo of 133 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of G major, with Madonna's voice spanning from the high-note of G3 to the low-note of B4. The song has a basic sequence of Am–Bm–C as its chord progression. The lyrics continuously repeat the angel-like image of Madonna's saviour.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} lukewarm reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, Species {{holds an}} approval of 34% based on 35 reviews. Roger Ebert gave it 2 out of 4 stars, criticizing the film's plot and overall lack of intelligence. Cristine James from Boxoffice magazine gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, describing it as Alien' meets 'V' meets 'Splash' meets 'Playboy's Erotic Fantasies: Forbidden Liaisons,' diluted into a diffuse, misdirected bore." [...] James Berardinelli gave the film 2½ out of 4 stars, stating that [...] "as {{long as you}} don't stop to think about what's going on, Species is capable of offering its share of cheap thrills, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh</b> or two thrown in as well." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly found the film lacking in imagination and special effects, also commenting that Alfred Molina [...] "sport a haircut that's scarier than the creature." [...] Varietys review of the film {{described it as a}} [...] "gripping if not overly original account of an extraterrestrial species attempting to overwhelm our own" [...] and that Ben Kingsley and other lead actors [...] "have only two-dimensional roles to engage them". The review mentions the similarity between H.R. Giger's design of Sil and his work on Alien.|$|E

500|$|... {{wrote the}} {{developing}} romance between Daniel and Vala in [...] "Unending" [...] {{by having them}} have sex without a confrontation. Claudia Black and Michael Shanks protested against this intended story, as Shanks felt that [...] "here's always been this underlining, keeping [...] at arms length because {{of the fear of}} getting too close." [...] Cooper rewrote the scene to show Vala's vulnerability to Daniel, and have Daniel share his true feelings of a relationship. The actors decided to play the confrontation scene as genuinely as possible, with both characters being neither completely in-character nor totally out-of-character. The scene was rehearsed a lot and was filmed over the course of six hours. Cooper was nevertheless concerned that Daniel appeared too edgy and mean, although his feelings were motivated by the two years of torment with Vala, and losing his wife nearly ten years before. Daniel's line, [...] "You better not be messing with me", was only said in one take by Michael Shanks. Since Cooper prefers to follow up on such emotional scenes <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh,</b> the immediate next scene shows Vala coming out of Daniel's room, where she encounters a disbelieving Mitchell jogging by. In Cooper's mind, Daniel held a crying Vala in another scene because she had gotten pregnant and had lost the baby. To contrast the obvious relationship between Daniel and Vala, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge subtly played their scenes as if their characters also had a romantic relationship.|$|E
2500|$|In recent years, Haruki Murakami {{has often}} been {{mentioned}} as a possible recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature. Nonetheless, since all nomination records are sealed for 50 years from the awarding of the prize, it is pure speculation. When asked {{about the possibility of}} being awarded the Nobel Prize, Murakami responded <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh</b> saying [...] "No, I don't want prizes. That means you're finished." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Stooges {{also tried}} their hand at another weekly {{television}} series in 1960 titled The Three Stooges Scrapbook, filmed {{in color and}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh</b> track. The first episode, [...] "Home Cooking", featured the boys rehearsing for a new television show. Like Jerks of All Trades in 1949, the pilot did not sell. However, Norman Maurer was able to reuse the footage (reprocessed in black and white) for the first ten minutes of The Three Stooges in Orbit.|$|E
50|$|Officer and Laughing Girl, {{also known}} as Officer and <b>a</b> <b>Laughing</b> Girl, Officer <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>Laughing</b> Girl or De Soldaat en het Lachende Meisje, was painted by the Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer between 1655 and 1660.

2500|$|In October 2010, Albarn {{announced}} to the media {{that he would not}} let the cast of Glee cover the band's songs, claiming that the music on the Fox network's TV show is a [...] "very poor substitute for the real thing". This statement led most people to believe that Gorillaz had been asked by Glee producers to lend their music to the show, which they had not. Albarn responded to the confusion <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh</b> and said [...] "and now they definitely won't." ...|$|E
2500|$|That same day, Wurzelbacher also {{appeared}} on Good Morning America. Diane Sawyer {{asked him if}} he was taking home $250,000 now, Wurzelbacher said <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh</b> [...] "No, not even close." [...] Sawyer asked Wurzelbacher, [...] "And the McCain camp, some people have said did they contact you and tell you {{that you were going to}} be a major part of this, and had they contacted you before that encounter with Senator Obama?" [...] Wurzelbacher answered, [...] "Oh no, no, no one's contacted me as far as if I was going to be on the debate or as far as my name being used. No. I have been contacted by them and asked to show up at a rally. But, other than that, no. I just happened to be here and Barack Obama happened to show up." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pasternak's {{fortunes}} {{were soon}} to change, however. In March 1956, the Italian Communist Party sent a journalist, Sergio d'Angelo, {{to work in}} the Soviet Union, and his status as a journalist as well as his membership in the Italian Communist Party allowed him to have access to various aspects of the cultural life in Moscow at the time. A Milan publisher, the communist Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, had also given him a commission to find new works of Soviet literature that would be appealing to Western audiences, and upon learning of Doctor Zhivagos existence, d'Angelo travelled immediately to Peredelkino and offered to submit Pasternak's novel to Feltrinelli's company for publication. At first Pasternak was stunned. Then he brought the manuscript from his study and told d'Angelo <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh,</b> [...] "You are hereby invited to watch me face the firing squad." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the season's final episode, Roseanne {{reveals the}} entire series itself is {{actually}} a story written by Roseanne Conner about her life. To cope, Roseanne twisted major elements of her life for the story, which the audience does not discover until the final moments of the series. In reality, Dan's heart attack {{near the end of}} Season 8 was fatal and the Conner family did not win the lottery. [...] A story arc which runs through the final season, was that Dan betrayed Roseanne by having an affair. [...] We learn that Dan's betrayal wasn't by having an affair, but by dying. [...] Tough Roseanne, who could always take the worst life could throw at her <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>laugh,</b> could not handle Dan's death. [...] Also, Jackie is a lesbian and Beverly is straight. Scott is a probate lawyer that Roseanne befriended, and set up with Leon—who she claims isn't very hip like she wrote him to be. Another difference is that Mark and Darlene were a couple all along, as were David and Becky, rather than the opposite (Becky with Mark and Darlene with David).|$|E
