5|$|Like many zoo animals, hippos were {{traditionally}} {{displayed in}} concrete exhibits. In {{the case of}} hippos, they usually had {{a pool of water}} and patch of grass. In the 1980s, zoo exhibits increasingly reflected native habitats. The Toledo Zoo Hippoquarium, features a 360,000 gallon pool. In 1987, the Toledo Zoo saw the first underwater birth by a captive hippo. The exhibit <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>popular,</b> the hippos became the logo of the Toledo Zoo.|$|E
5|$|After {{planting}} the vineyards and vinting wines, Romito opened the Mount Hope Estate and Winery in 1980. To promote his new business the first year, Romito hosted several events including an art show, a bluegrass concert, a fifties revival, a country-western weekend, a classical orchestra concert, and a one-day modern jousting tournament. The jousting tournament <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>popular</b> that Romito held a two-day renaissance festival {{the following year}} in the winery's parking lot, and gradually expanded this into a permanent attraction, the Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire. The property was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, and in 1991 the boundaries were increased {{as part of the}} Iron and Steel Resources of Pennsylvania Multiple Property Submission (MPS).|$|E

5|$|Gruban {{successfully}} appealed {{against his}} internment, {{and as soon}} as he was freed brought Booth to court. The case <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>popular</b> that the involved barristers found it physically difficult to get into the court each day due to the size of the crowds gathered outside. Although the barristers on both sides were noted for their skill the case went almost entirely one way, with the jury taking only ten minutes to find Booth guilty. This was one of the first noted cases of Patrick Hastings, and his victory in it led to him applying to become a King's Counsel.|$|E

5|$|On {{his return}} to Samarra, Abu Ahmad was {{initially}} received with honour by the Caliph, but soon he was thrown into prison as a potential rival, along with another of his brothers, al-Mu'ayyad. The latter was soon executed, but Abu Ahmad survived thanks {{to the protection of}} the Turkish military. Eventually, he was released and exiled to Basra before being allowed to return to Baghdad. He <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>popular</b> there {{that at the time of}} al-Mu'tazz's death, there was popular agitation in the city in favour of his elevation to Caliph. Instead, al-Muhtadi (r. 869–870) was chosen.|$|E
5|$|The {{pamphlet}} contained woodblock illustrations and {{was printed}} without attribution to Gray, at his request. Immediately after, Owen's magazine with Gray's poem was printed but contained multiple errors and other problems. In a 20 February letter to Walpole, Gray {{thanked him for}} intervening and helping to get a quality version of the poem published before Owen. It <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>popular</b> that it was reprinted twelve times and reproduced in many different periodicals until 1765, including in Gray's Six Poems (1753), in his Odes (1757), and in Volume IV of Dodsley's 1755 compilation of poetry. The revised version of 1768 was that later printed.|$|E
5|$|Etymologiae was {{the most}} used {{textbook}} throughout the Middle Ages. It <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>popular</b> that it was read in place {{of many of the}} original classical texts that it summarized, so these ceased to be copied and were lost. It was cited by Dante Alighieri, who placed Isidore in his Paradiso, quoted by Geoffrey Chaucer, and mentioned by the poets Bocaccio, Petrarch and John Gower. Among the thousand-odd surviving manuscript copies is the 13th-century Codex Gigas; the earliest surviving manuscript, the Codex Sangallensis, preserves books XI to XX from the 9th century. Etymologiae was printed in at least ten editions between 1472 and 1530, after which its importance faded in the Renaissance. The first scholarly edition was printed in Madrid in 1599; the first modern critical edition was edited by Wallace Lindsay in 1911.|$|E

5|$|Music {{from the}} opera became {{the subject of}} {{numerous}} virtuoso works of the time. The brilliant transcription of its themes (Reminiscences de Robert le diable) made by the composer and virtuoso Franz Liszt <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>popular</b> that it became his calling card: {{on more than one occasion}} he was forced to interrupt his programmed concerts to play it because of the demands of the audience. On the day of its publication by Maurice Schlesinger, the edition of 500 was completely sold out and it had to be immediately reprinted. Indeed, the success of Robert, whose score was also published by Schlesinger, was said to have saved him from bankruptcy. Frédéric Chopin and Auguste Franchomme jointly composed a Grand duo concertant on themes from the opera, for cello and piano, in 1832, and the Italian pianist and composer Adolfo Fumagalli composed an elaborate fantasy on the opera for left hand alone as his Op. 106.|$|E
5|$|The St. Joseph Valley {{was long}} {{occupied}} by Native Americans. One {{of the earliest}} known groups to occupy what would later become northern Indiana was the Miami tribe. Later, the Potawatomi moved into the region, utilizing the rich food and natural resources found along the river. The Potawatomi occupied this region of Indiana until {{most of them were}} forcibly removed in the 1840s. The South Bend area <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>popular</b> because its portage was the shortest overland route from the St. Joseph River to the Kankakee River. This route was used for centuries, first by the Native Americans, then by French explorers, missionaries and traders. The French explorer René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle, the first white European to set foot in what is now South Bend, used this portage between the St. Joseph River and the Kankakee River in December 1679.|$|E

After airing thirteen episodes and reaching an audience of 15 million viewers {{by the end of}} the show's first week on the air, the program expanded to an hour-long format when it returned in November. The series, of which episodes were originally shown only a day after their initial taping, was promoted to regular status on January 18, 2000 and, at the height of its popularity, was airing on ABC five nights a week. The show <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>popular</b> during its original primetime run that rival networks created or re-incarnated game shows of their own (e.g., Greed, Twenty One, etc.), as well as importing various game shows of British and Australian origin to America (such as Winning Lines, Weakest Link, and It's Your Chance of a Lifetime).|$|E

5|$|The site <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>popular</b> that in 1999 the East Sussex {{county council}} made {{an appeal to}} Disney as the old wooden bridge had been worn down by an {{overwhelming}} number of visitors. The company provided a substantial donation towards the estimated £30,000 needed to replace the bridge. Partly rebuilt in 1979, the donations from Disney, building firms {{and members of the}} public funded its complete reconstruction. The newly built and modernised bridge retained its precursor's original style. A plaque was also placed to commemorate the occasion and thank those who financially contributed to the project. The sport can still be played in Ashdown Forest to this day and the site regularly attracts tourists from as far afield as the United States and Japan. However, visitors are now advised to bring their own sticks, as previous visitors have caused damage to the trees in the vicinity.|$|E
5|$|The {{two months}} {{following}} the verdict were ones of great activity {{between the two parties}} and the citizens of Paris. As judicial duels were now so rare, no established battleground had been set aside, and a jousting arena at the Abbey of Saint-Martin-des-Champs north of the city agreed to host the combat. Both Carrouges and Le Gris endured bouts of illness in the weeks following the verdict but recovered with the aid of their families and supporters, who had joined the hundreds of people flocking to the city from nearby regions to witness the fight. Indeed, the event <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>popular</b> that when King Charles VI believed that his return to Paris in time for the combat would be held up in Flanders due to bad roads, he sent a fast messenger to Paris delaying the duel by a month in order that he would be present to witness it. This Royal intervention set the date for the combat back to 29 December 1386.|$|E
5|$|Dunn {{trained and}} showed Tennessee Walking Horses for 50 years, and {{during his career}} won two World Grand Championships and 20 World Championships with various horses, {{competing}} in 125 to 150 horse shows a year. Dunn participated in the breed's major annual horse show, the Tennessee Walking Horse National Celebration, nearly every year from 1950.

In total, Dunn personally showed 108 horses at the Celebration, and several hundred others which he trained were shown by other riders. Among them was Sundust Royal Flush, a stallion who, at the 1970 Celebration, won both the Preliminary Stallion class and the Three-Year-Old World Championship. Among other winning horses were Stock Exchange, who won the Junior Stallion Championship at the Dixie Jubilee in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 1984, and Yankee Delight, who won the Grand Championship at the same show. Dunn rode both horses to their wins. Among horses that were trained by Dunn but ridden by amateur riders, Delight Puff and Stuff was Amateur Champion, and Aces Executive was Ladies' Champion, also in 1984.|$|E
