His 1968 single, [...] "How You Gonna Get Respect (<b>When</b> <b>You</b> Haven't <b>Cut</b> Your Process Yet)", was his biggest post-Midnighters hit, peaking at number 15 on the R&B chart. James Brown produced Ballard's 1969 album You Can't Keep a Good Man Down. A 1972 single, [...] "From the Love Side", credited to Hank Ballard and the Midnight Lighters, went to number 43 on the R&B chart. Ballard also appeared on Brown's 1972 album Get on the Good Foot, in a track ("Recitation By Hank Ballard") that features Ballard describing Brown and the album.|$|R

When we hear of Churches such as these, as is not kept up by the people who uses them,--just as the theatres are, Mr. Finn, or the gin shops,--then I know there's a deal more to be done before honest men can come by their own.

I wanted Mrs. Churchley to break it to father, to intercede for me and help him to meet it. She was awfully kind to me, she listened and she understood; she could fancy how it had happened. Without her I shouldn't have pulled through. She liked me, you know," [...] he further explained, and as if it were quite worth mentioning--all the more that it was {{pleasant}} to him. [...] "She said she'd do what she could for me. She was full of sympathy and resource. I really leaned on her. But <b>when</b> <b>YOU</b> <b>cut</b> in of course it spoiled everything.

60|$|But {{really there}} is no knowing what the modern Quakers are, or believe, {{excepting}} this--that they are altogether degenerated from their ancestors of the seventeenth century. I should call modern Quakerism, so far as I know it as a scheme of faith, a Socinian Calvinism. Penn himself was a Sabellian, and seems to have disbelieved even the historical fact of {{the life and death}} of Jesus;--most certainly Jesus of Nazareth was not Penn's Christ, if he had any. It is amusing to see the modern Quakers appealing now to history for a confirmation of their tenets and discipline--and by so doing, in effect abandoning the strong hold of their founders. As an imperium in imperio, I think the original Quakerism a conception worthy of Lycurgus. Modern Quakerism is like one of those gigantic trees which are seen in the forests of North America,--apparently flourishing, and preserving all its greatest stretch and spread of branches; but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> through an enormously thick and gnarled bark, you find the whole inside hollow and rotten. Modern Quakerism, like such a tree, stands upright by help of its inveterate bark alone. Bark a Quaker, and he is a poor creature.|$|E

5000|$|The {{novel is}} written in a first-person narrative, and Ellory uses {{descriptive}} prose extensively.

60|$|It is {{a marked}} {{characteristic}} of the cactus tribe to be very tenacious of life, and when hacked to pieces, to spring afresh in full vigour from every scrap or fragment. True vegetable hydras, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>cut</b> down one, ten spring in its place: every separate morsel of the thick and succulent stem has the power of growing anew into a separate cactus. Surprising as this peculiarity seems at first sight, {{it is only a}} special desert modification of a faculty possessed in a less degree by almost all plants and by many animals. If you cut off the end of a rose branch and stick it in the ground under suitable conditions, it grows into a rose tree. If you take cuttings of scarlet geraniums or common verbenas, and pot them in moist soil, they bud out apace into new plants like their parents. Certain special types can even be propagated from fragments of the leaf; for example, there is a particularly vivacious begonia off which you may snap a corner of one blade, and hang it up by a string from a peg or the ceiling, when, hi, presto! little begonia plants begin to bud out incontinently on every side from its edges. A certain German professor went even further than that; he chopped up a liverwort very fine into vegetable mincemeat, which he then spread thin over a saucerful of moist sand, and lo! in a few days the whole surface of the mess was covered with a perfect forest of sprouting little liverworts. Roughly speaking, one may say that every fragment of every organism has in it the power to rebuild in its entirety another organism like the one of which it once formed a component element.|$|E

50|$|You are by {{no means}} a first offender. Your first brush with the law was on 27 April 1976, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{received}} five <b>cuts</b> following a conviction for theft. Since then you have been convicted of various other offences and your history shows a singular lack of discipline. You have become a liability to society. You committed the present offence whilst the suspended sentence, dated 20 February 1979, was hanging over your head. Your counsel has explained the nature of the crimen injuria offence and the court will accept what he said, namely that there was no physical involvement in that incident and that what had happened is that you had sworn at a woman which led to that conviction and sentence.|$|R

50|$|<b>When</b> <b>you</b> are {{exploring}} islands and dig for treasure, your energy meter will decrease. For example, you lose 5 energy {{every time you}} dig a ground; you lose 10 energy <b>when</b> <b>you</b> mine a rock, and you lose 7 energy <b>when</b> <b>you</b> dig <b>cut</b> a plant or a tree. You can refill your energy meter by waiting for 5 minutes which is equivalent to 1 energy level; or by consuming fruits which you can get by either as gifts from friends or rewards while digging, after which you will gain 1 energy point. You can send fruits as gifts to your neighbors, and most likely, you can receive one as well. Each fruits available as gifts have corresponding energy level: pineapple has the biggest amount which gives off 25 energy; coconut has 20; mango has 15; banana has 10; and kiwi has 5.You can also grow your own fruit, which takes a varied amount of time (from 1 hour to 1 day). Another way to get energy is by asking your friends for an energy pack which will refill your energy meter. The request for energy pack is available daily. Or you may opt to purchase this energy pack from the store for 10 island cash. Moreover, you can level up easily by completely digging an island as it rewards additional points. Each {{increase on the level}} gains one additional energy in your total energy meter. Additionally, you can also get 1 energy added in your energy and energy meter each time you use an Energy Capsule.|$|R
