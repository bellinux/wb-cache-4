5|$|The {{first section}} of roadway to receive the M-109 {{designation}} <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> and signed on maps by May 1, 1929. The roadway was a spur from M-22 north of Empire that ended at Glen Haven, {{just west of the}} D.H. Day State Park. The highway was extended east along an existing road between Glen Haven and Glen Arbor. This extension <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> by May 1, 1933, completing the modern routing of M-109. The highway was fully paved in 1939.|$|E
5|$|As well as rugby sevens, {{baseball}} and softball, which were {{dropped from the}} Olympic programme in 2005, karate, squash, golf and roller sports (inline speed skating) were all seeking {{to be included in}} the 2016 games and leaders of the seven sports made formal presentations to the IOC executive board in June 2009. A new system <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> at this session in which a sport now needs only a simple majority rather than the two-thirds majority that was required before.|$|E

5|$|At the {{completion}} of the regular season, the top four teams progressed to the postseason. It was contested over three weeks, following the Page playoff system. Each stage was decided by a best–of–three game series. Unlike regular season games, which made use of a variation of the International Baseball Federation's mercy rule after seveninnings, no such rule <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> for postseason games; all games went the full nineinnings, with the only exception being two games that were tied after nineinnings, therefore requiring extra innings.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the height}} of the ceiling and the inaccessibility of the ceiling frescoes, the precise nature of the damage and the {{problems}} that would be encountered by the restoration team could not be entirely foreseen until after the decision to restore was taken, and the scaffolding <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b> According to Colalucci, the continued scientific analysis and the response of the restorers to the particular problems was an ongoing part of the process, rather than the conservation team deciding on a single treatment for every part of the building.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the {{division}} <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> the battle lines on both sides had largely solidified, leaving the 45th Infantry Division in a stationary position as it conducted attacks and counterattacks for the same ground. The division was put {{under the command of}} Eighth Army's I Corps for most of the conflict. It was deployed around Chorwon and assigned to protect the key routes from that area into Seoul. The terrain was difficult and the weather was poor in the region. The division suffered its first casualty on 11 December 1951.|$|E

5|$|Goodison Park {{is unique}} {{in the sense that}} a church, St Luke's, {{protrudes}} into the site between the Goodison Road Stand and the Gwladys Street Stand only yards from the corner flag. Everton do not play early kick-offs on Sundays in order to permit Sunday services at the church. The church is synonymous with the football club and a wooden church structure <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> when Goodison Park was originally built. Former Everton players such as Brian Harris have had their funeral service held there.|$|E
5|$|In the balkline games, {{rather than}} drawing balklines {{a few inches}} from the corners, the entire table is divided into {{rectangular}} balk spaces, by drawing balklines a certain distance lengthwise and widthwise across the length of the table a set number of inches parallel out from each rail. This divides the table into eight rectangular balkspaces. Additionally, rectangles are drawn where each balkline meets a rail, called anchor spaces, which developed to stop a number of nursing techniques that exploited the fact that if the object balls straddled a balkline, no count limit <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
5|$|Machete {{turned out}} to be more of a success at the box office than Grindhouse, {{grossing}} $44 million internationally against a just-over $10 million budget. At the end of the film, the announcer says that there would be two sequels: Machete Kills and Machete Kills Again. Soon afterward, Rodriguez confirmed that the financing for the sequels <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> and that once everyone was free, they could begin shooting.|$|E

5|$|Naming and {{classifying}} our surroundings {{has probably}} been taking place as long as mankind {{has been able to}} communicate. It would always have been important to know the names of poisonous and edible plants and animals in order to communicate this information to other members of the family or group. Medicinal plant illustrations show up in Egyptian wall paintings from c. 1500 BC, indicating that the uses of different species were understood and that a basic taxonomy <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>place.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sellers {{can also}} do trade-ins {{in-person}} and get reimbursed immediately at partnered retailers like Target. The Target trade-in program {{began as a}} pilot project in 2009, and expanded to 190 locations by 2010 and almost 1,500 stores by 2011. A similar partnership <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> with Circuit City before it {{went out of business}} in 2009. A company spokesperson stated in 2009 that the company was also partnered with 15 smaller retailers for in-person trade-ins.|$|E
5|$|Stalin {{was aware}} that the Americans {{were working on the}} atomic bomb and, given that the Soviets' own rival program <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>place,</b> he reacted to the news calmly. The Soviet leader said he was pleased by the news and {{expressed}} the hope that the weapon would be used against Japan. One week {{after the end of the}} Potsdam Conference, the US bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Shortly after the attacks, Stalin protested to US officials when Truman offered the Soviets little real influence in occupied Japan.|$|E

5|$|The first {{designation}} of M-83 <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> by July 1, 1919, for a routing along the Mohawk–Gay Road between {{the communities of}} the same name in Keweenaw County in the Upper Peninsula. This designation lasted until late 1926 when it was replaced by a northerly extension of M-26. The second {{designation of}} M-83 replaced M-31 across The Thumb between Bay Port and Harbor Beach, along what is today M-142.|$|E
5|$|The prison {{walls were}} {{constructed}} beginning in 1853, {{and the site}} for the Main Cell Block was excavated and levelled. Once the walls were completed in 1855, the only opening was in the western side. This gap was where the gatehouse and associated entry complex was built in 1854 and 1855. The main gate <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> in 1855, while the London-made clock for the top of the structure was installed a year later. In 1856, a mini tornado toppled most of the northern boundary wall, and extensive work was undertaken to rebuild and widen the walls.|$|E
5|$|Urse also {{oversaw the}} {{construction}} of a new castle at the town of Worcester, although nothing now remains of the castle. Worcester Castle <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> by 1069, its outer bailey built on land that had previously been the cemetery for the monks of the Worcester cathedral chapter. The motte of the castle overlooked the river, just south of the cathedral. Although Urse had control of the castle after it was built, by 1088 he had lost it to the bishops of Worcester.|$|E

5|$|While {{the idea}} of {{national}} symbols was strange to the Japanese, the Meiji Government needed them {{to communicate with the}} outside world. This became especially important after the landing of U.S. Commodore Matthew Perry in Yokohama Bay. Further Meiji Government implementations gave more identifications to Japan, including the anthem Kimigayo and the imperial seal. In 1885, all previous laws not published in the Official Gazette of Japan were abolished. Because of this ruling by the new cabinet of Japan, the Hinomaru was the de facto national flag since no law <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> after the Meiji Restoration.|$|E
5|$|Amato (Bruce Willis) is an {{international}} arms dealer who the Federal Bureau of Investigation have been tracking, as they believe Amato is planning the sale of FIM-92 Stinger missiles stolen from a military arms depot. The FBI agrees to allow Metro-Dade to conduct the surveillance as its equipment <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> first. Crockett and Tubbs watch Amato's abusive relationship with his wife Rita (Katherine Borowitz). When Rita attempts to hire a hitman to kill Amato, Crockett intercepts the call and meets with her, arranging her help in their case in return for her safety. She explains that she has tried to leave Amato before, but he hired thugs to rape her divorce lawyer's wife to scare her into place.|$|E
5|$|Astronomy {{classes at}} the University of Illinois date to its {{earliest}} days. The first courses focused on measurement {{of the night sky}} and was taken by civil engineering students to sharpen their surveying skills. A small observatory consisting of a 4-inch refractor and a small transit telescope was constructed by 1872. The astronomy courses were typically taught by the mathematics department and by the early 1890s, several mathematics instructors wanted to do more with astronomy. An expanded astronomy curriculum would require a new larger facility. The Illinois state legislature voted in 1895 to fund a new teaching observatory at the University of Illinois, providing $15,000 for construction. The site chosen was a grass knoll between Matthews Avenue and Burrill Avenue, just north of the Morrow Plots, a National Historic Landmark that is the nation's oldest experimental field. Contracts were extended to Charles A. Gunn, the architect and an instructor on campus, and Bevis and Company in Urbana as the general contractor with construction beginning in April 1896. The building was completed by August at a total cost of $6,800. The principle telescope was installed in November and the final telescope <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>place</b> by February 1897.|$|E
