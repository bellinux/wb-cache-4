40|$|Flow {{patterns}} for horizontal intube flow boiling {{have been studied}} for the new refrigerants HP 80 and HP 62 and the conventional refrigerant R- 502. The flow pattern observations were compared with several criteria utilized in horizontal flow boiling correlations for determining whether the entire circumference of a horizontal evaporator tube is all wet or only partially <b>wet.</b> <b>Use</b> of only the liquid Froude number FrL (utilized by numerous flow boiling correlations) is shown to be completely unreliable. Stratified (partially wet wall) flow was found to occur at Froude numbers up to 16 times those of the recommended threshhold values utilized by the correlations. A semi- empirical method for predicting stratification proposed by Klimenko and Fyodorov is an improvement but is only patrially successful in predicting the present data...|$|E

30|$|In summary, the {{hierarchical}} architecture of CNTs/Si-μp has a superhydrophobic surface with large CA and ultralow SA of only 3 ° to 5 °. Tiny water droplets larger than 0.3 μL can slide on CNTs/Si-μp with a tilted angle of 5 °, showing a high capacity of collecting water droplets. After <b>wetting</b> <b>using</b> tiny water droplets, the CNT forest growing on planar Si wafer loses its superhydrophobic properties, but the CNTs/Si-μp {{still have a}} superhydrophobic surface because {{they still have a}} hierarchical structure. The CNTs/Si-μp show stable superhydrophobic properties.|$|R

Related phenomena for interface depinning from defect lines in the bulk are also considered. Comment: 4 pages, 1 figur...|$|R

40|$|Porous {{materials}} display interesting transport phenomena due to {{the restricted}} motion of fluids within the nano- to micro-scale voids. Here, we investigate how liquid wetting in highly ordered inverse opals is affected by anisotropy in pore geometry. We compare samples with different degrees of pore asphericity and find different wetting patterns depending on the pore shape. Highly anisotropic structures are infiltrated more easily than their isotropic counterparts. Further, the wetting of anisotropic inverse opals is directional, with liquids filling from the side more easily. This effect is supported by percolation simulations as well as direct observations of <b>wetting</b> <b>using</b> time-resolved optical microscopy...|$|R

Slow tensile tests with notched specimens revealed that in a temperature range close to the melting point of Pb, the steel is sensitive to LME (350 – 400 °C) and to Solid Metal Induced Embrittlement (SMIE) (300 °C).
