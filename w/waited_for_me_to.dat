60|$|He {{stopped and}} <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{join him in}} his infernal glee.|$|E
60|$|He shut up his notes, and, {{steadily}} {{watching my}} face, <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> speak first.|$|E
60|$|He <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{declare that}} I quite {{understood}} that he expressly said that he admitted nothing.|$|E
60|$|I suppose my face {{expressed}} my acceptance, for {{he did not}} <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> speak.|$|R
60|$|He propounded no scheme, but {{stood in}} an easy {{attitude}} of attention, <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> continue.|$|R
60|$|LILY. I can't, because Isey {{never goes}} to sleep, {{if she is}} <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come.|$|R
60|$|She <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> speak, {{and then}} irritated by my silence struck at me sharply with that wicked little tongue of hers.|$|E
60|$|He was all {{interested}} attention, and <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go on, though I {{could see in}} his eyes the certitude that my convictions had been shaken.|$|E
60|$|Guest leaned towards me. His {{eyes were}} bright and alert, and his manner was {{perfectly}} composed. He was more used to such crises than I was. He asked no question; he <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> speak.|$|E
60|$|I {{could hardly}} {{understand}} {{whether she was}} in jest or in earnest. She went on without <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> reply.|$|R
5000|$|Me esperas, a comer peras? : {{literally}} [...] "will you <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> eat pears?- [...] "Will you <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> me?" ...|$|R
60|$|Hans {{surveyed}} me with {{a watery}} eye as though <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> explain them, but I looked haughty and declined to oblige.|$|R
60|$|She <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> go on. She {{was deeply}} interested. I {{could hear her}} breath coming fast, though we were walking at a snail's pace. I longed to confide in her absolutely, but I dared not.|$|E
60|$|It {{would seem}} that in this {{farewell}} call I was permitting myself an exaggeration {{of what had been}} to Alice only a pleasant association, for she greeted me composedly and <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> justify my presence.|$|E
60|$|Isobel did not move, but {{she turned}} very pale. Her eyes seemed {{fastened}} upon mine. She <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> speak. The situation was embarrassing enough {{so far as}} I was concerned, for Lady Delahaye was obviously in earnest. I tried to gain time.|$|E
6000|$|... 'They {{want to hang}} me,' {{answered}} the young man; 'the gallows are all ready and the hangman is only <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> stop playing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The villain! why did not he <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{have the}} comfort of killing him? Dog!" [...] and he kicked the corpse with his foot.|$|R
6000|$|... "They're <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> lose strength!" [...] Jacob chuckled. [...] "I {{never felt}} so fit in my life. How high is it from this window?" ...|$|R
6000|$|The wretched girls still sat {{silent and}} obstinate, {{with their heads}} down. I tremble again as I write of what {{happened}} next. Papa fixed his eyes on me. He said, out loud: [...] "Eunice!"--and <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> rise and answer, as my sister had done.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was out {{attending}} a poor fellow {{who was shot}} through the lung, and that fool of a woman <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> come back instead of following me. I have brought you an orderly in place of her. By Jove, he has bled! I suppose the silk has slipped. Well, {{there is only one}} thing for it. Orderly, the chloroform." ...|$|E
60|$|It came open. Oh, yes, {{very much}} as usual. But in the {{ordinary}} course of events the first sight in the hall {{should have been the}} back of the ubiquitous, busy, silent maid hurrying off and already distant. But not at all! She actually <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> enter. I was extremely taken aback and I believe spoke to {{her for the first time}} in my life.|$|E
6000|$|... "We can't {{be worse}} off, so God help us," [...] said Emma, and without <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> lead her she swung herself over the edge.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. H. He's been <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> {{look at him}} {{all through}} dinner. Shall I do it, {{and you can see}} what an idiot he looks? ...|$|R
60|$|The news I got on {{reaching}} London was this: {{my mother}} did not understand that her daughter was dead, and they were <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> tell her.|$|R
6000|$|... 19. I dined with Lord Treasurer to-day, and {{sat with}} him till ten, {{in spite of my}} teeth, though my printer <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> correct a sheet. I told him of four lines I writ extempore with my pencil, on a bit of paper in his house, while he lay wounded. Some of the servants, I suppose, made waste-paper of them, and he never had heard of them. Shall I tell them you? They were inscribed to Mr. Harley's physician. Thus ...|$|E
60|$|I headed my {{train on}} Ladrone, {{who led the}} way with a fine stately tread, his deep brown eyes alight with intelligence, his {{sensitive}} ears attentive to every word. He had impressed me already by his learning and gentleness, but when one of my packhorses ran around him, entangling me in the lead rope, pulling me to the ground, the final test of his quality came. I expected to be kicked into shreds. But Ladrone stopped instantly, and looking down at me inquiringly, <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> scramble out from beneath his feet and drag the saddle up to its place.|$|E
60|$|That was why Nelson had lingered at the bar. Having {{bought a}} drink, he had <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> buy one. I HAD LET HIM BUY SIX DRINKS AND NEVER ONCE OFFERED TO TREAT. And {{he was the}} great Nelson! I could feel myself {{blushing}} with shame. I {{sat down on the}} stringer-piece of the wharf and buried my face in my hands. And the heat of my shame burned up my neck and into my cheeks and forehead. I have blushed many times in my life, but never have I experienced so terrible a blush as that one.|$|E
60|$|I {{saw that}} he was <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> say something; so I asked if his great work had not cost a vast {{expenditure}} of time and pains.|$|R
6000|$|He {{would have}} {{released}} her, but she lingered in his embrace. [...] "Will you promise that if there's ever {{anything like it}} again, you won't <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> make you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Howld yer jaw, you jabbering apes!" [...] he exclaimed, {{in great}} wrath. [...] "Give me a lantern, or a candle, {{and let me}} begone. The boys are all <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> begin." ...|$|R
60|$|The posada {{was merely}} a long barn, with an open roof of wood, {{on one side of}} which were half a dozen mangers and in a corner two mules. Against another wall were rough benches for {{travellers}} to sleep on. I dismounted and walked to the huge fireplace at one end, where I saw three very old women seated like witches round a brasero, the great brass dish of burning cinders. With true Spanish stolidity they did not rise as I approached, but <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> speak, looking at me indifferently. I asked whether I could have anything to eat.|$|E
6000|$|Old Mother Nature {{understood}} instantly. When she had said, [...] "Now there's Pekan the Fisher," [...] Prickly Porky {{had waited}} to hear no more. He had instantly {{thought that she}} meant that Pekan was right there somewhere. [...] "It's all right, Prickly Porky," [...] said she. Pekan isn't anywhere around here, so climb back on that stump and don't worry. Had you <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> finish, you would have saved yourself a fright. Chatterer had just said that you didn't have to fear anybody and I was starting to explain that he was wrong, that despite your thousand little spears you have reason to fear Pekan the Fisher." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'So spake the man, {{and long}} did that night seem to me, and before dawn I rose {{and put on}} my armour, and mounted my horse and rode on till I reached the grassy space {{of which he had}} told me. There was the black man on top of the mound, as he had said, and in truth he was mightier in all ways than I had thought him to be. As for the club, Kai, {{it would have been a}} burden for four of our warriors. He <b>waited</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> speak, and I asked him what power he held over the beasts that thronged so close about him.|$|E
60|$|She won the game, and I dealt. I misdealt, as {{was only}} natural, when I {{knew she was}} lying in <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do wrong; and she denounced <b>me</b> <b>for</b> a stupid, clumsy laboring-boy.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Gereth {{looked at}} her with a slight {{increase}} of hardness. [...] "You've done everything you need for modesty, my dear! If he's sick with love of you, you haven't had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> inform you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm pretty {{certain they}} will, sir," [...] the man declared. [...] "They sat about <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> be disengaged, {{but when my}} time off came, I hopped out the back way. They'll be there again to-night, sure enough." ...|$|R
