Introduction: The {{head of the}} American branch of the Hawthorne family, Ww. Hathorne of Wilton, Wiltshire, England, emigrated with Winthrope and arrived at Salem Bay, Mass. June 12, 1630. Nathaniel Hawthorne was born in Salem, Mass. July 4 th, 1804. His {{immediate}} ancestors were seafaring men, trading with the East Indies. A more remote progenitor was a judge and had been concerned in the trials of the witches in the 17 th Century. Others had commanded troops against the Indians. The race had the characteristics of Puritans and were held {{to be even more}} stern and conciliating than the average Puritan. The mother of Nathaniel Hawthorne was a <b>woman</b> <b>of</b> beauty, <b>dignity,</b> and unusual intellect. Nathaniel was left fatherless at the age of four. His education was under the superintendence of his maternal uncle, but he was not an assiduous student. He liked desultory reading and out-door play, hunting and skating. He was very fond of taking long walks alone and he often declared to his mother that he would sometime go to sea and never return. He had an arch love for mischief, a consciousness of power and a healthy independence of character. While a child he read Shakespeare, Milton, Pope and Thomson, the Castle of Indolence being an especial favorite...|$|R
40|$|The concept <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> plays a {{foundational}} role in {{the more}} recent versions of Martha Nussbaum's capabilities theory. However, despite its centrality to her theory, Nussbaum's conception <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> remains under-theorised. In this paper we critically examine the role that dignity plays in Nussbaum's theory by, first, developing {{an account of the}} concept <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> and introducing a distinction between two types <b>of</b> <b>dignity,</b> status dignity and achievement dignity. Next, drawing on this account, we analyse Nussbaum's conception <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> and contrast it with Kant's conception <b>of</b> <b>dignity.</b> On the basis of this comparison between Nussbaum and Kant, we highlight tensions between Nussbaum's Aristotelianism, which is central to her conception <b>of</b> <b>dignity,</b> and her commitment to political liberalism. This leads us to conclude that Nussbaum's claim that her conception <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> is only a partial political conception is implausible and that her conception <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> seems to commit her to a satisficing form of perfectionist liberalism. 18 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Background: Loss <b>of</b> {{personal}} <b>dignity</b> {{in patients}} with a serious and progressive disease is associated with psychological suffering and loss of the will to live. Preservation of a sense <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> in the seriously ill should therefore be a primary concern throughout the illness trajectory from diagnosis onward. However, there is currently limited insight into the dynamics of patients' sense <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> during the progression of illness. Aim: This longitudinal qualitative study investigates patients' experiences with dignity over time in a diverse patient population (cancer, early-stage dementia and severe chronic illnesses). Method: Nineteen patients were interviewed annually (max. 4 years), resulting in a data base of 56 interviews in total. Data were analyzed making use of thematic analysis. Results: Three different trajectories over time could be distinguished: (a) a Dynamic Equilibrium in which the individual's sense <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> was temporarily diminished followed by a return to previous levels; (b) a Downward Trend in which the sense <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> was diminished with progression of the disease without a return to previous levels; and (c) Stability in which the sense <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> remained unaltered despite changes in circumstances. Conclusion: While {{there is a small}} group of patients for whom dignity remains unaffected by their disease experiences, most patients go through difficult times during which they struggle to maintain or regain their sense <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> in the face of progressive loss.

Our aim was to identify the extent to which dying patients perceive they are able to maintain a sense <b>of</b> <b>dignity,</b> and to ascertain how demographic and disease-specific variables relate to the issue <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> in these individuals. We did a cross-sectional study of a cohort of terminally ill patients with cancer, who had a life expectancy of less than 6 months. We enrolled 213 patients from two palliative care units in Winnipeg, Canada, and asked them to rate their sense <b>of</b> <b>dignity.</b> Our main outcome measures included: a 7 -point sense <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> item; the symptom distress scale; the McGill pain questionnaire; the index of independence in activities of daily living (IADL); a quality of life scale; a brief battery of self-report measures, including screening for desire for death, anxiety, hopelessness, and will to live; burden to others; and requirement for social support. 16 of 213 patients (7 · 5 %; 95 % CI 4 – 11) indicated that loss <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> was a great concern. These patients were far more than likely {{than the rest of the}} cohort to report psychological distress and symptom distress, heightened dependency needs, and loss of will to live.

40|$|This study aims {{to develop}} a {{preliminary}} model <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> management (MDM) in hospice describing the social process used by the interdisciplinary team to support the <b>dignity</b> <b>of</b> the patient-family unit in hospice. A qualitative, grounded theory methodology was used to achieve this goal. Research samples, including dying patients, their families and hospice staff, were recruited from a residential hospice in North Amherst, Massachusetts. Data collection methods included interview, observation, and document review. Symbolic interactionism and pragmatism provided the philosophical basis for this study. Thematic {{analysis was used to}} explore the definitions of dignity; and grounded theory analytic techniques for theory discovery, including constant comparison, opening, axial and selective coding, process, and the conditional matrix, were used to produce theoretical models. Definitions <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> for patients and families, which were synthesized based on data from patients, families, and staff in hospice, were presented. The model <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> in hospice (MDH) was developed by referring to the conditional matrix to elaborate the phenomenon <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> in hospice. In this model, dignity was placed in the context of hospice with an extension to the community that patients and families belonged to. Resources and social support from community are located in the community level; agency policies and missions, environment of the residential hospice, and services and resources from the residential hospice are agency-level factors to support dignity. The interdisciplinary team locates in the group individual level of the model. Incidents in the interactional level and the core actions refer to the process <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> management. The preliminary model <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> management (MDM) was proposed to describe the process the interdisciplinary team used to manage dignity in hospice. The four modules in the model refer to the steps to manage dignity in hospice, flowing from “acknowledge,” “define” to “prepare” and “manage” to formalize the process <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> management in hospice. Themes and subthemes within each module indicated the ways to complete each step. Finally, two cases were used to describe and tentatively verify the preliminary model <b>of</b> <b>dignity</b> management in hospice...|$|R
