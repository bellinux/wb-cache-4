40|$|The {{need to know}} precise {{particle}} size distributions {{for a variety of}} applications has {{led to the development of}} new particle sizing techniques. A particularly useful technique is that of forward light scattering utilised by the Malvern Laser Particle Sizer. This new technique has been used to measure the {{particle size}} distributions of three powders, (silica, latex and minusil) and the results compared with size distributions determined by the more traditional techniques (Coulter counter, <b>Warman</b> <b>cyclosizer</b> and Andreasen pipette). The new instrument showed good agreement with existing techniques for those samples in which the particles were spherical...|$|E
