5|$|Symphony in White, No. 3 shows Heffernan {{reclining}} {{on a sofa}} <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> {{rested on}} her hand, while Jones is seated on the floor, leaning against the sofa. There is a fan on the floor, and a plant bearing white flowers on the right. The fan is an oriental element, and {{an expression of the}} artistic trend known as Japonisme which was then prevalent in European art. At the time, Whistler was greatly influenced by his friend and colleague Albert Joseph Moore. The painting bears close resemblances to Moore's roughly contemporary painting , though at the time the two were working so closely together {{that it is hard to}} ascertain exactly who influenced whom.|$|E
5|$|The {{nurse was}} due to arrive at 9:00 the morning of February 11, 1963, to help Plath with the care of her children. Upon arrival, she could not get into the flat, but {{eventually}} gained access {{with the help of}} a workman, Charles Langridge. They found Plath dead of carbonmonoxide poisoning <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> in the oven, having sealed the rooms between her and her sleeping children with tape, towels and cloths. At approximately 4:30am, Plath had placed her head in the oven, with the gas turned on. She was 30years old.|$|E
5|$|Gaga, with {{shoulder}} and facial protrusions (prosthetic makeup mimicking subdermal implants) walks in {{a seemingly endless}} black space, where people are {{on their hands and}} knees in an organized pattern. She raises her hand and crouches down to join them. When the first verse begins, everyone dances to choreography. The scenes alternate between the dance, and Gaga singing on her throne in space. In the second verse, Gaga and Rico are in tuxedos, with her face painted to mirror his. Alternating clips show Gaga caressing and attempting to dance with him while he stays expressionless and motionless for the most part. When the chorus plays for the second time, Gaga sings in a room of mirrors, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> displayed in a glass box among oddly distorted mannequin heads. In the succeeding shots, she is once again shown on her throne giving birth to more members of the new race. After choreographed routines by Gaga and her dancers, they all gather in a circle and embrace in a hug.|$|E
60|$|When {{school was}} {{dismissed}} Anne marched out <b>with</b> <b>her</b> red <b>head</b> held high. Gilbert Blythe tried to intercept {{her at the}} porch door.|$|R
60|$|Then {{he motioned}} {{her out and}} she went, like a proud queen, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> glorious <b>head</b> erect and no shame on her brow.|$|R
6000|$|... "I stopped {{their mouths}} {{with a glass}} o' bitter each, {{and went back to}} my seat while they was {{drinking}} it. I told Miss Lamb in whispers that 'e wasn't there, but I'd 'ave another look for him by and by. If she'd ha' whispered back it would ha' been all right, but she wouldn't, and, arter a most unpleasant scene, she walked out <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>'ead</b> in the air follered by me with two men in buttons and a policeman.|$|R
5|$|The Nightmare {{simultaneously}} offers {{both the}} image of a dream—by indicating the effect of the nightmare on the woman—and a dream image—in symbolically portraying the sleeping vision. It depicts a sleeping woman draped over the end of a bed <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> hanging down, exposing her long neck. She is surmounted by an incubus that peers out at the viewer. The sleeper seems lifeless and, lying on her back, takes a position then believed to encourage nightmares. Her brilliant coloration is set against the darker reds, yellows, and ochres of the background; Fuseli used a chiaroscuro effect to create strong contrasts between light and shade. The interior is contemporary and fashionable and contains a small table on which rests a mirror, phial, and book. The room is hung with red velvet curtains which drape behind the bed. Emerging from a parting in the curtain is the head of a horse with bold, featureless eyes.|$|E
5|$|The {{figures of}} both Venus and Cupid were {{significantly}} altered during the painting process, {{the result of}} the artist's corrections to the contours as initially painted. Pentimenti can be seen in Venus's upraised arm, in the position of her left shoulder, and on her head. Infra-red reveals that she was originally shown more upright <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> turned to the left. An area on the left of the painting, extending from Venus's left foot to the left leg and foot of Cupid, is apparently unfinished, but this feature is seen in many other works by Velázquez and was probably deliberate. The painting was given a major cleaning and restoration in 1965–66, which showed it to be in good condition, and with very little paint added later by other artists, contrary to what some earlier writers had asserted.|$|E
25|$|A Churel {{may also}} be a shape-shifter. She can assume the form of a {{beautiful}} young woman, carrying a lantern <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> covered to charm any man she comes upon. Korwas believe that a Churel appears as a beautiful woman while the Patari and Majhwar think that she appears as a young girl in white clothes.|$|E
60|$|Still, she was {{not more}} than a woman, and at last the eyes grew hazy, while every joint ached. There was a horrible cramp in her shoulder, and to lessen it she moved a trifle so that her arm rested on the pillow. That was easier, and while she {{struggled}} <b>with</b> <b>her</b> weariness <b>her</b> <b>head</b> followed it, until it sank down close by Alton's shoulder. Then for five minutes she fought <b>with</b> <b>her</b> weakness, and was vanquished, for <b>her</b> <b>head</b> settled lower into its resting place, and her eyes closed.|$|R
60|$|No {{word was}} spoken {{until we had}} left the city far behind, but I could hear the quiet sobbing of Dejah Thoris as she clung to me <b>with</b> <b>her</b> dear <b>head</b> resting against my shoulder.|$|R
60|$|Robert Acton {{began to}} blush; {{but there was}} no {{occasion}} for it, for every one was looking at Gertrude--every one, at least, save Lizzie, who, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> pretty <b>head</b> on one side, contemplated her brother.|$|R
25|$|As {{the young}} queen larva pupates <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> down, the workers cap the queen cell with beeswax. When ready to emerge, the virgin queen will chew a {{circular}} cut around the cap of her cell. Often the cap swings open {{when most of}} the cut is made, so as to appear like a hinged lid.|$|E
25|$|Her tomb {{was created}} by Pietro Torrigiano, who {{probably}} arrived in England in 1509 and received the commission in the following year. The gilded bronze sculpture on the tomb depicts Margaret <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> resting on pillows and her hands raised in prayer, wearing garments characteristic of widowhood; the face was probably sculpted from a death mask. The black marble tomb is embellished with heraldic bronze insignia, including a yale, her heraldic badge, at her feet.|$|E
25|$|This {{problem was}} studied {{by a group}} of professors from the Department of Biological Science in the University of Aarhus, Denmark and the School of Science at Charles Darwin University in Darwin, Australia. They studied Camponotus anderseni in a series of {{experiments}} to determine varying carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in nests. During inundation, a soldier sacrifices herself to block the entrance hole <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> which effectively prevents flooding inside the nest. Once this occurs, the area can be very crowded, with the ants and coccids filling up to half the volume, and the conditions in the nests during a flood become hypercapnic and hypoxic.|$|E
60|$|George {{fell back}} and stood {{watching}} the girl, {{who was in}} a white dress, with a little hood trimmed <b>with</b> swansdown over <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R
60|$|He {{stood before}} <b>her,</b> <b>with</b> his <b>head</b> down, and sighed bitterly.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few moments}} she reappeared, waited a moment <b>with</b> <b>her</b> tiny <b>head</b> just peeking out of the knot-hole, flashed round the post out of sight, and when I saw her again it was as she reappeared {{suddenly}} beside the male.|$|R
25|$|The {{content of}} the {{triangular}} tablet reiterates triplicity. It depicts three crowned goddesses, each <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> pointing at an angle and her feet pointing toward the center. The name of the goddess appears above her head: Dione (ΔΙΟΝΗ), Phoebe (ΦΟΙΒΙΗ), and the obscure Nyche (ΝΥΧΙΗ). Amibousa, a word referring to the phases of the moon, is written under each goddess's feet. Densely inscribed spells frame each goddess: the inscriptions around Dione and Nyche are voces magicae, incantatory syllables ("magic words") that are mostly untranslatable. Melinoë appears in a triple invocation {{that is part of}} the inscription around Phoebe: O Persephone, O Melinoë, O Leucophryne. Esoteric symbols are inscribed on the edges of the triangle.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1967, Seedman, then chief detective for {{southern}} Brooklyn, caught {{the case that}} made his reputation as an investigator who could solve baffling cases. While driving on the Belt Parkway one summer morning near Plum Beach, a young woman named Nancy McEwen suddenly drifted off the road onto the median strip. A police lieutenant in the car behind her pulled over {{to see what the}} problem was. He found her moaning, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> slumped forward, and called for an ambulance. She died a short time later at Coney Island Hospital, where doctors found a small hole on the side of her head that turned out to have been caused by a bullet.|$|E
25|$|The film's script {{went through}} a few drafts before a {{shooting}} script was finalized. The first version was much darker than the final film. Various scenes were cut, including one which portrayed Billy's mother dying in her struggle with the gremlins, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> thrown down the stairs when Billy arrives. Dante later explained the scene made the film darker than the filmmakers wanted. There was also a scene where the gremlins ate Billy's dog and a scene where the gremlins attacked a McDonald's, eating customers instead of burgers. Also, instead of Stripe being a mogwai who becomes a gremlin, there was originally no mogwai named Stripe; rather, Gizmo was supposed to transform into Stripe the gremlin. Spielberg overruled this plot element as he felt Gizmo was cute and that audiences would {{want him to be}} present throughout the film.|$|E

60|$|He hastened {{out of the}} cottage, and the {{old woman}} {{followed}} him to the gate, watching him sadly <b>with</b> <b>her</b> shaking <b>head</b> as he almost ran towards the town. He was going to inquire at the place where the Oakbourne coach stopped.|$|R

25|$|The American coot {{typically}} {{has long}} courtship periods. This courtship period {{is characterized by}} billing, bowing, and nibbling. Males generally initiate billing, which is the touching of bills between individuals. As the pair bond becomes more evident, {{both males and females}} will initiate billing only with each other and not other males or females. After a pair bond is cemented, the mating pair looks for a territory to build a nest in. A pair bond becomes permanent when a nesting territory is secured. Copulation behavior among coot pairs always falls under the same general pattern. First the male chases the female. Then, the female moves to the display platform and squats <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> under the water. The male then mounts the female, using his claws and wings to balance on the female's back while the she brings her head above the water. Sexual intercourse usually takes no longer than two seconds.|$|E
25|$|However, in 1882 R. Mowat {{published}} an inscription in which Fortuna is called daughter of Jupiter, raising new questions and opening new perspectives in {{the theology of}} Latin gods. Dumézil has elaborated an interpretative theory according to which this aporia would be an intrinsic, fundamental feature of Indoeuropean deities of the primordial and sovereign level, as it finds a parallel in Vedic religion. The contradiction would put Fortuna both at the origin of time and into its ensuing diachronic process: it is the comparison offered by Vedic deity Aditi, the Not-Bound or Enemy of Bondage, that shows {{that there is no}} question of choosing one of the two apparent options: as the mother of the Aditya she has the same type of relationship with one of his sons, Dakṣa, the minor sovereign who represents the Creative Energy, being at the same time his mother and daughter, as is true for the whole group of sovereign gods to which she belongs. Moreover, Aditi is thus one of the heirs (along with Savitr) of the opening god of the Indoiranians, as she is represented <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> on her two sides, with the two faces looking opposite directions. The mother of the sovereign gods has thence two solidal but distinct modalities of duplicity, i.e. of having two foreheads and a double position in the genealogy. Angelo Brelich has interpreted this theology as the basic opposition between the primordial absence of order (chaos) and the organisation of the cosmos.|$|E
500|$|They wrote, [...] "There was one lift {{that was}} truly {{spectacular}} – Frank {{would pick up}} Yolanda, spin her <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> down, then throw her out where she landed on one knee in a low lunge, back leg extended. They never did any thing acrobatic, but this lift was spectacular." ...|$|E
60|$|And then {{something}} came to him--WHAT I cannot tell you. Perhaps, in his dreams, a man {{may see a}} creature which has what it has not got, and has not got what it has. At least, {{that was what the}} Welwa seemed like to Petru. She flew <b>with</b> <b>her</b> feet, and walked <b>with</b> <b>her</b> wings; <b>her</b> <b>head</b> was in <b>her</b> back, and her tail was on top of her body; her eyes were in her neck, and her neck in her forehead, and how to describe her further I do not know.|$|R
50|$|A three-quarter length {{depiction}} of Agnes of Rome shows the saint in direct communication <b>with</b> God. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> is slightly raised, her mouth half open, and {{the fingers of}} her hand are spread open over <b>her</b> heart while <b>with</b> <b>her</b> other hand she caresses the Mystic Lamb. Her neckline shifts sideways to reveal part of her shoulder, the highest degree of eroticism {{in the work of}} Stanzione.|$|R
60|$|Her orisons {{sent her}} forth all brightness, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> small <b>head</b> raised {{like that of}} a young fawn, her fresh lips parted by an {{incipient}} smile of hope, and her cheeks in a rosy glow of health, a very Hebe, as Mr. Saville had once called her.|$|R
500|$|Tatlock {{suffered}} from severe clinical depression, and {{was being treated}} at Mount Zion. At around 1 pm on January 5, 1944, her father arrived at her apartment at 1405 Montgomery Street. When {{there was no response}} to his ringing the doorbell, he climbed in through a window. He found her dead, lying on a pile of cushions in the bathroom, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> submerged in the partly-filled bathtub. There was an unsigned suicide note, which read: ...|$|E
500|$|Burial 9 was interred in a cist {{immediately}} beneath Burial 7 in the Talud-Tablero Temple (5C-49). The chamber measured [...] (NS by EW). The {{remains were}} of an adolescent female {{lying on her}} back <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> towards the north. She was lying upon a layer of cinnabar mixed with blue and green pigments and {{was accompanied by a}} rich funerary offering. The offering included mother-of-pearl, jade and quartz beads, bone earspools inlaid with shell, shell figurines, glyphs crafted from shell, a jade pectoral crafted {{in the form of an}} anthropomorphic face, an alabaster bowl, a polychrome ceramic vessel decorated with human figures and a lengthy hieroglyphic text, a black bowl and a tripod plate decorated with an ajaw glyph.|$|E
500|$|When Adjeng goes {{clubbing}} {{with her}} friends, she drinks {{too much and}} vomits, later passing out in a toilet. As she lies <b>with</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> on the seat she recalls that, as a child (Nadya Romples), she {{had been forced to}} eat vegetables she had previously vomited. Later, when Andien uses her apartment for a one-night stand, Adjeng peeks and recalls how she had observed her mother having sex with her lover (Bucek Depp), a man who had previously molested Adjeng– an act which is not shown explicitly. This background, as well as her recollections of life as a teenager (played by Banyu Bening) at the home of her womanising father (August Melasz) are worked into Adjeng's short story [...] "Lintah" [...] ("Leech").|$|E
60|$|Opposite to him {{sits the}} Story Girl, <b>with</b> <b>her</b> scarlet rosetted <b>head,</b> <b>her</b> {{beautiful}} bare feet crossed before her, one slender hand propping her high, white brow, {{on either side}} of which fall her glossy curls.|$|R
