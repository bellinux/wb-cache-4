So Dick Lester said, 'We are going to use that title.'" ...|$|E
500|$|During a 1900 Congressional deadlock, she {{departed}} for Honolulu with her Washington, D.C., Doctor Charles H. English (sometimes {{referred to as}} John H. English). Newspapers speculated that the Queen, having been diagnosed with cancer, <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>home</b> to die. Historian Helena G. Allen {{made the case that}} English intended to gain title to crown lands for himself. According to Allen, the Queen balked at his draft of a settlement letter to Senator George Frisbie Hoar that he wanted her to copy in her handwriting and sign. A month after her return, the Doctor was terminated [...] "without cause" [...] and subsequently sued her.|$|E
500|$|According to Plutarch, when Demosthenes first {{addressed}} {{himself to}} the people, he was derided for his strange and uncouth style, [...] "which was cumbered with long sentences and tortured with formal arguments to a most harsh and disagreeable excess". Some citizens, however, discerned his talent. When he first left the ecclesia (the Athenian Assembly) disheartened, an old man named Eunomus encouraged him, saying his diction was very much like that of Pericles. Another time, after the ecclesia had refused to hear him and he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>home</b> dejected, an actor named Satyrus followed him and entered into a friendly conversation with him.|$|E

500|$|Within {{half an hour}} fleeing Ford's Theatre, Booth {{crossed the}} Navy Yard Bridge into Maryland. [...] An army sentry {{questioned}} him about his late-night travel; Booth said that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>home</b> to {{the nearby town of}} Charles. Though it was forbidden for civilians to cross the bridge after 9 p.m., the sentry let him through. David Herold made it across the same bridge less than an hour later and rendezvoused with Booth. After retrieving weapons and supplies previously stored at Surattsville, Herold and Booth went to the home of Samuel A. Mudd, a local doctor, who splinted the leg Booth had broken in jumping from the presidential box, and later made a pair of crutches for Booth.|$|E
500|$|After dismissing a {{few more}} {{questions}} as [...] "unimportant", the 18-year-old giggled childishly and said he [...] "needed a lawyer". Lamb's conversation with the doctor continued incoherently, with Lamb [...] "leaping from topic to topic", in Yaworsky's words. The young man continued to rise and pace around the room as the interview went on; {{he spoke in a}} casual, off-hand manner, giving non-specific answers to the doctor's questions and describing people especially vaguely. When asked about his parents, he simply said [...] "I don't remember." [...] Yaworsky then inquired where his mother was, leading the boy to laugh as he replied, [...] "I don't remember. Somewhere." [...] When the doctor finally asked directly about the night of the shootings, Lamb said that he could not recall shooting anybody and that all he remembered <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>home</b> in a taxi, then being awoken by his uncle shaking him.|$|E

2500|$|Adjoined {{relative}} clause. These languages {{have the}} relative clause completely outside the main clause, {{and use a}} correlative structure to link the two. These languages also have nonreduced relative clauses. Hindi is the most well known such language, and have a structure similar to [...] "Which man I saw yesterday, that man went home" [...] or (with non-fronting of the relativized noun in the relative clause) [...] "I saw which man yesterday, that man went home". Another example is Warlpiri, which constructs relative clauses of a form similar to [...] "I saw the man yesterday, which he was going home". However, it is sometimes said these languages have no relative clauses at all, since the sentences of this form can equally well translate as [...] "I saw the man who <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>home</b> yesterday" [...] or [...] "I saw the man yesterday when/while he was going home".|$|E
