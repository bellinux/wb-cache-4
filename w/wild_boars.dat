40|$|BACKGROUND In {{parallel}} to the increase of <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> abundance in the past decades, an increase {{of exposure to the}} Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV) has been reported in <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> in several parts of Europe.

We tested <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> sera collected from 2008 - 2013 with a commercial ELISA for antibodies against ADV. To set our data in the European context, we reviewed scientific publications on ADV serosurveys in Europe for two time periods (1995 - 2007 and 2008 - 2014).

40|$|BRUCELLOSIS {{is found}} in {{domestic}} and feral pigs around the world, and also in <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> (Sus scrofa), and can be transmitted to human beings. It {{is considered to be}} a re-emerging disease in domestic pigs in Europe due to the increasing number of outbreaks on pig farms, often associated with spillover from infected <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> (Godfroid and Käsbohrer 2002, Leuenberger and others 2007). In Spain, populations of <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> have increased over the past three decades. In south-central Spain, fencing, supplemental feeding and illegal restocking of <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> have become common management practices in order to increase the number of <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> in the region. These practices are not common in the north of the country, with the exception of uncon-trolled restocking, which has been reported in recent decades. Illegal restocking may have been carried out in one of three different ways: by breeding <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> in captivity and releasing them; by interbreed-ing domestic pigs and <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> to increase the size of the animals and the number and size of litters; and by importing and releasing <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> from other European countries, mainly France (Rosell 1995, Garin-Bastuji and Delcueillerie 2001).

40|$|Abstract Background The goal of {{this study}} was {{describing}} the temporal evolution of Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV) contact prevalence among Eurasian <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> (Sus scrofa) populations under different management regimes and contact likelihoods with domestic pigs. Given the recent increase in <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> abundance throughout Europe, we hypothesized that <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> contact with ADV would remain stable in time even after significant reduction of ADV prevalence in domestic pigs. Results Sera from 1659 <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> were collected from 2000 to 2010 within 6 areas of the Iberian Peninsula and tested for the presence of antibodies against ADV by ELISA. According to sampling date, <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> were grouped into three time periods. ADV prevalence was compared through period both globally and by geographic area. Overall seroprevalence for the ten-year study period was 49. 6 ± 2. 4 %. The highest seroprevalence was recorded in areas with intense <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> management. The annual proportion of positive <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> sampling sites remained stable through the study period, while the percentage of domestic pig AD positive counties decreased from 70 % in 2003 to 1. 7 % in 2010. Conclusions Results presented herein confirmed our hypothesis that ADV would remain almost stable in <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> populations.

40|$|Enzootic {{pneumonia}} (EP) {{caused by}} Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae {{has a significant}} economic impact on domestic pig production. A control program carried out from 1999 to 2003 successfully reduced disease occurrence in domestic pigs in Switzerland, but recurrent outbreaks suggested a potential role of free-ranging <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> (Sus scrofa) {{as a source of}} re-infection. Since little is known on the epidemiology of EP in <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> populations, our aims were: (1) to estimate the prevalence of M. hyopneumoniae infections in <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> in Switzerland; (2) to identify risk factors for infection in wild boar; and (3) to assess whether infection in <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> is associated with the same gross and microscopic lesions typical of EP in domestic pigs. Nasal swabs, bronchial swabs and lung samples were collected from 978 <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> from five study areas in Switzerland between October 2011 and May 2013. Swabs were analyzed by qualitative real time PCR and a histopathological study was conducted on lung tissues. Risk factor analysis was performed using multivariable logistic regression modeling. Overall prevalence in nasal swabs was 26. 2 % (95 % CI 23. 3 - 29. 3 %) but significant geographical differences were observed. <b>Wild</b> <b>boar</b> density, occurrence of EP outbreaks in domestic pigs and young age were identified as risk factors for infection. There was a significant association between infection and lesions consistent with EP in domestic pigs. We have concluded that M. hyopneumoniae is widespread in the Swiss <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> population, that the same risk factors for infection of domestic pigs also act as risk factors for infection of <b>wild</b> <b>boar,</b> and that infected <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> develop lesions similar to those found in domestic pigs. However, based on our data and the outbreak pattern in domestic pigs, we propose that spillover from domestic pigs to <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> is more likely than transmission from <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> to pigs...|$|R

5|$|The American {{alligator}} {{is considered}} an apex predator throughout its range. They are opportunists and their diet is determined largely by both the size and age of the American alligator and the size and availability of prey. Most American alligators will eat {{a wide variety of}} animals, including invertebrates, fish, birds, turtles, snakes, amphibians, and mammals. Hatchlings mostly feed on invertebrates such as insects, insect larvae, snails, spiders, and worms. As they grow, American alligators gradually expand to larger prey. Once an American alligator reaches adulthood, any animal living in the water or coming to the water to drink is potential prey, due to the size and power of the American alligator. However, most animals captured by American alligators are considerably smaller than the American alligator itself. Stomach contents show, among native mammals, muskrats and raccoons {{are some of the most}} commonly eaten species. In Louisiana, where introduced coypu are common, they are perhaps the most regular prey for adult American alligators, although only larger adult American alligators commonly eat this species. Other animals may occasionally be eaten, even large deer or feral <b>wild</b> <b>boars,</b> but these are not normally part of the diet. Occasionally, domestic animals, including dogs, cats, and calves, are taken as available, but are secondary to wild and feral prey. Other prey, including snakes, lizards, and various invertebrates, are eaten occasionally by adults. Water birds, such as herons and egrets, storks, waterfowl and large dabbling rails such as gallinules or coots, are taken when possible. Occasionally, unwary adult birds are grabbed and eaten by American alligators, but most predation on bird species occur with unsteady fledgling birds in late summer as the prey of American alligators, as fledgling birds attempt to make their first flights near the water's edge.|$|E

The Eurasian <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> (Sus scrofa) is a MTC maintenance host in Mediterranean Iberia (Spain and Portugal). However, few systematic studies in <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> {{have been carried out}} in Atlantic regions. We describe the prevalence, distribution, pathology and epidemiology of MTC and other mycobacteria from <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> in Atlantic Spain. A total of 2, 067 <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> were sampled between 2008 and 2012. Results The results provide insight into the current status of <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> as MTC and Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) hosts in temperate regions of continental Europe. The main findings were a low TB prevalence (2. 6 %), a low proportion of MTC infected <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> displaying generalized TB lesions (16. 7 %), and a higher proportion of MAC infections (4. 5 %). Molecular typing revealed epidemiological links between <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> and domestic – cattle, sheep and goat – and other wildlife – Eurasian badger (Meles meles) and red fox (Vulpes vulpes) – hosts. Conclusions This study shows that the likelihood of MTC excretion by <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> in Atlantic habitats is much lower than in Mediterranean areas.

40|$|The <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> (Sus scrofa L.) {{population}} {{has increased in}} most parts of Europe during the last three decades.

Although plasticity of <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> to various environmental conditions is well known, understanding the ecological patterns that promote the density distribution of the species within agricultural areas remains of importance for adapted management strategies within these landscapes.

[Conclusions]: Oral re-vaccination of <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> with BCG yields a strong protective response against challenge with a field strain. Moreover, re-vaccination of <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> with BCG is not counterproductive. These findings are relevant given that re-vaccination is likely to happen under real (field) conditions. Carlos Martín, Universidad de Zaragoza, kindly provided the vaccine BCG strain. Many colleagues at SaBio IREC, NEIKER and VISAVET granted valuable technical help.

40|$|The <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> has, {{over the}} past few decades, {{undergone}} an expansion in Europe, which may have negatively affected ground-nesting bird populations and particularly those of wading birds. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate predation on waders’ nests by <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> in Sweden, where this species has been increasing since its reintroduction. This was done by placing artificial nests in seven different study areas. A comparison was then made of predation rates of the nests placed on control plots (areas in which no <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> were present but other predators were) and plots containing different abundances of <b>wild</b> <b>boar.</b> Contrary to our expectations, the proportion of nests predated was significantly lower in those areas in which <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> were present, with a predation rate of 54 %, whereas the predation rate was 87. 5 % in the others. The <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> was identified as the second most important nest predator in the plots in which it was present, accounting for 18 % of the predated nests. The main predator on both types of plots was the red fox, which was responsible for 28 and 38. 5 % of the predated nests on plots with/without <b>wild</b> <b>boar,</b> respectively. Interestingly, predation by badgers occurred principally in areas in which the <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> was absent (34. 5 % of the predated nests), whereas only one nest was predated by this predator in areas containing <b>wild</b> <b>boar.</b> It is not, however, possible to state whether predation by badgers was lower because of the presence of <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> or whether this was owing to the fact that badgers do not select those particular patches because of habitat features.

40|$|The Eurasian <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> (Sus scrofa) is {{increasingly}} {{considered as a}} relevant actor in the epidemiology of animal tuberculosis (TB). Therefore, monitoring TB in <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> becomes a key tool for establishing comprehensive control schemes for this disease. To estimate the exposure of free living <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> to Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC) in France, a bovine-purified protein derivative based ELISA {{was used to test}} 2, 080 archived serum samples of hunter-harvested animals in 58 French "départements". Two cut-off values were used for diagnostic interpretation: 0. 2, recommended by the manufacturer (specificity: 96. 43 %; sensitivity: 72. 6 %), and 0. 5 (specificity: 100 %; sensitivity: 64 %). During the same period, at the 0. 2 cut-off, global true seroprevalence was 5. 9 % (IC 95 %: 4. 3 %- 7. 7 %) and 76 % of the sampled "départements" had seropositive <b>wild</b> <b>boar,</b> including seven cattle TB-free "départements. At the 0. 5 cut-off, global true seroprevalence was 2. 2 % (IC 95 %: 1. 5 - 3. 2) and positive <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> belonged to 21 % of the "départements". All but one of these positive "départements" had reported at least one cattle TB outbreak since 2000. A good consistence between seropositive <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> and TB outbreaks in cattle was found, especially at the 0. 5 cut-off value (the mean distance to the nearest cattle TB outbreak was 13 km and 27 km for seropositive and seronegative <b>wild</b> <b>boar,</b> respectively; P< 0. 05). The use of an ELISA to detect MTC antibodies in <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> has permitted the description of the geographic distribution of MTC contact in <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> in France. Our results suggest that the ELISA {{could be used as a}} first screening tool to conduct TB surveillance in <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> at a population level. High-risk <b>wild</b> <b>boar</b> populations (e. g. overabundant) could be tested and if identified positive by ELISA they should be surveyed in detail by combining pathology and culture...|$|R
