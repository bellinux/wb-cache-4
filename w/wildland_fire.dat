5|$|A {{wildfire}} or <b>wildland</b> <b>fire</b> is {{a fire in}} an area of combustible vegetation {{that occurs}} in the countryside or rural area. Depending on the type of vegetation where it occurs, a wildfire can also be classified more specifically as a brush fire, bush fire, desert fire, forest fire, grass fire, hill fire, peat fire, vegetation fire, or veld fire. Fossil charcoal indicates that wildfires began soon after the appearance of terrestrial plants 420 million years ago. Wildfire’s occurrence throughout the history of terrestrial life invites conjecture that fire must have had pronounced evolutionary effects on most ecosystems' flora and fauna.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of {{research}} conducted after the fires, a new fire management plan for Yellowstone was implemented in 1992. The plan observed stricter guidelines for managing natural fires, increased the staffing levels of fire monitors and related occupations, and allocated greater funding for fire management. By 2004, further amendments to the <b>wildland</b> <b>fire</b> management plan were added. According to the 2004 plan, natural wildfires are allowed to burn, so long as parameters regarding fire size, weather, and potential danger are not exceeded. Those fires that do exceed the standards, {{as well as all}} human-caused fires, are to be suppressed. These changes are primarily updates of the 1972 fire management plan and continue to emphasize the role of fire in maintaining a natural ecosystem, but apply stricter guidelines and lower levels of tolerance.|$|E
30|$|Eighty {{four percent}} of the {{respondents}} agreed that the main causes of <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> are hunting and bee smoking during honey harvesting. The burning of crop residues and land preparation for farming was cited by 80  % of the respondents as the second most common cause of <b>wildland</b> <b>fires.</b> Burning homestead surroundings to improve visibility was cited by 79  % of the respondents to be causing <b>wildland</b> <b>fires,</b> while 61  % of the respondents suggested that <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> are caused by deliberate arson.|$|R
30|$|Zimbabwe {{is among}} the most fire prone {{countries}} in Africa south of the Sahara. Annually over 1 million hectares of land are destroyed by <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> during the fire season which runs from July to November. <b>Wildland</b> <b>fires</b> are caused by several agents, cost huge socio and economic loses and are difficult to police. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the causes of <b>wildland</b> <b>fires,</b> associated socio-economic impacts and challenges associated with policing <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> in Chakari resettlement area. Although the area studied was small compared to the whole country, the results showed typical challenges that are faced in many resettlement areas in Zimbabwe. The study used multiple sources of information including review of published literature, reports from regulatory agencies, questionnaires, interviews and field observations. The results from the study showed that 86  % of the respondents suggested that <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> are caused by human negligence and deliberate arson, 14  % suggested that <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> are caused by natural factors such as lightning and spontaneous ignition, while 6  % suggested that events such as vehicle and locomotive accidents and electron clouding of power lines cause <b>wildland</b> <b>fires.</b> The major human causes of <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> were cited as hunting and bee harvesting (84  %), burning of crop residues and land preparation (80  %), burning homestead surroundings to improve visibility (79  %) and deliberate arson was cited by 61  % of the respondents. Using the contingency valuation method, the estimated average income loss from <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> was US$ 1 408  ha− 1 year− 1. The major challenges faced in policing <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> included poor community participation in fire related activities (69  %), absence of deterrent fines (64  %), complexity of the crimes (51  %), inadequate training (45  %) and lack of resources (40  %). Fire management should move away from fire fighting to prevention and sustainable practices such as early burning. In addition there is need for extensive training of communities on fire management and managing ignition sources. Policing of <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> can be improved through availing more resources towards policing, improved training, establishing partnerships with local population and leadership, and empowering traditional leadership to police <b>wildland</b> <b>fires.</b>|$|R
30|$|In Zimbabwe {{cases of}} arson, were fires {{are used to}} settle {{disputes}} {{have been reported in}} large-scale forested areas where employees are disgruntled over non-payment of salaries or low salaries (Nyamadzawo et al. 2013). Nepstad et al. (1999) also identified forest fires as being used as a weapon in land tenure or land use disputes. <b>Wildland</b> <b>fires</b> can also be a result unextinguished roadside fires used by travelers and long distance truck drivers for cooking and warming especially in winter time. In addition, lit cigarettes thrown out from moving vehicles have been reported to cause roadside fires. These observations were supported by a report by EMA (2011) which showed that 60  % of all <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> occurred within 500  m from major highways. In addition vehicle, locomotives and electricity power lines accidents have been reported to cause <b>wildland</b> <b>fires.</b> There has been reports of trucks that caught fires along the major highways or vehicles that burn following accidents, with the end result being <b>wildland</b> <b>fires.</b> In addition to these anthropogenic causes of <b>wildland</b> <b>fires,</b> there are also natural causes such as spontaneous fires and lightning. Although, most dry-season <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> are ignited by man, lightning becomes probably the most common natural cause of <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> at the beginning of rain season (Komarek 1972; West 1972).|$|R
5|$|The forest {{maintains}} a full-time fire staff throughout the summer, {{not only to}} control and extinguish fires that pose threats to people and structures but also to set controlled burns. Their jobs include maintaining {{a high level of}} preparedness, keeping a vigilant lookout for fire activity, responding to reports of fires, maintaining equipment, monitoring weather and relative atmospheric dryness, and preparing daily fire activity reports, which are used to post fire information for visitors and staff. The forest has <b>wildland</b> <b>fire</b> engines, pumps, hand tools and fire hose at its disposal. A helicopter can be summoned quickly, along with support from the South Central Idaho Interagency Dispatch Center, including a team of smokejumpers and air tankers used to provide air support in dropping flame retardant and water. There are small areas around Stanley and Mount Harrison where aerial retardant would not be used {{in the case of a}} fire. The 10-member Sawtooth Helitack crew was established in 1963 and is based at Friedman Memorial Airport in Hailey. In the case of larger fires, the National Interagency Fire Command can quickly mobilize available resources. Only four of the original fire lookout towers remain standing in the forest, but they are no longer in use: Iron Mountain, Horton Peak, Lookout Mountain, and Mount Harrison, which was last fully staffed in 2007. Many of these towers were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps during the Great Depression.|$|E
25|$|Wildfire {{prevention}} programs {{around the world}} may employ techniques such as <b>wildland</b> <b>fire</b> use and prescribed or controlled burns. <b>Wildland</b> <b>fire</b> use refers to any fire of natural causes that is monitored but allowed to burn.

3000|$|The {{negative}} impacts of forest fires, have received worldwide media coverage (Moore et al. 2002). Examples include the Tillamook burn in Oregon in 1933 that destroyed over 310 000 acres (Ortolano 1997). In Zimbabwe in 2012 alone, more than 1 million hectares of land {{was destroyed by}} <b>wildland</b> <b>fires,</b> including property worth more than USD$ 200 000. In 2010, five deaths occurred due to <b>wildland</b> <b>fires,</b> while in 2011 twenty five deaths were attributed to <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> (The Herald 2011). According to the [...] Timber Producers Federation, in 2011 more than 10  % of Zimbabwe’s pine forests of economic value were destroyed by <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> alone.|$|R
30|$|The {{farmers in}} Chakari also obtain natural {{resources}} such as thatch grass, firewood and building materials from the forests which are often {{at the mercy of}} <b>wildland</b> <b>fires.</b> Thirty two percent of the respondents indentified burning of thatch grass and trees in general as the major impact of <b>wildland</b> <b>fires.</b> <b>Wildland</b> <b>fires</b> were also blamed for livestock mortality as they may fail to escape the infernos and this was very common especially with young animals (Table  1). The other negative impacts of <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> that were highlighted included the destruction of crops in fields, burning of fire wood, injury to forest and destruction of wild fruits and traditional herbs and medicine, and burning of pastures for livestock.|$|R
30|$|Policing <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> is {{affected}} greatly by several factors. The {{majority of respondents}} (69  %) cited poor community participation in issues of fires management as a major challenge in policing <b>wildland</b> <b>fires.</b> Corruption was highlighted 67  % of the respondents as another major challenge on effective policing in Chakari. The other perceived challenge was that of absence of deterrent punishment, which was cited by 64  % of respondents. In addition, 51  % of respondents indicated that complexity in crimes is a challenge in policing <b>wildland</b> <b>fires.</b>|$|R

25|$|Fire {{departments}} that serve areas along the wildland–urban interface {{are faced with}} unique challenges that departments based in larger cities or strictly rural areas {{do not need to}} worry about. Departments in these areas often elect to use a type of fire engine commonly referred to as a wildland-urban interface engine or simply interface engines. While technically considered a <b>wildland</b> <b>fire</b> engine by many, these maintain the traditional look and feel of a standard engine.|$|E
30|$|Hunting and bee {{harvesting}} {{were also}} {{cited as the}} major causes of <b>wildland</b> <b>fires.</b> In tandem with the current study Pinto and Alvarado (2011) in Bolivia found that the main causes of <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> were the hunters, followed by the burning of grasslands and slash, vandalism and unextinguished cigarettes. In Tanzania, Kilahama (2011) also reported that other major causes of <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> included game hunting, where fires were deliberately set to drive wild animals to intended destiny or to attract them, and also to allow re-growth in burnt areas for an easy catch.|$|R
30|$|In addition, {{the other}} causes of <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> that were {{highlighted}} included fire from roadside servitudes (60  %), fires from cigarettes stubs (51  %), fires from rubbish pits and settling of land were cited by 39  % of respondents. Population increase was also {{cited as a}} major cause of <b>wildland</b> <b>fires.</b> The increase in human population in Chakari has been fuelled by continuous land allocation, particularly in areas where farmers are given virgin land. Land clearing to prepare agricultural fields causes <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> when fires used for land clearing get out of hand.|$|R
30|$|Land {{clearance}} {{and preparation}} for cropping was cited {{among the top}} causes of <b>wildland</b> <b>fires.</b> These findings reaffirm the assertion by Goldammer (1993) that most <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> in smallholder farming areas occur during land preparation for agricultural purposes. A similar position was also reported by Kilahama (2011); Phiri et al. (2011) and EMA (2011). A report by EMA (2011) also showed that 80  % of the <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> occurred in A 1 and A 2 model resettlement farming areas {{where most of the}} new farmers used fires for land clearance.|$|R

30|$|<b>Wildland</b> <b>fires</b> affects {{different}} people differently, hence {{costs and benefits}} vary among different {{segments of the population}} and also site (Jordan 1985). The feminist theory found that <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> negatively affects livelihood of female in society. For instance, Sturgeon (1997) asserts that without modern energy sources, cooking meals and heating lead many women to rely on traditional energy sources like firewood, coal, fertilizer and agricultural waste. <b>Wildland</b> <b>fires</b> causes physical energy and time loss while fetching firewood from distant places. Furthermore, Fernandes and Geeta (1987) suggest that in parts of the Himalayas and the African Sahara, women and children spend 100 to 300  days a year on gathering fuel wood which is scarcer following <b>wildland</b> <b>fires.</b> Jackson and Fisher (2007) also reported that in rural areas where most of the people cannot afford to buy corrugated roofing sheets, women and young girls waste their hours and energy looking for thatch grass so as to meet the shelter needs of their families after <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> have consumed all grass that is used for thatching.|$|R
30|$|The {{negative}} impacts of <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> are huge and include {{the loss of}} property, crops, forest products and grazing, to name a few. Nyamadzawo et al. (2013) reported that in Zimbabwe acute impacts such as trauma are common among victims who their crops are destroyed by fires. In addition, the loss of shelter, personal goods through <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> has often left families traumatized, often families sleep in the open with no food supplies and proper water and sanitation facilities and this may result in stress, and can {{be a source of}} grief (Nyamadzawo et al. 2013).

2500|$|Wildland {{firefighting}} requires {{vehicles that}} can easily negotiate difficult terrain and high-gradient roads, be self-reliant, and have high clearances for wheels and suspension. These <b>wildland</b> <b>fire</b> engines are traditionally smaller than standard fire apparatus and are primarily used for vegetation fires or wildland fires. They may also respond to emergencies in rough terrain where other vehicles cannot respond. Most wildland engines feature four-wheel drive capability to improve hill climbing and rough terrain capability.

30|$|Pre-fire {{treatments}} that {{reduce the risk}} of soil damage and non-native plant invasions are preferred to high severity catastrophic <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> that initiate desertification (DeBano et al. 1998, Neary et al. 2005). Thinning of over-stocked stands and the introduction of prescribed fires have ecosystem impacts, but they are substantially less that those produced by <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> (Neary and Hornbeck 1994, Neary 2002). DeBano et al. (2005) clearly point out that sediment losses from typical silviculture operations are in the range of 0.04 to 15.00 Mg ha− 1. Prescribed fires typically produce sediment losses of 0.00 Mg ha− 1 to 8.44 Mg ha− 1, with most < 0.80 Mg ha− 1. On the other hand, <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> commonly result in soil erosion rates > 20 Mg ha− 1 and going up as high as 370 Mg ha− 1.

30|$|Most {{farmers in}} Chakari {{suggested}} that most <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> {{were caused by}} human errors, or negligence, while a small percent cited natural causes. Similar observations were also reported by Williams et al.

The results are also consistent with the sentiments by Huntley (1982) and Trollope (1982), who say that “in the savannas, lightning related fires generally occur during the dry season or early wet season, at intervals of 1 – 5 years”. West (1972) added that most dry-season <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> are ignited by man, but lightning becomes important {{at the beginning of the}} rains. Most key informants also agreed that human negligence and arson were the major causes of <b>wildland</b> <b>fires</b> in Chakari and in many other resettlement areas in Zimbabwe.
