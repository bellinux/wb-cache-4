[...] "We definitely {{did not get}} the <b>worst</b> <b>case</b> <b>scenario</b> with this storm", observed the Bermuda Weather Service; there were no fatalities {{as a result of the}} storm in Bermuda, and no damage was reported. Two ships reported tropical storm-force winds in association with the storm: the Maersk New Orleans, to the north of the storm's center, and a ship with the call sign WCZ858 to the east-southeast. Rip currents from Nate and the more distant Maria killed one and injured another in New Jersey; several others were caught in rip currents, though they were able to escape. In the Carolinas, Nate also contributed to heightened seas, though this time in combination with Hurricane Ophelia and persistent unrelated northeasterly winds.

40|$|Abstract: The current {{test methods}} are {{insufficient}} {{to evaluate and}} ensure the safety and reliability of vehicle system for all possible dynamic situation including the <b>worst</b> <b>case</b> such as rollover, spin-out and so on. Although the known NHTSA Sine with dwell steering maneuvers are applied for the vehicle performance assessment, they aren't enough to estimate other possible <b>worst</b> <b>case</b> <b>scenarios.</b> Therefore, it is crucial for us to verify the various <b>worst</b> <b>cases</b> including the existing severe steering maneuvers. This paper includes useful <b>worst</b> <b>case</b> based upon the existing <b>worst</b> <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> mentioned above and <b>worst</b> <b>case</b> evaluation for vehicle dynamic controller in simulation basis and UCC HILS. The only human steering angle is selected as a design parameter here and optimized to maximize the index function to be {{expressed in terms of}} both yaw rate and side slip angle. The obtained scenarios were enough to generate the <b>worst</b> <b>case</b> to meet NHTSA <b>worst</b> <b>case</b> definition.

Over the past four years, pandemic preparations have focused on responding to <b>worst</b> <b>case</b> <b>scenarios.</b> As a result, officials responded to the H 1 N 1 outbreak as an unfolding disaster.

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} novel {{framework}} to critically analyze a given MAC protocol for wireless adhoc networks {{with respect to}} its correctness criteria and performance metrics. The framework is composed of wanted state generation and test scenario generation algorithms. The wanted state generation algorithm generates a set of conditions that meet our study objective. The test generation algorithm then generates complete test scenarios that satisfy our objective, e. g., minimize {{the value of a}} particular performance metric. The core of our search engine utilizes novel algorithms that use combinations of goal-oriented backward and forward search and implications as well as heuristics that enable the generation of <b>worst</b> <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> in manageable complexity for our practical purposes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by using our framework to analyze the <b>worst</b> <b>case</b> performance, in terms of throughput and fairness of IEEE 802. 11 for adhoc networks. For all topologies, the <b>worst</b> <b>case</b> <b>scenarios</b> generated by our framework show the worst performance among all scenarios that we generate. The scenarios generated by our framework include the scenarios typically used for performance evaluation of IEEE 802. 11 protocol. The case study of IEEE 802. 11 shows that the complexity of our novel algorithms are quite practical. I...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{an important}} topic {{that has received}} little attention in the literature. The purpose of this discussion is to introduce a few additional points and discuss how different assumptions will alter the results in some cases. The discussion is brief because the paper is reasonably thorough. The paper discusses the shortfall of fees under the <b>worst</b> <b>case</b> <b>scenarios.</b> This can be ameliorated by hedging the fees {{as well as the}} claims. An insurer is not fully hedged otherwise. If an insurer wants to be fully insulated from the impact of the equity markets with respect to the profitability of guaranteed minimum benefits, then, in theory, hedging the claims converts a distribution of possible outcomes to one single outcome, and hedging the fees does the same. If an insurer hedges only one of the two, then equity risk exposure remains. Alternatively, some products charge fees based on the guarantee rather than the account value. Absent customer behavior dynamics, the fees are locked in, and {{there is no need to}} hedge. Customer behavior dynamics, however, will tend to result in higher fees in the <b>worst</b> <b>case</b> <b>scenarios,</b> which slightly reduces the net amount of hedge required...|$|R
