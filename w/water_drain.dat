Especially in cities with combined sewers, treatment plants do not function properly after heavy rains.

This will take some time, and agility will be seriously compromised. The damage should not be difficult to repair if the slit is cut with reasonable care.|$|E

The man bore a striking resemblance to a youthful Bevan Spencer von Einem.

Innisfail Hospital, meanwhile, suffered {{the loss of}} several windows, inciting the evacuation of patients to the first floor. The cyclone drove a small vessel ashore at nearby Banana Island; in addition, a teenage girl was severely impaled by a flying slab of iron in downtown Innisfail, later dying {{as a result of}} her injuries. Meanwhile, at Malanda, a man was knocked off a shed roof by a strong gust and was subsequently declared dead. Winds leveled dozens of structures at Mission Beach, Tully, Silkwood, Kurrimine Beach, Cardwell, El Arish, South Johnstone, and Mourilyan. At Mourilyan, 12boats sank in the town harbor, and all structures were damaged to some extent, with 20houses roofless and one flattened. At Tully, the capacity of the Kareeya Hydro Power Station was slightly reduced after rubbish became stuck in its components, and at Ingham, the Herbert River peaked at a height of , overflowing its barriers by [...] Cyclone Winifred inundated the main street of Ingham with flood waters, completely obstructed numerous north-to-south streets, flooded stores, and cut off electricity from Avergowie College. A 35-year-old man was discovered dead down a storm <b>water</b> <b>drain,</b> having drowned in the storm's flood waters. Debris and flooding also impeded and obstructed of parts of the Bruce, Gillies, and Palmerston highways.|$|E

2500|$|Thorpe Culvert {{takes its}} name from a culvert which was built under the river to drain water into the Bell <b>Water</b> <b>Drain.</b> The area {{to the north of the}} culvert became part of the Witham Fourth District in 1818, and the culvert was built soon afterwards. Responsibility for the drain passed to the Witham and Steeping Catchment Board {{following}} the passing of the Land Drainage Act in 1930, and they commissioned a new pumping station to pump water from the drain into the Steeping in 1938. It contained two Ruston and Hornsby diesel engines, driving [...] Gwynnes centrifugal pumps, and could pump 322M gallons (1,460Ml) per day when both were running.|$|E
2500|$|The Fourth District was {{extended}} in 1818, following another report by Rennie {{on the lower}} reaches of the Steeping River. An Act of Parliament was obtained in the same year, which authorised the straightening of the river, {{and the addition of}} , subsequently known as [...] "the 5000 acres", to the district. This area was located on the north-eastern bank of the Steeping River, and its main drainage channel was connected to the Bell <b>Water</b> <b>Drain</b> by three oval brick tunnels, each [...] long, which pass under the river. The tunnels were completed in 1821, and were entirely hidden until the construction of Lade Bank pumping station in 1867 lowered the water levels.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} access the water, one would go through the {{entrance}} (sar-dar) [...] which would always be open, traverse a stairway and reach the bottom where there would be faucets {{to access the}} water in the storage. Next to the faucet would be a built-in seat or platform, a <b>water</b> <b>drain</b> for disposing water from the faucet, and ventilation shafts. Depending on where (i.e. what depth) the faucets would be, the water would be colder or warmer. Some storages would have multiple faucets located at intervals along the stairway. Thus nobody had direct access to the body of water itself, hence minimizing possible contamination. The storage compartment is completely isolated from the outside except for ventilation shafts or windcatchers. To further minimize contamination, the storage tank’s interior was scattered with a salty compound that would form a surface on top of the water. The storage tank would then be monitored year round to ensure that the surface had not been disturbed. The water of course would be drawn from the bottom using the pasheer.|$|E

30|$|In New Zealand, {{regional}} governing organisations {{are developing}} new policies {{to assess and}} manage the effects of land use intensification on water quality (e.g. Waikato Regional Council 2012). Such policies require an assessment {{to be made of}} potential N leaching losses from different land uses, particularly where land use may be becoming more intensive. This paper compiles and synthesises the information on N concentrations and fluxes in stream and soil-water drainage from indigenous and planted forests in New Zealand with the objective of providing managers with a knowledge base to allow appropriate land use decisions to be made regarding water quality. The two types of forest-soil water that were considered, were <b>water</b> <b>draining</b> from below the majority of tree roots (hereafter referred to as <b>water</b> <b>draining</b> from the lower root zone) and water in small forest streams. Forest-soil <b>water</b> <b>draining</b> from the lower root zone was assessed/measured using gravity or tension lysimeters. <b>Water</b> <b>draining</b> from the lower root zone directly reflects the dissolved N response of the plant–soil interactions in the N cycle, whereas stream water reflects additional N processes such as denitrification in the riparian zone and/or in-stream N conversion (e.g. Cooper et al. 1987 Cooper and Thomsen 1988). In-stream processes mainly consume dissolved N, and thus lower concentrations of N are normally found in stream water than in <b>water</b> <b>draining</b> beneath the root zone (Gundersen et al. 2006).|$|R

He touched it with his lips and placed it back upon his hand, this token from the beloved dead, vowing that it should never leave his hand in life, and that after death it should be buried on him. And so it will be, perhaps to be dug up again thousands of years hence, and once more to play a part in the romance of unborn ages.|$|E
