25|$|Returning to Watkins Glen, Ambrose started {{fifth and}} {{dominated}} {{part of the}} race but was passed in a three-wide move by Kyle Busch with 20 laps remaining. When the white flag was about to wave he saw that Busch <b>was</b> <b>slipping</b> in oil; in {{the entrance to the}} esses he and Brad Keselowski passed him; Ambrose then saw that Keselowski <b>was</b> <b>slipping</b> in oil too and he took the lead in the final turn, holding off Keselowski {{for the second time in}} a row and defending his win from the previous year. Ambrose was very emotional about his win due to his father seeing it on television in a hospital for an illness and due to his luck that day. The win moved Ambrose up one position in the standings from 18th to 17th. Ambrose still has promised the racing world for a future oval win since his #1 goal currently is to prove he can win at places other than road courses.|$|E

I remember very well she said, 'Well that's {{the end of the}} vodka. There isn't any more.' Just like that you know. I wouldn't have thought of it much, except afterward I realized that that's what she was talking about. Dorothy was very pretty, and she traveled in this false world. She didn't want to be second to anybody, and she must have thought she <b>was</b> <b>slipping.</b>|$|E

(His affection for that country and its people, despite his wartime experiences, had first been explored in 1968 in his Portrait of Japan.) By now Ingaret <b>was</b> <b>slipping</b> into senility, and he spent much time with Frances Baruch, an old friend. In 1984 his son John (who had gone on to be an engineer in London) died, and van der Post spent time with his youngest daughter Lucia and her family.|$|E

25|$|The LB {{appears to}} have invented {{slipping}} coaches {{from the rear of}} express trains at intermediate stations for onward transmission to smaller stations. The earliest recorded example was at Haywards Heath in February 1858, where coaches for Hastings <b>were</b> <b>slipped</b> from a London-Brighton express. Thereafter the practice was used by other railways. Before 1914, 21 coaches <b>were</b> <b>slipped</b> each day on the Brighton main line. Coaches <b>were</b> <b>slipped</b> at Horley and Three Bridges for stations to East Grinstead, Forest Row and Horsham, or at Haywards Heath for stations to Brighton and Eastbourne. The practice continued until electrification of the main line in 1932.|$|R
25|$|The mining theory {{behind the}} {{ultimately}} wasteful {{development of the}} Pottsville Twin Shaft operation was not well grounded in the geologic science even of that time. But that theory alone did not make up Gowen's rationale for the massive expenditures of the Coal & Iron Co. He believed that the Schuylkill Valley—which from colonial times until the Civil War had been the center of American iron-making—would, because {{of the importance of}} anthracite iron, continue to hold that preeminent position indefinitely. He stated this belief forthrightly in the Reading Railroad annual report for 1870; but already the use of lower-cost coke made from more widely available bituminous coal, together with expanding markets in the Midwest and West, was driving the center of the iron industry (and soon, steelmaking) to Pittsburgh. Already the importance of anthracite as an indispensable industrial fuel <b>was</b> <b>slipping.</b>|$|E
25|$|Galla Placidia, as Augusta, {{mother of}} the Emperor, and his {{guardian}} until 437, could maintain a dominant position in court, but women in Ancient Rome did not exercise military power {{and she could not}} herself become a general. She tried for some years to avoid reliance on a single dominant military figure, maintaining a balance of power between her three senior officers, Aetius (magister militum in Gaul), Count Boniface governor in the Diocese of Africa, and Flavius Felix magister militum praesentalis in Italy. Meanwhile, the Empire deteriorated seriously. Apart from the losses in the Diocese of Africa, Hispania <b>was</b> <b>slipping</b> out of central control and into the hands of local rulers and Suevic bandits. In Gaul the Rhine frontier had collapsed, the Visigoths in Aquitaine may have launched further attacks on Narbo and Arelate, and the Franks, increasingly powerful although disunited, were the major power in the north-east. Aremorica was controlled by Bagaudae, local leaders not under the authority of the Empire. Aetius at least campaigned vigorously and mostly victoriously, defeating aggressive Visigoths, Franks, fresh Germanic invaders, Bagaudae in Aremorica, and a rebellion in Noricum. Not {{for the first time in}} Rome's history, a triumvirate of mutually distrustful rulers proved unstable. In 427 Felix tried to recall Boniface from Africa; he refused, and overcame Felix's invading force. Boniface probably recruited some Vandal troops among others.|$|E

Burrows shot the food fight scene twice, with the scene unchoreographed after {{the point where the}} character Sam Malone throws cranberry sauce at Diane Chambers' face. The extended takes resulted in a strong food odor around the set. In one of the food fight takes, the floor was covered with a [...] "plastic tarp" [...] in order to prevent vital materials from being broken while the cast <b>was</b> <b>slipping</b> on the floor during the scene. However, the attempt was ineffective.

500|$|For {{the next}} two months, Christian and his forces {{struggled}} to establish themselves on Tubuai. They began to construct a large moated enclosure—called [...] "Fort George", after the British king—to provide a secure fortress against attack by land or sea. Christian attempted to form friendly relations with the local chiefs, but his party was unwelcome. There were persistent clashes with the native population, mainly over property and women, culminating in a pitched battle in which 66 islanders were killed and many wounded. Discontent was rising among the Bounty party, and Christian sensed that his authority <b>was</b> <b>slipping.</b> He called a meeting to discuss future plans and offered a free vote. Eight remained loyal to Christian, the hard core of the active mutineers, but sixteen wished to return to Tahiti and take their chances there. Christian accepted this decision; after depositing the majority at Tahiti, he would [...] "run before the wind, and... land upon the first island the ship drives. After what I have done I cannot remain at Tahiti".|$|E
500|$|Although Khánh {{had seized}} power in January 1964 in {{alliance}} with Khiêm, the pair had soon fallen out over policy disputes along religious lines, and the Catholic Khiêm began to plot against Khánh. Khiêm {{was believed to}} have helped plan a failed coup in September 1964, and Khánh exiled him as a result. While in Washington, Khiêm continued to plot alongside his aide Thảo, who was actually a communist agent bent on trying to foment infighting at every opportunity. Aware of Thảo's plans, Khánh summoned him back to Vietnam in an apparent attempt to capture him, and Thảo responded by going into hiding and preparing for his attack. In the meantime, Khánh's hold on power <b>was</b> <b>slipping</b> as his military support dwindled, and he became increasingly reliant on the support of civilian Buddhist activists who favored [...] negotiations with the communists and opposed escalation of the Vietnam War. The Americansmost notably Ambassador Maxwell Taylorwere opposed to this and had been lobbying various senior Vietnamese officers such as Kỳ to overthrow Khánh, who knew that American-sponsored moves to depose him were afoot.|$|E

50|$|<b>Slip</b> {{stitches}} may <b>be</b> {{used for}} an easier method of double knitting that requires only one yarn be handled at one time. As a concrete example, consider a two-color pattern with {{a multiple of}} four stitches (labeled ABCD) being knit on double-pointed circular needles. On the first row, using color 1, stitch A is knitted, stitch B is purled, stitch C <b>is</b> <b>slipped</b> wyib and stitch D <b>is</b> <b>slipped</b> wyif. The knitter then slides the stitches {{back to the beginning}} (recall that the needles are double-pointed). Then, using color 2, stitch A <b>is</b> <b>slipped</b> wyib, stitch B <b>is</b> <b>slipped</b> wyif, stitch C is knitted and stitch D is purled. The knitter then turns the work and repeats indefinitely. The knitted and slipped wyib stitches come forward, whereas the purled and wyif stitches recede, resulting in a (very warm!) double-knit scarf alternating in the two colors with beautiful drape. The knit and purl stitches produce the front and back fabrics, respectively, of the double-knitted fabric while the slipped stitches allow for the alternation of color.|$|R

500|$|However, {{close friends}} of Grant {{saw that his}} public support <b>was</b> <b>slipping.</b> John Russell Young took Grant aside {{and told him that}} he would lose the election, and should {{withdraw}} to avoid embarrassment. Young argued that Grant was being heavily attacked by opponents, who were against the concept of a presidential third term. Young also criticized the handling of the campaign and told Grant that if he won the election, he would be indebted to the [...] "triumvirate". Grant felt that his Stalwart friends had been of great assistance in his election bid, and they deserved political patronage in his administration. Grant, nonetheless, listened to Young's advice and wrote a letter to J. Donald Cameron, authorizing his name to be withdrawn from the nomination contest after consultation with his other Stalwart backers. Upon hearing of his letter, Julia Grant was insistent that her husband should not withdraw his name from the contest. She said, [...] "If General Grant were not nominated, then let it be so, but he must not withdraw his name – no, never." [...] Young delivered the letter to the [...] "triumvirate" [...] in Chicago on May 31, but no action was taken to remove Grant's name.|$|E
500|$|The third single [...] "911 Is a Joke" [...] {{features}} Flavor Flav as {{the lead}} MC. He was given the idea by Chuck D to write the song. As Flav recalled, [...] "I went and got high and wrote the record. I went and got ripped, I went {{and got out of}} my mind, and I started speaking all kinds of crazy shit 'cos usually {{back in the days when}} I used to smoke, it used to broaden my ideas and everything". The humorous and satirical subject matter is reflected in its music video, which featured a severely injured Flav being mistreated by a remiss, overdue ambulance staff. Another Flavor Flav-solo track, the fifth single [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man", has lyrics advocating African-American self-reliance and denouncing welfare dependence. It also reflects on Flav's experiences with acquaintances from poor neighborhoods. He said of his inspiration for the song, [...] "I was in my Corvette riding from Long Island going to The Bronx. I <b>was</b> <b>slipping.</b> I was roasting. I mean I was smoked-out crazy. And everybody kept asking me for stuff and yet nobody wanted to give me stuff. So then if anybody ever asked me for something I would be like, 'Yo, I can't do nothing for ya man.' Next thing you know I started to vibe on it: 'I can't do nothing for ya man,' um ahh um um ahh. So I went and told that to Chuck. Chuck was like, 'Record that shit man'". Writing of both tracks, music critic Tom Moon comments that Flav [...] "affects a tone of gimme-a-break sarcasm that is crucial to both tracks, and is welcome respite from Chuck D.'s assault". [...] "Can't Do Nuttin' for Ya Man" [...] was featured in the 1990 comedy film House Party.|$|E
