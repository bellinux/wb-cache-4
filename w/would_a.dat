5|$|Aggressive mimicry {{is a form}} of mimicry {{in which}} predators, parasites or parasitoids share similar signals, using a {{harmless}} model, allowing them to avoid being correctly identified by their prey or host. In its broadest sense, it could include various types of exploitation, as when an orchid exploits a male insect by mimicking a sexually receptive female (see pseudocopulation), but will here be restricted to forms of exploitation involving feeding. An alternative term Peckhamian mimicry (after George and Elizabeth Peckham) has been suggested, but is seldom used. The metaphor of a wolf in sheep's clothing can be used as an analogy, but with the caveat that mimics are not intentionally deceiving their prey. For example, indigenous Australians who dress up as and imitate kangaroos when hunting would not be considered aggressive mimics, nor <b>would</b> <b>a</b> human angler. Treated separately is molecular mimicry, which also shares some similarity; for instance a virus may mimic the molecular properties of its host, allowing it access to its cells.|$|E

5|$|Despite a {{relatively}} small mandate in terms of votes, some socialists {{took to the streets}} to free political prisoners, without waiting for the government to do so officially. There were claims of an imminent socialist or anarchist takeover. The right had firmly believed, at all levels, that they would win. Portela <b>would,</b> <b>a</b> year later, claim that Gil-Robles and General Francisco Franco had approached him within days to the election to propose a military takeover. Portela resigned, even before a new government could be formed. However, the Popular Front, which had proved an effective election tool, did not translate into a Popular Front government. Largo Caballero and other elements of the political left were not prepared to work with the republicans, although they did agree to support much of the proposed reforms. Manuel Azaña Díaz was called upon to form a government, but would shortly replace Zamora as president. The right began to conspire as to how to best overthrow the republic, rather than taking control of it.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being well}} {{received}} by fans and critically acclaimed and nominated in 1983 for a BAFTA and Golden Globe as best original score, {{and the promise}} of a soundtrack album from Polydor Records in the end titles of the film, the release of the official soundtrack recording was delayed for over a decade. There are two official releases of the music from Blade Runner. In light of the lack of a release of an album, the New American Orchestra recorded an orchestral adaptation in 1982 which bore little resemblance to the original. Some of the film tracks would, in 1989, surface on the compilation Vangelis: Themes, but not until the 1992 release of the Director's Cut version <b>would</b> <b>a</b> substantial amount of the film's score see commercial release.|$|E
5|$|On October 18, 2013, Charlene Johnson, the {{minister}} responsible for trade, along with Fisheries minister Keith Hutchings {{announced that the}} government supported the agreement in principle for CETA, that had been announced early that day. The ministers said the trade agreement <b>would</b> <b>a</b> game changer for the fishing industry. The agreement would eliminate MPRs for the European Union {{three years after the}} ratification of the deal, which is expected to occur in 2015. In return for eliminating minimum processing requirement, high tariffs and import restrictions on almost all fish would be eliminated on the first day that CETA comes into effect. Currently only 13.1 per cent of seafood is duty-free. But by 2022, all seafood would be 100 per cent duty-free. Following the conclusion of the CETA negotiations Dunderdale said that other provinces and the federal government had been pressuring her to accept a deal that would eliminate minimum processing requirements on fish right away, in exchange for concessions on tariffs later. Dunderdale said they refused that deal and were eventually able to negotiate the current arrangement. Her government also felt that eliminating MPRs was a safe trade away because they did not feel European countries could compete with Newfoundland and Labrador fish plants, due to higher operating costs in those countries.|$|E

5|$|Raglan Castle {{was built}} in several phases, initial work {{occurring}} in the 1420s and 1430s, a major phase in the 1460s, with various alterations and additions {{at the end of}} the 16th century. The castle {{was built in}} stone, initially pale sandstone from Redbrook, and later Old Red Sandstone, with Bath Stone used for many of the detailed features. Like similar properties of the period, the castle of the 1460s was almost certainly designed to be approached and entered in a particular way, maximising the aesthetic and political value of the fortification. At Raglan, the design highlighted the Great Tower: a typical senior visitor would ride through Raglan village, and first the tower and then the rest of the castle would appear suddenly over the slight rise on the hill. A visitor would have needed to circle the Great Tower and the moat, before coming in through the gatehouse, into the Pitched Stone Court, around the edge of the communal hall, before reaching the previously hidden, and more refined, inner Fountain Court. Only then <b>would</b> <b>a</b> privileged guest be able to enter the Great Tower itself, overlooking the Herbert family's own chambers. Many less senior visitors or servants would never have entered this far, seeing only the external elements of the castle, but perhaps having been impressed by the outside of the Great Tower as they arrived.|$|E
5|$|The game's setting {{stemmed from}} the idea of players being able to create and control a group of obedient creatures. The Shapers and the world of Geneforge were the result of Vogel imagining how <b>would</b> <b>a</b> being possess such power and how would they use it. The game's setting, a mixture of science fiction and fantasy, differs from the pure science fiction setting the game had been envisioned as. Vogel had {{difficulties}} balancing gameplay with the powerful directed-energy weapons players would expect to use in a science fiction game. Sales exceeded the developer's expectations, despite fears that the departure from Spiderweb's Avernum series would deter players. Geneforge received a positive reception from reviewers, despite the quality of the graphics being rated as poor and the game containing one piece of music, the title theme. The plot and setting were praised by reviewers for uniqueness and detail.|$|E
5|$|The {{next step}} is to apply hair. The hair can either be done in one of two ways; wigging, rooting or microrooting. when rooting hair is added 1-4 hair strands per plug. When microrooting, hair is added strand by strand. This can take up to 30 or more hours per head. Once the hair is finished, the {{original}} vinyl body is weighted with a soft stuffed body filled with pellets/fine glass beads/fiberfill.The weight corresponds with its age to achieve a real effect. Various additions also can be added to give the doll an even more life like appearance. Reborns heads are often weighted, so that owners have to support the head like one <b>would</b> <b>a</b> real newborn. Purchasers can have magnets attached inside the mouth or head for attaching a pacifier or hair bows. Electronic devices that mimic a heart beat, or make the chest rise and fall to simulate breathing are common. Reborns can come with an umbilical cord, baby fat, heat packs to make the reborn warm to the touch, or voice boxes that mimic infant sounds. For preemie dolls, they may come in incubators with a breathing apparatus attached to their nose.|$|E

5|$|The {{results of}} N-body {{simulations}} {{have shown that}} the stars can follow unusual paths through the cluster, often forming loops and often falling more directly toward the core than <b>would</b> <b>a</b> single star orbiting a central mass. In addition, due to interactions with other stars that result in an increase in velocity, some of the stars gain sufficient energy to escape the cluster. Over long periods of time this will result in a dissipation of the cluster, a process termed evaporation. The typical time scale for the evaporation of a globular cluster is 1010 years. In 2010 it became possible to directly compute, star by star, N-body simulations of a globular cluster over the course of its lifetime.|$|E
