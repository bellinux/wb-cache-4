50|$|Kerilia jerdonii is a sea snake of the Bay of Bengal. Glory of Bengal cone (Conus bengalensis) is {{just one}} of the seashells which can be photographed along beaches of the Bay of Bengal. An {{endangered}} species, the olive ridley sea turtle can survive because of the nesting grounds made available at the Gahirmatha Marine Wildlife Sanctuary, Gahirmatha Beach, Odisha, India. Marlin, barracuda, skipjack tuna, (Katsuwonus pelamis), yellowfin tuna, Indo-Pacific humpbacked dolphin (Sousa chinensis), and Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera edeni) are a few of the marine animals. Bay of Bengal hogfish (Bodianus neilli) is a type of <b>wrass</b> which live in turbid lagoon reefs or shallow coastal reefs. Schools of dolphins can be seen, whether they are the bottle nose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata) or the spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris). Tuna and dolphins usually reside in the same waters. In shallower and warmer coastal waters the Irrawaddy dolphins (Orcaella brevirostris) can be found.|$|E

To further our understanding of this abnormality, a substudy was conducted wherein side swimmers and normally swimming fish were selectively sampled from each WRAS and growth perfor-mance (length, weight), processing attributes (fillet yield, visceral index, ventrum [i. e., thickness of the ventral “belly flap”] index), blood gas and chemistry parameters, and swim bladder morphol-ogy and positioning were compared.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a 2 month {{study of the}} patterns of abundance, feeding pressure, diet and feeding selectivity in corallivorous tubelip <b>wrasses</b> (Labridae), rarely studied, yet widespread and abundant group of corallivores on Indo-Pacific coral reefs. The relative abundance and feeding pressure of corallivorous <b>wrasses</b> and butterflyfishes (Chaetodontidae) in Kimbe Bay, Papua New Guinea, were compared. Overall, tubelip <b>wrasses</b> were {{more than twice as}} abundant as corallivorous butterflyfishes and accounted for three times as many feeding bites on corals. The three most abundant tubelip <b>wrasses</b> (yellowtail tubelip Diproctacanthus xanthurus, Allen's tubelip Labropsis alleni and the tubelip wrasse Labrichthys unilineatus) were all obligate corallivores taking > 97 % of bites from the surface of live corals. Labropsis alleni and D. xanthurus were highly selective, consuming preferred prey species in proportions significantly higher than expected given their availability. In contrast, L. unilineatus was fairly non-selective and consumed most corals in direct accordance with their availability. As coral predators, tubelip <b>wrasses</b> are highly comparable to coral-feeding butterflyfishes in the coral species consumed, range of dietary specialization and their reliance on live coral. Tubelip <b>wrasses,</b> however, may supersede butterflyfishes as the predominant corallivorous family in some Indo-Pacific locations, and coral-feeding tubelip <b>wrasses</b> are likely to be severely affected by coral decline...|$|R

40|$|DOCTORAL DISSERTATION IN PSYCHOLOGY ABSTRACT Guldberg-Kjär, Taina (2013). ADHD {{in old age}} - Self-rated {{symptoms}} and Clinical information from a Population-Based Swedish Sample Aged 65 and older. Department of Psychology. University of Gothenburg, Sweden. Our knowledge of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has increased in recent years. However, given sparse information about its course and manifestations in later life the overall aim of the thesis was to explore {{the frequency with which}} elderly individuals report childhood and current symptoms that may indicate a history of ADHD. The more specific aims were: 1) to investigate whether gender, age, marital status, number of employments, educational level, perceived problems in childhood, self-reported health and memory were significantly associated with childhood and current ADHD symptoms, 2) to compare scales capturing ADHD symptoms for older individuals’ self-reports about childhood and current ADHD symptomatology and relating these results to the DSM-IV ADHD criteria, and 3) to analyse daily functioning, past psychiatric history, family psychiatric history and overall health history in older individuals meeting criteria for late life ADHD and to illustrate typical life courses through case reports. Study I The 25 -item Wender Utah Rating Scale was administered in a population-based sample of 2500 persons aged 65 to 80 to study the prevalence of self-rated childhood ADHD. Demographics, self-ratings of problems in childhood, current health and memory were also investigated. A total of 1599 individuals participated corresponding to a response rate of 64 %. The prevalence rate was 3, 3 % using a cut off score of 36 or more in the WURS-scale. Men rated significantly more ADHD symptoms. Those reporting more childhood ADHD symptoms also claimed general problems in childhood as well as worse current health. In Study II we examined the persistence of ADHD symptomatology across the lifespan by comparing older individuals’ self-reports about current ADHD {{symptoms and}} childhood symptoms. Based on the WURS scores (below and above 36) in Study I, two sub-samples were randomly drawn, each with 30 individuals who were clinically worked-up using the Wender Riktad ADHD Symtom Skala (<b>WRASS).</b> Our finding suggests a persistence of self-reported ADHD symptoms over the entire lifespan. In Study III we compared different scales capturing ADHD symptoms for self-reports about childhood and current ADHD symptomatology. We also related these reports to the DSM-IV ADHD criteria using the <b>WRASS</b> and Barkley Scales. The results support the idea of life long persistence of ADHD symptoms. In Study IV we explored problems in daily functioning, past psychiatric history, family psychiatric history, and overall health history in elderly individuals reporting childhood ADHD symptomatology. The Barkley Scales and a clinical interview were used. Three individuals were selected for in depthinterviews about their lifetime experiences and functioning. Our main finding was that of significantly more childhood and current problems in daily functioning in most domains of daily life, and more of past psychiatric history among those reporting more childhood ADHD symptoms. Conclusions: Our findings support the idea that ADHD symptoms may remain across the lifespan although this claim only can be fully confirmed by a longitudinal study design. Future research is therefore needed to identify factors that can alleviate the life span burden of ADHD.

40|$|Labroides dimidiatus, is one {{of several}} species of cleaner wrasses found on coral reefs from Eastern Africa and the Red Sea to French Polynesia, for the first time from Iran (Persian Gulf, Kish Island). Like other cleaner <b>wrasses,</b> it eats parasites and dead tissue off larger fishes’ skin in a mutualistic relationship that {{provides}} food and protection for the wrasse, and considerable health benefits for the other fishes. Some fish mimic cleaner <b>wrasses.</b> For example, a species of blenny called Aspidontus taeniatus has evolved the same behavior to tear small pieces of flesh from bigger fish. Cleaner <b>wrasses</b> are usually found at cleaning stations. Cleaning stations are occupied by different units of cleaner <b>wrasses,</b> such as a group of youths, a pair of adults, or a group of females accompanied by a dominant male. When visitors come near the cleaning stations, the cleaner <b>wrasses</b> greet the visitors by performing a dance-like motion in which they move their rear up and down.  The visitors are referred to as "clients". Blue streak cleaner <b>wrasses</b> clean to consume ectoparasites on client fish for food.

50|$|A {{significant}} parasite of bluehead <b>wrasses</b> is the intracellular myxozoan Kudoa ovivora, {{which can}} be found in the ovaries of female bluehead <b>wrasses.</b> Infected eggs are sterile and are also larger than uninfected eggs, and contain more organic and inorganic material. This implies the parasite causes a shift in resources from the mother to the eggs and decreases the fitness of the mother. Infected bluehead <b>wrasses</b> have been found to change sex earlier than uninfected females, possibly in response to the parasite.|$|R

Often, these <b>wrasses,</b> alone with many other Red Sea <b>wrasses,</b> crack sea urchins (echinoids) by carrying them to a rock in their mouths and striking them against a rock by moving their heads in sideways, brisk movements.|$|R
