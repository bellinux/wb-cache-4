5|$|Van Nistelrooy {{took the}} first penalty for Manchester United, {{in front of the}} United fans, and sent Lehmann the wrong way to give United the early advantage. Lauren then {{converted}} the next penalty for Arsenal, before Scholes stepped up to take United's second, only to see it saved by Lehmann, diving low to his right. The next six penalties were all scored – Ljungberg, Van Persie and Cole for Arsenal, Ronaldo, Rooney and Keane for Manchester United – leaving Vieira with the opportunity to win the FA Cup for his team. Although Carroll guessed the correct way to dive, Vieira's kick <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>out</b> of his reach, giving Arsenal their 10th FA Cup.|$|E

She <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>out</b> of Guadeloupe. However, {{she may have been}} the same Constance that Circe had earlier captured off the coast of Spain. The Admiralty took her in as the schooner Maria.|$|E

2500|$|In his {{biography}} of the comic, scholar of Mexican culture Jeffrey M. Pilcher views Cantinflas {{as a metaphor for}} [...] "the chaos of Mexican modernity", a modernity that <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>out</b> of reach for the majority of Mexicans: [...] "His nonsense language eloquently expressed the contradictions of modernity as 'the palpitating moment of everything that wants to be that which it cannot be'." [...] Likewise, [...] "Social hierarchies, speech patterns, ethnic identities, and masculine forms of behavior all crumbled before his chaotic humor, to be reformulated in revolutionary new ways." ...|$|E
2500|$|When he <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>out</b> {{of college}} Rodgers worked as musical {{director}} for Lew Fields. Among the stars he accompanied were Nora Bayes and Fred Allen. Rodgers was considering quitting show business altogether to sell children's underwear, {{when he and}} Hart finally broke through in 1925. They wrote the songs for a benefit show presented by the prestigious Theatre Guild, called The Garrick Gaieties, and the critics found the show fresh and delightful. Only meant to run one day, the Guild knew they had a success and allowed it to re-open later. The show's biggest hit — the song that Rodgers believed [...] "made" [...] Rodgers and Hart — was [...] "Manhattan". The two were now a Broadway songwriting force.|$|E
2500|$|He {{had played}} only six {{first-class}} games {{when he got}} picked for the Pakistan camp out of the blue. Waqar says [...] "I remember Imran was not feeling well at the time, and was not present at the camp. Luckily the Super Wills Cup was going on, {{and there was a}} match between United Bank and Delhi XI. Saleem Jaffar got injured, and I got the opportunity to play that game. Imran watched me on TV, and actually came to the ground to watch the end of the game. The very next day, he met me and told me that I will be going to Sharjah next month. Just meeting Imran at the time was enough of an experience for me, but for him to notify me of my selection <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>out</b> of this world." ...|$|E

60|$|It began away up in Sullivan County, {{where so}} many rivers and so much trouble begins--or begin; how would you say that?

60|$|This was {{the book}} which nearly {{everybody}} had brought on board. It <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>out,</b> and had caught an instant favor, which swelled later to a tidal wave. It depicted a heroic girl in every trying circumstance of mediaeval life, and gratified the perennial passion {{of both sexes}} for historical romance, while it flattered woman's instinct of superiority by the celebration of her unintermitted triumphs, ending in a preposterous and wholly superfluous self-sacrifice.|$|E

He couldn't resist an affable nod to Bab and Betty, for they stood under the maple-tree, and the memory of their circulating library made him forget his dignity in his gratitude.|$|E
