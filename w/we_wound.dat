When the {{characters}} did go off the ship, the worlds all had Earth atmosphere and coloring because they could not afford to design alien worlds. [...] "I didn't want to go to Yucca Flats every other episode and transform it into Bizarro World by making the sky orange", recalled Whedon. As Meyer recalled: [...] "I think in the end the feel was that <b>we</b> <b>wound</b> up using a lot of places or exteriors that just felt too Western and we didn't necessarily want to go that way; but at some point, it just became the lesser of two evils—what could we actually create in three days?" ...|$|E
500|$|A {{decade after}} Allegros premiere, after {{learning}} of his fatal cancer, Hammerstein {{returned to the}} musical, hoping to correct its flaws, {{but he did not}} complete the project. [...] While recording an oral history tape for Columbia University, Hammerstein stated, [...] "I intended Dick to write music for it [...] but <b>we</b> <b>wound</b> up reciting the chorus instead... I'm not blaming anyone, because we all accepted it, we all collaborated... but it was a mistake." [...] Rodgers later stated that the show was [...] "too preachy, which was the one fault that Oscar had, if any," [...] and [...] "othing to be ashamed of, certainly". [...] Rodgers further defended the play, [...] "The comments we made on the compromises demanded by success, {{as well as some of}} the satiric side issues—hypochondria, the empty cocktail party—still hold." ...|$|E
500|$|Jeff Bhasker, {{one of the}} song's producers, {{explained}} the track's roots as it [...] "came {{in the middle of}} the process of putting together the album". He further elaborated; [...] "We were just having a jam session, tracking some things, and Bruno started playing this groove and making up something on the spot; we all thought it was pretty good. <b>We</b> <b>wound</b> up working a long time on that, trying to get it just right." [...] "Locked Out of Heaven" [...] began as a [...] "cha-cha-style duet, à la Santana's [...] "Smooth"." [...] Ronson asked the Dap-Kings to collaborate on the track in order to get a [...] "crisply syncopated, locked-in groove." [...] Regarding the song, Mars says [...] "Man, there's a good pocket on this song right now. Let's keep it going." [...] He also mentioned that it took a long time to create it, commenting [...] "People didn't see us going at each other's throats in the studio and pulling out our hair." [...] He added, [...] "Trying to get these drums right and figure out a bass line." [...] Lawrence believes the lack of [...] "heavy hitting drums" [...] and the presence of a small guitar solo allows the song to be carried by Mars.|$|E

[...] He wrote in his diary, [...] "We were advanced pretty near to them ... when they discovered us; whereupon I ordered my company to fire ... Company ... received the whole Fire of the French, during the greatest Part of the Action, which only lasted a Quarter of an Hour, before the Enemy was routed. [...] We killed Mr. de Jumonville, the commander ... also nine others; <b>we</b> <b>wounded</b> one, and made Twenty-one Prisoners".|$|R
500|$|Bill Fagerbakke voiced SpongeBob's best friend, a starfish named Patrick Star in the episode. He {{auditioned for}} the role after Kenny had been cast as SpongeBob. [...] Fagerbakke said, [...] "Steve is such a lovely guy, and I had {{absolutely}} no feeling for the material whatsoever." [...] He described his experience in the audition, saying [...] "I was just going in for another audition, and I {{had no idea what}} was in store there in terms of the remarkable visual wit and really the kind of endearing child-like humanity in the show. I couldn't pick that up from the audition material at all. I was just kind of perfunctorially trying to give the guy what he wanted." [...] For the part of Squidward, Hillenburg originally had Mr. Lawrence in mind {{for the role}}. Lawrence worked with Hillenburg and Drymon before on Rocko's Modern Life, so while working on the episode, Hillenburg invited him to audition for all the characters. Drymon said, [...] "We were showing Doug the storyboard, and he started reading back to us in his Tony the Tiger/Gregory Peck voice. It was really funny, and <b>we</b> <b>wound</b> up having SpongeBob use a deep voice when he entered the Krusty Krab for the first time." [...] Hillenburg decided to give Lawrence the part of the series villain, Plankton, instead.|$|E
500|$|While Hillenburg, Derek Drymon, and Tim Hill {{were writing}} the pilot [...] "Help Wanted", Hillenburg was also {{conducting}} auditions to find voices {{for the show}} characters. He had created the character of SpongeBob with Tom Kenny, in which he utilised Kenny's and other people's personalities to help create SpongeBob's personality. The voice of SpongeBob was originally used by Kenny for a minor female alligator character named Al in Rocko's Modern Life. Kenny forgot the voice initially as he created it only for that single use. Hillenburg, however, remembered {{it when he was}} coming up with SpongeBob and used a video clip of the episode to remind Kenny of the voice. Kenny says that SpongeBob's high pitched laugh was specifically aimed at being unique, stating that they wanted an annoying laugh in the tradition of Popeye and Woody Woodpecker. Hillenburg originally had Mr. Lawrence for the role of voicing Squidward. Drymon said [...] "We knew Doug from Rocko, where he was a storyboard director and where he also did the voice of Filburt. We were showing Doug the storyboard, and he started reading back to us in his Tony the Tiger/Gregory Peck voice. It was really funny, and <b>we</b> <b>wound</b> up having SpongeBob use a deep voice when he entered the Krusty Krab for the first time." [...] Hillenburg loved the voice and decided to let Lawrence play a variety of incidental characters, including Plankton.|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} season, the writing staff used {{most of the}} story ideas that were in Hillenburg's series bible and they had {{problems}} on how to generate new ideas. At one point, the writing staff went to the beach for inspiration for a possible episode. However, the day [...] "was overcast and cold, so we [...] {{had to stay in}} the car." [...] Drymon said [...] "We didn't come up with too many ideas that day." [...] Story editor Peter Burns left, and the crew had Merriwether Williams to overtake. Hillenburg said to Williams that [...] "it was her responsibility to get us [...] to come up with new ideas." [...] Drymon said [...] " [...] is a tall order." [...] Williams gave Drymon a book called Zen in the Art of Writing, written by Ray Bradbury, that catalogs a collection of essays about writing processes. One of the ways in the book to inspire plots was [...] "to write nouns that interested him [...] on a note card and hang them in his office. He felt just having the word in his eyesight would get his mind working." [...] Williams took this scheme and made it into [...] "a writing exercise." [...] In writing meetings, the staff would all enumerate 10 nouns on strips of paper and place them in a hat. The hat would be passed throughout and a writer would have a limited time to spawn an idea based on the noun he wrote. Drymon said [...] "It would almost always start a discussion, and <b>we</b> <b>wound</b> up getting a lot of episodes out of it." [...] Furthermore, Drymon said that Williams [...] "really came up with a great addition to the process." ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{impossible}} to express the fright, the screaming and yelling of those wretches upon this first volley. We killed six of them, and wounded eleven or twelve, I mean as we knew of; for, as they stood thick, and the small shot, as we called it, scattered among them, we had reason to believe <b>we</b> <b>wounded</b> more that stood farther off, for our small shot was made of bits of lead and bits of iron, heads of nails, and such things as our diligent artificer, the cutler, helped us to.|$|R

We called each other to hang out. Somehow <b>we</b> <b>wound</b> up in the studio. RZA had a couple of beats. He played them for me. I got on both of them. The other one never came out.

60|$|I {{can neither}} tell how many we killed nor how many <b>we</b> <b>wounded</b> at this broadside, but sure such a fright and hurry never were seen among such a multitude; there were {{thirteen}} or fourteen of their canoes split and overset in all, {{and the men}} all set a-swimming: the rest, frightened out of their wits, scoured away {{as fast as they}} could, taking but little care to save those whose boats were split or spoiled with our shot; so I suppose that many of them were lost; and our men took up one poor fellow swimming for his life; above an hour after they were all gone.|$|R

[...] On August 14, Burt Alvord returned to Tombstone; he said none of the posse could even see the outlaws during the fighting. He explained they had buried Robson because the terrain was rough, the posse lost three of their horses, and they didn't have a wagon to transport the body. That same day, John Horton Slaughter, the former Cochise County sheriff; Bert Cogswell, William King, and two Mexican men, joined Leatherwood's posse, somewhere around Mulberry Ranch in western San Simon Valley, where they were resting their horses.|$|R
