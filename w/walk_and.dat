5|$|As a {{saprobic}} mushroom, or decomposer {{of organic}} material, Ravenel's stinkhorn {{can be found}} in almost any habitat that includes decaying wood. They are most often found growing in groups, though occasionally singly, on wood chips, rotten tree stumps or sawdust. They are common in urban flowerbeds, parks and lawns, as well as in meadows, cultivated areas and woods. The foul odor of the gleba attracts insects that <b>walk</b> <b>and</b> feed on the spore-bearing surface, and later disseminate the sticky spores to other locales.|$|E

Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft {{for more than a}} week.|$|E

5|$|Gameplay is turn-based, {{with each}} team moving in sequence, which is {{determined}} randomly, across two-dimensional terrain. During a single turn, a team can only move {{one of their}} worms (unless an item that allows the team to select their worm is used). Worms can <b>walk</b> <b>and</b> jump, as well as (when the proper items are available) swing by rope, parachute, teleport, and bungee. The objective of a traditional match is to defeat all opposing teams by killing their worms, although in the campaign some missions have other objectives such as collecting a specific crate.|$|E

40|$|Self-interacting <b>walks</b> <b>and</b> polygons on {{the simple}} cubic lattice undergo a {{collapse}} transition at the theta-point.

We prove that these <b>walks</b> <b>and</b> polygons have the same limiting free energy if the interactions between nearest-neighbour vertices are repulsive. The attractive interaction regime is investigated using Monte Carlo methods, and we find evidence that the limiting free energies are also equal here. In particular, this means that these models have the same theta-point, in the asymptotic limit.
