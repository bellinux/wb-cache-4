25|$|The {{book has}} three parts, each with seven {{chapters}}. Burgess {{has stated that}} the total of 21 chapters was an intentional nod {{to the age of}} 21 being recognised as a milestone in human maturation. The 21st chapter was omitted from the editions published in the United States prior to 1986. In the introduction to the updated American text (these newer editions include the missing 21st chapter), Burgess explains that when he first brought the book to an American publisher, he was told that U.S. audiences <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>go</b> for the final chapter, in which Alex sees the error of his ways, decides he has lost all energy for and thrill from violence and resolves to turn his life around (a moment of metanoia).|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{returned}} to Philadelphia from New York in August 1855 and testified {{in the trial}} of William Still and five dockworkers, charged by her master John Hill Wheeler with assault. They had aided her escape. She testified at length about having planned to gain freedom in the North, and said she chose of her own free will to leave with Still, and <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>go</b> back to slavery. She helped win acquittal for Still and three men, and reduced sentences for two others. State and local officials protected her after testimony, and she and her sons soon moved to Boston, where they settled. She married again there. Her son Isaiah Johnson served in the United States Colored Troops during the American Civil War.|$|E
500|$|Lewington's own {{assessment}} of the relationship is that: [...] "Maddy doesn't have anyone in her life that she can count on. Dan was her family and that's what hurt so bad. I guess to have Dan as a lover would mean that he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>go</b> away. She wouldn't have to share him. Dan loved Maddy sincerely {{which is why he}} didn't want to risk hurting her [...] than he already had. He was too messed up to be good for anyone and he knew it." ...|$|E

500|$|The first club from {{a country}} with a Pacific coast to reach a final was Universitario of Lima, Peru, who lost in 1972 against Independiente of Argentina. The {{following}} year, Independiente defeated Colo-Colo of Chile, another Pacific team, creating the myth that the trophy <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>go</b> to the west, giving birth to the saying, [...] "La Copa se mira y no se toca" [...] (...) [...] Unión Española became the third Pacific team to reach the final in 1975, although they also lost to Independiente. Atletico Nacional of Medellín, Colombia, won the Copa Libertadores in 1989, becoming the first nation with a Pacific coastline to win the tournament,. In 1990 and 1998 Barcelona Sporting Club, of Ecuador also made it to final but lost both finals to Olimpia and Vasco da Gama respectively.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Larry David. Kenny Kramer claimed that there {{actually}} was a [...] "Contest" [...] in which David and some friends of his took part, {{although he did not}} initially want to take part because he thought he could not win it. David won the contest. When David came up with using the idea for an episode of Seinfeld, he did not talk about it with Seinfeld for a considerable time, because he thought the episode was impossible for him to pitch. However, Seinfeld thought it was not offensive. The original script was not revealed until the night before the cast read-through. The first version written by David was not as clean as the one later broadcast. The note from the censor claimed that David should not use the word [...] "Masturbate". Julia Louis-Dreyfus thought that the episode <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>go</b> ahead due to the subject matter. Seinfeld decided {{it would be better to}} remove any references to what George actually did. Seinfeld claimed that what was noteworthy about [...] "The Contest" [...] was the [...] "Dovetailing" [...] of the stories. He claimed that it probably would have been possible to have used the word [...] "masturbation" [...] in the episode (it is notable that in [...] "The Ticket"—an earlier episode in the same season—George says [...] "you must have a good story otherwise it's just masturbation") although it would have probably ended up not being as funny. Part of the opening scene of the episode contains some of the script that was originally meant to be used in [...] "The Seinfeld Chronicles", the original pilot episode.|$|E
2500|$|According to Alex Webster, bassist of Cannibal Corpse, [...] "The gory {{lyrics are}} {{probably}} not, {{as much as}} people say, [...] from being mainstream. Like, 'death metal <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>go</b> into the mainstream because the lyrics are too gory?' I think it's really the music, because violent entertainment is totally mainstream." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Mr. Osprey,' {{said little}} Mr. Sparrow very earnestly, 'if I {{were in your}} place, I <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> hungry. No, Sir, I <b>never</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> hungry. And I {{certainly}} <b>never,</b> <b>never</b> <b>would</b> trouble any of my neighbors who wear feathers. I certainly would feel most happy if Old Mother Nature had given me what she has given you. Indeed I would.' ...|$|R

2500|$|After the loss, Poirier {{moved to}} fight in the Lightweight {{division}}. Poirier said that it was because weight cuts are distracting him from training. He also claimed that he <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>go</b> back to featherweight nor move up to welterweight. [...] "This is the division (lightweight) I'm going to win the belt at," [...] said Poirier in an interview.|$|E
2500|$|When an {{interviewer}} suggested her books portrayed a conservative world, Rowling replied, [...] "So I'm told repeatedly. The {{two groups of}} people who are constantly thanking me are Wiccans and boarding schools. And really, don't thank me. I'm not with either of them. New ageism leaves me completely cold, and [...] <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>go</b> to boarding school. I went to a comprehensive." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parry held German {{music and}} its traditions {{to be the}} {{pinnacle}} of music, and {{was a friend of}} German culture in general. He was, accordingly, certain that Britain and Germany <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>go</b> to war against each other, and was in despair when World War I broke out. In the words of the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: [...] "During the war he watched a life's work of progress and education being wiped away as the male population, particularly the new fertile generation of composing talent—of the Royal College, dwindled." ...|$|E
50|$|On 6 November 1944 the Biesbosch, a {{difficult}} to penetrate area, became the front between the German and allied forces. The Germans <b>would</b> almost <b>never</b> <b>go</b> {{into this area}} and as such it was ideal for hideouts for refugees.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure he does," [...] cried Miss Millet, with enthusiasm. [...] "Noble-hearted, simple men, who <b>would</b> {{probably}} <b>never</b> <b>go</b> {{wrong at}} all {{if it were not}} for their unsuspecting trustfulness and bad companions! Come, sit down, Dick. Tea is ready." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You exaggerate, sir," [...] said Geoffrey. [...] "It was you {{who won the}} {{concession}} and overcame all the initial difficulties, while we <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have <b>gone</b> so far without your assistance. Such a task {{would have been far}} beyond me alone." ...|$|R
2500|$|In the 1970s, Denver's onstage {{appearance}} included {{long blond}} hair and [...] "granny" [...] glasses. His embroidered shirts emblazoned with images commonly associated with the American West were created by the designer & appliqué artist Anna Zapp. His manager, Jerry Weintraub, insisted on {{a significant number of}} television appearances, including a series of half-hour shows in United Kingdom, despite Denver's protests at the time, [...] "I've had no success in Britain... I mean none." [...] Weintraub explained to Maureen Orth of Newsweek in December 1976, [...] "I knew the critics <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>go</b> for John. I had to get him to the people." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 1999, Biletnikoff's daughter, Tracey, {{was found}} strangled to death at age 20 in Redwood City, California. Tracey's boyfriend, Mohammed Haroon Ali, {{was convicted of}} first-degree murder in 2012 after admitting he strangled her with a T-shirt at a drug and alcohol {{treatment}} center during an argument over whether he had relapsed. He was sentenced to 55 years to life imprisonment. Biletnikoff called Ali an [...] "animal" [...] after the sentencing, and said his hatred for him <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>go</b> away. In 2015, Biletnikoff founded Tracey's Place of Hope in Loomis, California, a shelter for domestic violence victims and substance abuse treatment for females ages 14 to 18.|$|E
2500|$|In the end, the {{government}} did not have to use either of those procedures. As the parliamentary debate started, the left-wing opposition chose to withdraw all the amendments to allow for the vote to proceed. The [...] "filibuster" [...] was aborted because the opposition to the privatisation of Gaz de France appeared to lack support amongst the general population. It also appeared that this privatisation law could be used by the left-wing in the presidential election of 2007 as a political argument. Indeed, Nicolas Sarkozy, president of the Union pour un Mouvement Populaire (UMP – the right wing party), Interior Minister, former Finance Minister and former President, had previously promised that the share owned by the French government in Gaz de France <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>go</b> below 70%.|$|E

6000|$|... "I do." [...] He {{was very}} vehement. [...] "Had you not used me as you did, had you not lent a ready ear to lies, that whelp my brother <b>would</b> <b>never</b> have <b>gone</b> to such lengths, nor should I ever have afforded him the opportunity." ...|$|R

2500|$|Early {{theories}} {{concerning the}} nature of the lowest-mass stars and the hydrogen-burning limit suggested that a population I object with a mass less than 0.07 solar masses (...) or a population II object less than [...] <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>go</b> through normal stellar evolution and would become a completely degenerate star. The first self-consistent calculation of the hydrogen-burning minimum mass confirmed a value between 0.08 and 0.07 solar masses for population I objects. The discovery of deuterium burning down to 0.012solar masses and the impact of dust formation in the cool outer atmospheres of brown dwarfs in the late 1980s brought these theories into question. However, such objects were hard to find as they emit almost no visible light. Their strongest emissions are in the infrared (IR) spectrum, and ground-based IR detectors were too imprecise at that time to readily identify any brown dwarfs.|$|E
2500|$|British {{public opinion}} had been {{strongly}} opposed {{to war and}} rearmament {{at the beginning of}} the 1930s, although this began to shift by mid-decade. At a debate at Oxford University in 1933, a group of undergraduates passed a motion saying that they would not fight for King and country, which persuaded some in Germany that Britain <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>go</b> to war. Baldwin told the House of Commons that in 1933 he had been unable to pursue a policy of rearmament because of the strong pacifist sentiment in the country. In 1935, eleven million responded to the League of Nations [...] "Peace Ballot"by pledging support for the reduction of armaments by international agreement. On the other hand, the same survey also found that 58.7% of British voters favored [...] "collective military sanctions" [...] against aggressors, and public reaction to the Hoare-Laval Pact with Mussolini was extremely unfavorable. Even the left-wing of the pacifist movement quickly began to turn with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and many peace-balloters began signing up for the international brigades to fight Hitler's ally Francisco Franco. By the height of the Spanish conflict in 1937, the majority of young pacifists had modified their views to accept that war could be a legitimate response to aggression and fascism.|$|E
2500|$|He {{had a large}} temple {{built in}} his hayfield, a hundred feet long and sixty wide. Everybody had to pay a temple fee. Thor was the god most honoured there. It was rounded on the inside, like a vault, and there were windows and wall-hangings everywhere. The image of Thor stood in the center, with other gods on both sides. In front of them was an altar made with great skill and covered with iron on the top. On this {{there was to be}} a fire which <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>go</b> outthey called it sacred fire. On the altar was to lie a great armband, made of silver. The temple godi was to wear it on his arm at all gatherings, and {{everyone}} was to swear oaths on it whenever a suit was brought. A great copper bowl was to stand on the altar, and into it was to go all the blood which came from animals or men given to Thor. They called this sacrificial blood [...] and the sacrificial blood bowl [...] This blood was to be sprinkled over men and animals, and the animals that were given in sacrifice were to be used for feasting when sacrificial banquets were held. Men whom they sacrificed were to be cast into a pool which was outside by the door; they called it Blótkelda (Well of Sacrifice).|$|E

2500|$|On 21 August 1939, Papen {{presented}} the Turks with a diplomatic note {{that was almost}} an ultimatum threatening the cancellation of all arms contacts and for the Reich to impose economic sanctions if Turkey did not cease leaning towards joining the Anglo-French [...] "peace front". Papen approved of the German-Soviet nonaggression pact, sending Hitler a telegram congratulating him on his [...] "brilliant diplomatic victory" [...] as Papen believed that Britain and France <b>would</b> <b>never</b> <b>go</b> to war for Poland without the Soviet Union; accordingly he drew the conclusion that Germany could now invade Poland without fear of a world war. After the signing of German-Soviet non-aggression pact in Moscow on 24 August 1939, for a moment, the Turks considered giving in. However, the Turks recovered their nerve, and on 26 August 1939 Saracoğlu told Papen that Germany had broken every promise it had ever made to the Turks, {{and he did not}} care if Germany ceased trading with Turkey. On 29 August 1939, İnönü told Papen that Turkey was a sovereign country that nobody would dictate to, and observed that if the Germans did not want Turkish chrome, {{they did not have to}} buy it, with İnönü adding just whom the Germans would buy chrome from was an interesting question that he could not answer. The İnönü-Papen meeting of 29 August 1939 left the ambassador [...] "thoroughly uneasy" [...] and he left the meeting in [...] "acute perspiration" [...] as Germany needed Turkish chrome very badly. As Turkey was the only place in the world that the Germans could buy chrome from after the British blockade came into effect on 3 September 1939, the Turks had called the German bluff, and the threat of severing German-Turkish trade was not put into practice.|$|E
