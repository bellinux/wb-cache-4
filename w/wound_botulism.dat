40|$|Abstract. <b>Wound</b> <b>botulism</b> {{results from}} {{colonization}} of a contaminated wound by Clostridium botulinum and the anaerobic in situ {{production of a}} potent neurotoxin. Between 1943, when <b>wound</b> <b>botulism</b> was first recognized, and 1990, 47 laboratory-confirmed cases, mostly trauma-associated, were reported in the United States. Since 1990, wound botu-lism associated with injection drug use emerged as {{the leading cause of}} <b>wound</b> <b>botulism</b> in the United States; 210 of 217 cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between 1990 and 2002 were associated with drug injection. Despite the worldwide distribution of Clostridium botulinum spores, <b>wound</b> <b>botulism</b> has been reported only twice outside the United States, Europe, and Australia. However, <b>wound</b> <b>botulism</b> may go undiagnosed and untreated in many countries. We report two cases, both with type A toxin, from the Ecuadorian rain forest.

40|$|There {{are three}} main, {{naturally}} occurring, epidemiological types of botulism: food-borne, intestinal colonization (infant botulism) and <b>wound</b> <b>botulism.</b> The neurological {{signs and symptoms}} are {{the same for all}} three epidemiological types and may include respiratory paralysis. <b>Wound</b> <b>botulism</b> is caused by growth of cells and release of toxin in vivo, is associated with traumatic wounds and abscesses and has been reported in drug users, such as those injecting heroin or sniffing cocaine. Up to the end of 1999 there were no confirmed cases of <b>wound</b> <b>botulism</b> in the UK. Between the beginning of 2000 and the end of December 2002, there were 33 clinically diagnosed cases of <b>wound</b> <b>botulism</b> in the UK and Ireland.

40|$|Foodborne {{botulism}} occurred among inmates at 2 {{prisons in}} California in 2004 and 2005. In the fi rst outbreak, 4 inmates were hospitalized, 2 of whom required intubation. In the second event, 1 inmate required intubation. Pruno, an alcoholic drink made illicitly in prisons, was the novel vehicle for these cases. Foodborne botulism {{is a rare}} paralytic disease caused by ingestion of preformed botulinum toxin in food contaminated with Clostridium botulinum, an anaerobic, spore-forming bacterium that is ubiquitous in the environment. The other 2 main categories of botulism are infant botulism caused by intestinal colonization with C. botulinum and <b>wound</b> <b>botulism</b> caused by wound contamination with C. botulinum. In each of these latter categories, illness results from in situ production of botulinum toxin. In California, <b>wound</b> <b>botulism</b> caused by injection drug use has increased since 1994 (1). Of the 7 botulinum toxin types (A–G), types A, B, and E are associated with most human cases. Symptom onset generally occurs 12 – 36 hours after ingestion of contaminated food. Symptoms start as cranial nerve palsies and are followed by a symmetric descending flaccid paralysis {{that can lead to}} respiratory failure and death if respiratory support is not provided (2).
