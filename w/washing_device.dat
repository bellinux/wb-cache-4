Cashew nut production industries use its main waste, the CNS, as fuel, thus avoiding the need of sanitary landfill. Notice that burning is the best way of eliminating solid residues, for this process leads to a one thousand fold reduction in volume and, if performed under a well controlled mechanism, it may lead to a minimum of residues which may be extracted with the gaseous flow using cyclones and gas <b>washing</b> <b>devices.</b> This work discusses the use of a fluidized combustion chamber with air as its fluidizing agent (instead of sand), to properly burn the CNS.

40|$|To {{select a}} “no <b>wash</b> ” <b>device</b> for {{postoperative}} blood salvage in major prosthetic surgery, {{in order to}} become a routine procedure. To test whether the methodology and the device for such purpose are safe, user-friendly and MATERIALS AND METHODS Among the many “no <b>wash</b> ” <b>devices</b> in commerce, we considered the “DRENTECH SURGICAL” as the most suitable system manufactured by REDAX since: Once connected to the drainage, this system is completely closed and does not allow any manipulation from outside. The system can vary the suction strength in a very simple way (from- 25 to- 100 mmHg) It is equipped with a double filter: one of 120 microns on the collection chamber inlet, one with 40 microns built-in inside the reinfusion bag. It is equipped with a system (valve) to separate the buffy coat, during the blood transfer from the collection chamber to the reinfusion bag. The elimination of the buffy coat together with the presence of the built-in 40 microns filter has been considered particularly important since it allows to eliminate degenerated blood platelets, cellular debris and, above all, lipids coming from the medullary cavity of the bone, lipids contained and responsible for fat embolism and/or coagulopathy. The suction starts at least ten minutes after removing the pneumatic tourniquets, when used, and any time after washing the field of operation only with saline solution. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{acoustic}} separation {{method has}} great potential in many applications. First, {{it can be}} used as blood washing tool in open-heart surgery. In general, blood shed in the chest cavity during surgery, e.g. coronary bypass, is collected and returned to the patient via a filter. This blood is commonly contaminated by triglycerides from adipose tissue undergoing surgery. However, when autotransfusion is performed, millions of small lipid particles (lipid microemboli) pass straight through the filter and are introduced into the patient’s circulatory system, resulting in microembolisation of the capillary network in the bodily organs and subsequent local ischemic tissue damage. This becomes most obvious with regard to the brain. Elevated levels of cognitive dysfunction have been linked to lipid microembolisation of the brain. No dedicated methods to remove lipid microemboli are currently available. Autotransfusion is clearly preferred in spite of the aspects of microembolisation since returning the patient’s own blood reduces the strain on the blood banks. In addition, it eliminates transfusion-transmitted disease, immunologic reactions, and the risk of blood group incompatibility. In the case of extensive blood loss, blood <b>wash</b> <b>devices</b> based on centrifuges can be used. Second, the ability to separate suspended particles from the carrier medium also enables the continuous blood washing in situations where the blood plasma may be heavily contaminated by coagulation factors or inflammatory components. Third, the separation of microogranisms from blood flow other medium will facilitate the detection and identification of pathogens. Fourth, an acoustic separator can serve as a continuous flow particle filter to sort out particles based on size. Such a device will be useful in the characterization and production of nanomaterials.|$|R

Electrolyzed acid water (EAW) has a bactericidal effect, and an endoscopic <b>washing</b> <b>device</b> using EAW has been developed in Japan. To investigate the effect of EAW on the infectivity of viruses, we treated duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), which has similar properties to hepatitis B virus, with EAW, and determined the number of remaining infectious virus particles in a bioassay system. One-day-old Pekin ducks were inoculated with duck serum containing 105. 5 ID 50 DHBV; the serum had previously been incubated with 100 volumes of EAW or ion-exchanged water {{at room temperature for}} 7 min. DHBV infection was indicated by detection of viral DNA in duck serum samples 1 - 8 weeks after inoculation. Treatment of serum with EAW diminished DHBV infectivity whereas treatment with ion-exchanged water did not. The virus load was estimated to have been reduced to 101 - 103 ID 50 during the first 1 min and to < 100. 5 ID 50 in the next 6 min of incubation when compared with the control. Thus, EAW directly inactivates DHBV and its clinical application is recommended...|$|E

Currently, a reliable test to identify prions in blood samples is not available. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the possibility to remove scrapie prion protein (PrPSc) and infectivity from red blood cell (RBC) suspensions by a simple washing procedure using a cell separation and <b>washing</b> <b>device.</b> The extent of prion removal was assessed by Western blot, PMCA and infectivity bioassays. Our results revealed a substantial removal of infectious prions (>= 3 logs of infectivity) by all techniques used. These data suggest that a significant amount of infectivity present in RBC preparations can be removed by a simple washing procedure. This technology may lead to increased safety of blood products and reduce the risk of further propagation of prion diseases.

40|$|Described in {{this paper}} is a method of {{automatic}} washing for salt contaminated insulators. An average value of leakage current through {{the surface of the}} pilot insulator in a duration is measured, for this {{is a function of the}} quantity of salt adhered and its moisture content. In each cycle, the program signals give one by one the instructions on a start and an end of the integration of leakage current, a detection of the integrated value, a stop of the <b>washing</b> <b>device</b> and a reset of the integrator. The integrator consists of RC circuit and the main detecting part consists of the thyristor whose firing gate voltage is used as a reference value. If the integrator output rises above the firing gate voltage, the pulse signals are made in the signal conversion part at the same time that the thyristor turns on, which are distributed to the pump motor or the electromagnetic valve. Then the insulators on hot-line are washed all together in the appointed duration. Finally, by the various experiments this method was proved to have enough accuracy and reliability in practical use. The conclusions are summarized as follows. (1) An average value of leakage current is justified to be the detecting variable. (2) The RC circuit used as the integrator is proved to be easy in maintenance. (3) Because of the fairly short duration of the detecting action, the integrator is kept in a sufficiently safe condition under expected environment...|$|E

Encouraging hygiene education for People Living with HIV/AIDS in home based care services and additional {{support for the}} provision of water, sanitation, and hygiene services is recommended. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried during 2009 to assess water, sanitation status and hygiene practices and associated factors among People Living with HIV/AIDS in home based care services in Gondar city of Ethiopia. A systematic random sampling was used to select study subjects from 900 Home Based Care clients of People Living HIV/AIDS in Gondar city. Data was collected from 296 People Living with HIV/AIDS from two NGO’s in the city. For in-depth interview, four different categories were participated. Logistic regression and thematic framework analysis were performed for quantitative and qualitative part respectively. Results Two hundred ninety four subjects (72. 8 % (214) females and 27. 2 % (80) males) were studied. The mean age was 35. 8 [*]±[*] 8. 7 years. In the study, 42. 9 % (126) of the households have unimproved water status, 67 % (197) of the households have unimproved sanitation status, and 51. 7 % (152) of the households have poor hygienic practice.

40|$|Lignocellulosic {{biomass is a}} {{renewable}} resource for sustainable production of biofuels and chemicals. Syngas fermentation, a hybrid process integrating the thermochemical (i. e. gasification of feedstock to syngas) and biochemical (i. e. microbial fermentation of syngas) conversions, has been considered as a promising technology for production of lignocellulosic-biomass-derived ethanol. The challenge to commercialize syngas fermentation, though, is to enhance the gas-to-liquid mass transfer rate due to the low solubilities of carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H 2) in an energy-efficient manner. Conventional suspended-growth bioreactors, such as continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and bubble column reactor (BCR), suffer from inefficient mass transfer and unwanted cell washout at high dilution rate, resulting to low productivities. The present study explored the feasibility of applying three innovative attached-growth bioreactor systems, hollow fiber membrane biofilm reactor (HFM-BR), monolithic biofilm reactor (MBR) and rotating packed bed biofilm reactor (RPB-BR), in continuous syngas fermentation, {{in order to enhance}} mass transfer of CO and to maximize ethanol production, by optimizing selected operational parameters. The highest ethanol productivity of HFM-BR, MBR and RPB-BR was achieved at 3. 44 g/L/day, 2. 35 g/L and 6. 70 g/L/day with optimized fermentation operational condition, respectively. HFM-BR showed the highest CO kLa (1096. 2 hour- 1) among the three bioreactor systems; however, the costly membrane and biofouling issue are the drawbacks to conduct continuous syngas fermentation with high ethanol productivity for extended period of time. MBR showed modest performance of CO mass transfer rate and ethanol productivity, but it has inherent advantages such as high mechanical strength and less biofouling problem. With installation of an in-situ <b>washing</b> <b>device,</b> the microchannel-clogging problem could potentially be resolved, indicating its capability of extended periods of continuous fermentation. RPB-BR gave the highest ethanol productivity with a simple mechanical design, inexpensive packing media and stable operation. The present study demonstrated the great potential of attached-growth bioreactors as efficient systems to obtain syngas fermentation with high productivity of ethanol, making cellulosic ethanol biorefinery move one step forward to technical and economic feasibility. Ultimately, it is believed that this study will contribute to our nation 2 ̆ 7 s independence from petroleum fuels...|$|E

40|$|Background: With the advents of new {{processing}} {{techniques and}} new graft survival theories in fat grafting, the question is: Which processing technique is of preference? This study systematically reviewed literature regarding current techniques for processing fat grafts. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Cinahl, and Cochrane databases were searched until August 2015. Studies comparing different fat grafting processing techniques were included. Outcomes were viability of adipocytes, number of adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASC) and growth factors in vitro, volume {{and quality of}} the graft in animal studies, and satisfaction and volume retention in human studies. Results: Thirty-five studies were included. Adipocyte viability and ASC numbers were the best using the gauze/towel technique (permeability principle) compared to centrifugation. With regard to centrifugation, the pellet contained more ASCs compared to the middle layer. The animal studies' and patients' satisfaction results were not distinctive. The only study assessing volume retention in humans showed that a <b>wash</b> filter <b>device</b> performed significantly better than centrifugation. Conclusion: In this study, processing techniques using permeability principles proved superior to centrifugation (reinforced gravity principle) regarding viability and ASC number. Due to the variety in study characteristics and reported outcome variables, however, none of the processing techniques in this study demonstrated clinical evidence of superiority.

Droplet-based microfluidic techniques were exploited to generate oil droplets which were smoothly guided along a row of micropillars to repeatedly travel through three parallel laminar streams consisting of two polymers and a <b>washing</b> solution. <b>Devices</b> were prototyped in PDMS and generated highly monodisperse and stable 45 +/- 2 mu m sized polyelectrolyte microcapsules. A total of six layers of hydrogen bonded polyelectrolytes (3 bi-layers) were adsorbed on each droplet within < 3 minutes and a fluorescent intensity measurement confirmed polymer film deposition. AFM analysis revealed the thickness of each polymer layer to be approx. 2. 8 nm. Our design approach not only provides a faster and more efficient alternative to conventional LbL deposition techniques, but also achieves {{the highest number of}} polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) reported thus far using microfluidics.
