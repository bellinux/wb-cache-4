25|$|A typeII error {{occurs when}} the null {{hypothesis}} is false, but erroneously fails to be rejected. It is failing to assert what is present, a miss. A typeII error may be compared with a so-called false negative (where an actual 'hit' was disregarded by the test and seen as a 'miss') in a test checking for a single condition with a definitive result of true or false. A Type II error is committed when <b>we</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> believe a true alternative hypothesis.

2500|$|The philosopher {{of science}} Elliott Sober once argued {{along the same}} lines as Popper, tying {{simplicity}} with [...] "informativeness": The simplest theory is the more informative, {{in the sense that it}} requires less information to a question. He has since rejected this account of simplicity, purportedly because it fails to provide an epistemic justification for simplicity. He now believes that simplicity considerations (and considerations of parsimony in particular) do not count unless they reflect something more fundamental. Philosophers, he suggests, may have made the error of hypostatizing simplicity (i.e., endowed it with a sui generis existence), when it has meaning only when embedded in a specific context (Sober 1992). If <b>we</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> justify simplicity considerations on the basis of the context in which we use them, we may have no non-circular justification: [...] "Just as the question 'why be rational?' may have no non-circular answer, the same may be true of the question 'why should simplicity be considered in evaluating the plausibility of hypotheses?'" ...|$|E

I do not know what this is for, says he, but I see that each part of it is fitted to the rest, I admire the workman in the details of his work, and I am quite certain that all these wheels only work together in this fashion for some common end which I cannot perceive. Let us compare the special ends, the means, the ordered relations of every kind, then let us listen to the inner voice of feeling; what healthy mind can reject its evidence? Unless the eyes are blinded by prejudices, can they fail to see that the visible order of the universe proclaims a supreme intelligence? What sophisms must be brought together before <b>we</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> understand the harmony of existence and the wonderful co-operation of every part for the maintenance of the rest? ...|$|E
2500|$|The term [...] "Being-with" [...] {{refers to}} an ontological {{characteristic}} of the human being, that it is always already with others of its kind. This assertion is to be understood not as a factual statement about an individual, {{that he or she}} is at the moment in spatial proximity to one or more other individuals. [...] Rather it is a statement about the being of every human, that in the structures of its being-in-the-world one finds an implicit reference to other humans. We all live with others, and in fact we could not live without them. Humans have been called (by others, not by Heidegger) [...] "ultrasocial" [...] and [...] "obligatorily gregarious." [...] Without others of our kind we could not survive. Heidegger, from his phenomenological perspective, calls this feature of human life [...] "Being-with" [...] (Mitsein), and says it is essential to being human. We are inauthentic when <b>we</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> recognize how much and in what ways how we think of ourselves and how we habitually behave is influenced by our social surroundings. We are authentic when we pay attention to that influence and decide for ourselves whether to go along with it or not. Living entirely without such influence, however, is not an option.|$|E

2500|$|The second {{formulation}} of the categorical imperative is the Formula of Humanity, which Kant arrives at by considering the motivating ground of the categorical imperative. Because the moral law is necessary and universal, its motivating ground must have absolute worth (4:428). Were we to find something with such absolute worth, an end in itself, {{that would be the}} only possible ground of a categorical imperative. Kant asserts that, “a human being and generally every rational being exists as an end in itself.” (4:428) The corresponding imperative, the Formula of Humanity, commands that “you use humanity, whether in your own persona or in the person of any other, always {{at the same time as}} an end, never merely as a means.” (4:429) [...] When we treat others merely as means to our discretionary ends, we violate a perfect duty. However, Kant thinks that we also have an imperfect duty to advance the end of humanity. For example, making a false promise to another person in order to achieve the end of getting some money treats their rational nature as a mere means to one’s selfish end. This is, therefore, a violation of a perfect duty. By contrast, it is possible to fail to donate to charity without treating some other person as a mere means to an end, but in doing so <b>we</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> advance the end of humanity, thereby violating an imperfect duty.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 June 1935, Ribbentrop {{arrived in}} London. The talks began on Tuesday, 4 June 1935, at the Admiralty office with Ribbentrop heading the German {{delegation}} and Simon the British delegation. Ribbentrop, who {{was determined to}} succeed at his mission, no matter what, began his talks by stating the British could either accept the 35:100 ratio as [...] "fixed and unalterable" [...] by the weekend, or the German delegation would go home, and the Germans would build their navy up to any size they wished. Simon was visibly angry with Ribbentrop's behaviour: [...] "It is not usual to make such conditions {{at the beginning of}} negotiations". Simon walked out of the talks. On 5 June 1935, a change of opinion came over the British delegation. In a report to the British Cabinet, it was [...] "definitely of the opinion that, in our own interest, we should accept this offer of Herr Hitler's while it is still open.... If we now refuse to accept the offer for the purposes of these discussions, Herr Hitler will withdraw the offer and Germany will seek to build to a higher level than 35 per cent.... Having regard to past history and to Germany's known capacity to become a serious naval rival of this country, we may have cause to regret it if <b>we</b> <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> take this chance...". Also, on 5 June, during talks between Sir Robert Craigie, the British Foreign Office's naval expert and chief of the Foreign Office's American Department and Ribbentrop's deputy, Admiral Karl-Georg Schuster, the Germans conceded that the 35:100 ratio would take the form of tonnage ratios, and the Germans would more or less build their tonnage up to whatever the British tonnage was in various warship categories. On the afternoon of that same day, the British Cabinet voted to accept the 35:100 ratio, and Ribbentrop was informed of the Cabinet's acceptance in the evening.|$|E
