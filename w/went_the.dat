Woodhouse made his debut for Mansfield Town on 24 January in a Conference National match against Lewes. Mansfield won 1–0. Matt Scriven was Woodhouse's next opponent in the ring on 29 March at Bramall Lane. The fight <b>went</b> <b>the</b> distance of six rounds and Woodhouse was given the decision over Scriven. His first professional loss as a boxer was on 25 April at Ulster Hall, in Belfast at the hands of Jay Morris. The fight <b>went</b> <b>the</b> distance, but Woodhouse lost 37–36 on points over six rounds. Mansfield manager David Holdsworth hoped Woodhouse would stay at the club, but on 18 June, he joined Conference North team Harrogate Town. On 27 November, he defeated Dean Hickman by TKO in round 6. This was Woodhouse's first fight in the light-welterweight division, having dropped down from welterweight.|$|E

5|$|Before {{his final}} {{undergraduate}} year at McMaster, Innis spent a summer {{teaching at the}} Northern Star School in the frontier farming community of Landonville near Vermilion, Alberta. The experience gave him {{a sense of the}} vastness of Canada. He also learned about Western grievances over high interest rates and steep transportation costs. In his final undergraduate year, Innis focused on history and economics. He kept in mind a remark made by history lecturer W.S. Wallace that the economic interpretation of history was not the only possible one, but that it <b>went</b> <b>the</b> deepest.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1915 Dyer {{was through}} with Australia, the New Zealand Truth {{reporting}} that he had left by 4 December, and by Christmas Eve the American press were already announcing his arrival in the States. In January, Dyer was in San Francisco, where he fought local boxer Bob McAllister, losing on points in a four-round contest. He then travelled to the East Coast and to New York, and on 6 May 1916 {{he was back in}} the ring, in a ten-round fight with local boxer Tommy Maloney. The fight <b>went</b> <b>the</b> distance ending in a draw, though local newspapers gave the decision to Maloney. After the fight Dyer entertained the crowd with an operatic song.|$|E
5|$|Dyer {{continued}} to box regularly in New York State losing to Frankie Notter in June and then recording a draw with George Ashe in July. Dyer {{appears to have}} forgone fighting for over a year, but {{then returned to the}} ring in July 1917, both contests held at the Rochester Airdome. He was given his first win since arriving in America in his encounter with Willie Langford but this was followed by another loss, this time to Bryan Downey. On 28 September 1917, Dyer fought in Boston, Massachusetts, facing local fighter Tommy Robson, in which the referee declared a draw. His next fight, against Frankie Maguire in Pennsylvania, was given to Dyer by the Philadelphia Record after the fight <b>went</b> <b>the</b> distance. Dyer's next fight was against Lew Williams, which was given to Williams by the New York Evening Telegram, though The New York Sun believed Dyer shaded the match with more precise punching.|$|E

5|$|Following the explosions, the Allied advance was {{virtually}} unopposed as the Germans were too stunned and demoralised {{to put up}} much resistance. However, not everything <b>went</b> <b>the</b> Australians' way. The 3rd Division, under Major General John Monash, suffered heavy casualties when they were shelled by phosgene gas and shrapnel shells while moving towards the line of departure, nevertheless the division still managed to get into position {{for the start of}} the attack. Strong German counterattacks were launched the next day, once again supported by concentrated artillery fire; however, the advance was able to continue on through the mess of concrete blockhouses the Germans had erected and continued on until all the objectives had been taken. Australian casualties amounted to nearly 6,800 men. On 2 July 1917, Major General Holmes was mortally wounded by a German shellburst while surveying the Messines battlefield with the Premier of New South Wales, William Holman.|$|E
5|$|Having found {{success in}} both {{domestic}} and European cup competitions, Revie took the decision to focus exclusively on the league for the 1968–69 campaign. They <b>went</b> <b>the</b> {{rest of the season}} unbeaten in the league following a 5–1 defeat to Burnley at Turf Moor on 19 October, and secured the title with a 0–0 draw with challengers Liverpool at Anfield; after the game Revie led his team back out onto the pitch to applaud the Liverpool supporters, who in turn applauded the Leeds team. His team set a number of records: most points (67), most wins (27), fewest defeats (2), and most home points (39); a still-unbroken club record is their 34 match unbeaten run that extended into the following season.|$|E

The laws show how much value was put on different parts of Welsh life at the time, for example that wealth was measured in cattle; they also show that the court included hunters, who would be restricted to seasonal hunting sessions.|$|E

5|$|In late 1917 Dyer faced Tommy Robson {{again in}} two {{encounters}} in Massachusetts. The first, fought in Boston, was a disputed result after the bout <b>went</b> <b>the</b> distance, {{though it is}} recorded as a win for Robson. The second match, at Cuddy's Arena in Lawrence, {{was intended to be}} between Robson and Ted Lewis, but when Lewis could not fight, Dyer stepped in. This second bout also ended in a newspaper decision for Robson. Despite fighting for twelve rounds against Robson, Dyer entertained the crowd after the fight by playing his ukulele and singing popular songs. As in Australia, Dyer continued to appear at charity events in aid of the war effort. In January 1918 he appeared as part of a fundraiser for the basketball team The Newark Elks, who had several players fighting in Europe. Headlining the bill was world boxing champion Benny Leonard.|$|E
5|$|In {{only his}} second {{fight for the}} UFC, Jon Jones took on The Ultimate Fighter 1 runner-up Stephan Bonnar at light heavyweight in the third fight on the main card. Jones was able to execute {{multiple}} throws and takedowns {{during the first two}} rounds, at one point suplexing Bonnar. Jones also had the most success striking and was able to knock down his opponent with a spinning elbow-strike. Bonnar rallied with strikes against the tiring Jones in the third round, but the bout <b>went</b> <b>the</b> distance with the judges scoring it 29–28 once and 30–27 twice all in favor of Jones.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} over, Compton deceived Bradman with a googly. Bradman {{expected}} {{the ball to}} turn in, but it <b>went</b> <b>the</b> other way, took the outside edge and ran away past slip for four. Bradman leg-glanced the next one for another boundary, before again failing to read a googly on the third ball. This time the edge went to Crapp, who failed to hold on. The sixth ball of Compton's over beat Bradman and hit him on the pads. At the other end, Morris continued to plunder Hutton's inaccurate leg breaks, and Australia reached lunch at 1/121, with Morris on 63 and Bradman on 35. Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs, and in the half-hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Both players had been given lives. Although Australia had scored at a reasonable rate, they had also been troubled {{by many of the}} deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.|$|E

5|$|Just a {{week after}} {{defeating}} Williams, a rematch was announced between Dyer and Holland. The fight venue was Rushcutters Bay Stadium in Sydney and both fighters turned out for a training exhibition in the build-up to the contest. The contest, held on 5 June 1915, was watched by a crowd of 2,000 spectators. The fight <b>went</b> <b>the</b> full distance and in the closing rounds Holland, realising that his only chance of victory was a knockout, attacked Dyer ferociously, staggering the Welshman in the 19th. Despite the late assault, Dyer stayed on his feet and was announced the winner by the referee.|$|E
5|$|On 14 March 1471, Edward's army {{landed at}} Ravenspurn. Gathering more men as they <b>went,</b> <b>the</b> Yorkists moved inland towards York. Edward's march was unopposed at the {{beginning}} because he was moving through lands {{that belonged to the}} Percys, and the Earl of Northumberland was indebted to the Yorkist king for the return of his northern territory. Furthermore, Edward announced that he was returning only to claim his father's title of Duke of York and not to contest the English crown. The ruse was successful: Montagu, who was monitoring Edward's march, could not convince his men to move against the Yorkist king.|$|E
5|$|Squads {{from the}} larger group broke off and moved up the hill toward coal pit number three. One squad took up a {{position}} at the pit number three coal shed; another, at the pump house. A warning party was sent ahead of the squads into Chinatown. They warned the Chinese they had one hour {{to pack up and}} leave town. After only 30 minutes, the first gunshots were fired by the squad at the pump house, followed by a volley from those at the coal shed. Lor Sun Kit, a Chinese laborer, was shot and fell to the ground. As the group at coal pit number three rejoined them, the crowd pressed on toward Chinatown, some men firing their weapons as they <b>went.</b> <b>The</b> smaller group of white miners at the plank bridge divided itself into squads and surrounded Chinatown. One squad stayed at the plank bridge to cut off any Chinese escape.|$|E
