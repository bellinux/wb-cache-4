The fire broke out on February 8, 1937, caused by a welder working in the attic above the fourth floor. He first attempted to extinguish the fire himself, but failed. The fire brigade was alerted and quickly arrived on the site. The men not only had to fight the fire, but also <b>work</b> <b>under</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>conditions,</b> including heavy ice (the temperature was 10 degrees below zero) and a wax layer of 3,500 kg, which began to melt and burn, and hindered the firefighters considerably. Two firefighters were cut off by the fire. One hung outside a window and fell, later dying of his injuries. The other was rescued at the last minute. Some acetylene cylinders exploded, injuring another firefighter. A stairwell threatened to collapse and officers had to withdraw the men. In the end, all of Stockholm's firefighters engaged in fire extinguishing, and all the firefighters were called to duty. In total, there were 70 people on the site, including managers, the fire chief, firefighters, and teachers from officers' school. Only after seven hours was the fire considered to be under control. The damage cost {{over a million dollars}} and Stockholm's milk supply was threatened.|$|E

They are reunited with Monkey, who was captured trying to steal the magical Baldy's cauldron to boil away the Inland Sea. Assisted by a young kitchen servant named Indigo who is from a nearby forest called the Green Darkness, Shimmer and Thorn escape, taking Indigo with them. They manage to make their way to where the Inland Sea dragons now reside, forging dragon steel and garrisoning frontier outposts. Shimmer is able to convince her fellow dragons to relinquish the last strands of a flower that once grew abundantly by the Inland Sea for Monkey to summon the Lord of the Flowers, a powerful ancient being. They nearly fail in getting him the flower, but his summons is successful. The Lord of the Flowers helps Monkey escape and gives them access to Sambar's vault, where they find Baldy's cauldron, which gets cracked during the ensuing fight. Monkey's powerful weapon, his magical size-changing rod, and Civet are also retrieved. On Indigo's request they are transported to the Green Darkness, but find it devastated by the tyrannical human king known as the Butcher. Indigo decides to go with Shimmer and Thorn, along with a repentant Civet.|$|E

30|$|Rollover {{and lateral}} {{instability}} are two common issues of heavy-duty trucks, which {{can result in}} fatal accidents and massive losses. Differential braking (DB) and active steering (AS) {{are two of the}} most effective methods to improve the vehicle yaw stability and untripped rollover accidents [1]. DB and AS systems have their own disadvantages, and researchers have proposed several integrated controllers to overcome them. However, existing research mainly focuses on two-axle vehicles or multi-axle vehicles with two-axle equivalent models [2]. Heavy-duty trucks usually have more than two axles for increased transportation efficiency [3]. DB or AS individually might not control the lateral instability and rollover accident of multi-axle trucks, because multi-axle trucks usually have higher center of gravity and heavier mass and they <b>work</b> <b>under</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>conditions.</b> In a multi-axle truck, distributing the reasonable braking torques and steering angles to suitable wheels is complex. The integrated controller design in a two-axle vehicle cannot be used directly in a multi-axle vehicle. The integrated control system for a multi-axle truck has not been fully studied. Therefore, a practical and effective integrated control system is needed urgently, especially for multi-axle trucks.|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} {{a framework for}} robust foreground detection that <b>works</b> <b>under</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>conditions</b> such as dynamic background and nominally moving camera. The proposed method includes two main components: coarse scene representation as the union of pixel layers, and foreground detection in video by propagating these layers using a maximum-likelihood assignment. Instead of modelling each pixel in the scene separately, we first cluster together pixels that share similar statistics. These pixels/samples are then {{used to create a}} non-parametric adaptive model of the cluster or layer. The entire scene is coarsely modelled as the union of such non-parametric layer-models. A pixel is then detected as foreground if it does not adhere to these adaptive models of the background. A principled way of computing detection thresholds is used to achieve robust detection performance with a pre-specified number of false alarms. Correlation between pixels in the spatial vicinity is exploited to deal with camera motion without precise registration. The proposed technique adapts to changes in the scene, and allows us to automatically convert persistent foreground objects to background and re-convert them to foreground when they become interesting. This simple framework addresses the important problem of robust foreground and unusual region detection, performed at about 10 frames per second on a standard laptop computer. The presentation of the proposed approach is complemented by results on challenging real data and comparisons with other standard techniques. tracking...|$|R

50|$|The {{increasing}} number of wadmal fragments and garments being pulled from the ruins - and concern that the rising water line would soon submerge the site - prompted the Danish National Museum to launch an urgent formal excavation in 1921 led by Paul Norland. He estimated that the shoreline had advanced another 12 metres since the rediscovery less than a century before, and was nearly touching {{the remains of the}} church's southern wall. Norland stated in his book, Buried Norsemen at Herjolfsnes, that he'd never worked on a project that attracted such keen interest from the local inhabitants. One woman informed him that she had become so accustomed to finding pieces of preserved Norse wool that she had fashioned children's garments from the centuries-old fabric, but the wool unsurprisingly was not strong enough to make the clothing practical. <b>Working</b> <b>under</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>conditions</b> during the short digging season, Norland and his crew were eventually successful in recovering full and partial costumes, hats, hoods and stockings. The recovery of these clothes {{is considered one of the}} most significant European archaeological finds of the 20th century. Prior to the Herjolfsnes diggings, these types of garments had essentially only been seen in medieval paintings. Careful analysis and reconstruction of the garments revealed the skill of the Herjolfsnes inhabitants at spinning and weaving, as well as their desire to follow European fashions such as the cotehardie, the liripipe hood and hats in the Burgunderhuen and Pillbox styles. Later analysis using carbon dating suggests that garments were being manufactured at Herjolfsnes as late as the 1430s.|$|R

Solar powered cup anemometer wind measurements with a data logger system were taken at heights of 0. 25 and 0. 5 h, at distances 0. 5 and 1 h, at four sides of the tree in the prevailing wind direction and perpendicular to it, and additionally at 2, 4 and 6 h windward and leeward. The protection effectiveness of the biomass was calculated as a wind reduction ratio and in terms of objects protection, which was evaluated using the dimensionless protection index (É). The study showed that windward protection provided by Leptadenia and Prosopis at level 0. 25 h and distance 0. 5 h was similar, w ith a wind reduction ratio R 0. 8, while Panicum showed comparably higher R-values. Even at the 0. 5 h level, Panicum showed an R of 0. 65 at 0. 5 h distance. Leew ard, at 0. 25 h level differences were small, R increasing from 0. 6 / 0. 7 to 0. 8 / 1 with distance, Leptadenia protecting best. At higher level (0. 5 h) at distances 0. 5 and 1 h Prosopis gave better protection than the other two at distances 0. 5, 1 and 2 h. The research is an exam ple of simple experimental <b>work</b> <b>under</b> <b>difficult</b> environmental <b>conditions</b> in Africa. It was part of studies in which additional attention was paid to quantification aspects under such conditions as well as to the problems it helped solve in the African societies concerned as agrometeorological service...|$|R

In a world that has grown suddenly chilly and lonely I know I must go on with my <b>work</b> <b>under</b> <b>difficult</b> and novel <b>conditions</b> (and now well into the routines of middle age) {{as if there were}} no such things as loss and disappointment. I am, I learned long ago, an uncreative, unimportant man. And yet, I suppose, I do something; I count; it is better that I should help than not in the great task of literature, the great task of becoming the thought and the expressed intention of the race, the task of taming violence, organizing the aimless, destroying error, the task of waylaying the Wild Asses of the Devil and sending them back to Hell. It does not matter how individually feeble we writers and disseminators are; we have to hunt the Wild Asses. As the feeblest puppy has to bark at cats and burglars. And {{we have to do it}} because we know, in spite of the darkness, the wickedness, the haste and hate, we know in our hearts, though no momentary trumpeting has shown it to us, that judgement is all about us and God stands close at hand.|$|R

More and more academics, most of them women, are doing research in the area. Despite this, Women’s and Gender Studies are often marginalised and lecturers have to fight for the space to teach them. Papers on women tend to be ghettoised at conferences. Thus at its first meeting in 1989 the Gender Research Group (GRG) felt the need to celebrate this growing area of <b>work</b> being produced <b>under</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>conditions</b> by organising a conference. The purpose of the conference was to stimulate further research and provide a forum for the work people were already doing. The organising committee wanted the conference to be a place for debate with an emphasis on research and theory. The Conference was organised around four main themes: * Race, class and gender * Culture and ideology * Organising women and policy * Everyday life. It was the first academic conference in South Africa to focus directly on women’s and gender issues. It was attended by participants from most southern African countries as well as southern Africanists from the USA, Britain, Canada and the Netherlands. There were sixty-four papers, some presented in plenary discussion and others in smaller parallel sessions. In addition, two panel discussions were organised, one on ‘Conceptualising gender’ and the other on ‘Organising women’ The conference was followed by two one-day workshops - ‘Teaching Women’s Studies’ and ‘Gender and Popular Education’...|$|R
