30|$|The {{second type}} of {{deadlock}} is shown {{at the bottom of}} Figure 13. During the time when the application is writing to the control registers, the 3 D graphics SoC may concurrently attempt to read data from the memory of the QEMU. A deadlock occurs as the master <b>write</b> <b>process</b> is unable to lock the bus, but the slave read is unable to complete its data request via the SC receiver. We store the request of the master <b>write</b> <b>process</b> into a cyclic queue to solve this deadlock, because the master <b>write</b> <b>process</b> does not wait for an acknowledgement. This solution results in a race condition between the SC receiver and the master <b>write</b> <b>process</b> as the SC receiver attempts to enqueue while the master <b>write</b> <b>process</b> attempts to dequeue. We solve this problem by making the operations atomic.|$|R

The career of the novelist in the book closely tracks the career of Irving himself, making it Irving's most overtly autobiographical novel.|$|E
5|$|Sorkin {{has written}} for the theatre, film and television, and in each medium his level of {{collaboration}} with other creators has varied. He began in theatre which involved a largely solitary <b>writing</b> <b>process,</b> then moved into film where he collaborated with director Rob Reiner and screenwriter William Goldman, and eventually worked in television where he collaborated very closely with director Thomas Schlamme {{for nearly a decade}} on the shows Sports Night, The West Wing and Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip; he now moves between all three media. He has a habit of chain smoking while he spends countless hours cooped up in his office plotting out his next scripts. He describes his <b>writing</b> <b>process</b> as physical because he will often stand up and speak the dialogue he is developing.|$|E
40|$|Not {{only has}} the use of {{computers}} as writing instruments {{had a profound effect on}} writing practice and attitudes towards writing, it has also created new possibilities for research on writing. In the field of cognitive writing research especially, keystroke logging programs have become very popular. In this paper we describe a logging program called Inputlog. Inputlog 4 consists of four modules: (1) a data collection module that registers digital <b>writing</b> <b>processes</b> on a very detailed level; (2) a data analysis module that offers basic and more advanced analyses (e. g. pause and revision analysis); (3) an integration module that allows data merging between data files from different sources; (4) a play module that enables researchers to review and visualize a writing session including revisions. In this paper we describe the main functional characteristics of Inputlog 4 and further explain its functionality by presenting three case studies from different research projects: (1) <b>writing</b> <b>processes</b> of novice and professional writers, (2) <b>writing</b> <b>processes</b> in L 1 and L 2, and (3) <b>writing</b> <b>processes</b> and learning styles. 1...|$|R

Writing assignments for The Land of Gorch sketches were given to Saturday Night Live staff as a penalty for being the least-liked among the production team. Writers generally regarded the routines as childish.|$|E

Though most songs originated from a guitar or bass riff from Ballou or Newton, all members had equal input on the <b>writing</b> <b>process,</b> with each member proposing different songs. Vocalist Bannon wrote a few songs for Axe to Fall, but were scrapped because they were slower {{than the rest of the}} songs, and did not fit the energy of the album.|$|E
5|$|Cowboy Bepop: The Movie {{was first}} {{announced}} in September 1999: {{the majority of}} the series' staff were carried over along with Watanabe, including producer Masahiko Minami, character designer/animation director Toshihiro Kawamoto, and writer Keiko Nobumoto. The original Japanese cast also returned. The <b>writing</b> <b>process</b> was finished and production began in July 2000. It was produced by the studios Sunrise, Bones and Bandai Visual. While Sunrise worked on the original series, Bones was founded in 1998 after the series' completion by Minami, Kawamoto and Hiroshi Ōsaka. The length of the film's production allowed the team to ensure its high quality.|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{coordination}} {{of the different}} <b>writing</b> <b>processes</b> is central to producing good-quality texts, and is a fundamental component of writing skill. In this article, I propose a general theoretical framework for considering how <b>writing</b> <b>processes</b> are coordinated, in which <b>writing</b> <b>processes</b> are concurrently activated with more or less overlap between processes depending on their working memory demands, and with {{the flow of information}} cascading from central to peripheral levels of processing. To support this view, I review studies that investigated effects of handwriting skills on concurrent activation of higher order processes, and research on word production that explored how information cascades between levels of processing in the writing system. I argue that a parallel and cascading model makes it possible to combine different findings in a common integrated framework and thus constitutes a heuristic for further understanding {{coordination of}} the different levels of processing involved in writing...|$|R

40|$|In {{the study}} {{reported}} here, we explored <b>writing</b> <b>processes</b> employed by 70 undergraduate learners of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) through questionnaires and think-aloud protocols. Then we looked for possible differences in the <b>writing</b> <b>processes</b> employed by high- and low-aptitude learners. We observed that learners with higher aptitude scores devoted more attention to clausal complexity than those {{with lower levels of}} aptitude. Moreover, they resorted less frequently to their mother tongue while writing texts in English. High-aptitude EFL learners also used more global planning strategies than their low-aptitude peers and edited while writing much more frequently. Our review showed that even though aptitude has been extensively researched in second language acquisition and shown to correlate with the level of success in different skills, it has rarely been considered in relation to <b>writing</b> <b>processes.</b> We suggest that, as classroom teachers, EFL writing instructors accumulate and incorporate knowledge of their students’ aptitude in deploying their teaching strategies...|$|R
5|$|Following their {{tour with}} Elliot Minor, the <b>writing</b> <b>process</b> {{for the new}} album began. Although all the music's writing was {{credited}} to the entire band, vocalist Josh Franceschi and guitarist Max Helyer were usually the biggest creative forces among the group, being responsible for the ideas behind the songs. The band's work resulted in the album having a sound that most critics associated with pop punk, though this result was unintended. The album was recorded in two weeks at Outhouse Studios in Reading, Berkshire with producers Matt O'Grady and John Mitchell.|$|E

5|$|It {{took several}} years for Ivy to {{finalize}} the material {{included on the}} album, due {{to the birth of}} lead singer Dominque Durand and musician Andy Chase's daughter, Justine, in 1999.

Following their drop from Epic Records in 1999, the recording suffered further delays after their New York City studio burned down. After being without a record label, they considered signing to Japanese music group EastWest to strengthen their fan base. However, independent record label Nettwerk offered to fund the album; Ivy signed with both labels and began preparing it for a national release.|$|E
