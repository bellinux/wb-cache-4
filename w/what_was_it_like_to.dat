40|$|This entry {{considers}} {{the early modern}} concept of the ‘holy affections’, a set of special spiritual emotions in Christian culture that were directed at God, and thought to be imbued with the Holy Spirit. Developed {{in the writings of}} the medieval theologians St Augustine of Hippo and St Thomas Aquinas, the holy affections included love for the Lord, praise and thankfulness, and the joyous anticipation of salvation. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> experience these emotions? Why, when, and how were they expressed? Drawing on diaries and sermons from seventeenth-century England, I show that the holy affections were often found to be the most exquisite of all human feelings – they saturated the body and soul, filling it with ‘heart melting sweetness’. Exploring these delightful experiences helps rebalance our picture of the emotional landscape of early modern Christian culture, which has traditionally concentrated on the gloomier passions of guilt, grief, and fear...|$|E

Using oral history as well as archival research, it provides an insight into children's wartime lives in which bombing often featured prominently, {{even though it has}} slipped out of French collective memory. How prepared were the French for this aerial onslaught? <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be bombed? And how did people understand why their 'friends' across the Channel were attacking them? Divided into three parts dealing with expectations, experiences and explanations of bombing, this book considers the child's view of wartime violence, analysing resilience, understanding and trauma. It contributes significantly to scholarship on civilian life in Occupied France, and will appeal to students, academics and general readers interested in the history of Vichy France, oral history and the experiences of children in war...|$|E

This volume of Sjuttonhundratal deals with various ways of life during the eighteenth century.

This kind of dramatic success has not been seen in any other field of medicine, except perhaps following the introduction of penicillin many years ago. I wanted to try to answer the question “What was it like?” <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> care for patients with AIDS, a disease that didn’t even exist when I was in college?

40|$|An {{interdisciplinary}} {{exploration of}} the sensory experiences invited and explored by textual and material products of the medieval period. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> experience the medieval world through one’s senses? Can we access those past sensory experiences, and use our senses to engage with the medieval world? How do texts, objects, spaces, manuscripts, and language itself explore, define, exploit, and control the senses of those who engage with them? This collection of essays seeks to explore these challenging questions. To do so is inevitably to take an interdisciplinary and context-focused approach. As a whole, this book develops understanding of how different fields speak to one another when they are focused on human experiences, whether of those who used our sources in the medieval period, or of {{those who seek to}} understand and to teach those sources today. Articles by leading researchers in their respective fields examine topics including: Old English terminology for the senses, effects of the digitisation of manuscripts on scholarship, Anglo-Saxon explorations of non-human senses, scribal sensory engagement with poetry, the control of sound in medieval drama, bird sounds and their implications for Anglo-Saxon sensory perception, how goldwork controls the viewing gaze, legalised sensory impairment, and the exploitation of the senses by poetry, architecture, and cult objects...|$|E
40|$|While {{some work}} has {{recently}} been done on native women in Russian America, very little {{has been written about}} Russian women and even less about the European non-Russian women who went to Russia’s North American colonies in Alaska—the easternmost outpost of the Russian empire in Alaska—from the western periphery of the empire. This paper is about three such women, Elisabeth von Wrangell, Margaretha Etholén and Anna Furuhjelm, and their experiences as governors’ wives in Russian America between 1829 and 1864. As the wives of governors, these women had a semi-official role as representatives of the Russian empire, which meant that they were expected to contribute to its civilizing mission in the colonies. The paper aims to understand the experiences of these women as governors’ wives in the light of prescriptive notions of true womanhood and of {{the role of women in}} the civilizing mission. <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be a young woman in the most remote part of the Russian empire and how can these experiences be related to the cult of domesticity and the new ideal of womanhood that took form in the nineteenth century?

40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the life-writing produced by three authors from {{the first half of}} the XX century in Spain. These autobiographical texts were written by women who were part of the cultural and political scene of pre-civil war Madrid, and who lived in exile, mainly in Latin America countries - Cuba, Mexico, and Argentina. Each of these authors start the reconstruction of the past in three distinct ideological projects: philosophic in the case of María Zambrano (1904 - 1991); leftist political thought in the case of María Teresa León (1903 - 1988); and feminist in the case of Concha Méndez (1998 - 1986). An interdisciplinary theoretical framework forms the basis for my analysis of these texts. This includes the ideas of Sidonie Smith, Sylvia Molloy, and Beatriz Sarlo, and premises of Mikhail Bakhtin, specifically the relationship between the author and the characters in artistic production, and the representation of space and time, as understood under the concept of chronotope. Reading these autobiographies under those theoretical principles allows me to elaborate some ideas about <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be a woman, writer, and intellectual in the same historical and political time period. At the same time, it promotes a discussion about the appropriation strategies and the resistance possibilities against the hegemonic discourses of the era, mainly those related to literary creation as well as gender representation...|$|E
