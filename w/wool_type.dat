Building upon previous data, different <b>wool</b> <b>types</b> were tested via two different methods to assess their absorption ability with regard to these VOCs. For formaldehyde analysis, samples were subjected to cycles of exposure to excess formaldehyde gas whilst the weight gain was measured.

The data presented indicates that wool is able to absorb a range of VOCâ��s in differing amounts.

From 1993 to 2000, lambs of hair (n= 1070) and wool (n= 1044) type Dorper sheep, and corresponding reproductive records from 872 and 874, respectively, were analysed. There was {{no significant differences between}} hair and <b>wool</b> <b>type</b> lambs for body weight from 42 days till 12 months of age, and for pre- or post-weaning growth rate. The analysis of conformation tend to suggest that the hair type lambs were blockier with shorter legs, compared to the leggier appearance of the <b>wool</b> <b>type</b> lambs. This is also evident from the longer carcass length (108. 5 vs. 107. 2 cm) and hind leg length of <b>wool</b> <b>type</b> lambs compared to hair type lambs. With regard to other carcass traits, <b>wool</b> <b>type</b> lambs had heavier carcasses (19. 6 vs. 19. 2 kg) and higher dressing percentage (49. 9 vs. 49. 0 %), though, fat measurements and carcass grades were similar.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} master {{thesis is}} an {{experimental}} investigation of the acoustic characteristics of absorbing materials used in mufflers for trucks and cars. The difference in the composition between different <b>wool</b> <b>type</b> materials consists of difference in material, fibre diameter, length, density and fibre orientation. It is also possible to construct mufflers using micro perforated plates (MPP), either solely or in combination with <b>wool</b> <b>type</b> materials. When a specific material is selected {{the characteristics of the}} performance can be altered by compressing the material to different bulk densities. It was investigated how some of these properties change the airflow resistivity of the material. When the airflow resistivity of the material is known this parameter can be used in FEM software to describe how a specific material will react, behave and perform as an absorbent. Two different methods were used to extract the airflow resistivity. The fastest method is from the ISO standard ISO 9053 were the airflow resistivity is measured over a sample with a flow speed down to 0. 5 mm/s. The second method is the Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) with which the airflow resistivity is extracted from the acoustic transfer matrix of the sample. Both methods are fully described in the report. The TMM was used within a frequency range of 0 ‐ 1600 Hz at no flow conditions. Measurements using both methods were performed at room temperature. Ten different <b>wool</b> <b>type</b> materials and two different kinds of MPP were studied. For the <b>wool</b> <b>type</b> materials, the airflow resistivity was measured with the fibres parallel and perpendicular to the direction of sound and airflow. The material samples had bulk densities of 80 ‐ 210 g/l. For the MPP the specific airflow resistance was measured with the static flow perpendicular to the plates. The results from the two methods were compared and the transmission loss, absorption coefficient, reflection coefficient and the complex speed of sound were calculated using the transfer matrix from the TMM. Regarding the TMM these data were also compared to the results that can be calculated when using the measured airflow resistivity together with the empirical expressions from Delany‐Bazley & Miki. Repacking of some materials were done in order to study the differences introduced by the packing process. IV The conclusions after the measurements were: • The agreement between the two methods was very good. • The value of the resistivity was doubled for measurements with the fibres perpendicular to the direction of sound. • When the materials {{with a high degree of}} micro strands were oriented with the fibres perpendicular to the direction of sound there was a resonant behaviour in the sample. The onset frequency of this resonance increased with increasing bulk density. This resonance leads to difficulties in predicting the behaviour of real life exhaust systems. • In order to get reliable results, further studies on the micro perforated plates must be made, with even lower flow velocities and sound pressure levels and maybe with other methods...|$|E

Greater price differentials {{for changes in}} parameters {{are available in the}} high value products, e. g. worsted woven apparel fabric, so demand affects the price of <b>wool</b> <b>types</b> differently.

Twisting also results in certain effects, such as crepe effect.

The present work took for study three types of chemical fibers (wool-type rayon, wool-type polyester, wool-type polyacrylonitrile) and two types of wool fibers S 11 and S 12. The main characteristics of <b>wool</b> <b>type</b> chemical fibers (fiber count, nominal length, breaking length, relative elongation, brightness) and of wool fibers (diameter, almeter length, uster irregularit) have been measured. Then the fibers were subjected to thermal treatments in certain conditions. From the researches performed for the both wool blends, S 11 and S 21, one can notice that the torsional rigidity/stiffness increases after the thermal treatment and the wool fibers changes their handle accordingly. The rayon fibers present the biggest torsional rigidity, as compared to the other types of analyzed fibers, both untreated and heat treated. After heat treatment, the rayon fibers considerable improves their handle.

In instances where surveyed groups may have a known history of responding to questions differently, rather than using the traditional sharing method to address those differences, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) can be employed.

The independent and dependent variable structures for Multiple Regression, factorial ANOVA and ANCOVA tests are similar. ANCOVA is differentiated from the other two in that it is used when the researcher wants to neutralize the effect of a continuous independent variable in the experiment. The researcher may simply not be interested in the effect of a given independent variable when performing a study. Another situation where ANCOVA should be applied is when an independent variable has a strong correlation with the dependent variable, but does not interact with other independent variables in predicting the dependent variable’s value. ANCOVA is used to neutralize the effect of the more powerful, non-interacting variable. Without this intervention measure, the effects of interacting independent variables can be clouded...|$|E

Eight single jersey knitted fabrics were assessed under a controlled protocol using forearm sleeves made of the test fabric and a control fabric.
