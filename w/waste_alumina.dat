However, waste recycling represents an alternative recovery option, which is interesting from an environmental and economic standpoint. In this work, recycling of kaolin processing waste {{in the manufacture of}} mullite-based ceramics was investigated based on the statistical design of mixture experiments methodology. Ten formulations using kaolin processing <b>waste,</b> <b>alumina</b> and ball clay were used in the experiment design. Test specimens were fired and characterized to determine their water absorption and modulus of rupture. Regression models were calculated, relating the properties with the composition.

The optimization of the sintering behaviour of glass-ceramic compositions containing clay and alumina platelets was carried out. Highly crystalline and dense products (> 90 % theoretical density) were fabricated by sintering at temperatures in the range 1040 to 1060 °C, depending on composition. Addition of waste glass to influence the sintering temperature and sintering interval was also investigated. Composites showed higher fracture strength (up to 97 MPa) and hardness than unreinforced glass-ceramics. The "best" composition in terms of density and mechanical properties contained 20 wt% alumina platelets.

In this work, red mud (RM), a highly alkaline <b>waste</b> from <b>alumina</b> industry, was utilized instead of the traditional alkali. A composite coagulant (RMPACl) was prepared from RM and the semi-product of polyaluminum chloride (ACl). Important factors for preparation, such as RM/ACl ratio, reaction temperature and reaction time, were investigated and optimized to be as follows: RM/ACl ratio of 0. 25 (w v(- 1)), reaction temperature of 80 degrees C and reaction time of 4 h. The results of coagulation tests showed that RMPACl exhibited better performance than PACl for removal of phosphate. The optimum coagulation pH range of RMPACl was found to be 6. 0 - 8. 5. High phosphate removal efficiency (> 94. 9 %) was achieved by dosing RMPACl at the dosage of 147. 5 mg l(- 1).

40|$|Abstract. Enormous use {{of ground}} for various {{purposes}} {{in urban areas}} has led to disappearance of green-planted surfaces. Considering space constraints, planted roofs become one promising and stabilizing choice to improve amenity and reduce the thermal loads on the building’s shell. However, a critical issue for rooftop garden is the release of pollutants in urban runoff. Not only particles but also dissolved pollutants should be removed from building drainage because of their potential impact on water environment. To add functions for the control of pollutant outflow, bauxsite minerals made of red <b>waste</b> from <b>alumina</b> refineries were incorporated in the rooftop garden as a special soil. The minerals have high trapping capacities for trace metals and other soluble species. Moreover, {{they are easy to}} integrate with rooftop garden systems. Based on their equilibrium capacity for removing pollutants, an optimum amount of bauxsite minerals is suggested. The characteristics of rainwater runoff and pollutants release were compared for normal and modified rooftop garden in laboratory scale.

The red mud with HCl treatment shows the highest adsorption capacity among all the red mud samples, giving adsorption capacity of 0. 58 mg P/g at pH 5. 5 and 40 °C.

Attempt is made to use red mud as filler in these fiber reinforced polymer matrix composites. Red mud is the solid <b>waste</b> generated in <b>alumina</b> plants during the production of alumina from bauxite by Bayer’s process. Characterization of the resulting red mud filled glass fiber reinforced polyether-ether-ketone composite is done. Silicon carbide is a known hard ceramic material. SiC powders are also filled in this glass fiber reinforced poly-ether-etherketone matrix and mechanical characterization of the resulting new composite is done. Solid particle erosion wear behaviour of this new class of composites is investigated. Erosion, an important material degradation mechanism encountered in a number of structural and engineering components, has been extensively investigated over the last few decades. However, the influence of factors like impact velocity, impingement angle, erodent size and stand-off distance (SOD) on erosion behavior of glass fiber reinforced polyether-ether-ketone composites is yet to be fully investigated. To this end, a design of experiment (DOE) approach based on Taguchi method is adopted in this work to evaluate effect of these factors on erosion rate of the composite. The study indicates that the rate of erosion of composites by impact of solid erodent is greatly influenced by these control factors. This work draws the conclusions that reinforcement of glass fiber into the poly-etherether-ketone (PEEK) matrix improves the flexural strength quite significantly, thus making it a potential material for structural applications. Addition of red mud and silicon carbide to glass fiber reinforced poly- ether-ether-ketone composites further improves the flexural strength, flexural modulus and tensile strength of the material. Addition of these fillers is leading to reduction of density and subsequently the strength to weight ratio of the composites. Glass fiber reinforced poly-ether-ether- ketone composites filled with red mud and silicon carbide powders exhibit much better resistance to solid particle erosion in comparison to the un-filled composite. The rate of wear of the composite material is also greatly influenced by operational variables like impact angle, velocity of impact, stand-off distance etc. and material variables like erodent size and composition of composites. These composites exhibited maximum erosion rate at an impingement angle of 60 0 under similar experimental conditions. The Taguchi experimental design approach suggests that the erodent size plays the most significant role in erosive wear of these composites. The angle of impact and the impact velocity are other major influencing factors. Stand-off distance has the least effect on the erosion rate. This work leaves a wide scope for future investigators to explore many other aspects of such composites. Wear of polyether-ether-ketone matrix composite has been a much less studied area. Many other problems like effect of fiber orientation, loading pattern, weight fraction of ceramic fillers on erosion response of such composites require further investigation.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2014 Kırmızı çamur, alüminyum üretiminde, boksit cevherinden alümina üretmek içinkullanılan Bayer prosesi sonucunda oluşan bir atıktır. Nüfus ve şehirleşmedeki artışa paralel olarak alüminyum talebi de artmakta olup, alüminyum üreten tesisler için kırmızı çamurun depolanması ve bertaraf edilmesi en önemli sorunlardan biri haline gelmektedir. Arsenik ise, metal ile ametal arasında özelliğe sahip olup, gerek doğal olarak gerekse antropojenik kaynaklardan ötürü yerkabuğunda yaygın halde bulunan bir elementtir. Doğada inorganik ve organik halde bulunan arsenik, toksik ve kanserojen sınıfına girebildiğinden, son yıllarda yer altı ve yer üstü sularında karşılaşılan en önemli sorunlardan biridir. Bu çalışmada, kırmızı çamurun arseniğin uzaklaştırılması üzerindeki etkisi araştırılmıştır. Öncelikle {{adsorbent}} olan kırmızı çamur ile arseniğin uzaklaştırılması için optimum pH değeri, karıştırma süresi vekırmızı çamur miktarı saptanmıştır. pH 2, 5 ile pH 10 arasında farklı değerlerde çalışılmış ve sentetik olarak hazırlanan çözeltilerden en iyi adsorblanmanın pH 5, 5 ta olduğu gözlenmiştir. Kırmızı çamur miktarının incelendiği deneylerde, 0, 5 gr/lt kırmızı çamurun az miktarda olmasına rağmen etkin olduğu anlaşılmıştır. Farklı arsenik konsantrasyonlarında da sürdürülen çalışmalarda, 100 ppm e kadar oldukça yüksek bir verimle elde edilmiştir. 100 ppm üzerindeki yüksek konsantrasyonlarda arsenik etkinliğini arttırmak için kırmızı çamurun ısı ve asit ile aktifleştirilmesi yoluna gidilmiştir. Asit aktivasyonu ile istenilen sonuç elde edilemezken, 600 °C de ısı ile aktivasyon sonucu arsenik gideriminde yüksek konsantrasyonlarda verim artışı sağlanmıştır. Arsenik giderimi için bir diğer adsorban olan piritin, kırmızı çamur ile birlikte kullanımının da etkisi araştırılmış; ancak kırmızı çamurun tek başına daha etkin bir adsorban olduğu görülmüştür. Sentetik arsenik konsantrasyonundan elde edilen veriler bir de gerçek atık suya uygulanmak istenmiş ve Eti Maden Emet Bor tesislerindenalınan doğal pH sı 9 olan 38, 5 ppm arsenik içeren atık su numunesi ile de çalışmalar yapılmıştır. Bunun neticesinde doğal pH da 4 gr/lt kırmızı çamurun dahi yetersiz olduğu, ancak pH 5 değerinde arsenik gideriminde oldukça başarılı sonuçlar elde edilmiştir. Son olarak bu çalışmaya bir atık değerlendirme olarak baktığımızda, kırmızı çamur atığının kullanıma elverişliliğinin de göz önünde bulundurulması gerektiğinden, nakliyesinde kolaylık olması açısından pelet haline getirilmesi düşünülmüş ve elde edilen veriler ışığında iri ve ince boyutta peletler hazırlanıp bir de bunların arsenik adsorbsiyonu üzerindeki etkisi incelenmiştir. Bunun neticesinde ince peletlerle daha iyi sonuçlar elde edilmiş; ancak numune alma süreleri arttıkça arsenik giderme veriminin azaldığı gözlenmiştir. Arsenic exhibits {{properties of}} metal and non metal. Due to both natural and anthropogenic sources, arsenic is the 20 th the most abundant elements in the earth s crust and is a component of morethan 245 minerals. These are mostly ores containing sulfide, along with copper, nickel, lead, cobalt, or other metals. Arsenic exists in nature in the oxidation states +V (arsenate), +III (arsenite), 0 (arsenic) and -III (arsine). Commonly inorganic arsenic appears {{in the aqueous environment}} in the states +V and +III as arsenous acid (As(III)), arsenic acid (As(V)), and their salts. It is usually found in the environment combined with the elements such as oxygen, chlorine, and sulfur. Arsenic combined with these elements is called inorganic arsenic. On the other hand if arsenic combined with carbon and hydrogen is called organic arsenic. Inorganic arsenic compounds can be methylated by bacteria, fungi, and yeasts to the organic compounds such as monomethylarsenic acid (MMA), dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), and arsine. Arsenic compounds are used in wood preservation and insecticides, as an additive to lead and copper for hardening, glass manufacturing, in small quantities in semi-conductor manufacturing. Arsenic is carcinogenic and may cause lung cancer, bladder cancer, liver cancer, renal cancer, and skin cancer. It is also harmful to the nervous system. Other health effects may include vessel damage, high blood pressure, anemia, stomach sickness, and diabetes. The toxicity of arsenic depends on its binding form. Organic arsenic compounds are less toxic than inorganic arsenic compounds. It has been estimated that {{tens of millions of people}} are at risk exposing to excessive levels of arsenic from both contaminated water and arsenic-bearing coal from natural sources. Humans are exposed to this toxic by breathing, eating, or drinking the substance, or by skin contact. The current World Health Organization recommended value for arsenic in drinking water is 0. 010 mg/Land in wastewater is 0, 5 mg/L. Arsenic cannot be destroyed in the environment. It can only change its form, or become attached to or separated from particles. Therefore it is one of the main problems considering underground and ground source waters in recent years, because of its toxicity and carcinogenic. On the other side, aluminium is the second-most used metal after steel, largely because of its use in a wide variety of products. It is estimated that aluminium composes about 8 % of the earth s crust. Aluminium is a light silvery-white metallic element and it is resistant to corrosion. it is very reactive but forms a tough layer of oxide when exposed to air, preventing further corrosion and it is ductile and easily malleable. It is an excellent conductor of heat and electricity. Aluminium is used electrical equipments such as car, ship, aircraft construction; metallurgical and chemical processes; domestic and industrial construction; packaging and kitchen utensils. Aluminium is non-toxic (as the metal) nonmagnetic and non-sparking. It occurs naturally in many foods in very concentrations and is also present in many pharmaceuticals and drinking water. High levels in the body can be toxic. Production of aluminium from ore is dependent upon alumina, which is extracted from bauxite ore which contains 30 - 60 % alumina. The production of alumina consumes more than 90 % of the world s production of bauxite. The main minerals in bauxite are gibbsite (Al 203. 3 H 20), boehmite (Al 203. H 20), and diaspore. Bauxite ore refers to bauxite that contains sufficiently high levels of Al 203 and suitably low levels of Fe 203 and silica to be economically mineable. Red Mud is a <b>waste</b> left after <b>alumina</b> has been extracted from bauxite in Bayer process for refining bauxites into alumina via digestion with sodium hydroxide. This process can be separated into two parts; firstly the extraction of alumina from bauxite, and secondly the smelting of aluminum metal from alumina. Sodium hydroxide is used to dissolve the aluminum oxide. This produces a sodium-aluminium solutionfrom precipitated &# 12310;Al(OH) &# 12311;_ 3. Afterwards it is calcined to produce oxide, from which the metal is recovered. The remaining waste product of bayer process is called red mud due to the colour of the original bauxite ore and the iron oxide it contains. In addition to iron, it contains other particles include silica, unleached residual aluminium, and titanium oxide. For each tonne of alumina produced, the process can leave behind about two tonnes of red mud. However, This ratio is dependent on the type of bauxite used in the refining process. The red mud is a complex chemical soup, a watery slurry of fine rock particles and salts, containing toxic heavy metals. The red mud also has a high pH because of the sodium hydroxide solution used in the refining process. Therefore it is strong enough to kill plant and animal life, and to cause burns and damage to airways if it is breathed. Parallel to the increase in population and urbanization, the demand of aluminum is also increasing and as a consequence, storage and removing red mud becomes more and more important for the facilities produce aluminum. Therefore, cosidering the facts of both arsenic and red mud issues, in this study, the influence of red mud on removing arsenic from waters is investigated. The aim was, by using red mud as a low cost adsorbent, having a good efficiency of arsenic removal from waters and waste waters. Primarily, optimal pH for arsenic removal, stiring duration, and amount of red mud are determined. In the course of this study in a range from pH 2. 5 to pH 10 have been studied in many different values and the best in synthetic absorbable s concentration of arsenic is observed at pH 5. 5. Also it has been concluded that even 0, 5 gr/L red mud is enough effective for arsenic removal at pH 5, 5 with a concentration of 10 ppm arsenic. In other experiment, instead of synthetic arsenic, 38, 5 ppm arsenic contaminated water taken from Eti Mine Emet Boron facilityis used. The experiment performed in the original pH 9 and despite incresing the amount of red mud, good results couldn t be achieved which shows the importance of pH arrangement in the arsenic removal process. This study also investigates different arsenic concentrations, enough high yields is obtained up to 100 ppm. In order to increase the arsenic efficiency the heat, acid, and red mud are activated at concentrations as high as 100 ppm. While desired results could not be obtained by acid activation, with heat activation at 600 °C the yield increase is achieved with high concentrations. Pyrite is another adsorbant to remove arsenic. Although pyrite s removal effect together with red mud has been elaborated as well, it has been found that red mud alone is more effective to remove arsenic. In order to apply the data obtained by sentetic arsenic concentration to the waste water, some experiments has been conducted with natural pH 9 and 38, 5 ppm arsenic concentration obtained by Eti Maden Emet boron facility. As a result, it has been determined that at natural pH value, even 4 gr/L of red mud is not enough, but the yield quite rises at pH 5. It has been also worked with another waste sample from Eti Maden Emet boron facility which has a 81, 66 ppm arsenicconcentration. With this sample, it has been tried to see the effects of the amount of red mud in arsenic removal with a value of pH 5 in wastewater. As a result, with 4 gr/L red mud, it has been able to reduce the arsenic concentration to a level below 0, 5 ppm, which is the limit for permitted levels of arsenic in waste waters. For the application and the transportation with ease, red mud transformed to the red mud pellets by using starch. The adsorption experiments in a colunm system with two different size of these pellets show that with the fine pellets, better results are obtained. While the course sized pellet has a 42 % of arsenic removal efficiency in the samples taken after 30 minutes, the fine sized pellet has about 60 % of arsenic removal efficieny. On the other hand, these efficiencies are reduced with increasing sampling time. When the fine sized pellets are worked with the real arsenic contaminated water taken from Emet boron facility, about 80 % of arsenic removal efficiency is achieved. As a result, red mud which is the biggest waste problem of aluminum production either with the storage necessity or the disposal difficulties, is used for removing arsenic from the waters within the scope of waste utilization.
