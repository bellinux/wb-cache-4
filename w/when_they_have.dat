5|$|House mice {{use both}} audible and {{ultrasonic}} {{calls in a}} variety of contexts. Audible vocalizations can often be heard during agonistic or aggressive encounters, whereas ultrasound is used in sexual communication and also by pups <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> fallen out of the nest.|$|E
5|$|It is also {{possible}} to obtain a prenatal diagnosis for an embryo or fetus in the womb, using fetal genetic material acquired through chorionic villus sampling. An amniocentesis can be performed if the pregnancy is further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby for indicators of the HD mutation. This, too, can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. Prenatal testing can be done when a parent has been diagnosed with HD, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> had genetic testing showing {{the expansion of the}} HTT gene, or <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include termination of pregnancy, and on the difficulties of a child with the identified gene.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} insects are toxic or distasteful <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> fed on certain plants that contain {{chemicals}} of particular classes, but not <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> fed on plants that lack those chemicals. For instance, some {{species of the}} subfamily Danainae feed on various species of the Asclepiadoideae in the family Apocynaceae, which render them poisonous and emetic to most predators. Such insects frequently are aposematically coloured and patterned. When feeding on innocuous plants however, they are harmless and nutritious, but a bird that once has sampled a toxic specimen is unlikely to eat harmless specimens that have the same aposematic coloration. When regarded as mimicry of toxic {{members of the same}} species, this too may be seen as automimicry.|$|E
30|$|As {{had been}} found in Experiment 3, in this experiment, {{participants}} hypercorrected <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> made an error and were given corrective feedback. <b>They</b> also hyper'corrected' <b>when</b> given false information <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been wrong initially. However, they did not hyper'correct' <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been correct and were given false feedback.|$|R
30|$|The hypercorrection {{results from}} the first two {{experiments}} were further clarified and bolstered by Experiment 3. Participants hypercorrected <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> made an error and were given corrective feedback, but did not hyper'correct' <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been correct and were given false feedback. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been right, it seems plausible that <b>they</b> may <b>have</b> had some knowledge that the feedback they were given was wrong (when it was). Interestingly, though, <b>they</b> also hyper'corrected' <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> made an error in Phase 1 and they were given false feedback following their error. Participants {{did not appear to}} be able to recognize misinformation and exclude it from being encoded <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> made an error.|$|R

5|$|Most of the time, goalkeepers do low-intensity work (treading water {{without too}} much effort) but when they do work (for example, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a man down or are in the ready position) it is very intense.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} the double burden is {{exacerbated}} in Asian countries due to the large cultural norm of women doing care work held by both men and women. In many developed countries, women drop out of work <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> children {{in order to have}} more time to take care of them.|$|E
5|$|This line of {{argument}} follows the political philosophy of John Locke in the Two Treatises on Government (1689). Locke wrote that the people {{had the right to}} resist their government when their property rights were violated, and that nations have the same sovereign rights even <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been conquered by another.|$|E
30|$|Participants in Phase 3 {{gave the}} factually correct {{responses}} more frequently <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been correct originally but given false feedback (M[*]=[*]. 85, SD[*]=[*]. 24) than <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been wrong originally {{but had been}} given correct feedback (M[*]=[*]. 66, SD[*]=[*]. 16, t(27)[*]=[*] 6.30, p[*]<[*]. 000).|$|R

60|$|Martin smiled, {{but felt}} that it was good advice notwithstanding, and {{resolved}} to act upon it. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> ascertained from Mrs Lupin that Pecksniff had already returned from the great ceremonial at which <b>they</b> <b>had</b> beheld him in his glory; and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> fully arranged the order of their proceedings; they went to bed, intent upon the morrow.|$|R
5|$|In Series 3, Adam and Rachel seek intracytoplasmic sperm {{injection}} (ICSI) <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> trouble conceiving a child naturally. The characters {{take out}} bank loans of thousands of pounds {{to pay for the}} treatment, which is unsuccessful each time. The producers devised this storyline because IVF was a major contemporary issue and wrote the treatment as a failure because it was representative of the odds of conception in real life.|$|E
5|$|Male elk {{retain their}} antlers {{for more than}} half the year and are less likely to group with other males <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> antlers. Antlers provide a means of defense, as does a strong front-leg kick, which is {{performed}} by either sex if provoked. Once the antlers have been shed, bulls tend to form bachelor groups which allow them to work cooperatively at fending off predators. Herds tend to employ one or more scouts while the remaining members eat and rest.|$|E
5|$|Mature adult ants of {{this species}} mostly eat sweet substances, so dead insects are given to their larvae {{collected}} while foraging. However, larvae are only fed insects <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> reached a particular size. Workers will mostly collect small insects, sap-sucking insects along with the honeydew which is taken to their nest to feed their young. Observations have been made of fly predation by jack jumper ants; they would only attack the smaller fly species and ignore larger flies.|$|E

5|$|Other mammals can be destructive. Possums {{tend not}} to eat {{the leaves of the}} tree, but are very fond of eating the sugar-rich {{flowering}} stalks as they emerge. They also like using the tree as a sleeping place. Rabbits can be more destructive, especially during periods of drought, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been seen to eat through the base until a tree falls, and then eating the fallen tree completely. Horses can also fell a tree by eating through the trunk.|$|E
5|$|The octopus (along with cuttlefish) has {{the highest}} brain-to-body mass ratios of all invertebrates, and is also greater than many vertebrates. It has a highly complex nervous system, only part of which is {{localised}} in its brain, which is contained in a cartilaginous capsule. Two-thirds of an octopus's neurons {{are found in the}} nerve cords of its arms, which show a variety of complex reflex actions that persist even <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> no input from the brain. Unlike vertebrates, the complex motor skills of octopuses are not organised in their brain via an internal somatotopic map of its body, instead using a nonsomatotopic system unique to large-brained invertebrates.|$|E
5|$|The {{seasonal}} polyphenism in {{willow grouse}} differs between Scottish and Scandinavian populations. In Scotland, grouse have two plumages (breeding and non-breeding), while in Scandinavia {{there is a}} third plumage, a white winter morph. The genetic basis for this is not in the melanin pigment system, and is probably due to regulatory changes. The behaviour of moulting females in springtime depends on their plumage state: they tend to sit on snow while they are mainly white, but choose the border between bare ground and snow <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> more dark feathers. They seem to be choosing the best compromise between camouflage and food quality.|$|E

5|$|There are varying {{interpretations of}} the {{original}} intent of Congress and of the ratifying states, based on statements made during the congressional debate over the amendment, {{as well as the}} customs and understandings prevalent at that time. Some of the major issues that have arisen about this clause are {{the extent to which it}} included Native Americans, its coverage of non-citizens legally present in the United States <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a child, whether the clause allows revocation of citizenship, and whether the clause applies to illegal immigrants.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} solo flights glider pilots are {{required}} to stay within gliding range of their home airfield. In addition to solo flying, further flights are made with an instructor until the student is capable of taking a glider cross-country and of handling more difficult weather. Cross-country flights are allowed <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> sufficient experience to find sources of lift away from their home airfield, to navigate, and to select and land in a field if necessary. In most countries pilots must take a written examination on the regulations, navigation, use of the radio, weather, principles of flight and human factors. Proposals are being made to standardise the training requirements across European countries.|$|E
5|$|Characters {{have several}} {{different}} stats and gauges: their health (HP), a magic meter stocked by Technical Points (TP), and Learning Points (LP) for learning skills. a character's respective agility or luck, {{and how a}} character reacts to attacks. Attack types are physical and magical, while defense is limited to physical attacks. Characters gain experience levels through accumulating experience points (EXP). EXP and Gald is earned through battles, along with recovering a degree of TP and occasionally items dropped by defeated enemies. Skills, attributes that change different stats, can be assigned to each character. The number of skills that can be assigned is calculated {{by the number of}} skill points each character has available. Battling with equipment associated with a particular skill enables that character to learn it <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> filled their LP meter. Cooking, creating meals with ingredients found in battle or around explored environments, can also be used by individual characters to restore their HP and TP and grant temporary enhancements. Recipes are learned from a character called the Wonder Chef.|$|E

5|$|Dalton {{applied the}} logic of abolitionism {{to the cause of}} women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race, women should not have to be subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as part of that slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body. Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E
5|$|Danube crested newts {{have the}} longest aquatic {{phase in the}} genus Triturus. Adults move to their {{breeding}} sites in February or March and usually stay there for six months; occasionally, they may even stay longer or return to the water in autumn. Males court females with a display of ritualised body movements. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> gained the female's interest, they guide it over a spermatophore they deposit on the ground, which the female then takes up with her cloaca. The eggs are fertilised internally. As in other crested newts, a female lays around 200 eggs per season, which are folded individually into leaves of aquatic plants. Larvae develop over two to four months until they reach metamorphosis and leave the water.|$|E
5|$|Foraging {{for food}} is {{generally}} conducted {{on a daily}} basis, from dawn to dusk <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> chicks to feed. Overnight trips are sometimes made, especially as the chicks grow older; a 2008 study that used surgically implanted data loggers to track {{the movement of the}} birds showed the foraging trips become longer once the chick-rearing period is over. Birds venture out for 10–20 days during incubation and before the moult. Macaroni penguins are known to be the largest single consumer of marine resources among all of the seabirds, with an estimated take of 9.2 million tonnes of krill a year. Outside the breeding season, macaroni penguins tend to dive deeper, longer, and more efficiently during their winter migration than during the summer breeding season. Year round, foraging dives usually occur during daylight hours, but winter dives are more constrained by daylight due to the shorter days.|$|E
