Even if he defeated Urquiza, his forces would probably be weakened enough to prevent him from challenging the Brazilian army that was ready to invade Argentina. With no other alternative, Rosas remarked: [...] "There is no other way; <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> for the high stakes and go for everything. Here we are, and from here there is no retreat." [...] After an unsuccessful battle against Urquiza on 3 February 1852, Rosas fled to Buenos Aires.

2500|$|Throughout his career, Cruyff became {{synonymous with}} the playing style of [...] "Total Football". It is a system where a player who moves out of his {{position}} is replaced by another from his team, thus allowing the team to retain their intended organizational structure. In this fluid system, no footballer is fixed in their intended outfield role. The style was honed by Ajax coach Rinus Michels, with Cruyff serving as the on-field [...] "conductor". Space {{and the creation of}} it were central to the concept of Total Football. Ajax defender Barry Hulshoff, who played with Cruyff, explained how the team that won the European Cup in 1971, 1972 and 1973 worked it to their advantage: [...] "We discussed space the whole time. Cruyff always talked about where people should run, where they should stand, where they should not be moving. It was all about making space and coming into space. It is a kind of architecture on the field. We always talked about speed of ball, space and time. Where is the most space? Where is the player who has the most time?

Although Coulson felt Anderson's departure was premature, she praised the storyline's [...] "huge shock value". Coulson felt heartbroken when she was filming Billie's death scenes, of this she stated during an interview with Inside Soap: [...] "When <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the scene where Carol sees Billie lying dead in the living room, it was really sad - not just because a mum had lost her son in tragic circumstances, but also because I felt almost as though I was losing Devon too." ...|$|R

2500|$|From {{the start}} of the series, the lack of a {{relationship}} with her father serves as motivation for Erica's actions. She {{is an example of the}} Nixon staple of the [...] "lost daddy's girl." [...] Eric abandons her and her mother before {{the start of}} the show, when Erica is nine years old. As a result, she develops a severe abandonment complex. Since Eric leaves his family for a successful career in Hollywood, Erica also longs for a life of fame and a successful man. This motivation is maintained in the character decades into the series. [...] "Susan added a lot of Erica's background," [...] Behr said. [...] "Rather than playing it as if Erica's just a rotten character, she added the pathos of this child who was deserted by her father. Every time she did a scene about how 'My father loves me. I know that he loves me and nobody is going to tell me differently,' she colored it with the knowledge that she had really been deserted. It worked so well that the writers reached the point where they said <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> this out." [...] In 1989, the Eric Kane character makes his first appearance as Erica goes in search of him and finds him working as a clown at a circus. She attempts to help him out of his current circumstances, but he ends up betraying her and leaving Pine Valley.|$|E

Three months later, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> it again at a plenary session of all the composers who sat on the Radio Committee, and it wasn't until the following year {{that we were able to}} perform it in public, in the Small Hall of the Moscow Conservatory on March 1, 1950.|$|R

He got his first start after junior quarterback Demetrius Brown broke the thumb on his throwing hand in the Indiana game. [...] Prior to Brown's thumb injury, Taylor had completed only 9 of 21 pass attempts for 133 yards, 2 interceptions and 1 touchdown. At the time, Michigan head coach Bo Schembechler expressed confidence in Taylor, telling the press: [...] "Michael Taylor is a fine quarterback. He's smart. He's a good quarterback.

Immediately before the tour, drummer Chip Damiani quit the band, to be replaced by future Mountain drummer N.D. Smart.

Under his tenure, he decided to move the USTA out of the West Side Tennis Club and convinced New York City officials to turn the Singer Bowl into the USTA National Tennis Center (renamed the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in 2006). Moreover, he decided to let a tournament between the United States and South Africa take place in Newport Beach, California in April 1977 in spite of backlash from African nations and protesters due to the apartheid regime.

[...] "That period seemed really arduous for me because I was so physically challenged by singing", recalls Schwarzenbach, [...] "Every day was full of dread, <b>having</b> <b>to</b> stand up there and see what would happen.
