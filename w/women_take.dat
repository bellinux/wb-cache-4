5|$|In rural areas, women {{traditionally}} work alongside {{their family}} to produce crops like tea and rice. In urban areas, women work in factories, living away from home. Most of these factory workers are young girls who send their income to their families. To help maintain {{the rights of}} women in factories, labor unions and organizations were built. In their homes, <b>women</b> <b>take</b> care of their children and cook.|$|E
5|$|Indian {{women wear}} bikinis when they {{vacation}} abroad or in Goa without the family. Despite the conservative ideas prevalent in India, bikinis {{have become more}} popular. In summer, when <b>women</b> <b>take</b> up swimming, often in a public space, a lot of tankinis, shorts and single-piece swimsuits are sold.

5|$|Those {{who have}} {{bacteria}} in the urine but no symptoms should not generally be treated with antibiotics. This includes those who are old, those with spinal cord injuries, {{and those who have}} urinary catheters. Pregnancy is an exception and it is recommended that <b>women</b> <b>take</b> 7days of antibiotics. If not treated it causes up to 30% of mothers to develop pyelonephritis and increases risk of low birth weight and preterm birth. Some also support treatment of those with diabetes mellitus and treatment before urinary tract procedures which will likely cause bleeding.|$|E

25|$|Some {{transgender}} women {{report a}} significant reduction in libido, depending on the dosage of antiandrogens. A small number of post-operative transgender <b>women</b> <b>take</b> low doses of testosterone to boost their libido.

Raising the dosage of estrogen or adding a progestogen raises the libido of some transgender women.|$|E

25|$|In {{more recent}} years, {{scholars}} have noted {{a shift in}} the demographics of migrant workers. Particularly in Asian countries, but also in Latin American countries, a growing number of women are traveling abroad for jobs as domestic and service workers. In many of these cases, <b>women</b> <b>take</b> on jobs caring for the children of families in wealthier nations, while leaving their own children in the country of origin. This can mean that their own children are not well-cared for and may suffer as a result.|$|E

25|$|The {{issue of}} women's right {{to study at}} {{universities}} was raised during the very last session of the estate parliament in 1865 in a motion from Carl Johan Svensén, {{a member of the}} farmers' estate. The reception was mixed, with the most negative views coming from the clergy. In the following years the issue continued to be debated at the universities. In 1870, it was decided to let <b>women</b> <b>take</b> the secondary school examination ("studentexamen") that gave the right to entry at universities and the right to study and complete degrees at the faculties of Medicine in Uppsala and Lund and at the Caroline Institute of Medicine and Surgery in Stockholm. A common view was that the female sensitivity and compassion would make women capable of working as physicians, but their right to work was still restricted to private practice. Women's rights to higher education was extended in 1873, when all degrees except those in the faculties of theology and the licentiate degree in Law were made accessible for women.|$|E
25|$|Ireland {{became a}} member of the United Nations in 1955. Since 1958, the Defence Forces has had a {{continuous}} presence on peacekeeping missions, mainly in the Middle East. The Congo was the first large scale involvement that Irish troops had abroad since the foundation of the Irish State. The Belgian Congo became an independent Republic on 30 June 1960. Twelve days later, the Congolese government requested military assistance from the United Nations to maintain its territorial integrity. The Irish government consented to a request from the Secretary General for a contingent of Irish troops to serve with the UN Force in the Congo, and so on 28 July 1960 the Defence Forces involvement in Africa began with the UN mission ONUC (UN Operation in Congo). Six thousand one hundred and ninety one Irish soldiers took part in the mission and twenty six were killed. The largest casualties were sustained on 8 November 1960 at Niemba when nine Irish UN peacekeepers were massacred. Irish involvement with the mission ended on 30 June 1964. Each year on the nearest Saturday to the anniversary of the Niemba Ambush ONET commemorates the event with a mass and wreath laying ceremony in Cathal Brugha Barracks, Rathmines, Dublin. The general public is invited to attend the event which normally commences with a parade from the main square in Cathal Brugha Barracks at 11.45 to St. Patrick's Church, also in Cathal Brugha Barracks, on the Saturday morning. Normally over 100 ex-servicemen and <b>women</b> <b>take</b> part in the event and dignitaries from the Defence Forces, Department of Defence and politicians from Ireland and abroad also take part in the ceremony.|$|E
