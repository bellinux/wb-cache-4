5|$|The {{veracity}} of Hahn's claim was questioned {{as early as}} 1876, and the illustration appears to be plagiarised from the plate by François-Nicolas Martinet which was published at least 50 years earlier. After King Maximilian died in 1825, his collection was auctioned off, but no Mascarene parrot was mentioned in the inventory list of species. Hahn {{did not mention the}} date in which he actually saw the bird which could have been long before 1834. However, the fact that Martinet's image was copied and that no mounted specimen exists (though such a rare bird <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> preserved) makes Hahn's account dubious. He may instead have based his account on other sources or even hearsay.|$|E
5|$|A lull {{probably}} occurred {{early in}} the afternoon, and a break for rest and food <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> needed. William may have also needed time to implement a new strategy, {{which may have been}} inspired by the English pursuit and subsequent rout by the Normans. If the Normans could send their cavalry against the shield wall and then draw the English into more pursuits, breaks in the English line might form. William of Poitiers says the tactic was used twice. Although arguments have been made that the chroniclers' accounts of this tactic were meant to excuse the flight of the Norman troops from battle, this is unlikely as the earlier flight was not glossed over. It was a tactic used by other Norman armies during the period. Some historians have argued that the story of the use of feigned flight as a deliberate tactic was invented after the battle; most historians agree that it was used by the Normans at Hastings.|$|E
5|$|The churchyard covers {{some two}} acres. Most of the headstones in the churchyard are modern – {{many of them}} are from the nineteenth century – but the churchyard, which is now closed to new interments, {{contains}} some old monuments. The whole churchyard and church is surrounded by what was once a typical sign of an early Celtic church; an oval formation of trees. There are also indications which suggest the remains of an early pond, probably for keeping fish for the priests and monks who once lived there. There is no visible trace of any conventual buildings (which <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> mostly relatively slight wooden structures, and never extensive). In the early nineteenth century Meyrick does however record the survival of what appeared to be stone monastic or church buildings.|$|E

5|$|The fort at Castleshaw, {{constructed}} from turf and timber, was built around 79 and guarded the York to Chester Roman road. Due to the site's protected {{status as a}} Scheduled Ancient Monument {{it has not been}} possible to excavate the fort, however previous trenches have demonstrated that the fort had two phases to its construction. The location of the fort's granary, stables, the principia (headquarters), the praetorium (commander's tent), and six long narrow buildings which are possibly workshops or storerooms are all known. The fort was small, <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> home to around 500 soldiers of an auxiliary cohort, and fell out of use during the mid AD90s. Rather than allow the defences to fall into potentially hostile hands or be used against Rome, the fort was slighted.|$|E
5|$|On 24 June, Monmouth's army encamped at Pensford, {{and a small}} force skirmished {{with the}} Gloucester Militia {{to take control of}} Keynsham, a vital {{crossing}} point over the River Avon. Monmouth intended to attack the city of Bristol (the largest and most important city after London at that time). However, he heard the city had been occupied by Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort. There were inconclusive skirmishes with a force of Life Guards commanded by Feversham. These attacks gave the impression that there was a much larger royalist force in the vicinity then there actually was. Several historians have speculated that if Monmouth had marched as quickly as possible for Bristol at this point, when it was only protected by the Gloucestershire militia, he <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> able to take the city and the final outcome of the rebellion might have been very different. Once Bristol had been taken, more recruits would have been attracted to the Rebellion and a later march on London would have been possible.|$|E
5|$|Julian's comitatus, {{although}} only half its normal size, was of high quality, containing {{some of the}} best regiments in the Late Roman army, with an awesome combat reputation. All were palatini (top-grade regiments). A substantial proportion of his troops were of barbarian, mostly Germanic, birth. An analysis of known names of officers and men in the auxilia palatina infantry regiments suggests that anywhere between 33% and 50% of the effectives were barbarian-born (the Roman-born troops were mostly Gallo-Romans). Of the German-born recruits, many <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> Alamanni. There is little evidence that this affected their loyalty. On the contrary, the history of Julian's Gallic campaign shows that his barbarian troops were fiercely loyal and reliable. It is true that there were a few isolated cases of Germanic deserters who defected to the enemy, but these were mostly motivated by personal reasons, not by ethnic solidarity. The only recorded instance of the latter was an officer who allegedly alerted members of his own tribe that Julian was planning a campaign against them. In the vast majority of cases, it is clear that regimental loyalties prevailed over ethnic ones. This is evidenced by the fierce alacrity of Julian's troops to engage with the enemy and the determination with which they fought the battle (3 of the 4 tribuni killed at Strasbourg had barbarian names). Regarding training, the Roman troops were career professionals, constantly drilled in formation manoeuvres and combat techniques. Their most important advantage in a pitched battle was formation drill: the ability to hold one's position in a unit at regular intervals, and to replace fallen comrades, so that a unit maintains its shape and coherence as it moves or engages.|$|E

30|$|In {{this case}} the initial {{physician}} was deceived {{by the fact that}} the patient did not have the typical symptoms and signs of a perforated ventricular ulcer, but instead presented with acute chest pain. As a part of the secondary evaluation of the patient, a FATE was performed. The intention was to diagnose or exclude obvious cardiac and pulmonary/pleural pathology. Instead, as an incidental finding, it gave the diagnosis of pneumoperitoneum. Had the patient not been examined with FATE, the correct diagnosis and treatment <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> delayed for several hours since the patient had not yet developed the classical signs of a perforated ventricular ulcer.|$|R

25|$|But these taxes <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{outweighed by}} the loss of the annual poll tax {{previously}} paid by peregrini, from which as Roman citizens they would now be exempt. It seems unlikely that the imperial government could have foregone this revenue: it is therefore almost certain that the Antonine decree was accompanied by a further decree ending Roman citizens' exemption from direct taxes. In any case, citizens were certainly paying the poll tax in the time of Emperor Diocletian (r. 282-305).|$|E

There is little {{evidence of}} the naval activities of the English kingdoms before the mid-9th century, but King Edwin of Northumbria (616/7-633/4) conquered the Isle of Man and Anglesey, and another King of Northumbria, Ecgfrith, sent a military expedition to Ireland in 684.|$|E
50|$|In 1983 Astra withdrew its neuropharmacological drug Zelmid, {{which had}} only {{introduced}} the year before, {{because of concerns}} over side effects. Zelmid was a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and although Astra was {{a pioneer in the}} SSRI area, they did not follow up with another drug using the same mechanism. Instead, it was the US pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Company which later introduced the bestselling SSRI drug Prozac, which lead Astra to realise that they <b>would</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> able to beat Lilly to this lucrative market if they had continued their SSRI drug development. Despite losing out in the SSRI area, in the 1990s, Astra had become one of the heaviest companies on the Stockholm stock exchange, to a large extent due to profits from Losec.|$|R
