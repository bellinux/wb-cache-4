5|$|By 1957 {{the synagogue}} sanctuary, {{which had been}} {{designed}} for 350 families, had become too small to accommodate Temple Israel's over 1,100 member families. In addition, since the 1950s Memphis's Jewish community had been steadily moving from the downtown, where Temple Israel's Poplar Avenue building was located, to the eastern suburbs; by 1957 {{over half of the}} members, and three-quarters of those <b>with</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> the congregational school, lived there. School attendance increased rapidly, and the student body soon outgrew its 1951 building. The school had to split attendance in 1959, with the younger children attending on Saturday and the older ones on Sunday, and by 1961, 780 children were enrolled. In the early 1960s, Temple Israel began holding weekday classes at Beth Sholom, which was closer to most members.|$|E

Mike Moehnke of RPGamer cited the games as not being perfect, but was superior to the Super Famicom game Legend of the Super Saiyan. Kat Bailey of 1UP.com felt the game was made <b>with</b> <b>children</b> <b>in</b> mind, stating that the vibrant colors and the fast-paced gameplay would keep kids interested in the game.|$|E

40|$|The {{interest}} {{of studies on}} the wooden sculpture {{of the eighteenth century}} in Sardinia has focused primarily on the work of Giuseppe Antonio Lonis, which was reported in the past most of the devotional wooden statues of the eighteenth century. Today, with advances in research, not only is it possible to distinguish the works of Lonis those from Campany, but also identify among them those due to specific operators and workshops.
