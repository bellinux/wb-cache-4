But he was crying uncontrollably, noiselessly, with his face twisted like a mask, contorted and the tears running down the amazing grooves in his cheeks. Blindly, his face always this horrible <b>working</b> <b>mask,</b> he groped for his hat, for his way down from the terrace. It was eight o'clock, but still brightly light. The other people were staring. In great agitation, part of which was exasperation, she stayed behind, paid the waiter with a half-sovereign, took her yellow silk coat, then followed Skrebensky.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the first}} European institutes for microelectronics, the Arbeitsstelle für Molekularelektronik Dresden AME, was founded in 1961 by WERNER HARTMANN. The purpose was to develop {{processes}} for fabrication of integrated circuits. Concerning microlithography at first a five-stage mask technique was used since 1965. The artwork original which was called "Vorlage" was cut with a scale of about 200 : 1. Using a reduction camera the artwork original was reduced about 20 times, to get the reticle known as the "Zwischennegativ". This reticle was then further reduced about 10 times by "step and repeat", using a projection microscope, to get a master mask known as the "Originalschablone" whose scale was then 1 : 1. By direct photocopying of the master mask one obtained a <b>working</b> <b>mask</b> which was called the "Arbeitsschablone". Finally, an aligned direct exposure of the <b>working</b> <b>mask</b> on to a wafer created, layer by layer, the micro-pattern of the chip array. Concerning the materials a double layer film {{was used for the}} artwork originals, and 2 inch photographic plates were used for the reticles and masks. In this way the first East German bipolar integrated circuits, NOR gates with 8 transistors, were made in Dresden in 1967. This was done with 4 masking levels on 25 mm Si wafers with 1. 5 mm chip size and 20 µm minimal figure width (critical dimensions). In the late 1960 's some improvements were introduced, particularly the 6 -barrel semi-automatic photorepeater, which improved the figure width and gave lower tolerances. The largest chip made in 1969 was a J-K master-slave flipflop, this contained 36 transistors on a chip 1. 6 mm x 1. 8 mm and was done with 9 masking levels and with 10 µm minimal figure width...|$|E

This paper proposes with the application Of morphing involves <b>working</b> <b>mask</b> worn by the implementation platform which typically consists routing can be programmed aliens in Stargate. This provided a very good illusion. We have to pre-and-post processing the image for better extraction of required image from the acquired image. FPGA can implement these observed results.

25|$|The Machines were a {{professional}} wrestling stable that {{performed in the}} World Wrestling Federation in 1986 and 1987. The team consisted of well-known WWF wrestlers <b>working</b> under <b>masks</b> which strongly resembled that worn by Super Strong Machine (Japanese wrestler Junji Hirata) in New Japan Pro Wrestling at the time; leader André the Giant had faced Hirata and two other Strong Machines during tours of NJPW in 1984, getting {{the idea for the}} masks. The gimmick was very much tongue-in-cheek, as the identities of the masked men were obvious to the fans but frustrating to heels when they were unable to prove them. The Machines was the last tag team Capt. Lou Albano managed in the WWF until he returned in 1994 to manage The Headshrinkers.|$|R

40|$|The {{configuration}} {{space of}} a software system forms a combinatorial space, whose large size generally makes exhaustive testing infeasible. Combinatorial interaction testing (CIT) approaches systematically sample the configuration space and test only the selected configurations. The basic justification for CIT approaches, such as covering arrays, {{is that they can}} cost-effectively exercise all system behaviors caused by the settings of t or fewer options. We conjecture however that in practice many such behaviors are not actually tested in the presence of what we call masking effects failures perturbing behavior in ways that prevent some intended behaviors from being tested. In this work we present a feedback driven adaptive combinatorial testing approach aimed at detecting and <b>working</b> around <b>masking</b> effects. At each iteration of this approach, we detect potential masking effects, heuristically isolate their likely causes, and then generate new covering arrays that allow previously masked combinations to be tested in the subsequent iteration. We, furthermore, empirically assess the effectiveness of the proposed approach by using a large widely used open source software system as our subject application...|$|R
