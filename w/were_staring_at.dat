25|$|Opting to bat first, India {{got off to}} a poor start losing Virender Sehwag in {{the third}} over, after he scored three fours off Farveez Maharoof and Dilhara Lokuhettige. The other opener Mahendra Singh Dhoni soon {{followed}} him to the pavilion, and Rahul Dravid and Yuvraj Singh were to rebuild, from the score at 22/2. They played cautiously, yet the former gave away his wicket, pulling to substitute fielder Upul Tharanga at mid-on. More wickets followed in the form of debutante, Suresh Raina, who was trapped leg before wicket in his first ball in senior international cricket, by Muttiah Muralitharan's doosra, as India crumbled to 64/5. Dravid, however, played a reliable knock, and together with another debutante, Yalaka Venugopal Rao, added 58 in thirteen overs. However, it came to an end too early to help India significantly in the late overs, with leg-spinner Upul Chandana sneaking a ball past his bat and pads and having him bowled for 54, and India <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> a very low score – 123/6 after 33 overs. Harbhajan Singh and Zaheer Khan added 20 each, however, which coupled with Irfan Pathan's slow but steady 21, lifted India to a somewhat competitive score of 205/9 at the end of 50 overs.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Lucky Day" [...] was {{directed}} by Stephen Agnes; it was filmed in New York City, on the East Village. During {{the production of the}} music video, they were not allowed to play music on the streets and so Roberts had to wear an ear piece with the track playing, of which she stated people <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> as she was jumping around on the set with no music playing so people did not understand what she was doing. Roberts expressed her discomfort with the shoot due to the weather saying; ...|$|E
500|$|On tour {{following}} {{the release of}} Dog Beats, Insane Clown Posse was scheduled to perform at Ferris State University in Big Rapids, Michigan, but were delayed by a blizzard. After they arrived, the group was announced by their manager, Alex Abbiss. Bruce remembers that [...] "e came out with no microphones or nothing; we were just right up in the people's faces. Shaggy and I were just fuckin' yelling over our own cassette. The people <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> us in amazement and bewilderment. They {{must have been in}} shock and awe. We finished our two-song set, and the crowd...didn't cheer or boo. They just stood there, stunned"; they later learned that the concert was supposed to occur earlier in the evening, and that they were performing in the wrong building.|$|E

2500|$|Sheldrake's The Sense of Being Stared At was {{published}} in 2003. The book explores telepathy, precognition, and the [...] "psychic staring effect". It reported on an experiment Sheldrake conducted where blindfolded subjects guessed whether persons <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> them or at another target. Sheldrake reported subjects exhibiting a weak sense of being stared at, but no sense of not being stared at, and attributed the results to morphic resonance. Sheldrake reported a hit rate of 53.1%, describing two subjects as [...] "nearly always right, scoring way above chance levels".|$|E
2500|$|... "My father... {{took us to}} see one of {{the first}} talking pictures, The Singing Fool, in which Al Jolson sang [...] "Sonny Boy". In a way, you could say that Jolson was my {{earliest}} influence as a singer. I was so excited by what I saw that I spent hours listening to Jolson and Eddie Cantor on the radio. In fact, I staged my first public performance shortly after seeing that movie... to imitate Jolson... I leaped {{into the living room and}} announced to the adults, who <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> me in amazement, 'Me Sonny Boy!' The whole family roared with laughter." ...|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} the party had {{approached}} within easy talking distance of {{the men at the}} cabin, who <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> them in dumb amazement. Pat chuckled.|$|E

60|$|He assented readily, {{indeed it}} was clear that he wished to be rid of them, for the other men <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> the guide and their companion, and muttering amongst themselves.|$|E

6000|$|All <b>were</b> <b>staring</b> <b>at</b> him thunderstruck and still, except Father Brown, who {{heaved a}} huge sigh as {{of relief and}} fingered the little phial in his pocket.
