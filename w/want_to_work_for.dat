500|$|In June 2008 Combs' {{representative}} denied {{rumors of}} another name change. Combs ventured into reality television in August 2008 with {{the premiere of}} his VH1 series I <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Work</b> <b>for</b> Diddy. After the season finale of Making The Band 4, Combs {{said he would be}} heading back into the studio to record his next album. In an interview with The Daily Mail, he said, [...] "I had Christina Aguilera on my last album, but it's all about Leona Lewis on my next." [...] He appeared—credited under his real name—in two episodes of Season 7 of : [...] "Presumed Guilty" [...] and [...] "Sink or Swim", in the role of lawyer Derek Powell.|$|E
500|$|Following {{exposure}} with British {{magazines and}} newspapers and a successful performance on BBC Radio 1, Bloc Party received a contract offer from Parlophone. The band members declined the opportunity {{because they did not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> a major record label and instead signed a recording contract with East London indie label Wichita Recordings, chosen because it did not want to stamp its agenda on the conception of records. Frontman and chief writer Okereke wanted Silent Alarm to emphasise the importance of finding pleasure in small mundane things, because [...] "those are the sort of things that can be incredibly touching". The album was born out of [...] "a nagging youthful urgency" [...] and the realisation that responsibility has to be taken {{for the first time as}} a young adult. Before recording started, Okereke attended singing lessons to open up his voice.|$|E
500|$|Circulation dropped {{for both}} Amazing and Fantastic; in 1964 Fantastic had a paid {{circulation}} of only 27,000. [...] In 1965 Sol Cohen, who {{at that time}} was Galaxys publisher, set up his own publishing company, Ultimate Publishing, and bought both Amazing and Fantastic from Ziff-Davis. [...] Cohen had decided to make the magazines as profitable as possible by filling them only with reprints. This was possible because Ziff-Davis had acquired second serial rights for all stories they had published, and since Cohen had bought the backfile of stories he was able to reprint them using these rights. [...] Using reprints in this way saved Cohen about $8,000 a year between the two magazines. [...] Lalli decided that she did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> Cohen, and stayed with Ziff-Davis. [...] Her last issue was June 1965. [...] Cohen replaced Lalli with Joseph Wrzos, who used the name [...] "Joseph Ross" [...] on the magazines. [...] Cohen had met Wrzos at the Galaxy offices not long before; Wrzos was teaching English full-time, but had worked for Gnome Press as an assistant editor in 1953–1954.|$|E

500|$|Spider {{decided to}} [...] "dodge his responsibilities" [...] and began {{staying away from}} Toyah, who was {{not happy about it}} as she wanted them to make a commitment. Spider {{eventually}} changed his mind and Hancock commented [...] "The fact is that he really fancies Toyah, and he figures that he may as well be hung for a sheep as a goat." [...] The actor reckoned that Spider and Toyah brought out the best in each other. Spider and Toyah soon began a proper relationship and briefly lived together. However, when Spider announced that he wanted to settle down and buy a house with Toyah, the couple realised that they had started to drift apart. Spider thought that if they got a mortgage together it would help save the relationship, but Toyah did not want that at all. When Spider was offered a promotion, he realised that he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the DSS anymore and quit. He then told Toyah that he had bought them tickets to India so that they could go and [...] "find themselves." [...] However, Toyah insisted that {{she did not want to}} leave Weatherfield. Nicole Carmichael from Inside Soap wrote that while Spider did not want to lose Toyah, he felt that he could not stay and soon departed.|$|E
500|$|During pre-season, {{ahead of}} the 2006–07 campaign, May injured his {{shoulder}} in training, resulting in him missing the club's pre-season tour of Iceland. Millwall manager Nigel Spackman revealed that May's injury would rule {{him out of the}} first two months of the season — [...] "He fell over during the close season, and it looks like {{he is going to be}} out for a couple of months". He made his first appearance of the season in October 2006, coming on as a second-half substitute in Millwall's 2–0 home win against Bournemouth in the Football League Trophy, scoring Millwall's second goal with his first touch of the game. In his first start of the season, he scored after six minutes in the club's 2–1 FA Cup win against Havant & Waterlooville in a game played at Fratton Park, netting from close range after good work from Chris Hackett. Five days later, he provided the assist for Darren Byfield's goal in a 2–2 home draw with Doncaster Rovers. May scored his third goal in five appearances when he scored in Millwall's 3–1 loss at Nottingham Forest on 24 November 2006. After Millwall's 2–0 home win against Bradford City, a game in which May assisted Filipe Morais in scoring Millwall's first goal, Millwall manager Willie Donachie stated — [...] "There's more to come from this team, especially Darren Byfield and Ben May, who are as good as anyone in this league. They're committed, honest players who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> each other". Three days later, on 12 December 2006, May's pacey cross resulted in Nathan Doyle putting the ball into his own net, giving Millwall a 1–0 win against Bradford City after extra-time in the FA Cup. May scored the only goal of the game in a 1–0 victory at Yeovil Town on 3 February 2007, converting Darren Byfield's cross to give Millwall the three points. However, he was substituted after 53 minutes in the same game with an ankle injury, and in March 2007, he was ruled out of first-team action for the rest of the 2006–07 season. Despite this, he made a second-half substitute appearance on the last day of the season in a 2–2 draw at Bradford City, assisting Darren Byfield's goal just after coming on. May scored four times in 19 appearances in a season disrupted by injuries.|$|E
2500|$|After Populous, Bullfrog {{moved into}} the Surrey Research Park, and had around 20 employees. Bullfrog were {{starting}} to gain a reputation, so people started to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> the company. Molyneux also searched for staff himself: he employed an artist that he liked, and when Bullfrog needed programmers, he travelled to universities, including Cambridge University, where he offered computer scientists and banks the chance {{to come to the}} gaming industry.|$|E

2500|$|As Sir Richard Branson {{had decided}} to reduce his media holding, he began talks to sell the station to Capital Radio in a deal {{that would have given}} him 10% of holding company Capital Group. As this became public knowledge, Evans, who did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> Capital, {{publicly}} dismissed them as [...] "a bleating, blowing asthmatic dog." [...] On 9 December, with the assistance of investors, Evans' vehicle Ginger Media Group bought Virgin Radio from Branson for £85m, to control the interests both of Ginger Productions and Virgin Radio. Both Apax Partners and Branson each owned 20% of Ginger Media Group, while Evans and his investors owned the remaining 60%. The group later engaged in the prospect of buying the Daily Star newspaper, but decided against from commercial angles.|$|E

60|$|Work!--a job! More {{even than}} she rebelled against the Withams did she rebel against a job. Albert Witham was distasteful to her--or rather, {{he was not}} exactly distasteful, he was chiefly incongruous. She could never get over {{the feeling that he}} was mouthing and smiling at her through the glass wall of an aquarium, he being on the watery side. Whether she would ever be able to take to his strange and dishuman element, who knows? Anyway it would be some sort of an adventure: better than a job. She rebelled with all her {{backbone}} against the word job. Even the substitutes, employment or work, were detestable, unbearable. Emphatically, she did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> a wage. It was too humiliating. Could anything be more infra dig than the performing of a set of special actions day in day out, for a life-time, in order to receive some shillings every seventh day. Shameful! A condition of shame. The most vulgar, sordid and humiliating of all forms of slavery: so mechanical. Far better be a slave outright, in contact with all the whims and impulses of a human being, than serve some mechanical routine of modern work.|$|E

Now about jazzing up the campaign for prospects: they've already used contesting teams, and given prizes to the kids that bring in the most members. And they made a mistake there: the prizes were a lot of folderols and doodads like poetry books and illustrated Testaments, instead of something a real live kid would <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for,</b> like real cash or a speedometer for his motor cycle. Course I suppose it's all fine and dandy to illustrate the lessons with these decorated book-marks and blackboard drawings and so on, but when it comes down to real he-hustling, getting out and drumming up customers--or members, I mean, why, you got to make it worth a fellow's while.|$|E

6000|$|Everybody in {{this room}} has been taught to pray daily, 'Thy kingdom come.' Now, if we hear a man swear in the streets, we think it very wrong, and say he 'takes God's name in vain.' But there's a twenty times worse way of taking His name in vain, than that. It is to ask God for what we don't want. He doesn't like that sort of prayer. If you don't want a thing, don't ask for it: such asking is the worst mockery of your King you can mock Him with; the {{soldiers}} striking Him {{on the head with}} the reed was nothing to that. If you do not wish for His kingdom, don't pray for it. But if you do, you must do more than pray for it; you must work for it. And, to work for it, you must know what it is: we have all prayed for it many a day without thinking. Observe, it is a kingdom that is to come to us; we are not to go to it. Also, it is not to be a kingdom of the dead, but of the living. Also, it is not to come all at once, but quietly; nobody knows how. 'The kingdom of God cometh not with observation.' Also, it is not to come outside of us, but in the hearts of us: 'the kingdom of God is within you.' And, being within us, it is not a thing to be seen, but to be felt; and though it brings all substance of good with it, it does not consist in that: 'the kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost:' joy, that is to say, in the holy, healthful, and helpful Spirit. Now, if we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>for</b> this kingdom, and to bring it, and enter into it, there's just one condition to be first accepted. You must enter it as children, or not at all; 'Whosoever will not receive it as a little child shall not enter therein.' And again, 'Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.' ...|$|E
