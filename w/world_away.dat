During this time, Galland found work as a forestry worker. There he convalesced and came {{to terms with his}} career and alleged knowledge of Nazi war crimes. Galland began to hunt for the family and traded the kills in the local markets to supplement meagre meat rations. Soon Galland rediscovered his love of flying. Kurt Tank, the designer of the Fw 190, requested that he go to his home in Minden to discuss a proposal. Tank had been asked to work for the British and Soviets, and had narrowly avoided being forcibly kidnapped by the latter. Tank, through a contact in Denmark, informed Galland about the possibility of the Argentine Government employing him as a test pilot for Tank’s new generation of fighters. Galland accepted and flew to Argentina. He settled with Gisela in El Palomar, Buenos Aires. Galland enjoyed the slow life. His time there, aside from work commitments, was taken up with Gisela and the active Buenos Aires night life. Galland found South America a <b>world</b> <b>away</b> from post-war shortages of Germany. Soon, he took up gliding again.|$|E

25|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of the Australian motoring community regarded the device as pseudoscience, and Brock's promotion of it drove away HDT drivers like John Harvey, Allan Moffat and Larry Perkins. Brock also recommended tyre pressures of 22psi (150kPa) for his polariser-equipped vehicles, a level which many regarded as near-dangerously low. Holden, fearing the consequences of being associated with the device and a resulting breakdown in communications over Brock's plans for new models, cut ties with Brock and set up an alternative racing/modification operation, Holden Special Vehicles. During this period, Brock also became involved in the importation and even the modification of the Lada Samara, a cheap Soviet-built hatchback a <b>world</b> <b>away</b> from the high-performance V8-powered Commodores he was famous for. The Lada deal came at the right time for the Brock organisation as it saved the struggling outfit from potential bankruptcy.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} the {{changing}} perspectives on the Virgin Mary based on specific spiritual views, and its adoption within a culture a <b>world</b> <b>away</b> is {{the transformation of the}} image of Mary from a Heavenly Queen to a mother of humility, and the construction of views to accommodate both perspectives. While depictions of the Virgin Mary as the Queen of Heaven or Coronation of the Virgin by artists such as Paolo Veneziano or Giuliano da Rimini were common {{in the early part of}} the 14th century, they did not fit with the virtue of humility which was a key tenet of the spirituality of Saint Francis of Assisi. The concept of the Virgin of humility was developed in the 14th century in order to accommodate Franciscan piety, by depicting the Madonna sitting on the ground, rather than a throne. It offered a view of the Virgin Mary (often barefoot) as a mother nursing a child, rather than a Queen in a coronation scene.|$|E
25|$|Africa was intimately tied to {{the economy}} of the Caribbean. Responsible for fueling the sailors that pirates preyed on, the sugar {{plantations}} of the Caribbean, and the mainland colonies of Spain and Britain, traffic from Africa was routinely targeted by pirates. On numerous occasions, mutinous slave ship crews turned pirate. Bartholomew Roberts wreaked havoc for traders of all goods on the west coast of Africa. One of the earliest rumored places where pirates collected was on the island of Madagascar, off the East coast of Africa. This was their base of operations for their pecking of the Mogul Empire. Here they could prey on the successes of the East India Companies while being a <b>world</b> <b>away</b> from any authority. These are the same outlaws that were plundering the West Indies. The English pirate Avery, or Henry Every plundered a Mogul ship, gaining immense wealth. Avery was said to have settled on Madagascar and was never heard from again, though it was rumored he retired in Ireland. Some writers speculate that this event put in motion a series of events that would help lead to the multitude of laws passed for decades to come.|$|E

500|$|Images of {{homosexual}} male societies remained strongly negative {{in the eyes}} of most SF authors.

In Anthony Burgess's The Wanting Seed [...] (1962) homosexuality is required for official employment; Burgess treats this as one aspect of an unnatural state of affairs which includes violent warfare and the failing of the natural world.|$|E
500|$|In its {{original}} American broadcast, [...] "Moaning Lisa" [...] finished 34th {{place in the}} weekly ratings for the week of February 5–11, 1990 with a Nielsen rating of 13.8. It was the highest rated show on the Fox Network that week. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said: [...] "Certain scenes of this, the most syrupy of Simpsons episodes, sent viewers raised on the later seasons scurrying to the bathroom. Yes, the final moments may give you goosepimples, and are a <b>world</b> <b>away</b> from the anti-schmaltz normally associated with the series, {{but there is still}} much to recommend here.

Its residents possess enormous wealth {{at the expense of}} the poor majority who live so close to them. They live so close, yet a <b>world</b> <b>away,</b> hidden in plain sight.

[...] Prior to the march, the organizers did not outline what specific actions would be taken, nor did they indicate whether or not the group would carry weapons, but encouraged participants to use [...] "creativity" [...] and a [...] "diversity of tactics". [...] According to The Hoya, it was suggested that 30th and M Streets NW would be a preliminary destination.|$|E

"Hello Sunshine" [...] {{received}} generally positive reviews with musicOMH {{calling it}} [...] "one {{of the best}} tracks from … Phantom Power", and Rolling Stone describing it as a [...] "gorgeous opening track". The 'summery' nature of the track was commented on by several journalists with The Observer calling [...] "Hello Sunshine" [...] a [...] "gloriously hazy opener" [...] and Music Critic describing it as [...] "passionately mellow summer doo-wop". However BBC Wales, although describing the track as [...] "an excellent song and a near perfect album opener", called the decision to release [...] "Hello Sunshine" [...] as a single [...] "rather mystifying" [...] stating that it is [...] "a <b>world</b> <b>away</b> from the SFA we've grown to love over the years". The song was featured on the soundtrack of the 2006 film Snow Cake and also appeared in [...] "The Heartbreak", an episode of The O.C.

500|$|DVD Talk's John Sinnott {{rated the}} first series {{four and a}} half out of five stars, writing that it [...] "keeps a lot of the charm and {{excitement}} of the original (as well as the premise), while making the series easily accessible for new viewers". Sinnott praised the faster pace and the design changes that made it feel [...] "fresh", as well as Eccleston's Doctor. However, he felt that Piper only did a [...] "credible" [...] job as Eccleston eclipsed her, and said that the writing was [...] "uneven" [...] with many of the episodes [...] "just slightly flawed". Looking back on the series in 2011, Stephen Kelly of The Guardian wrote, [...] "Eccleston's Doctor may have had many faults– looking like an EastEnders extra and bellowing [...] "FANTASTIC!" [...] at every opportunity being two of them– but he was merely a reflection of a show that, at the time, still didn't know what it wanted to be. The first series of the revived Doctor Who– which featured farting aliens– was a <b>world</b> <b>away</b> from the intelligent, populist science-fiction we know it as now. But then, it is thanks to Eccleston that it got this far at all– a big, respectable name who laid the foundations for Tennant to swag away with the show." ...|$|E
500|$|Erin Martin of PopMatters {{said that}} [...] "When Love Takes Over" [...] had euphoric properties. Martin said {{the song was}} [...] "a classic, triumphant dance number, and Rowland's {{powerhouse}} vocals ensure that this song has anthemic potential for years to come. This song just feels good to listen to". She {{also noted that the}} song was central to the concept and [...] "love-spreading message [...] Guetta delivers on the album as a whole." [...] David Balls of Digital Spy agreed with the song's anthem credentials. [...] " [...] is further evidence that Rowland may no longer be resigned to living in Beyoncé [...] shadow. Fusing classic dance beats with a heady, emotionally charged vocal, it's a <b>world</b> <b>away</b> from the mid-tempo R numbers with which she started her solo career. In fact, this packs a punch from the very first listen, meaning it could well become one of the summer anthems of 2009." [...] However, Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times was less impressed than the other critics, simply noting the song as [...] "a cheesy synthpop makeover of Coldplay's 'Clocks'." [...] Wood did however state that it was among Guetta's best work and was an example of when the DJ is [...] "most commercial".|$|E

500|$|In {{a similar}} {{system to the}} Chinese, the first lunar mansion in Hindu {{astronomy}} was called [...] "Aswini", after the traditional names for Beta and Gamma Arietis, the Aswins. Because the Hindu new year began with the vernal equinox, the Rig Veda contains over 50 new-year's related hymns to the twins, making them {{some of the most}} prominent characters in the work. Aries itself was known as [...] "Aja" [...] and [...] "Mesha". In Hebrew astronomy Aries was named [...] "Teli"; it signified either Simeon or Gad, and generally symbolizes the [...] "Lamb of the World". The neighboring Syrians named the constellation [...] "Amru", and the bordering Turks named it [...] "Kuzi". Half a <b>world</b> <b>away,</b> in the Marshall Islands, several stars from Aries were incorporated into a constellation depicting a porpoise, along with stars from Cassiopeia, Andromeda, and Triangulum. Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Arietis formed the head of the porpoise, while stars from Andromeda formed the body and the bright stars of Cassiopeia formed the tail. Other Polynesian peoples recognized Aries as a constellation. The Marquesas islanders called it Na-pai-ka; the Māori constellation Pipiri may correspond to modern Aries as well. In indigenous Peruvian astronomy, a constellation with most of the same stars as Aries existed. It was called the [...] "Market Moon" [...] and the [...] "Kneeling Terrace", as a reminder for when to hold the annual harvest festival, Ayri Huay.|$|E
500|$|Batman {{has access}} to several gadgets which he can use to explore or fight. The batarang is a {{throwing}} weapon that can temporarily stun enemies or trigger remote devices.

Explosive gel can be used on weak walls and floors, and can be remotely detonatedsending rubble crashing onto an enemy. The line launcher can be used to traverse horizontal spans. The Batclawa grappling devicecan be used to interact with remote objects such as vent covers or to grab enemies. The Cryptographic Sequencer is used to override security panels, open new paths, or disable various asylum functions. Some areas are inaccessible until Batman acquires the gadgets necessary to overcoming the obstacle. The player is encouraged to explore the game <b>world</b> <b>away</b> from the main game to find and solve riddles left by the Riddlerwho hacks into Batman's communication system to challenge him with riddles.

[...] Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy said that AJ's influence on Masood is [...] "infectious". AJ's arrival allows people to see what Masood was like before he married Zainab, as all that was known about him to that point was his life with her. Ganatra stated: [...] "So by opening this door, you get to see what Masood was like in his childhood and as a teenager. Masood did have a naughty streak—he was in a band with his brother, and they got up to mischief. Masood [...] has been put on the straight and narrow [...] But prior to that, he was a teenager like any other—getting into trouble, and that was in cahoots with his brother AJ!" [...] Ganatra said that, as British Asians, Masood and AJ grew up going to clubs and getting into trouble with girls. Now, Masood sees AJ as somebody with [...] "no responsibilities, no children and no stress of having to provide for a family" [...] and as AJ suffers marrital problems, is feeling lonely and has no children, Ganatra said [...] "they want each other's lives, which is quite a nice dynamic to play." [...] He added that [...] "AJ would love the stability of a family life like Masood's, while Masood would love to pack his bags, get drunk and perhaps end up in a stranger's bed. I'm interested to see him bring out Masood's naughty streak—and where that could take them..." [...] AJ is accepting of Syed's homosexuality and his relationship with Christian Clarke (John Partridge).|$|E
