5|$|Eventually, in 1926, King Ferdinand allowed Filitti {{to resume}} his {{political}} career, making him {{a member of the}} Romanian Legislative Council. An emanation of the 1923 Constitution, it comprised experts tasked with reviewing laws endorsed by Parliament, and whose exact role sparked a series of controversies. Filitti was among those <b>who</b> <b>described</b> the Council as a necessary branch of the legislature, rather than as an organ of the executive.|$|E

5|$|Ficus aurea, {{commonly}} known as the Florida strangler fig (or simply strangler fig), golden fig, or higuerón, is a tree in the family Moraceae that is native to the U.S. state of Florida, the northern and western Caribbean, southern Mexico and Central America south to Panama. The specific epithet aurea was applied by English botanist Thomas Nuttall <b>who</b> <b>described</b> the species in 1846.|$|E
5|$|Further {{research}} has revealed {{the presence of}} a second species, G. latidens, from slightly older rocks in Montana than the classic gryposaur localities of Alberta. Based on two parts of a skeleton collected in 1916 for the American Museum of Natural History, G. latidens is also known from bonebed material. Horner, <b>who</b> <b>described</b> the specimens, considered it to be a less derived species.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, another rodent {{from the}} same group was described: Noronhomys, a {{recently}} extinct species from the Brazilian island of Fernando de Noronha. Michael Carleton and Storrs Olson, <b>who</b> <b>described</b> the animal, argued that Holochilus primigenus was probably outside the clade of Noronhomys and extant Holochilus and that H.primigenus should probably be excluded from the genus. When Ulyses Pardiñas described another extinct rodent from this group, Carletonomys from the Pleistocene of Argentina, he suggested that H. primigenus should be placed in its own genus because of its mosaic of Holochilus- and Lundomys-like features.|$|E

5|$|In {{those with}} severe weakness, prompt {{treatment}} with intravenous immunoglobulins or plasmapheresis, together with supportive care, {{will lead to}} good recovery in the majority. Recovery may take weeks to years. About a third have some permanent weakness. Globally death occurs in about 7.5% of those affected. Guillain–Barré syndrome is rare, at one or two cases per 100,000 people every year. Both sexes and {{all parts of the}} world have similar rates of disease. The syndrome is named after the French neurologists Georges Guillain and Jean Alexandre Barré, <b>who</b> <b>described</b> it with André Strohl in 1916.|$|E
5|$|Of {{particular}} {{interest is the}} fact that the Schechter Letter account of Oleg's death (namely, that he fled to and raided FRS, tentatively identified with Persia, and was slain there) bears remarkable parallels to the account of Arab historians such as Ibn Miskawayh, <b>who</b> <b>described</b> a similar Rus' attack on the Muslim state of Arran in the year 944/5.|$|E
5|$|The Latin {{specific}} name pennanti {{is named for}} Thomas Pennant, <b>who</b> <b>described</b> the fisher in 1771. Buffon had first described the creature in 1765, calling it a pekan. Pennant examined the same specimen but called it a fisher, unaware of Buffon's earlier description. Other 18th-century scientists gave it similar names, such as Schreber, who named it Mustela canadensis, and Boddaert, who named it Mustela melanorhyncha. The fisher was eventually placed in the genus Martes by Smith in 1843.|$|E

5|$|The {{disease is}} named after Eduard Heinrich Henoch (1820–1910), a German {{pediatrician}} (nephew of Moritz Heinrich Romberg) and his teacher Johann Lukas Schönlein (1793–1864), <b>who</b> <b>described</b> it in the 1860s. Schönlein associated the purpura and arthritis, and Henoch the purpura and gastrointestinal involvement. The English physician William Heberden (1710–1801) and the dermatologist Robert Willan (1757–1812) had already described the disease in 1802 and 1808, respectively, but the name Heberden–Willan disease has fallen into disuse. William Osler {{was the first to}} recognise the underlying allergic mechanism of HSP.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} {{king of the}} third kingdom is Ibbit-Lim, <b>who</b> <b>described</b> himself as the Mekim of Ebla. A basalt votive statue bearing Ibbit-Lim's {{inscription}} was discovered in 1968; this helped to identify the site of Tell-Mardikh with the ancient kingdom Ebla. The name of the king is Amorite {{in the view of}} Pettinato; it is therefore probable the inhabitants of third kingdom Ebla were predominantly Amorites, as were most of the inhabitants of Syria at that time.|$|E

5|$|An {{unabridged}} {{edition of}} Anne Frank's work {{was published in}} 1995. This version included Anne's description of her exploration of her own genitalia and her puzzlement regarding sex and childbirth, a passage {{that had previously been}} edited out by Otto Frank. When Gail Horalek of Northville, Michigan, learned in March 2013 that her daughter's seventh-grade class was using this edition of the diary in class, she {{filed a complaint with the}} school district asking that an edited version be used instead. Horalek, <b>who</b> <b>described</b> the passage as pornographic, said the school should have obtained prior approval from parents before assigning the book. In 2010, school officials in Culpeper County, Virginia, stopped assigning the unabridged version after similar complaints were lodged.|$|E
5|$|Argentodites is a {{possible}} multituberculate mammal from the Cretaceous of Argentina. The single species, Argentodites coloniensis, is known from a single blade-like fourth lower premolar (p4) from the La Colonia Formation, which is mostly or entirely Maastrichtian (latest Cretaceous) in age. The p4 is 4.15mm long and bears eight cusps on its upper margin and long associated ridges on both sides. The enamel consists of prisms that are completely or partly surrounded by a sheath and that are on average 6.57m apart. Zofia Kielan-Jaworowska, <b>who</b> <b>described</b> and named the fossil in 2007, regarded it as a multituberculate, perhaps a cimolodontan—and thus, {{a member of a}} mostly Laurasian (northern) group and an immigrant to Argentina from North America—on the basis of the shape of the tooth and features of its enamel. In 2009, however, two teams argued that Argentodites may in fact be close to or identical with Ferugliotherium, a member of the small Gondwanan (southern) group Gondwanatheria; although their relationships are disputed, gondwanatheres may themselves be multituberculates.|$|E
5|$|Despite its feathers, most palaeontologists do not {{consider}} Sinosauropteryx to be birds. Phylogenetically, the genus is only distantly related to the clade Aves, usually defined as Archaeopteryx lithographica plus modern birds. The scientists <b>who</b> <b>described</b> Sinosauropteryx, however, used a character-based, or apomorphic, definition of the Class Aves, in which any animal with feathers {{is considered to be}} a bird. They argued that the filamentous plumes of Sinosauropteryx represent true feathers with a rachis and barbs, and thus that Sinosauropteryx should be considered a true bird. They classified the genus as belonging to a new biological order, Sinosauropterygiformes, family Sinosauropterygidae, within the subclass Sauriurae. These proposals have not been accepted, and Sinosauropteryx is generally classified in the family Compsognathidae, a group of small-bodied long-tailed coelurosaurian theropods known from the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous of Asia, Europe, and South America.|$|E
