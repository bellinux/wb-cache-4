40|$|The {{intention}} of this thesis is {{to defend the}} unity <b>word</b> <b>and</b> the Lord's Supper in a reformed worship. Understanding of reformed worship as only nonsacramental service interrupts its inner relationship between word an sacrament. This is the same being in error to proclaim no connection between God's <b>word</b> <b>and</b> His deeds. Whenever God speaks, He supports His words by action. The unity of the <b>word</b> <b>and</b> table expresses the unity of God's <b>word</b> <b>and</b> deeds. This thesis shows that we find two approaches to the worship in Swiss reformation: sacramental where <b>word</b> <b>and</b> sacrament are focus of congregation (Calvin's legacy), and nonsacramental where only the word is its centre (Zwingli's legacy). Both of them have got its advantages and disadvantages and are belonging to the reformed tradition. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R

Subvocalization appears to {{facilitate}} the translating of visual linguistic information into acoustic information [...] and vice versa. For example, subvocalization occurs when one sees a <b>word</b> <b>and</b> is asked to say it (see-say condition), or when one hears a <b>word</b> <b>and</b> is asked to write it (hear-write condition), but not when one is asked to see a <b>word</b> <b>and</b> then write it (see-write condition) or hear <b>and</b> <b>word</b> <b>and</b> then say it (hear-say condition). The see-say condition converts visual information into acoustic information. The hear-write condition converts acoustic information into visual information. The see-write and hear-say conditions, however, remain in the same sensory domain and do not require translation into a different type of code.|$|R
