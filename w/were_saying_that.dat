25|$|Historians {{until the}} late 20th century {{emphasised}} class conflicts from a largely Marxist perspective as the fundamental driving cause of the Revolution. The central theme of this argument was that the Revolution emerged from the rising bourgeoisie, {{with support from the}} sans-culottes, who fought to destroy the aristocracy. However, Western scholars largely abandoned Marxist interpretations in the 1990s. By the year 2000 many historians <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> the field of the French Revolution was in intellectual disarray. The old model or paradigm focusing on class conflict has been discredited, and no new explanatory model had gained widespread support. Nevertheless, as Spang has shown, there persists a very widespread agreement to the effect that the French Revolution was the watershed between the premodern and modern eras of Western history.|$|E
500|$|Emanuel {{is known}} for his [...] "take-no-prisoners style" [...] that has earned him the {{nickname}} [...] "Rahmbo." [...] Emanuel sent a dead fish in a box to a pollster who was late delivering polling results. On the night after the 1992 election, angry at Democrats and Republicans who [...] "betrayed" [...] them in the 1992 election, Emanuel stood up at a celebratory dinner with colleagues from the campaign and began plunging a steak knife into the table and began rattling off names while shouting [...] "Dead! Dead! Dead!". Before Tony Blair gave a pro-Clinton speech during the impeachment crisis, Emanuel reportedly screamed at Blair [...] "Don't fuck this up!" [...] while Clinton was present. Blair and Clinton both burst into laughter. However, by 2007 friends of Emanuel <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> he has [...] "mellowed out". Stories of his personal style have entered the popular culture, inspiring articles and websites that chronicle these and other quotes and incidents. The character Josh Lyman in The West Wing was said to be based on Emanuel, though executive producer Lawrence O'Donnell denied this.|$|E

The phrase [...] "Sock it to me" [...] became a household expression. In an interview with WHYY's Fresh Air in 1999, Aretha said, [...] "Some of the girls <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> to the fellas, like 'sock it to me' in this way or 'sock it to me' in that way.

Wiseman stated: [...] "They <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> it was not for the Canadian market, that it was too audacious". With the title A Guy & A Girl, it ended up airing on Women's Television Network (WTN), (now known as the W Network), a cable television specialty channel, and lasted for two seasons.

2500|$|The police then reacted {{by opening}} {{fire on the}} protesters with live ammunition. They killed 16 people, 14 of whom were students, {{as well as a}} {{journalist}} and Red Cross volunteer, Omar Barrow, and a three-year-old child. Hundreds were reported to have been injured. Immediately following the shooting, people were barred by the police from entering the local hospital to identify the dead. A statement released by the President's office following the shooting stated that 28 people had been admitted to Royal Victoria Teaching Hospital. A student nurse drafted in to help during the massacre later described how there was [...] "immediate chaos in the hospital" [...] and how during emergency operations on gunshot wounds, radio stations <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> only rubber bullets had been used.|$|E
2500|$|Interviewed by The Huffington Post in December 2015, Corbyn {{refused to}} say what his {{religious}} beliefs <b>were,</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> they were a [...] "private thing", while denying {{that he was an}} atheist. He has said that he is 'sceptical' of having a god in his life. He described his concerns about the environment as a sort of [...] "spiritualism". Corbyn has described himself as frugal, telling Simon Hattenstone of The Guardian, [...] "I don't spend a lot of money, I lead a very normal life, I ride a bicycle and I don't have a car". He has been vegetarian since the age of 20, following a stint working on a pig farm in Jamaica. Although he has been described in the media as teetotal, {{he said in an interview}} with the Mirror newspaper that he does drink but [...] "very, very little".|$|E

He uses his power from the ruler of demons to force demons out of people'." [...] In his response to this accusation, Jesus says that speaking out against the Holy Spirit is an unforgivable sin: [...] "Jesus said this because the people <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> he had an evil spirit in him."

2500|$|On June 25, 2014, the Knicks traded guard Raymond Felton {{along with}} former NBA {{defensive}} player of the year Tyson Chandler to the Dallas Mavericks. In return the Knicks received Shane Larkin, José Calderón, Samuel Dalembert, and Wayne Ellington along with two picks for the following day's draft. The trade was the first one that he executed as a front office executive. Many comments <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> [...] "Dolan took over the Mavericks" [...] due to the Knicks' tendency to trade away picks. On June 26, as part of the 2014 NBA draft, the Knicks selected Cleanthony Early as the 34th overall pick and Thanasis Antetokounmpo as the 51st overall pick, using the draft picks received in the trade from the Mavericks. The Knicks also acquired Louis Labeyrie, an additional second-round draft pick, after he was traded by the Pacers.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2014, it was {{reported}} that the army planned to encircle Aleppo and impose blockades and truces. It would also try to recapture Sheikh Najjar Industrial City to rebuild the economy and provide jobs. By October 2014, the army had seized Sheikh Najjar, reinforced Aleppo Central Prison and captured Handaraat, almost besieging rebel-held Aleppo. Tensions peaked in early April 2014, when a Syrian Republican Guard officer allegedly killed a Hezbollah commander during an argument over the opposition advance in al-Rashadin, and other pro-government militia groups sent as reinforcements, such as the National Defence Force, proved to be unreliable in combat. Effectively cutting off access was more difficult in Aleppo because rebels controlled more terrain there than in other cities. Rebels also have a strong presence in the countryside and around the border crossings with Turkey. In April 2014 government commanders inside the city <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> contrary to implementing such a strategy, [...] "the best [...] can do in Aleppo is just secure... positions".|$|E

He has said that there was [...] "a combination of reasons, really", and that the continuing demands of the music business had been [...] "becoming a chore, and not an inspiration anymore". In a 2004 interview on Larry King Live, he said [...] "A lot of people would have loved me to keep singing. You come to a point where you have sung, more or less... your whole repertoire and you want {{to get down to the}} job of living. You know, up until that point, I hadn't had a life.

2500|$|In Malcolm Gladwell's {{book on the}} {{cognitive}} function of snap judgments, Blink, well-known criminologist and police administrator James Fyfe said that Chicago police instructions in cases such as Russ's were [...] "very detailed." [...] He said that the record shows that the officers involved all broke procedure and let the situation become unnecessarily deadly for the suspect. For instance, after claiming to see Russ drive erratically, the officers engaged in a driving pursuit. The pursuit, labeled [...] "high-speed," [...] did not exceed 70 miles per hour, but Fyfe contends that the adrenaline rush of the chase, coupled with the officers reliance in their numbers, led to their ignoring impulses to maintain rational thinking in a potentially non-deadly situation. They speeded up a process that both allowed and required taking things more slowly and methodically. Russ's car spun out on the Ryan Expressway, at which point several officers quickly approached his vehicle. According to Gladwell, the false safety of numbers gave the three officers [...] "the bravado to rush the car." [...] Fyfe adds, [...] "The lawyers [...] <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> this was a fast-breaking situation. But it was only fast-breaking because the cops let it become one. He was stopped. He wasn't going anywhere." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nixon {{later told}} Soap Opera Digest that she always planned on pairing Dimitri with Erica, but held {{off to see}} if they worked well together. [...] "Long before their {{relationship}} started, viewers <b>were</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> Erica and Dimitri belong together," [...] she said. [...] "They have great chemistry and are very alike, kindred spirits." [...] Nixon wrote the beginning of the couple's story as a love-hate relationship where they both disliked each other. The dislike became an attraction that resulted in a [...] "tug-of-war" [...] type of story. [...] "We can't even define it as a romance," [...] Nader said. [...] "It has to be defined as a positioning of players. Dimitri is very well aware that he has to dance a little dance with her." [...] Nixon made the relationship different from Erica's other ones. In previous romances, she acted as the aggressor. In this one, Nixon positioned Dimitri as the one who pursued Erica and made the first sexual overtures. She also used the Erica and Dimitri relationship as a way of developing a new, more sexual side of Dimitri. Nader said, [...] "There was a part of Dimitri that he never explored before because he married so young. A part of him shut down. But now, there is a whole other aspect of his sexual nature that has been awakened and Erica is about that. [...] a lot more fire with her." ...|$|E
