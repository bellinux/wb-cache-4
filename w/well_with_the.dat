30|$|Reservoir {{permeability}}: {{as it is}} evident, <b>wells</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> permeability of 10 mD {{and above}} {{are more susceptible to}} the matrix acidizing operations, and <b>the</b> <b>wells</b> <b>with</b> permeability under one mD are considered as the best potential candidate for fracture acidizing.|$|R

40|$|There {{the study}} object is the hydrodynamics of gaseous and {{two-phase}} flow of multicomponent fluid in the inclined and vertical <b>wells</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> carrying off. The paper {{purpose is to}} study the motion of gaseous, two-phase multicomponent mixes <b>with</b> regard to <b>the</b> pool properties, <b>with</b> regard to <b>the</b> phase transitions, <b>with</b> regard to <b>the</b> effect influence in the zone near <b>the</b> bottom and <b>with</b> regard to <b>the</b> heat exchange <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rocks in the inclined and vertical <b>wells</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> added inclined carrying off. The mathematical model describing the two-phase one-rate, one-temperature flow has been adapted for the flow conditions in the inclined wells and in <b>the</b> <b>wells</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> carrying off. The influence of Joule - Thomson effect on the temperature of zone near the bottom has been taken account. The algorithms and the software package {{for the assessment of}} critical discharge of spouting wells and for the choice of means of spout control have been created on the basis of adapted model describing the two-phase flowAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|R
5|$|Archeology helps {{scholars}} {{better understand}} Jesus' social world. Recent archeological work, for example, indicates that Capernaum, a city important in Jesus' ministry, was poor and small, {{without even a}} forum or an agora. This archaeological discovery resonates <b>well</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> scholarly view that Jesus advocated reciprocal sharing among the destitute in that area of Galilee.|$|E
5|$|Cockroaches can {{be trapped}} in a deep, smooth-walled jar baited with food inside, placed so that {{cockroaches}} can reach the opening, for example with a ramp of card or twigs on the outside. An inch or so of water or stale beer (by itself a cockroach attractant) in the jar {{can be used to}} drown any insects thus captured. The method works <b>well</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> American cockroach, but less so with the German cockroach.|$|E

5|$|Dress {{rehearsal}} for the sketch went poorly. During rehearsal, Belushi was having difficulty correctly parodying {{the character of}} James T. Kirk as originally portrayed by actor William Shatner. Belushi had sat for several hours while being made up {{so that he would}} look the part. Sketch writer O'Donoghue was worried that the sketch was too long and might not go over <b>well</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> audience. He knew that Belushi was a fan of Star Trek, and had previously rescued sketches that others thought would flop, but O'Donoghue was nervous that Belushi {{would not be able to}} pull off a comedic performance on this occasion.|$|E

5|$|Eilífr Goðrúnarson's Christianity-influenced {{account of}} Urðarbrunnr (section 52 of Skáldskaparmál) {{associates}} the <b>well</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> south and Rome. Theories {{have been proposed}} that this description may have some relation to notions of the Jordan River due to phonetic and typological similarities perceived by Eilífr, though {{there may be no}} other causative connection. Eilífr is otherwise known as a pagan skald, and this selection has been theorized as describing that, due to directly associating Christ with the well, Christ had taken over responsibility of providence or fate.|$|E
5|$|Employees from Marvel Comics {{worked closely}} with Capcom's art design team to ensure that each {{character}} from their company was properly represented. As a result, several Marvel characters were modeled after their more recent comic book appearances. For example, Iron Man sports his Extremis Armor, while Wolverine wears his costume from Astonishing X-Men. The development team originally planned to have English and Japanese voice actors for all characters. Niitsuma eventually decided against it, stating that having the Marvel roster speaking Japanese did not mesh <b>well</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> characters' image.|$|E

Oz said {{he thought}} the routine was not a good fit for Saturday Night Live, and that the cartoon-style humor of their characters did not work <b>well</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> comedy of Saturday Night Live, much of which was initially derived from the Second City environment. Oz said he generally enjoyed working on Saturday Night Live and witnessing the skill of performers such as Andy Kaufman, Albert Brooks, John Belushi, Chevy Chase, and Dan Aykroyd.|$|E

5|$|In the {{periodic}} table of the elements, it is a d-block element and {{the second of the}} fourth-row transition elements. It {{is a member of the}} 7th period and belongs to the group 4 elements. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that rutherfordium behaves as the heavier homologue to hafnium in group 4. The chemical properties of rutherfordium are characterized only partly. They compare <b>well</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> chemistry of the other group 4 elements, even though some calculations had indicated that the element might show significantly different properties due to relativistic effects.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table of the elements, it is a d-block transactinide element. Hassium {{is a member of}} the 7th period and belongs to the group 8 elements: it is thus the sixth member of the 6d series of transition metals. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that hassium behaves as the heavier homologue to osmium in group 8. The chemical properties of hassium are characterized only partly, but they compare <b>well</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> chemistry of the other group 8 elements. In bulk quantities, hassium is expected to be a silvery metal that reacts readily with oxygen in the air, forming a volatile tetroxide.|$|E

It {{is a member of}} the 7th period and belongs to the group 6 elements as the fourth member of the 6d series of transition metals.

The chemical properties of seaborgium are characterized only partly, but they compare <b>well</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> chemistry of the other group 6 elements.|$|E
