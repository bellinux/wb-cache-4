5|$|Myst <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> hit, with critics lauding {{the ability}} of the game to immerse players in the fictional world. The game was the best-selling PC game until The Sims {{exceeded}} its sales in 2002. Myst helped drive adoption of the then-nascent CD-ROM format. Mysts success spawned four direct video game sequels as well as several spin-off games and novels.|$|E
5|$|In January 2009, Goldust {{participated in}} the annual Royal Rumble match and stared down Cody who {{ultimately}} eliminated him. Goldust married WWE Diva Aksana on 2 November 2010 on NXT, with Dusty and Cody in attendance. In 2013, Goldust <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> entrant for the Royal Rumble match on January 26 and was once again eliminated by his half-brother. Although he hinted at a possible feud with Cody, he later confirmed {{in an interview that}} his return was a one night only deal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} spring Augustus {{suffered}} a severe illness, and on his supposed deathbed made arrangements that would ensure {{the continuation of the}} Principate in some form, while allaying senators' suspicions of his anti-republicanism. Augustus prepared to hand down his signet ring to his favored general Agrippa. However, Augustus handed over to his co-consul Piso all of his official documents, an account of public finances, and authority over listed troops in the provinces while Augustus' supposedly favored nephew Marcellus came away empty-handed. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to many who believed Augustus would have named an heir to his position as an unofficial emperor.|$|E

5|$|Kirchner died on 27 October 2010, {{at the age}} of 60. The day was a {{national}} holiday for the INDEC to run {{a national}} census, so he was at home in El Calafate. After a cardiac arrest, Kirchner was rushed to a local hospital and was pronounced dead at 9:15a.m. He had undergone two medical procedures that year: surgery on his right carotid artery in February and an angioplasty in September. His death <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> for the Argentinian population, to whom he had always represented his heart problems as not very serious.|$|E
5|$|Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors holds a {{score of}} 82/100 at the review {{aggregator}} Metacritic, indicating generally favorable reviews. It was a commercial failure in Japan, with 27,762 copies sold in 2009 and an additional 11,891 in 2010, reaching a total of 39,653 copies sold. Meanwhile, American sales were described as being strong; according to Uchikoshi, this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise,</b> as the visual novel genre was seen as being particular to Japan and unlikely to be accepted overseas.|$|E
5|$|Portal is a single-player first-person action/puzzle {{game that}} was first {{available}} {{as part of}} The Orange Box. The game consists primarily {{of a series of}} puzzles that are solved by creating portals through which the player and simple objects can use the portals in order to reach an exit point while being ordered by an AI-programmed robot named GLaDOS throughout the game. The portal system and the unusual physics it creates are the emphasis of this game. Portal <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> favorite of The Orange Box, receiving widespread praise and several Game of the Year awards.|$|E

He was featured in a supporting role as Con Petropoulous, a kickboxing accountant who is the householder's son-in-law.

5|$|Black Swan had {{a limited}} release in select cities in North America on December 3, 2010, in 18 theaters and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> box office success. The film {{took in a}} total of $415,822 on its opening day, {{averaging}} $23,101 per theater. By the end of its opening weekend it grossed $1,443,809—$80,212 per theater. The per location average was the second highest for the opening weekend of 2010 behind The King's Speech. The film is Fox Searchlight Pictures' highest per-theater average gross ever, and it ranks 21st on the all-time list. On its second weekend the film expanded to 90 theaters, and grossed $3.3 million, ranking it as the sixth film at the box-office. In its third weekend, it expanded again to 959 theaters and grossed $8,383,479. The film went on to gross over $106 million in the United States and over $329 million worldwide.|$|E

5|$|During the pre-show of WrestleMania XXX, the Real Americans {{were the}} final team {{eliminated}} during a fatal-four-way {{match for the}} WWE Tag Team Championship. Swagger blamed Cesaro for the loss and put Cesaro in the Patriot Lock before Colter demanded that the duo shake hands. Cesaro instead retaliated with a Cesaro Swing on Swagger. Later during the pay-per-view, Cesaro <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> entrant in the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, which he won by last eliminating Big Show by body slamming {{him out of the}} ring, which mirrored Hulk Hogan's momentous body slam of André. Swagger retaliated by attacking Cesaro on the following Raw and then destroying the trophy, thus ending the stable.|$|E
5|$|Ferguson had a {{defensive}} selection dilemma {{ahead of the}} final, with both of his starting full-backs, Gabriel Heinze (ankle) and Gary Neville (groin), having suffered injuries. Neville eventually recovered {{enough to make the}} substitutes' bench, despite only playing in one of the team's last five games, but Heinze missed the game entirely, Mikaël Silvestre taking his place at left-back. Neville's absence meant that John O'Shea started at right-back. Neville was joined on the bench by winger Ryan Giggs and goalkeeper Tim Howard; Giggs' omission <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise,</b> and it meant that Darren Fletcher started on the right wing, while Ronaldo played on the left. Howard, on the other hand, had been competing for the number 1 jersey with Roy Carroll all season, and it was ultimately the Northern Irishman who was picked.|$|E
5|$|In September 2000, Crofts joined Gillingham as a trainee and was {{a regular}} in the club's youth and reserve teams during the 2000–01 season. At {{the end of the}} season, shortly before his 17th birthday, he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> {{inclusion}} in the first team squad for a match at home to Watford, and made his Football League debut as a late substitute, replacing Marlon King. The following season, he suffered a broken leg during a reserve team match and missed several months of the season. Although he returned to action in early 2002, his next appearance for the first team did not come until October, when he came on as a substitute in a League Cup match against Stockport County. This was to be his only senior appearance of the 2002–03 season. He finally secured a regular first team place {{towards the end of the}} following season, featuring regularly during March and April 2004.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{recession}} of the 1990s, downtown Albany was home to four Fortune 500 companies. After the death of Corning and the retirement of Congressman Sam Stratton, the political environment changes. Long-term office holders became rare in the 1980s. Local media began following the drama surrounding county politics (specifically that of the newly created county executive position); the loss of Corning (and eventually the machine) led {{to a lack of}} interest in city politics. The election of Gerald Jennings <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise,</b> and he served as Mayor from 1994 until his retirement at the end of 2013. His tenure essentially ended the political machine that had been in place since the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|The 1974 {{series in}} the West Indies was of five Tests. The West Indian team were {{regarded}} as the better side, and for them to only draw the series <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise.</b> After they won the first Test it had seemed that the series would become a one-sided contest. This Test was notable for a controversial Alvin Kallicharran run out that triggered protests. England managed to secure draws {{in the next three}} Tests, thanks to Dennis Amiss' 262 in the second Test and Keith Fletcher's 129 in the third, while rain prevented a result in the fourth Test. The last match at Queen's Park Oval was a close game, with England winning by 26 runs, primarily due to Tony Greig taking 13 wickets bowling off-spin and Boycott scoring 212 runs in the match. England thereby levelled the series, which finished 1–1.|$|E
5|$|The Punch-up in Piestany was {{a notable}} {{instance}} of fighting in international play. A 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships game between Canada and the Soviet Union {{was the scene}} of a bench-clearing brawl that lasted 20 minutes and prompted officials to turn off the arena lights in an attempt to stop it, forcing the IIHF to declare the game null and void. The fighting was particularly dangerous as fighting <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> and a custom unknown to the Soviet players, some of whom escalated the fighting beyond what was considered acceptable in North America. Both teams were ejected from the tournament, costing Canada an assured medal, and the Soviet team was barred from the end-of-tournament dinner.|$|E

5|$|The first {{experiment}} allowed {{detection of}} three atoms of 283Cn but also seemingly detected 1 atom of 287Fl. This result <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> given the transport {{time of the}} product atoms is ~2s, so the flerovium atoms produced should have decayed to copernicium before adsorption. In the second reaction, 2 atoms of 288Fl and possibly 1 atom of 289Fl were detected. Two of the three atoms displayed adsorption characteristics associated with a volatile, noble-gas-like element, which has been suggested but is not predicted by more recent calculations. These experiments provided independent confirmation for the discovery of copernicium, flerovium, and livermorium via comparison with published decay data. Further experiments in 2008 to confirm this important result detected a single atom of 289Fl, and supported previous data showing flerovium having a noble-gas-like interaction with gold.|$|E
5|$|The second {{qualifying}} period was fifteen minutes in length, {{and was used}} to set positions eleven through to sixteen. It was once again topped by Nico Rosberg, {{who was the first}} person to set a time under 1:43.000 all weekend. Meanwhile, Lewis Hamilton locked his brakes on the approach to turn 7, damaging his race tyres. Hamilton narrowly avoided elimination, setting a time good enough to proceed on his last attempt. Romain Grosjean was eliminated in eleventh, having overcome issues with his brake balance. Nico Hülkenberg <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> elimination in twelfth, having run consistently at the front of the field throughout the weekend. His elimination was attributed to a miscommunication between himself and his engineer over the amount of fuel he had on board. Carlos Sainz Jr. and Fernando Alonso finished thirteenth and fourteenth to fill the seventh row of the grid, ahead of Gutiérrez.|$|E
5|$|At the pre-E3 2005 press conference, Nintendo {{president}} Satoru Iwata {{announced that}} the next installment of Super Smash Bros. was soon to be in development for its next console and would be a launch title with Wi-Fi compatibility for online play. The announcement <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>surprise</b> to Sakurai, who left HAL Laboratory in 2003. He was not informed of Nintendo's intent to release another Smash Bros. game, {{despite the fact that}} Iwata told Sakurai shortly after his resignation from HAL that if a new Smash game was to be developed, he would want Sakurai to again serve as director. It was not until after the conference that Iwata requested that Sakurai hold a private meeting with him, where he was asked to be involved as Brawls director. Sakurai agreed to become director, and development of the game began in October 2005, when Nintendo opened a new office in Tokyo just for its production. Help from a variety of studios such as Monolith Soft and Paon was enlisted, with Game Arts as the main team in the preliminary development stages. In addition, several Smash Bros. staff members that resided {{in the area of the}} new office joined the project. Altogether, roughly 100 individuals worked on the project full-time, and were given access to all the original material and tools from the development of Melee, courtesy of HAL Laboratory.|$|E
