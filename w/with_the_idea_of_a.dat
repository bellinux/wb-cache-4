5|$|ATLs {{story is}} {{loosely based on}} {{material}} by producers Dallas Austin and Tionne Watkins, who set out to describe their experiences growing up {{on the south side}} of Atlanta in the early '90s. Watkins and producer Jody Gerson approached James Lassiter <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> story about a skating rink that many involved in the Atlanta music scene had started at, and how all of these people would attend the rink every Sunday night in their teen years.|$|E
5|$|From about 627 onwards, Edwin was {{the most}} {{powerful}} king among the Anglo-Saxons, ruling Bernicia, Deira and much of eastern Mercia, the Isle of Man, and Anglesey. His alliance with Kent, the subjection of Wessex, and his recent successes added to his power and authority. The imperium, as Bede calls it, that Edwin possessed was later equated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Bretwalda, a later concept invented by West Saxon kings in the 9th century. Put simply, success confirmed Edwin's overlordship, and failure would diminish it.|$|E

5|$|IDW Publishing {{released}} a four-issue prequel written by Chuck Dixon. Each issue focuses on Duke, Destro, The Baroness and Snake Eyes respectively. It began publication in March 2009. The weekly film adaptation {{was written by}} Denton J. Tipton and drawn by Casey Maloney. The film's universe continued in a limited series about Snake Eyes later in 2009: Ray Park enjoyed playing the character and approached writer Kevin VanHook and artist S. L. Gallant <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> comic further exploring his incarnation of the character.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{first learned}} of the novel in 2004 and {{approached}} McBride <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> film adaptation. In Europe, the film's development {{attracted the attention of}} Italian film producers Roberto Cicutto and Luigi Musini, who helped finance the $45 million production. A majority of the film was shot in Italy, on several locations affected by World War II. Other filming locations included New York, Louisiana and The Bahamas. Frequent Lee collaborator Terence Blanchard composed the score, and the visual effects were created by Industrial Light & Magic.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, in Middle English {{and early}} modern Scottish evidence, while still {{appearing}} as causes of harm and danger, elves appear clearly as human-like beings. They became associated with medieval chivalric romance traditions of fairies and particularly <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Fairy Queen. A propensity to seduce or rape people becomes increasingly {{prominent in the}} source material. Around the fifteenth century, evidence starts to appear for the belief that elves might steal human babies {{and replace them with}} changelings.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of Mariana {{is connected to}} Shakespeare's Measure for Measure; {{there is a direct}} quotation of Shakespeare's play in regards to a {{character of}} the same name. In Shakespeare's play, Mariana is rejected by the character Angelo and lives alone as she pines over her love. Tennyson's version is set in Lincolnshire, not Vienna as in the Shakespeare play. This makes the characters completely English. Additionally, the scene within the poem does not have any of the original context but the two works are connected in imagery <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dull life and a dejected female named Mariana.|$|E
5|$|The {{sporting}} event was started at Little Wittenham Bridge in 1984 by the lockkeeper, Lynn David, as a fund-raising {{event for the}} Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI). He noticed that people occasionally snapped sticks from nearby hedges to play the sport and he then came up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> competition to aid the charity. He put out a box of sticks and a collection box and it soon became an annual event.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the plans}} were officially shelved, locals {{continued}} to work <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> road connecting Averøy with the mainland. The toll company Atlanterhavsveien AS was established in 1970. Arne Rettedal, who was Minister of Local Government and Regional Development in the early 1980s, proposed that job creation funds could be allocated to road projects. The proposal was approved in 1983, after it had been supported by the municipalities of Averøy, Eide and Fræna. Construction started as a municipal road project on 1 August 1983, but progressed slowly. From 1 July 1986, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration took over the project, speeding up construction and allowing it to open on 7 July 1989. During construction, the area was hit by 12 hurricanes. The opening of the road allowed the Tøvik–Ørjavik Ferry to be terminated.|$|E

5|$|Before Sky made a formalised bid, Murdoch asked Chisholm {{to speak}} to Dyke about making a joint offer. The events of that meeting are vague, but what is clear was that Chisholm came to the {{decision}} of not working with ITV. He instead chose to pursue an alliance with the BBC, aware of the cultural importance of Match of the Day. In February 1992, Quinton met Murdoch over lunch to go over his expectations, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Premier League dedicated channel high on his priority. ITV had in the same month revealed plans to offer the league £80m over four years in exchange for exclusive rights. Dyke believed their deal would fend off BSkyB, but the BBC's quiet stance weakened ITV's position.|$|E
5|$|Citizen Kane eschews the {{traditional}} linear, chronological narrative, and tells Kane's story entirely in flashback using {{different points of}} view, many of them from Kane's aged and forgetful associates, the cinematic equivalent of the unreliable narrator in literature. Welles also dispenses <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single storyteller and uses multiple narrators to recount Kane's life. The use of multiple narrators was unheard of in Hollywood films. Each narrator recounts {{a different part of}} Kane's life, with each story partly overlapping. The film depicts Kane as an enigma, a complicated man who, in the end, leaves viewers with more questions than answers as to his character, such as the newsreel footage where he is attacked for being both a communist and a fascist.|$|E
5|$|During the 1973–1975 biennium, {{pressure}} {{was put on}} Kappa Kappa Psi chapters by their host institutions to admit women to comply with Title IX. The issue was again brought up at the 1975 national convention, and a joint committee consisting of {{an equal number of}} members from Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma was formed to explore the legal possibilities of a corporate merger of the two organizations, with the results of their investigation to be read at the 1977 convention. At the 1977 national convention, votes were cast by the Kappa Kappa Psi and Tau Beta Sigma delegations for a merger—Kappa Kappa Psi voted 211 against, 9 for; Tau Beta Sigma voted 104 against, 4 for. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> merger soundly defeated, the delegation voted to remove all references to gender from the constitution, allowing women to become active members in full and regular standing.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by Motohide Eshiro. Eshiro had come up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new adventure game about Ace Attorney characters while working on Trials and Tribulations, and Yamazaki had the idea to have it be about deductive reasoning and crime scene investigation. The game was specifically designed {{to be different from}} previous Ace Attorney titles, with a larger focus on the environment. The development team had originally considered using Ema Skye, a character from earlier games in the series, as the lead character, but used Miles Edgeworth instead because of his popularity. They aimed to have players be immersed in the game and feel like they are Edgeworth, as opposed to previous Ace Attorney games, where they felt players merely could identify with the lead characters; to do this, they included direct control of Edgeworth, and a gameplay element that involves connecting his thoughts.|$|E
5|$|Wanting {{readers to}} know that the stone mask and its powers would be what would drive the plot, Araki started the manga with a prologue {{involving}} the mask, focusing on communicating the mood, rather than the standard way of opening a manga with an introduction of the protagonist. The concept of the Hamon power was created as he thought about how to create drawings that show the invisible; he came up <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> character punching a frog, which was left unharmed, while the rock underneath cracked open, thus showing the supernatural power of the character's abilities. It was also influenced by his love for karate manga, with the supernatural moves used within them.|$|E
