50|$|The J-2 has a {{constant}} chord, one piece low <b>wing.</b> Its <b>inner</b> <b>panels</b> have no dihedral but the outer ones are set at 4°. Both the main box spar and the rear spar have spruce booms and plywood webs. The leading edge is ply covered and fitted with fixed slots. The wing, including ailerons and flaps is Dacron covered overall. The empennage of the J-2 is conventional and cantilever, with the horizontal tail mounted {{on top of}} the fuselage; both fin and rudder are swept, the latter only slightly. The fixed surfaces are ply covered but control surfaces are fabric covered. The elevator has a trim tab.|$|R
50|$|The CAMS 54 was a single-bay biplane {{with equal}} span, {{rectangular}} plan wings mounted without stagger. The upper wing was in three parts, a short centre section and two long outer panels; the lower <b>wing</b> had two <b>inner</b> <b>panels,</b> {{mounted on the}} upper fuselage and strengthened by short, parallel pairs of struts to mid-fuselage, and two outer panels. Only the lower wing had dihedral. Both upper and lower wings carried narrow-chord ailerons, linked externally by wires, out to their tips. Both were wooden structures based on pairs of spruce box spars and fabric covered, braced together with parallel pairs of interplane struts to the spars.|$|R
25|$|The Bf 109H was {{intended}} to be a high-altitude fighter, developed from the F-series. The wingspan was increased through the addition of new, constant-chord <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> <b>panels</b> to 11.92m (39.11ft), and the widened stabilizer again received a supporting strut leading from the fuselage, like the B through E models. Maximum speed was 750km/h (470mph) at 10,100m (33,140ft). A small number of Bf 109 H-1s were built, flying several sorties over Britain and France. Bf 109H-2 and H-5 developments were also planned, but the entire H-series was scrapped because of wing flutter problems.|$|R
2500|$|Both designs used a plywood covered D-box {{forward of}} the spar, with fabric {{covering}} behind, and their 2.50m (8ft2in) half span, parallel chord <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> <b>panels</b> were similar, though close to the fuselage the Wien's wing was strengthened with full chord plywood skin. [...] The V-form bracing struts linked the extremes of these panels to the lower fuselage. The extra span of the Wien was in the double straight tapered outer panels, which continued out to finer, rounded tips. [...] Ailerons occupied the whole trailing edge of these sections.|$|R

50|$|Meanwhile, Dorfmann {{has been}} working on a radical idea: He {{believes}} they can build a new aircraft from the wreckage. The C-82 has twin booms extending rearwards from each engine and connected by the horizontal stabilizer. Dorfmann's plan is to attach the outer panel of the right wing to the left engine, left boom and left wing outer panel, discarding the center fuselage and both <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> <b>panels</b> of the aircraft, having the passengers traveling on top of the wings. Harris and Moran believe he is either joking or delusional. The argument is complicated by a personality clash between Towns, who is a proud old traditionalist aviator, and Dorfmann, a young, equally-proud technician. Moran, a good-natured man suffering from alcoholism, struggles to keep the peace.|$|R
2500|$|Design was {{initiated}} by Junkers Chief Designer Ernst Zindel. He was assisted by Wilhelm Heinrich Evers and American engineer Alfred Gassner. Evers and Gassner had worked together at Fokkòer Aircraft Corporation of America where Gassner had been Chief Engineer. [...] Junkers presented their initial design in June 1936, and were given clearance to build two prototypes (Werknummer 4941 and 4942). The first two aircraft {{were to have}} a range of 2,000km (1,240mi) and were to be powered by two DB 600s. Three further aircraft, Werknummer 4943, 4944 and 4945, were to be powered by Jumo 211 engines. The first two prototypes, Ju 88 V1 and V2, differed from the V3, V4 and V5 in that the latter three models were equipped with three defensive armament positions {{to the rear of the}} cockpit, and were able to carry two 1,000kg (2,200lb) bombs, one under each <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> <b>panel.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Rebell had low-mid set wings {{built around}} a single wooden spar and wood covered. They had {{dihedral}} only on the outer panels, each 3.75 m (12 ft 3.5 in) long and foldable for storage. The fuselage was a steel tube structure, wood covered and had a roughly rectangular cross-section. The canopy was quite long and normally enclosed just a single seat, but there was space to place a second seat in tandem behind the first. The engine, originally a 40 kW (54 hp) Hirth M28 twin cylinder unit, was placed over the wing behind the cockpit with the propeller shaft {{at the top of}} the fuselage, locating the propeller just behind the trailing edge of the wing. Aft, the fuselage became a low-set boom, bearing wooden tail surfaces including a swept, straight edged vertical tail with a long dorsal fillet. The Rebell had a recessed monowheel undercarriage assisted by a tailwheel and two stabilizing wheels mounted at the extreme <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|R

2500|$|The newer {{information}} {{is supported by}} the fate of 63-13287. On 14 December 1965, operating TDY from Incirlik Air Base in Turkey as [...] "Big Rib 06", it disappeared during a mission over the Black Sea whose route passed through telemetry range for Soviet ICBMs. What actually happened is still uncertain. There was speculation that the aircraft had been shot down by a Soviet S-75 Dvina (NATO designation [...] "SA-2 Guideline") surface-to-air missile, but the official statement by the USAF was that the aircraft was on its third pass along its route when it deviated from its flight plan, orbiting and spiraling down to below minimum radar tracking altitude, indicating that the aircraft crew had probably perished from an oxygen system failure. Although searches for the wreckage continued until 28 December, only small bits and pieces of it were recovered, although unsubstantiated reports asserted that the two crew members had been captured alive by the Soviets. However one of the recovered pieces was an <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> <b>panel</b> that a team of structural experts concluded was struck by an object, likely a missile. The crew was declared dead after being missing for six months. The Soviets used the incident to argue successfully against U.S. intelligence-gathering missions originating from Turkish air bases.|$|R
50|$|The CL-1200 was to {{have kept}} the basic F-104 {{fuselage}} structure, increased in length to provide 46% extra internal fuel capacity. The fuselage extension consisted of a 30 in plug between the standard F-104 front and center fuselage sections. Unlike the F-104, the rear fuselage section was to be constructed using titanium alloy for the frames, longerons and skinning around the jet exhaust. The major revision of the design was a shoulder-mounted wing of 53% larger area which was also moved further aft. The new wing had a span of 29 ft and still featured leading and trailing edge flaps but gained new leading edge extensions, while the 10° anhedral of the Starfighter was retained. The flap system {{was designed to be}} either manual or automatic in operation; the system configuring them as required for load factor, airspeed and altitude. The new <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> <b>panels</b> featured an additional trailing edge flap which doubled the area in comparison to the F-104; this would have improved short-field performance and lowered the landing speed. The boundary layer control system of the F-104 was deemed unnecessary due to the increased flap area and was omitted. The outer wing panels were virtually identical to those of the F-104.|$|R

50|$|In {{an effort}} to produce an {{advanced}} four engined strategic bomber for the Luftwaffe, a proposal was made by Junkers during 1944 to create a simplified design by combining sub-assemblies of the Ju 188, Ju 288, and Ju 388 (especially its cockpit) to new <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> <b>panels</b> and midsection fuselage assemblies. This {{would result in a}} sleek aircraft with a length of almost 20.4 m (67 ft) and a wingspan of nearly 31.4 m (103 ft). The Ju 488 was to be initially powered by four BMW 801J radial engines, with each engine nacelle having one standard Ju 88-style rearwards-retracting single strut main landing gear unit, still rotating through 90° to lie flat (with the mainwheel above the end of the strut) within each of the quartet of nacelles. Later versions — as with a growing number of late-war German twin and multi-engined combat aircraft design proposals — were to be powered by four of the very troublesome 24-cylinder Jumo 222 liquid-cooled multibank inline engines. The first two prototypes, Ju 488 V401 and V402 had fuselage sections constructed at the Latécoère factory in France, while the other components were being prepared at Junkers factories in Germany. The Ju 488 V401 and V402 fuselages were completed by 1944, but were damaged by the French Resistance on 16 July 1944. Construction of four more prototypes, the V403 to V406, continued at low priority and were not finished {{by the end of the}} war.|$|R

50|$|The Carat was {{designed}} by Technoflug around the wings and horizontal tail of the Schempp-Hirth Discus sailplane, marrying these to a new fuselage, fin, undercarriage and engine.. Structurally the aircraft {{is a mixture of}} fibreglass and carbon fibre composites. The wings have PVC foam cores. In plan the wings have parallel chord <b>inner</b> <b>panels</b> and two outer sections of increasing straight taper. Winglets are an option. Schempp-Hirth type airbrakes are mounted on the upper surfaces of the <b>inner</b> <b>panels,</b> with turbulators on the underside to ensure a controlled boundary layer transition from laminar to turbulent flow without separation.

50|$|On one of {{his regular}} visits to German glider builders, Teichfuss watched the {{construction}} of high performance aircraft like Hans Jacobs' DFS Reiher. The Turbine design, begun in 1938, was a high performance machine which showed Jakob's influence but was rather simpler to construct. It was a mid wing cantilever monoplane with gull wings of strongly straight tapered, elliptically tipped plan. The <b>inner</b> <b>panels</b> extended over rather more than one third span and were mounted with about 10° of dihedral; there was no dihedral outboard but the trailing edges of these outer panels was completely occupied with ailerons. There were spoilers on the <b>inner</b> <b>panels</b> at about mid-chord.|$|R

50|$|The {{new version}} {{included}} a lengthened fuselage and new, automatic leading edge slats, {{both of which}} had been tested on Me 210s and were found to dramatically improve handling. The slats had originally been featured on the earliest Me 210 models, but had been removed on production models due to poor handling. When entering a sharp turn, the slats had a tendency to open, {{due in part to the}} turn causing a drop in air pressure at the leading edge of the wings, analogous to the low pressure activation the slats were designed for in a slow landing approach (this problem was first observed on the Bf 109V14 and V15 prototypes for the Bf 109E), which added to the problems keeping the aircraft flying smoothly. However, when the problems with the general lateral instability were addressed, this was no longer a real problem. The wing panels of the earlier Me 210 had been designed with a planform geometry that placed the aerodynamic center in a rearwards direction in comparison to the earlier Bf 110, giving the outer sections of the wing planform beyond each engine nacelle a slightly greater, 12.6° leading edge sweepback angle than the inner panels' 6.0° leading edge sweep angle. This resulted in unreasonable handling characteristics in flight for the original Me 210 design. The new Me 410 outer wing panels had their planform geometry revised to bring the aerodynamic center further forwards in comparison to the Me 210, thus making the leading edge sweepback of the outer panels identical to the <b>inner</b> <b>wing</b> <b>panels</b> with both having identical 5.5° sweepback angles, which improved handling.|$|R
