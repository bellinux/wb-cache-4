Both market-driven loan rates and conservation reserve programs appear to have helped volatility revert to lower levels since the mid- 1980 s (12 / 23 / 85 - 12 / 30 / 93).

40|$|Abstract: Dicoccum wheat is nutritionally and therapeutically {{superior}} {{as compared}} to commercially available <b>wheats.</b> <b>Spot</b> blotch caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana {{is one of the}} major disease that limits the cultivation of dicuccom wheat. As there are resistance sources among durum wheat which is also a tetraploid, it is easy to transfer spot blotch disease resistance from durum wheat to dicoccum wheat. In this investigation, RAPD markers were used to detect the adequate and useful polymorphism among resistance (HD 4502) and susceptible (DDK 1001) genotypes of wheat. Thirty two RAPD primers were used to detect the polymorphism among plants. Twelve primers out of 32 decamer primers produced polymorphic bands between resistant and susceptible genotypes. Five RAPD primers generated susceptible genotype (DDK 1001) specific bands whereas seven the remaining produced resistant genotype (HD 4502) specific bands. These polymorphic primers were further used to screen the F 2 mapping population developed by crossing DDK 1001 x HD 4502 and further to tag spot blotch disease resistance which helps in marker assisted selection...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Spot blotch {{caused by}} Bipolaris sorokiniana is gaining {{importance}} especially in North Western and North Eastern Plain Zones (NWPZ and NEPZ) of India. The experiment {{was conducted at}} Crop Research Centre, Pantnagar in Tarai region of Uttaranchal by taking three resistant i. e. WH 581, PBW 343 and PBW 373, three susceptible varieties, UP 2338, PBW 154 and Sonalika, and their F " F 2, B, and B 2 generations. The average yield and 1000 -grain weight losses due to spot blotch were 17. 63 and 19. 35 per cent, respectively in different generations. The grain yield loss ranged from 7. 63 to 36. 66 per cent while reduction in 1000 -grain weight ranged from 7. 07 to 43. 65 per cent.

40|$|Spot bloth {{caused by}} Bipolaris sorokiniana is an {{important}} wheat desease mainly in hot and humid regions. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the response of wheat to different sources and modes of Si application, as related to the severity of <b>wheat</b> <b>spot</b> blotch and plant growth, in two Si-deficient Latosols (Oxisols). An greenhouse experiment was arranged in a 2 x 5 factorial completely randomized design, with eight replications. The treatments consisted of two soils (Yellow Latosol and Red Latosol) and five Si supply modes (no Si application; Si applied as calcium silicate and monosilicic acid to the soil; and Si applied as potassium silicate or monosilicic acid to wheat leaves). No significant differences were observed between the two soils. When Si was applied to the soil, regardless the Si source, the disease incubation period, the shoot dry matter yield and the Si content in leaves were greater. Additionally, the final spot blotch severity was lower and the area under the spot blotch disease progress curve and the leaf insertion angle in the plant were smaller. Results of Si foliar application were similar to those observed in the control plants...|$|R

PPSMV was transmitted mechanically in sap of SMD-affected pigeonpea leaves to Nicotiana benthamiana. Ultrastructural studies of symptom-bearing leaves of two pigeonpea cultivars, (ICP 8863 and ICP 2376) and N. benthamiana infected with PPSMV, detected quasi-spherical, membrane bound bodies (MBBs) of c. 100 – 150 nm and amorphous electron-dense material (EDM).

We discuss whether or not extensive use of fungicides in agricultural environments is related to the occurrence of fungicide resistance in clinical environments.

We characterized 231 single spore isolates from Latvia (n = 15), Lithuania (n = 107), and Romania (n = 109) for Ptr ToxA and Ptr ToxB genes using two genes specific primers.

Application of this compound in combination with fungicides shifted fungicide-resistant P. tritici-repentis isolates back to normal sensitivity levels and prevented infection of wheat leaves.

40|$|The <b>wheat</b> tan <b>spot</b> fungus (Pyrenophora tritici-repentis) {{produces}} a well-characterized host-selective toxin (HST) known as Ptr ToxA, which induces necrosis in genotypes that harbor the Tsn 1 gene on chromosome 5 B. In previous work, {{we showed that}} the Stagonospora nodorum isolate Sn 2000 {{produces a}}t least 2 HSTs (SnTox 1 and SnToxA). Sensitivity to SnTox 1 is governed by the Snn 1 gene on chromosome 1 B in wheat. SnToxA is encoded by a gene {{with a high degree}} of similarity to the Ptr ToxA gene. Here, we evaluate toxin sensitivity and resistance to S. nodorum blotch (SNB) caused by Sn 2000 in a recombinant inbred population that does not segregate for Snn 1. Sensitivity to the Sn 2000 toxin preparation cosegregated with sensitivity to Ptr ToxA at the Tsn 1 locus. Tsn 1 -disrupted mutants were insensitive to both Ptr ToxA and SnToxA, suggesting that the 2 toxins are functionally similar, because they recognize the same locus in the host to induce necrosis. The locus harboring the tsn 1 allele underlies a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for resistance to SNB caused by Sn 2000, and explains 62 % of the phenotypic variation, indicating that the toxin is an important virulence factor for this fungus. The Tsn 1 locus and several minor QTLs together explained 77 % of the phenotypic variation. Therefore, the Tsn 1 -ToxA interaction in the wheat-S. nodorum pathosystem parallels that of the wheat-tan spot system, and the wheat Tsn 1 gene serves as a major determinant for susceptibility to both SNB and tan spot...|$|R

To get {{a deeper understanding of}} fungal effectors, we determined by NMR spectroscopy the 3 -dimensional structures of the Magnaporthe oryzae effectors AVR 1 -CO 39 and AVR-Pia. Despite a lack of sequence similarity, both proteins have very similar 6 beta-sandwich structures that are stabilized in both cases by a disulfide bridge between 2 conserved cysteins located in similar positions of the proteins. Structural similarity searches revealed that AvrPiz-t, another effector from M. oryzae, and ToxB, an effector of the <b>wheat</b> tan <b>spot</b> pathogen Pyrenophora tritici-repentis have the same structures suggesting the existence of a family of sequence-unrelated but structurally conserved fungal effectors that we named MAX-effectors (Magnaporthe Avrs and ToxB like). Structure-informed pattern searches strengthened this hypothesis by identifying MAX-effector candidates in a broad range of ascomycete phytopathogens. Strong expansion of the MAX-effector family was detected in M. oryzae and M. grisea where they seem to be particularly important since they account for 5 - 10 % of the effector repertoire and 50 % of the cloned avirulence effectors. Expression analysis indicated that the majority of M. oryzae MAX-effectors are expressed specifically during early infection suggesting important functions during biotrophic host colonization. We hypothesize that the scenario observed for MAX-effectors can serve as a paradigm for ascomycete effector diversity and that the enormous number of sequence-unrelated ascomycete effectors may in fact belong to a restricted set of structurally conserved effector families...|$|R
40|$|A cursory {{glance at}} old {{textbooks}} of plant pathology {{reveals that the}} diseases which are the current scourge of agriculture {{in many parts of}} the world are a different set from those that were prominent 50 or 100 years ago. Why have these new diseases arisen? The traditional explanations subscribe to the “nature abhors a vacuum” principle—that control of one disease creates the condition for the emergence of a replacement—but does little to explain why the new pathogen succeeds. The emergence of a new disease requires a series of conditions and steps, including the enhanced fecundity of the new pathogen, enhanced survival from season to season, and spread around the world. Recently, evidence was obtained that <b>wheat</b> tan <b>spot</b> emerged through a lateral gene transfer event some time prior to 1941. Although there have been sporadic and persistent reports of lateral gene transfer between and into fungal plant pathogens, most examples have been dismissed through incomplete evidence. The completion of whole genome sequences of an increasing number of fungal pathogens no longer allows such proposed cases of lateral gene transfer to be dismissed so easily. How frequent are lateral gene transfers involving fungal plant pathogens, and can this process explain the emergence of many of the new diseases of the recent past? Many of the apparently new diseases are dependant on the expression of host-specific toxins. These are enigmatic molecules whose action requires the presence of plant genes with products that specifically encode sensitivity to the toxin and susceptibility to the disease. It is also notable that many new diseases belong to the fungal taxon dothideomycetes. This review explores the coincidence of new diseases, interspecific gene transfer, host-specific toxins, and the dothideomycete class...|$|R

After fermentation, the dough was freeze-dried, mixed with buckwheat flour {{at a ratio of}} 3 : 7, and used to produce the “fusilli” type Italian pasta. Pasta without prefermentation was used as the control. Ingredients and pastas were characterized for compositional analysis. As shown by two-dimensional electrophoresis, 92 of the 130 durum <b>wheat</b> gliadin <b>spots</b> were hydrolyzed almost totally during fermentation by lactic acid bacteria. Mass spectrometry matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight and reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography analyses confirmed the hydrolysis of gliadins. As shown by immunological analysis by R 5 -Western blot, the concentration of gluten decreased from 6280 ppm in the control pasta to 1045 ppm in the pasta fermented with lactic acid bacteria. Gliadins were extracted from fermented and nonfermented durum wheat dough semolina and used to produce a peptic-tryptic (PT) digest for in vitro agglutination tests on cells of human origin. The whole PT digests did not cause agglutination. Affinity chromatography on Sepharose- 6 -B mannan column separated the PT digests in three fractions. Fraction C showed agglutination activity. The minimal agglutinating activity of fraction C from the PT digest of fermented durum wheat semolina was ca. 80 times higher than that of durum wheat semolina. Pasta was subjected to sensory analysis: The scores for stickiness and firmness were slightly lower than those found for the pasta control. Odor and flavor did not differ between the two types of pasta. These results showed that a pasta biotechnology that uses a prefermentation of durum wheat semolina by selected lactic acid bacteria and tolerated buckwheat flour could be considered as a novel tool to potentially decrease gluten intolerance and the risk of gluten contamination in gluten-free products...|$|R

40|$|Stagonospora nodorum blotch, {{causal agent}} Phaeosphaeria nodorum, {{is part of}} the <b>wheat</b> leaf <b>spotting</b> complex and is a major disease in Saskatchewan and other wheat growing regions. Host {{resistance}} results from insensitivity to proteinaceous host-selective toxins produced by P. nodorum. Different toxin combinations amongst individuals in the P. nodorum population are expected to contribute to host specificity. Genetic variation in the pathogen populations needs to be well understood in order to develop cultivars with durable resistance. The presence of host specificity was investigated by evaluating the reaction of 49 isolates on 16 wheat lines at the second leaf stage. ANOVA revealed a significant interaction between the isolates and wheat lines indicating host specificity is present in this pathosystem. Based on differences in virulence, the 49 isolates could be placed into 3 clusters that could be further sub-divided into 9 groups. The present data is consistent with a toxin-based, inverse gene-for-gene model. Another aspect of this study looked at the genetics of resistance to Stagonospora nodorum blotch. Breeding resistant varieties is desirable but requires an understanding of the genetic basis of resistance. Resistance to Phaeosphaeria nodorum isolates Kelvington and 06 -SN- 002 was studied in the wheat population Altar Synthetic/Kenyon. This population consisted of 96 F 6 -derived recombinant inbred lines. The population was evaluated for disease reaction in a RCBD experiment with 3 replicates inoculated at the second leaf stage. The second leaf was rated on a 1 to 5 scale at 7 days post inoculation. When inoculated with isolate 06 -SN- 002, Altar Synthetic and Kenyon had intermediate disease reactions of 2. 9 and 3. 0, respectively. When inoculated with Kelvington, Altar Synthetic was resistant (rating of 1. 8) and Kenyon was highly susceptible (rating of 4. 6).

40|$|Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, {{the causal}} {{organism}} of the necrotrophic foliar <b>wheat</b> disease tan <b>spot</b> [also known as yellow (leaf) spot in Australia] {{is an important}} disease in Australia and {{in many parts of}} the world. North American isolates of the pathogen have been shown to produce combinations of three host-specific toxins, ToxA, ToxB and ToxC. Each toxin interacts with a host sensitivity locus, respectively Tsn 1, Tsc 2 and Tsc 1. The virulence of an isolate is partially correlated with the presence of these toxins and resistance in the host is associated with absence of the sensitivity loci. Breeding for resistance to tan spot can, therefore, be aided by knowledge of the prevalence of the toxin-encoding genes in local pathogen populations. Two of the toxins, A and B, are encoded by known genes and molecular tests for the genes have been developed. We screened a diverse collection of 119 tan spot isolates collected between 1984 and 2008 and from all affected regions of Australia (Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia).

40|$|Fungal {{diseases}} {{are a major}} issue in wheat growing areas of the prairies and can result in significant yield losses if left unchecked. Some of the most common diseases affecting <b>wheat</b> are leaf <b>spots,</b> caused by several pathogen species that make up the leaf spotting complex, including tan <b>spot</b> of <b>wheat,</b> caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis. The optimal timing to apply fungicide to protect <b>wheat</b> against leaf <b>spots</b> is during the flag leaf stage (ZGS 39), however, another disease, fusarium head blight (FHB), is also {{a major issue in}} wheat grown in the prairies and is capable of devastating an entire crop. The optimal timing to apply fungicide to control FHB is during anthesis (ZGS 60). It is also possible for pathogen species to become insensitive to fungicides over time if they are frequently exposed to the same class of fungicide, especially site specific fungicides such as quinone outside inhibititors (QoI) like pyraclostrobin or demethylation inhibitors (DMI) like propiconazole. It is therefore imperative to limit the amount of fungicide applied to fields to reduce the exposure to pathogens that may lead to insensitivity. The objective of this project was to evaluate the efficacy of applying synthetic fungicides and a biofungicide at two times, flag leaf emergence and anthesis, to determine if application at either of these timings would adequately control leaf spots. Five fungicide products or product combinations were applied at two growth stages, as single or double applications at five locations in 2013 and 2014 using the wheat cultivar Carberry. The results showed that applying fungicide at anthesis stage provided adequate control of leaf spots compared to applying at flag leaf stage. Although applying fungicide at anthesis stage resulted in a higher incidence of leaf spots when disease pressure was high, yield was the same whether fungicide was applied at flag leaf stage or anthesis stage. The second objective {{of this study was to}} determine the baseline sensitivity of the Pyrenophora tritici-repentis populations from Alberta and Saskatchewan to two fungicide modes of action, QoIs and DMIs, on spore germination and radial growth on fungicide amended solid agar media. Seventy-one isolates were collected from Saskatchewan in 2013 - 2014 and AB in 2010 and radial growth measured on V 8 -PDA media amended with propiconazole, pyraclostrobin and pyraclostrobin with SHAM at five different concentrations. Spore germination was also determined by counting the number of germinated spores in a 5 µL mL- 1 spore-water suspension treated with 10 µL of 10 x diluted lactophenol. The effective concentration to reduce spore germination by 50 % (EC 50) values were determined by calculating the number of spores that successfully germinated against the total number of spores. There were also five different fungicide concentrations for the spore germination treatments. The results of the study created a baseline for pyraclostrobin and propiconazole sensitivity and it was determined that QoI and DMI insensitivity has not occurred in the P. tritici-repentis population in Saskatchewan and Alberta...|$|R
40|$|The {{optimisation}} {{and implementation}} of a molecular fingerprinting system and its ultimate use in marker assisted selection of identified maize and wheat genotypes for the CSIR are described in this dissertation. The Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) method was optimised for the maize trait gamete sterility, and for the <b>wheat</b> traits eye <b>spot</b> resistance and cytoplasmic male fertility. Maize and wheat DNA were extracted from selected genotypes employing standardized protocols. A commercial AFLP kit was used to obtain suitable fingerprint fragments for analysis. As this kit was not designed for very large genomes, conditions for the large wheat genome required optimisation. AFLP fingerprints generated from the different genotypes of maize and wheat were evaluated for potentially trait linked markers. Polymorphic fragments were identified by their presence in genotypes containing the trait of interest, and their absence from fingerprints of genotypes that did not contain the trait of interest. These amplification products were identified and selected as possible markers. These potential markers were converted to Sequence Characterised Amplified Regions (SCARs) by cloning the selected amplification products to T-tailed pSK vector, and subsequent sequencing of the fragment. Primers were designed to recognise these amplification regions in the tested genotypes. Primers were optimally designed to include or exclude the restriction sites of the enzymes {{at each end of}} the amplified fragments and annealing temperatures normalised for each of the primer sets. The primers were validated by amplification of the tested genotypes with the primer sets at specific reaction and temperature cycling conditions. For maize, two primer sets were identified that could be developed to identify gamete sterility genotypes. In the case of wheat, one primer set for each of the traits spot resistance and cytoplasmic male fertility was identified for their potential use as markers.

Isolates of P. tritici-repentis have been {{reported}} to be both phytopathogenic and mycotoxigenic. This research investigates the influence of nitrogen sources on growth and production of mycotoxins by eight different isolates of P. tritici-repentis. A synthetic agar medium (SAM) was used with different nitrogen sources, both inorganic [(NH 4 Cl, NH 4 NO 3 and (NH 4) 2 SO 4) ] and organic (l-alanine, l-histidine, and l-lysine), at a concentration of 37. 5 mmolL− 1. Individual isolates exhibited different growth rates that varied according to the nitrogen source added to the medium. The choice of nitrogen source also had a major effect on production of the mycotoxins emodin, catenarin and islandicin. The highest concentrations of emodin, 54. 40 ± 4. 46 μgg− 1, 43. 07 ± 23. 39 μgg− 1 and 28. 91 ± 4. 64 μgg− 1 of growth medium, were produced on the complex medium (V 8 -potato dextrose agar) by the isolates Alg-H 2, 331 - 2 and TS 93 - 71 B, respectively. A relatively high concentration of emodin also was produced by isolates Az 35 - 5 (28. 29 ± 4. 71 μgg− 1 of medium) and TS 93 - 71 B (27. 03 ± 4. 09 μgg− 1 of medium) on synthetic medium supplemented with l-alanine. The highest concentrations of catenarin (174. 54 ± 14. 46 μgg− 1 and 104. 87 ± 6. 13 μgg− 1 of medium) were recorded for isolates TS 93 - 71 B and Alg-H 2 on synthetic medium supplemented with l-alanine and NH 4 Cl, respectively. The highest concentration of islandicin (4. 64 ± 0. 36 μgg− 1 medium) was observed for isolate 331 - 2 in the presence of l-lysine. There was not a close relationship between mycelial growth and mycotoxin production by the fungal isolates.

40|$|Leaf blights such as tan <b>spot</b> of <b>wheat</b> (Pyrenophora tritici-repentis) {{and spot}} blotch of barley (Cochliobolus sativus) {{are among the}} main {{constraints}} in achieving high and stable yields and are the main concerns among the several intrinsic drawbacks of narrow cropping sequencesas both are residue borne. The development of useful and durable resistance against prevalent races requires detailed information on the virulence diversity of the pathogen {{and the type of}} resistances available in the host. Thus, the focus of this thesis was the study of diversity in virulence of P. tritici-repentis and C. sativus, andfor the latter it was also analyzed the possibility to establish an international differential set like the one already existing for tan spot. In a three-year study of the race structure of tan spot in South America (Chapter 2) only races 1 and 2 were found. This low level of pathogenic diversity found was somewhat expected, since the bread wheat grown in this region has a narrow genetic diversity with respect to tan spot resistance. In contrast, in Morocco (Chapter 3), we found races 1, 5, 6 and 7 among 135 isolates. Races 5 (ToxB producer) and 6 (ToxB+ToxC producer) represented 90 %of the isolates tested. The identification of races 1 and 7 that both produce the otherwise not present ToxA needs to be carefully considered since P. tritici-repentis has the ability to generate new combinations of virulence increasing its race diversity. Aggressiveness to 28 barley genotypes was high among 44 Uruguayan Cochliobolus sativus isolates collected between 1993 - 2008 and aggressiveness profiles were very diverse (Chapter 4). In a more extensive study (Chapter 5) 322 isolates collected between 2001 and 2010 were characterized for their quantitative interactions with 35 barley lines. Data were analyzed with Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components (HCPC) resulting in nine clusters of lines and six isolate clusters. Reducing the number of isolates to 147 based on redundant infection responses resulted in eight line clusters and seven isolate clusters. Despite some clear isolate specific interactions the overall host-pathogen interactions were quantitative and {{there is no indication that}} a common differential set to monitor worldwide virulence changes can be identified. Even without true differentials it will be useful to identify a set of genetically broad barleys for international use by testing with C. sativus isolates of several geographic origins across environments. Further research should aim at characterizing the genetic diversity and population structure of C. sativus and to provide an insight into the phylogenetic relationships among the aggressiveness groups identified of this economically important barley and wheat pathogen using molecular markers. For resistance testing in Uruguay, a range of the most aggressive and representative isolates should be used to provide the most effective screening of lines in barley breeding programs. In conclusion, breeding for resistance to tan <b>spot</b> in <b>wheat</b> and <b>spot</b> blotch in barley need to follow different pathways. Effective and sustainable disease management will come from a holistic approach where crop resistance goes hand in hand with diversification based on rotation involving non-cereal host crops as well as potentially cultivar mixtures...|$|R
