5|$|Although the puffball was {{originally}} described as new to science by Elizabeth Eaton Morse in 1935, {{it was not}} published validly until 60 years later. The species is named for its resemblance to Calvatia sculpta, from which it can be usually distinguished in the field by its less prominent pyramidal warts, and microscopically by the antler-like branches of its capillitium (thread-like material among the spores). Calbovista subsculpta is a good edible species while its interior flesh (the gleba) is still firm and <b>white.</b> <b>As</b> <b>the</b> puffball matures, its insides become dark brown and powdery from mature spores.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder and Scully are called in to {{investigate}} the unexplained deaths of several African and African-American people whose skin color has turned <b>white</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> result of either a rare medical disorder or a bizarre curse.|$|E
5|$|With the {{conclusion}} of aerial operations around Khe Sanh and the close out of the Marine base, the focus of Igloo <b>White</b> (<b>as</b> <b>the</b> operation was redesignated in June) turned once again to Laos. On 15 November 1968, the Seventh/Thirteenth Air Force had inaugurated Operation Commando Hunt, a series of continuous interdiction operations against the Ho Chi Minh Trail that would continue {{until the end of}} American participation in the war. For the next four years Igloo White and Commando Hunt would be interlinked in the anti-infiltration effort.|$|E

5|$|With the {{transfer}} of political power, the Rhodesian Army, ZANLA and ZIPRA began to be merged to form the new Zimbabwe National Army. ZANLA and ZIPRA personnel were mixed into new battalions, guerrillas were picked out for officer training, and old Rhodesian units were variously disbanded or earmarked for reform. In some cases the latter meant only a change of symbolism and nomenclature; the Rhodesian Air Force, for example, remained almost all <b>white</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Air Force of Zimbabwe. Every one of the approximately 34,000 guerrillas was promised {{a place in the}} new army. In the meantime they would wait in respective ZANLA and ZIPRA assembly camps around the country with pay and rations identical to those of black privates in the old Rhodesian forces.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{the film}} was shown on Soviet {{television}} in a 101-minute version that Tarkovsky did not authorize. Notable scenes that were cut from this version were the raid of the Tartars and the scene showing naked pagans. The epilogue showing details of Andrei Rublev's icons was in black and <b>white</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union had not yet fully transitioned to color TV. In 1987, when Andrei Rublev was once again shown on Soviet TV, the epilogue was once again in black and white, despite the Soviet Union having completely transitioned to color TV. Another difference from the original version of {{the film was}} {{the inclusion of a}} short explanatory note {{at the beginning of the}} film, detailing the life of Andrei Rublev and the historical background. When the film was released in the U.S. and other countries in 1973, the distributor Columbia Pictures cut it by an additional 20 minutes, making the film an incoherent mess in the eyes of many critics and leading to unfavorable reviews.|$|E
5|$|The team's {{performance}} improved {{during the}} early 1970s, under manager Raymond Goethals. Fully dressed in <b>white,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> White Devils, Belgium had their first victories at World and European Championships at the 1970 World Cup and Euro 1972. En route to that Euro appearance, their first, they eliminated reigning European champions Italy by winning the two-legged play-offs on aggregate. At the end stage, they finished third by winning the consolation match against Hungary. In 1973, the denial of a match-winning goal in their last 1974 FIFA World Cup qualification game for UEFA Group 3 cost Belgium their appearance at the finals, causing Belgium to become the only nation ever to miss a World Cup final round despite not allowing a goal during the qualifiers. The next two attempts to reach a major finals were also fruitless.|$|E
50|$|Magnet schools {{emerged in}} the United States in <b>the</b> 1970s <b>as</b> one means of {{remedying}} racial segregation in public schools, and they were written into law in Section 5301 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Authorization. Demographic trends following the 1954 Brown v.

25|$|The {{original}} {{look of the}} Rapids {{sported a}} predominantly white kit with green trim, when the club's uniform supplier was Puma.

After five 5-minute rounds, Couture won a close unanimous decision. Some fans felt Rizzo had won, so the UFC set up an immediate rematch for UFC 34, in November 2001. This time, Couture won decisively by TKO in the third round.|$|E
25|$|Mallett {{moved back}} to France as coach for the Paris club Stade Fran√ßais, which he led to two {{consecutive}} French domestic title wins in 2003 and 2004 before returning to South Africa where he accepted the job of Director of Rugby at Western Province.

25|$|When Perth Glory {{was formed}} (in 1996), the club felt it {{important}} to create a logo and name with no ethnic overtones and which symbolised the rebirth of association football in Western Australia. It was felt the name Perth Glory had broad appeal {{and a sense of}} history. The sunburst in the logo is characteristic of Perth in summer, while purple was chosen as the main colour and orange and <b>white</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> secondary colours, they were chosen in contrast to the more traditional combinations (generally white, red or blue).|$|E

25|$|The colder {{part of a}} {{diffusion}} (incomplete combustion) flame will be red, transitioning to orange, yellow, and <b>white</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> temperature {{increases as}} evidenced by changes in the black-body radiation spectrum. For a given flame's region, the closer to white on this scale, the hotter that section of the flame is. The transitions are often apparent in fires, in which the color emitted closest to the fuel is white, with an orange section above it, and reddish flames the highest of all. A blue-colored flame only emerges when the amount of soot decreases and the blue emissions from excited molecular radicals become dominant, though the blue can often be seen near the base of candles where airborne soot is less concentrated.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th {{century the}} Scottish {{physicist}} James Clerk Maxwell {{found a new}} way of explaining colours, by the wavelength of their light. He showed that white light could be created by combining red, blue and green light, and that virtually all colours could be made by different combinations of these three colours. His idea, called additive colour or the RGB colour model, is used today to create colours on televisions and computer screens. The screen is covered by tiny pixels, each with three fluorescent elements for creating red, green and blue light. If the red, blue and green elements all glow at once, the pixel looks <b>white.</b> <b>As</b> <b>the</b> screen is scanned from behind with electrons, each pixel creates its own designated colour, composing a complete picture on the screen.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, the Packers' {{turnaround}} was complete. The team {{posted a}} league-best 13‚Äì3 {{record in the}} regular season, dominating the competition and securing home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. They were ranked no. 1 in offense with Brett Favre leading the way, no. 1 in defense with Reggie <b>White</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> leader of the defense and no. 1 in special teams with former Heisman Trophy winner Desmond Howard returning punts and kickoffs for touchdowns. After relatively easy wins against the 49ers in a muddy 35‚Äì14 beatdown and Carolina Panthers 30‚Äì13, the Packers advanced to the Super Bowl {{for the first time}} in 29 years. In Super Bowl XXXI, Green Bay defeated the New England Patriots 35‚Äì21 to win their 12th world championship. Desmond Howard was named MVP of the game for his kickoff return for a touchdown that ended the Patriots' bid for a comeback. Then-Packers President Bob Harlan credited Wolf, Holmgren, Favre, and White for ultimately changing the fortunes of the organization and turning the Green Bay Packers into a model NFL franchise. A 2007 panel of football experts at ESPN ranked the 1996 Packers the 6th-greatest team ever to play in the Super Bowl.|$|E
