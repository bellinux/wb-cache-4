50|$|Nathan Wegman (born 4 June 1977) in Launceston, Tasmania is an Australian cricket player, {{who plays}} for the Tasmanian Tigers. He plays his club cricket for New Town Cricket Club.He is a tall fast bowler with a <b>whipping</b> <b>action,</b> who {{produces}} deceptive pace. In his debut List A match for the Tigers, Wegman bowled beautifully to take 4/44 off 8.5 overs, including the prized wicket of NSW captain Simon Katich. Although a Launcestonian by birth, Nathan moved to Clarence {{to play in the}} more competitive TCA competition, a move which paid divedends when he was called up to the Tasmanian Tigers to help cover the bowling injury crisis of 2006.|$|R
50|$|Each finger {{should be}} {{touching}} the seam from the pads or tips to almost {{the ball of}} each finger. The thumb should rest underneath {{the ball in the}} middle of those two fingers, finding the apex of the horseshoe part of the seam. The thumb needs to rest on that seam from the side to the middle of its pad. If the middle finger is used, more <b>whipping</b> <b>action</b> occurs, making the pitch go around 10 mph faster. This ball tends to move for the pitcher a little bit depending on velocity, arm slot angle, and pressure points of the fingers. Retired pitchers Greg Maddux and Pedro Mart√≠nez were known for their effective two-seamers.|$|R
50|$|Whip retires to {{his late}} father's farm, {{surrounded}} by news vans. News of <b>Whip's</b> <b>actions</b> in the airplane revere {{him as a}} hero by notable media personalities, including Piers Morgan. At his father's farm, Whip throws out all of his alcohol and weed, determined to remain sober. He later meets Charlie and attorney Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle), Hugh explaining that the NTSB performed a toxicology test on Whip whilst he was unconscious - the results showing that Whip was not only intoxicated but also high during the flight, a finding that would definitely land Whip in prison if found that this contributed to the deaths onboard. Hugh promises to have the reported voided on technical grounds.|$|R

40|$|Retrofitment of {{commercial}} aircraft with propfans could introduce undesirable aerodynamic sources of structure-borne noise that are absent for current turbojet powerplants. This paper theoretically examines the <b>whipping</b> <b>action</b> of the vortex wake from a generic propeller on the downstream rigid wing that supports it. The model addresses the high-frequency/compressible regime of most anticipated propfan implementations and produces an analytic {{solution for the}} distributed wing airload due to the periodic vortex impingement. The analysis also yields an expression for the local unsteady lift obtained from integration over an arbitrary internal patch of wing surface, {{for the purpose of}} applying a practical number of such forces at the nodes of a finite-element model for the corresponding structure (wing response results are not included in the present paper). Reported estimates of induced wing loads for a conventional-propeller example of demonstration appear to be in the reasonable range of expectation...|$|R
40|$|Reported {{calculations}} of structure-borne cabin noise {{for a small}} twin engine aircraft powered by tractor propellers rely on the following three-stage methodological breakup of the problem: (1) the unsteady-aerodynamic prediction of wing lift harmonics caused by the <b>whipping</b> <b>action</b> of the vortex system trailed from each propeller; (2) the associated wing/fuselage structural response; (3) the cabin noise field for the computed wall vibration. The first part [...] the estimate of airloads [...] skirts a full-fledged aeroelastic situation by assuming the wing to be fixed in space while cancelling the downwash field of the cutting vortices. The model {{is based on an}} approximate high-frequency lifting-surface theory justified by the blade rate and flight Mach number of application. Its results drive a finite-element representation of the wing accounting for upper and lower skin surfaces, spars, ribs, and the presence of fuel. The fuselage, modeled as a frame-stiffened cylindrical shell, is bolted to the wing...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyse the {{kinematic}} sequencing in the penalty-corner drag-flicks of elite male and female field hockey players of international calibre. Thirteen participants (one skilled male drag-flicker and six male and six female elite players) participated in the study. An optoelectronic motion analysis system was used to capture the drag-flicks with six cameras, sampling at 250 Hz. Select ground reaction force parameters were obtained from a force platform which registered the last support of the front foot. Twenty trials were captured from each subject. Both player groups showed significantly (p < 0. 05) smaller ball velocity at release, peak angular velocity of the pelvis, and negative and positive peak angular velocities of the stick than the skilled subject. Normalised ground reaction forces of the gender groups were also smaller than that of the skilled drag-flicker. By comparing these players we established that the cues of the skill level are a wide stance, a <b>whipping</b> <b>action</b> (rapid back lift) of the stick followed by an explosive sequential movement of the pelvis, upper trunk and stick...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{advanced}} diabolo {{style is}} vertax (vertical axis; {{also known as}} [...] "Excalibur"). This is where the diabolo is [...] "turned vertically" [...] by means of [...] "whipping" [...] and is continually spun in this upright state. The person spinning it needs to rotate their body {{to keep up with}} the constant <b>whipping</b> <b>action</b> due to the momentum and centripetal motion at which the diabolo spins. Although the number of tricks seems limited, people are finding more ways to perform with this style, including vertax genocides, infinite suicides, and many suns, orbits, and satellites. It is also possible to have two diabolos in one string in vertax, this feat has been achieved by diabolo duo Tr'espace and a small number of other diaboloists. It has also been done in the form of a fan. Most of these tricks are accomplished by street performers in competitions, notably the GEDC and the Taipei PEC. Some cutting-edge skilled vertax jugglers include William (Wei-Liang) Lin (in 2006, ranked #1 in the world), Ryo Yabe (multiple diabolos), Higami (a Japanese juggling group, noted for inventing the first 'infinite suicide vertax'), and Jonathan P. Chen (noted for inventing the vertax genocide); these jugglers are former and multiple winners of the above-mentioned cups. Eric and Antonin (France) and Nate and Jacob Sharpe (USA) have contributed greatly to the development of vertax passing techniques. Finally, Alexis Levillon invented many vertax tricks including vertax integrals, furthered multidiabolo vertax, and has also invented the [...] "Galexis" [...] style, where one diabolo is horizontal, while the other is in vertax.|$|R

40|$|One hundred nine runners {{were treated}} {{conservatively}} without immobilization for overuse {{injury to the}} Achilles tendon. Treatment strategies were directed toward re-habilitation of the gastrocnemius/soleus muscle-tendon unit, control of inflammation and pain, and control of biomechanical parameters. One fair, 12 good, and 73 excellent results were reported, with a mean recovery time of 5 week. Followup was incomplete in 23 cases. The three most prevalent etiological factors were overtraining (82 cases), functional overpronation (61 cases), and gastrocnemius/soleus insufficiency (41 cases). The authors speculate that runners are susceptible to Achilles tendinitis with peritendinitis due to micro-trauma produced by the eccentric loading of fatigued muscle, excess pronation producing <b>whipping</b> <b>action</b> of the Achilles tendon, and/or vascular blanching of the Achilles tendon produced by conflicting internal and external rotatory forces imparted to the tibia by simul-taneous pronation and knee extension. Virtually all cases of Achilles tendon injury appear to result from structural or dynamic disturbances in normal lower leg mechanics and require active treatment regimens which attempt to establish normal function to prevent recur-rence. Achilles tendon disorders are a nemesis to both the athlete and the physician. Different treatment strategies may be required for seemingly identical symptoms in two individu-als. One may respond {{within a matter of}} days while another may require a prolonged convalescence to fully alleviate symptoms. Poor gastrocnemius/soleus flexibility and faulty footwear are two commonly accepted etiological factors in Achilles tendinitis with peritendinitis, yet often neither one of these factors can be implicated. This observation has prompted us to investigate other mechanisms. The purposes of this paper are to present the results of conservative treatment of 109 runners with overuse injury to the Achilles tendon and to discuss the implications of functional overpronation as an etiological factor in this condition...|$|R

2500|$|The Australian {{aboriginal}} fast bowler Eddie Gilbert {{was another}} fast bowler who generated extreme pace from a remarkably short run. Just 5 feet 7inches tall and nine stone in weight he took wickets at a prodigious {{rate in the}} late 1920s in Queensland club cricket. [...] He was chosen for Queensland against New South Wales Colts in 1930 and took 6 wickets but the Brisbane Courier's correspondent [...] "Long On" [...] was moved to describe his <b>whipped</b> catapult <b>action</b> as [...] "almost a throw". He was picked for Queensland's Sheffield Shield side and bowled with great success. [...] Queensland selectors responded to complaints from New South Wales by filming his arm action in slow motion but took no action against him. His most famous spell came against Don Bradman on 6 November 1931. He dismissed the NSW opener with his first ball, a vicious bouncer, then knocked Bradman's bat {{out of his hands}} with the next. The next delivery knocked Bradman over and the third had him caught behind. A month later, playing against Victoria, he was repeatedly called for throwing. He played on for Queensland, bowling at a reduced pace, and in 1934‚Äì35 headed the Queensland averages. He was a victim of legislation outlawing intimidatory bowling, {{in the wake of the}} Bodyline affair and retired in 1936, having taken 87 first-class wickets at 29.21. He later suffered from mental illness.|$|R

[...] Steve Rose of The Guardian rated the film three stars out of five; he said, [...] "Non-devotees might struggle, but director Bryan Singer <b>whips</b> up the <b>action</b> towards a symphonic climax". David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "While it's more dramatically diffuse than the reboot and lacks a definitive villain, the new film is shot through with a stirring reverence for the Marvel Comics characters and their universe". Justin Chang of Variety said, [...] "If the characters' quandaries at times feel overly circumscribed, they're also advanced with a bracing emotional directness, devoid of either cynicism or sentimentalism, that touches genuine chords of feeling {{over the course of the}} film‚Äôs fleet 130-minute [...] running time".
