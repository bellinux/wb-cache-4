5|$|Thomas died at York on 18 November 1100. He was {{considered}} {{to have been an}} excellent archbishop, and ensured his cathedral clergy was <b>well</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for.</b> He repaired the cathedral and did much to promote trade in the city of York. Thomas also helped to advance the careers of his family; one of his nephews, ThomasII of York, became Archbishop of York in 1108, and another, Richard, became Bishop of Bayeux in 1107.|$|E
5|$|The Mortaras {{spent the}} morning of 24 June {{attempting}} to have Feletti's order overruled by either the city's cardinal legate, Giuseppe Milesi Pironi Ferretti, or the Archbishop of Bologna, Michele Viale-Prelà, but they found that neither was in the city. Around noon, the Mortaras decided {{to take steps to}} make the separation as painless as possible. Edgardo's siblings were taken to visit relatives while Marianna reluctantly agreed to spend the evening with the wife of Giuseppe Vitta, a Jewish family friend. Around 17:00 Momolo visited San Domenico to make one last plea to Feletti. The inquisitor repeated all he had said to Padovani and Moscato the previous night and told Momolo not to worry as Edgardo would be <b>well</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for,</b> under the protection of the Pope himself. He warned that it would benefit no-one to make a scene when the carabinieri returned that evening.|$|E
5|$|Those {{opposed to}} the new {{government}} began to make plans to free Edward, and Roger Mortimer decided to move Edward to the more secure location of Berkeley Castle in Gloucestershire, where the former King arrived around 5 April 1327. Once at the castle, Edward was kept {{in the custody of}} Mortimer's son-in-law, Thomas Berkeley, and John Maltravers, who were given £5 a day for Edward's maintenance. It is unclear how <b>well</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> Edward was; the records show luxury goods being bought on his behalf, but some chroniclers suggest that he was often mistreated. A poem, the Lament of Edward II, was once thought to have been written by Edward during his imprisonment, although modern scholarship has cast doubt on this.|$|E

25|$|The tomb was {{subsequently}} neglected again (but not lost) until {{purchased by the}} city of Rome; in fact, there were reports of a gypsy family living in it. The tomb was restored in 1926 by the X Ripartizione of the Comune di Roma. At that time, masonry installed in 1616 and 1780 was removed. At the present time it contains duplicates of the material in the Vatican and is <b>well</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for.</b> Steel pins or beams support sections in danger of collapsing.|$|E
25|$|Miss Eirlys Edwards, a {{clerk in}} Newport Education Department (with no {{training}} or experience in matters of child welfare), testified {{on the second day}} that she visited Bank Farm on 20 December 1944, and observed that the boys were treated with little affection, and while Terence appeared to be <b>well</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for,</b> Dennis appeared ill and frightened; she asked Mrs Gough to call a doctor to examine him, which she said she would do. She had recommended to her superiors that the boys be removed and Mr W. J. Edmonds, Newport's Deputy Director of Education, confirmed that he had requested Shropshire Education Committee to do so, although the Goughs had not yet been informed of this decision.|$|E

25|$|The Byzantine-Ottoman {{wars and}} the Ottoman wars in Europe brought {{large numbers of}} slaves into the Islamic world. To staff its bureaucracy, the Ottoman Empire {{established}} a janissary system which seized {{hundreds of thousands of}} Christian boys through the devşirme system. They were <b>well</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> but were legally slaves owned by the government and were not allowed to marry. They were never bought or sold. The Empire gave them significant administrative and military roles. The system began about 1365; there were 135,000 janissaries in 1826, when the system ended. After the Battle of Lepanto, 12,000 Christian galley slaves were recaptured and freed from the Ottoman fleet. Eastern Europe suffered a series of Tatar invasions, the goal of which was to loot and capture slaves into jasyr. Seventy-five Crimean Tatar raids were recorded into Poland–Lithuania between 1474 and 1569.|$|E
25|$|In 489, however, Emperor Zeno {{decided to}} oust the Ostrogoths, a foederatum {{people living in the}} Danube, by sending them into Italy. On February 25, 493 Theodoric the Great {{defeated}} Odoacer and became the king of the Ostrogoths. Theodoric, who had lived long in Constantinople, is now generally considered a Romanized German, and he in fact ruled over Italy largely through Roman personnel. The Goth minority, of Arian confession, constituted an aristocracy of landowners and militaries, but its influence over the country remained minimal; the Latin population was still subject to Roman laws, and maintained the freedom of creed received by Odoacer. The reign of Theodoric is generally considered a period of recovery for the country. Infrastructures were repaired, frontiers were expanded, and the economy <b>well</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for.</b> The Latin culture flourished for the last time with figures like Boethius, Theodoric's minister; the Italian Kingdom was again the most powerful political entity of the Mediterranean. However, Theodoric's successors were not equal to him.|$|E
25|$|Alerted to {{imminent}} danger, the British commander instantly {{ordered a}} retreat {{across the bridge}} at Arzobispo. For his part, Cuesta immediately led his army in retreat from Talavera to Oropesa, abandoning the British hospitals. With only about 40 wagons and carts available, 1,500 badly wounded men were left behind. The remainder were told {{to make their way}} as best they could. Eventually, 2,000 hobbled into the British lines. Another 500 either died en route or were captured by the French. The ones who were made prisoner by the French were <b>well</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for.</b> Cuesta could have crossed the Tagus at Talavera and retreated on the south bank. However, the roads on that side pass through the Sierra de Guadalupe and were so bad that the Spanish army would have had to abandon its artillery and wagon train. Instead, Cuesta took the risk of marching on the north bank, where the French were known to be at large.|$|E

25|$|Supporters of {{the event}} argue that the horses are <b>well</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for,</b> {{before and after the}} race itself. At the Calgary Stampede, {{officials}} work closely with local Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Calgary Humane Society staff to ensure that the horses are fit enough to endure the race. Wagon drivers express sadness over the periodic deaths of horses at the Stampede, explaining that, while unfortunate, animal injury and death are a normal element of any ranch or farming operation. Critics counter that chuckwagon racing is simply an adrenailine sport and produces no food. Thus the practice is an unnecessary and cruel risk to force horses to take. It is unclear how broad public support for the sport actually is, although it has been a marquee event for the Calgary Stampede for many decades, perhaps {{in part because of the}} possibility of disaster and the drama it adds to the Stampede as entertainment.|$|E
25|$|After {{the ambush}} of the 507th Maintenance Company during the Battle of Nasiriyah on 23 March, {{the bodies of}} several U.S. {{soldiers}} {{who had been killed}} in the ambush were shown on Iraqi television. Some of these soldiers had visible gunshot wounds to head, leading to speculation that they had been executed. Except for Sgt. Donald Walters, no evidence has since surfaced to support this scenario and it is generally accepted that the soldiers were killed in action. Five live prisoners of war were also interviewed on the air, a violation of the Third Geneva Convention. Sergeant Walters was initially reported to {{have been killed in the}} ambush after killing several Fedayeen before running out of ammunition. However, an eyewitness later reported that he had seen Walters being guarded by several Fedayeen in front of a building. Forensics work later found Walters' blood in front of the building and blood spatter suggesting he died from two gunshot wounds to the back at close range. This led the Army to conclude that Walters had been executed after being captured, and he was posthumously awarded the Prisoner of War Medal in 2004. It was alleged in the authorized biography of Pfc. Jessica Lynch that she was raped by her captors after her capture, based on medical reports and the pattern of her injuries, though this is not supported by Ms Lynch. Mohammed Odeh al-Rehaief, who later helped American forces rescue Lynch, stated that he saw an Iraqi Colonel slap Lynch while she was in her hospital bed. The staff at the hospital where Lynch was held later denied both stories, saying that Lynch was <b>well</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for.</b> While Lynch suffers from amnesia due to her injuries, Lynch herself has denied any mistreatment whilst in captivity.|$|E
500|$|Chuckwagon {{racing is}} a {{particular}} source of controversy. [...] Animal rights groups protest the event, arguing that the sport causes undue suffering for the horses.

500|$|Reckless was <b>well</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> {{and treated}} as a VIP during her time at Camp Pendleton. The Marine Corps was also careful not {{to allow her to}} be {{exploited}} by commercial interests. She produced four foals there: colts Fearless (1957), Dauntless (1959), and Chesty (1964); her last foal, a filly born circa 1965–1966, died a month after birth and was unnamed. Her offspring Chesty was named after Chesty Puller, one of the few Marines ever allowed to ride Reckless. Puller was a Marine Corps lieutenant general and the most decorated United States Marine of all time. Reckless retired from active service with full military honors at Camp Pendleton on November 10, 1960. She was provided free quarters and feed in lieu of retirement pay, per Marine Corps documents.|$|E
500|$|Permits are {{required}} to keep bald eagles in captivity in the United States. Permits are primarily issued to public educational institutions, and the eagles which they show are permanently injured individuals which cannot be released to the wild. The facilities where eagles are kept must be equipped with adequate caging and facilities, as well as workers experienced in the handling and care of eagles. Bald eagles cannot legally be kept for falconry in the United States. As a rule, the bald eagle is a poor choice for public shows, being timid, prone to becoming highly stressed, and unpredictable in nature. Native American tribes can obtain a [...] "Native American Religious Use" [...] permit to keep non-releasable eagles as well. They use their naturally molted feathers for religious and cultural ceremonies. The bald eagle can be long-lived in captivity if <b>well</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for,</b> but does not breed well even under the best conditions. In Canada, a license is required to keep bald eagles for falconry.|$|E

500|$|Cotton was {{to appear}} before William Laud, the Bishop of London, who was on a {{campaign}} to suppress Puritan practices. He now felt that his best option was to disappear into the Puritan underground, and then decide his course of action from there. [...] In October 1632, he wrote his wife a letter from hiding, {{saying that he was}} being <b>well</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> but that she would be followed if she attempted to join him. [...] Two very prominent Puritans came to visit him in hiding: Thomas Goodwin and John Davenport. [...] Both men came to convince him that it would be acceptable for him to conform to the established church rather than deal with possible imprisonment. [...] Instead, Cotton compelled these two men into further nonconformity, and Goodwin went on to be the voice of the independents (Congregationalists) at the Westminster Assembly in 1643, while Davenport became the founder of the Puritan New Haven Colony in North America, using Cotton's theocratic model of government. [...] It was Cotton's influence on men of such prominence that made him [...] "the most important of the Congregational leaders," [...] and later a prime target for attacks by the Presbyterians.|$|E
500|$|Instead {{of serving}} at sea, he {{spent time in}} the House of Lords, where he spoke in {{opposition}} to the abolition of slavery, which although not legal in the United Kingdom still existed in the British colonies. Freedom would do the slaves little good, he argued. He had travelled widely and, in his eyes, the living standard among freemen in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland was worse than that among slaves in the West Indies. His experience in the Caribbean, where he [...] "quickly absorbed the plantation owners' views about slavery", lent weight to his position, which was perceived as well-argued and just by some of his contemporaries. In his first speech before Parliament he called himself [...] "an attentive observer {{of the state of the}} negroes" [...] who found them <b>well</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> and [...] "in a state of humble happiness". Others thought it [...] "shocking that so young a man, under no bias of interest, should be earnest in continuance of the slave trade". In his speech to the House of Lords, William insulted William Wilberforce, the leading abolitionist, saying: [...] "the proponents of the abolition are either fanatics or hypocrites, and in one of those classes I rank Mr. Wilberforce".|$|E
500|$|The town's {{fields were}} {{enclosed}} in 1796 and {{a map of}} the village was drawn up at the same time, showing the settlement along Town Road and Townside Road with Rector Field and Earl Field to the north and north-east respectively. At the time, more than 210 acres of land were allotted to the rectory by Lord Bristol in place of the tithes it had previously been entitled to. During the mid and late-19th century, the population of the old village of Quarrington declined (from 98 in 1851 to 72 in 1871). Aside from the rectory and church, the village included two large farms and a cluster of labourers cottages around Town Road. By 1872, the parish spanned 1,620 acres and the village contained 63 houses. The same year, Trollope wrote that [...] "the appearance of this small village, lying around its <b>well</b> <b>cared</b> <b>for</b> church, is very pleasing". As Sleaford expanded, houses were built along London and Station Roads, pushing the town inside the Quarrington parish boundaries in what became New Quarrington. Sanitation in the poorest parts of Sleaford worsened during the 19th century and a Local Board of Health was charged with improving living conditions. In 1879, Lord Bristol sold land on Quarrington Hill to the board, who built a pumping station to transport clean fenland water east into the town.|$|E
