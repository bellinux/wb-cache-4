The {{results show that}} both the length between two adjacent connectors and the radial clearance difference between the tubular string body and connector affect the critical buckling loads a lot. With {{a decrease in the}} length between two adjacent connectors, the effective radial clearance approaches the connector radial clearance. When the length between two adjacent connectors reaches the critical value where the tubular string is just in point contact with the wellbore, the critical buckling load achieves its minimum value.

Later, Paslay and Cernocky (1991) extended Lubinski’s work to the axial compression case. The results show that the local bending curvature with connectors is larger than the wellbore curvature. Therefore, the bending moment magnification should be taken into consideration for the tubular string design. On the basis of Paslay’s work, Huang et al. (2015 c) further considered the effect of tubular string weight and assumed that the wellbore curvature is equivalent to an additional tubular string weight. The results show that the tubular string weight and wellbore curvature affect the critical transition conditions between different contact cases a lot. All these studies focus only on the two-dimensional lateral deflection situations.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to develop mathematical simulation models for predicting the transient behaviour of strings and beams subjected to impacts. The developed models are applied to study {{the dynamics of the}} piano and the sitar. For simulating rigid point impacts on continuous systems, a new method is proposed based on the unit impulse response. The developed method allows one to relate modal velocities before and after impact, without requiring the integration of the system equations of motion during impact. The proposed method has been used to model the impact of a pinned-pinned beam with a rigid obstacle. Numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the inability of the collocation-based coefficient of restitution method to predict an accurate and energy-consistent response. The results using the unit-impulse-based coefficient of restitution method are also compared to those obtained with a penalty approach,with good agreement. A new moving boundary formulation is presented to simulate <b>wrapping</b> <b>contacts</b> in continuous systems impacting rigid distributed obstacles. The free vibration response of an ideal string impacting a distributed parabolic obstacle located at its boundary is analyzed to understand and simulate a sitar string. The portion of the string in contact with the obstacle is governed by a different partial differential equation (PDE) from the free portion represented by the classical string equation. These two PDEs and corresponding boundary conditions, along with the transversality condition that governs the dynamics of the moving boundary, are obtained using Hamilton's principle. A Galerkin approximation is used to convert them into a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, with time-dependent mode-shapes as basis functions. The advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method are discussed in comparison to the penalty approach for simulating <b>wrapping</b> <b>contacts.</b> Finally, the model is used to investigate the mechanism behind the generation of the buzzing tone in a sitar. An alternate formulation using the penalty approach is also proposed, and the results are contrasted with those obtained using the moving boundary approach. A model for studying the interaction between a flexible beam and a string at a point including friction has also been developed. This model is used to study the interaction between a piano hammer and the string. A realistic model of the piano hammer-string interaction must treat both the action mechanism and the string. An elastic stiff string model is integrated with a dynamic model of a compliant piano action mechanism with a flexible hammer shank. Simulations have been used to compare the mechanism response for impact on an elastic string and a rigid stop. Hammer head scuffing along the string, as well as length of time in contact, were found to increase where an elastic string was used, while hammer shank vibration amplitude and peak contact force decreased. Introducing hammer-string friction decreases the duration of contact and reduces the extent of scuffing. Finally, significant differences in hammer and string motion were predicted for a highly flexible hammer shank. Initial contact time and location, length of contact period, peak contact force, hammer vibration amplitude, scuffing extent, and string spectral content were all influenced...|$|R

The commercially available solar cells are relatively inexpensive and have a high payoff potential. Commercially available thin film solar cells are primarily being produced for terrestrial applications.

40|$|Dual {{junction}} {{amorphous silicon}} (a-Si) solar cells produced on polyimide substrate {{have been selected}} as the best candidate to produce a lightweight solar array for the PowerSphere program. The PowerSphere concept features a space-inflatable, geodetic solar array approximately 0. 6 meters in diameter and capable of generating about 20 W of electrical power. Trade studies of various wiring concepts and connection methods led to an interconnect design with a copper <b>contact</b> that <b>wraps</b> around the edge, {{to the back of}} the solar cell. Applying Plasma Vapor Deposited (PVD) copper film to both sides and the edge of the solar cell produces the <b>wrap</b> around <b>contact.</b> This procedure results in a contact pad on the back of the solar cell, which is then laser welded to a flex circuit material. The flex circuit is constructed of copper in a custom designed routing pattern, and then sandwiched in a Kapton insulation layer. The flex circuit then serves as the primary power distribution system between the solar cells and the spacecraft. Flex circuit material is the best candidate for the wiring harness because it allows for low force deployment of the solar cells by the inflatable hinges on the PowerSphere. An additional frame structure, fabricated and assembled by ILC Dover, will reinforce the wrap around contact-flex blanket connection, thus providing a mechanically robust solar cell interconnect for the PowerSphere multifunctional program.

However, yarn evenness and tensile properties deteriorated for ramie/cotton yarn spun with a delivery rubber roller.

40|$|Astrocyte end-feet {{surround}} intraparenchymal microvessels {{and represent}} therefore the first cellular barrier for glucose entering the brain. As such, {{they are a}} likely site of prevalent glucose uptake. Astrocytic processes are also <b>wrapped</b> around synaptic <b>contacts,</b> implying that they are ideally positioned to sense and be functionally coupled to increased synaptic activity. We have recently demonstrated that glutamate, the main excitatory neurotransmitter, stimulates in a concentration-dependent manner 2 -DG uptake and phosphorylation by astrocytes in primary culture. The effect is not receptor-mediated but rather proceeds via one of the recently cloned glutamate transporter. The mechanism involves an activation of the Na+/K+ ATPase. Concomitant to the stimulation of glucose uptake, glutamate causes a concentration-dependent increase in lactate efflux. These observations suggest that glutamate uptake is coupled to aerobic glycolysis in astrocytes. In addition, since glutamate release occurs following the modality-specific activation of a brain region, the glutamate-evoked uptake of glucose into astrocytes provides a simple mechanism to couple neuronal activity to energy metabolism. These data also suggest that modality-specific activation visualized using 2 DG-based autoradiography or PET may primarily reflect glutamate-mediated uptake of 2 DG into astrocytes...|$|R

40|$|A {{flat head}} and a tape {{transport}} arrangement impart a wrap angle to the tape at the upstream corner of the head. The wrap angle, corner sharpness and tape stiffness are sufficient to cause a moving tape to form a hollow bump at the upstream corner, thereby creating a hollow into which entrained air can expand, causing a subambient pressure within and downstream of the bump. This pressure keeps the tape {{in contact with the}} head. It is created without the need for a groove or complex pressure relief slot(s). No contact pressure arises at the signal exchange site due to media <b>wrap.</b> The highest <b>contact</b> pressures are developed at a wrapped upstream corner. For a tape drive, traveling in both forward and reverse, the wrap can be at both the upstream and downstream (which is the reverse upstream) corners. Heads that are not flat can also be used, if the wrap angle relative to a main surface is sufficient and not too large. The wrapped head can also be used with rotating media, such as disks (floppy and hard) and rotating heads, such as helical wound heads for video recording. Multiple flat tape bearing surfaces can be separated by grooves and/or angles. Each flat can carry heads along one or more gap lines.

When this effect is used to create three dimensional shapes from initially flat sheets, the effect is called capillary origami or droplet wrapping. In this work, we consider how the conditions for the spontaneous, capillary induced, folding of a thin ribbon substrate might be altered by a rigid surface structure that, for a rigid substrate, would be expected to create Cassie&# 8211;Baxter and Wenzel effects. For smooth thin substrates, droplet wrapping can occur for all liquids, including those for which the Young&# 8217;s law contact angle (defined by the interfacial tensions) is greater than 90 &# 176; and which would therefore normally be considered relatively hydrophobic. However, consideration of the balance between bending and interfacial energies suggests that the tendency for droplet wrapping can be suppressed for some liquids by providing the flexible solid surface with a rigid topographic structure. In general, it is known that when a liquid interacts with such a structure it can either fully penetrate the structure (the Wenzel case) or it can bridge between the asperities of the structure (the Cassie&# 8211;Baxter case). In this report, we show theoretically that droplet wrapping should occur with both types of solid&# 8211;liquid contact. We also derive a condition for the transition between the Cassie&# 8211;Baxter and Wenzel type droplet wrapping and relate it to the same transition condition known to apply to superhydrophobic surfaces.

40|$|Background: While {{survival}} rates for preterm infants have increased, {{the risk for}} adverse long-term neurodevelopmental and behavioral outcomes remains very high. In response {{to the need for}} novel, evidence-based interventions that prevent such outcomes, we have assessed Family Nurture Intervention (FNI), a novel dual mother-infant intervention implemented while the infant is in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). Here, we report the first trial results, including the primary outcome measure, length of stay in the NICU and, the feasibility and safety of its implementation in a high acuity level IV NICU. Methods: The FNI trial is a single center, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial at Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital for mothers and their singleton or twin infants of 26 – 34 weeks gestation. Families were randomized to standard care (SC) or (FNI). FNI was implemented by nurture specialists trained to facilitate affective communication between mother and infant during specified calming interactions. These interactions included scent cloth exchange, sustained touch, vocal soothing and eye <b>contact,</b> <b>wrapped</b> or skin-to-skin holding, plus family-based support interactions. Results: A total of 826 infants born between 26 and 34 weeks during the 3. 5 year study period were admitted to the NICU. After infant and mother screening plus exclusion due to circumstances that prevented the family from participating, 373 infants were eligible for the study. Of these, we were unable to schedule a consent meeting with 56, and consent was withheld by 165. Consent was obtained for 150 infants from 115 families. The infants were block randomized to groups of N[*]=[*] 78, FNI and N[*]=[*] 72, SC. Sixteen (9. 6 %) of the randomized infants did not complete the study to home discharge, 7 % of those randomized to SC and 12 % of FNI infants. Mothers in the intervention group engaged in 3 to 4 facilitated one- to two-hour sessions/week. Intent to treat analyses revealed no significant difference between groups in medical complications. The mean length of stay was not significantly affected by the intervention. Conclusion: There was no significant effect demonstrated with this intervention amount on the primary short-term outcome, length of stay. FNI can be safely and feasibly implemented within a level IV NICU...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{striking}} {{advances in}} functional brain imaging, the cellular and molecular mechanisms {{that underlie the}} signals detected by these techniques are still largely unknown. The basic physiological principle of functional imaging {{is represented by the}} tight coupling existing between neuronal activity and the associated local increase in both blood flow and energy metabolism. Positron emission tomography (PET) signals detect blood flow, oxygen consumption and glucose use associated with neuronal activity; the degree of blood oxygenation is currently thought to contribute to the signal detected with functional magnetic resonance imaging, while magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) identifies the spatio-temporal pattern of the activity-dependent appearance of certain metabolic intermediates such as glucose or lactate. Recent studies, including those of neurotransmitter-regulated metabolic fluxes in purified preparations and analyses of the cellular localization of enzymes and transporters involved in energy metabolism, as well as in vivo microdialysis and MRS approaches have identified the neurotransmitter glutamate and astrocytes, a specific type of glial cell, as pivotal elements in the coupling of synaptic activity with energy metabolism. Astrocytes are ideally positioned to sense increases in synaptic activity and to couple them with energy metabolism. Indeed they possess specialized processes that cover the surface of intraparenchymal capillaries, suggesting that astrocytes may be a likely site of prevalent glucose uptake. Other astrocyte processes are <b>wrapped</b> around synaptic <b>contacts</b> which possess receptors and reuptake sites for neurotransmitters. Glutamate stimulates glucose uptake into astrocytes. This effect is mediated by specific glutamate transporters present on these cells. The activity of these transporters, which is tightly coupled to the synaptic release of glutamate and operates the clearance of glutamate from the extracellular space, is driven by the electrochemical gradient of Na+. This Na(+) -dependent uptake of glutamate into astrocytes triggers a cascade of molecular events involving the Na+/K(+) -ATPase leading to the glycolytic processing of glucose and the release of lactate by astrocytes. The stoichiometry of this process is such that for one glutamate molecule taken up with three Na+ ions, one glucose molecule enters an astrocyte, two ATP molecules are produced through aerobic glycolysis and two lactate molecules are released. Within the astrocyte, one ATP molecule fuels one 'turn of the pump' while the other provides the energy needed to convert glutamate to glutamine by glutamine synthase. Evidence has been accumulated from structural as well as functional studies indicating that, under aerobic conditions, lactate may be the preferred energy substrate of activated neurons. Indeed, in the presence of oxygen, lactate is converted to pyruvate, which can be processed through the tricarboxylic acid cycle and the associated oxidative phosphorylation, to yield 17 ATP molecules per lactate molecule. These data suggest that during activation the brain may transiently resort to aerobic glycolysis occurring in astrocytes, followed by the oxidation of lactate by neurons. The proposed model provides a direct mechanism to couple synaptic activity with glucose use and is consistent with the notion that the signals detected during physiological activation with 18 F-deoxyglucose (DG) -PET may reflect predominantly uptake of the tracer into astrocytes. This conclusion does not question the validity of the 2 -DG-based techniques, rather it provides a cellular and molecular basis for these functional brain imaging techniques...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Docter of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The objective of the work carried out in this thesis was to develop analytical and computational tools to model and investigate musculoskeletal human joints. It was recognised that the FEA was used by many researchers in modelling human musculoskeletal motion, loading and stresses. However the continuum mechanics played only a minor {{role in determining the}} articular joint motion, and its value was questionable. This is firstly due to the computational cost and secondly due to its impracticality for this application. On the other hand, there isn’t any suitable software for precise articular joint motion analysis to deal with the local joint stresses or non standard joints. The main requirement in orthopaedics field is to develop a modeller software (and its associated theories) to model anatomic joint as it is, without any simplification with respect to joint surface morphology and material properties of surrounding tissues. So that the proposed modeller can be used for evaluating and diagnosing different joint abnormalities but furthermore form the basis for performing implant insertion and analysis of the artificial joints. The work which is presented in this thesis is a new frame work and has been developed for human anatomic joint analysis which describes the joint in terms of its surface geometry and surrounding musculoskeletal tissues. In achieving such a framework several contributions were made to the 6 DOF linear and nonlinear joint modelling, the mathematical definition of joint stiffness, tissue path finding and <b>wrapping</b> and the <b>contact</b> with collision analysis. In 6 DOF linear joint modelling, the contribution is the development of joint stiffness and damping matrices. This modelling approach is suitable for the linear range of tissue stiffness and damping properties. This is {{the first of its kind}} and it gives a firm analytical basis for investigating joints with surrounding tissue and the cartilage. The 6 DOF nonlinear joint modelling is a new scheme which is described for modelling the motion of multi bodies joined by non-linear stiffness and contact elements. The proposed method requires no matrix assembly for the stiffness and damping elements or mass elements. The novelty in the nonlinear modelling, relates to the overall algorithmic approach and handling local non-linearity by procedural means. The mathematical definition of joint stiffness is also a new proposal which is based on the mathematical definition of stiffness between two bodies. Based on the joint stiffness matrix properties, number of joint stiffness invariants was obtained analytically such as the centre of stiffness, the principal translational stiffnesses, and the principal rotational stiffnesses. In corresponding to these principal stiffnesses, their principal axes have been also obtained. Altogether, a joint is assessed by six principal axes and six principal stiffnesses and its centre of stiffness. These formulations are new and show that a joint can be described in terms of inherent stiffness properties. It is expected that these will be better in characterising a joint in comparison to laxity based characterisation. The development of tissue path finding and wrapping algorithms are also introduced as new approaches. The musculoskeletal tissue wrapping involves calculating the shortest distance between two points on a meshed surface. A new heuristic algorithm was proposed. The heuristic is based on minimising the accumulative divergence from the straight line between two points on the surface and the direction of travel on the surface (i. e. bone). In contact and collision based development, the novel algorithm has been proposed that detects possible colliding points on the motion trajectory by redefining the distance as a two dimensional measure along the velocity approach vector and perpendicular to this vector. The perpendicular distance determines if there are potentially colliding points, and the distance along the velocity determines how close they are. The closest pair among the potentially colliding points gives the “time to collision”. The algorithm can eliminate the “fly pass” situation where very close points may not collide because of the direction of their relative velocity. All these developed algorithms and modelling theories, have been encompassed in the developed prototype software in order to simulate the anatomic joint articulations through modelling formulations developed. The software platform provides a capability for analysing joints as 6 DOF joints based on anatomic joint surfaces. The software is highly interactive and driven by well structured database, designed to be highly flexible for the future developments. Particularly, two case studies are carried out in this thesis in order to generate results relating to all the proposed elements of the study. The results obtained from the case studies show good agreement with previously published results or model based results obtained from Lifemod software, whenever comparison was possible. In some cases the comparison was not possible because there were no equivalent results; the results were supported by other indicators. The modelling based results were also supported by experiments performed in the Brunel Orthopaedic Research and Learning Centre...|$|R

The work which is presented in this thesis is a new frame work and has been developed for human anatomic joint analysis which describes the joint in terms of its surface geometry and surrounding musculoskeletal tissues. In achieving such a framework several contributions were made to the 6 DOF linear and nonlinear joint modelling, the mathematical definition of joint stiffness, tissue path finding and <b>wrapping</b> and the <b>contact</b> with collision analysis. In 6 DOF linear joint modelling, the contribution is the development of joint stiffness and damping matrices. This modelling approach is suitable for the linear range of tissue stiffness and damping properties. This is {{the first of its kind}} and it gives a firm analytical basis for investigating joints with surrounding tissue and the cartilage. The 6 DOF nonlinear joint modelling is a new scheme which is described for modelling the motion of multi bodies joined by non-linear stiffness and contact elements. The proposed method requires no matrix assembly for the stiffness and damping elements or mass elements. The novelty in the nonlinear modelling, relates to the overall algorithmic approach and handling local non-linearity by procedural means. The mathematical definition of joint stiffness is also a new proposal which is based on the mathematical definition of stiffness between two bodies. Based on the joint stiffness matrix properties, number of joint stiffness invariants was obtained analytically such as the centre of stiffness, the principal translational stiffnesses, and the principal rotational stiffnesses. In corresponding to these principal stiffnesses, their principal axes have been also obtained. Altogether, a joint is assessed by six principal axes and six principal stiffnesses and its centre of stiffness. These formulations are new and show that a joint can be described in terms of inherent stiffness properties. It is expected that these will be better in characterising a joint in comparison to laxity based characterisation. The development of tissue path finding and wrapping algorithms are also introduced as new approaches. The musculoskeletal tissue wrapping involves calculating the shortest distance between two points on a meshed surface. A new heuristic algorithm was proposed. The heuristic is based on minimising the accumulative divergence from the straight line between two points on the surface and the direction of travel on the surface (i. e. bone). In contact and collision based development, the novel algorithm has been proposed that detects possible colliding points on the motion trajectory by redefining the distance as a two dimensional measure along the velocity approach vector and perpendicular to this vector. The perpendicular distance determines if there are potentially colliding points, and the distance along the velocity determines how close they are. The closest pair among the potentially colliding points gives the “time to collision”. The algorithm can eliminate the “fly pass” situation where very close points may not collide because of the direction of their relative velocity. All these developed algorithms and modelling theories, have been encompassed in the developed prototype software in order to simulate the anatomic joint articulations through modelling formulations developed. The software platform provides a capability for analysing joints as 6 DOF joints based on anatomic joint surfaces. The software is highly interactive and driven by well structured database, designed to be highly flexible for the future developments. Particularly, two case studies are carried out in this thesis in order to generate results relating to all the proposed elements of the study. The results obtained from the case studies show good agreement with previously published results or model based results obtained from Lifemod software, whenever comparison was possible. In some cases the comparison was not possible because there were no equivalent results; the results were supported by other indicators. The modelling based results were also supported by experiments performed in the Brunel Orthopaedic Research and Learning Centre. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
