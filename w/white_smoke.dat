5|$|The {{color of}} the smoke {{indicates}} the results to the people assembled in St Peter's Square. Dark smoke (fumata nera) indicates that the ballot {{did not result in}} an election, while <b>white</b> <b>smoke</b> (fumata bianca) announces that a new pope was chosen. Originally, in the event a pope was not elected, damp straw was added to the fire to create dark smoke. In the event a new pope was elected, the ballots were burned alone, creating <b>white</b> <b>smoke.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ba {{asserted}} {{that he would}} not take orders from Americans. He also argued that sending the 13 M113 armored personnel carriers through the Cong Ba Ky Canal would enable the Viet Cong to retreat because it might take too much time. An argument broke out between Vann and Ba. Finally, Vann radioed Ziegler at the command post at Tan Hiep and told him to ask the commander of the ARVN 7th Infantry Division to order Ba to move toward Ap Bac immediately. Shortly afterwards, Ziegler returned with Dam's permission, and Ba was ordered to move his M113 carriers {{in the direction of the}} <b>white</b> <b>smoke</b> that was rising from the burning hamlet. The American advisers were quietly confident that Ba's M113s could turn the tide of battle; on previous occasions, Viet Cong fighters often fled from the battlefield as soon as M113 armored personnel carriers turned up. However, in contrast to previous engagements, Viet Cong commander Hoang had ordered the soldiers of the 261st and 514th Battalions to throw everything they had at the South Vietnamese, as retreat through the muddy rice fields would result in certain death.|$|E

5|$|Finucane took {{leave in}} early September and his award {{for a second}} Bar was gazetted on 9 September. Circus 100B was flown on 20 September 1941. A three pronged attack was planned {{involving}} 23 squadrons and 270 Spitfires with bomber units acting as decoys. The Kenley wing was to provide escort for bombers hitting marshalling yards at Abbeville. 452 {{was one of three}} squadrons flying high cover. Immediately after crossing the coast at Saint-Valery-sur-Somme they were engaged by enemy aircraft. Finucane hit a Bf 109 which exploded forcing him to fly through the debris but within minutes 452 had lost three Spitfires. Finding himself and his wingman, Sergeant Chisholm alone he shot down a Bf 109 that attempted to attack his squadron-mate. He followed it briefly and it caught fire while emitting <b>white</b> <b>smoke.</b> Another Bf 109 turned in to attack Finucane but was shot down by Chisholm. Fighting their way back to the Channel Finucane dived and shot down a Bf 109 which went into a spin before he lost sight of it at approximately 500ft. Three successes had inflated Finucane's tally to 17.|$|E

25|$|In October 2012, {{the lead}} locomotive, a GE C30-7 #5017 {{was sent to}} MMA's repair shop {{following}} an engine failure. Because {{of the time and}} cost for a standard repair and the pressure to return the locomotive to service, the engine was repaired with an epoxy-like material that lacked the required strength and durability. This material failed in service, leading to engine surges and excessive black and <b>white</b> <b>smoke.</b> Eventually, oil began to accumulate {{in the body of the}} turbocharger, where it overheated and caught fire on the night of the derailment.|$|E
25|$|One {{round of}} balloting was to held the first evening. Then balloting was to {{continue}} {{until a new}} Pope was elected, with two ballots each morning and two each afternoon. The traditional procedure is that the ballots are burned, in times past reinforced by adding handfuls of dry or damp straw, to produce <b>white</b> <b>smoke</b> for a conclusive vote or black smoke for an inconclusive one. The straw {{had been replaced by}} chemically produced smoke. The ballot slips were to be burned at noon and 7pm Rome time (10:00 and 17:00 UTC) each day.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{functions}} of the Sistine Chapel is as a venue for the election of each successive pope in a conclave of the College of Cardinals. On the occasion of a conclave, a chimney is installed in the roof of the chapel, from which smoke arises as a signal. If <b>white</b> <b>smoke</b> appears, created by burning the ballots of the election, a new Pope has been elected. If a candidate receives less than a two-thirds vote, the cardinals send up black smoke — created by burning the ballots along with wet straw and chemical additives — it means that no successful election has yet occurred.|$|E

25|$|At 16:58 On 16 October 1948, Alon and Ezer Weizman {{took off}} from Herzliya to attack Egyptian forces {{operating}} {{in the vicinity of}} Isdud, not far from where both had participated in the squadron's combat debut in May. Returning to base, Alon had trouble lowering the plane's landing gear and consequently began flying violent maneuvers to try and force the wheels to lower. The Avia's engine started streaming <b>white</b> <b>smoke</b> and the aircraft began losing altitude before hitting the ground and bursting into flames, instantly killing Alon. He was survived by his wife, Mina, three months pregnant at the time. Alon's daughter, Michal, would later serve her mandatory IDF service with 101 Squadron.|$|E
25|$|Ongoing {{repair work}} is {{interrupted}} by a recurrence of grey smoke from the south-east side of unit 3 (the general area of the spent-fuel pool) seen at 15:55 and dying down by 17:55. Employees are evacuated from unit 3, but no changes in radiation measurements or reactor status are seen. No work {{was going on at}} the time (such as restoring power) which might have accounted for the fire. <b>White</b> <b>smoke,</b> probably steam, is also seen coming from unit 2 at 18:22 JST, accompanied by a temporary rise in radiation levels. A new power line is laid to unit 4 and unit 5 is transferred to its own external power from a transmission line instead of sharing the unit 6 diesel generators.|$|E
25|$|At {{approximately}} 14:30 TEPCO announces its {{belief that}} the fuel rod storage pool of unit 4 – which is located outside the containment area — may have begun boiling, raising the possibility that exposed rods could reach criticality. By midday NHK TV is reporting <b>white</b> <b>smoke</b> rising from the Fukushima I plant, which officials suggest is likely coming from reactor 3. Shortly afterwards all but {{a small group of}} remaining workers at the plant are placed on standby because of the radiation rising to a dangerous level of up to 1Sv/h. TEPCO temporarily suspended operations at the facility. A TEPCO press release states that workers had been withdrawn at 06:00 JST because of abnormal noises coming from one of the reactor pressure suppression chambers. Late in the evening Reuters reports that water is being poured into reactors 5 and 6.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Visibility {{of escape}} routes is most {{important}} to guarantee the safety of people indoors during fires. In {{the case of a}} fire, visibility is strongly in-fluenced by the smoke present in the room. In the present work, the extinction co-efficient of the visible light has been experimentally measured {{in the presence of the}} smoke produced by four different test fires, named TF 2, TF 3, TF 4, and TF 5. Tests have been carried out in a specially suited test room in the Italian Fire De-partment Research Center, provided with instruments to measure the optical density of smoke and the spectral extinction coefficient. The results show that, between the smokes produced in the test fires, TF 3 be-haves as the most absorbent one, for the so-called <b>white</b> <b>smokes</b> (with a predomi-nance of particles of condensed liquid), and TF 4 for the black smokes (with predominantly soot particles). Results can also be used to quantitatively calculate the light intensity reduc-tion due to the possible fire that could be produced in a room, in order to properly design the emergency lighting system of the escape ways. Verification tests with a normal emergency lamp have been performed to check this statement. A differ-ence between the computed and measured reduction of illuminance has been dis-covered, and can be ascribed to a large amount of scattered light in the <b>white</b> <b>smokes.</b> *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed...|$|R
