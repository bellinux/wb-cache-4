[...] Taylor York adds [...] "A lot of people would hear the song and assume it would be about the story of people still being in love, but <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> appealing about Isaac's treatment is that he wanted to capture what love feels like ...

I just refused." [...] Ray has singled out Mick Avory's drum performance on the song, saying, [...] "Just keep Mick Avory nervous, and you'll get great performances from him. He's responsible {{for some of the}} great comedy drum parts. His drum roll into 'Come Dancing,'... it's totally a beat late.

2500|$|Philolaus (4th century BCE) {{was one of}} {{the first}} to hypothesize {{movement}} of the Earth, probably inspired by Pythagoras' theories about a spherical, moving globe.

2500|$|This {{interest}} in education continued into her opera career. For many years, Blackwell {{participated in a}} program called the [...] "Affiliate Artists" [...] where {{she went into the}} community and talked to people one-on-one to educate them about and inspire {{interest in}} opera. Blackwell says, [...] "We don't have audience participation anymore, partly because of being raised on television. We have become an audience that receives entertainment in a passive way. I think in order to participate you have to have knowledge and knowledge means {{you have to take the}} time to sit down and educate. When you are able to communicate with people and show them you're just another human being with a gift, it makes all the difference. My gift happens to be singing. When you go to an opera you see so many people, but you don't have an opportunity to have that one-on-one contact and that's <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> great about that program." ...|$|E

2500|$|Not {{long after}} Abe began work at Yoshidaya, Ishida began making amorous {{advances}} towards her. Omiya had never satisfied Abe sexually, {{and she gave}} in to Ishida. In mid-April, Ishida and Abe initiated their sexual relationship in the restaurant {{to the accompaniment of}} a romantic ballad sung by one of the restaurant's geishas. On April 23, 1936 Abe and Ishida met for a pre-arranged sexual encounter at a teahouse, or machiai—the contemporary equivalent of a love hotel—in the Shibuya neighborhood. Planning only for a short 'fling', the couple instead remained in bed for four days. On the night of April 27, 1936, they moved to another teahouse in the distant neighborhood of Futako Tamagawa where they continued to drink and have sex, occasionally with the accompaniment of a geisha's singing, and would continue even as maids entered the room to serve sake. They next moved to the Ogu neighborhood, and Ishida did not actually return to his restaurant until the morning of May 8, 1936, after an absence of about two weeks. Of Ishida, Abe later said, [...] "It is hard to say exactly <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> good about Ishida. But it was impossible to say anything bad about his looks, his attitude, his skill as a lover, the way he expressed his feelings. I had never met such a sexy man." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hipparchus {{also studied}} {{the motion of}} the Moon and {{confirmed}} the accurate values for two periods of its motion that Chaldean astronomers are widely presumed to have possessed before him, whatever their ultimate origin. The traditional value (from Babylonian System B) for the mean synodic month is 29days;31,50,8,20 (sexagesimal) = 29.5305941... days. Expressed as 29days + 12hours + 793/1080hours this value has been used later in the Hebrew calendar. The Chaldeans also knew that 251 synodic months ≈ 269 anomalistic months. [...] Hipparchus used the multiple of this period by a factor of 17, because that interval is also an eclipse period, and is also close to an integer number of years (4267 moons : 4573 anomalistic periods : 4630.53 nodal periods : 4611.98 lunar orbits : 344.996 years : 344.982 solar orbits : 126,007.003 days : 126,351.985 rotations). <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> exceptional and useful about the cycle was that all 345-year-interval eclipse pairs occur slightly over 126,007 days apart within a tight range of only about ±1/2 hour, guaranteeing (after division by 4267) an estimate of the synodic month correct to one part in order of magnitude 10 million. The 345 year periodicity is why the ancients could conceive of a mean month and quantify it so accurately that it is even today correct to {{a fraction of a second}} of time.|$|E
