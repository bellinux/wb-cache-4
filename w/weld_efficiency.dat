40|$|AbstractIn {{recognition}} that pressure equipment welds {{that have not}} undergone a full volumetric inspection may contain internal defects, a <b>weld</b> <b>efficiency</b> is introduced. For spot volumetric inspection which is typically 10 % of the weld length the <b>weld</b> <b>efficiency</b> is taken as 0. 85. Of interest is that this factor is universally adopted in all known pressure equipment codes around the world. Its origins are obscure and to the authors’ best knowledge, has gone unchallenged for the past 88 years. Additional interest {{is the use of}} 0. 7 <b>weld</b> <b>efficiency</b> for a weld that has undergone no volumetric inspection. This is prevalent in many international pressure equipment code, but not all. This paper revisits these factors. It considers how they were developed and explores a more rigorous probabilistic approach based on the amount of volumetric inspection and the likelihood of defects. It also considers the closely associated design factors. Understanding also that weld technology has developed since the early 1900 and in particular with the introduction of new technologies such as submerged arc welding, it may not be unreasonable to expect these weld efficiencies to differ from that initially developed. While the paper is not conclusive in its findings, it highlights there is justification to question the weld efficiencies adopted and proposes a program to develop more rigorous values...|$|E

This project involves background work on butt-welding of injection moulded polypropylene ASTM bars followed by a programme on the welding of extruded polypropylene strapping tape. In the butt-welding study, the effects of processing conditions of the bars, welding variables, and annealing treatments, on the morphology and strength of the welds, were investigated. Light and scanning electron microscopy {{have been used for}} the analysis of morphological structure and fracture surface texture. Tensile tests have been used to assess the weld strength either at room temperature and at sub-zero temperature. In the strapping tape programme the influence of the tape orientation and the welding temperature on <b>weld</b> <b>efficiency</b> was analysed. The orientation of the tapes, obtained by means of five different draw ratios in the manufacturing plant, was assessed by doing shrinkage and optical measurements. Shear and peeling tests have been used to study the <b>weld</b> <b>efficiency.</b> From the butt-welding study was concluded that the microstructure of the injection moulded bars affected the weld zone morphology. The annealing at l 52 degrees C before and after welding caused a reduction in weld strength. However the oriented zones were apparently unaffected by these thermal treatments. In that the strapping tape welding is concerned, an optimum welding tool temperature could be identified. The draw ratio of the tapes seems not to affect the optimum weld temperature, but it influences the efficiency of the welds...|$|E
40|$|Within the ADO (Airbus-DLR-ONERA {{research}} cooperation {{funded by}} Airbus) FSW project, scenarios for repairing FSW joints that {{had turned out}} to be defective were developed. In the present paper, full-length re-welding of the complete joint line and resulting change in mechanical behaviour was examined. The work was performed on defective butt welds intentionally made at Airbus Operations GmbH in Bremen. At DLR, defective and repaired FSW joints were checked by high frequency ultrasonics and electrical conductivity measurements through the eddy current technique. Mechanical behaviour was characterised in terms of bending, tensile and S-N tests. Defective FSW joints could completely be repaired by a single re-welding process. A second re-welding was not observed to generate any kind of improvement. Conversely, it slightly reduced strength and ductility. The decrease in strength was the lowest for 2024 -T 3. 2198 -T 8 and 6156 -T 6 took a less favourable position, since the artificially aged tempers exhibited higher sensitivity towards additional thermal cycles.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The literature relating to the laser welding {{of a number of}} alloys was studied, this revealed gaps in the current state of knowledge. It was found that no indepth parametric or inicrostructural investigations had been carried out into the laser welding of non-ferrous alloys. Although problems associated with the laser welding of aluminium alloys had been identified, there was little in the literature to suggest an indepth study into the effect of surface modifications in enhancing the laser weldability of this material had been carried out. The laser welding of aluminium based metal matrix composites has also yet to be studied in detail. A programme was therefore set up to carry out an indepth investigation into the laser welding of a number of alloys namely; Nimonics C 263, and PE 11, aluminium 6061, and aluminium 6061 based boron fibre reinforced, and silicon carbide particulate reinforced metal matrix composites. The study was aimed at developing an understanding of the microstructural effects of the laser welding process on the alloys, and assessing the structural integrity of the resultant welds. The effect of laser processing parameters such as laser power, laser beam traverse speed, lens focal length, and the manipulation of these parameters on the <b>welding</b> <b>efficiency</b> and <b>weld</b> area integrity was also investigated. Other tasks within the project included a study on the possibility of using an anodic film to enhance the laser weldability of Al 6061. Finally attempts were made to identify novel phases observed in the weld area of the composite materials. Nimonics C 263, and PEll exhibited laser welds free of cracks and porosity. The difference in composition between the two alloys did not result in any significant dissimilarities in their response to the laser welding process. The welds in both alloys exhibited a fine columnar dendritic microstructure, and while carbides were observed in the interdendritic regions of the welds, electron optical analysis did not reveal any y precipitates in this region. It was concluded that for the welding of thin gauge materials above a threshold laser power the resultant <b>welding</b> <b>efficiency</b> shows a greater dependence on laser beam mode, and laser spot size, than on laser power, and beam traverse speed. Aluminium 6061 was not easily welded with a laser in its as received form, and the welds showed some degree of porosity. Anodising was found to improve the <b>welding</b> <b>efficiency</b> in this material. While the presence of an anodic film on the metal surface increased the <b>welding</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the alloy, no relationship was found between the thickness of the anodic film and <b>welding</b> <b>efficiency</b> in the range of film thicknesses investigated in this work. Weld regions were observed to be cellular dendritic in structure, with narrow heat affected zones. No precipitates or low melting point phases could be identified in the weld region. Melt zones were successfully produced in the composite materials, with the main problem encountered being that of porosity adjacent to the weld bead. It was shown that manipulation of the laser welding parameters resulted in a decrease in this porosity. In the weld beads, a number of novel phases were observed. These were identified with the aid of TEM, and SIMS analysis techniques...|$|R

40|$|A new laser-assisted {{plasma arc}} welding process with a coaxial {{arrangement}} of arc and plasma was developed. A low-power fiber laser beam (λYb = 1. 07 μm) with maximum power of 300 W is guided through a hollow cathode. This combined process is of special interest regarding the costs and power input.

Therefore, the experimental setup was enhanced by a laser displacement inside the hollow plasma cathode.

Significant development in improving <b>weld</b> <b>efficiency,</b> during the past decades, still have their drawbacks, specifically in the weld strength properties. The recent innovative technologies have created smallest possible solid material known as nanomaterial and their introduction in welding production has improved the weld strength properties and to overcome unstable microstructures in the weld. This study utilizes a qualitative research method, to elaborate the methods of introducing nanomaterial to the weldments and the characteristic of the welds produced by different welding processes. The study mainly focuses on changes in the microstructural formation and strength properties on the welded joint and also discusses those factors influencing such improvements, due to the addition of nanomaterials. The effect of nanomaterial addition in welding process modifies the physics of joining region, thereby, resulting in significant improvement in the strength properties, with stable microstructure in the weld. The addition of nanomaterials in the welding processes are, through coating on base metal, addition in filler metal and utilizing nanostructured base metal. However, due to its insignificant size, the addition of nanomaterials directly to the weld, would poses complications.

40|$|The {{research}} of this thesis {{is focused on}} the optimization of laser beam welding of PMlOOO with respect to its high temperature mechanica! properties. This nickel chromium alloy is used for the thermal protection system of the re-entry test vehicle of ESA; Expert. With respect to the ceramic tiles which are used in conventional thermal protection systems, metals {{do have a lot of}} sustainable advantages. For instance the ductility and the self healing capabilities will have a positive effect on the maintenance characteristics of the thermal protection system. PMlOOO makes use of yttrium oxide (1203) for the dispersion hardening which is responsible for the good mechanica! properties at high temperatures. This research focused therefore on the relation between the yttrium oxide in original state in the welds and the mechanica! properties of the welds. To optimize the laser beam wel ding process the wel ding speed (v) and the laser beam power (P) is varied. The first weld series (weld series I) is investigated with optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, hardness tests and morphology research. From these results three weld parameter combinations are chosen (weld series II) which are used for tensile tests at temperatures from room temperature up to 1250 °C. The parameters are chosen such that the infiuence of the welding speed and the welding power is individually measured. There are also tensile tests performed on the PMlOOO base material to set a reference. With optical microscopy it is shown that the macrostructure of the welds exists out of dendrites. In the middle of the weld the dendrites form a center line. The scanning electron microscope showed large amounts of black spots in the weld. With EDX analysis the elements in the spots are identified as titanium, yttrium, aluminum and oxygen. During welding the yttrium oxide is melted and farms yttrium aluminum garnet (YAG: Y 3 Al 50 12) in these spots. A part of this material is mixed out at the surface of the weld.

40|$|The {{challenges}} of weight reduction and good strength in automotive industry have drawn considerable interest in thixocasting technologies. Joining of such components with conventional fusion welding creates voids, hot cracking, distortion in shape, {{and more importantly}} evolution of dendritic microstructure that ultimately would lead to inferior mechanical properties of the weld region. Thus, the purpose of making thixocast component is lost. The friction welding which is a solid state joining process can avoid defects associated with melting and solidification in a typical fusion weld and can be a promising alternative. This process produces a weld under compressive force at the contact of workpieces rotating or moving relative to one another to produce heat and plastically displacing material from the faying surfaces. Research on semisolid processing has its origin in the early 1970 s. However, from the literature survey on semisolid processing it is clear that, till date, not much {{work has been done}} in field of joining of semisolid processed components. In the area of solid state welding, in particular, {{it is not at all}} explored. In view of this, the present work is focused on exploration of joining of Thixocast A 356 Aluminium alloy component by friction welding and comparison of its performance with friction weld of conventionally cast sample of the same alloy. The study is carried out experimentally as well as numerically. Moreover, the material behaviour of thixocast component at elevated temperature in solid state is also described with the help of processing maps and constitutive modelling. The hot workability of thixocast and conventionally cast A 356 alloy is evaluated with the help of processing maps developed on the basis of the dynamic materials model approach using the flow stress data obtained from the isothermal compression test in wide range of temperature (300 - 500 ℃) and strain rates (0. 001 s- 1 - 10 s- 1). The domains of the processing map are interpreted in terms of the associated microstructural mechanism. On comparing the flow stress at elevated temperature of thixocast and conventionally cast A 356 alloy samples, it is observed that the flow stress of the latter showed higher value at different strain level, temperature and strain rates. This indicates that the flow property of the thixocast alloy sample is better than that of the conventionally cast one (i. e. response to plastic flow is better for the former); while at room temperature thixocast sample has higher strength. Moreover to investigate the general nature of the influence of strain, strain rate and temperature on the compressive deformation characteristics of thixocast A 356 and conventionally cast A 356 aluminium alloy, a comprehensive model describing the relationship of the flow stress, strain rate and temperature of the alloys at elevated temperatures is proposed by hyperbolic-sine Arrhenius-type equation and Johnson-Cook model. The validity of descriptive results based on the proposed constitutive equation is also investigated and a comparison between two constitutive models is also made. In order to numerically model the friction welding process of a thixocast A 356 aluminium alloy and conventionally cast alloy of same material using a finite element method (FEM), temperature dependent physical properties, mechanical properties as well as viscoplastic constitutive equations were used in the model. A two- dimensional axisymmetric finite element model has been developed. The modelling is based on a coupled thermomechanical approach. First, a nonlinear, transient two-dimensional heat transfer model is developed to determine the temperature fields. Later, the temperature fields are used as input for a nonlinear, two-dimensional structural model in order to predict the distortions and von Mises stress. The finite element models are parametrically built using APDL (ANSYS Parametric Design Language) provided by ANSYS. The validation of the model is carried out by comparing with the experiment. Once validated, the thermomechanical model was used to perform parametric studies in order to investigate effects of various process parameters on temperature and stress distribution in the workpieces. This helps in deciding the range of parameters for friction welding experiments in order to get good weld. Both thixocast and conventionally cast samples exhibited similar temperature distribution during the friction welding process, because of identical thermophysical properties. The magnitude of von Mises stress distribution during friction welding of thixocast A 356 sample is found to be lower than that of the conventionally cast sample. It is because of their different constitutive behaviour at elevated temperature. Moreover, the developed FEM model can be successfully used to predict the residual stress at various locations for different set of parameters and geometry for friction welding of thixocast and conventionally cast A 356 alloy. This helps in reducing time consuming and expensive experiments on residual stress measurement. The chosen experiments based on Taguchi L 27 orthogonal array were conducted on the friction welding machine which works on the principles of continuous drive-mechanism. The experimental specimens were machined from thixocast A 356 aluminium alloy connecting rods as well as conventionally cast A 356 aluminium alloy ingot in the form of cylindrical bars of dimensions 85 mm length and 20 mm diameter. The parameters used for welding were friction pressure, rpm, forge pressure, burn-off, and upset pressure. The effects of welding parameters on performance characteristics (i. e. tensile strength and <b>weld</b> <b>efficiency)</b> were evaluated. Taguchi method was applied to investigate the influence of each parameter on strength of joints and evaluate the combination of parameters that leads to the highest weld strength. Accordingly optimum process parameters was identified which helps in achieving the tensile strength of more than parent material. The optimized process parameters for friction welding of thixocast A 356 aluminium alloy are rpm = 500, friction pressure = 60, upset time = 5, upset pressure = 100 and burn off = 5. The empirical relationships were also developed to predict the tensile strength. The developed relationship can be effectively used to predict the tensile strength of welded joint with a correlation coefficient of 0. 86, which indicates the strong positive relationship between predicted and experimental data. Friction welding of thixocast A 356 aluminium alloy helps to achieve very fine eutectic silicon particles of the order of 0. 4 at the interface due to severe plastic deformation taking place during welding. Obtaining such fine eutectic silicon particles is difficult to be achieved within few seconds of processing by any other method. The hardness variation of friction welded thixocast alloy shows higher value as compared to that of a conventionally cast sample in the heat affected zone, which indicates better weld strength of the former. This was also confirmed by the tensile strength studied and fatigue test. This indicates that weldability of cast alloys will get improved if the microstructure is modified to globular type...|$|E

In the LAC company there are three types of products made. At laboratory furnaces the efficiency can be enhance by using fixtures. At other standard and atypical furnaces is very difficult to design fixtures or positioners because of their different sizes. Big complication can be also a company location on second floor. The most suitable product regarding to <b>welding</b> <b>efficiency</b> enhancement is big batch production of heaters. For this type the welding time can be shortened by means of a robotic workstation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Copper and {{aluminium}} alloy could be welded by {{friction stir welding}} (FSW) but it is quite difficult to achieve a defect-free welding joint for welding dissimilar materials because of the enormous difference of their thermo-physical performances. In this paper, another friction stir tool was applied as a heating source to preheat the copper side to 150 ~ 200 ℃ in the welding direction. Preheating temperature can make up the lost heat, improve the temperature of copper plate before the FSW process, achieve the refining grains, and then obtain a high quality welding joint. We concentrated on hybrid heat-source equipments design and procedure optimization in our studies. The microstructure, mechanical properties and phase constituents of FSW joints were studied through mechanical test and metallographic analysis. The {{results indicated that the}} hybrid FSW technology with preheating for copper T 2 /aluminium 5 A 06 dissimilar materials can not only improve the <b>welding</b> <b>efficiency,</b> but also obtain the high quality welding joint. This special welding technology could solve the welding problems of Al-Cu dissimilar materials and had a good potential for application in aerospace manufacturing...|$|R
40|$|It {{is usually}} a lot easier and less {{expensive}} to galvanize steel before it is welded into useful products. Galvanizing afterwards is almost impossible. In this research work, Galvanized Steel was welded by using the ER 308 L stainless steel filler material. This work was done to find out an alternative way of welding and investigate the effects of heat input on the mechanical properties of butt welded joints of Galvanized Steel. A 13. 7 kW maximum capacity MIG welding machine was used to join 1. 6 mm thick sheet of galvanized steel with V groove and no gap between mm. Heat inputs was gradually increased from 21. 06 to 25. 07 joules/mm in this study. The result shows almost macro defects free welding and with increasing heat input the ultimate tensile strength and <b>welding</b> <b>efficiency</b> decrease. The Vickers hardness also decreases at HAZ with increasing heat input and for each individual specimen; hardness was lowest in heat affected zone (HAZ), intermediate in base metal and maximum in welded zone. The fracture for all specimens was in the heat affected zone while testing in the universal testing machine...|$|R
40|$|Friction Stir Welding (FSW) is a {{relatively}} new joining process that has exhibited many advantages over traditional arc welding processes, including greatly reducing distortion and eliminating solidification. The present work aims to determine the feasibility to weld two pieces of aluminum pipe by friction stir welding process and study the effect on the mechanical properties of welding joints. Special welding fixture fixed on conventional milling machine has been conducted to attempt this welding and group of welding parameters. Three tool rotational speeds (500, 630, 800 rpm) with four welding speeds (0. 5, 1, 2, 3 mm/sec) for each rotational speed had been used to study the effect of each parameters (tool rotation, weld speed) on mechanical and microstructure properties of welded joints. Mechanical properties of welded joints were investigated using different mechanical tests including non destructive test (visual inspection, X-ray) and destructive test (tensile test, microhardeness and microstructure). Based on the stir welding experiments conducted in this study the results show that aluminum pipe (AA 6061 -T 6) can be welded by (FSW) process with a maximum <b>welding</b> <b>efficiency</b> (61. 7 %) in terms of ultimate tensile strength, using 630 (RPM) rotational speed, 1 (mm/sec) traveling speed...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{its high}} <b>efficiency,</b> {{autogenous}} keyhole <b>welding</b> is not well-accepted for duplex stainless steels because it causes excessive ferrite in as-welded duplex microstructure, {{which leads to}} a degradation in toughness and corrosion properties of the material. Combining the deep penetration characteristics of plasma arc welding in keyhole mode and metal deposition capability of gas metal arc welding, hybrid plasma - gas metal arc welding process has considered for providing a proper duplex microstructure without compromising the <b>welding</b> <b>efficiency.</b> 11. 1 mm-thick standard duplex stainless steel plates were joined in a single-pass using this novel technique. Same plates were also subjected to conventional gas metal arc and plasma arc welding processes, providing benchmarks for the investigation of the weldability of the material. In the first place, the hybrid welding process enabled us to achieve less heat input compared to gas metal arc welding. Consequently, the precipitation of secondary phases, which are known to be detrimental to the toughness and corrosion resistance of duplex stainless steels, was significantly suppressed in both fusion and heat affected zones. Secondly, contrary to other keyhole techniques, proper cooling time and weld metal chemistry were achieved during the process, facilitating sufficient reconstructive transformation of austenite in the ferrite phase...|$|R
40|$|During {{high power}} CO 2 laser beam welding, the plasma above the keyhole has a {{shielding}} effect that {{it not only}} absorbs part of the laser energy but also defocuses the laser beam. As a result, the <b>welding</b> <b>efficiency</b> and the aspect ratio of the welds are influenced. In {{order to reduce the}} effect of plasma, helium as a plasma control gas has been used successfully and effectively. However, the cost of helium in Southeast Asia is extremely high and therefore the production cost is significantly increased when helium is used as a continuous bleeding plasma control gas. To search for an alternative plasma control technique, feasibility in using magnetic effect as a control tool is explored in this paper. The influences of the magnetic field strength, laser power, welding speed, field direction and shielding gas (e. g. helium and argon) on the penetration depth and the width of bead were also investigated. Experimental results indicated that the magnetic field can influence the shielding effect of the plasma without using plasma control gas. It was found that at a suitable magnetic field strength the penetration depth was increased by about 7 %, but no significant difference on the width of bead was found. Moreover, it was shown that the plasma control effect can be achieved at low magnetic field strength and the penetration depth can be increased significantly under argon atmosphere.

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} European network NeT round robin {{activities}} on measuring and simulating the residual stresses generated by laying a single weld bead {{on a flat}} austenitic steel plate. The activities are described, as are the main results obtained. From 2002 to 2010, fourteen independent sets of residual stress measurements were made using five different techniques, and subjected to detailed statistical analysis to evaluate best estimate profiles for validation of finite element predictions. In parallel, over forty finite element simulations were performed, examining {{a wide range of}} solution variables and their impact on the predicted residual stresses. This large body of work has allowed NeT Task Group 1 to develop a reliable thermal solution strategy. This is described and involves a global weld heat input calibrated against far field thermocouples followed by derivation of detailed weld heat source characteristics by matching the weld fusion boundary profile. The accurate thermal solutions then allow the most important mechanical solution variables to be isolated and optimised. An important variable is found to be the material hardening model, with mixed isotropic kinematic hardening being the most accurate for the AISI 316 L plate material. Other solution variables, such as the <b>welding</b> <b>efficiency,</b> the mesh design and the thermal boundary conditions, are found to be of much less importance. The NeT TG 1 specimen is described here in sufficient detail to serve as a benchmark for both finite element simulation and measurement of weld residual stresse...|$|R

Predictions of the model are compatible with microfissuring tests on eight 0. 25 -in. thick test plates. The model takes into account weld power and speed, <b>weld</b> loss (<b>efficiency),</b> parameters and material characteristics. Besides the usual material characteristics (thermal and strength properties), a temperature and grain size dependent critical fracture strain is required by the model. The model is based upon fundamental physical theory (i. e., {{it is not a}} mere data interpolation system), and can be extended to other metals by suitable parameter changes...|$|R
30|$|The {{stiffened}} {{thin plate}} structure, where the thinner plate {{is reinforced by}} a thicker plate called a frame, has been claimed as being a cost-effective way of achieving a high-performance vehicle structure (Gean et al. 1999). This structure is generally welded by resistance spot welding due to its advantages in <b>welding</b> <b>efficiency</b> and suitability for automation (Hou et al. 2007). The parts of the structure in which spot welding cannot be implemented, such as the double sheeting structure, complex structure, and the construction with the profile stiffener, plug welding was applied instead of spot welding. Welding schedule of plug welding has been offered by American Welding Society (AWS) (2004) and previous study (Tsuruta et al. 1952). According to this recommendation, the weld quality is achieved when the hole diameter of plug welding is 8 [*]+[*]t (in mm), where t is {{the thickness of the}} joined plate (in mm). It is very useful in finding good weld schedules for equal-thickness welding, but confusing in that for unequal-thickness plate welding and generally developed by and practiced within individual manufacturers (Agashe and Zhang 2003). Some of them use the thickness of thinner material, and others use the average of joined material thickness in that empirical formula. There are a lot of scientific papers dealing with static and fatigue behaviors of spot-welded dissimilar metal joints (Alenius et al. 2006; Hasanbasoglu and Kacar 2007; Jamasri et al. 2011; Vural et al. 2006), but only a few studies have been published concerning those of plug welded. The objective of the present work is to investigate the static, fatigue, and corrosion fatigue of plug-welded dissimilar metals between 3.0 -mm carbon steel and 1.0 -mm austenitic stainless steel.|$|R
