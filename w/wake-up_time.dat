40|$|Abstract. Duty-cycling in {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSNs) {{has both}} beneficial effects on network lifetime and negative effects on application performance due to the inability of a sensor to perform while it is sleeping. In a typical scenario, the active periods of nodes are randomly initialized, leading to unpredictable and often sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a fully decentralized wake-up scattering algorithm that uniformly spreads <b>wake-up</b> <b>times</b> of nearby sensors. Interestingly, our approach is complementary and dual to existing ap-proaches that aim at synchronizing (instead of scattering) times, and to those that focus on spatial (instead of temporal) coverage. Wake-up scattering is beneficial in several application scenarios, three of which are considered here: responsive-ness to one-hop queries from a mobile base station, sensing coverage for event detection, and latency in multi-hop communication. Our evaluation shows that, w. r. t. a random assignment of <b>wake-up</b> <b>times,</b> <b>wake-up</b> scattering brings improve-ments in all these measures, along with {{a positive impact on}} the network lifetime. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A {{lifetime}} {{of several years}} for wireless sensor nodes can be achieved if their activity period is minimized. This {{can be done by}} using low duty cycle protocols. One of the challenges of these low duty cycle protocols is the synchronization of <b>wake-up</b> <b>times.</b> This becomes even more demanding if a wired central sink, which takes care of the schedule, is missing and communication links are unreliable. In this paper, we present our own Distributed Low Duty Cycle MAC (DLDC-MAC) protocol, which achieves a {{lifetime of}} two years using off-the-shelf sensor nodes. Our protocol synchronizes <b>wake-up</b> <b>times</b> of nodes in a fully decentralized way, even when plenty of transmitted packets get lost. We evaluated this in a real world scenario with 10 sensor nodes working for 14 days in our office space.

40|$|A Caucus-based medium {{access control}} {{protocol}} (C-MAC) is proposed to reduce the end to end delay and battery consumption of the sensor nodes deployed in the monitoring of various smart grid regions, such as substation, pole and wires, perimeter security, real time and non-real-time monitoring using wireless sensor networks. The objective is to prolong the network lifetime and to reduce the end to end delay by mitigating the energy-hole problem and by eliminating bottlenecks significantly by using caucus based efficient synchronization techniques in multi-hop square grid topology of the wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The protocol self-reliantly and adaptively schedules node’s <b>wake-up</b> <b>times,</b> decreases idle listening and collisions, increases network throughput, and extends network lifetime. It induces a low duty cycle for adjusting <b>wake-up</b> <b>times</b> of sensor nodes. The appropriate selection of active and sleep time slots and next hop relay nodes are proposed to minimize the data transmission latency and to reduce battery consumption to increase the network lifetime. The uniform and synchronized transmission of the data packets is of prime importance to improve the network performance. Simulation results justify that the proposed C-MAC protocol increases the network lifetime, successful data transmission ratio along-with the reduction in end to end delay.

The SleepWell works well with multiple APs in a wireless vicinity when there are no hidden terminals.

Here, the duty cycle of a node is defined as the ratio between its active time and the scheduling period, i.e., T. We note that WSNs can employ a synchronous wake-up schedule, that is, nodes wake up at the same time. However, nodes will have to coordinate and synchronize their <b>wake-up</b> <b>time</b> globally and, hence, incur high signaling overheads.

In this work, we investigate a power-gating strategy for through-silicon via (TSV) -based 3 D IC stacking structures. Power-gating control is becoming more complicated as more dies are stacked. We combine the on-chip PDN and TSV in a multilayered 3 D IC to perform power-gating analysis of the static and dynamic voltage drops and in-rush current. Then, we propose a novel power-gating strategy that optimizes the in-rush current profile, subject to the voltage-drop constraints. Our power-gating strategy provides a minimal wakeup latency such that the voltage noise safety margins are not violated.

However, in wireless sensor networks, nodes are powered by batteries, meaning, they have finite energy.

This means that a transmission from a node may not reach all of its neighbors simultaneously. Consequently, any developed broadcast protocols must consider collisions and the <b>wake-up</b> <b>times</b> of neighboring nodes. Henceforth, this paper studies the minimum latency broadcast scheduling problem in duty cycled multi-hop wireless networks (MLBSDC), which remains NP hard.

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} ORD, an {{opportunistic}} routing protocol {{for data collection}} in wireless sensor networks, where applications have certain requirements on packet delays. ORD shares basic features with ORW where forwarder sets are computed based on EDC, and nodes take advantage of multiple candidate forwarders and their random <b>wake-up</b> <b>times</b> to quickly transfer their packets. ORD follows ORIA’s approach where nodes {{hold on to their}} packets before forwarding, and meanwhile shorten their sleep periods to aggregate packets from downstream nodes. However, unlike ORIA, ORD uses feedback information on residual energy levels and maximum hop distance in order to control packet hold times, so that the network lifetime is maximized while packet delay requirements are met. Simulation results show that ORD outperforms ORIA in both network lifetime and ratio of late packets. In summary, ORD provides network operators with a tuning knob which controls target packet delay and optimizes parameters accordingly so that the operators do not need to specify protocol parameters such as packet hold time for each node.|$|R
40|$|Energy {{efficient}} protocols {{are important}} in ad hoc networks since battery life for wireless devices is limited. The IEEE 802. 11 protocol specifies a simple power save mechanism (PSM) to conserve energy. However, the protocol needlessly wastes energy when traffic is light in a network, and significantly increases packet latency. In this paper, we consider three techniques to improve the 802. 11 PSM protocol. The first technique, Carrier Sense ATIM, uses carrier sensing to drastically reduce the energy wasted listening to the channel in 802. 11 PSM. The second technique, Dynamic ATIM, dynamically extends the listening period in 802. 11 PSM based on packet advertisements that are overheard. In this manner, {{we are able to}} advertise data packets just as effectively as 802. 11 PSM while significantly reducing wasteful listening. The final technique, Per-Link Beacon Intervals, allows sender and receiver pairs to schedule their <b>wake-up</b> <b>times</b> independent from all the other nodes in the network based on past packet arrival times.
