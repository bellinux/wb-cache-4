40|$|System {{identification}} of offshore floating platforms is usually performed by testing small-scale models in <b>wave</b> <b>tanks,</b> where controlled conditions, such as still water for free decay tests, regular and irregular wave loading can be represented. However, this approach {{may result in}} constraints on model dimensions, testing time, and costs of the experimental activity. For such reasons, intermediate-scale field modelling of offshore floating structures may become an interesting as well as cost-effective alternative in a near future. Clearly, since the open sea is not a controlled environment, traditional system identification may become challenging and less precise. In this paper, a new approach based on Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD) method for Operational Modal Analysis is proposed and validated against numerical simulations in ANSYS AQWA v. 16. 0 on a simple spar-type structure. The results obtained match well with numerical predictions, showing that this new approach, opportunely coupled with more traditional <b>wave</b> <b>tanks</b> techniques, proves to be very promising to perform field-site {{identification of}} the model structures...|$|R

An empirical power-law model yields a high correlation between sigma- 0 and wind friction velocity, but, because systematic anomalies arise, we reexamine a turbulence approach that delineates low and high regimes with a transition at a wind friction velocity of approximately 25 cm/s.

The aim of the experiment is to investigate the effects of directional energy distribution on the statistical properties of surface gravity waves. Different degrees of directionality have been considered, starting from long-crested waves up to directional distributions with a spread of +/- 30 degrees at the spectral peak. Particular attention is given to the tails of the distribution function of the surface elevation, wave heights and wave crests. Comparison with a simplified model based on second-order theory is reported. The results show that for long-crested, steep and narrow-banded waves, the second-order theory underestimates the probability of occurrence of large waves.
