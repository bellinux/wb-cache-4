As in the rest of Ireland, integration of bus and rail services is very limited though there are some [...] "feeder bus" [...] routes for which it is possible to buy a through ticket valid for both the rail and bus <b>section</b> <b>of</b> the <b>journey.</b> Travel passes and integrated ticketing (Leap Cards) for DART, Luas and Dublin Bus services were introduced in 2011.|$|R

However they could also be seen pulling colliers' trains between Barry and Porth as well as excursion trains from various locations to Barry Island. In particular 2 B1 class locomotives, nos. 111 and 122, were used to take excursion trains from the Rhymney Railway to Barry for those visiting the National Eisteddfod held there in 1920.

5000|$|On 18 August 1981, half of {{the first}} and second sets derailed and rolled north of Waiouru, when the {{northbound}} service was descending curves. Passengers reported that the railcar had been travelling quickly over this <b>section</b> <b>of</b> the <b>journey</b> and the speed around curves just before the derailment had been concerning. The subsequent enquiry found that many of the speed restriction boards for the curves in the area were missing or misleading; a full audit of speed restrictions across the entire rail network was one of the enquiry outcomes. Four people were killed and another 16 injured. The railcars were replaced by the [...] "Blue Fern" [...] on Wednesdays for three years until May 1984, to allow the two remaining railcar sets to be serviced while the damaged set was being repaired.|$|R

The two got on rather well and maintained a close correspondence almost right up to his own death.In his concerns about the encroaching blandness of modern design, he was the heir of literary men who had similarly been critics of the spread of an Edwardian suburbia, such as E.M. Forster ("success was indistinguishable from failure" [...] there), and John Betjeman ("red-brick rashes"), and which fed into the Campaign to Protect Rural England among others. This strain of thinking was, however, to become largely concerned with conservation of the heritage in affluent areas, rather than with Nairn's urban fringe. And like Betjeman, Nairn fought {{against the forces of}} subtopia, the obliteration of British heritage - though the forces of subtopia invariably prevailed; one example, his defence of Northampton's Emporium Arcade - 'if they do pull this place down it'll be a diabolical shame.' It was demolished June 1972.|$|R

It was to be the first of a new programme of trans-historical collection based exhibitions that would address the museum's need to focus more on working with its collection for reasons of saving costs, but also as a way of expanding and deepening knowledge of the collection through research based conceptual questioning...|$|R

50|$|Maria Anna {{had left}} Madrid for Vienna in December 1629. The travel {{took more than}} a year. Enroute by sea, in Genoa {{complications}} arose due to an epidemic of the plague that erupted in the Italian Peninsula. For this reason, the cortege was unable to stop in Bologna, where Cardinal Antonio Barberini (nephew of Pope Urban VIII), was waiting for the Infanta to give her the Golden Rose. The cortege moved to Naples, where Maria Anna finally received the award. Leaving the Kingdom of Naples, the Infanta crossed the Papal States, having made a pilgrimage to the Basilica della Santa Casa. On this <b>section</b> <b>of</b> her <b>journey</b> Maria Anna was accompanied by Roman aristocracy, led by another nephew of Pope Urban VIII, Taddeo Barberini, Prince of Palestrina. On 26 January 1631 she arrived in Trieste, where she met Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, her future brother-in-law, who escort the Infanta to the Vienna court. That day, Maria Anna was married to King Ferdinand of Hungria-Bohemia per procura with Archduke Leopold Wilhelm serving as the proxy.|$|R
50|$|Leaving the {{platforms}} at , {{the first}} sight {{to be seen}} from the train is the old goods yard. This is situated on the right-hand side of the running lines. This first <b>section</b> <b>of</b> the <b>journey</b> is located on a climbing gradient which continues until the train is clear of the station limits. Near the goods yard, passengers can see the Station House (now a private residence). Approaching the signal box, the train passes the steam locomotive and carriage shed. The signal box, situated on the left of the train, is passed shortly, and once the driver has received the single line token, the train may proceed into the section. The signal box is the oldest Midland Railway Co. type one box still in operational use. Once past the shed the steam locomotive yard is in view, with the inspection pit and preparation area. Continuing further up the gradient, the train shortly passes the railway's DMU siding on which are usually stored the 2-car 'hybrid' set and the Bubblecar.|$|R
