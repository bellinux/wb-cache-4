5|$|Half-Life 2 {{picks up}} the story, in which the G-Man takes Freeman out of stasis and inserts him on a train en route to City 17 an {{indeterminate}} number of years after {{the events of the}} first game, with Earth now enslaved by the transhuman forces of the Combine. The player guides Gordon to aid in humanity's struggle against the Combine and its human representative, Dr. Wallace Breen. He oversees the occupation from his base of operations in the Citadel, a monolithic building at the heart of City17. Fighting alongside Gordon is an underground resistance led by former colleague Dr. Eli Vance, as well other allies including Dr. Vance's daughter Alyx Vance and the enigmatic Vortigaunts, an alien species. Half-Life 2 ends with a climactic battle atop the Citadel that inflicts critical damage to its dark fusion reactor. <b>When</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> as if Alyx and Gordon are to be engulfed by the explosion, the G-Man appears once more. After giving a cryptic speech, he extracts Gordon from danger and places him in stasis once again.|$|E
5|$|Nietzsche {{rejected}} fundamental {{components of}} Kant's ethics, particularly his argument that morality, God, and immorality, {{can be shown}} through reason. Nietzsche cast suspicion {{on the use of}} moral intuition, which Kant used as the foundation of his morality, arguing that it has no normative force in ethics. He further attempted to undermine key concepts in Kant's moral psychology, such as the will and pure reason. Like Kant, Nietzsche developed a concept of autonomy; however, he rejected Kant's idea that valuing our own autonomy requires us to respect the autonomy of others. A naturalist reading of Nietzsche's moral psychology stands contrary to Kant's conception of reason and desire. Under the Kantian model, reason is a fundamentally different motive to desire because it has the capacity to stand back from a situation and make an independent decision. Nietzsche conceives of the self as a social structure of all our different drives and motivations; thus, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> that our intellect has made a decision against our drives, it is actually just an alternative drive taking dominance over another. This is in direct contrast with Kant's view of the intellect as opposed to instinct; instead, it is just another instinct. There is thus no self-capable of standing back and making a decision; the decision the self-makes is simply determined by the strongest drive. Kantian commentators have argued that Nietzsche's practical philosophy requires the existence of a self-capable of standing back in the Kantian sense. For an individual to create values of their own, which is a key idea in Nietzsche's philosophy, they must be able to conceive of themselves as a unified agent. Even if the agent is influenced by their drives, he must regard them as his own, which undermines Nietzsche's conception of autonomy.|$|E

25|$|The {{argument}} from simplicity {{is probably the}} simplest and also {{the most common form}} of argument against dualism of the mental. The dualist is always faced with the question of why anyone should find it necessary to believe in the existence of two, ontologically distinct, entities (mind and brain), <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> possible and would make for a simpler thesis to test against scientific evidence, to explain the same events and properties in terms of one. It is a heuristic principle in science and philosophy not to assume the existence of more entities than is necessary for clear explanation and prediction (see Occam's razor).|$|E
25|$|The Green Goblin {{sits at a}} piano {{at the top of}} the Chrysler Building and humorously boasts to the {{audience}} of his plan to destroy New York City ("I'll Take Manhattan"). Spider-Man arrives ready to fight, but is soon unmasked when the Goblin reveals he knows Spider-Man's true identity. Peter attempts to revive the good-natured Norman within the Goblin, but to no avail. Peter engages the Goblin in combat, but before he can finish him the Goblin reveals that he has Mary Jane, who now dangles from the Chrysler Building. A flying battle over {{the audience}} takes place and <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> all hope is lost, Spider-Man webs the Green Goblin to his piano. The Green Goblin, not realizing this, thrusts the piano over the side of the Chrysler Building, taking him down to his death. After Spider-Man saves Mary Jane, she tells him not to leave and reveals that she has guessed who he is. Peter removes his mask and they embrace. The two contemplate their new life together before sirens begin wailing and Spider-Man swings away ("Finale: A New Dawn").|$|E

500|$|Grey's {{has also}} been {{credited}} to have changed the perception on how good and bad television can be defined, The A.V. Club write, [...] "Since The Sopranos burst onto the scene, we’ve too often classified a show as [...] "good" [...] based on how closely it adhered to the dark, violent, male-centric template set out by that particular show. It’s time for that to end. At its best, Grey’s {{has been among the}} very best shows on TV, and at its worst, it’s been at least fascinating to watch. To write it off is to unnecessarily narrow the definition of what good TV can be, to limit what the medium is capable of. TV is at its best when it emotionally connects, and even <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> to be otherwise merrily hurtling off a cliff, Grey’s Anatomy is nothing but emotional connection, which is more than other, more consistently better shows can say." ...|$|E
500|$|Don and Roger Sterling (John Slattery) {{meet with}} Rachel Menken (Maggie Siff), the Jewish {{owner of a}} large {{department}} store. Roger, feeling uncomfortable due to the novelty of having a Jewish client, enlists the only Jewish person in the company, {{a young man who}} works in the mailroom, to attend the meeting, disguised {{as a member of the}} art department, in order to make Rachel feel comfortable. Rachel, looking to attract wealthier customers, is disappointed by the agency's suggestions of coupons to attract frugal housewives. The meeting becomes heated, with Don angry that a woman would talk to him in such a commanding way, and Rachel angry that the men will not respect her bold plans for the family business. A later meeting with executives from Lucky Strike tobacco company also appears to go badly, as Don still struggles to find a new approach to cigarette advertising. Pete suggests the [...] "death wish" [...] idea put forth by the company's research, but the executives reject his idea. Just <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> that the meeting is over, Don comes up with a new tagline—"It's toasted!"—along with a strategy that ignores the question of health risks while extolling the virtues of the supposedly unique way that Lucky Strikes are prepared. The client is impressed, but Don is furious at Pete for literally fishing through Don's trash can to uncover and revive something Don had explicitly rejected.|$|E
500|$|Grey's Anatomy {{has been}} well {{received}} among critics. The show holds an average of 71% positive score on Rotten Tomatoes and 7.7/10 score at IMDB site. The A.V. Club gave an insight on both the overwhelming success and lows {{in the quality of}} the hit medical drama saying, [...] "The quality arc for the show is all over the place, starting with a steady build in the first season, then skyrocketing into phenomenon in season two, then leveling off and dipping in season three, before having some seriously bumpy moments in seasons four (interrupted by the writers’ strike) and five. The climb begins again in season six" [...] Samantha Highfill of Entertainment Weekly in a review wrote, [...] " [...] I believe the show’s best season to date is season 2. Let me make it clear that I’m not saying seasons 3 through 9 were bad. In my opinion, there have only been a few lulls in the show’s history, and most of them didn’t last a full season." [...] adding, [...] "I still enjoy the show, and I’ll honestly never stop watching. By any standards, Grey’s Anatomy has been successful television, ranking highly in the ratings for nine seasons and entering the cultural lexicon via phrases as cloying yet catchy as [...] "McDreamy.", the show has had its periods of being intensely irritating, and it has had its periods <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> as if Shonda Rhimes has taken leave of her faculties, but it’s also got an amazingly high batting average, particularly with every solid season that passes along in this second act of its run." [...] The site lauded the show saying, [...] "On average, it’s been very good TV, filled with interesting, driven characters who run the gamut of professions within the show’s hospital setting. It’s been, by turns, a good soap, a good romantic comedy, a good medical drama, and a good interpersonal show about an unexpected workplace family." ...|$|E

The military used its newly expansive powers, demanding changes in the civilian government and abusing Honduran citizens with impunity. PLH leader Francisco Milla Bermúdez argued that Honduras should abolish its military completely, as Costa Rica had done. Resentment against the military was rising, and Milla Bermúdez's proposal received unexpected popular support.|$|E
2500|$|Plato's Problem is {{the term}} given by Noam Chomsky to [...] "the problem of {{explaining}} how we can know so much" [...] given our limited experience. Chomsky believes that Plato asked (using modern terms) how we should account for the rich, intrinsic, common structure of human cognition, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>seems</b> undetermined by extrinsic evidence presented to a person during human development. In linguistics this {{is referred to as}} the [...] "argument from poverty of the stimulus" [...] (APS). Such arguments are common in the natural sciences, where a developing theory is always [...] "underdetermined by evidence". Chomsky's approach to Plato's Problem involves treating cognition as a normal research topic in the natural sciences, so cognition can be studied to elucidate intertwined genetic, developmental, and biophysical factors. Plato's Problem is most clearly illustrated in the Meno dialogue, in which Socrates demonstrates that an uneducated boy nevertheless understands geometric principles.|$|E

While their first season together passed without incident, the second did not end well. During the 2003 Pontiac Excitement 400, Harvick ran into the rear of Green's car while Green was attempting to avoid a conflict between Ryan Newman and Ward Burton. Harvick began apologizing for the spin-out, and cameras showed that Green's car had hesitated before the collision.
