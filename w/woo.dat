5|$|After the {{financial}} backing from Tsui Hark became problematic following {{the release of}} Woo's film A Better Tomorrow 2, <b>Woo</b> had to find backing through Chow Yun Fat's and Danny Lee's financing companies. <b>Woo</b> went into filming The Killer with a rough draft whose plot {{was influenced by the}} films Le Samouraï, Mean Streets, and Narazumono. <b>Woo</b> desired to make a film about honour, friendship and the relationship of two seemingly opposite people. After finishing filming, <b>Woo</b> referred to The Killer as a tribute to directors Jean-Pierre Melville and Martin Scorsese.|$|E
5|$|Hard Target was Woo's first American {{film and}} {{was also the first}} major Hollywood film made by a Chinese {{director}}. Universal Pictures was nervous about having <b>Woo</b> direct a feature, and sent in director Sam Raimi to look over the film's production and to take Woo's place as director if he were to fail. <b>Woo</b> went through several scripts finding mostly martial arts films with which he was not interested. After deciding on Chuck Pfarrer's script for Hard Target, <b>Woo</b> wanted to have actor Kurt Russell in the lead role, but found Russell too busy with other projects. <b>Woo</b> then went with Universal's initial choice of having Jean-Claude Van Damme star. <b>Woo</b> got along with Van Damme during filming and raised the amount of action in the film as he knew that Van Damme was up for it.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{originally}} developed in 1990. After creating films {{which focused on}} the lives of gangsters, director John <b>Woo</b> wanted to make a film that glorified the police instead. <b>Woo</b> admired Clint Eastwood's and Steve McQueen's characters from their films Dirty Harry and Bullitt respectively, and wanted to make his own Hong Kong-style Dirty Harry police detective film. While creating this character, <b>Woo</b> was inspired by a police officer who was a strong-willed and tough member of the police force, as well as being an avid drummer. This led to <b>Woo</b> having Tequila's character be a musician as well as a cop.|$|E

5|$|The script of {{the film}} went through several changes during filming. Due to the length {{of the film}}, scenes from a side-story {{involving}} the relationship between the character Tequila and Teresa Chang were cut. Another cut scene included Tequila playing clarinet over Benny's grave. With these cuts, Chow Yun-Fat felt his character was not very deep in comparison to Leung's character of Alan. To develop his character more, Chow asked John <b>Woo</b> to insert a mentor character in the film, which <b>Woo</b> himself would play. Chow felt that having <b>Woo</b> in this role would make <b>Woo</b> not cut out these scenes. Philip Kwok's role of Mad Dog was not in the script and was created on the set. Kwok first worked with <b>Woo</b> on his film Once a Thief and was asked to return to work on Hard Boiled. After reading the script, <b>Woo</b> felt that the character of Johnny Wong was not a strong enough physical threat. After seeing Kwok do several of the stunts while filming, <b>Woo</b> created the character of Mad Dog for him.|$|E
5|$|<b>Woo</b> {{had over}} 90 days to shoot The Killer which was {{nearly double the}} amount of time that the average Hong Kong film was shot in the late 1980s. <b>Woo</b> went into filming with only a short {{treatment}} for the film and wrote the details of the script while filming. During promotion periods for the film, <b>Woo</b> described the film as a tribute to Martin Scorsese and French director Jean-Pierre Melville. <b>Woo</b> cites Melville's Le Samouraï as an influence on the story. <b>Woo</b> borrows plot elements for the film, including the set-up where Jef enters a nightclub and looks at the female singer. <b>Woo</b> also described the influence of a Japanese film, Narazumono, about a killer (Ken Takakura) who only kills delinquents. When a mob tricks him into killing an innocent person, he swears revenge but then meets a woman who has tuberculosis and wants to go home. The killer promises the woman that he will take her home after getting his revenge.|$|E
5|$|After 65 days of filming in New Orleans, <b>Woo</b> {{had trouble}} with the Motion Picture Association of America to secure the R rating that Universal wanted. <b>Woo</b> made dozens of cuts to the film until the MPAA allowed it an R rating. On its initial release, Hard Target was a {{financial}} success but received mixed reviews from film critics.|$|E

5|$|The Killer was {{director}} Woo's follow-up to A Better Tomorrow 2 which {{was released in}} 1987. The first cut of A Better Tomorrow 2 was too long for the studio so the film was edited within a week separately by both producer Tsui Hark and <b>Woo.</b> According to producer Terence Chang, Tsui Hark felt that John <b>Woo</b> ruined A Better Tomorrow 2 and asked Chang to fire <b>Woo</b> from the studio. When Chang refused, Hark began rejecting Woo's new film ideas, including ideas for films that would later be made, such as Bullet in the Head and Once a Thief.|$|E
50|$|As a producer, Tsui Hark {{facilitated}} {{the creation of}} John <b>Woo's</b> epoch-making heroic bloodshed movie A Better Tomorrow (1986). <b>Woo's</b> saga of cops and the triads (Chinese gangsters) combined fancifully choreographed (and extremely violent) gunplay with heightened emotional melodrama, sometimes resembling a modern-dress version of 1970s kung fu films by <b>Woo's</b> mentor Chang Cheh. The formula broke another all-time box office record. It also jump-started the faltering career of co-star Chow Yun-fat, who overnight {{became one of the}} colony's most popular idols and <b>Woo's</b> favorite leading man.|$|R

5|$|Hard Boiled was John Woo's last Hong Kong film {{before his}} {{transition}} to Hollywood. After making films that glamorized gangsters (and receiving criticism for doing so), <b>Woo</b> {{wanted to make}} a Dirty Harry styled film to glamorize the police. After the death of screenwriter Barry Wong, the film's screenplay underwent constant changes during filming. New characters such as Mad Dog and Mr. <b>Woo</b> were introduced, while the original plotline of a baby poisoning psychopath was cut.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Jeong <b>Woo's</b> boss devises a {{much tougher}} plan to catch Jeong <b>Woo's</b> assassin by {{targeting}} {{himself for a}} contract killing. A series of events leads Hye-young to realise that Park Yi was the one sending her the daisies. Park Yi, who is all set to assassinate Jeong <b>Woo's</b> boss, is taken by surprise when Hye-young shows up asking him to stop. The assassin responsible for Jeong <b>Woo's</b> death shoots at Park Yi, but the bullet is intercepted by Hye-young, who sees {{the reflection of the}} car that the assassin is in on a building opposite, and she dies.|$|R

5|$|<b>Woo</b> {{draws on}} animal {{symbolism}} throughout the film. He filled {{the church with}} doves and pigeons, employing doves to represent {{the spirits of the}} people. This was the first film where <b>Woo</b> used the dove symbolism and he has used it to similar effect in Hard Target and Face/Off. A cat appears when Ah Jong first meets Jennie on her visit home, and secondarily when Li's partner Tsang tries to catch Ah Jong in Jennie's apartment. In Chinese culture, a cat coming into a home is an omen of ruin and poverty for its inhabitants. Both Tsang and Jennie meet negative outcomes in the film.|$|E
5|$|On 3 Oct 2000 Fox Lorber {{released}} a DVD of The Killer with English and Cantonese audio, including a commentary track with John <b>Woo</b> and film trailers.

5|$|The Killer was {{not able}} to be filmed until actor Chow Yun-fat stepped in and enlisted the company he was {{contracted}} with, Golden Princess Film, to fund part of the project. Chow had worked previously with <b>Woo</b> on the two A Better Tomorrow films. <b>Woo</b> wanted Danny Lee to play Li Ying, but Lee was under an exclusive contract with Cinema City and was only able to work on The Killer if his production company, Magnum, was involved. John <b>Woo</b> approached his friend, Sally Yeh, asking her to be in a film to play an important female character. Yeh was currently contracted with Tsui Hark and accepted the role but later felt she did not give her best performance. The supporting roles were filled out by friends of the actors and director. Chu Kong was a friend of Chow Yun-fat who had entered retirement and returned to acting in The Killer as a favor. Two of Woo's close friends joined the cast: actor Kenneth Tsang and screenwriter Barry Wong. Wong Wing-Hang was hired to be the director of photography for The Killer but had to leave the set {{for an extended period of}} time, so Peter Pau was added to shoot the rest of the film.|$|E
