25|$|Six of the escapees {{were there}} and <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> about three hours with me trying to persuade them to come back. They {{told me that they}} had {{sent a letter to the}} Minister of Justice Bakoa Kaltongga, {{complaining}} that they had been at ‘Container City’ since June in very confined areas, not allowed visitation rights and had no chance to see their chiefs for rehabilitation.|$|E
2500|$|Emily: [...] "The {{stakes were}} {{definitely}} higher on that song. We {{knew it was}} special {{because it was so}} autobiographical, and we had to get it right. We've all gone through so many emotions about the incident. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> days with Dan before putting pen to paper, and he really helped get inside our heads and put these feelings out. And once we had this song done, it freed us up to do the rest of the album without that burden." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jack Valenti {{identifies}} {{the film as}} the first controversial movie he {{had to deal with}} as president of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). [...] The movie was the first to use the word [...] "screw" [...] and the phrase [...] "hump the hostess" [...] on screen. [...] As he says, [...] "In company with the MPAA's general counsel, Louis Nizer, I met with Jack Warner, the legendary chieftain of Warner Bros., and his top aide, Ben Kalmenson. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> three hours, and the result was deletion of 'screw' and retention of 'hump the hostess', but I was uneasy over the meeting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With the Servian Minister's wife. I shall excuse myself early. It {{is a vital}} {{necessity}} that <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>for</b> a {{few minutes}} before you leave here. Five minutes ago I sent a note to your rooms." ...|$|R
60|$|In the drawing-room <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>for</b> {{a time of}} {{ordinary}} matters--of the allowances one must make for a child like Maurice, for instance--and gradually we drift {{to the subject of}} literature. I know literary people sufficiently well to be aware that they will talk freely--almost too freely--of their work if approached in the proper spirit.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>talked</b> along <b>for</b> half an hour, {{and then}} I {{noticed that he}} looked tired, and spoke of it.|$|R
2500|$|Over the years, {{there were}} several reunion rumors, and on 2 October 2003 it was made official: Europe {{announced}} {{plans for a new}} album and world tour. The band then switched back to the Final Countdown line-up, with John Norum as the only lead guitarist. [...] "There was no doubt that we wanted John back, and John wanted to get back," [...] Tempest said, [...] "For me it was important to get that spark going again that we had before." [...] Kee Marcello claimed that he was too busy with his own projects. [...] "I told them I didn't want to participate in a [...] studio album because musically, I want to go in a different kind of direction than the music Europe stands for," [...] Marcello said, [...] "Then <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> a while about doing a six-piece tour – it didn't turn out that way because of different reasons." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{converted}} to Orthodoxy and became Grand Duchess Maria Feodorovna of Russia. The lavish wedding {{took place on}} [...] in the Imperial Chapel of the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg. Financial constraints had prevented her parents from attending the wedding, and in their stead, they sent her brother, Crown Prince Frederick. Her brother-in-law, the Prince of Wales, had also travelled to Saint Petersburg for the ceremony; pregnancy had prevented the Princess of Wales from attending. After the wedding night, Alexander wrote in his diary, [...] "I took off my slippers and my silver embroidered robe and felt the body of my beloved next to mine... How I felt then, I {{do not wish to}} describe here. Afterwards <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> a long time." [...] After the many wedding parties were over the newlyweds moved into the Anichkov Palace in Saint Petersburg where they were to live for the next 15 years, when they were not taking extended holidays at their summer villa Livadia in the Crimean Peninsula.|$|E
2500|$|It was a {{very hard}} {{thing for me to}} do because I liked him but I really felt what he did was awful and that unless I felt myself if I didn’t say something, I’d be a hypocrite. I also felt that if {{somebody}} who was supportive of him didn’t say something, it would not be good. And so it got a lot of attention. I got a call from Erskine Bowles who was Chief of Staff about three or four days later saying {{that he was going to}} express an opinion which wasn’t universally held at the White House– he thought I helped the president by bursting the boil, that was the metaphor he used. The following Sunday morning, I'm at home and the phone rings, it’s the White House. And it’s now about a week and a couple of days since I made the speech. The president says, it was the president, [...] "I just want you to know that there’s nothing you said in that speech that I don’t agree with. And I want you to know that I’m working on it." [...] And <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> about forty-five minutes. It was amazing.|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{food was}} eaten thirty seasons ago," [...] said the Adjutant quietly. [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>for</b> thirty seasons more {{it will never}} come back. Tell us, now, what {{happened}} when the good waters were reached after thy most wonderful land journey. If we listened to the howling of every jackal {{the business of the}} town would stop, as the saying is." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>talked</b> {{together}} <b>for</b> some minutes longer, and then, apparently hearing {{something in}} the house which I did not notice, she rose rather abruptly.|$|R
60|$|After this <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> {{together}} <b>for</b> a long while, {{for with}} pockets as empty as mine were then, the problem seemed difficult, if not insoluble.|$|R
2500|$|When Narayanan {{returned}} to India in 1948, Laski {{gave him a}} letter of introduction to Prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. Years later, he narrated how {{he began his career}} in the public service:When I finished with LSE, Laski, of his own, gave me a letter of introduction for Panditji. On reaching Delhi I sought an appointment with the PM. I suppose, because I was an Indian student returning home from London, I was given a time-slot. It was here in Parliament House that he met me. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> a few minutes about London and things like that and I could soon see {{that it was time for}} me to leave. So I said goodbye and as I left the room I handed over the letter from Laski, and stepped out into the great circular corridor outside. When I was half way round, I heard the sound of someone clapping from the direction I had just come. I turned to see Panditji [...] beckoning me to come back. He had opened the letter as I left his room and read it. [...] "Why didn't you give this to me earlier?" [...] "Well, sir, I am sorry. I thought it would be enough if I just handed it over while leaving." [...] After a few more questions, he asked me to see him again and very soon I found myself entering the Indian Foreign Service.|$|E
60|$|So <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> a while of Italy. They had a pained {{tenderness}} for it, sad, reserved.|$|E

60|$|Umslopogaas smiled grimly, {{for he had}} a {{sense of}} humour and could {{appreciate}} a repartee even when it hit him hard. Then <b>we</b> stopped <b>talking</b> <b>for</b> the climb took all our breath.|$|R

6000|$|... "We got chatting about you, my ownest," [...] said Marmaduke; [...] "and {{the subject}} was so sweet, and the moments were so fleet, that <b>we</b> <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> quite {{an hour on the}} strict q.t. Eh, Marian?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Naturally. I {{asked her}} for a week, and I think she means to stay. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> an hour after tea this afternoon, and I found her most interesting. She {{has been living in}} England for years, it seems, down in Chelsea, {{studying}} sculpture." ...|$|E
60|$|Willersley theorised while I {{thought of}} the woman and that provocative quality of dash she had displayed. The next day at lunch she and I met like old friends. A huge mass of private {{thinking}} during the interval had been added to our effect upon one another. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> a time of insignificant things.|$|E
3000|$|I do {{not think}} there's too many players. Even {{sometimes}} {{we would like to}} include more people, <b>for</b> example <b>we</b> have <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> years about getting patients involved in the decision-making process. (HA- 15) [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all alike. It's {{your way}} with us. All of you. There isn't {{a man in}} the world deserves to have a woman in the world. We do all we can for you. We do all we can to amuse you, we dress <b>for</b> you and <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>for</b> you. All the sweet, warm little women there are! And then you go away from us! There never was a woman yet who pleased and {{satisfied}} a man, who did not lose him. Give you everything and off you must go! Lovers, mothers...." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] she exclaimed, [...] "you {{must not}} try to, what you say, pump me! You {{can call it}} what you will. Only to Louise, as to me, it is very much a {{personal}} affair. Shall <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> now, <b>for</b> a little, of other things?" ...|$|R
60|$|I didn't {{feel like}} facing the ci-devant Scarabelli at that moment; so I said that I {{was leaving the}} house, but that I would do myself the honour of calling upon his wife. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> a minute of {{something}} else, and then, suddenly breaking off and looking at me, he laid {{his hand on my}} arm. I must do him the justice to say that he looks felicitous.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> {{some time}} upon quite {{ordinary}} subjects. As the time passed on, however, {{and her father}} did not return, {{it seemed to me}} she became more silent. She told me very little about herself and the few personal things she said were always restrained. I was beginning to feel almost discouraged; she sat so long with a slight frown upon her forehead and her head turned away from me.|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> {{a time of}} mountains, I still {{standing}} a little aloof until my coffee came. Miss Summersley Satchel produced that frequent and most unpleasant bye-product of a British education, an intelligent interest in etymology. [...] "I wonder," [...] she said, with a brow of ruffled omniscience and eyeing me rather severely with a magnified eye, [...] "why it is called Titlis. There must be some reason...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Monsieur," [...] she said, [...] "do not, I beg of you, be rash. It {{was foolish}} of me, perhaps, {{to meet you}} here. <b>We</b> can <b>talk</b> <b>for</b> a few minutes, and afterwards, perhaps, we may meet again, but I am frightened all the time." ...|$|R
60|$|The paradox lies in wait here, as in {{most other}} human affairs, to {{confound}} us, {{and we try to}} baffle it, in this way and in that. <b>We</b> <b>talk,</b> <b>for</b> instance, of poetry for poets, and we fondly imagine that this is different from <b>talking</b> of cookery <b>for</b> cooks. Poetry is not made for poets; they have enough poetry of their own, but it is made for people who are not poets. If it does not please these, it may still be poetry, but it is poetry which has failed of its truest office. It is none the less its truest office because some very wretched verse seems often to do it.|$|R
5000|$|... "We {{have a good}} relationship, we don't fret if <b>we</b> don't <b>talk</b> <b>for</b> a month. The filming {{ended last}} May, and we've seen each other {{two or three times}} since then. We get on the phone and it's as if we've not been out of touch at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{glanced at}} the letter--interrogatively, and he gravely {{picked it up and}} put it into his pocket. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> a while longer, but I saw that he had {{suddenly}} become preoccupied; that he was apparently weighing an impulse to break some last barrier of reserve. At last he suddenly laid his hand on my arm, looked at me a moment appealingly, and cried, [...] "Upon my word, I should like to tell you everything!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought at}} first," [...] {{explained}} Jack Herring, recounting the incident {{later in the}} evening, [...] "that I must be dreaming. There he sat, drinking his five o'clock whisky-and-soda, the same Joey Loveredge I had known for fifteen years; yet not the same. Not a feature altered, not a hair on his head changed, yet the whole face was different; the same body, the same clothes, but another man. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> half an hour; he remembered everything that Joey Loveredge had known. I couldn't understand it. Then, as the clock struck, and he rose, saying he must be home at half- past five, the explanation suddenly occurred to me: Joey Loveredge was dead; this was a married man." ...|$|E
60|$|In his random reading he {{had never}} chanced upon the Rubáiyát, and it was to him like a great find of treasure. Much I remembered, {{possibly}} two-thirds of the quatrains, and I managed to piece out the remainder without difficulty. <b>We</b> <b>talked</b> <b>for</b> hours over single stanzas, and I found him reading into them a wail of regret and a rebellion which, {{for the life of}} me, I could not discover myself. Possibly I recited with a certain joyous lilt which was my own, for—his memory was good, and at a second rendering, very often the first, he made a quatrain his own—he recited the same lines and invested them with an unrest and passionate revolt that was well-nigh convincing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, by {{the special}} mercy of Providence Severall is a rank Radical, and I am a good stiff Unionist, and <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> Home Rule <b>for</b> two solid hours every evening." ...|$|R
5000|$|In March 2011, United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon reported, [...] "The {{negotiations}} {{cannot be}} an open-ended process, nor can <b>we</b> afford interminable <b>talks</b> <b>for</b> {{the sake of}} talks".|$|R
60|$|Then <b>we</b> fell to <b>talking</b> <b>for</b> {{at least}} the tenth time of how the work of {{destruction}} would be accomplished, and while we were thus engaged Darius came alongside.|$|R
