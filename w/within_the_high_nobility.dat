As these events unfold, the T-Energy goes increasingly out of control and changes into a destructive force that mutates creatures, destroys cities, and renders entire regions uninhabitable. The campaign selection you make will determine whether your story involves healing the land, or intensifying the chaos.|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decades {{of the fifteenth century}} and {{the first decades of the}} sixteenth, a {{permanent}} and violent struggle for hegemony took place in the region of Rioja between three families of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>nobility</b> –the Manrique, <b>the</b> Arellano and the Velasco. This indicates that King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella´s success in pacifying the kingdom and in the political subjection of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>nobility</b> was very limited. To provide a more detailed demonstration of this thesis, this article analyses the strategies employed by these three lineages of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>nobility</b> to increase their power in Rioja where they possessed their seigneurial estates.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to examine whether the second war of {{independence}} from 1332 - 41 was a ‘national’ war or simply a series of regional conflicts. Three separate but overlapping influences are examined: national identity, {{the extent to which}} the different regions of Scotland were drawn in, and the landed interests involved in each region. These three issues are considered for the first time using a prosophographical approach, examining the background and actions of the key players in <b>the</b> conflict, <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>nobility</b> of Scotland. <b>The</b> thesis examines, first of all, the role of <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>nobility</b> of Scotland in the 1330 s. It then looks at each of the recognisable regions of the country in turn, considering who the key members of <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>nobility</b> were in each region, what their interests were and to what extent they were involved in the region. Finally it looks at the motivations of these individuals, primarily from the perspective of national identity, or perhaps more accurately, regnal solidarity. Its conclusion is that the second war of independence was indeed a national war, centred as it was on the interests of the kingdom as a national entity but that other factors – the legitimacy of the Bruce and Balliol claims, the influence of family allegiances through marriage, the personal safety of the members of <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>nobility,</b> <b>the</b> threat of forfeiture and their personal ambitions - were also at work...|$|R
