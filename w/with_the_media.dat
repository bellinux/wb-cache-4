5|$|After being released, JJ terminates his {{contract}} with Dhingra's company, embarks on a country-wide tour for his concerts and finally morphs fully into 'Jordan' - the true rockstar, which he {{had always wanted to}} be. He turns into a bitter, arrogant, and lonely man after finding that the fame does not fill the void in his life. Khatana is now his manager, but fails to control him, and Jordan is constantly involved in fights <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> and fans. Inspite of all this, he remains a highly popular artist.|$|E

5|$|Bamber first sought {{leave to}} appeal in November 1986, arguing that the judge had {{misdirected}} the jury. The application was heard and refused by a single judge in April 1988. Bamber's lawyer requested a full hearing before three judges, arguing that the trial judge's summing up had been biased against Bamber, that his language had been too forceful, {{and that he had}} undermined the defence by advancing his own theory. The lawyer also argued that the defence had not pressed Julie Mugford about her dealings <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>media,</b> but should have, because as soon as the trial was over her story began to appear in newspapers. The judges rejected the application in March 1989.|$|E
5|$|He was {{inducted}} into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1975. Russell, who had a difficult relationship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>media,</b> did not attend either event. After retiring as a player, Russell had stints as head coach of the Seattle SuperSonics (1973 to 1977) and Sacramento Kings (1987 to 1988). His time as a non-player coach was lackluster; although he led the struggling SuperSonics into the playoffs {{for the first time in}} franchise history, Russell's defensive, team-oriented Celtics mindset did not mesh well with the team, and he left in 1977 with a 162–166 record. Russell's stint with the Kings was considerably shorter, his last assignment ending when the Kings went 17–41 to begin the 1987–88 season.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, Peter Mandelson was {{appointed}} as the Labour Party's director of communication; previously, {{he had worked}} in television broadcasting. He helped the party become increasingly effective at communication and more concerned with its media image, especially with non-partisans. Mandelson headed the Campaigns and Communications Directorate, established in 1985, and initiated the Shadow Communications Agency. He oversaw Labour's relationship <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> and believed {{in the importance of}} the agenda-setting role of the press. He felt that the agenda of the press (broadsheets in particular) would influence important political broadcasters. In government, Mandelson {{was appointed}} minister without portfolio to co-ordinate the various government departments. In 1998, accused of financial impropriety, he resigned as a cabinet minister.|$|E
5|$|In July 1999, the Communist Party {{initiated}} {{a campaign to}} persecute Falun Gong, including {{through the use of}} extralegal imprisonment, torture and other coercive measures, and propaganda. Falun Gong communities inside and outside China have adopted a variety of approaches to resist and mitigate the persecution in China. These tactics range from engagement <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>media,</b> lobbying of governments and NGOs, public protests and demonstrations, and attempts to seek legal redress. As the persecution in China progressed, overseas Falun Gong efforts increasingly tied their pleas for relief to Western human rights discourse, emphasizing the implications for freedom of speech, assembly, and conscience.|$|E

5|$|Tracy {{left the}} family home in 1933, and he and Louise openly {{discussed}} the separation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>media,</b> maintaining {{that they were still}} friends and had not taken divorce action. From September 1933 to June 1934, Tracy had a public affair with Loretta Young, his co-star in Man's Castle. He reconciled with Louise in 1935. There was never again an official separation between Tracy and his wife, but the marriage continued to be troubled. Tracy increasingly lived in hotels and by the 1940s, the two were effectively living separate lives. Tracy frequently engaged in extramarital affairs, including with co-stars Joan Crawford in 1937 and Ingrid Bergman in 1941.|$|E
5|$|A {{television}} {{broadcast of the}} concert, titled Madonna: The MDNA Tour, aired on Epix in the United States on June 22, 2013. The concert premiered at 8 p.m. EST on Epix's TV network and online at EpixHD.com and on Epix apps. On June 18, the concert special had a world premiere screening at The Paris Theater, in New York City, with Madonna attending the event {{in a press conference}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>media,</b> celebrities, and fans. A contest was released just for US residents, who had the chance to win two invitations for the special event. The singer wore a black tuxedo and a top hat to the premiere, the ensemble being a tribute to actress Marlene Dietrich and her similar attire in the 1930 film, Morocco. During the Q, Madonna recalled how difficult it was to sometimes perform on the tour, but she and her troupe nevertheless did it. At the end of the session, she showed a trailer from her secretprojectrevolution film with photographer Steven Klein; the one-minute clip featured her background dancers and showed the singer being dragged on the floor. Other shots included Madonna wielding a gun, her dancers in underwear, and religious iconography.|$|E
5|$|From 1937 Burnet was {{involved}} in a variety of scientific and public policy bodies, starting with a position on a government advisory council on polio. After he became the director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute in 1944, he was considered a public figure and overcame shyness to become a good public speaker. He recognised the importance of co-operation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> if the general public was to understand science and scientists, and his writings and lectures played an important part in the formulation of public attitudes and policy in Australia on a variety of biological topics. However, despite making many appearances on radio and television, he never became at ease with interviews and had to be selective with outreach engagements due to the many invitations he received, and tended to accept those that had the potential to promote the Institute. Over time, he began to increase his activism, as he felt more confident that {{he would be able to}} make an impact as his reputation grew, especially after winning the Nobel Prize, and even more so after his retirement from the directorship of the Institute. Although Burnet was not naturally outgoing, he saw it as the social responsibility of a scientific leader and scholar to publicly speak out and impart wisdom and foresight to the wider community.|$|E

5|$|In 1954, Takechi {{followed}} Susugigawa with a noh-kyōgen {{version of}} Junji Kinoshita's Yūzuru. Yūzuru {{is one of}} the most successful Japanese post-World War II plays, having received over a thousand performances at schools and theaters both within Japan and internationally since its debut in 1949. Composer Ikuma Dan wrote an opera version of the play in 1952. Since its premiere, Dan's opera has been performed more than 550 times, making it possibly the most popular opera written in Japanese. Dan was recruited to write the original music for Takechi's production of the play. Dan combined the noh-style solo vocal lines with a Western orchestra and chorus. On the same program as Yūzuru was another Takechi-directed kyōgen, Higashi wa Higashi (East is East), a parody of the kyōgen style. Among the innovations Takechi made in this play was the inclusion of a former Takarazuka actress in the usually all-male kyōgen cast. In the ultra-conservative noh and kyōgen communities, simply appearing in a rival school's production could result in an actor's excommunication from the profession. Because of the public attention drawn through Takechi's relentless publicity work and communication <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>media,</b> punitive actions against actors who worked with Takechi were avoided.|$|E
5|$|O'Sullivan {{returned}} to {{action at the}} Masters, to a mixed response from the audience (being both booed and clapped). He won his first round match 6–1 on 16 January 2007, against Ali Carter, making two century breaks in the process. However, he then created more controversy by failing to attend a post-match press conference. He did record a short interview with Steve Davis for the BBC, stating that he was much happier than at the UK Championship, {{and that he was}} playing well once again. Sir Rodney Walker later issued a statement declaring that O'Sullivan had been excused from dealing <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> because of the exceptional circumstances affecting him. This decision was criticised by Shaun Murphy. O'Sullivan {{went on to win the}} tournament against Ding Junhui, on 21 January 2007. In the match, he was noted for his good sportsmanship by Steve Davis, specifically for comforting Ding after the twelfth frame, during which Ding had become visibly upset by an overly partisan member of the crowd, who was later ejected. O'Sullivan was leading 9–3 at the time, and won the next frame for a 10–3 victory.|$|E
5|$|R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. Records in 1996 for a {{reported}} $80million (a figure the band constantly asserted originated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>media),</b> {{rumored to be}} the largest recording contract in history at that point. The group's 1996 album New Adventures in Hi-Fi debuted at number two in the US and number one in the UK. The five million copies of the album sold were a reversal of the group's commercial fortunes of the previous five years. Time writer Christopher John Farley argued that the lesser sales of the album were due to the declining commercial power of alternative rock as a whole. That same year, R.E.M. parted ways with manager Jefferson Holt, allegedly due to sexual harassment charges levied against him {{by a member of the}} band's home office in Athens. The group's lawyer Bertis Downs assumed managerial duties.|$|E

5|$|Roméo Dallaire, from October 1993 to August 1994, {{served as}} the Force Commander for the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda. In January 1994 he passed along {{information}} to the UN from a Hutu informant about a planned extermination of Tutsi citizens and a massacre of Belgian peacekeepers. After the UN denied him permission to protect the informant, or seize any weapons, Dallaire made a plea to the Canadian government who also denied him any assistance. Dallaire continued his pleas to the UN after the genocide began and devised a plans to end the violence. The UN ordered the peacekeepers to withdraw and not interfere. Dallaire, believing the order unethical and unlawful, disobeyed and with 450 Ghanaian soldiers, protected Tutsi hideouts. He received help from non-governmental organizations, foreign journalists, and the Canadian government. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> reporting on the massacre, the UN authorized 5,500 troops to protect civilians. Dallaire was denied permission to arrest fleeing Hutu leaders. In August Dallaire asked to be replaced after he recognized signs of posttraumatic stress disorder. Once back in Canada, he became appalled at how little the general public knew, and how much the world leaders knew, of what happened. In the aftermath, blame was assigned to various people, including Dallaire, but Off argues that blame lies with the UN and its Security Council who refused to act when called upon.|$|E
5|$|Since Yellowstone {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous {{national}} parks in the world, news coverage was extensive and sometimes sensational. Federal officials sometimes had only limited information to present to the media. The National Park Service received some 3,000 media requests, not all of which the two park public information officers were able to grant, even with the assistance of a staff of over 40 employees. 16 more park personnel were assigned the role of liaisons <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> where fire fighting manpower was concentrated. By the time the fires were under control in mid-November, the park was still receiving 40 to 70 media requests daily. Media coverage of the fires brought the National Park Service more national attention than it had ever received, and the 1988 fire season has been called one of the most important events in the history of that agency.|$|E
5|$|The National Basketball Association (NBA) All-Star Game is {{an annual}} {{exhibition}} basketball game played between the Eastern-Conference and the Western-Conference All-Stars. It {{is the main}} event of the NBA All-Star Weekend. Twelve players—five starters and seven s—from each conference are chosen {{from a pool of}} 120 players—60 players from each conference with 24 guards and 24 frontcourts (forwards and centers)—listed on the ballots by a panel of sport writers and broadcasters. The starters are chosen by a combination of fans, media, and current players. Fans may vote using a variety of online platforms, and account for 50% of the vote, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> and current players each accounting for 25%. The reserves are chosen by voting among the head coaches of each team's particular conference. Coaches are not allowed to vote for their own players, and can select two guards, three big men, and two players regardless of positions. If a player is unable to participate due to injury, the NBA commissioner will select a replacement. The 1999 All-Star Game was canceled due to the league's lockout.|$|E
