50|$|The United States has waived {{sovereign}} immunity {{to a limited}} extent, mainly through the Federal Tort Claims Act, which waives the immunity if a tortious act of a federal employee causes damage, and the Tucker Act, which waives the immunity over claims arising out of contracts to which {{the federal government is}} a party.

Part III addresses the development of case law interpreting the scope of government tort liability in light <b>of</b> the legislative <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> sovereign <b>immunity</b> and examines {{the impact of the}} remaining related common law immunities for executive, legislative, and judicial functions. Part III also examines the role of the 2 ̆ 2 public duty doctrine, 2 ̆ 2 which has evolved as a conceptual framework for assessing whether a predicate duty supports government tort liability in any given circumstance. Finally, Part IV exalts the continuing value of holding government accountable for its tortious conduct, treating such accountability as a legitimate means to encourage responsible government and achieve individual justice. Part IV also urges that any marked retreat from the broad <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> sovereign <b>immunity</b> is unnecessary and unjustified, whether viewed from a fiscal or ideological standpoint...|$|R

5000|$|The case {{turned on}} the grammar of part of the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), a 1946 law that waives {{sovereign}} immunity in some cases so {{that the federal government}} may be sued for certain torts. The FTCA states that the <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>immunity</b> does not apply to claims arising from the detention of property by [...] "any officer of customs or excise or any other law enforcement officer."

50|$|China has {{consistently}} claimed that a basic principle {{of international law}} is for states and their property to have absolute sovereign immunity. China objects to restrictive sovereign immunity. It is held that a state can waive its immunity by voluntarily stating so, but that should a government intervene in a suit (e.g. to make protests), {{it should not be}} viewed as <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>immunity.</b> Chinese state-owned companies considered instrumental to the state have claimed sovereign immunity in lawsuits brought against them in foreign courts before. China’s view is that sovereign immunity is a lawful right and interest that their enterprises are entitled to protect. Some examples of Chinese state-owned companies that have claimed sovereign immunity in foreign lawsuits are: the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and China National Building Material.|$|E

40|$|Embassy bank {{accounts}} {{are among the}} properties of statesmost widely presentin foreign states. Accordingly, they constitute an ideal target for attachment by creditors. International instruments have largely upheld state immunity from execution regarding {{bank accounts}}, however. Likewise, state practice largely – and apparently increasingly – supports state <b>immunity</b> from measures <b>of</b> attachment, by applying a presumption that funds in embassy bank accounts are used for governmental non-commercial purposes. This approach is overly deferential to the state. Instead, {{it is argued that}} domestic courts should require that the state, at least partially, discharge the burden of proof regarding the nature (commercial/sovereign) of the funds in the bank account. A failure to discharge this burden should result in a rejection <b>of</b> <b>immunity.</b> Only such an approach adequately balances the interests of states and creditors, and does sufficient justice to the creditor’s right of access to a court. In addition, it is argued that such a balance is also brought about by construing literally general <b>waivers</b> <b>of</b> <b>immunity</b> from attachment, as not requiring an additional specific waiver regarding embassy bank accounts...|$|R
5000|$|In Coyle v. P.T. Garuda Indonesia, Joyce Coyle filed a suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon {{against the}} Indonesian {{government}} subsidiary that operates Garuda Indonesia Airlines. Coyle alleged in her complaint that Garuda was liable for wrongful death under the Warsaw Convention. She also claimed that Garuda, which is wholly {{owned by the}} Indonesian government, could be held liable under two exceptions to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. She contended that because Garuda was authorized {{to operate in the}} United States at the time, the immunity had been explicitly waived under the rules of the Department of Transportation, which requires foreign air carriers to open themselves to suit in the United States as a condition of being allowed to fly to, from, or within this country. The waiver is limited to actions arising under treaties. Coyle also claimed that by selling tickets in the United States, Garuda waived immunity under the [...] "commercial activity" [...] exception to the FSIA. U.S. District Judge Robert E. Jones denied Garuda’s motion to dismiss, adopting a magistrate judge’s conclusion that the trip to Medan was [...] "one leg of an international journey" [...] and thus subject to the Warsaw Convention and the explicit <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>immunity.</b>|$|E

40|$|The article {{examines}} the jurisdictional immunity of international development banks (IDB’s) that have their seat in the United States of America. The terms of agreement of these institutions include a clause of <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>immunity</b> for any acts performed in the international financial markets. This broad waiver constitutes a special clause {{in regard to the}} general regime of immunity of international organizations, that grants protection for all acts performed in the exercise of their statutory functions. Before this legal background, this article analyzes the case-law of the U. S. courts when applying the waiver clauses of the IDB’s terms of agreement. The study of this case-law allows for affirming that U. S. courts do not interpret the clauses in accordance with relevant norms of treaty interpretation. Instead these courts follow strictly the restrictive criteria for <b>waiver</b> <b>of</b> <b>immunity</b> set forth by the Department of State, thus blurring the separation of powers between the executive and the judicial branches, {{while at the same time}} not applying with precision the IDB’s terms of agreement. The IDB’s, in turn, look with complacence to this interpretation by U. S. courts, because it shields them from claims by persons affected by their financial activitie...|$|E
