5|$|The {{summit of}} Mauna Kea lies above the tree line, and {{consists}} of mostly lava rock and alpine tundra. An area of heavy snowfall, it is inhospitable to vegetation, and {{is known as the}} Hawaiian tropical high shrublands. Growth is restricted here by extremely cold temperatures, a short growing season, low rainfall, and snow during winter months. A lack of soil also retards root growth, makes it difficult to absorb nutrients from the ground, and gives the area a very low <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> capacity.|$|E
5|$|Manufacturers and {{academics}} have conducted studies and experiments {{in an effort}} to improve the stretchiness, melting characteristics, browning, fat content and <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> of pizza cheese. Several patents exist for specialized varieties of pizza cheese and for its processing. A study by Rudan and Barbano found that the addition of a thin layer of vegetable oil atop low- and reduced-fat pizza cheese increased meltability and reduced browning and dehydration when the product was cooked, but the texture remained overly chewy and tough. A study by Perry et al. found various methods to heighten the melt of low-fat pizza cheese by increasing its moisture, including the use of pre-acidification, fat-replacers, and exopolysaccharide starter cultures as well as higher pasteurization temperatures.|$|E

5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may {{be treated as}} an agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, alfalfa and vetch. The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing. This can injure the roots and expose them to air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees. Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the gopher for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket gopher activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. Gopher activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration, enhancing <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also compost, enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits.|$|E

25|$|The depth, {{texture and}} {{composition}} of soils can influence its water retaining and draining ability. Soils containing large amounts of organic material tend to have the highest <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> abilities. These types of soils include deep loams, silty soils like what is typically found on the fertile valley floors {{such as in the}} California's Napa Valley. Clay particles have the potential to remain in colloidal suspension {{for long periods of time}} when it is dissolved in water. This gives clay-based soils the potential to retain significant amount of water such as the clay soils of the Right bank Bordeaux region of Pomerol. Many regions with these types of water retaining soils have little need for irrigation, or if they do it is usually supplemental during periods of drought. Soils with poor <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> include sand and alluvial gravel based soils such as those found in the Barolo and Barbaresco zones of Italy or in many areas of South Australia. Depending on the climate and amount of natural rainfall, areas with poor <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> may need irrigation.|$|E

25|$|A {{tailings}} dam is typically an earth-fill embankment dam used to store tailings, which are produced during mining operations after separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of an ore. Conventional <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> dams can serve this purpose, {{but due to}} cost, a {{tailings dam}} is more viable. Unlike <b>water</b> <b>retention</b> dams, a tailings dam is raised in succession throughout {{the life of the}} particular mine.

40|$|AbstractThe {{chemical}} modification method {{was used to}} improve the hydrophilicity of polyvinyl chloride-vinyl acetate copolymer (VC-co-VAc). The experimental {{results showed that the}} polymer material VC-co-VAc-OH can be obtained by hydroxy modification from VC-co-VAc. Then the polymer of VC-co-VAc-OH was used to prepare asymmetric flat-sheet membranes with the solvent of dimethyl acetamide (DMAc) and the additive of polyethylene glycol 20000 (PEG 20000) by using phase inversion technique. When the polymer concentration was 16 wt. %, mass ratio of solvent to additive was 10 : 1, coagulation temperature was 20, evaporation time was 30 s and relative humidity was 50 %, a membrane with good performance could be prepared. These results were supported by experimental data of pure <b>water</b> flux, <b>retention,</b> <b>water</b> content and pore size distribution...|$|R

40|$|There {{has become}} a growing demand {{for the use of}} {{manufactured}} topsoil for purposes of landscaping, predominantly in the construction industry. This coupled with a need to introduce organic matter into the china clay waste tip sand which litters the Cornish landscape in order to encourage a reversion back to the natural heathland landscape. It was therefore proposed that by utilising two designated bio-waste streams of PAS 100 accredited compost (PAS 100) and PAS 110 accredited anaerobic digestate separated fibre (ADSF), representing the organic matter, blended with china clay sand viable manufactured topsoil could be created. The soil quality, and thus suitability for the above niches, was deemed by analysing each blend for chemical indicators: electrical conductivity, pH, plant available nutrients, cation exchange capacity; physical indicators: bulk density, soil-water retention; and biological indicators: soil organic matter, and total carbon; as well as more tangible indicators, after seeding with perennial rye grass to measure: germination percentage, leaf and root measurements, and dry weight biomass. Values were then assessed against guidelines and a high-grade topsoil control. The results of the soil quality indicators were ranked accordingly and showed that a blend of 50 / 50 PAS 100 to china clay sand (CCS) {{has the potential to be}} the best mix. However, when just the tangible indicators were ranked the 50 / 50 ADSF compost and CCS outperformed the others. Soil-water retention was not incorporated into the ranking but showed that the pore sizes for all soils mixed with CCS had a conversely large proportion of transmission pores (> 60 μm) which readily drained the majority of water contents before field capacity. On the other hand, the high-grade topsoil had the opposite negative trait in which the majority of the water was held in pore spaces too small to be available to plants. It can be concluded therefore that the overall soil quality across the blends is poor primarily due to the low <b>water</b> <b>retentions.</b> This however could simply be due to the relative immaturity of the soils as a consequence of time. It is expected that, given time, factors such as bulk density, microbial biodiversity, and humus content would improve leading to an improvement in the <b>water</b> <b>retentions...</b>|$|R

30|$|Between the {{two common}} types of fabric {{softeners}} for home laundering (rinse cycle softener and dryer sheet softener), the dryer sheet softener is more popular in US households (over 60 % of households) (American Association on Textile Chemists and Colorists (AATCC) 2012). Dryer sheet softeners, which {{were introduced to}} the US market in the early 1970 s (Williams 1982), are fabric softeners saturated onto sheets of a non-woven fabric or polyurethane foam. Compared with rinse cycle softeners, dryer sheet softeners provide better anti-static properties, air permeability <b>retention,</b> <b>water</b> absorbency <b>retention,</b> and whiteness retention (Chen-Yu et al. 2009; Williams 1982; Wilson 1987). Dryer sheet softeners also form smaller pills and have no effect on flammability (Chen-Yu et al. 2008; Chiweshe and Crews 2000). However, dryer sheet softeners tend to have uneven softener deposition and are less effective in softening fabrics (Williams 1982). Although many households use fabric softeners during home laundering, no study comparing conventional and HE washers has included a fabric softener.|$|R
