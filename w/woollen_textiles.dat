5|$|Prior to the British Industrial Revolution, {{which saw}} a rapid {{economic}} expansion between 1750 and 1850, {{there were signs}} of small-scale industries scattered throughout Wales. These ranged from industries connected to agriculture, such as milling and the manufacture of <b>woollen</b> <b>textiles,</b> through to mining and quarrying. Until the Industrial Revolution, Wales had always been reliant on its agricultural output for its wealth and employment and the earliest industrial businesses were small scale and localised in manner. The emerging industrial period commenced around the development of copper smelting in the Swansea area. With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that could take advantage of Cornwall's copper mines and the copper deposits being extracted from the then-largest copper mine in the world at Parys Mountain on Anglesey, Swansea developed into the world's major centre for non-ferrous metal smelting in the 19th century. The second metal industry to expand in Wales was iron smelting, and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both {{the north and the south}} of the country. In the north of Wales, John Wilkinson's Ironworks at Bersham was a significant industry, while in the south, a second world centre of metallurgy was founded in Merthyr Tydfil, where the four ironworks of Dowlais, Cyfarthfa, Plymouth and Penydarren became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales. In the 1820s, south Wales alone accounted for 40% of all pig iron manufactured in Britain.|$|E
25|$|For {{hundreds}} of years streams from the surrounding hills provided water for corn and fulling mills. Todmorden grew to relative prosperity by combining farming with the production of <b>woollen</b> <b>textiles.</b> Some yeomen clothiers were able to build fine houses, a few of which still exist today. Increasingly, though, the area turned to cotton. The proximity of Manchester, {{as a source of}} material and trade, was undoubtedly a strong factor. Another was that the strong Pennine streams and rivers were able to power the machine looms. Improvements in textile machinery (by Kay, Hargreaves and Arkwright), along with the development of turnpike roads (1751–1781), helped to develop the new cotton industry and to increase the local population.|$|E
25|$|Huddersfield is a {{manufacturing}} town, despite the university being the largest employer. Historically the town produced <b>woollen</b> <b>textiles.</b> This area of business, {{along with the}} chemical and engineering industries that emerged to support the manufacture of textiles, was {{the basis of the}} town's nineteenth and early twentieth century prosperity. The number of people who work in textiles has declined greatly, but the surviving companies produce large quantities of woollen products with little labour. The town is home to textile, chemical and engineering companies, including Brook Motors Ltd founded by Ernest Brook in 1904. Against conventional wisdom, he started making alternating current electric motors, and he did this in one room with two assistants and starting capital of just £300. On its 50th anniversary in 1954 it employed more than 2,000 people and, with Ernest's sons Frank and Jack in charge, was the largest exclusive producer of AC motors in the world, and had a turnover of £4,500,000. That same year Brook Motors Ltd operated 10 factories in Huddersfield, its biggest being Empress Works on St Thomas's Road, and opened one at Barugh Green, Barnsley. Other local manufacturers are Cummins Turbo Technologies, founded in 1952 as Holset by Messrs. Holmes and Croset. (turbochargers), David Brown Gear systems (industrial gearing), Huddersfield Fine Worsteds (textiles), Taylor & Lodge (textiles), C & J Antich (textiles), Syngenta AG (agro-chemicals), Pennine Radio Limited (electronics transformers and sheet metalworking) and a large number of niche manufacturers, such as Dual Seal Glass (maker of spandrel glass panels) and Ellis Furniture (producer of kitchen and bathroom furniture).

Many districts, including Korvel, Oerle, Broekhoven, Hasselt, Heikant, De Schans, and Heuvel, bear the names of these old hamlets. The poor farmers living in these hamlets soon decided not to sell the wool from their sheep but to weave it themselves, and for a long time, much of the space inside their small houses was occupied by a loom—by the 17th century these numbered about 300. Enterprising people saw their chance. As so-called [...] "drapers" [...] they supplied the weavers with the raw materials for their [...] "home working", and the first Tilburg [...] "mill houses" [...] came into existence. From then on, the wool industry underwent rapid growth, and in 1881 Tilburg had as many as 145 woollen mills. Home weaving continued, however, until the early 20th century. <b>Woollen</b> <b>textiles</b> from Tilburg were known far and wide.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} human's exposure to permethrin from treated <b>woollen</b> <b>textile</b> floor coverings and possible adverse health effects, a study {{was carried out}} in 80 private homes in Hannover (Germany) equipped with <b>woollen</b> <b>textile</b> floor coverings (wool wall-to-wall carpets or woven or knotted rugs). For indoor monitoring, permethrin was determined both in house dust and on suspended particles. While permethrin concentrations in house dust (< 2 mm) were high (arithmetic mean: 53. 7 mg/kg, 90 th percentile 129. 1 mg/kg), the permethrin concentrations in the air (suspended particles) were very low (arithmetic mean 2. 8 ng/m 3, 90 th percentile 5. 8 ng/m 3, first sampling). Additional experiments demonstrate that permethrin on suspended particles result from carpet fiber abrasion (and not from an evaporation/re-condensation process). The internal exposure of the 145 inhabitants participating in the study was determined by biological monitoring (permethrin metabolites in urine). In a first sampling period almost 14 % of the samples showed concentrations of the metabolite DCCA and almost 23 % of the metabolite 3 -PBA above the limit of detection (0. 2 microgram/l). A model was developed which allows the calculation of the metabolite concentration in urine due to inhalative uptake of permethrin. Even for the worst case situation the calculated metabolite concentrations were ca. 30 times lower than the experimental results. The observed concentrations of metabolites are comparable to those of the background concentrations of the general population in Germany, suggesting that they must origin from other sources than <b>woollen</b> <b>textile</b> floor coverings. The indoor and biological monitoring data as well as the evaluation of the reported symptoms give no indication of an adverse health effect due to carpet treatment by permethrin...|$|R

The new mill was to supply the need for woollen cloth for working men in the coal and steel industries. In 1915, a hundred people were employed and flannel was produced for military uniforms for WWI. In 1919, fire broke out in the carding and spinning department and the damage caused was estimated at £20,000.

The two early colonies needed regular imports from England, sometimes of food but primarily of <b>woollen</b> <b>textiles.</b> The main early exports back to England included: sugar, tobacco, and tropical food. No large tobacco plantations or even truly organized defenses were established by the English on its Caribbean settlements at first and it would take time for England to realize just how valuable its possessions in the Caribbean could prove to be. Eventually, African slaves would be purchased through the slave trade. They would work the colonies and fuel Europe's tobacco, rice and sugar supply; by 1698 England had the largest slave exports with the most efficiency in their labor in relation to any other imperial power. Barbados, the first truly successful English colony in the West Indies, grew fast as the 17th century wore on and by 1698 Jamaica would be England’s biggest colony to employ slave labor. [...] Increasingly, English ships chose to use it as their primary home port in the Caribbean. Like Trinidad, merchants in the trans-Atlantic trade who based themselves on Barbados always paid good money for tobacco and sugar. Both of these commodities remained the key cash crops of this period and fueled the growth of the American Southern Colonies as well as their counterparts in the Caribbean.|$|E

In addition to these, Babani, along with Paul Poiret, had a license to retail textiles and garments by the Venice-based designer Fortuny, including his famous pleated silk Delphos gowns. Babani also imported textiles from the London department store Liberty & Co. From about 1919, when Vitaldi's fashion-designer son Maurice joined the business, the label began to focus more on clothing and produced garments which were heavily influenced by their imported merchandise. Maurice Babani's designs tended to be explicitly based upon their sources, such as a dress reproducing a North African embroidered robe, but using silk velvet rather than the <b>woollen</b> <b>textile</b> of the original.
