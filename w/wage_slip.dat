5|$|Whitney discovers she is {{pregnant}} by Lee, but all her hints {{and attempts to}} tell him fail. Linda realises and is ecstatic when Whitney confirms it. Linda tells Mick, and when Whitney tells Lee, Mick and Linda rush into the room to celebrate before {{he has a chance}} to let the news sink in. Whitney and Lee are both diagnosed with chlamydia and Whitney blames herself due to Rob. Abi admits to Whitney she had a one-night stand and gave Lee chlamydia. Whitney initially ends their relationship and considers leaving Walford, but later decides to give him another chance. Whitney is pleased when Ryan is released from prison and he tells her he is moving to Wakefield. He offers Whitney and Lee to move in with him and she accepts, but later declines when Linda strongly disapproves of them moving so far away. Whitney and Ryan share an emotional farewell. Whitney suffers spotting and is taken to hospital with Lee, Linda and Mick, where the bleeeding gets heavier. A scan shows Whitney has miscarried her baby, devastating her and Lee. Lauren encourages Whitney to find out whether she lost their baby due to him giving her chlamydia and she confides in Johnny (now Ted Reilly) that chlamydia might have caused it but tells Lee that the doctors said it could not have. Whitney decides to go Milton Keynes to stay with Bianca but returns the next day with Bianca's wedding dress and intends to get married. She reassures everyone she is fine and is thrown another hen party. Whitney marries Lee with Stacey acting as maid of honour in place of an ill Lauren and Tiffany and Lily as bridesmaids. Whitney is disappointed to learn that Lee was behind the robbery at The Vic but is unaware how close to suicide he was. She argues with Lee over money and Danny Mitchell (Liam Bergin) who tries to kiss her. Whitney then turns to Mick for support, and sleeps at The Vic. The next day she is reconciled with an apologetic Lee but finds his <b>wage</b> <b>slip</b> showing how little he earns. Following another argument with Lee, Whitney confides in Mick, telling him she is going to buy Ryan an engagement present. Later, a bus crashes into the market and Whitney is trapped underneath it. Whitney is rescued and in hospital, she talks to Mick about her marriage. He comforts her and she kisses him, which is seen by Denise Fox (Diane Parish). Whitney decides to organise a night out and pawns her wedding ring for cash. Lee discovers what she has done and they start arguing. When Whitney says he doesn't deserve her, Lee slaps her in the face. Shortly after the incident Whitney lays on the bed in silence, with Lee begging for forgiveness. Whitney confides in Lauren who strongly advises her to leave Lee.|$|E

5000|$|Mortgage lenders usually use {{salaries}} declared on <b>wage</b> <b>slips</b> to {{work out}} a borrower's annual income and will usually lend up to a fixed multiple of the borrower's annual income. Self-certification mortgages, informally known as [...] "self cert" [...] mortgages, are available to employed and self-employed people who have a deposit to buy a house but lack the sufficient documentation to prove their income.|$|R
2500|$|Form {{numbers are}} codes {{introduced}} by British Rail to classify and catalogue all printed material: documents, tickets, <b>wage</b> <b>slips,</b> notepaper, parcels labels {{and hundreds of}} other items. [...] Form numbers consist of a primary code and, often, a sub-code, separated by /. [...] APTIS tickets used primary code 4599 in British Rail days; this changed to 7599 on post-privatisation [...] "RSP" [...] tickets. [...] Other primary codes have since been introduced on Rail Settlement Plan ticket stock for New Generation (post-APTIS) ticket issuing systems.|$|R
50|$|If the IVA is approved, the {{insolvency}} practitioner named as supervisor in the approved IVA becomes the Supervisor of the IVA. This involves reporting annually to the creditors, debtor and the court. It also involves monitoring that the debtor is {{complying with the}} terms of the arrangement, agreeing creditor claims, making payments to creditors and generally ensuring that the arrangement progresses in accordance with {{the terms of the}} proposal. The debtor must comply with all reasonable requests of the supervisor, which may include periodically providing bank statements, accounts, <b>wage</b> <b>slips</b> etc.|$|R
50|$|An NLC {{covered the}} station {{and all of its}} {{associated}} accounting activities; it was on everything from tickets issued from self-service ticket machines to ticket office staff <b>wage</b> <b>slips.</b> Where stations on the same site needed to be treated as separate entities, they were allocated different codes. When London Waterloo's East (serving South Eastern Division destinations) began in the late 1980s to be considered as a separate station from the main London Waterloo (NLC 5598), its self-service machines got their own code, 5158. Revenue could then be apportioned correctly to the relevant Division, and, after privatisation, the correct Train Operating Company (TOC).|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{information}} {{is very common}} {{in all kinds of}} documents from newspapers and magazines to household bills and <b>wage</b> <b>slips.</b> However, many people find it difficult to understand, particularly people with poor education and disabilities. Sometimes numerical {{information is}} presented with hedges that modify the meaning. A numerical hedge is a word or phrase employed to indicate explicitly that some loss of precision has taken place (e. g., “around”) and it may also indicate the direction of approximation (e. g., “more than”). This paper presents a study of the use of numerical hedges that is part of research investigating the process of rewriting difficult numerical expressions in simpler ways. We carried out a survey in which experts in numeracy were asked to simplify a range of proportion expressions and analysed the results to obtain guidelines for automating the simplification task. ...|$|R
3000|$|... 32 A {{joint report}} by International Labor Organization et al. (2012) for the G 20 concludes that: “Maintaining the {{purchasing}} power of minimum wages at around 30 to 40 per cent of median wages sustains demand and reduces poverty and income inequalities. Statutory wage floors systematically set at levels significantly above that range entail the risk that these benefits {{would be more than}} offset by lost job opportunities, especially for youth and low-skilled workers. Allowing the minimum <b>wage</b> to <b>slip</b> significantly below that range risks exacerbating poverty while weakening demand” (p. 12). The IMF has also on occasion recommended an increase in the minimum wage, for example, in Lithuania in 2012.|$|R
