40|$|Neonicotinoids are {{systemic}} insecticides used {{in agriculture}} for seed treatment {{as well as}} in the pest control by spraying during plant growing. Also, they are found as an active substance in different phytosanitary products used in horticulture for <b>winter</b> <b>spraying</b> in fruit plantations when fruit trees are in vegetative rest. Taking into account the former studies on this topic, knowing all what is published regarding this important theme, both for agriculture and for beekeeping, the review is very important for all interested parts. In the present review many of the questions raised by the beekeepers and the scientists from agriculture receive an answer, together with described methods for identifying and quantifying this class of still used pesticide...|$|E
40|$|Concentrations of the {{triazine}} herbicides atrazine, simazine, cyanazine, metribuzin and propazine were determined in streams draining forestry and agricultural catchments in Tasmania, Australia, between 1989 and 1992. Atrazine and simazine were used extensively by the forestry industry in a <b>winter</b> <b>spraying</b> programme, and {{applications of the}} other herbicides occurred in cropped agricultural catchments during spring and summer. Of 29 streams sampled intensively for triazines, 20 contained detectable residues. Median contaminations over all samples were 2. 85, 1. 05, < 0. 05, < 0. 05 and < 0. 05 µg L- 1 for atrazine, simazine, cyanazine, metribuzin and propazine, respectively. All herbicide concentrations ranged over several orders of magnitude up to 53 mg L- 1, with atrazine and simazine having significantly higher concentrations than the others. Atrazine concentrations were examined in streams draining forestry plantations for periods of up to two years. A decline in concentration was observed with time, but this was strongly influenced by rainfall events. Atrazine contamination from single spraying events persisted at a low level for up to 16 months. Contamination of Big Creek with atrazine to 22 µg L- 1 after aerial spraying led {{to an increase in}} stream invertebrate drift only on the day of spraying and to a short-term increase in movement of brown trout. On examination of biological effects of triazines in surface waters reported in the literature, it was concluded that the observed frequent contamination of Tasmanian streams with triazines may cause occasional minor short-term disturbance to stream communities...|$|E

40|$|Phragmites australis {{has been}} {{expanding}} {{rapidly in the}} wetlands of the Great Salt Lake (GSL). Here we present {{the first two years}} of results for a multi-year study which examines the effectiveness of six treatments for controlling small (50 mx 20 m), dense patches of Phragmites along the eastern shore of the GSL. The treatments are 1.) summer mow, fall glyphosate spray, 2.) summer glyphosate <b>spray,</b> <b>winter</b> mow, 3.) fall glyphosate <b>spray,</b> <b>winter</b> mow, 4.) summer imazapyr <b>spray,</b> <b>winter</b> mow, 5.) summer mow, then black plastic solarization, 6.) untreated control. We found that all herbicide treatments, regardless of timing, were equally effective at reducing Phragmites percent cover. Summer mowing and summer herbicide spraying significantly reduced Phragmites inflorescence density compared with the fall herbicide treatment, greatly limiting the ability of Phragmites to spread further by seed. At this early stage, native plant recovery following all treatments was minimal, likely because of the deep litter layer that remains in all plots. The findings from this multi-year study will be used to develop best management practices for controlling Phragmites in GSL wetlands...|$|R

50|$|Typical {{applications}} of fungicides occur during prebloom and for 2-4 weeks post bloom. If {{the previous year}} was a conducive environment for infection or the current year had a warm <b>winter,</b> earlier <b>sprays</b> are recommended due to a potentially higher amount of overwintered cleistothecia. If warm and humid, conidia are produced every 5-7 days throughout the growing season. To limit powdery mildew resistance, growers alternate treatments by employing multiple modes of action.|$|R
40|$|The {{invasive}} plant, Phragmites australis {{has been}} expanding {{rapidly in the}} wetlands of the Great Salt Lake (GSL), replacing important habitat {{for the millions of}} migratory birds that rely on this ecosystem. Here we present four years of results for a multi-year study which examines the effectiveness of six treatments for controlling small (50 mx 20 m), dense patches of Phragmites along the eastern shore of the GSL. The treatments are 1.) summer mow, fall glyphosate spray, 2.) summer glyphosate <b>spray,</b> <b>winter</b> mow, 3.) fall glyphosate <b>spray,</b> <b>winter</b> mow, 4.) summer imazapyr <b>spray,</b> <b>winter</b> mow, 5.) summer mow, then black plastic solarization, 6.) untreated control. Results show that all herbicide treatments, regardless of timing, significantly reduce Phragmites cover, but Phragmites returns more quickly following summer treatments. Native plant recovery following all treatments is slow, particularly in important habitat-forming perennial bulrushes. Plant recovery has likely been inhibited by the dense Phragmites litter layer following repeated mowing. Summer mowing and summer herbicide spraying significantly reduced Phragmites inflorescence density compared with the fall herbicide treatment, greatly limiting the ability of Phragmites to spread further by seed. The findings from this multi-year study will be used to develop best management practices for controlling Phragmites in GSL wetlands...|$|R

40|$|A 3 -year {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the effect of five sanitation treatments on leaf litter density (LLD), leaf spot incidence, and percent defoliation on two cultivars (‘Újfehértói fürtös’ and ‘Érdi bőtermő’) in two sour cherry orchards: one managed by integrated pest management principles with conventional fungicides and the other managed organically. The following sanitation treatments were compared: sprays of urea or lime sulfur in autumn, removing fallen leaves after leaf fall, straw mulch cover in late <b>winter,</b> <b>sprays</b> of urea or lime sulfur followed by mulch cover, removing fallen leaves followed by mulch cover, and a nonsanitized control. In both orchards and all years, LLD decreased by 2 to 28 % in all treatment plots from early December to mid-May. LLD reduction was two to four times higher in the organic orchard compared with the integrated orchard. All treatments, except the lime sulfur or urea treatment alone, resulted in significant (P < 0. 05) reduction of LLD in both the integrated and organic orchards compared with nonsanitized plots. Only leaf removal alone or in combination with mulch significantly (P < 0. 05) reduced cherry leaf spot incidence and percent defoliation (by 11 to 70 % and 15 to 72 %, respectively) compared with nonsanitized plots. The application of these sanitation treatments in orchard management practices is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Diaphorina citri {{also known}} as Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) vectors Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, causal {{organism}} of the Asian “huanglongbing” or citrus greening disease and therefore needs to be managed effectively.   Forty-three insecticides containing 39 active ingredients (a. i) recommended or experimental were tested {{during the growing season}} in foliar sprays (171 treatments, 35 a. i) targeted at flushing trees and soil applications (26 treatments, 6 a. i) to control ACP in citrus between 2005 - 2012.   Psyllid suppression varied with product and lasted 1 - 7 weeks using foliar sprays on mature trees and 6 - 33 weeks using soil drenches in young trees.   Experimental insecticides tolfenpyrad (Apta 15 SC), flupyradifurone (Sivanto 200 SL), sulfoxaflor (Closer 240 SC), cyantraniliprole (Verimark), and Chromobacterium substugae (Grandevo/MBI- 203 EP) performed equal to or better than recommended products.   Unfortunately, eggs and young nymphs are protected inside unfolded leaves such that insecticidal sprays may kill more predators and parasitoids common during growing season that would otherwise attack immature ACP and other citrus pests.   Addition of new insecticides will broaden the range of products available to control ACP.   Nevertheless, one to two sprays of broad-spectrum insecticides during dormant winter period when most mature trees are not producing new growth and beneficial insects are scarce can provide up to 6 months of ACP suppression into growing season and also conserve beneficial insects.   Therefore, psyllid suppression using one or two dormant <b>winter</b> <b>sprays</b> of broad-spectrum insecticides followed by regular monitoring and rotation of relatively selective chemistries during growing season will help to reduce incidence of huanglongbing, pest resistance to insecticides and secondary pest outbreaks...|$|R
40|$|Board tested {{water quality}} in the San Joaquin River (SJR) {{watershed}} using toxicity tests. They found that water samples from {{certain areas of the}} watershed caused a species of water flea (Ceriodaphnia dubia) to die. Ceriodaphnia dubia is used in these toxicity tests because it is sensitive to insecticides and represents aquatic arthropods (one of the components of the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency three-species toxicity test). Based on these results, the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board suggested pesticides as the possible cause. The Department of Pesticide Regulation (DPR), which is responsible for preventing pesticide contamination of surface water and ground water, conducted a study in the SJR watershed. This report summarizes data collected during the <b>winter</b> dormant <b>spray</b> seasons of 199 1 - 92 and 1992 - 93. Subsequent reports will summarize results from other periods of high insecticide use. DPR scientists sampled one site to establish patterns of water quality characteristics and insecticide concentrations at different times during 1991 - 93. They also sampled many other sites throughout the watershed during several storms to determine mass loading of insecticides in the watershed...|$|R

40|$|Conventional almond {{growers in}} Merced and Stanislaus {{counties}} who use organophosphate, carb-amate and pyrethroid insecticides {{were compared with}} participants in the Biologically Integrated Orchard Systems (BIOS) program, who do not use these broad-spectrum insecticides. The results demonstrated consistent but not significantly lower infestation by navel orangeworm and peach twig borer for growers who used broad-spectrum sprays. Infestation by ants resulted in the most consistent {{difference between the two}} management practices, with significantly less damage when broad-spectrum sprays were used. The differences in overall pest damage were relatively minor, but the variation was greatest among those not using broad-spectrum <b>sprays.</b> <b>Winter</b> survival of the navel orangeworm parasitoid, Goniozus legneri, and parasitism by this beneficial insect were low in all orchards, <b>sprayed</b> or unsprayed. <b>Winter</b> removal of unharvested almonds to fewer than two per tree reduced navel orangeworm infestations in both treatments. Although many of the almond growers not using organo-phosphate, carbamate or pyrethroid sprays had less damage than some who used these materials, the greater range of damage experienced by these growers may explain why more almond growers prefer to use them annually to combat insect pests...|$|R
40|$|From November 2004 to December 2007, size-segregated aerosol {{samples were}} {{collected}} all-year-round at Dome C (East Antarctica) by using PM 10 and PM 2. 5 samplers, and multi-stage impactors. The data set obtained from the chemical analysis provided the longest and the most time-resolved record of sea spray aerosol (sea salt Na+) in inner Antarctica. Sea spray showed a sharp seasonal pattern. The highest values measured in winter (Apr-Nov) were about ten times larger than in summer (Dec-Mar). For the first time, a size-distribution seasonal pattern was also shown: in <b>winter,</b> sea <b>spray</b> particles are mainly submicrometric, while their summer size-mode is around 1 - 2 µm. Meteorological analysis on a synoptic scale allowed the definition of atmospheric conditions leading sea spray to Dome C. An extreme-value approach along with specific environmental based criteria was taken to yield stronger fingerprints linking atmospheric circulation (means and anomalies) to extreme sea spray events. Air mass back-trajectory analyses for some high sea spray events allowed the identification of two major air mass pathways, reflecting different size distributions: micrometric fractions for transport from the closer Indian-Pacific sector, and sub-micrometric particles for longer trajectories over the Antarctic Plateau. The seasonal pattern of the SO 4 ** 2 - /Na+ ratio enabled the identification of few events depleted in sulphate, {{with respect to the}} seawater composition. By using methanesulphonic acid (MSA) profile to evaluate the biogenic SO 4 ** 2 - contribution, a more reliable sea salt sulphate was calculated. In this way, few events (mainly in April and in September) were identified originating probably from the "frost flower" source. A comparison with daily-collected superficial snow samples revealed that there is a temporal shift between aerosol and snow sea spray trends. This feature could imply a more complex deposition processes of sea spray, involving significant contribution of wet and diamond dust deposition, but further work has to be carried out to rule out the effect of wind re-distribution and to have more statistic significance...|$|R
40|$|Algumas {{cultivar}}es de crisântemo, como a "Gompier Chá", apresentam menor crescimento quando cultivadas no período de inverno. A utilização do ácido giberélico (GA 3) e o manejo do fotoperíodo com dia curto interrompido podem ser alternativas para estimular o crescimentodas plantas. Assim, foi realizado um experimento com objetivo de avaliar a resposta do GA 3 e do dia curto (DC) interrompido por dias longos (DL) na qualidade de hastes de crisântemo de corte "Gompier Chá", cultivado no inverno no Rio Grande do Sul. O experimento foi conduzido na Universidade Federal de Santa Maria, no período de maio a agosto de 2001. Os tratamentos foram diferentes concentrações de ácido giberélico (50, 100, 200, 300, 500 e 500 mg L- 1) aplicadas seis, três, duas, duas, uma e duas vezes, respectivamente, e o uso de dia curto interrompido (32 DL+ 9 DC+ 12 DL+DC até a colheita). Os tratamentos que proporcionaram a formação de hastes de melhor qualidade foram as dosagens de 100 mg L- 1 aplicado três vezes e 200 mg L- 1 aplicado duas vezes. O esquema de dia curto interrompido usado foi ineficiente para a qualidade da cultivar "Gompier Chá", já o uso de ácido giberélico possibilitou melhoria no comprimento dos pedúnculos e na altura das plantas em cultivo de inverno no Rio Grande do Sul.
