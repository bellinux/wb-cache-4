The last remaining defensive location before the Hongorai was Egan's Ridge, where the Japanese were sheltering in tunnels. A heavy aerial and artillery bombardment devastated the position and forced them to abandon the ridge. It was subsequently occupied by a company of Australian infantry. Within {{a short period of}} time the Buin Road was subsequently opened, providing the Australians <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> with which to bring up supplies for the next stage of the campaign, being the advance to the Hari, Mobiai, and Mivo Rivers.

5|$|An {{interpretation}} of {{the story about the}} Ceklin zduhać is given in an essay by literary theoretician Radoman Kordić. According to him, the story {{is a product of the}} symbolic scheme of the culture of Montenegrin Serbs. The story comprises a zduhać narration and a heroic narration. The former is based on the mythological beliefs in the zduhaći, which were strongest in Montenegro. The latter is based on the heroic ideology exalting death in battle, which was a predominant trait of the Montenegrin society. The zduhać and the famous hero symbolize, respectively, two systems of the Montenegrin culture. At its beginning, the story is placed in the framework of the first system, but it is realized <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> and on the ideological plane of the second system. The beaten zduhać, who is supposed to die, diverges from the mythological pattern, and he replaces himself with the hero. This results in an ironic twist. The fearless hero acts in fact as a butcher of bulls which do not even fight back. The apparently happy ending degrades the zduhać into a subject without identity. Kordić argues, using mostly Lacanian psychoanalysis, that there is a third, silent narration in the story—that of the death drive—which crumbles the other two narrations.|$|E

25|$|After the War of 1812, {{relative}} stability allowed for {{increasing numbers of}} immigrants to arrive from Europe {{rather than from the}} United States. As {{was the case in the}} previous decades, this immigration shift was encouraged by the colonial leaders. Despite affordable and often free land, many arriving newcomers, mostly from Britain and Ireland, found frontier life with the harsh climate difficult, and some of those <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> eventually returned home or went south. However, population growth far exceeded emigration in the decades that followed. It was a mostly agrarian-based society, but canal projects and a new network of plank roads spurred greater trade within the colony and with the United States, thereby improving previously damaged relations over time.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to his preoccupation for the simplification of geometric structure, Cézanne was concerned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> of rendering the effect of volume and space. His rather classical color-modulating system consisted of changing colors from warm to cool as the object {{turns away from the}} source of light. Cézanne's departure from classicism, however, would be best summarized in the treatment and of application of the paint itself; a process in which his brushstrokes played an important role. The complexity of surface variations (or modulations) with overlapped shifting planes, seemingly arbitrary contours, contrasts and values combined to produce a strong patchwork effect. Increasingly in his later works, as Cézanne achieves a greater freedom, the patchwork becomes larger, bolder, more arbitrary, more dynamic and increasingly abstract. As the color planes acquire greater formal independence, defined objects and structures begin to lose their identity.|$|E

25|$|Cavallo {{was called}} by President de la Rúa in March 2001 to lead the economy once again, {{in the face of}} a {{weakened}} coalition government and two years of recession. He attempted to restore business confidence by renegotiating the external debt with the International Monetary Fund and with bondholders, but the growing country risk and spiraling put options by large investors and foreign holdings led to a bank run and a massive capital flight. In late November 2001, Cavallo introduced a set of measures that blocked the usage of cash, informally known as the corralito ("financial corral"). The anger of those Argentines <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> to invest abroad created a framework for the popular middle-class protest termed the cacerolazo. Political pressure by the Peronist opposition and other organized economic interests coincided with the December 2001 riots.

25|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, gunmaking {{was no longer}} a {{relatively}} simple affair as had been the case with the matchlock but had become an increasingly sophisticated process that required highly skilled individuals and complex machinery. Southeast Asian rulers could no longer depend on Europeans or foreign Asians to produce guns locally that were on par with those manufactured in Europe or European foundries in Asia. The Burmese like other Southeast Asians were dependent on the goodwill of the Europeans for the supply of their guns. The Europeans for their part were loath to provide the Southeast Asians <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>means</b> to challenge them. As a result, early Konbaung kings continually sought reliable European arms but rarely received them in quantity they wanted. Or sometimes, they could not pay for them. In the 1780s, the Chinese trade embargo of Burmese cotton greatly limited the crown's ability to pay for more advanced foreign firearms. Bodawpaya had to rely on domestic musket production, which could produce only low-tech matchlocks while the rival Siamese were transitioning to more advanced European and American supplied flintlocks. Still, the flintlock slowly began to replace the less efficient and less powerful matchlock in Burma. The army also began to obtain cast-iron cannon.|$|E
