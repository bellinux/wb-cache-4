5|$|Besides {{being one}} of the oldest {{surviving}} examples of Spanish architecture in California, the house gained much prominence by association with Helen Hunt Jackson's wildly popular 1884 novel Ramona. The Casa de Estudillo is one of three National Historic Landmarks in Southern California that <b>were</b> <b>closely</b> tied to Ramona, a novel of Californio life shortly after the American acquisition of California; the other two are Rancho Camulos and Rancho Guajome.|$|E
5|$|Famed American {{illustrator}} Norman Rockwell's works <b>were</b> <b>closely</b> {{associated with}} the Boy Scouts of America {{for much of the}} 20th century.

50|$|Though {{the family}} {{includes}} three genera of blind, subterranean, and troglobitic catfishes, Trogloglanis, Satan, and Prietella, {{none of these}} three genera <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> related. Instead, Satan <b>is</b> <b>closely</b> related to Pylodictis, Prietella to Noturus, and Trogloglanis possibly to Ictalurus, although it may not <b>be</b> <b>closely</b> related {{to any of the}} other ictalurids. Ameiurus is sister to a clade formed by Satan, Pylodictis, Noturus, and Prietella.|$|R
5|$|Rebeccah Cradock, Matthew's second wife, {{remarried}} to Benjamin Whichcote, another senior {{figure of}} the Cambridge Platonists, Provost of King's College, Cambridge, a close colleague of Ralph Cudworth's.

5|$|Administration and {{religion}} <b>were</b> <b>closely</b> linked {{in the system}} of the Celestial Masters. Adherents were grouped by families, and each was attached to a district. Families and districts, and the gods all held copies of civil registers. The registers were detailed records of the people, and recorded each person's rank, identity and location. Any changes to those registered had to be accompanied by a monetary contribution known as a 'wage of faith.' Requests to the gods followed a bureaucratic model, and were drawn up according to specific administrative codes. The effectiveness of these requests depended upon the accuracy of the registers kept by the gods.|$|E

5|$|After Singora {{had been}} destroyed, Sultan Sulaiman's sons were pardoned and {{assigned}} to new positions in Siam. Later generations of Sultan Sulaiman's family <b>were</b> <b>closely</b> connected with Siamese royalty: two of Sulaiman's descendants commanded armed forces led by Prince Surasi in the 1786 conquest of Pattani; Princess Sri Sulalai, a consort of King Rama II {{and mother of}} King Rama III, was also descended from Sultan Sulaiman. Present-day descendants include Admiral Niphon Sirithorn, a former Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Navy General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, the 22nd Prime Minister of Thailand; and a family of silk weavers at the Muslim village of Phumriang in Surat Thani.|$|E
5|$|As {{a symbol}} of the Caliph's ritual role {{as the leader of the}} Muslim community, they <b>were</b> <b>closely</b> paralleled in {{official}} propaganda by the leadership by Abbasid family members of the annual pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca. In addition, the constant warfare on the Syrian marches was useful to the Abbasids as it provided employment for the Syrian and Iraqi military elites and the various volunteers (muṭṭawi‘a) who flocked to participate in the jihad.|$|E
5|$|Beechwood Theater, {{a replica}} of the Little Theater on Broadway, was {{included}} in Wells Bosworth's design of the primary school building because Vanderlip particularly wanted his own theater. Beechwood Theater, with 256 gold velvet seats, was designed by Winthrop Ames around 1917. Details <b>were</b> <b>closely</b> examined upon construction; the lighting equipment, the scene lofts and fly gallery, and the dressing rooms were well-designed and state-of-the-art. The stage floor was designed especially for dancing, and the acoustics and theater proportions made varieties of productions possible.|$|E

5|$|Constantine's {{monetary}} policies <b>were</b> <b>closely</b> {{associated with}} his religious ones, in that increased minting {{was associated with}} measures of confiscation—taken since 331 and closed in 336—of all gold, silver and bronze statues from pagan temples, who were declared as imperial property and, as such, as monetary assets. Two imperial commissioners for each province had the task of getting hold of the statues and having them melted for immediate minting—with {{the exception of a}} number of bronze statues who were used as public monuments for the beautification of the new capital in Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|In Chicago, the Irish {{dominated}} {{social and}} athletic clubs that <b>were</b> <b>closely</b> {{tied to the}} political structure of the city. Some had acted as enforcers for politicians. As the first major group of 19th-century European immigrants to settle in the city, the Irish had established formal and informal political strength. In Chicago, ethnic white gangs had been attacking people in African-American neighborhoods, and the police, overwhelmingly white and increasingly Irish-American, seemed little inclined {{to try to stop}} them. Meanwhile, newspapers carried sensational accounts of any African American allegedly involved in crime.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the District and the Met <b>were</b> <b>closely</b> {{associated}} and it {{was intended}} that they would soon merge. The Met's chairman and three other directors were {{on the board of}} the District, John Fowler was the engineer of both companies and the construction works for all of the extensions were let as a single contract. The District was established as a separate company to enable funds to be raised independently of the Met.|$|E

5|$|Lemur {{taxonomy}} is controversial, {{and not all}} experts agree, {{particularly with}} the recent {{increase in the number}} of recognized species. According to Russell Mittermeier, the president of Conservation International (CI), taxonomist Colin Groves, and others, there are nearly 100recognized species or subspecies of extant (or living) lemur, divided into five families and 15genera. Because genetic data indicates that the recently extinct subfossil lemurs <b>were</b> <b>closely</b> related to living lemurs, an additional three families, eight genera, and 17species can be included in the total. In contrast, other experts have labeled this as taxonomic inflation, instead preferring a total closer to 50 species.|$|E
5|$|Little {{more than}} a year after her birth, Maria Theresa was joined by a sister, Maria Anna, and another one, named Maria Amalia, was born in 1724. The portraits of the {{imperial}} family show that Maria Theresa resembled Elisabeth Christine and Maria Anna. The Prussian ambassador noted that she had large blue eyes, fair hair with a slight tinge of red, a wide mouth and a notably strong body. Unlike many other members of the House of Habsburg, neither Maria Theresa's parents nor her grandparents <b>were</b> <b>closely</b> related to each other.|$|E
5|$|People {{who kept}} more {{traditional}} ways had settlements along the Tamiami Trail {{and tended to}} speak the Mikasuki language. They later were federally recognized in 1962 as the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida. As metropolitan areas in South Florida began to grow, the two groups <b>were</b> <b>closely</b> associated with the Everglades. They struggled to maintain privacy while serving as tourist attractions. They earned money by wrestling alligators and selling craftworks. As of 2008, the Seminole Tribe of Florida had five reservations, and the lands of the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians were collectively considered a sixth reservation. The two tribes have each developed casino gaming on some of their properties to generate revenue for support, services and economic development.|$|E

5|$|Q'uq'umatz greatly {{expanded}} the K'iche' kingdom, first from Pismachi' and later from Q'umarkaj. At this time, the K'iche's <b>were</b> <b>closely</b> {{allied with the}} Kaqchikels. Q'uq'umatz sent his daughter to marry {{the lord of the}} K'oja, a Maya people based in the Cuchumatan mountains, somewhere between Sacapulas and Huehuetenango. Instead of marrying her and submitting to the K'iche'-Kaqchikel alliance, Tekum Sik'om, the K'oja king, killed the offered bride. This act initiated a war between the K'iche'-Kaqchikel of Q'umarkaj and the K'oja. Q'uq'umatz died in the resulting battle against the K'oja.|$|E
5|$|Tandy {{drew the}} inside {{sketches}} {{for the first}} 26 volumes of the series as well as painting the covers of the first 26 volumes {{with the exception of}} volume 11– the cover artist for volume 11 is unknown. Tandy read each text before he began sketching, so his early covers <b>were</b> <b>closely</b> connected to specific scenes in the plots. He also hand-painted the cover lettering and designed the original Nancy Drew logo: a silhouette of Nancy bending slightly and looking at the ground through a quizzing glass.|$|E
5|$|The Grenztruppen <b>were</b> <b>closely</b> watched {{to ensure}} that they could not take {{advantage}} of their inside knowledge to escape across the border. Patrols, watchtowers and observation posts were always manned by two or three guards at a time. They were not allowed to go out of each other's sight in any circumstances. If a guard attempted to escape, his colleagues were under instructions to shoot him without hesitation or prior warning; 2,500 did escape to the West, 5,500 more were caught and imprisoned for up to five years, and a number were shot and killed or injured in the attempt.|$|E
