2500|$|The European rabbit is {{well known}} for digging {{networks}} of burrows, called warrens, where it spends most of its time when not feeding. Unlike the related hares (Lepus spp.), rabbits are altricial, the young being born blind and furless, in a fur-lined nest in the warren, and they are totally dependent upon their mother. Much of the modern research into <b>wild</b> <b>rabbit</b> behaviour was carried out in the 1960s by two research centres. One was the naturalist Ronald Lockley, who maintained a number of large enclosures for <b>wild</b> <b>rabbit</b> colonies, with observation facilities, in Orielton, Pembrokeshire. Apart from publishing a number of scientific papers, he popularised his findings in a book The Private Life of the Rabbit, which is credited by Richard Adams as having {{played a key role in}} his gaining [...] "a knowledge of rabbits and their ways" [...] that informed his novel Watership Down. The other group was the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia, where numerous studies of the social behavior of wild rabbits were performed. Since the onset of myxomatosis, and the decline of the significance of the rabbit as an agricultural pest, few large-scale studies have been performed and many aspects of rabbit behaviour are still poorly understood.|$|E

[...] The production opened during a heat wave and played for only three weeks in London (after more successful tryouts out of town), sustaining over Â£1,000 in losses, a serious loss for Lytton this early in his career. Later, Lytton bailed out some friends who {{had run out of}} money while producing a tour of Melnotte, an operatic version of the comedy The Lady of Lyons. [...] This also lost money.|$|E
40|$|Sera from 823 <b>wild</b> <b>rabbits</b> (Oryctolagus cuniculus) {{collected}} {{from a number}} of geographic regions of Victoria, Australia over the past eight years were examined for antibodies to Encephalitozoon cuniculi, along with sera from 46 hares (Lepus europaeus) (Pallas) and 57 New Zealand <b>wild</b> <b>rabbits.</b> No sera were positive, implying that this common laboratory rabbit parasite is absent from <b>wild</b> <b>rabbits</b> in these areas. However, <b>wild</b> <b>rabbits</b> were found to be readily infected by the oral route with small numbers of tissue-culture-grown spores of E. cuniculi. A possible explanation for the absence of encephalitozoonosis in <b>wild</b> <b>rabbits</b> is that E. cuniculi infection places them at a biological disadvantage for survival.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Infrared video {{observations}} {{were used to}} study behaviour in the nestboxes of both adult <b>wild</b> and domestic <b>rabbits.</b> A total of 1080 hours of observations of <b>wild</b> <b>rabbits</b> and 1008 hours of observations of domestic rabbits kept in two enclosures with free access to two nestboxes and some other hiding-places were analysed. Both wild and domestic adult rabbits spent a considerable part of their time (54. 9 % in wild and 30. 6 % in domestic rabbits) in pairs or in groups of three and voluntarily were in body contact between 65. 3 % (domestic rabbits) and 80. 4 % (<b>wild</b> <b>rabbits)</b> of the time. While crouching together, both <b>wild</b> and domestic <b>rabbits</b> used {{only a very small}} nestbox space: 0. 08 to 0. 125 m 2 /animal in wild and 0. 14 to 0. 21 m 2 /animal in domestic rabbits. Between 7 a. m. and 4 p. m., an average of 2. 9 animals from a maximum of 3 <b>wild</b> <b>rabbits</b> stayed in the nestboxes. Domestic rabbits used nestboxes less: an average of 0. 9 adults were in the nestbox between 7 a. m. and 4 p. m. Adult domestic rabbits spent much more time than <b>wild</b> <b>rabbits</b> resting outside the nestbox including a wooden tube leading to the nestbox.

2500|$|Throughout {{the western}} Mediterranean region, the Eurasian Eagle-Owl is {{something}} of a specialist on a single prey species: the European rabbit. The rabbit historically reached extremely high densities in Iberian scrub, i.e. more than 40 per every 1 square hectare (2471 square acres). In central Spain, up to 73.1% of the prey that were recorded for Eurasian eagle-owls, by number, can be rabbits. Where still available, they are also the main prey in Portugal and central France. However, following the devastation of the <b>wild</b> <b>rabbit</b> due to rabbit haemorrhagic disease, the local eagle-owls have frequently had to adapt to other, often smaller, prey. On the other hand, given the now much reduced numbers of rabbits, the eagle-owls still regularly select rabbits, seemingly out of proportion to their commonality. Although large mature wild rabbits commonly weigh , the eagle-owls usually hunt smaller specimens, often with an average weight around , with young rabbits usually selected in spring and summer and subadults selected in the autumn and winter. This is largely due to the behaviour of rabbits, with younger rabbits being forced to distribute following weaning, being less cautious in behaviour and occupying less primary habitat, thus being forced out of the confines of their burrows more regularly than mature adults. However, the estimated average weight of rabbits taken can be variable, reported from as little as [...] in a study from Spain to as much as [...] in the Netherlands.|$|E

40|$|AbstractMyxoma {{virus was}} {{introduced}} into the European rabbit population of Australia in 1950. Although the virus was initially highly lethal in rabbits, there was rapid selection for less virulent strains of virus and innately resistant rabbits. To investigate the basis of resistance to myxoma virus, we have compared the pathogensis of the virulent strain of myxoma virus originally released into Australia and an attenuated, naturally derived field strain of myxoma virus. This was done in laboratory rabbits, which have not been selected for resistance, and in <b>wild</b> <b>rabbits</b> that have developed significant resistance. <b>Wild</b> <b>rabbits</b> were able to recover from infection with virus that was always lethal in laboratory rabbits. Laboratory rabbits were able to control and recover from infection with attenuated virus. This virus caused a trivial disease in <b>wild</b> <b>rabbits.</b> There was little difference between laboratory and <b>wild</b> <b>rabbits</b> in titers of either virulent or attenuated virus in the skin at the inoculation site. However, resistant <b>wild</b> <b>rabbits</b> had a 10 - to 100 -fold lower titer of virulent virus within the lymph node draining the inoculation site and controlled virus replication in tissues distal to the draining lymph node. Replication of virus in lymphocytes or fibroblasts cultured from <b>wild</b> and laboratory <b>rabbits</b> demonstrated that resistance was not due to altered cellular permissivity for replication. Neutralizing antibodies were present in both susceptible and resistant rabbits, suggesting that these have no significant role in resistance. We hypothesise that resistance is due to an enhanced innate immune response that allows the rabbit to mount an effective cellular immune response...|$|R
60|$|In the <b>wild</b> <b>rabbit</b> (figure 13, A a) this vertebra, viewed on the {{inferior}} surface, has a transverse process, which is directed obliquely backwards, {{and consists of}} a single pointed bar; in the fourth vertebra this process is slightly forked in the middle. In the large lop-eared rabbits this process (B a) is forked in the third vertebra, as in the fourth of the <b>wild</b> <b>rabbit.</b> But the third cervical vertebrae of the wild and lop-eared (A b, B b) rabbits differ more conspicuously when their anterior articular surfaces are compared; for the extremities of the antero-dorsal processes in the <b>wild</b> <b>rabbit</b> are simply rounded, whilst in the lop-eared they are trifid, with a deep central pit. The canal for the spinal marrow in the lop-eared (B b) is more elongated in a transverse direction than in the wild rabbit; and the passages for the arteries are of a slightly different shape. These several differences in this vertebra seem to me well deserving attention.|$|E

60|$|I have {{carefully}} examined skulls of ten large lop-eared rabbits, and of five common domestic rabbits, which latter {{differ from}} the lop-eared only in not having such large bodies or ears, yet both larger than in the <b>wild</b> <b>rabbit.</b> First for the ten lop-eared rabbits: in all these the skull is remarkably elongated in comparison with its breadth. In a <b>wild</b> <b>rabbit</b> the length was 3.15 inches, in a large fancy rabbit 4.3; whilst {{the breadth of the}} cranium enclosing the brain was in both almost exactly the same. Even by taking as the standard of comparison the widest part of the zygomatic arch, the skulls of the lop-eared are proportionally to their breadth three-quarters of an inch too long. The depth of the head has increased almost in the same proportion with the length; it is the breadth alone which has not increased. The parietal and occipital bones enclosing the brain are less arched, both in a longitudinal and transverse line, than in the <b>wild</b> <b>rabbit,</b> so that the shape of the cranium is somewhat different. The surface is rougher, less cleanly sculptured, and the lines of sutures are more prominent.|$|E

But the variations in these respects in the <b>wild</b> <b>rabbit</b> are very slight: whilst in the large lop-eared rabbits they are considerable. Thus in some specimens (B) the oblique terminal knob is developed into a short bar, forming an obtuse angle with the rectangular bar. In another specimen (C) these two unequal bars form nearly a straight line. The apex of the acromion varies much in breadth and sharpness, as may be seen by comparing figures B, C, and D.|$|E
6000|$|I have {{previously}} remarked that, {{if we had}} possessed many domestic rabbits of the same average size with the <b>wild</b> <b>rabbit,</b> {{it would have been}} easy to compare the capacity of their skulls. Now the Himalayan, Moscow, and Angora rabbits (Nos. 11, 12, 13 of Table 3) are only a little larger in body and have skulls only a little longer, than the wild animal, and we see that the actual capacity of their skulls is less than in the wild animal, and considerably less by calculation (column 7), according to the difference in the length of their skulls. The narrowness of the brain-case in these three rabbits could be plainly seen and proved by external measurement. The Chinchilla rabbit (No. 14) is a considerably larger animal than the <b>wild</b> <b>rabbit,</b> yet the capacity of its skull only slightly exceeds that of the <b>wild</b> <b>rabbit.</b> The Angora rabbit, No. 13, offers the most remarkable case; this animal in its pure white colour and length of silky fur bears the stamp of long domesticity. It has a considerably longer head and body than the <b>wild</b> <b>rabbit,</b> but the actual capacity of its skull is less than that of even the little wild Porto Santo rabbits. By the standard of the length of skull the capacity (see column 7) is only half of what it ought to have been! I kept this individual animal alive, and it was not unhealthy nor idiotic. This case of the Angora rabbit so much surprised me, that I repeated all the measurements and found them correct. I have also compared the capacity of the skull of the Angora with that of the <b>wild</b> <b>rabbit</b> by other standards, namely, by the length and weight of the body, and by the weight of the limb-bones; but by all these standards the brain appears to be much too small, though in a less degree when the standard of the limb- bones was used; and this latter circumstance may probably be accounted for by the limbs of this anciently domesticated breed having become much reduced in weight, from its long-continued inactive life. Hence I infer that in the Angora breed, which is said to differ from other breeds in being quieter and more social, the capacity of the skull has really undergone a remarkable amount of reduction.] ...|$|E
