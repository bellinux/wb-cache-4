5|$|Jamie Pearson was {{responsible}} for editing the episode. The sequence where Lucas rescues Harry and Ruth near the end were made in slow motion, because the producers felt it <b>would</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the tension. The incidental music was composed by Paul Leonard-Morgan. The computer graphics on the episode were designed by Mark Doman. The producers ended up being receptive of both Morgan and Doman's work, because {{of their ability to}} help interpret the story via the music, and computers, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Issues {{surrounding}} {{the planning and}} construction of L'Enfant Plaza (immediately {{to the west of}} the site) delayed construction of any buildings on the block until the late 1960s. In 1963, the RLA purchased the land from the Westminster Memorial Church, Fifth Baptist Church, and homeowners. The United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare wished to purchase the site for its new headquarters, but the RLA declined to sell the property. (The federal government does not pay taxes on land and structures it owns, and the RLA wanted a private owner who <b>would</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the tax base.) The RLA attempted to sell the land on January 29, 1965, but there were no buyers.|$|E
5|$|The {{institution}} {{of the welfare state}} was by 1957 accepted by both major parties. Diefenbaker promised to expand the national health insurance scheme to cover tubercular and mental health patients. He characterized the old age pension increase which the Liberal government was instituting as a mere pittance, not even enough {{to keep up with the}} cost of living. Diefenbaker noted that the increase only amounted to twenty cents a day, using that figure to ridicule Liberal contentions that an increase <b>would</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the rate of inflation. All three opposition parties promised to increase the pension, with the Social Crediters and CCF even stating the specific amounts it would be raised by.|$|E

In addition, if the bi-national projects El Tigre (in the Lempa River) and El Jobo and Piedra de Toro (in the Paz River) with Honduras and Guatemala were carried out, 488MW of additional capacity <b>would</b> be <b>added</b> <b>to</b> the generation system.|$|R

25|$|Patients with decompensated {{cirrhosis}} generally require {{admission to}} a hospital, with close {{monitoring of the}} fluid balance, mental status, and emphasis on adequate nutrition and medical treatment – often with diuretics, antibiotics, laxatives or enemas, thiamine and occasionally steroids, acetylcysteine and pentoxifylline. Administration of saline is avoided, as it <b>would</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the already high total body sodium content that typically occurs in cirrhosis.|$|E
25|$|More {{firms are}} {{investigating}} the potential of fractionating technology to remove corn germ (i.e. {{the portion of the}} corn kernel that contains oil) prior to the ethanol process. Furthermore, some ethanol plants have already announced their intention to employ technology to remove the remaining vegetable oil from dried distillers grains, a coproduct of the ethanol process. Both of these technologies <b>would</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the biodiesel raw material supply.|$|E
25|$|The Balmoral Flouring Mill, {{formerly}} a four run stone mill of first class reputation, had a modern improved system of patent rolls {{with an easy}} capacity of 100 barrels per day. Its flour had earned a high reputation in the general markets and commanded a ready sale. At the time of incorporation it was run by water power rarely equalled in the province which <b>would</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the profits of the business.|$|E

25|$|Ripple {{current is}} the AC {{component}} of an applied source (often a switched-mode power supply) whose frequency may be constant or varying. Ripple current causes heat to be generated {{within the capacitor}} due to the dielectric losses caused by the changing field strength together with the current flow across the slightly resistive supply lines or the electrolyte in the capacitor. The equivalent series resistance (ESR) {{is the amount of}} internal series resistance one <b>would</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> a perfect capacitor to model this.|$|E

Additionally, he voted {{for all of the}} 2010 governmental appropriations bills, and he {{voted for the}} Continuing Appropriations Act for 2011. However, he has voted against some large spending bills, including opposing the release of $350billion in bank bailout funds and a $154billion spending bill because of concerns these <b>would</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the federal deficit.|$|E
25|$|The Wayne County Airport Authority's latest FAA Master Plan {{includes}} {{a number of}} proposed future developments to be considered at such time as demand warrants and funding is available. A significant element of this plan is growing air service nearly 60 percent until 2030. The goals are to include better connectivity to the Middle-East, India, and nonstop flights to several key destinations in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. This addition <b>would</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the airport's four existing parallel runways and its two crosswind runways in order to alleviate future congestion.|$|E

25|$|The {{land that}} now makes up Edgbaston Cricket Ground was {{originally}} {{owned by the}} Calthorpe Estate, who have now sold the site onto Wylam Investments (Edgbaston Holdings) on a long lease. Calthorpe Estates had developed the manor of Edgbaston into an exclusive Birmingham suburb {{over the course of}} the 19th century, and believed that a cricket ground would be an asset that <b>would</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the genteel image of the area. Warwickshire County Cricket Club had considered Rugby and Leamington Spa for their headquarters, but club secretary William Ansell believed that Birmingham's large population and comprehensive railway connections made it preferable – envisaging first-class status for the county and Test status for the ground.|$|E
25|$|Fogg {{had thought}} it was one day more than it {{actually}} was, because he had forgotten this simple fact. During his journey, he had added a full day to his clock, at the rhythm of an hour per fifteen degrees, or four minutes per degree, as Verne writes. At the time, {{the concept of a}} de jure International Date Line did not exist. If it did, he would have been made aware {{that it would be a}} day less than it used to be once he reached this line. Thus, the day he <b>would</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> his clock throughout his journey would be thoroughly removed upon crossing this imaginary line. But a de facto date line did exist since the UK, India and the US had the same calendar with different local times, and he should have noticed when he arrived to the US that the local date was not the same as in his diary (his servant Jean Passepartout kept his clock in London time, despite the tips of his surroundings).|$|E
25|$|The 2007–08 season saw {{a return}} of Junior B Colts alumnus Drake Berehowsky to the team. This time as {{assistant}} coach. He left the team {{at the end of}} the 2008–09 season. The Colts season was an average one. They would finish with a 28–34–3–3 record; good for seventh in the Eastern Conference. Second year forward Alex Hutchings led the Colts in offence throughout the year, finishing with a team high 54 points. Several other forwards including Tomas Marcinko, Cory McGillis, Stefan Della Rovere, and rookie Daniel Michalsky <b>would</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the Colts offence. Throughout the year, several trades were made, sending goaltender Andrew Perugini, and high-scoring forward Vladimir Nikiforov away, while bringing in many new faces including Colt Kennedy, Ryan Berard, Andrew Clouthier, and future captain Dalton Prout. Goaltender Peter Di Salvo, defenceman Stephen Gaskin, Marcus Pepe as well as forward Kyle Clifford all made their debut for the Colts this year, becoming the core of a Colts team for many years to come. In the playoffs the Colts would again meet Brampton Battalion, this time sweeping them in a four-game playoff series. In the conference semi-finals the Colts would lose a quick series to the Belville Bulls 4 games to 1.|$|E

500|$|On 10 March 2015, Dontnod {{announced}} {{they had already}} completed the story for a possible sequel, Remember Me 2. Dontnod creative director Jean-Maxime Moris said [...] "We know {{what we would do}} for Remember Me 2. The main story has been written we know what we <b>would</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the recipe. We know what we would fix. It's a game that's ready to be made, but that decision is Capcom's to make". However, Moris added that Dontnod intended to work on another season of Life Is Strange before proceeding with the sequel to Remember Me. A sequel is reportedly no longer viable with Capcom; Dontnod CEO Oskar Guilbert admitted that while [...] " [...] did OK", only Life Is Stranges unexpected success saved the company from [...] "a very difficult" [...] financial situation.|$|E
500|$|The crew's {{bodies were}} {{initially}} examined by senior medical officer, Surgeon-Captain Richard [...] "Rick" [...] Jolly of the Royal Navy. The helicopter's wreckage was inspected on-site, but the British {{were unable to}} determine {{if it had been}} destroyed by Cardiffs missiles or by Argentine fire. This uncertainty prompted the decision not to hold a board of inquiry, and XX377 was declared [...] "lost in action". It was surmised that, if the relatives of the deceased were told that the Gazelle might have been lost to friendly fire, it <b>would</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> their grief. After the war, missile fragments found in the wreckage were taken to the British government's aviation research facility at RAE Farnborough for analysis. The scientific tests concluded that the fragments were not from a British Sea Dart missile, despite a Sea Dart casing later being found [...] "several hundred yards" [...] away from the wreckage.|$|E
500|$|The tracks [...] "Somnus" [...] and [...] "Omnis Lacrima" [...] {{from the}} game were {{included}} in compilation albums of Shimomura's music, and the former was released as downloadable content for Theatrhythm Final Fantasy when XV was still known as Versus XIII. Despite being a tune from a game which had then been in development for six years, Theatrhythm producer Ichiro Hazama decided to include it {{as it was a}} widely known song among the fans by that point, and that its inclusion <b>would</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> Theatrhythms purpose as a celebration of the Final Fantasy series for its 25th anniversary. Nomura also approved of the song's inclusion. A live concert was performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios on September 7, 2016. It featured 12 tracks {{from the game}}, and featured a guest appearance by Shimomura. Selections from the game will also be played by the Video Game Orchestra in Tokyo on March 25, 2017, alongside those of several other series. Orchestal performances of the instrumental version of [...] "Somnus" [...] and the track [...] "Apocalypsis Noctis" [...] were included in the album Distant Worlds IV: More Music from Final Fantasy, which released on June 30, 2017.|$|E

500|$|Nutter joined Conference National side Lincoln City on a free {{transfer}} in July 2011. Signing a two-year deal with Lincoln, Nutter stated — [...] "I {{think it will}} benefit {{me to have a}} fresh start, play in front of new people and show what I can do. I feel I'm better than this level but I've got to show that and we have to show that as a team". His Lincoln debut came on the opening day of the 2011–12 season, playing the whole match as Lincoln twice squandered a lead to draw 2–2 with Southport at Haig Avenue. He scored his first goal for the club in November 2011, netting Lincoln's third with a shot from outside the area in a 3–0 home win over Ebbsfleet United. Nutter <b>would</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> his goal tally once more during the campaign when he scored a 20-yard free-kick in an important 2–0 win against relegation rivals Newport County on 24 March 2012. Nutter played in all 51 of Lincoln's matches during the season, with the club struggling to adapt during their first season back in non-league, finishing just above the relegation places.|$|E
500|$|Originally modeled in Max Payne {{after the}} game's writer Sam Lake, Max's {{appearance}} was remodeled after professional actor Timothy Gibbs for Max Payne 2; James McCaffrey returned {{as the voice}} of Max. The game's plot was written by Lake, who decided to write it as a film noir love story, as he felt that it suited Max's persona the best. Lake hoped that the story would break new ground, noting, [...] "At least it's a step into the right direction. I'd like nothing better than to see new and unexpected subject matters to find their way to games and stories told in games." [...] Lake remarked that basic, archetypal film noir elements found in many classics of the genre [...] "can go a long way" [...] when telling a story, and gave examples that included a hostile, crime-ridden city; a story that takes place late at night with heavy rain; and a cynical, hard-boiled detective down on his luck. Lake considered writing a sequel to Max Payne an [...] "art of [...] own". Since the setting and characters were already established, Lake decided that the primary goal of the sequel was [...] "to keep what's good and fix what was not so good", and to take the story in surprising directions. The screenplay for the sequel ended up being three times longer than the one for Max Payne. Lake predicted that the more complex story <b>would</b> <b>add</b> <b>to</b> the game's replay value.|$|E
