Keywords : cow 2 ̆ 7 s urine, shallot, types of mulchThe aim of {{this research}} was to evaluate the influence of types of mulch and dose of cow 2 ̆ 7 s urine on the growth and production of shallot. The research was conducted at the experimental field of Agricultural Faculty, North Sumatra University which about ± 25 metres above sea level, from April to July 2015. The researh was arranged by randomized block design with two factors, i. e: types of mulch (no mulch, silver black plastic, black plastic, and rice straw) and dose of cow 2 ̆ 7 s urine (0, 500, 600, 700 ml/plot). Parameter observed were plant height, number of leaves per clump, number of tillers per clump, diameter of bulbs per sample, bulb fresh <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> sample, bulb dry <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> sample, bulb fresh <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> plot, and bulb dry <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> plot. The results showed that the type of mulch significantly affect to number of tillers per clump parameter at 3 weeks after planting. The aplication of cow 2 ̆ 7 s urine did not give significant effect to all parameters observed...|$|R

However, in laboratory studies it is usually necessary to avoid biological variation and to achieve this, laboratory mice are almost always fed only commercial pelleted mouse feed. [...] Food intake is approximately [...] per [...] of body <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> day; water intake is approximately [...] per 100 g of body <b>weight</b> <b>per</b> day.|$|R

An online hybrid between BPTT and RTRL with intermediate complexity exists, along with variants for continuous time.|$|R
