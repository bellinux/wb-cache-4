Of the patients who stated that they would pay out-of-pocket for the procedure, the median (IQR) amount they <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay <b>was</b> $ 750.00 (1500.00). Moreover, when {{patients were}} asked if they would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> travel outside of Canada and pay out-of-pocket to have an ACLR, 41 (16.4 %) said yes, 151 (60.4 %) said no, and 58 (23.2 %) said that they were unsure. If patients stated they <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay to travel outside of Canada to have the procedure performed, the median (IQR) amount they <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for this option was $ 2500.00 (3750.00).

WALL-E has minimal dialogue {{in its early}} sequences; many of the characters do not have voices, but instead communicate with body language and robotic sounds designed by Burtt. The film criticizes consumerism, corporatism, nostalgia, waste management, human environmental impact and concerns, obesity, and global catastrophic risk. It is also Pixar's first animated film with segments featuring live-action characters. Following Pixar tradition, WALL-E was paired with a short film titled Presto for its theatrical release.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This survey {{investigated}} {{the willingness to}} pay for an improved water quality and reliability in Chobe ward in Maun. On average, 54 % of the households <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for improved water quality. It is therefore apparent that Chobe Ward, Maun residents in general regard water as an economic good as they <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for its provision. Those with a higher income <b>were</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for an improved water quality and reliability of supply. This finding corroborates the environmental economic theory which assumes that the demand for an improved environmental quality increases with income. The older the person the more they <b>are</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for improved water quality and reliability. Larger families <b>are</b> not <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for an improved provision of water services. Also, educated people <b>are</b> lesser <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for improved water quality and reliability...|$|R

5|$|As Rana Bahadur Shah's {{bodyguard}} and advisor, Bhimsen Thapa also {{accompanied him}} to Varanasi. Rana Bahadur's retinue included his first wife, Raj Rajeshwari Devi, while his second wife, Subarna Prabha Devi, stayed back in Kathmandu {{to serve as}} the regent. Since Rana Bahadur <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> do anything to regain his power and punish those who had forced him to exile, he served as a focal point of dissidenting factions in Varanasi. In November 1800, he first sought help from the British in exchange for which he <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> concede a trading post in Kathmandu and grant them 37.5% of the tax revenue derived from the hills and 50% from the terai. However, the British were in favor of working with the existing government in Nepal, rather than risk the uncertainties of restoring an exiled ex-King to power. The Kathmandu Durbar <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> appease the British and agreed to sign a commercial treaty so long as the wayward Rana Bahadur and his group were held in India under strict British surveillance. This arrangement was kept a secret from Rana Bahadur and his group; but when they eventually became aware of the strictures on their movement, and hence the treaty, they were incensed at the British as well as the proponents (Damodar Pande and his faction) of this treaty in Nepal. An intrigue was set in motion with the aim of splitting the unity of courtiers in Kathmandu Durbar and fomenting anti-British feelings. A flurry of letters were exchanged between the ex-King and individual courtiers in which he tried to set them up against Damodar Pande and tried to woo them by promises of high government positions, which they could hold for their entire life, and which could be inherited by their progeny. Baburam Acharya holds Bhimsen responsible for all these schemes, reasoning that Rana Bahadur did not have the mental capacity for such negotiations and intrigues. He contends that Bhimsen was responsible for negotiation with the British as well as responsible for writing letters {{in the name of the}} ex-King, while the ex-King was bidding his time in debauchery.|$|E

On 13 January 1874 Bergen city council started issuing stock for the Voss Line, to begin with 400,000 Norwegian speciedaler (NOK 1.6 million) was issued. In the 1873 parliamentary election the railway supporter Peter Jebsen was elected, spending {{the next few years}} furiously defending the railway. Parliament chose to not issue new railway projects in the 1874 session, and instead make a complete plan for all railway construction in the country—to be proposed by a committee. When the report was launched on 20 March 1875, the Voss Line was not included since it could not show a higher profitability than 1%. During the 1875 session there was not a majority for the Voss Line, partially {{due to the lack of}} capital available for local investors. This was based on a claim from Johan Jørgen Schwartz, the chairman of the committee, that the investment costs were underestimated. This was countered by Nils Henrik Bruun, a constructor from Bergen, who <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> construct all tunnels on the railway for less than the budgeted sum. When Jebsen in addition <b>was</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> act as personal guarantee for Bruun in case of his death, the majority in the parliament shifted.
