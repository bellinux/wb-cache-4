40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the macroscopic performance of friction stir welded automotive tailor-welded blank (TWB) sheets, the hardening behavior, anisotropic yielding properties and forming limit diagram were characterized both for base (material) and <b>weld</b> <b>zones.</b> In order to describe the Bauschinger and transient hardening behaviors as well as permanent softening during reverse loading, the modified Chaboche type combined isotropic–kinematic hardening law was applied. As for anisotropic yielding, the non-quadratic anisotropic yield function, Yld 2000 - 2 d, was utilized for base material zones, while isotropy was assumed for <b>weld</b> <b>zones</b> for simplicity. As for <b>weld</b> <b>zones,</b> hardening properties were obtained using the rule of mixture and selectively by direct measurement using sub-sized specimens.

In this work, four automotive sheets were considered: aluminum alloy 6111 -T 4, 5083 -H 18, 5083 -O and dual-phase steel DP 590 sheets, each having one or two thicknesses. Base sheets with the same and different thicknesses were friction-stir welded for tailor-welded blank (TWB) samples...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—During welding, {{the amount}} of heat present in <b>weld</b> <b>zones</b> determines the quality of {{weldment}} produced. Thus, the heat distribution characteristics and its magnitude in <b>weld</b> <b>zones</b> with respect to process variables such as tool pin-shoulder rotational and traveling speed during welding is analyzed using thermal finite element analyses method. For this purpose, transient thermal finite element analyses are performed to model the temperatures distribution and its quantities in weld-zones with respect to process variables such as rotational speed and traveling speed during welding. Commercially available software Altair HyperWork is used to model three-dimensional tool pin-shoulder vs. workpieces and to simulate the friction stir process. The results show that increasing tool rotational speed, at a constant traveling speed, will increase {{the amount of}} heat generated in weld-zones. In contrary, increasing traveling speed, at constant tool pin-shoulder rotational speeds, will reduce the amount of heat generated in <b>weld</b> <b>zones...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a refined analysis for evaluating low-cycle fatigue crack initiation life of welded beam-to-column connections of steel frame structures under strong earthquake excitation. To consider different length scales between typical beam and column components {{as well as}} a few crucial beam-to-column welded connections, a multiscale finite element (FE) model having three different length scales is formulated. The model can accurately analyze the inelastic seismic response of a steel frame and then obtain in detail elastoplastic stress and strain field near the <b>welded</b> <b>zone</b> of the connections. It is found that the <b>welded</b> <b>zone</b> is subjected to multiaxial nonproportional loading during strong ground motion and the elastoplastic stress-strain field of the <b>welded</b> <b>zone</b> is three-dimensional. Then, using the correlation of the Fatemi-Socie (FS) parameter versus fatigue life obtained by the experimental crack initiation fatigue data of the structural steel weldment subjected to multiaxial loading, the refined evaluation approach of fatigue crack initiation life is developed based on the equivalent plastic strain at fatigue critical position of beam end seams of crucial welded connections when the steel frame is subjected to the strong earthquake excitation...|$|R

50|$|The arc is {{maintained}} {{independently of the}} workpiece or parts being welded. The hydrogen gas is normally diatomic (H2), but where the temperatures are over 600 C near the arc, the hydrogen breaks down into its atomic form, absorbing {{a large amount of}} heat from the arc. When the hydrogen strikes a relatively cold surface (i.e. the <b>weld</b> <b>zone),</b> it recombines into its diatomic form, releasing the energy associated with the formation of that bond. The energy in AHW can be varied easily by changing the distance between the arc stream and the workpiece surface. This process is being replaced by gas metal-arc welding, mainly because of the availability of inexpensive inert gases.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} was to study the mechanical properties of a magnesium alloy welded by a CO 2 laser. Residual stresses were measured by X-ray diffraction. They were calculated by the classic sin 2 Y method in the isotropic zones by using the orientation distribution function (ODF) in the textured zones. The results demonstrated that laser welding results {{in the formation of}} a number of different zones with different microstructural and mechanical properties. Welding principally leads to a reduction in grain size and a new distribution of phases. The most remarkable observation was that of a superficial layer {{on the surface of the}} <b>welded</b> <b>zone.</b> This layer has the peculiarity of a marked crystallographic texture, a reduction in the level of aluminium as well as an elevated microhardness. These characteristics disappear after a depth of 200 μm under the <b>welded</b> <b>zone.</b> These modifications can be explained by the nature of the solidification which occurs under nonequilibrium conditions resulting in an equiaxial columnar transition. This transition is also evident within the profile of residual tensile stresses which are at their maximum at the interface between the superficial layer and the rest of the <b>welded</b> <b>zone.</b> These results are explained by the anisotropic properties of the textured layer in relation to the plasticity...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to study the effect of Post Weld Heat Treatment on the micostructural and {{strength}} properties of high chromium steel [AISI 410] components. This work also aims to estimate the magnitude and distribution of the residual stress on the above type of welded components. In introducing this work an extensive literature survey on the historical development and {{the advantages and disadvantages}} of welding process has been presented. A review of the different technique which are used to determine the residual stress is also presented. In this work two types of Post Weld Heat Treatment were used. in the first type of heat treatment, the specimen was kept at 316 °C for 30 min, then at 427 °C for 30 min, and finally, at 546 ®C for 2 hrs. In the second type of heat treatment the specimen was kept at 760 °C for 2 hrs. Two types of specimens were used to simulate build-up welding and crack repair conditions, each type of these specimens have different parameters (thickness, bead length and width). Stress relaxation technique was used to detemine the magnitude and distribution of the residual stresses for the above specimens. The results show that the first type of heat treatment reduces the hardness in the <b>welding</b> <b>zone</b> by about 15 % of the hardness of the as welded specimen and improves the tensile strength. The second type of heat treatment decreases the hardness in the <b>welding</b> <b>zone</b> by about 40 % but decreases the tensile strength by about 10 %.

50|$|The {{weldability}} {{of aluminium}} alloys varies significantly, depending on the chemical composition of the alloy used. Aluminium alloys are susceptible to hot cracking, and to combat the problem, welders increase the welding speed to lower the heat input. Preheating reduces the temperature gradient across the <b>weld</b> <b>zone</b> and thus helps reduce hot cracking, but it can reduce the mechanical properties of the base material {{and should not be}} used when the base material is restrained. The design of the joint can be changed as well, and a more compatible filler alloy can be selected to decrease the likelihood of hot cracking. Aluminium alloys should also be cleaned prior to welding, with the goal of removing all oxides, oils, and loose particles from the surface to be welded. This is especially important because of an aluminium weld's susceptibility to porosity due to hydrogen and dross due to oxygen.|$|E

40|$|This study {{develops}} {{and presents}} a friction stir weld (FSW) quality assurance tool based on control of <b>weld</b> <b>zone</b> temperature. Apart from correct tool geometry, tool tilt angle, traverse speed and forge force during welding, one important requirement {{is that the}} weld material be sufficiently plasticised (softened). The level of plasticisation is related to <b>weld</b> <b>zone</b> temperature which is primarily dependent on spindle speed, traverse speed and forge force. When all other conditions are correct, sufficiently plasticised material flows around and consolidates behind the tool without the production of voids in the weld.
