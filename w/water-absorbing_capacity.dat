Variation in WAC, therefore, should interest persons in the USA concerned with exporting soybeans to these countries.

40|$|AbstractCytoplasm {{is thought}} to have many hydrogel-like characteristics, {{including}} the ability to absorb large amounts of water and change volume in response to alterations in external environment, as well as having limited leakage of ions and proteins. Some gel-like behaviors have not been rigorously confirmed in mammalian cells, and others should be examined under conditions where gel volume can be accurately monitored. Thus, possible contributions of cytoplasm hydrogel properties to cellular processes such as volume sensing and regulation remain unclear. We used three-dimensional imaging to measure volume of single substrate-attached cells after permeabilization of their plasma membrane. Permeabilized cells swelled or shrinked reversibly in response to variations of external osmolality. Volume changes were 3. 7 -fold greater than observed with intact cells, consistent with cytoplasm's high <b>water-absorbing</b> <b>capacity.</b> Volume was maximal at neutral pH and shrunk at acidic or alkaline pH, consistent with pH-dependent changes of protein charge density and repulsive forces within cellular matrix. Volume shrunk with increased Mg 2 + concentration, as expected for increased charge screening and ionic crosslinking effects. Findings demonstrate that mammalian cytoplasm resembles hydrogel and functions as a highly sensitive osmosensor and extracellular pH sensor. Its high <b>water-absorbing</b> <b>capacity</b> may allow rapid modulation of local fluidity, macromolecular crowding, and activity of intracellular environment...|$|E
40|$|A mucoadhesive spray-dried starch/poly(acrylic acid) powder {{underwent}} different {{heat treatments}} {{in order to}} induce cross-linking between the functional groups of starch (Amioca (R)) and poly(acrylic acid) (Carbopol (R) 974 P). After heat treatment the <b>water-absorbing</b> <b>capacity,</b> viscosity and elasticity of the mucoadhesive powder increased. NMR analysis in combination with FT-IR indicated that heat treatment induced a low degree of cross-linking between the polymers. Nasal administration of Amioca (R) /Carbopol (R) 974 P powders without heat treatment resulted in an absolute bioavailability in rabbits of 8. 2 +/- 3. 0 % for insulin. Due to the difference in <b>water-absorbing</b> <b>capacity</b> (which opened the tight junctions of the nasal mucosa), elasticity and plasticity (which reduced mucociliairy clearance and prolonged residence time) heat treatment at 120 degrees C improved the bioavailability: 26. 4 +/- 21. 9, 36. 5 +/- 11. 0 and 19. 3 +/- 17. 3 % after heat treatment during 30 min, 1 h and 4 h, respectively. Heat treatment at 60 degrees C was less efficient. This study demonstrated that the nasal insulin absorption improved via heat treatment of the Amioca (R) /Carbopol (R) 974 P powder (prior to the addition of insulin). The bioavailability-enhancing effect of a 1 h heat treatment at 120 degrees C was confirmed using the same polymer matrix in combination with different drugs (salmon calcitonin, human growth hormone and metoprolol tartrate).

For each replication the vegetable was divided in half to serve as its own control. One half was used raw {{and the other half}} was cooked in 60 ml of distilled water for 7 to 8 minutes. Internal temperature of the cooked samples verified a uniform cooking process. Moisture and NDF were determined in both raw and cooked samples. A texture reading, determined by shear force, was also done on the cooked samples. The resulting NDF residues from the raw and cooked samples were used to compare <b>water-absorbing</b> <b>capacity</b> and ash content. In terms of 100 g dry weight, NDF decreased in cooked cauliflower from 19. 13 to 17. 22 g (p< 0. 05) and increased in cooked carrots from 9. 47 to 10. 54 g (p< 0. 05). The exact opposite was observed for <b>water-absorbing</b> <b>capacity.</b> It increased in cooked cauliflower and decreased in cooked carrots. Ash content showed large variations but a general increase in both vegetables after cooking. No positive relationship was found between texture and NDF in the cooked vegetables. These observations confirm the complex nature of dietary fiber.

The relation of water absorption and acid-base properties of the surface is considered. The advantages of the research of acid-base properties of the surface by the pH-metry method are illustrated. The algorithm of the processing and interpretation of pH metric results to diagnose water absorption of powdery substances is suggested. The diagnostics is based on the research of velocity variation of mass transfer in the reaction zone in time. The change of pH suspension per unit of time is considered {{for the first time as}} an analytic signal of «WрН» mass transfer velocity.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, {{a series}} of chitosan-g-poly(acrylic acid) /vermiculite (CTS-g-PAA/VMT) {{superabsorbent}} composites containing VMT, acid-activated, ion-exchanged, and organic modified VMT were synthesized by free-radical graft polymerization in aqueous solution, using N,N’-methylenebisacrylamide as a cross-linker and ammonium persulfate as an initiator. The effects of VMT and modified VMT on equilibrium water absorbency, swelling rate, and swelling behavior in various cationic saline solutions (NaCl, CaCl 2, and FeCl 3) and different pH value solution of superabsorbent composites were systematically investigated. FTIR spec-troscopy confirmed that acrylic acid had been grafted onto CTS and the OH groups of VMT participated reaction. The introduction of acid-activated, ion-exchanged, and organic modified VMT into chitosan-g-poly(acrylic acid) polymeric network could improve water absorbency and swelling rate {{compared with that of}} VMT.

40|$|The soil mantle in Namaqualand is {{immature}} {{in terms}} of weathering. Despite or even because of this, the diversity and spatial variability of soil {{physical and chemical properties}} is exceptionally high and could be fundamental in governing biodiversity and ecosystem function. In arid landscapes, the way the soil sheds, admits, stores, diverts and transmits water is crucially important. Namaqualand's soils possess special features, which modify water infiltration, hydraulic conductivity and subsurface storage and provision of water to plants. These include pedodermal crusts; a natural mulch of surface gravel or desert pavement; water-repellent soils with fingered infiltration of rain water; textural discontinuities at depth; subsurface horizons cemented with silica, calcite, fibrous clays or gypsum; soluble salts that affect plant water uptake osmotically; clay minerals having exceptional <b>water-absorbing</b> <b>capacity</b> and that are unique to arid environments; and a mechanism, in deeper sandy soils, for thermally induced upward transport of water vapour-a kind of nocturnal distillation-that seems to lessen the need for plants to root deeply.

40|$|The {{interest}} in and importance of systemic drug delivery via the nasal route have expanded in recent decades since nasal administration offers an interesting alternative for the conventional oral and parenteral drug delivery routes. In this thesis, the nasal route was selected as an alternative route for peptide and vaccine delivery. A spray-dried combination of maize starch (Amioca®) and a cross-linked acrylic acid-based polymer (Carbopol® 974 P) was used as powder carrier to amplify the mucoadhesive capacity of the formulation. In a {{first part of the}} study, the Amioca®/Carbopol® powder formulation was subjected to a heat treatment procedure. After heat treatment the <b>water-absorbing</b> <b>capacity,</b> viscosity and elasticity of the muco-adhesive powder increased. NMR analysis in combination with FT-IR indicated that heat treatment induced a low degree of cross-linking between the polymers. Nasal administration of Amioca®/Carbopol® 974 P powders without heat treatment resulted in an absolute bioavailability in rabbits of 8. 2 ± 3. 0 % for insulin. Due to the difference in <b>water-absorbing</b> <b>capacity</b> (which opened the tight junctions of the nasal mucosa), elasticity and plasticity (which reduced mucociliairy clearance and prolonged residence time) heat treatment at 120 °C improved the bioavailability: 36. 5 ± 11. 0 after heat treatment during 1 h. In a second part of the study, the Amioca®/Carbopol® mixture was co-spray-dried with metoprolol tartrate (used as model molecule) in order to develop a powder suitable for nasal drug delivery via a one-step manufacturing process. The bioavailability of metoprolol tartrate after nasal administration of this powder to rabbits was compared with powders manufactured via other procedures. The study showed that co-processing of a mucoadhesive Amioca®/Carbopol® 974 P formulation with metoprolol tartrate via co-spray-drying did not provide an added value towards the bioavailability of the drug after nasal administration of the mucoadhesive powder. In a third part of the study, the Amioca®/Carbopol® powder formulations spray-dried in different ratios (ratio: 0 / 100; 25 / 75; 50 / 50; 85 / 15; 100 / 0, w/w) were used as carriers of a viral antigen. A comparison of these formulations for intranasal delivery of heat-inactivated influenza virus combined with LTR 192 G adjuvant was made in vivo in a rabbit model. Individual rabbit sera were tested for seroconversion against hemagglutinin (HA), the major surface antigen of influenza. It was demonstrated that the use of bioadhesive carriers based on Amioca® starch and poly(acrylic acid) facilitates the induction of a systemic anti-HA antibody response after intranasal vaccination with a whole virus influenza vaccine...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reports on}} the {{fabrication}} of cotton fabrics with single-faced superhydrophobicity using a simple foam finishing process. Unlike most commonly reported superhydrophobic fabrics, the fabrics developed in this study exhibit asymmetric wettability on their two faces: one face showing superhydrophobic behavior (highly nonwetting or water-repellent characteristics) and the other face retaining the inherent hydrophilic nature of cotton. The superhydrophobic face exhibits a low contact angle hysteresis of θa/ θr = 151 / 144 (θa, advancing contact angle; θr, receding contact angle), which enables water drops to roll off the surface easily so as to endow the surface with well-known self-cleaning properties. The untreated hydrophilic face preserves its water-absorbing capability, resulting in 44 % of the <b>water-absorbing</b> <b>capacity</b> {{compared to that of}} the original cotton samples with both sides untreated (hydrophilic). The single-faced superhydrophobic fabrics also retain moisture transmissibility that is as good as that of the original untreated cotton fabrics.

Fabric materials with such asymmetric or gradient wettability will be of great use in many applications such as unidirectional liquid transporting, moisture management, microfluidic systems, desalination of seawater, flow management in fuel cells, and water/oil separation.

40|$|Oral {{processing}} during bread {{consumption is}} a key process related to the dynamics of texture perceptions, sensory stimuli release and starch digestion. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the respective contribution of bread properties (composition and structure of crumb and crust) and of the oral physiology of subjects to the breakdown pathways in the mouth. The properties of the in vivo bread bolus obtained from eight healthy subjects were studied at three key points in time during their oral processing. The progressive lubrication and breakdown of bread were observed, as well as the beginning of the enzymatic degradation of starch. The study showed that "time" was the factor responsible for the greatest variability in bolus properties. Breakdown pathways were established for crumbs with and without crust. The presence of crust modified the oral processing, increasing, for instance, the heterogeneity of particle size at the middle of the oral processing sequence. Moreover, the hydration capacity of crust contributed to high starch degradation at swallowing time, in comparison with crumb alone. The main subject characteristics impacting bolus properties were the in-mouth duration, the individual masticatory index and the mouth volume, while the main bread properties explaining the bolus properties were the initial composition and the <b>water-absorbing</b> <b>capacity.</b> We concluded that both crumb and crust structures had an impact on the oral processing, affecting the capacity of hydration, the rheology and the breakdown degree of the bolus...|$|E
40|$|Like parts or {{structures}} assembled from common isotropic engineering materials, fiber reinforced composites can {{be subjected}} to impact loading during their service life. Fiber composites have, nevertheless, a unique interaction with the externally applied load, since severe internal damage can be generated without any external sign. In fact, several damage mechanisms can be operating, viz. matrix cracking, fiber breakage, fiber pullout, fiber-matrix interface rupture and delamination. The challenge of non-destructive quality control is to establish safe boundaries {{for the use of}} a composite part or structure, which has been subjected to an impact event not causing non-repairable failure. For the range of possible impact velocities many parameters could be involved on the composite response, such as the mass and the geometry of the impactor; the laminate stacking sequence; among others, the kind, architecture and volume of reinforcement fibers. In our work, we have focused our attention on two woven fabric reinforced composites: one reinforced with E-glass fibers and the other with basalt ones, both subjected to low velocity impact at different energies. Basaltfibers are produced from basalt rock using single component raw material by drawing and winding fibers from the melt. Once the basalt fibers have been produced, they are transformed into a suitable form for particular application.

The objective of the paper is to study the effect of buckwheat processing products (flour and flakes) on the technological process and quality of bread made from whole-wheat flour. This paper describes and analyzes research data on the rheological properties of dough samples which were determined by farinograph and amylograph. Investigation of structural and mechanical properties of dough showed an increase in <b>water-absorbing</b> <b>capacity</b> in all samples when adding buckwheat products. Moreover, dough made with buckwheat flakes has a lower value of mixing tolerance index (by 47 %) than dough made from buckwheat flour, and a higher valorimetric value (by 20 %). Determination of dough properties by amylogram has shown that a sample containing buckwheat flakes has a higher maximum viscosity than a sample containing buckwheat flour. Determination of the gas-production and gas-retention capacity of dough is also presented, along with an analysis of the quality of finished products {{based on the results of}} laboratory baking tests. The samples of bread supplemented with buckwheat flakes have better shape stability (by 21 %), specific volume (by 12 %) and porosity (by 11 %) than bread made from buckwheat flour. The organoleptic evaluation of finished product quality has shown that bread supplemented with buckwheat flakes has a more fluffy-texture, elastic crumb and uniform porosity than bread made from buckwheat flour. Buckwheat flakes proved to have a better effect on parameters of the technological process and quality of bread when compared with buckwheat flour. </p...|$|E
40|$|The suction between soil {{particles}} {{is the basis}} and core problem {{in the study of}} unsaturated soil. However, is the suction between {{soil particles}} just the matrix suction (which has been widely used since the discipline of unsaturated soil mechanics was established). In fact, the concept of matrix suction is from soil science and reflects the <b>water-absorbing</b> <b>capacity</b> of the soil. Matrix suction characterizes the interaction between soil particles and pore water rather than the interactions between soil particles, which were not in conformity with the principle of effective stress of soils. The suction of unsaturated soil, in essence, is the intergranular suction composed of absorbed suction and structural suction. In this paper, first, the basic concepts of absorbed suction and structural suction were briefly introduced. Then, with soil mechanics, powder science, crystal chemistry, granular material mechanics and other related disciplines of knowledge for reference, the quantitative calculation formulas were theoretically deduced for the absorbed suction for equal-sized and unequal-sized unsaturated soil particles with arbitrary packing and the variable structural suction for equal-sized unsaturated soil particles with arbitrary packing and unequal-sized unsaturated soil particles with close tetrahedral packing. The factors that influence these equations were discussed. Then, the shear strength theory of unsaturated soil was established based on the theory of intergranular suction through the analysis of the effective stress principle of unsaturated soil. This study demonstrates that the shear strength of unsaturated soil consists of three parts: The effective cohesive force, the additional strength caused by external loads and the strength caused by intergranular suction. The contribution of the three parts to the shear strength of unsaturated soil depends on the following influence factors: Soil type, confining pressure, water content and density. Therefore, these factors must be comprehensively considered when determining the strength of an unsaturated soil...|$|E

Coagulatory contact predominates over the other three types of contact. The authors provide their findings in terms of morphological peculiarities attributable to genetic differences of quaternary sands. The authors have completed an experimental research to identify the fixed water content in sands and artificial mixtures that have a sand grain size, and they have also analyzed dimensions of the per-unit surface of samples of natural sands and their fractions to identify correlation between morphological peculiarities of sands and their maximal molecular <b>water-absorbing</b> <b>capacity.</b> The authors have proven the presence of a correlation between the morphology of sand grains and their number in the test sample exposed to the research undertaking, as it determines the number of contacts between particles of sand. The experimental data has proven that the principal provisions of the physicochemical theory of effective stresses are applicable to sandy soils. Natural sands that have particles of different shapes and surface nature demonstrate different types of contacts that prevent compliance of analytical data with the results of experimental researches. Moreover, natural dimensions of coagulatory contact areas of "sandy" systems substantially exceed those identified analytically. Areas of per-unit surfaces of sands that contain particles with highly developed surfaces and clay films exceed those of rounded particles the surfaces of which are smooth and polished {{as a result of their}} soft friction in the water. This phenomenon boosts the thickness of adsorbed hydrated or solvated shells.
