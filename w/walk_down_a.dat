5|$|Communication {{with the}} outside world on the land side was {{maintained}} with the city through two main well-protected city gates, one placed on the western side {{of the city and the}} other placed on the eastern side. These entrances were constructed so that communications with the city could not be carried out directly; the messenger had to enter through multiple doors and <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> winding passageway, which is evidence of the security measures taken as a last defense against the possibility of a surprise breach or entrance of unexpected visitors.|$|E

After the man is arrested by campus security, his prophecy is proven true when Jason tries, but fails, to save Menand, who is promptly run over by a bus and killed at the exact time (11:46 pm).|$|E

Upon entering, the travelers realize that they have forgotten all of their abilities. The hooded man explains that the deeper {{they go into the}} castle, the more memories they will lose, but they will also uncover new memories in the process. He creates a deck of cards made from Sora's and his friends' memories, and tells them that everything they encounter in this castle will be based on their memories.|$|E

5|$|The video {{opens with}} an empty room with a fish painting, and then shows Madonna holding to {{what looks like a}} baby, but is {{actually}} a big bag of water. Alternating scenes shows her in a red and black kimono dancing to the song. Then, a scene features a group of people of Asian heritage, who <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> dark hallway. As Madonna sings the song in a black kimono, she grips onto the bag of water. When the chorus starts, it features Madonna in a red kimono continuing to dance. This scene carries on {{through the rest of the}} song. There are multiple scenes of Japanese people performing butoh dance moves coached by Swedish choreographer Su-En. These scenes were shot in a decommissioned R1 Reactor below the Royal Institute of Technology in central Stockholm. The ending scene has Madonna sitting while someone is painting her back and slowly rests her body on the group. As the song fades, Madonna is in her red kimono walking and laughing towards the camera and then the screen rapidly fades to black.|$|E

5|$|Although Sunnydale {{has long}} been {{familiar}} with demons and monsters who have inhabited the town and fed off its residents, in this episode the conventions by which societal functions are so disrupted by the unexplained silence that significant chaos results, enough to warrant both Riley and Buffy going on patrol to keep order. Buffy and Willow <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> familiar street, arm-in-arm and easily startled, and see a bank closed and patrons running into a liquor store that is obviously open. The breakdown of order also causes sudden religious fervor; {{a group of people}} have gathered on the street to read the Bible (Revelation 15:1 is written on a signboard—an allusion to the seven angels with seven plagues as there are seven Gentlemen, according to author Nikki Stafford). Opportunistic capitalist fervor results in a man selling overpriced dry erase boards. Community, notes Patrick Shade (citing sociologist George Herbert Mead), consists of institutions such as language, religion, and economics. When one institution disappears, Sunnydale residents begin to depend more heavily on the others. Mostly, however, individuals are isolated from one another during the silence. Even the Scoobies find their bonds shaken, as they are unable to use the witty banter that has marked them as a group thus far. (This awkwardness extended even to the actors: the first silent scene the entire cast attempted was the Scoobies gathering in Giles' apartment following the discovery that all of Sunnydale's denizens had lost their voices. It took several rehearsals as the scene came out mistimed, with all of the actors having trouble playing off one another without the use of verbal cues, or all pantomiming over one another.) Without a common language to fall back upon the Scoobies are forced to depend on their shared history to help them recover well {{enough to be able to}} take action.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{promising}} approach utilizes passive dynamics where the momentum of swinging limbs is used for greater efficiency. It {{has been shown that}} totally unpowered humanoid mechanisms can <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> gentle slope, using only gravity to propel themselves. Using this technique, a robot need only supply a small amount of motor power to walk along a flat surface or a little more to walk up a hill. This technique promises to make walking robots at least ten times more efficient than ZMP walkers, like ASIMO.|$|E

They pass a nearby graveyard, in which zombies begin to rise out of their caskets as Vincent Price {{performs}} his soliloquy. The zombies corner Michael and his date threateningly, and suddenly, Michael becomes a zombie himself. The zombies then break into an elaborate song and dance number, followed by the main chorus of [...] "Thriller" [...] (during which Michael was reverted to human form), frightening his date to the point where she runs for cover.|$|E

500|$|In {{the video}} the Pussycat Dolls are shown {{sitting in a}} car {{in the middle of a}} traffic jam, where Scherzinger flashes a ring that says [...] "famous". They sing the {{introduction}} of the song in the car before jumping out. When the chorus kicks in, the women leave the car and stand on the roofs of the other cars and start dancing a routine. Then they <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> street of Hollywood stars with bubbles floating all around them. As they walk down the street, they also stop to sing on a bench. As the second chorus starts, the Dolls climb scaffolding and begin to dance. During Scherzinger's solo, she stands in a small area with the Pussycat Dolls logo to the left and a mirror to the right, with lights flashing. The Dolls then dance in the breakdown section with the logo behind them and the camera zooms out to reveal filming equipment and playback screens.|$|E
500|$|Throughout the concert, a large, {{rotating}} LED {{screen is}} featured centre stage, projecting live images of Beyoncé and her twenty backup dancers to the audience. The concerts begins with Beyoncé performing [...] "Formation", alongside her all female dancers shadowing her and performing a choreography. [...] "Angry" [...] red lighting and pyrotechnics are displayed as [...] "Sorry", [...] "Bow Down" [...] and [...] "Run the World (Girls)" [...] are subsequently performed. [...] "Mine", [...] "Baby Boy" [...] and [...] "Hold Up" [...] are performed next, which then seamlessly transition into [...] "Countdown". During this performance, Beyoncé and her dancers perform and <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> catwalk {{leading to the}} middle of the crowd. Between sets and costume changes, video clips from Lemonade are projected onto the LED cuboid, as well as aerial dancers performing a choreography. Before performing [...] "Me Myself and I" [...] Beyoncé would often stop and talk to the crowd, speaking on the relationship she and the audience have with God and themselves. This act of the show was ended with a performance of [...] "All Night" [...] which Beyoncé stated was her favourite song from her aforementioned new album. [...] "Don't Hurt Yourself" [...] was performed with many interchangeable snippets of other songs including [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] and [...] "Independent Women". The next act consisted of Beyoncé and her dancers performing more up-tempo numbers, such as [...] "Feeling Myself", [...] "Yoncé", [...] "Drunk in Love" [...] and [...] "Partition". Another costume change took place, and the show continued with Beyoncé and her dancers performing [...] "Daddy Lessons" [...] and [...] "1+1". This was then followed by Beyoncé performing an a cappella rendition of [...] "Love on Top", which was said to connect Beyoncé with her fans and break down the space between them.|$|E
500|$|Matthew Rolston {{directed}} the music video for [...] "The Climb", which premiered on Cyrus's Myspace page on February 11, 2009. The video commences {{with a shot}} of Cyrus holding a guitar and a suitcase as she begins to <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> long path extending through a valley. At {{the end of the}} valley, the sun breaks out over a distant mountain. The entire scene is enhanced with computer-generated imagery. Cyrus has her hair tied in a bun and wears a traveling jacket, a gray tank top and cowboy boots. In a separate setting, Cyrus, wearing a gray short sleeve shirt and her hair loose, begins to sing [...] "The Climb" [...] beneath a blue spotlight in a purple room. The two settings alternate throughout the video. A vignetted scene from Hannah Montana: The Movie appears in front of Cyrus as she walks on the path. The video zooms into the scene and a montage of film clips plays, featuring Cyrus's character and her love interest, Travis Brody (played by Lucas Till) horseback riding. The video returns to Cyrus walking; she picks up a rose fallen on the path, then throws it behind her. As the video progresses, she also sees things such as a herd of horses and a shooting star cross her path. A new setting enters the video in which Cyrus dances in a purple room with a countdown or, occasionally, film clips projected on the wall behind her. Rain begins to pour in the path setting. Cyrus puts down her jacket, guitar case, suitcase and boots, and continues onwards with only her guitar strapped to her shoulder. More film clip montages play {{in the same manner as}} the first. As the last montage ends, Cyrus finally reaches the summit of a reddish, CGI mountain and triumphantly looks over the cliff's edge to watch the sun shining over a shimmering lake. An alternate version of the music video excluding the Hannah Montana: The Movie clips exists and was sent to several channels, including VH1.|$|E

500|$|The children's book The World's Angriest Boy in the World, {{which appears}} in Haller's {{memories}} of his childhood, was written by Hawley and published {{for use in the}} show. Stevens described it as [...] "the world's most twisted children's book", but useful for him to hold and read while acting. The physical manifestation of the book's title character was inspired by Edward Gorey drawings, with Wylie explaining that he [...] "loved the idea of him wearing a little velvet, Eddie Munster child’s funeral suit. That’s where that dude came from. He’s really scary." [...] Another manifestation of the Shadow King, the Devil with the Yellow Eyes, was inspired by the reality television series My 600-lb Life, with Wylie explaining, [...] "They do this amazing thing at the beginning of every episode of that show where they show the person struggling {{to get out of bed}} or <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> <b>a</b> hallway ... They light it badly just to make the person’s journey seem that much more difficult." [...] Boisclair was cast in the role due to his [...] height and slender frame, with prosthetics used to give him a [...] "gigantic body with no neck [...] really skinny arms and legs". Boisclair was called a [...] "rare and lucky find", akin to Bolaji Badejo, who portrayed the alien in the 1979 film Alien. Boisclair's prosthetics were designed by Sarah Pickersgill, under special effects makeup head Todd Masters, and took four-and-a-half hours to apply. Masters' team were also responsible for creating the body parts that are found sticking out of walls in the pilot, including Lenny's upper body and arm, produced from a silicone copy of Plaza; extensive bruising for Cary and Kerry Loudermilk after a major fight sequence, which was achieved with Pros-Aide transfers that were reduced each day to show the wounds healing; and the burn makeup for Linklater after he is injured in the pilot, which was designed to cover half his face and most of his chest and back, with just the face and neck requiring five separate prosthetics. Marcine Peter at Contour Contact Lens provided hand-painted contact lenses for the production, including for Boisclair to wear as the Devil with the Yellow Eyes.|$|E

[...] In Iso's translated words, it conveys how [...] "there will always be a distance between people, and even between things that seem within ones' reach.

Shadows of vintage microphones hover above the duo; Yunho grabs one and the microphone lights up. Music starts and the scene changes, with TVXQ whispering [...] "she got that something" [...] into lit-up vintage microphones while leaning back-to-back, supported by ropes. Zooming into Yunho's elbow, the scene changes again with Changmin strumming on ropes that are set up like a large string instrument by the dancers; Yunho follows suit while a double bass instrumental arrangement plays. The music then picks up and their back-up dancers start to dance. A big band music ensemble plays behind them.|$|E
