25|$|One common {{misconception}} of BDSM and kink is {{that women}} are more likely to take on masochistic roles than men. Roy Baumeister (2010) actually had more male masochists in his study than female, and fewer male dominants than female. The lack of statistical significance in these gender differences suggests that no assumptions should be made regarding gender and masochistic roles in BDSM. One explanation why <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>think</b> otherwise lies in our social and cultural ideals about femininity; masochism may emphasize certain stereotypically feminine elements through activities like feminization of men and ultra-feminine clothing for women. But such tendencies of the submissive masochistic role should not be interpreted as a connection between it and the stereotypical female role—many masochistic scripts do not include any of these tendencies.|$|E

In {{accordance}} with his wishes, his ashes were scattered near Tennant Creek, site of his 1929 forced landing during the search for the Kookaburra, from an RAAF Caribou on 15April 1981. His name figures prominently in the Northern Territory, commemorated by Lake Eaton in Central Australia, Eaton Place in the Darwin suburb of Karama, Charles Eaton Drive on the approach to Darwin International Airport, and the Charles Moth Eaton Saloon Bar in the Tennant Creek Goldfields Hotel. He is also honoured with a display at the Northern Territory Parliament, and a National Trust memorial at Tennant Creek Airport. At the RAAF's 2003 History Conference, Air Commodore Mark Lax, recalling Eaton's search-and-rescue missions between the wars, commented: [...] "Today, <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>think</b> of Eaton perhaps as the pioneer of our contribution to assistance to the civil community—a tradition that continues today. Perhaps I might jog your memory to a more recent series of rescues no less hazardous for all concerned—the amazing location of missing yachtsmen Thierry Dubois, Isabelle Autissier and Tony Bullimore by our P-3s that guided the Navy to their eventual rescue. My observation is that such activities remain vital for our relevance in that we must remain connected, supportive and responsive to the wants and needs of the Australian community." ...|$|E

2500|$|The term [...] "the Imaginary" [...] {{originates}} {{in the writings}} of the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan (see the Imaginary) and is strongly associated with Castoriadis' work. To understand it better <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>think</b> of its usual context, the imaginary institution of societies. By that, Castoriadis means that societies, together with their laws and legalizations, are founded upon a basic conception of the world and man's place in it. Traditional societies had elaborate imaginaries, expressed through various creation myths, by which they explained how the world came to be and how it is sustained. Capitalism did away with this mythic imaginary by replacing it with what it claims to be pure reason (as examined above). That same imaginary is, interestingly enough, the foundation of its opposing ideology, Communism. By that measure he observes (first in his main criticism of Marxism, titled the Imaginary Institution of Society, and subsequently in a speech he gave at the Université catholique de Louvain on February 27, 1980) that these two systems are more closely related than was previously thought, since they share the same industrial revolution type imaginary: that of a rational society where man's welfare is materially measurable and infinitely improvable through the expansion of industries and advancements in science. In this respect Marx failed to understand that technology is not, as he claimed, the main drive of social change, since we have historical examples where societies possessing near identical technologies formed very different relations to them. An example given in the book is France and England during the industrial revolution with the second being much more liberal than the first.|$|E
2500|$|In the Roman Empire, the bestowal {{and use of}} clan {{and family}} names waxed and waned with changes in the various subcultures of the realm. (See Roman naming conventions.) The nomen, which was the gens name, was {{inherited}} much like last names are, but their purposes were quite different. [...] In later Europe, last names were developed to distinguish between individuals. [...] The nomen were to identify group kinship. [...] The praenomen was literally the [...] "forename" [...] and was originally used like a first name today. [...] In later times, praenomen became less useful for distinguishing individuals as it was often passed down for boys along with the nomen (like an entire culture where [...] "John Smith, Jr." [...] was the norm), and girls, were often given no praenomen at all or functional names like Major and Minor ("Older" [...] and [...] "Younger") or Maxima, Maio, and Mino ("Biggest," [...] "Middle," [...] "Littlest") or ordinal numbers rather than what <b>we</b> <b>might</b> <b>think</b> of as names: Prima, Secunda, Tertia, Quarta, etc. Around this time, the nomen became followed {{by one or more}} additional names called cognomen. [...] It became usual that one of these cognomen was inherited, but as the praenomen and nomen became ever more rigidly used and less useful for identifying individuals, additional personal cognomen were more often used, {{to the point that the}} first the praenomen and then the nomen fell out of use entirely. [...] With the gradual influence of Greek/Christian culture throughout the Empire, Christian religious names were sometimes put in front of traditional cognomen, but eventually, people reverted to single names. By the time of the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, family names were uncommon in the Eastern Roman Empire. In Western Europe, where Germanic culture dominated the aristocracy, family names were almost non-existent. They would not significantly reappear again in Eastern Roman society until the 10th century, apparently influenced by the familial affiliations of the Armenian military aristocracy. [...] The practice of using family names spread through the Eastern Roman Empire and gradually into Western Europe, although it was not until the modern era that family names came to be explicitly inherited as they are today.|$|E

60|$|From our {{consideration}} of the accelerated chest we see that a {{general theory of relativity}} must yield important results on the laws of gravitation. In point of fact, the systematic pursuit of the general idea of relativity has supplied the laws satisfied by the gravitational field. Before proceeding farther, however, I must warn the reader against a misconception suggested by these considerations. A gravitational field exists for the man in the chest, despite {{the fact that there was}} no such field for the co-ordinate system first chosen. Now <b>we</b> <b>might</b> easily suppose that the existence of a gravitational field is always only an apparent one. <b>We</b> <b>might</b> also <b>think</b> that, regardless of the kind of gravitational field which may be present, we could always choose another reference-body such that no gravitational field exists with reference to it. This is by no means true for all gravitational fields, but only for those of quite special form. It is, for instance, impossible to choose a body of reference such that, as judged from it, the gravitational field of the earth (in its entirety) vanishes.|$|R
40|$|Extract] The French {{sociologist}} Émile Durkheim once {{claimed that}} religion represents the "serious {{life of a}} society". This is a puzzling suggestion {{for those of us}} working in the secular academy. Was Durkheim implying that modern university scholars interested in culture and society are cut off from the serious life? Max Weber, a contemporary of Durkheim's, had a slightly different way of framing the issue. He believed that an intellectual culture that had eaten from the "tree of knowledge" would struggle to find meaning in modern everyday existence. He called this situation the "disenchantment of the world". In the closing pages of his landmark 1905 work, The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Weber suggested that the best that could come from a culture unable to access the sacred was a situation of "specialists without spirit, sensualists without heart". <b>We</b> moderns <b>might</b> <b>think</b> <b>we</b> are advanced; but in reality we have been robbed of the resources to lead what Weber terms a "satiated" life...|$|R
