60|$|Our {{version of}} the Bible is to be loved and prized for this, as for a {{thousand}} other things,--that it has preserved a purity of meaning to many terms of natural objects. Without this holdfast, our vitiated imaginations would refine away language to mere abstractions.

There after his tragic death came his old friend White, the journalist and novelist, under a promise, and found these papers; he found them to the extent of a crammed bureau, half a score of patent files quite distended and a writing-table drawer-full, and he was greatly exercised to find them.

If Black and White alternate making ko threats with recapturing the ko, they are having a ko fight.|$|R
