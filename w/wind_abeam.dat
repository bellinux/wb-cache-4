60|$|March 7. At Sea.--It is half-past {{six in the}} evening. We {{have just}} passed the Eddystone Lighthouse, with the <b>wind</b> <b>abeam.</b> The log {{registers}} ten knots an hour.|$|E
60|$|He {{hauled the}} sheet, {{but she would}} not bear the {{pressure}} when she brought the <b>wind</b> <b>abeam,</b> and seeing the water pouring in over her lowered side, Carnally let her fall off again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hold her up, Captain," [...] McCoy said {{as soon as}} {{he reached}} the poop. [...] "That's the easterly point of Fakarava, and we'll go in through the passage full-tilt, the <b>wind</b> <b>abeam,</b> and every sail drawing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “But it {{will serve}} {{only when we}} are sailing by the wind,” I explained. “When running more freely, with the <b>wind</b> astern <b>abeam,</b> or on the quarter, it will be {{necessary}} for me to steer.” ...|$|R
60|$|It {{was three}} in the afternoon, and the glass had sunk to 29:45, when the wind came. They could {{see it on the}} water, darkening the face of the sea, {{crisping}} tiny whitecaps as it rushed along. It was merely a stiff breeze, and the Uncle Toby, filling away under her storm canvas till the <b>wind</b> was <b>abeam,</b> sloshed along at a four-knot gait.|$|R
60|$|His {{voice was}} still ringing, {{and the men}} were just {{beginning}} to move in obedience, when the amidship deck of the Pyrenees, in a mass of flame and smoke, was flung upward into the sails and rigging, part of it remaining there and the rest falling into the sea. The <b>wind</b> being <b>abeam,</b> was what had saved the men crowded aft. They made a blind rush to gain the boats, but McCoy's voice, carrying its convincing message of vast calm and endless time, stopped them.|$|R
60|$|Grief {{watched the}} Willi-Waw haul up close, {{go out the}} passage, then slack its sheets as it headed south with the <b>wind</b> <b>abeam.</b> As it went out of sight past the point {{he could see the}} topsail being broken out. One of the Gooma boys, a black, nearly fifty years of age, hideously marred and scarred by skin {{diseases}} and old wounds, looked up into his face and grinned.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} require a {{mathematician}} to tell that much, sir. You will keep away, as soon as Bunting shows the signal, and bring the <b>wind</b> <b>abeam.</b> Never mind the braces; let them stand fast; as soon as we have passed the French admiral, I shall luff, again. This will cause us to lose a little of our weatherly position, but about that I am very indifferent. Give the order, sir--Bunting, run up the signal." ...|$|E
60|$|The night {{commenced}} favorably, the caravel struggling ahead {{through a}} tremendous sea that was sweeping {{down from the}} south, having the <b>wind</b> <b>abeam,</b> blowing so fresh as to cause the sails to be reduced within manageable size. The Niña was an excellent craft, as had been thoroughly proved, and she was now steadier than when first assailed by the tempests, her pilots having filled still more of the casks {{than they had been}} able to do during the late storm.|$|E
60|$|As the day wore along I {{improved}} on my obstructive tactics. When the Elsinore {{was up in}} the eye of the wind, {{and making}} sternway, I found that by putting the wheel sharply over, one way or the other, I could swing her bow off. Then, when she had paid off till the <b>wind</b> was <b>abeam,</b> by reversing the wheel hard across to the opposite hard-over I could take advantage of her momentum away from the wind and work her off squarely before it. This made all the wood-floated triangles of bird-snares tow aft along her sides.|$|R
60|$|Agatha {{understood}} what this meant. Thirlwell {{had missed the}} river mouth and meant to skirt the coast, but {{when he tried to}} do so the <b>wind</b> would be <b>abeam</b> and its power to heel the canoe largely increased. So far, they had run before the gale, but to bring the craft's side to it was a different thing.|$|R
6000|$|Impracticable Cape! You may {{approach}} it from this direction or that--in {{any way you}} please--from the East or from the West; with the <b>wind</b> astern, or <b>abeam,</b> or on the quarter; and still Cape Horn is Cape Horn. Cape Horn it is that takes the conceit out of fresh-water sailors, and steeps in a still salter brine the saltest. Woe betide the tyro; the fool-hardy, Heaven preserve! ...|$|R
60|$|Half an {{hour later}} the sheet was eased again, and the boat resumed her former course, as Godfrey saw that he should pass well ahead of the canoes coming out from the shore, and she moved faster with the <b>wind</b> <b>abeam</b> than she did close-hauled. Even while sitting down the canoes could be seen now. The natives were {{paddling}} their hardest, and the light craft danced {{over the surface of}} the water, which was now beginning to be ruffled by the breeze.|$|E
6000|$|... "There's lubberly {{work for}} you, Greenly!" [...] said Sir Gervaise, smiling. [...] "A {{commander-in-chief}} heading {{up with the}} bowlines dragged, and his second and third ahead--not to say fourth--running off with the <b>wind</b> <b>abeam!</b> Now, if we can knock the Comte off a couple of points, in passing, all his fellows astern will follow, and the Warspite and Blenheim and Thunderer will slip by like girls in a country-dance! Send Bury down to the main-deck, with orders to be ready with those eighteens." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{was a great}} {{satisfaction}} to him, for he felt that, if aught {{should happen}} to himself when on a voyage, Pengarvan could be trusted to bring the Swan home, as safely and surely as he could himself. Roger had, {{for the last two}} years, been going through the same schooling; but as yet he was very far from attaining accuracy, being unwilling to make sufficient allowance for the great leeway that a vessel, in those days, made with the <b>wind</b> <b>abeam.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{captain and}} Purvis, {{consulting}} {{the book of}} sailing directions, {{came to the conclusion}} that the passage via the Bermudas would be distinctly the best and shortest. The <b>wind</b> was <b>abeam</b> and steady, and with all sail set the Osprey maintained a speed of nine knots an hour until Bermuda was in sight. They were still undecided as to whether they had better go home by the mail, but it was settled for them by their finding, on entering the port, that the steamer had touched there the day before and gone on the same evening, and that it was not probable that any other steamer would be sailing for England for another ten days.|$|R
60|$|He turned suddenly, as {{he heard}} a {{flapping}} of canvas, and a few moments later, a tall dark shape emerged from the haze. At first, it had no clear outline, but Andrew {{knew it was the}} topsail of a cutter-rigged boat, beating in against the tide. She grew in distinctness until they could see her black hull washed by a streak of foam, and the straining mainsail, slanted away from them. The iron shoe of a trawl-beam projected between her shrouds, and the net hung in a dark festoon over her weather side. The <b>wind</b> was <b>abeam</b> just there and she passed them, sailing fast; but they waited, knowing that it would draw ahead where the channel curved. Presently, there was a banging of canvas that suddenly swung upright, and then filled and vanished on the other tack.|$|R
2500|$|On {{nearing the}} Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Slocum noted [...] "I didn't touch the helm, for {{with the current}} and heave of the sea the sloop found herself {{at the end of}} the run {{absolutely}} in the fairway of the channel. ... Then I trimmed her sails by the wind, took the helm, and flogged her up the couple of miles or so abreast the harbour landing, where I cast anchor at 3.30 pm, July 17, 1897, twenty-three days from Thursday Island. The distance run was twenty-seven hundred miles as the crow flies. ... During those twenty-three days I had not spent altogether more than three hours at the helm, including the time occupied in beating into Keeling harbour. I just lashed the helm and let her go; whether the <b>wind</b> was <b>abeam</b> or dead aft, it was all the same: she always stayed on her course." ...|$|R
60|$|When we hove to, a hasty though orderly {{confusion}} reigned. The boats came aboard {{from every}} side at once. As {{fast as the}} prisoners came over the rail they were marshalled forward to the forecastle by our hunters, while our sailors hoisted in the boats, pell-mell, dropping them anywhere upon the deck and not stopping to lash them. We were already under way, all sails set and drawing, and the sheets being slacked off for a <b>wind</b> <b>abeam,</b> as the last boat lifted clear {{of the water and}} swung in the tackles.|$|E
60|$|To Bob's great satisfaction, {{he found}} {{that he was able to}} eat his dinner with unimpaired appetite; {{although}} the Antelope was clear of the island, and was bowing deeply to a lively sea. The first mate--a powerful looking man of forty, who had lost one eye, and whose face was deeply seamed by an explosion of powder in an engagement with a French privateer--came down to the meal, while the second mate took the duty on deck. Bob found some difficulty in keeping his dish before him, for the Antelope was lying well over, with a northerly <b>wind</b> <b>abeam.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{mainsail}} looked remarkably big and heavy, and he {{was thankful}} {{that there was a}} reef in it, which made the task a little easier before he got it up. Then he spent several minutes in very hard work heaving the boat up to her anchor, and bruised his swollen hands in the determined effort it cost him to break it out. After that he set the jib and the sloop slid gently away with the <b>wind</b> <b>abeam</b> of her. He did not know exactly where she was going, but he shouted as loudly as he could every now and then, and at last there was a faint answering cry.|$|E
60|$|By {{the time}} sail could be {{shortened}} {{and the ship}} hauled close on a wind, the frigate was nearer half {{than a quarter of}} a mile off. We had to wait, therefore, until she could beat up to the place where we lay. This she soon did, making one stretch to the southward, until in a line with the boat, when she tacked, and came toward us, with her yards braced up, but having the <b>wind</b> nearly <b>abeam.</b> As she got within a cable's-length, both courses were hauled up and left hanging in the brails. Then the noble craft came rolling by us, in the trough, passing so near that we might be spoken. The old officer stood in the weather gangway, with a trumpet, and he hailed, when near enough to be heard. Instead of asking questions, to satisfy his own curiosity, he merely communicated his own intentions.|$|R
60|$|Once more I had the Dawn {{under my}} own orders; and, could I keep the frigate out of gun-shot, I cared very little for Mons. Le Gros. At first, the privateersmen {{supposed}} that, in filling away, I merely intended {{to further their}} views; but, no sooner did they perceive the ship standing on to leeward of the passage, than the truth seemed to flash on their befogged faculties. This {{was not until the}} depth of water was ascertained to be sufficient for their purposes; and such a flourishing of tarpaulins and greasy caps as succeeded, I had not witnessed for many a day. All these signals and calls, however, were disregarded; but away went the Dawn, with her yards just rounded in a point, with the <b>wind</b> fairly <b>abeam,</b> coasting along as near the islands as I thought it at all prudent to venture. As for the frigate, she was still keeping her luff, in order to get far enough to windward to make sure of her prey. At this moment, the two ships might have been a league asunder.|$|R
60|$|Smith was a {{carpenter}} by trade, {{which was probably}} the reason why he introduced this figure. Hazard saw the ice with regret; for {{he had hoped to}} work the schooner fairly out to sea in his watch; but the field was getting down through the passage in a way that threatened to cut off the exit of the two schooners from the bay. Daggett kept close in his wake, a proof that this experienced navigator in such waters saw no means to turn farther to windward. As the <b>wind</b> was now <b>abeam,</b> both vessels drove rapidly ahead; and in half an hour the northern point of the land they had so lately left came into view close aboard of them. Just then the moon rose, and objects became more clearly visible.|$|R
60|$|The harbor-clock chimed {{the quarter}} past eleven as I rode by it, and when I {{got down to}} the jetty there was no yacht to be seen. She had been cast off from her {{moorings}} ten minutes before eleven, and as the clock struck she had sailed out of the harbor. I would have followed in a boat, {{but it was a}} fine starlight night, with a fresh wind blowing, and the sailors on the pier laughed at me when I spoke of rowing after a schooner yacht which had got a quarter of an hour's start of us, with the <b>wind</b> <b>abeam</b> and the tide in her favor.|$|E
60|$|By and by, {{however, the}} point stood out close ahead. The {{trees on the}} summit bent in the wind; spray leaped about the bowlders where the white foam rolled. He must go round and find a landing to lee, but to go round he must cross the belt of {{breaking}} water, with the savage <b>wind</b> <b>abeam.</b> The canoe shipped some water, and riding in on a comber's crest, narrowly missed a rock that lifted its top for a moment out of the foam. Then Lister drove her in behind the point and helped Ruth to land on a gravel beach. Her eyes sparkled and he saw {{she had not been}} daunted.|$|E
60|$|But the Snark sailed. It was {{the only}} way she could get anywhere. She sailed for two years, and never touched rock, reef, nor shoal. She had no inside ballast, her iron keel weighed five tons, but her deep draught and high {{freeboard}} made her very stiff. Caught under full sail in tropic squalls, she buried her rail and deck many times, but stubbornly refused to turn turtle. She steered easily, and she could run day and night, without steering, close-by, full- and-by, and with the <b>wind</b> <b>abeam.</b> With the wind on her quarter and the sails properly trimmed, she steered herself within two points, and with the wind almost astern she required scarcely three points for self-steering.|$|E
6000|$|The gale {{was still}} blowing very fresh at south; {{and there were}} places in the river where its surface looked green and angry, though the wind had hardly sweep enough {{to raise the water}} into foam. The shape of the little island was nearly oval, and its greater length was from east to west. By keeping in the {{channels}} that washed it, in consequence of their several courses and of the direction of the gale, it would have been possible for a vessel to range past the island on either of its principal sides, and always to keep the <b>wind</b> very nearly <b>abeam.</b> These were the facts first noticed by Cap, and explained to his companion; for the hopes of both now rested on the chances of relief sent from Oswego. At this instant, while they stood gazing anxiously about them, Cap cried out, in his lusty, hearty manner, ...|$|R
60|$|The days pass, {{and nothing}} of moment happens. We get nowhere. The Elsinore, without the {{steadying}} of her canvas, rolls emptily and drifts a lunatic course. Sometimes she is bow {{on to the}} wind, {{and at other times}} she is directly before it; but at all times she is circling vaguely and hesitantly to get somewhere else than where she is. As an illustration, at daylight this morning she came up into the wind as if endeavouring to go about. In the course of half an hour she worked off till the <b>wind</b> was directly <b>abeam.</b> In another half hour she was back into the wind. Not until evening did she manage to get the wind on her port bow; but when she did, she immediately paid off, accomplished the complete circle in an hour, and recommenced her morning tactics of {{trying to get into the}} wind.|$|R
6000|$|So the Snark {{comes back}} on her course. The breath {{increases}} to a tiny puff. The Snark feels the weight of it and actually heels over a trifle. There is flying scud overhead, and I notice the stars being blotted out. Walls of darkness close in upon me, so that, when the last star is gone, the darkness is so near that it seems I can {{reach out and touch}} it on every side. When I lean toward it, I can feel it loom against my face. Puff follows puff, and I am glad the mizzen is furled. Phew! that was a stiff one! The Snark goes over and down until her lee-rail is buried and the whole Pacific Ocean is pouring in. Four or five of these gusts make me wish that the jib and flying-jib were in. The sea is picking up, the gusts are growing stronger and more frequent, and there is a splatter of wet in the air. There is no use in attempting to gaze to windward. The wall of blackness is within arm's length. Yet I cannot help attempting to see and gauge the blows that are being struck at the Snark. There is something ominous and menacing up there to windward, and I have a feeling that if I look long enough and strong enough, I shall divine it. Futile feeling. Between two gusts I leave the wheel and run forward to the cabin companionway, where I light matches and consult the barometer. [...] "29-90" [...] it reads. That sensitive instrument refuses to take notice of the disturbance which is humming with a deep, throaty voice in the rigging. I get back to the wheel just in time to meet another gust, the strongest yet. Well, anyway, the <b>wind</b> is <b>abeam</b> and the Snark is on her course, eating up easting. That at least is well.|$|R
60|$|Now {{they were}} running northwards with a fierce <b>wind</b> <b>abeam</b> of them, and the larger Spanish ship behind, but {{standing}} further out to sea to avoid the banks. Half an hour later the wind, which was gathering to a gale, shifted several points to the north, so that they must beat up against it under reefed canvas. Still they held on without accident, Foy attending to the sail and Martin steering. The Swallow was a good sea boat, and if their progress was slow so was that of their pursuer, which dogged them continually, sometimes a mile away and sometimes less. At length, towards evening, they caught sight of a ruined house that marked the channel of the little gut, one of the outlets of the Haarlem Mere.|$|E
60|$|The sudden {{check to}} the {{movement}} of the Cæsar brought the Dublin booming up in the darkness, when putting her helm up, that ship surged slowly past to leeward, resembling a black mountain moving by in the gloom. She was hailed and directed to heave-to, also, as soon as far enough ahead. The Elizabeth followed, clearing the flag-ship by merely twenty fathoms, and receiving a similar order. The Druid had been on the admiral's weather-quarter, but she now came gliding down, with the <b>wind</b> <b>abeam,</b> taking room to back her top-sail under the Cæsar's lee-bow. By this time a cutter was in the water, rising six or eight feet up the black side of the ship, and sinking as low apparently beneath her bottom. Next, Wycherly reported himself ready to proceed.|$|E
60|$|The Italians {{were cut}} off from the shore, which was fully a mile away at its nearest point. Did they attempt to make it, we could haul after them with the <b>wind</b> <b>abeam,</b> and {{overtake}} them before they had covered an eighth of the distance. But they were too wise to attempt it, contenting themselves with rowing lustily to windward along the starboard side of a big ship, the Lancashire Queen. But beyond the ship lay an open stretch of fully two miles to the shore in that direction. This, also, they dared not attempt, for we were bound to catch them before they could cover it. So, when they reached the bow of the Lancashire Queen, nothing remained but to pass around and row down her port side toward the stern, which meant rowing to leeward and giving us the advantage.|$|E
60|$|A {{suitable}} {{answer was}} returned, {{but as the}} ship is drawing ahead, we cannot follow her to relate it. The vessel that approached the third, was the Thunderer, Captain Foley. This {{was one of the}} ships that had received the fire of the three leading French vessels, after they had brought the <b>wind</b> <b>abeam,</b> and being the leading vessel of the English rear, she had suffered more than any other of the British squadron. The fact was apparent, as she approached, by the manner in which her rigging was knotted, and the attention that had been paid to her spars. Even as she closed, the men were on the yard bending a new main-course, the old one having been hit on the bolt-rope, and torn nearly from the spar. There were also several plugs on her lee-side to mark the spots where the French guns had told.|$|E
60|$|Somewhat restless {{under the}} extent of his responsibility, Nat was on deck several times during the night. There was, however, no sign of change. The Arrow was still {{stealing}} through the water with the <b>wind</b> <b>abeam.</b> The two midshipmen, equally impressed with the responsibility of being in command of a watch, were on the alert, and the look-out was vigilant. The wind freshened again when the sun rose. At noon there were white-heads on the water, and the schooner, heeling over a bit now, was doing nearly nine knots. The three officers all took an observation, and to their satisfaction found that they were within half a mile of each other. At the present moment, however, there was no doubt as to their situation, for the high land near Cape Dame Marie lay clearly in sight over the bowsprit, while behind them the hills over Morant Point lay like a dim haze.|$|E
60|$|The frigate {{was on an}} easy bow-line, or, {{to speak}} more correctly, was {{standing}} directly across our fore-foot, with her yards nearly square. In a very few minutes, each keeping her present course, the two ships would have passed within pistol-shot of each other. I scarce knew {{the nature of the}} sudden impulse which induced me to call out to the man at the wheel to starboard his helm. It was probably from instinctive apprehension that it were better for a neutral to have as little to do with a belligerent as possible, mingled with a presentiment that I might lose some of my people by impressment. Call out I certainly did, and the Dawn's bows came up to the wind, looking to the westward, or in a direction contrary to that in which the frigate was running, as her yards were square, or nearly so. As soon as the weather leeches touched, the helm was righted, and away we went with the <b>wind</b> <b>abeam,</b> with about as much breeze as we wanted for the sail we carried.|$|E
