40|$|The selenium, an {{essential}} nutrient and potentially toxic element to {{human and animal}} health, is widely used in agriculture and medicine. Soil is the transitional zone through which selenium entered into groundwater. Therefore, the transport of selenium through porous soil is of great environment concern, which is not well understood. The transport of selenite in loessial soil columns was studied using a miscible displacement technique under various flow rates and influent concentrations in this paper. A mathematical model based on one-dimensional convection-dispersion equation was formulated to describe the selenium transport. The breakthrough curves with and <b>without</b> <b>tracers</b> were fitted by using the computer program "studio of analytical models". The {{results showed that the}} method without tracer was more accurate than the method with the tracer. Studio of analytical models is a very flexible tool for approximate analysis of one dimensional solute transport problems in soil. The method of parameter estimation using convection-dispersion equation accurately defined the dispersion coefficient and retardation factor from the breakthrough curves and modeled selenite transport through soil. These results suggest that deterministic equilibrium convection-dispersion equation can accurately simulate the breakthrough curves of Se transport in saturated soil and the selection of tracer ions should be cautious when studying the transport of different chemicals...|$|E

40|$|Sowohl in der Natur als auch in der Industrie existieren thermisch induzierte Strömungen. Von Interesse für diese Forschungsarbeit sind dabei die Konvektionen im Erdmantel sowie in den Glasschmelzwannen. Der dort stattfindende Materialtransport resultiert aus Unterschieden in der Dichte, der Temperatur und der chemischen Konzentration innerhalb des konvektierenden Materials. Um das Verständnis für die ablaufenden Prozesse zu verbessern, werden von zahlreichen Forschergruppen numerische Modellierungen durchgeführt. Die Verifikation der dafür verwendeten Algorithmen erfolgt meist über die Analyse von Laborexperimenten. Im Vordergrund dieser Forschungsarbeit steht die Entwicklung einer Methode zur Bestimmung der dreidimensionalen Temperaturverteilung für die Untersuchung von thermisch induzierten Strömungen in einem Versuchsbecken. Eine direkte Temperaturmessung im Inneren des Versuchs{{materials}} bzw. der Glasschmelze beeinflusst allerdings das Strömungsverhalten. Deshalb wird die geodynamisch störungsfrei arbeitende Impedanztomographie verwendet. Die Grundlage dieser Methode bildet der erweiterte Arrhenius-Zusammenhang zwischen Temperatur und spezifischer elektrischer Leitfähigkeit. Während der Laborexperimente wird ein zähflüssiges Polyethylenglykol-Wasser-Gemisch in einem Becken von unten her erhitzt. Die auf diese Weise generierten Strömungen stellen unter Berücksichtigung der Skalierung ein Analogon sowohl zu dem Erdmantel als auch zu den Schmelzwannen dar. Über mehrere Elektroden, die an den Beckenwänden installiert sind, erfolgen die geoelektrischen Messungen. Nach der sich anschließenden dreidimensionalen Inversion der elektrischen Widerstände liegt das Modell mit der Verteilung der spezifischen elektrischen Leitfähigkeit im Inneren des Versuchsbeckens vor. Diese wird mittels der erweiterten Arrhenius-Formel in eine Temperaturverteilung umgerechnet. Zum Nachweis der Eignung dieser Methode für die nichtinvasive Bestimmung der dreidimensionalen Temperaturverteilung wurden mittels mehrerer Thermoelemente an den Beckenwänden zusätzlich direkte Temperaturmessungen durchgeführt und die Werte miteinander verglichen. Im Wesentlichen sind die Innentemperaturen gut rekonstruierbar, wobei die erreichte Messgenauigkeit von der räumlichen und zeitlichen Auflösung der Gleichstromgeoelektrik abhängt. Many natural bodies {{such as the}} Earth’s mantle, as well as materials inside industrial installations like {{molten glass}} inside furnaces, exchange matter through convection resulting from differences in temperature, density and chemical concentration. In Earth Sciences the analysis of plumes and convection inside the Earth’s mantle is a classical area for numerical modelling. However, experimental methods in the laboratory help as analogue models to verify the validity of computer models. The inherent problem of such analogue experiments is the visualisation of the flows and {{the determination of the}} parameters of interest as for example temperature. In nature and in industrial installations it is difficult to measure the temperature inside the object of interest directly. Therefore, the goal of this research study was {{the development of a new}} method for temperature measurements that allows temperature data acquisition without influencing the flow pattern in the laboratory simulation of Earth’s convection. Contrary to the three-dimensional optical techniques used by some of the scientist, DC-geoelectrical 3 -D tomography works <b>without</b> <b>tracers</b> inside fluids. This is the precondition for the determination of temperatures inside molten glass, that has to remain uncontaminated. The basis for the use of DC-geoelectrical 3 -D tomography is the adjusted Arrhenius temperature dependence of the electrical conductivity. In order to verify the applicability of the method, thermally driven flows were generated in a viscous material. Therefor, dissolved polymer polyethylene glycol was heated in a tank with a base of 48 x 30 cm and a height of 30 cm. During each geoelectrical measurement, two electrodes supplied a current into the tank to generate an electrical field. The further 26 electrodes, placed on the sides of the tank, contemporaneously recorded the voltages between themselves and the reference electrode. Finally, the voltages were inverted using a 3 -D inversion program. The model of the three-dimensional distribution of electrical conductivities obtained was converted into temperatures. In order to verify the validity of the method these temperatures were compared with the temperatures recorded by the 29 thermocouples on the sides of the tank. There were high positive correlations between the temperatures measured directly and the temperatures determined by geoelectrical 3 -D tomography. This, as well as the low root mean square deviations normalised to the mean of the temperatures of the respective geoelectrical model demonstrates the success of the new method presented in this thesis. It should be noted that small-sized structures such as hot plumes with a diameter of 3 cm possess lower temperatures in the reconstructed models than in reality because of the relatively low spatial resolution. This means that geoelectrical 3 -D tomography can be used for the measurement of the general distribution of temperature, but not for analysis of small structures. A goal for the glass industry is to control flows in furnaces, because the molten basic elements for glass production have to be ideally homogenised with low energy usage. For this purpose the determination of the three-dimensional distribution of temperature is a basic prerequisite. However, the high temperature of the glass itself makes it impractical to measure the properties of the flows in situ. Therefore, the glass industry is interested in this non-invasive method and first measurements were carried out in a smelting furnace. The glass temperatures determined by geoelectrical 3 -D tomography strongly diverged from the temperatures of the thermocouples on the sides of the furnace. Although the removal of the highest proportion of the electrical disturbances improved the results of inversion, a substantial error still remained. Furthermore, the spatial resolution was relatively low. In order to increase the resolution more data and additional electrodes on the walls would be required, however the geoelectrical measurements would take significantly longer. In addition, there is a limit to the number of electrodes that can be installed. Due to the low spatial resolution and the remaining substantial errors, geoelectrical tomography is unsuitable for application at glass smelting furnaces with the present state of technology...|$|E

There was no tracer pooling in the biliary tree although no bowel activity was observed, even on delayed images. The association of persistent blood pool activity, bile duct visualization <b>without</b> <b>tracer</b> pooling, and nonvisualization of the bowel was caused by a continuous recirculation of the tracer from the biliary tree into the bloodstream.

40|$|Convection {{does not}} govern plasma to dialysate {{transport}} of protein. The dependence of protein clearance on molecular size during peritoneal dialysis {{can be explained}} by assuming that either convection or diffusion is the major mechanism governing plasma to dialysate transport of protein. If convection is the predominant transport mechanism, then plasma-to-dialysate transport rates for protein should not decrease when the protein concentration in the instilled dialysis solution is increased. In the present study, plasma-to-dialysate transport rates for fluorescein-labeled protein tracers, α-lactalbumin and immunoglobulin G (IgG), were determined during a six hour isotonic exchange (25 ml/kg) in New Zealand White rabbits. The protein tracers were continuously infused into the bloodstream to keep plasma concentrations relatively constant, and transperitoneal transport rates were determined either with or <b>without</b> <b>tracer</b> protein added to the instilled dialysis solution. Plasma-to-dialysate transport rates were greater for α-lactalbumin than for IgG as expected based on the molecular size of these proteins.

Due to the time consuming and costly chemical analyses, exposure levels are measured at best on a daily basis. These infrequent determinations may not detect variability in toxicant concentrations {{that could result in}} test failures. To minimize repetitive testing and improve data quality, a dye tracer method was evaluated. Rhodamine WT was selected as a toxicant tracer because of easy detectability, low toxicity to aquatic organisms, and negligible transformation in the aquatic environment. Results over a 24 h period showed that rhodamine reliably predicted the toxicant (diquat) concentrations with an r value of 0. 99.

From these findings it is concluded that dye tracers are suitable toxicant surrogates.

Prior to the experiment, a tracer test was performed to characterize the initial flow and transport properties of the rock around the experimental boreholes. This study reports on the model interpretation of tracer test 09 - 03. The calculations were performed by means of a two-dimensional model (homogeneous fracture plane including 3 boreholes) using the Retraso-CodeBright software package. In the tracer test, Grimsel groundwater containing the tracer (uranine) was circulated in the emplacement borehole during 43 days (zero injection flow rate). Circulation continued <b>without</b> <b>tracer</b> afterwards. Water was extracted at the observation and extraction boreholes.

Scintigraphy was performed using a ‘hybrid’ g-camera that allows simultaneous acquisition of SPECT and CT images, with interesting results in diagnostic oncology. Materials and methods. Between September 2003 and August 2004, 23 patients with a solitary pulmonary nodule detected on CT underwent SPECT-CT using Tc- 99 m Sestamibi as a radiotracer. Nodules with positive scintigraphy were immediately subjected to biopsy or surgical resection. Nodules with negative scintigraphy were followed up after 3 – 4 months by MSCT with automatic segmentation software (Advanced Lung Analysis, ALA) and histological characterisation. Results. Of the 23 nodules (size range 0. 8 – 2 cm) discovered with MSCT, 11 showed intense uptake of Tc- 99 m Sestamibi. Ten lesions were true positive: seven adenocarcinomas, one squamous cell carcinoma, one large cell carcinoma and one metastasis.

40|$|Retardation {{of nuclear}} {{contaminants}} in rock matrices {{can lead to}} long retention times, allowing substantial radionuclide decay prior to eventual release. Imbibition and diffusion into the rock matrix can move contaminants away from an active fracture, thereby contributing to their retardation. However, diffusive transport in some rocks may behave anomalously because of their sparsely connected porespace, in contrast to diffusion in rocks with denser pore connections. We examined imbibition of weakly sorbing tracers into welded tuff and Indiana sandstone, and water imbibition into metagraywacke and Berea sandstone. Tuff samples were initially equilibrated to 12 % and 76 % water (v/v) within controlled humidity chambers, while the other rocks were air-dried. For imbibition, one face was exposed to water, with or <b>without</b> <b>tracer,</b> and uptake was measured over time. Following imbibition, tracer concentration measurements were made at fine (1 mm) increments. Three anomalous results were observed: (1) Indiana sandstone and metagraywacke showed mass of imbibed water scaling as time{sup 0. 26 }, while tuff and Berea sandstone showed the more classical scaling with time{sup 0. 05 }; (2) tracer movement into dry (2 % initial saturation) Indiana sandstone showed a dispersion pattern similar to that expected during tracer movement into moist (76 % initial saturation) tuft and (3) tracer concentrations at the inlet face of the tuff sample were approximately twice those deeper inside the sample. The experiment was then modeled using random walk methods on a 3 -D lattice with different values of pore coordination. Network model simulations that used a pore coordination of 1. 49 for Indiana sandstone and 1. 56 for metagraywacke showed similar temporal scaling, {{a result of their}} porespace being close to the percolation threshold. Tracer concentration profiles in Indiana sandstone and tuff were closely matched by simulations that used pore coordinations of 1. 49 and 1. 68, respectively, because of how low connectivity alters the accessible porosity {{in the vicinity of the}} inlet face.

The model relates these three phases to a biological understanding of the system, as well as the logical premise that the homeostatic mechanisms will maintain very tight control of the system. It includes states for insulin, glucose, insulin action and a state to simulate an integral function of glucose. Structural identifiability analysis was performed on the model to determine whether a unique set of parameter values could be identified from the available observations, which should permit meaningful conclusions to be drawn from parameter estimation.

The (stellar) mass dependent halo profile links together the local and global properties of the halo (e. g. inner slope and M_ halo) which allows for measurements of M_ halo <b>without</b> virial <b>tracers.</b> We compile a large sample of rotation curves from the literature to test this halo profile. We find that this halo profile can explain rotation curve observations {{over a wide range}} of M_. However, the global results from our sample are inconsistent with a Λ cold dark matter universe. We do not find the expected correlation between the halo concentration and M_ halo and there is significantly larger scatter than expected. Furthermore, a large portion of galaxies below M_∼ 10 ^ 9 M_ are found to be hosted by smaller halos than expectations from the abundance matching technique. We find our results are robust to statistical priors and systematic effects such as inclination angle, asymmetric drift correction, data source, and uncertainties in stellar mass-to-light ratios.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to improve temporal coherence in Monte Carlo renderings of animation sequences. Unlike other approaches that exploit temporal coherence in a post-process, our technique does so already during sampling. Building on previous gradient-domain rendering techniques that sample finite differences over the image plane, we introduce temporal finite differences and formulate a corresponding 3 D spatio-temporal screened Poisson reconstruction problem that is solved over windowed batches of several frames simultaneously. We further extend our approach to include second order, mixed spatio-temporal differences, an improved technique to compute temporal differences exploiting motion vectors, and adaptive sampling. Our algorithm can be built on a gradient-domain path <b>tracer</b> <b>without</b> large modifications. In particular, we do not require the ability to evaluate animation paths over multiple frames. We demonstrate that our approach effectively reduces temporal flickering in animation sequences, significantly improving the visual quality compared to both path tracing and gradient-domain rendering of individual frames...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{examines}} the mass balance in calculations with the Regional Atmospheric Modelling System (RAMS). An error is {{pointed out that}} concerns the calcula-tion of the surface fluxes on slopes. This error affects all the prognostic variables in RAMS when sloping terrain is involved. Here we explain how the error can be corrected. To study {{the impact of the}} error, we compared simulations with the uncorrected and corrected model. The model contains CO 2 transport, and online mass balance calculations were performed for this <b>tracer.</b> <b>Without</b> correction, effective surface CO 2 -fluxes on mountain slopes were found to be enhanced under certain common conditions to several times the parameterized fluxes. Neglecting this error may cause substantial deviations in both forward and inverse model calculations. After the correction a very good closure of the mass balance is obtained. The correction also modifies the meteorological parameters, although the consequences were limited compared to the CO 2 -fluxes...|$|R
40|$|In this fluid {{dynamics}} video, we demonstrate the microscale mixing enhancement of passive tracer particles in suspensions of swimming microalgae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. These biflagellated, single-celled eukaryotes (10 micron diameter) swim with a "breaststroke" pulling motion of their flagella at speeds of about 100 microns/s and exhibit heterogeneous trajectory shapes. Fluorescent tracer particles (2 micron diameter) {{allowed us to}} quantify the enhanced mixing caused by the swimmers, which is relevant to suspension feeding and biogenic mixing. <b>Without</b> swimmers present, <b>tracer</b> particles diffuse slowly due solely to Brownian motion. As the swimmer concentration is increased, the probability density functions (PDFs) of tracer displacements develop strong exponential tails, and the Gaussian core broadens. High-speed imaging (500 Hz) of tracer-swimmer interactions demonstrates the importance of flagellar beating in creating oscillatory flows that exceed Brownian motion out to about 5 cell radii from the swimmers. Finally, we also show evidence of possible cooperative motion and synchronization between swimming algal cells. Comment: 1 page, APS-DFD 2009 Gallery of Fluid Motio...|$|R
40|$|Measuring insulin {{sensitivity}} {{during the}} physiological milieu of oral glucose perturbation, e. g., a meal or an oral glucose tolerance test, {{would be extremely}} valuable but difficult since the rate of appearance of absorbed glucose is unknown. The reference method is a tracer two-step one: first, the rate of appearance of glucose (R(a meal) (ref)) is reconstructed by employing the tracer-to-tracee ratio clamp technique with two tracers and a model of non-steady-state glucose kinetics; next, this R(a meal) (ref) is used as the known input of a model describing insulin action on glucose kinetics to estimate insulin sensitivity (SI(ref)). Recently, a nontracer method based on the oral minimal model (OMM) has been proposed to estimate simultaneously the above quantities, denoted R(a meal) and SI, respectively, from plasma glucose and insulin concentrations measured after an oral glucose perturbation. This last method has obvious advantages over the tracer method, but its domain of validity has never been assessed against a reference method. It is thus important to establish {{whether or not the}} "nontracer" R(a meal) and SI compare well with the "tracer" R(a meal) (ref) and SI(ref). We do this comparison on a database of 88 subjects, and it is very satisfactory: R(a meal) profiles agree well with the R(a meal) (ref) and correlation of SI(ref) with SI is r = 0. 86 (P < 0. 0001). We conclude that OMM candidates as a reliable tool to measure both the rate of glucose absorption and insulin sensitivity from oral glucose tests <b>without</b> employing <b>tracers...</b>|$|R
30|$|Qualitative {{analysis}} {{was based on}} visual assessment of the PET/CT scans. Two nuclear medicine physicians evaluated the scans on transaxial, coronal, and sagittal images independently from each other. In the case of 18 F-FDG PET/CT, bone marrow and skeletal foci presenting with tracer uptake {{higher than that of}} the surrounding background, for which another benign etiology was excluded, were considered indicative for myeloma. Four patterns of 18 F-FDG distribution were identified on PET/CT scans: (a) negative pattern, <b>without</b> any pathological <b>tracer</b> accumulation indicative for MM involvement; (b) focal pattern, in which bone marrow foci of increased 18 F-FDG uptake were considered MM lesions; (c) diffuse pattern, with an “intense,” diffuse bone marrow tracer uptake in maximum intensity projection (MIP) images, without any 18 F-FDG avid focal lesions; and (d) a mixed pattern, with a combination of diffuse bone marrow uptake and focal bone marrow lesions [17]. Regarding 18 F-FLT PET/CT, focal skeletal sites with a tracer uptake higher than that of the surrounding background were also defined as indicative for myeloma. All PET-positive findings were compared with the underlying low-dose CT findings.|$|R
