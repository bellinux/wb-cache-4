40|$|Abstract Is nanotechnology-based human {{enhancement}} morally permissible? One {{reason to}} question such enhancement {{stems from a}} concern for preserving our species. It is harder than one might think, however, to explain what could be <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> altering <b>our</b> own species. One possibility is {{to turn to the}} environmental ethics literature. Perhaps some of the arguments for preserving other species can be applied against nanotechnology-based human enhancements that alter human nature. This paper critically examines the case for using two of the strongest arguments in the environmental ethics literature to show that nanotechnology-based human enhancements are impermissible: 1) Our species, like many other naturally occurring species, has aestheti...|$|R
40|$|There {{is no one}} {{universal}} {{definition of}} Justice. Such a limited view of right and <b>wrong</b> conflicts <b>with</b> <b>our</b> infinitely diverse world. The key to a harmonious global community is that justice is malleable and fluid, similar to water, where it can take the shape of its environment while still retaining the properties of fundamental rights. Our world will never come to a universal agreement on justice, due to the deeply embedded cultural beliefs and differing views, so a single understanding of justice is impossible. If the world can have a baseline understanding {{of right and wrong}} and the flexibility to understand different perspectives, although we may never totally achieve it, we may pursue the ultimate understanding of Justice...|$|R

2500|$|Shortly after 16:26, a salvo struck on {{or around}} , which was {{obscured}} by spray and smoke from shell bursts.

[...] Beatty famously turned to his flag captain, saying [...] "Chatfield, {{there seems to be}} something <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> bloody ships today." [...] (In popular legend, Beatty also immediately ordered his ships to [...] "turn two points to port", i.e., two points nearer the enemy, but there is no official record of any such command or course change.)

If a child's talent cannot blossom the way it should, {{that is not the}} child's fault, but {{the school}} system and the {{environment}} he lives in.

When something is <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> car, our watch or our house, we call a professional to fix it. No one wants to repair these himself. In modern society, {{it is not enough to}} love the children. No seed will become a flower just because it gets love. It also needs professional care and nursing to bloom. So if we do not nurse and protect the child's talent, he will become a gloomy adult and the whole world will be poorer.

2500|$|During the First World War Chatfield {{was present}} as Beatty's Flag-Captain in the Lion at the Battle of Heligoland Bight in August 1914, at the Battle of Dogger Bank in January 1915 {{and at the}} Battle of Jutland in May 1916. It was at Jutland, after two British battlecruisers had blown up, that Beatty made his famous remark, [...] "There seems to be {{something}} <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> bloody ships today, Chatfield". Appointed to the Order of St Michael and St George as a Companion on 31 May 1916 and to the Order of the Bath as a Companion in the 1916 Birthday Honours, Chatfield went on to command the battleship HMS Iron Duke, Beatty's flagship as Commander-in-Chief of the Grand Fleet, in November 1916 and then the battleship , Beatty's new flagship in the same role, in February 1917. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George on 5 April 1919.|$|E
2500|$|Admiral of the Fleet David Richard Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty [...] (17 January 1871 – 11 March 1936) was a Royal Navy officer. After {{serving in}} the Mahdist War and then the {{response}} to the Boxer Rebellion, he commanded the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron at the Battle of Jutland in 1916, a tactically indecisive engagement after which his aggressive approach was contrasted with the caution of his commander Admiral Sir John Jellicoe. He is remembered for his comment at Jutland that [...] "There seems to be something <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> bloody ships today", after two of his ships exploded. Later in the war he succeeded Jellicoe as Commander in Chief of the Grand Fleet, in which capacity he received the surrender of the German High Seas Fleet {{at the end of the}} war. He then followed Jellicoe's path a second time, serving as First Sea Lord—a position that Beatty held longer (7 years 9 months) than any other First Sea Lord in history. [...] While First Sea Lord, he was involved in negotiating the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 in which it was agreed that the United States, Britain and Japan should set their navies in a ratio of 5:5:3, with France and Italy maintaining smaller ratio fleets of 1.75 each.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Standard Bayesian {{inference}} can behave suboptimally if {{the model}} is wrong. We present a modification of Bayesian inference which continues to achieve good rates <b>with</b> <b>wrong</b> models. <b>Our</b> method adapts the Bayesian learning rate to the data, picking the rate minimizing the cumulative loss of sequential prediction by posterior randomization. Our results {{can also be used}} to adapt the learning rate in a PAC-Bayesian context. The results are based on an extension of an inequality due to T. Zhang and others to dependent random variables. ...|$|R
40|$|No {{one wants}} to be treated like an object, {{regarded}} as an item of property, or put up for sale. Yet many people frame personal autonomy in terms of self-ownership, representing themselves as property owners with the right to do as they wish with their bodies. Others do not use the language of property, but are similarly insistent on the rights of free individuals to decide for themselves whether to engage in commercial transactions for sex, reproduction, or organ sales. Drawing on analyses of rape, surrogacy, and markets in human organs, Our Bodies, Whose Property? challenges notions of freedom based on ownership of our bodies and argues against the normalization of markets in bodily services and parts. Anne Phillips explores the risks associated with metaphors of property and the reasons why the commodification of the body remains problematic. What, she asks, is <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> thinking of oneself as the owner of one's body? What is <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> making <b>our</b> bodies available for rent or sale? What, if anything, is the difference between markets in sex, reproduction, or human body parts, and the other markets we commonly applaud? Phillips contends that body markets occupy the outer edges of a continuum that is, in some way, a feature of all labor markets. But she also emphasizes that we all have bodies, and considers the implications of this otherwise banal fact for equality. Bodies remind us of shared vulnerability, alerting us to the common experience of living as embodied beings in the same world. Examining the complex issue of body exceptionalism, Our Bodies, Whose Property? demonstrates that treating the body as property makes human equality harder to comprehend...|$|R

40|$|Motivated by the {{apparent}} {{failure of the}} credit multiplier mechanism (CM) to deliver amplification in DSGE models, we re-examine its role in business cycles to address the question: is something <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the CM? <b>Our</b> answer is no. In coming to this answer we construct a model with reproducible capital and collateral constraints within two setups, a closed and a small open economy. Our results from the first model do not differ from the ones of previous papers. However, our main finding {{is that it is}} not the CM what fails in this type of models, but rather their ability to produce sufficient variability in prices. In particular, in this model, general equilibrium dynamics counteract the logic of price fluctuations described by theoretical models thus preventing the CM from being triggered. The second model allows us to confirm our previous claim: absent general equilibrium effects, when feeding the model with exogenous asset price dynamics, the CM is indeed an effective amplifying mechanism of shocks into the economy...|$|R
40|$|Humans {{critically}} {{depend on}} the adequate design of productive ecosystems. With every design comes trade-offs. Agriculture is a clear case in point. We currently produce more than enough food for everyone on the planet but at a severe environmental cost. The degradation of our environment in turn threatens the long-term security of crop production. This negative feedback cycle suggests there is something <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> the way <b>our</b> current human engineered ecosystems are designed. One striking feature of current industrial designs {{is that they are}} incredibly simple: monocultures, founded on reductionist ideas of how ecosystems operate. This thesis explores the challenges and opportunities we face with adding complexity back into the design of ecosystems. The worldâs first database on interspecific plant-soil feedback experiments is created and used to test theory on temporally lagged plant competition and facilitation. New concepts on the selection of competitive strength across trophic levels and its contrasting effects on population versus community level productivity are elucidated. The need to consider local management of diversified ecosystems in the context of global drivers of ecosystem change is validated. </p...|$|R
40|$|The common random string model {{introduced}} by Blum, Feldman and Micali permits {{the construction of}} cryptographic protocols that are provably impossible to realize in the standard model. We can think of this model as a trusted party generating a random string and giving it to all parties in the protocol. However, the introduction of such a third party should set alarm bells going off: Who is this trusted party? Why should we trust that the string is random? Even if the string is uniformly random, {{how do we know}} it does not leak private information to the trusted party? The very point of doing cryptography in the first place is to prevent us from trusting the <b>wrong</b> people <b>with</b> <b>our</b> secrets. In this paper, we propose the more realistic multi-string model. Instead of having one trusted authority, we have several authorities that generate random strings. We do not trust any single authority; we only assume a majority of them generate random strings honestly. This security model is reasonable, {{yet at the same time}} it is very easy to implement. We could for instance imagine random strings being provided on the Internet, and any set of parties that want to execute a protocol just need to agree on which authorities’ strings they want to use. We demonstrate the use of the multi-string model in several fundamental cryptographic tasks. W...|$|R

60|$|Now this {{abundance}} {{of colors and}} loss of a color scheme is a pretty perfect parable {{of all that is}} <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> modern ideals and especially with our modern education. It is the same with ethical education, economic education, every sort of education. The growing London child will find no lack of highly controversial teachers who will teach him that geography means painting the map red; that economics means taxing the foreigner, that patriotism means the peculiarly un-English habit of flying a flag on Empire Day. In mentioning these examples specially I do not mean to imply that there are no similar crudities and popular fallacies upon the other political side. I mention them because they constitute a very special and arresting feature of the situation. I mean this, that there were always Radical revolutionists; but now there are Tory revolutionists also. The modern Conservative no longer conserves. He is avowedly an innovator. Thus all the current defenses of the House of Lords which describe it as a bulwark against the mob, are intellectually done for; the bottom has fallen out of them; because on five or six of the most turbulent topics of the day, the House of Lords is a mob itself; and exceedingly likely to behave like one.|$|E
60|$|Our Western {{civilization is}} built upon assumptions, which, to a psychologist, are rationalizings of {{excessive}} energy. Our industrialism, our militarism, our love of progress, our missionary zeal, our imperialism, our passion for dominating and organizing, all spring from a superflux of the itch for activity. The creed of efficiency {{for its own}} sake, without regard for the ends {{to which it is}} directed, has become somewhat discredited in Europe since the war, which would have never taken place if the Western nations had been slightly more indolent. But in America this creed is still almost universally accepted; so it is in Japan, and so it is by the Bolsheviks, who have been aiming fundamentally at the Americanization of Russia. Russia, like China, may be described as an artist nation; but unlike China it has been governed, since the time of Peter the Great, by men who wished to introduce all the good and evil of the West. In former days, I might have had no doubt that such men were in the right. Some (though not many) of the Chinese returned students resemble them in the belief that Western push and hustle are the most desirable things on earth. I cannot now take this view. The evils produced in China by indolence seem to me far less disastrous, {{from the point of view}} of mankind at large, than those produced throughout the world by the domineering cocksureness of Europe and America. The Great War showed that something is <b>wrong</b> <b>with</b> <b>our</b> civilization; experience of Russia and China has made me believe that those countries can help to show us what it is that is wrong. The Chinese have discovered, and have practised for many centuries, a way of life which, if it could be adopted by all the world, would make all the world happy. We Europeans have not. Our way of life demands strife, exploitation, restless change, discontent and destruction. Efficiency directed to destruction can only end in annihilation, and it is to this consummation that our civilization is tending, if it cannot learn some of that wisdom for which it despises the East.|$|E
