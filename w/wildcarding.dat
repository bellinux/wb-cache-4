5000|$|<b>Wildcards</b> in the DNS {{are much}} more limited than other <b>wildcard</b> {{characters}} used in other computer systems. <b>Wildcard</b> DNS records have a single [...] "*" [...] (asterisk) as the leftmost DNS label, such as *.example.com. Asterisks at {{other places in the}} domain will not work as a <b>wildcard,</b> so neither *abc.example.com nor abc.*.example.com work as <b>wildcard</b> DNS records. Moreover, the <b>wildcard</b> is matched only when a domain does not exist, not just when there are no matching records of the type that has been queried for. Even the definition of [...] "does not exist" [...] as defined in the search algorithm of [...] section 4.3.2 can result in the <b>wildcard</b> not matching cases that one might expect with other types of <b>wildcards.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The first Unix shell was the Thompson shell, sh, {{written by}} Ken Thompson at Bell Labs and {{distributed}} with Versions 1 through 6 of Unix, from 1971 to 1975.

50|$|A Unix {{shell is}} a {{command-line}} interpreter or shell {{that provides a}} traditional Unix-like command line user interface.

Users typically interact with a Unix shell using a terminal emulator, however, direct operation via serial hardware connections, or networking session, are common for server systems.

5000|$|... rm can be overlain by a C shell alias or Bourne shell {{function}} of [...] "rm -i" [...] {{so as to}} avoid accidental deletion of files. If a user still wishes to delete a large number of files without confirmation, they can manually cancel out the -i argument by adding the -f option (as the option specified later on the expanded command line [...] "rm -i -f" [...] takes precedence). Unfortunately this approach generates dangerous habits towards the use of <b>wildcarding,</b> leading to its own version of accidental removals.|$|E

50|$|Giving {{the shell}} the {{responsibility}} for interpreting wildcards was an important decision on Unix. It meant that wildcards would work with every command, and always in the same way. However, the decision relied on Unixs ability to pass long argument lists efficiently through the exec system call that csh uses to execute commands. By contrast, on Windows, wildcard interpretation is conventionally performed by each application. This is a legacy of MS-DOS, which only allowed a 128-byte command line to be passed to an application, making <b>wildcarding</b> by the DOS command prompt impractical. Although modern Windows can pass command lines of up to roughly 32K Unicode characters, the burden for wildcard interpretation remains with the application.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Netalyzr is {{a widely}} used network {{measurement}} and diagnosis tool. To date, it has collected 198, 000 measurement sessions from 146, 000 distinct IP addresses. One of the primary focus areas of Netalyzr is DNS behavior, including DNS resolver properties, common name lookups, NXDOMAIN <b>wildcarding,</b> lookup performance, and on-the-wire manipulations. Additional tests detect and categorize the behavior of any DNS proxies in the users ’ gateways or firewalls. In this paper we report on DNS-specific insights from Netalyzr’s growing dataset. We identify significant problems in the existing DNS infrastructure, including unreliability of IP-level fragmentation, several kinds of result <b>wildcarding,</b> surprisingly poor lookup performance, and deliberate in-path DNS message manipulations. As these observations affect implementers of the DNS protocol as well as developers using common DNS APIs, we offer recommendations on common pitfalls and highlight likely impediments to the deployment of upcoming DNS technologies.

40|$|Abstract. Publish-subscribe systems {{present the}} state of the art in {{information}} dissemination to multiple users. Such systems have evolved from simple topic-based to the current XML-enabled systems. Here, users pose complex queries (expressed in XPath) on the structure and content of the streaming documents. The parts of the documents that match the user queries are then returned to the users. This paper proposes a novel hardware architecture that would exploit the parallelism found in XPath filtering systems. Using an incoming XML stream, parsing and matching with thousands of user profiles are performed simultaneously on a single FPGA, thus yielding up to three orders of magnitude higher throughput when compared to conventional approaches bound by the sequential aspect of software computing. By converting XPath expressions into custom stacks, our architecture is the first providing full support for all structural XPath constructs, including parent-child and ancestor descendant relations, whilst allowing <b>wildcarding</b> and recursion...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Wildcards</b> extend Java {{generics}} by softening {{the mismatch}} between subtype and parametric polymorphism. Although {{they are a}} key part of the Java 5. 0 programming language, a type system including <b>wildcards</b> has never been proven type sound. <b>Wildcards</b> have previously been formalised as existential types. In this paper we extend FGJ, a featherweight formalisation of Java with generics, with existential types. We prove that this calculus, ∃J, is type sound, and illustrate how it models <b>wildcards</b> in the Java Programming Language. ∃J is not a full model for Java <b>wildcards,</b> because it does not support lower bounds for <b>wildcards.</b> We discuss why ∃J can not be easily extended with lower bounds, and how full Java <b>wildcards</b> could be modelled in a type sound way. ...|$|R

40|$|Parameter {{sweeping}} is {{a widely}} used algorithmic technique in computational science. It is specially suited for high-throughput computing since the jobs evaluating the parameter space are loosely coupled or independent. A tool that integrates the modeling of a parameter study with the control of jobs in a distributed architecture is presented. The main task is to facilitate the creation and deletion of job templates, which are the elements describing the jobs to be run. Extra functionality relies upon the GridWay Metascheduler, acting as the middleware layer for job submission and control. It supports interesting features like multi-dimensional sweeping space, <b>wildcarding</b> of parameters, functional evaluation of ranges, value-skipping and job template automatic indexation. The use of this tool increases {{the reliability of the}} parameter sweep study thanks to the systematic bookkeping of job templates and respective job statuses. Furthermore, it simplifies the porting of the target application to the grid reducing the required amount of time and effort. Comment: 26 pages, 1 figure...|$|E
