This implied accommodation {{close to the}} armed forces' Central <b>War</b> <b>Room.</b> In May 1939 {{it was decided that}} the Cabinet would be housed within the Central <b>War</b> <b>Room.</b> In August 1939, with war imminent and protected government facilities in the suburbs not yet ready, the War Rooms became operational on 27 August 1939, only days before the invasion of Poland on 1 September, and Britain's declaration of war on Germany on 3 September.|$|E

500|$|After the war, the {{historic}} {{value of the}} Cabinet <b>War</b> <b>Rooms</b> was recognised. Their preservation became {{the responsibility of the}} Ministry of Works and later the Department for the Environment, during which time very limited numbers of the public were able to visit by appointment. In the early 1980s the Imperial War Museum was asked to take over the administration of the site, and the Cabinet <b>War</b> <b>Rooms</b> were opened to the public in April 1984. [...] The museum was reopened in 2005 following a major redevelopment as the Churchill Museum and Cabinet <b>War</b> <b>Rooms,</b> but in 2010 this was shortened to the Churchill <b>War</b> <b>Rooms.</b>|$|R
50|$|The only central London citadel {{currently}} open to {{the public}} is the Cabinet <b>War</b> <b>Rooms,</b> located in Horse Guards Road in the basement of what is now HM Treasury. This was not a purpose-built citadel but was instead a reinforced adaptation of an existing basement built many years before. The <b>War</b> <b>Rooms</b> were constructed in 1938 and were heavily used by Winston Churchill during World War II. However, the Cabinet <b>War</b> <b>Rooms</b> were vulnerable to a direct hit and were abandoned not long after the war. The Cabinet <b>War</b> <b>Rooms</b> were a secret to all civilians until their opening to the public in 1984. They are now maintained by the Imperial War Museum.|$|R
5|$|The {{originally}} scheduled {{start date}} was mid-August 1995, but filming was delayed until February 26, 1996. Director Tim Burton hired Peter Suschitzky as the cinematographer, {{because he was}} a fan of his work in David Cronenberg's films. Production designer Thomas Wynn (A Beautiful Mind, Malcolm X) intended to have the <b>war</b> <b>room</b> pay tribute to Dr. Strangelove (1964). During production, Burton insisted that the art direction, cinematography and costume design of Mars Attacks! incorporate the look of the 1960s trading cards.|$|E
5|$|Bond and Leiter {{alert the}} Thunderball <b>war</b> <b>room</b> of their suspicions of Largo {{and join the}} crew of the American nuclear {{submarine}} Manta as the ransom deadline nears. The Manta chases the Disco Volante to capture it and recover the bombs en route to the first target. An undersea battle ensues between the crews, while Bond fights Largo. Bond, now very weak from his efforts to disable the bombs, tries to get away, but Largo corners him in an underwater cave and easily overpowers him. Before Largo can finish Bond off Domino shoots him with a spear gun. The bombs are recovered and Bond is sent to hospital with Domino.|$|E

The <b>war</b> <b>room</b> was located at 15, Rakabganj Road and kept track of 160 Lok Sabha constituencies where the party needed to boost its preparations. The Congress party initiated its election campaign in January 2014. It gave extra focus to the new middle class of India which was above the poverty line but not enough rich to be in middle class. This new economic class comprises 700 million people out of the country's total population of 1.2 billion. This class includes railway coolies, servants, rickshaw-pullers, labourers, fishermen, guards and other people who earn their living by doing minor chores.|$|E

25|$|Users {{were able}} to {{purchase}} and form clubs. There were four clubhouse designs available to purchase – the Basic Clubhouse, the Desert Haven, nDream's <b>War</b> <b>Room</b> Clubhouse, and the Crystal Seashores Clubhouse. Each club had a leader, who was the user that purchased the club. The leader could elect up to 4 sub-leaders and could have up to 32 members in total, including the owner. A user could only {{be a member of}} up to five clubs, including the club that the user may have been the leader of. Though the user could own multiple clubhouse designs, they could only be the leader of one club and decided which clubhouse design would be used as the meeting place for their club. In a similar way to personal spaces, the club's owner was able to set up and decorate a private clubhouse as a meeting point for club members, and the club members could enter the clubhouse at any time. The clubhouses also featured a notice board where the leader or sub-leaders could post messages and announcements to other members. Japan's Basic Clubhouse's video screen had the option to access a Home member's page after they had entered their PSN information. Users could block other users from being a member of their club. In addition to all the standard features of the clubhouses, the <b>War</b> <b>Room</b> Clubhouse helped club owners or sub-leaders get their message across during club meetings or discussions. It also included a special access point allowing users to teleport from the <b>War</b> <b>Room</b> to other set locations.|$|E

5|$|The Cabinet <b>War</b> <b>Rooms</b> is an {{underground}} complex {{that served as}} a British government command centre throughout the Second World War. Located beneath the Treasury building in the Whitehall area of Westminster, the facilities became operational in 1939 and were in constant use until their abandonment in August 1945 after the surrender of Japan. Their historical value was recognised early on, and the public were able to visit by appointment. However, the practicalities of allowing public access to a site beneath a working government office meant that only 4,500 of 30–40,000 annual applicants to visit the <b>War</b> <b>Rooms</b> could be admitted. The museum agreed to take over the administration of the site in 1982, a development keenly supported by the then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, an admirer of Britain's wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Thatcher opened the <b>War</b> <b>Rooms</b> in April 1984. In 2003 a further suite of rooms, used as accommodation by Churchill, his wife and close associates, were added to the museum. The restoration of these rooms, which since the war had been stripped out and used for storage, cost £7.5 million. In 2005 the <b>War</b> <b>Rooms</b> were rebranded as the Churchill Museum and Cabinet <b>War</b> <b>Rooms,</b> with 850m2 of the site redeveloped as a biographical museum exploring Churchill's life. The development of the Churchill Museum cost a further £6 million. The centrepiece is a 15m interactive table which enables visitors to access digitised material, particularly from the Churchill Archives Centre, via an 'electronic filing cabinet'. The museum was renamed the Churchill <b>War</b> <b>Rooms</b> in 2010.|$|R

The apartment also echoes the film The Man Who Fell to Earth, with a book prop named Masterpieces in Paint and Poetry and a tennis courtroom with similar wallpaper. Set designers selected four Kansas City sculptors' works for use on the set of Dr. Manhattan's apartment, after discovering their works on the Internet. Filming ended on February 19, 2008.|$|E
