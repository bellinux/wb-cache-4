When asked what <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> {{for him to}} support Major, Tebbit responded: [...] "Have an entirely new department, the sole job {{of which would be}} to deal with the Brussels {{machinery}} in every aspect. I agree that we don't want to leave the EU, but we've got to manipulate it and block every single advance we don't like. No, no, no must be his weapon. Veto everything he disapproves of or that we disapprove of".|$|E
2500|$|Carlton Blanchard: {{played by}} William Hickey, Carlton {{is an old}} man with a high-pitched nasal voice whose {{outwardly}} meek yet privately demanding behavior causes everyone who meets him to shudder at his coming. He is also known for asking bizarre questions such as [...] "If you were to carpet Florida, how long <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> to vacuum it?" [...] and [...] "If a monkey were to bite you, what kind of drugs do you suppose they'd give you?". He annoys Joe, Brian, Lowell and Antonio when he wins a charity contest sponsored by Sandpiper and demands to be flown to Las Cruces, New Mexico, far beyond the scope of Sandpiper's routes.|$|E
2500|$|On June 22, 2014, Savant made {{an error}} in a word problem. [...] The {{question}} was: If two people could complete a project in six hours, how long <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> each of them to do identical projects on their own, given that one took four hours longer than the other? Her answer was 10 hours and 14 hours, reasoning that if together it took them 6 hours to complete a project, then the total effort was 12 [...] "man hours". If they then each do a separate full project, the total effort needed would be 24 hours, so the answer (10+14) needed to add up to 24 with a difference of 4. However, this {{ignores the fact that}} the two people get different amounts of work done per hour: if they are working jointly on a project, they can maximize their combined productivity, but if they split the work in half, one person will finish sooner and can't fully contribute. This subtlety causes the problem to require solving a quadratic equation and thus to not have a rational solution, instead the answer is approximately 10.32 and 14.32 hours (or more precisely, [...] and [...] ). Savant later acknowledged the error.|$|E

2500|$|Brooke {{recorded}} in his war diary on 3 October 1941, that a messenger {{had arrived at}} midnight with orders to prepare a plan to attack Trondheim in one week {{and that he was}} to go to Chequers, the prime minister's country house, that evening to discuss the idea over dinner. Accordingly, Brooke together with General Sir John Dill, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Admiral Sir Dudley Pound, the First Sea Lord and Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Portal, the Chief of the Air Staff and Clement Attlee, the Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the Labour Party were also in attendance. Brooke recorded that [...] "We sat up til 2.15 pm discussing the problem and I did my best to put the PM off the plan" [...] and that they [...] "Resumed discussion at 11 am and went on till 1 pm, I think PM is beginning to weaken on the plan". Brooke was mistaken and later wrote: [...] "From then on, we would continually be in trouble riding him [...] off mad plans to go back to Norway. Why he wanted to go back and {{what he was going to}} do there, even if he did succeed in capturing Trondheim, we never found out". On 12 October, Brooke was required to present a detailed plan for the Norway invasion, now code named Operation Ajax, which he had compiled with Admiral Sir John Tovey, Air Chief Marshall Sir William Sholto Douglas and General Sir Bernard Paget (who was to command it). Churchill complained that it was not a plan but a [...] "masterly treatise" [...] on the difficulties of the venture. Churchill avoided the main reason (lack of air support) during two hours of interrogation; raising details such as why he forsaw frosts (as stated in the Climate Book) and why <b>would</b> <b>it</b> <b>take</b> 24 hours to go from A to B (because of enemy resistance and removing road blocks). According to one account (but not mentioned by Brooke) Brooke suddenly relented and agreed to mount the expedition on the condition that the navy could take the fleet into Trondheim Fjord in support, but the elderly Pound merely shook his head and ended the discussion. [...] Churchill again asked the Joint Planning Staff to reconsider Ajax without reference to Brooke or Paget, but the JPS, and the Chiefs of Staff, supported Brooke's conclusions, citing the lack of air superiority or any hope of achieving it.|$|E

5000|$|Finally, in the mid-70s, as {{the threat}} of {{terrorism}} grew, the Pentagon and Army senior leadership appointed Beckwith to form the unit. Beckwith estimated that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> 24 months to get his new unit mission-ready. Beckwith's estimate resulted from a conversation he had earlier with Brigadier John Watts while updating his SAS experience in England in 1976. Watts had made it clear to Beckwith that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> eighteen months to build a squadron, but advised him to tell the Army leadership that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> two years, and not to [...] "let anyone talk (him) out of this." [...] To justify why <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> two years to build Delta, Beckwith and his staff drafted what they dubbed the [...] "Robert Redford Paper."
