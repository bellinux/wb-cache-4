500|$|According to Vig, Not Your Kind of People evokes ambient vibes of Garbage's {{first two}} albums, Garbage and Version 2.0: [...] "There's lots of {{elements}} of things we've always loved: noisy guitars, big electronic beats, atmospheric film moments", {{adding that the}} band [...] "wanted to make a record sound like something that <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> when we're driving the car." [...] While the record was reminiscent [...] "vibe-wise" [...] of the band's early work, the production aimed for a rawer sound, instead of cleaning up the sound through computers, to [...] "capture a performance" [...] and [...] "sound kind of trashy and for the songs to blow out a little bit." [...] Vig said, [...] "we tried to leave {{a lot of the}} performance raw on this album. A lot of the songs, we sort of throw paint at the wall and some of it sticks and some of it drips off." [...] He explained that the group avoided reinventing themselves: [...] "We wanted to just embrace exactly who we are and what we like to do and just sort of update it sonically for 2012. For better or worse, when we approach a song, it's going to end up sounding like Garbage. I think we have a strong sonic identity, and I think that's an asset these days." [...] Manson similarly noted that what mattered most was the record sounding authentic to who they are as a band. Manson considered that while the record recalled the band's classic sound [...] "it fits in with radio programming right now"; She said that they are interested in also reaching a new generation and, regarding their distinct sound, [...] "We don't sound like anyone else on the radio. Much to our surprise there hasn't been another band like ours since we came off the road." ...|$|E
2500|$|The band's first {{performance}} in 2005 {{was at the}} Live 8 concert, Barrie, Ontario on July 2 where the song [...] "Where Are You" [...] was premiered in its final form. For this tour they were accompanied by guitarist Joel Shearer of the band Pedestrian. Leading up to the album's release, they toured several small clubs in the Los Angeles area [...] "to work the bugs out" [...] and help the band get a better feel for the songs. They then toured steadily across North America, opening two shows for The Rolling Stones, until October when a family member of a band member became ill and several shows had to be canceled. The band chose to play smaller venues on this tour rather than arenas because the sound quality was better. [...] "And for us, this new record {{is one of those}} things where there are a lot of little guitar parts happening all over the place and little textures -- and <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> that stuff." [...] A cross-Canadian tour continued through summer of 2006 with the final show being played at Rogers Centre in Toronto. The band entered a hiatus period after this while Maida worked on his solo album, The Hunter's Lullaby. They wouldn't play live again until mid-2008.|$|E

The interrogator later remarked that al-Sharbi <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> assert superiority and had a [...] "seeming preoccupation with death".

Because of this, and because pre-service teachers make extensive use of material found during internet searches, much of it purporting to exemplify ‘good’ practice, we were interested to know what sense they make of such material. By encouraging pre-service teachers to reflect and comment on the practices being promoted in this way, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> what they focused on, their initial views of {{the teaching and learning}} shown in the video, and how their views were formed and affected by engaging in discussion...|$|R

Not a pleasant sound but it's the noise we had. We pressed it up and stuck it out. A celebration of sorts." [...] Jimmy Cauty defended sampling as an artistic practice: [...] "It's not as if we're taking anything away, just borrowing and making things bigger. If you're creative you aren't going to stop working just because there is a law against what you are doing." ...|$|R

We showed violent news clips for 12 eleven and twelve year olds. In the meantime, we recorded the children’s reactions on film. Afterward, we interviewed them about their thoughts and feelings related to the clips. Our study is based on interviews and observations. We {{came to the conclusion}} that the children in our study think violence are very unnecessary. Most of the children did not find the clips particularly scary, but many mentioned that they think blood is disgusting to watch...|$|R

5000|$|Following {{preliminary}} recording {{sessions in}} Maui, Mike Turner left the band in December 2001 after recording rhythm guitar parts for several songs that would {{appear on the}} album. Band members in interviews {{said that he and}} the band weren't seeing eye to eye anymore but according to official press releases the split was amicable. Duncan Coutts said of the split, [...] "We weren't allowing him to do what he really <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do, and he wasn't playing what <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> ... This recording process magnified that, but {{it was a long time}} coming." [...] The remaining band members then commenced a 2-month public search during which the band received thousands of demo tapes, videos and CDs from all over the world, including Australia and Japan. They chose Detroit native, Steve Mazur, who Coutts and Taggart knew through mutual friends in Los Angeles. After his inception into the band was announced in April, Raine Maida noted: [...] "It felt like a cohesive unit...It just felt incredible. It felt like a new band, totally fresh." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} anatomical, physiological, and {{behavioral}} {{evidence suggests that}} the brain performs computations using modules that are repeated across species, brain areas, and modalities. What are these canonical modules, and how can we elucidate their underlying circuitry and mechanisms? This workshop brought together a group of experimental and theoretical neuroscientists to outline a roadmap for research leading to one or more canonical models of neural computation. We aimed to develop a broad set of themes that span different levels of analysis (cellular, networks, systems, cognition, and behavior), species (mammals and invertebrates), brain areas (cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum), and modalities (vision, audition, vestibular, etc.). The participants were primarily researchers in basic science, but some also investigate developmental disabilities and disease. Our intent was to use this meeting to catalyze new research efforts, to define a program of research that may be shared and collaborative between the various participants or subgroups of participants. To this end, we asked the speakers to give informal and discussion-oriented talks, rather than a more standard seminar. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> mostly about what they are planning t...|$|R

The next morning there came, I believe, another despatch, {{but it was not}} published; and it was not until we heard that Daun and Lacy were both within a few miles of the town that we knew that, somehow or other, there had been a mistake about the matter, a mistake that has not yet been cleared up, at Dresden." ...|$|E

It threatened rain, but did not much; and Prior and I walked an hour in the Park, which quite put me out of my measures. I dined with a friend hard by; and in the evening sat with Lord Masham till twelve.

He swears he would vote for us, but dare not, because all Scotland would detest him if he did: he should never be chosen again, nor be able to live there.|$|E
500|$|As Petrucci and Rudess {{felt that}} the album needed real string lines and choirs, {{as well as other}} organic sounds, they enlisted the help of veteran {{composer}} David Campbell to assist with aspects of the orchestration and handle the logistics of recording all of the necessary musicians. Reflecting on the process for Keyboard, Rudess explained, [...] "Our initial thought was, let’s do it all on rock instruments and let David arrange it, but that wasn’t really thinking ahead in terms of who we are. When we go into the studio, we tend to work on things until they’re pretty polished. So we got into what we called pre-orchestrating. I’d use any sound at my disposal to place strings where <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> strings, choir where <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> choir, and so forth—but without getting overly specific about a certain patch or instrument library being the one, because we knew it was all going to be replaced with real players."
