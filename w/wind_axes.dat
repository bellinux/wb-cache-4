In close formation, the wing UAV motion is affected by the vortex of the adjacent lead aircraft. The forces produced by these vortices are complex functions of relative position coordinates of the UAVs. In this paper, these forces are treated as unknown functions. For trajectory tracking, invertibility of certain input–output maps in the <b>wind</b> <b>axes</b> system are examined. Interestingly, in the <b>wind</b> <b>axes</b> system, the system is not invertible, but in a simplified co-ordinate system obtained from the <b>wind</b> <b>axes</b> system for which the velocity roll is zero, inverse control of separation co-ordinates is possible. Variable structure control laws are derived for separation trajectory control of wing aircraft in the simplified wind co-ordinate system and for the flight control of the lead aircraft. Simulation results for two UAVs are presented which show precise separation trajectory control in spite of the presence of unknown vortex forces, while the lead aircraft maneuvers. Furthermore, these results confirm that when the wing aircraft is positioned properly in the vortex of the lead aircraft, there is a reduction in the required flight power.

40|$|This paper {{treats the}} design of a {{decentralized}} nonlinear robust control system for formation flying of multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). In close formation, it is assumed that vortex of any UAV affects the motion of all the UAVs behind it. The forces produced by these vortices are complex functions of relative position co-ordinates of the UAVs. In this paper, these forces are treated as unknown functions, which cannot be parameterized. Since the system is not invertible in the <b>wind</b> <b>axes</b> system, a simplified co-ordinate system obtained from the <b>wind</b> <b>axes</b> system for which the velocity roll (bank angle) is zero, is considered for {{the design of}} the control system. A nonlinear robust control system for the separation trajectory control of the wing aircraft in the simplified wind coordinate system is derived. Uncertain functions and unmeasured variables are estimated using a high-gain observer for the synthesis of the control system. Each wing UAV synthesizes its control law using its own state variables and the relative position of the preceding UAV with respect to the wing UAV. Thus the control system is decentralized since each UAV has to communicate (depending on sensors for position measurement) with at most one (preceding) UAV, and no data transmission from the remaining vehicles is required. Simulation results for two UAVs are presented which show precise separation trajectory control of each wing UAV in spite of the presence of unknown and unstructured vortex forces, while the lead aircraft maneuvers. Furthermore, these results confirm that when the wing aircraft is positioned properly in the vortex of the lead aircraft, it experiences reduction in its required flight power.

The recent test of the Tilt Rotor Aeroacoustic Model (TRAM) with a single, 1 / 4 -scale V- 22 rotor in the German-Dutch Wind Tunnel (DNW) provides an extensive set of aeroacoustic, performance, and structural loads data. The calculations were performed using the rotorcraft comprehensive analysis CAMRAD II. The comparison of measurements and calculations includes helicopter mode operation (performance, airloads, and blade structural loads), hover performance, and airplane mode performance. The correlation establishes the level of predictive capability achievable with current technology; identifies the limitations of the current aerodynamic, wake, and structural models of tiltrotors; and leads to recommendations for research to extend tiltrotor aeromechanics analysis capability.

Our kick simulations include the effects of pulsar acceleration and spin-up and our maximum likelihood comparison with the data constrains the model parameters. The fit to the pulsar spin and velocity measurements suggests that (1) the anisotropic momentum required amounts to ∼ 10 % of the neutrino flux, (2) while a prekick spin of the star is required, the preferred magnitude is small 10 - 20 rad s - 1, so that for the best-fit models (3) the bulk of the spin is kick-induced with Ω̄ ∼ 120 rad s - 1 and (4) the models suggest that the anisotropy emerges on a timescale τ ∼ 1 - 3 s. © 2007.

40|$|Hekla is {{the most}} active silicic volcano in Iceland, with 18 subplinian–Plinian eruptions since AD 1104. In the period 1970 to 2000, the {{frequency}} of such eruptions increased to once every decade. Hekla is currently inflated to above the levels observed prior {{to the most recent}} eruptions in 1991 and 2000. The next eruption could pose a hazard to air traffic between North America and Europe because explosive eruptions of Hekla, independent of size, typically start with a subplinian or Plinian phase that produces a sustained ash plume. We present an overview of five of the largest historical Hekla eruptions (taking place in 1104, 1158, 1300, 1693, and 1766). These eruptions cover a compositional range of rhyolite to andesite, previously estimated Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) values of 4 – 5 and are characterised by contrasting <b>wind</b> dispersal (dispersal <b>axes</b> NW–NE). New isopach maps show both greater deposit thicknesses in the proximal region and wider dispersal than previously inferred, resulting in different volume estimates (minimal values ranging between 0. 18 and 0. 91 km 3).

These changes in the estimated values of volume and mass eruption rates have large implications on the forecasting and impacts of future Hekla eruptions...|$|R

The crash of the falling spars, as they came, in succession, across the decks of the vessel, appeared to produce no sensation amid that scene of complicated danger; but the seamen proceeded in silence to their hopeless duty of clearing the wrecks. Every eye followed the floating timbers, as the waves swept them away from the vessel, with a sort of feverish curiosity, to witness the effect produced by their collision with those rocks that lay so fearfully near them; but long before the spars entered the wide border of foam, they were hid from view by the furious element in which they floated. It was now felt by the whole crew of the Ariel, that their last means of safety had been adopted; and, at each desperate and headlong plunge the vessel took into the bosom of the seas that rolled upon her forecastle, the anxious seamen thought that they could perceive the yielding of the iron that yet clung to the bottom, or could hear the violent surge of the parting strands of the cable, that still held them to their anchors. While the minds of the sailors were agitated with the faint hopes that had been excited by the movements of their schooner, Dillon had been permitted to wander about the deck unnoticed: his rolling eyes, hard breathing, and clenched hands excited no observation among the men, whose thoughts were yet dwelling on the means of safety. But now, when, with a sort of frenzied desperation, he would follow the retiring waters along the decks, and venture his person nigh the group that had collected around and on the gun of the cockswain, glances of fierce or of sullen vengeance were cast at him, that conveyed threats of a nature that he was too much agitated to understand.|$|R
40|$|Small Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) {{are good}} {{candidates}} to extract energy from wind {{in urban areas}} because {{they are easy to}} install, service and do not generate much noise; however, the aerodynamic efficiency of small turbines is low. Here-in a new turbine, with high aerodynamic efficiency, is proposed. The novel design is based on the classical H-Darrieus VAWT. VAWTs produce the highest power when the blade chord is perpendicular to the incoming wind direction. The basic idea behind the proposed turbine is to extend that said region of maximum power by having the blades continue straight instead of following a circular path. This motion can be performed if the blades turn along two axes; hence it was named Dual Vertical Axis Wind Turbine (D-VAWT). The analysis of this new turbine is done through the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with 2 D and 3 D simulations. While 2 D is used to validate the methodology, 3 D is used to get an accurate estimate of the turbine performance. The analysis of a single blade is performed and the turbine shows that a power coefficient of 0. 4 can be achieved. So far, reaching performance levels high enough to compete with the most efficient VAWTs. The D-VAWT is still far from full optimization, but the analysis presented here shows the hidden potential and serves as proof of concept. The study of the D-VAWT is concluded with a preliminary parametric study of the turbine sensitivity to different incoming <b>wind</b> angles, turbine <b>axes</b> spacing, number of blades, airfoil profile and blade mounting point...|$|R
