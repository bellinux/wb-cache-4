5|$|For XIII-2, Game Informers Joe Juba <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> Lightning {{had been}} {{transferred}} to a supporting role in favor of Serah and Hope, whom he saw as weaker characters than Lightning. Simon Parkin of Eurogamer found that the story suffers without {{the driving force of}} Lightning's single-minded determination. VanOrd <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> Lightning and Caius Ballad have relatively limited screen-time, since they come off as stronger characters than the protagonists.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's primary {{interest}} lay {{in improving}} the state's mental and penal institutions. These improvements began under Governor Chandler, and while Johnson stated that the mental hospitals and prisons were in their best condition in forty years {{by the end of}} his term, he <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> he was not able to do more. In light of the financial obligations brought about by World War II, he had to curb state construction.|$|E
5|$|In Karlsruhe on 3 May 1842, Ernest married 21-year-old Princess Alexandrine of Baden. She was {{the eldest}} {{daughter}} of Leopold, Grand Duke of Baden and Princess Sophie of Sweden, {{daughter of the}} deposed King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden. Though he gave his consent, his father <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> his second son did not do more to advance the concerns of Coburg. The marriage did not produce any issue, though Ernest apparently fathered at least three illegitimate children in later years.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the trek}} found archaeological {{artifacts}} related to 19th-century Europeans and undisturbed disarticulated human remains, Beattie <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> more remains were not found. Examining {{the bones of}} Franklin crewmen, he noted areas of pitting and scaling often found in cases of Vitamin C deficiency, the cause of scurvy. After returning to Edmonton, he compared notes from the survey with James Savelle, an Arctic archaeologist, and noticed skeletal patterns suggesting cannibalism. Seeking information about the Franklin crew's health and diet, he sent bone samples to the Alberta Soil and Feed Testing Laboratory for trace element analysis and assembled another team to visit King William Island. The analysis would find an unexpected level of 226parts per million (ppm) of lead in the crewman's bones, which was 10times higher than the control samples, taken from Inuit skeletons from the same geographic area, of 26–36ppm.|$|E
5|$|Happy Brothers, Their Poor Mother! (often {{referred}} to simply as Happy Brothers) is an 1887 oil painting by the Serbian artist Uroš Predić. It shows four intoxicated youths walking through their village whilst {{the mother of}} one shouts her disapproval from the distance. The painting {{is said to have been}} inspired by a frequent sight in Predić's home village of Orlovat—that of drunken youths returning from the pub at dawn. Predić painted the composition hoping it would persuade the villagers to change their ways. He <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> it not only failed to decrease the incidence of drunkenness in Orlovat, but was well received by the villagers themselves, who were happy merely to have been depicted.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} session of the 33rd Congress, Breckinridge acted as {{spokesman}} for Ways and Means Committee bills, including a bill to assume and pay the debts Texas incurred prior to its annexation. Breckinridge's friends, W. W. Corcoran and Jesse D. Bright, were two of Texas's major creditors. The bill, which was approved, paid only those debts related to powers Texas surrendered to Congress upon annexation. Breckinridge <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> the House defeated a measure to pay the Sioux $12,000 owed them for the 1839 purchase of {{an island in the}} Mississippi River; the debt was never paid. Another increase in the subsidy to the Collins Line passed over his opposition, but Pierce vetoed it.|$|E

5|$|Jim Henson {{originally}} {{conceived of}} his Muppets as characters aimed at an adult audience. He <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> {{the popularity of}} the characters that appeared in Sesame Street, including Big Bird and Bert and Ernie, had solidified a public perception his Muppets were solely intended for educating children. Henson worried he would be stuck forever working on children's television series. He felt his Muppet characters should be able to be appreciated by individuals of any maturity level. Henson told The Saturday Evening Post he had constantly dealt with others looking down upon the idea of puppet performers. He envied ventriloquist Edgar Bergen for his ability to appeal to a mature audience. Henson said he wanted to work on a program that was broadcast during the peak adult-viewing time and said he had prior difficulty persuading the major television networks to create a puppet program for mature audiences.|$|E
5|$|Wigner <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> DuPont {{was given}} {{responsibility}} for the detailed design of the reactors, not just their construction. He threatened to resign in February 1943, but was talked out of it {{by the head of}} the Metallurgical Laboratory, Arthur Compton, who sent him on vacation instead. As it turned out, a design decision by DuPont to give the reactor additional load tubes for more uranium saved the project when neutron poisoning became a problem. Without the additional tubes, the reactor could have been run at 35% power until the boron impurities in the graphite were burned up and enough plutonium produced to run the reactor at full power; but this would have set the project back a year. During the 1950s, he would even work for DuPont on the Savannah River Site. Wigner did not regret working on the Manhattan Project, and sometimes wished the atomic bomb had been ready a year earlier.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of the Prince Imperial, Beatrice's brother, Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales, {{suggested}} that she marry their sister Alice's widower, Louis IV, the Grand Duke of Hesse, who had lost his wife to diphtheria in 1878. Albert Edward argued that Beatrice could act as replacement mother for Louis's young children and spend most of her time in England looking after her mother. He further suggested the Queen could oversee the upbringing of her Hessian grandchildren with greater ease. However, at the time, it was forbidden by law for Beatrice to marry her sister's widower. This was countered by the Prince of Wales, who vehemently supported passage by the Houses of Parliament of the Deceased Wife's Sister Bill, which would have removed the obstacle. Despite popular support for this measure and although it passed in the House of Commons, it was rejected by the House of Lords because of opposition from the Lords Spiritual. Although the Queen <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> the bill had failed, she was happy to keep her daughter at her side.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} {{soundtrack of}} Ocarina of Time {{was published by}} Pony Canyon and released in Japan on December 18, 1998. It comprises one compact disc with 82 tracks. A US version was also released, although with fewer tracks and different packaging artwork. Many critics praised the music in Ocarina of Time, although IGN <b>was</b> <b>disappointed</b> <b>that</b> the traditional Zelda overworld theme was not included. In 2001, {{three years after the}} initial release of Ocarina of Time, GameSpot labeled it {{as one of the top}} ten video game soundtracks. The soundtrack, at the time, was not released in Europe or Australia. In 2011, however, a 51-track limited edition soundtrack for the 3DS version was available in a free mail out through a Club Nintendo offer to owners of the 3DS edition, as an incentive to register the product. The original musical theme for the Fire Temple area was altered before release of the game, due to Nintendo's policy of not including real religious references in their products, with the altered theme simply removing the chanting samples.|$|E
