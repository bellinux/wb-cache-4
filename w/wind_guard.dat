50|$|The unique {{microclimate}} of {{the area}} provides shelter from harsher <b>winds,</b> <b>guarded</b> by the surrounding groups of cliff and rock formation enveloping the area. Snowmobiling and skiing are very popular in the area with residents as well as tourists. In past decades, and due to climate shift, the bay had previously been noted for freezing nearly every winter, however {{that is no longer}} commonplace, although icebergs are not an unusual sight.|$|R

40|$|Mars Science Laboratory's (MSL) Sample Acquisition Sample Processing and Handling (SA-SPaH) {{system is}} one of the most ambitious terrain {{interaction}} and manipulation systems ever built and successfully used outside of planet earth. Mars has a ruthless environment that has surprised many who have tried to explore there. The robustness widget program was implemented by the MSL project to help ensure the SA-SPaH system would be robust enough to the surprises of this ruthless Martian environment. The robustness widget program was an effort of extreme schedule pressure and responsibility, but was accomplished with resounding success. This paper will focus on a behind the scenes look at MSL's robustness widgets: the particle fun zone, the <b>wind</b> <b>guards,</b> and the portioner pokers...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to the instrumentation on the field, the band has keyboards, marimba, electric guitar and bass as well as various singers. The <b>wind</b> and <b>guard</b> sections of the band do not require auditions for their members, however some instruments like the piccolo, guitar, bass, and vocals require an audition which is open to any band member. The drumline and front ensemble are auditioned.|$|R
40|$|CFD {{investigation}} of the radiation and convection losses for a cavity solar receiver at the CSIRO National Solar Energy Centre was carried out using Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS). In general, {{if there is no}} wind effect, the convective heat losses through the aperture are between 5 % to 15 % of the radiative losses with this ratio increasing for larger apertures. Modelling results suggest that with no wind effect, thermal efficiency is in the range of around 71 - 85 % for a receiver with 0. 4 m × 0. 4 m absorber and 0. 4 m × 0. 4 m aperture operated between 700 and 900 °C with a total absorbed energy of 25 kW. Preliminary analysis indicated that for a small cavity receiver, ambient wind may have a substantial impact on the overall heat loss from the receiver. In order to achieve high thermal efficiency, it is suggested that a small receiver should have <b>wind</b> <b>guards</b> installed to reduce the wind effect.

FOTC members are from almost every area of study on campus, with over 30 different majors represented each year.|$|R
50|$|Sabino has {{garnered}} {{a reputation}} in the local marching band community for fielding highly entertaining productions which showcase intriguing musical repertoire and {{a high level of}} energetic musicality in the areas of percussion, <b>winds,</b> and color <b>guard</b> (flag spinning). Through the years, the band has consistently been considered by fans, teachers, and instructors, as one of the premiere bands in Tucson and in Arizona. The band has regularly won state titles and often travels out of Arizona to compete with the top bands from around the country.|$|R
50|$|A {{marching band}} or drum corps drum major (field conductor) {{is in charge}} of holding the band or corps together, and {{directing}} the entire band or corps during shows and competitions. This drum major can come from any section of the performing unit: percussion, <b>winds,</b> or color <b>guard.</b> They are chosen on their musical abilities, leadership qualities, attitude, and passion for the sport. The Drum Major is the highest-ranked band participant, usually followed by the captain(s) of the drumline, then by guard captain(s), pit captain(s) horn sergeant(s), section leaders and band officers.|$|R
5000|$|Drivers {{can also}} {{increase}} fuel efficiency by minimizing transported mass, i.e. {{the number of}} people or the amount of cargo, tools, and equipment carried in the vehicle. Removing common unnecessary accessories such as roof racks, brush <b>guards,</b> <b>wind</b> deflectors (or [...] "spoilers", when designed for downforce and not enhanced flow separation), running boards, push bars, and narrow and lower profile tires will improve fuel efficiency by reducing both weight and aerodynamic drag. Some cars also use a half size spare tire, for weight/cost/space saving purposes. On a typical vehicle, every extra 100 pounds increases fuel consumption by 2%. [...] Removing roof racks (and accessories) can decrease fuel consumption by 20%.|$|R

40|$|The containership design problem {{involves}} optimizing a nonconvex {{objective function}} over a design space that is restricted {{by a set}} of constraints defined in terms of nonconvex functions. An application of standard nonlinear optimization methods to such a problem can at best attain a local optimum that need not be a global optimum. This thesis investigates the application of alternative modeling, approximation, and global optimization techniques for developing a multidisciplinary approach to the containership design problem. The problem involves five design variables, which prioritized according to their relative importance in the model are: design draft, depth at side, speed, overall length, and maximum beam. Five constraints are imposed on the design, viz., an equality constraint to enforce the balance between the weight and the displacement, a linear inequality constraint on the length to depth ratio that is implied by the lightship weight formulation for the design to be acceptable, an inequality constraint on the metacentric height to ensure that the design satisfies the Coast <b>Guard</b> <b>wind</b> heel criterion, an inequality on the freeboard to ensure the minimum required freeboard governed by the code of federa...|$|R
25|$|When a {{war between}} Hyland and the {{neighboring}} Rolance Empire breaks out, Alisha is used by Hyland's military as a leverage to force Sorey and his friends {{to take part in}} a battle. During the skirmish, Heldalf, the Lord of Calamity himself, appears before Sorey and he is almost killed, being rescued in the nick of time by an assassin called Rose. After recovering, Sorey learns that there are four shrines with trials that a Shepherd must accomplish in order to become stronger and decides that he must clear them first before challenging Heldalf again. During his journeys, it is discovered that Rose has a high level of resonance and she becomes Sorey's Squire, joining the party along Dezel, a Seraph of <b>wind</b> who was <b>guarding</b> Rose as part of a secret agenda. After the party completes the four trials, they fall into a trap by Symonne, a fallen Seraph who works under Heldalf. It is then revealed that Dezel's true objective was to enact revenge on Symonne for causing the death of his friend and disgracing Rose's guild. Rose is severely wounded during the battle, forcing Dezel to sacrifice himself in order to protect her, and Zaveid joins the party afterwards.|$|R
5000|$|On September 28, 2003, the {{schooner}} was at Halifax Harbour at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic {{preparing to}} sail to Lunenburg, Nova Scotia and then home to Cape Cod. when Hurricane Juan struck. Larinda was moored {{north of the}} corvette HMCS Sackville when the corvette broke loose and rammed the schooner. According to the Canadian Coast <b>Guard,</b> <b>winds</b> reached up to 140 km/h. The schooner took on large amounts of water and sank just after the hurricane ended early on September 29. The sinking took place so quickly {{that only a few}} documents were saved, although all of the crew escaped unharmed. The schooner was raised by a crane and barge on October 17, 2003. [...] However the schooner was badly contaminated by harbour sewage. Mahan was unable to afford repairs and decontamination and was forced to sell Larinda. Larinda was purchased by Arthur Scott and Charlene Corkum of St. Margaret's Bay, Nova Scotia who completed repairs and now use the schooner to promote a cottage and restaurant complex. The Mahan family sued Sackville's owners, the Naval Memorial Trust in 2009 for $815,000 [...] but the Nova Scotia Supreme Court dismissed the case on August 4, 2011, concluding that the Trust had taken all necessary and appropriate precautions to secure Sackville.|$|R
50|$|The journey {{starts at}} the gateway from oblivion, through which the pilgrim soul enters among the trees and passes into the open where is a small cavern, the cave of birth, crowned by a cherry tree. Here a short winding sunken path symbolises the years of Childhood, unseeing and unknowing, whence {{we come to a}} mound of rock.Through this the {{tunnelled}} pathway leads from the darkness into the light from ignorance to the unfolding knowledge. Half way through the winding is an opening leading to steps to the hill of learning crowded by an ancient fir tree. Often this fir crowned height tempts the student to look too high but there is an unguarded hole to teach him vigilance before he comes down the hill to the level of his fellows.Following the <b>winding</b> course still <b>guarded</b> by rocks he reaches the parting of the ways. On the right ambition on the left is the straight path of austere living in the centre is the path to wedded life by which the pilgrim reaches the tiny island of joy and wonder, across the stepping stones of exploration. But he cannot stay there.All paths lead to further temptation across a stone bridge to the bamboo bridge and the geisha house but beyond them is the hill of ambition and the well of wisdom is in sight across the beautiful water.Very steep is the hill and those who climb may be separated but as they climb they reach out a helping hands and are united at the top. Descending the pilgrim finds an easy bridge across the roaring falls and treads the stepping stones through the level garden of lease and contentment to the hill of mourning where his soul goes forth though the gate of eternity.|$|R
