Asked in 2007 how she feels when criticized from within the movement, she said: [...] "Somebody has to push the envelope. If you say something that someone already agrees with, then what's the point, and so we make some more conservative animal protection organizations uncomfortable; they don't want to be associated with us because it will be embarrassing for them, and I understand that. Our own members <b>write</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> sometimes and say, 'Oh why did you do this? I don't want anyone to know I'm a PETA member.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2004, the BBC apologised unreservedly {{and paid}} £250 in {{compensation}} to a Somerset parish council, after Clarkson damaged a 30-year-old horse-chestnut tree by driving into it {{to test the}} strength of a Toyota Hilux. In December 2006, the BBC complaints department upheld the complaint of four Top Gear viewers that Clarkson had used the phrase [...] "ginger beer" [...] (rhyming slang for [...] "queer") in a derogatory manner, when Clarkson picked up on and agreed with an audience member's description of the Daihatsu Copen as being a bit [...] "gay". The [...] was criticised by the BBC Trust for glamorising drink driving in a scene showing Clarkson and James May in a vehicle, despite Clarkson saying to the camera [...] "And please do not <b>write</b> <b>to</b> <b>us</b> about drinking and driving, because I am not driving I am sailing" [...] (as they were on top of international, frozen waters). They stated the scene [...] "was not editorially justified" [...] despite occurring outside the jurisdiction of any drink-driving laws.|$|E
