60|$|It is in {{the spirit}} of these sciences, {{themselves}} parts of a general historical inquiry into the past and present of our race, that we would glance at the anecdotes, legends, and superstitions which are here collected. The writer has been chiefly interested in the question of the Evidence, its nature and motives, rather than in the question of Fact. It is desirable to know why independent witnesses, practically everywhere and always, tell the same tales. To examine the origin of these tales is not more 'superstitious' than to examine the origin of the religious and heroic mythologies of the world. It is, of course, easy to give both mythology, and 'the science of spectres,' the go by. But antiquaries will be inquiring, and these pursuits are more than mere 'antiquarian old womanries'. We follow the stream of fable, as <b>we</b> <b>track</b> a burn to its head, and it leads us into shy, and strange scenes of human life, haunted by very fearful wild-fowl, and rarely visited save by the credulous. There may be entertainment here, and, to the student of his species, there may be instruction.|$|E
60|$|When we have {{paced the}} length of the beach, it is {{pleasant}} and not unprofitable to retrace our steps and recall the whole mood and occupation of the mind during the former passage. Our tracks, being all discernible, will guide us with an observing consciousness through every unconscious wandering of thought and fancy. Here we followed the surf in its reflux to pick up a shell which the sea seemed loth to relinquish. Here we found a seaweed with an immense brown leaf, and trailed it behind us by its long snake-like stalk. Here we seized a live horseshoe by the tail, and counted the many claws of that queer monster. Here we dug into the sand for pebbles, and skipped them upon the surface of the water. Here we wet our feet while examining a jelly-fish which the waves, having just tossed it up, now sought to snatch away again. Here we trod along the brink of a fresh-water brooklet which flows across the beach, becoming shallower and more shallow, till at last it sinks into the sand and perishes in the effort to bear its little tribute to the main. Here some vagary appears to have bewildered us, for our tracks go round and round and are confusedly intermingled, as if we had found a labyrinth upon the level beach. And here amid our idle pastime we sat down upon almost the only stone that breaks the surface of the sand, and were lost in an unlooked-for and overpowering conception of the majesty and awfulness of the great deep. Thus by tracking our footprints in the sand <b>we</b> <b>track</b> our own nature in its wayward course, and steal a glance upon it when it never dreams of being so observed. Such glances always make us wiser.|$|E

40|$|A careful {{investigation}} of synchronic patterns of linguistic variation with underlying linguistic features {{can lead to}} important insights into the comprehension of diachronic phonetic processes. In this article, we showed that the method of spectral partitioning of bipartite graphs applied to synchronic dialectal data can effectively and reliably be used to investigate diachronic processes, thus contributing to {{a deeper understanding of}} the relationship between synchronic variation and diachronic change. This was illustrated through a case study carried out on Tuscan dialects, focusing on so-called Tuscan 'gorgia', a lenition process consisting of the spirantization of stop consonants. In particular, from a quantitative analysis of the sound correspondences involving voiceless and voiced stops, <b>we</b> <b>tracked</b> the evolution of the spirantization phenomenon in several respects. First, <b>we</b> <b>tracked</b> spirantization geographically, across Tuscany from the influential center of Florence to the peripheral areas. Second, <b>we</b> <b>tracked</b> it phonologically, from voiceless to voiced stops, and within each voicing class from velars to dentals and then to bilabials. Finally, <b>we</b> <b>tracked</b> it demographically, with young speakers using the most innovative sound correspondences more than old speakers. The fact that these results are in line with the literature on the topic of Tuscan 'gorgia' demonstrates the potential of the method of spectral partitioning of bipartite graphs with respect to the reconstruction of diachronic processes starting from diatopically distributed synchronic dialectal data. ...|$|R

The probes should be made with small antibodies and high brightness. We conjugated GFP binding protein (GBP) nanobodies, small single-chain antibodies from llamas, with new ∼ 7 nm quantum dots.

The Outcome Mapping begins with an analysis of stakeholders — individuals, organisations, government bodies, etc. — who influence {{the ability of a}} project to reach an objective. In doing so, REEEP tests entrepreneurs’ understanding of the stakeholder landscape: Are they aware of existing and potential competitors? Do they understand customer needs and unique characteristics? Are they relying upon a policy change in the future for their business model to be viable, and if so what are they doing to bring the change about? <b>We</b> <b>track</b> identified behavioural changes (or non-changes) that occur throughout the project.

50|$|Simple {{algorithms}} examine {{each pair}} of segments. However, if {{a large number of}} possibly intersecting segments are to be checked, this becomes increasingly inefficient since most pairs of segments are not close to one another in a typical input sequence. The most common, more efficient way to solve this problem for a high number of segments is to use a sweep line algorithm, where we imagine a line sliding across the line segments and <b>we</b> <b>track</b> which line segments it intersects at each point in time using a dynamic data structure based on binary search trees. The Shamos-Hoey algorithm applies this principle to solve the line segment intersection detection problem, as stated above, of determining whether or not a set of line segments has an intersection; the Bentley-Ottmann algorithm works by the same principle to list all intersections in logarithmic time per intersection.|$|E

The motivation for the creation of Media Cloud did not come from one particular question, but from a myriad of them. In the about section of their webpage, the developers of Media Cloud cite some of the early driving questions the system was intended to solve:*Do bloggers introduce storylines into mainstream media or the other way around?*Is online media or print news more powerful in setting news agendas?*What parts of the world are being covered or ignored by different media sources?*Where and how do important news stories begin?*How are competing terms for the same event used in different publications?*Can we characterize the overall mix of coverage for a given source?*How do patterns differ between local and national news coverage?*Can <b>we</b> <b>track</b> news cycles for specific issues?*Do online comments shape the news?The data analysis would then be able to analyze different aspects of the news coverage, such as the media sources and the languages that would cover these stories.|$|E
5000|$|Johnson {{admits that}} {{television}} and film demand less decision-making skills than video games, but {{also says that}} the benefits from reading (attention, patience, retention, the parsing of narrative threads, etc) are making a rise in television and film as well, despite its lack of translating letters to meaning or activating the imagination in quite {{the same way that}} books do. He discusses three principles of television and film: [...] "multiple threading," [...] "flashing arrow," [...] and [...] "social networks." [...] "Multiple threading", according to Johnson, is marrying complex narrative structure to complex subject matter with multiple plots and subplots (for example, he states that shows like ER & 24 have up to 10 threads per episode). He states that a [...] "Flashing Arrow" [...] is a kind of narrative signpost purposely planted to help the audience keep track of what’s going on, but there has been an increasing lack of arrows over the years both, and this lack of arrows is used to draw on intricate plotlines and obscure references. Finally, he states that [...] "reality shows demand that <b>we</b> <b>track</b> multiple relationships, since the action of these shows revolves around the shifting feuds and alliances between more than a dozen individuals” Johnson says this activates social intelligence, defining it as “our ability to monitor and recall many distinct vectors of interaction in the population around us” and, thus, watchers shall be able to better understand social networks. He asserts that television is a [...] "brilliant medium" [...] for determining how skilled people are at understanding interpersonal connections, or their Autism Quotient (the higher a person's emotional intelligence, the lower their [...] "AQ"), and that reality shows in particular realistically display the complexity of [...] "social network maps" [...] in human relations, where a group of people have complex and intertwined engagement.|$|E
