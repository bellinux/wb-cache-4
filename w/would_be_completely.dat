5|$|An {{extraterrestrial}} civilization {{may choose}} to communicate with humanity by means of artifacts or probes rather than by radio, for various reasons. While probes may {{take a long time}} to reach the Solar System, once there they would be able to hold a sustained dialogue that would be impossible using radio from hundreds or thousands of light-years away. Radio <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> unsuitable for surveillance and continued monitoring of a civilization, and should an extraterrestrial civilization wish to perform these activities on humanity, artifacts may be the only option other than to send large, crewed spacecraft to the Solar System.|$|E

5|$|In response, {{the study}} {{suggested}} that a third lane be constructed along the Sagtikos from the Southern State Parkway to the Long Island Expressway. The bridges over the Sagtikos at Campus Road and Crooked Hill Road (CR13) {{would have to be}} reconstructed {{to make room for the}} added lane, and the interchange with Pine Aire Drive (exitS3) <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> rebuilt. A new interchange would also be constructed on the parkway between Pine Aire Drive and Campus Road, creating a junction with CR100. The project would cost $4billion (2011USD) and be built in phases for 15–20 years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of {{philosophy}} of mind, the problem of free will takes on renewed intensity. This is certainly the case, at least, for materialistic determinists. According to this position, natural laws completely determine {{the course of the}} material world. Mental states, and therefore the will as well, would be material states, which means human behavior and decisions <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> determined by natural laws. Some take this reasoning a step further: people cannot determine by themselves what they want and what they do. Consequently, they are not free.|$|E

Indre Wijdefjorden has the most strict regulations, with a total ban on construction of buildings and facilities, laying of cables and roads, earthwork, drainage, drilling, blasting, and excavation of petroleum, gas and minerals. It is the authorities' goal that Svalbard is {{to be one of}} the best-managed wilderness areas in the world. Svalbard, and thus the national park, is on Norway's tentative list for nomination as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|E

5|$|A {{soldier who}} participated in the battle {{reported}} that only 20 uninjured troops were left to defend the police station as the second Syrian column reached Samakh (Tzemah). The only heavy weapon the defenders possessed was ineffective against Syrian armor. Fearing their forces <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> cut off, an order was given by the Haganah to retreat and leave the wounded, Tzvika Levkov among them. The retreat was disorganized and heavy Israeli casualties were recorded as Samakh's police station fell. Reinforcements from the Deganias, commanded by Moshe Cohen, arrived but were immediately hit by the Syrians and did not significantly affect the battle. Aharon Israeli, a platoon commander in these reinforcements, wrote that it was clear as soon as they arrived that the battle was over. Cohen would not hear of a retreat initially, but when the force saw Levkov fall into a trench, they hastily withdrew.|$|E
5|$|The Down Relief {{line between}} Bristol Temple Meads and Parson Street {{is to be}} {{partially}} reinstated {{as part of the}} MetroWest scheme in order to ease congestion. According to the Great Western Route Utilisation Strategy, in the December 2007 timetable period, the line through Parson Street was running at over 75% capacity in the morning peak between 8 and 9am. It was predicted that by 2019, trains working the line <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> full during peak hours. While the three tracks could cope with traffic generated by the reopening of the Portishead Line, campaigners note it would leave little room for growth. Parson Street Junction will also be upgraded during the works.|$|E
5|$|The {{difficulty}} {{of handling the}} divergent requirements was compounded when, in May 1963, shortly following on from the official issuing of Specification OR356/AW406, the option of having two distinct aircraft was rejected; the Secretary of State for Defence, Peter Thorneycroft, had insisted upon {{the development of a}} single common aircraft to meet the requirements of both services. According to Woods, Thorneycroft's decision had been influenced by the American General Dynamics F-111 multirole program, and had sought to duplicate this development concept for the P.1154. Despite a stated Navy preference for a swing-wing fighter, the services agreed that the aircraft <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> common, with the exception of different radar systems. However, upon requests by various electronics manufacturers to the Ministry of Aviation to be issued with the requirements for the electronics fit, no response was ever issued; this lack of leadership proved disruptive to the overall programme.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the eighth}} season of The X-Files, David Duchovny {{announced}} that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> leaving the show. As such, {{the future of the}} show was up in the air. Before greenlighting a ninth season, neither the Fox Network nor any of the Ten Thirteen Productions members knew if creator Chris Carter would return for another season. With this being said, he encouraged {{the other members of the}} crew to continue the series without him. Eventually, however, several crew members began to develop new scripts ideas for the ninth season, many of which excited Carter. This new-found enthusiasm eventually caused Carter to sign a contract with Fox for another year. Likewise, Anderson signed on at the last minute, with her contract extension only lasting until the end of 2002; she specifically stated that she would leave the show following the conclusion of the season. Due to the changes in the cast, during the ninth season Doggett and Reyes became the series' new leads. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz speculated that the show could extend into a tenth and possibly eleventh season, if the show was able to attract an audience. However, the show lost viewers and was eventually cancelled by Fox.|$|E
5|$|In 1848–49, Hippolyte Fizeau {{determined}} {{the speed of}} light between an intense light source and a mirror about 8km distant. The light source was interrupted by a rotating cogwheel with 720 notches that could be rotated at a variable speed of up to hundreds of times a second. (Figure1) Fizeau adjusted the rotation speed of the cogwheel until light passing through one notch of the cogwheel <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> eclipsed by the adjacent tooth. Spinning the cogwheel at 3, 5 and 7 times this basic rotation rate also resulted in eclipsing of the reflected light by the cogwheel teeth next in line. Given the rotational speed of the wheel and the distance between the wheel and the mirror, Fizeau was able to calculate a value of 315000km/s for {{the speed of light}}. It was difficult for Fizeau to visually estimate the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, and his value for light's speed was about 5% too high. Fizeau's paper appeared in Comptes Rendus: Hebdomadaires de scéances de l’Academie de Sciences (Paris, Vol. 29 , pp.90–92).|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Transport for London {{suggested}} that pedestrianisation {{may not be}} a suitable long-term measure due to Crossrail reducing the demand for bus services along Oxford Street, and proposed to ban all traffic except buses and cycles during peak shopping times. Optimisation of existing traffic signals along the street, including Pedestrian Countdown signals, have also been proposed. Transport for London is concerned that in the long term traffic problems may affect trade on Oxford Street, which is now competing with shopping centres such as Westfield London, Westfield Stratford City and the Brent Cross shopping centre. In 2015, while campaigning for election as London Mayor, Labour's Sadiq Khan favoured the full pedestrianisation of Oxford Street, which was supported by other parties. After winning the election, he pledged the street <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> pedestrianised by 2020, including a ban on buses and taxis. By 2017, this had been revised forward {{to the end of the}} following year.|$|E

5|$|Paul Reubens (born Paul Rubenfeld; August 27, 1952) is an American actor, writer, film producer, {{game show}} host, and comedian, {{best known for}} his {{character}} Pee-wee Herman. Reubens joined the Los Angeles troupe The Groundlings in the 1970s and started his career as an improvisational comedian and stage actor. In 1982, Reubens put up a show about a character he had been developing for years. The show was called The Pee-wee Herman Show and it ran for five sold-out months with HBO producing a successful special about it. Pee-wee became an instant cult figure and for the next decade, Reubens <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> committed to his character, doing all of his public appearances and interviews as Pee-wee. In 1985 Pee-wee's Big Adventure, directed by the then-unknown Tim Burton, was a financial and critical success, and soon developed into a cult film. Big Top Pee-wee, 1988's sequel, was less successful than its predecessor. Between 1986 and 1990, Reubens starred as Pee-wee in the CBS Saturday-morning children's program Pee-wee's Playhouse.|$|E
5|$|The French {{started their}} {{evacuation}} with their pre-conceived notion that few {{would want to}} head south. As knowledge of the migration program spread through the communist-controlled north, thousands of predominantly northern Catholic asylum-seekers descended on the capital Hanoi and the port of Haiphong, {{both of which were}} still in French control. This led to anarchy and confusion as the emigrants fought over limited shelter, food, medicine and places on the ships and planes that were bound for the south. By early August, there were over 200,000evacuees waiting in Hanoi and Haiphong. Initially the ad hoc camps had insufficient sanitation and water quality control, leading to the possibility of outbreaks of disease. Some American representatives said that they were the worst conditions they had seen. The conditions continued to be poor and chaotic after the evacuation got into full swing, and did not improve significantly for a month. There was no organization infrastructure as far as registration or medical records and immunisation of the waiting evacuees. The communists thus sent their propaganda activists through the camps and said that the lack of organisation proved that life for prospective refugees would be even worse in the south, where they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> under the control of South Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|During World War II in Yugoslavia, the United States {{initially}} {{supported the}} royal government of Yugoslavia. When the Nazis invaded Yugoslavia {{in the spring}} of 1941, the United States decisively supported the Chetniks {{in the first years of}} the war. This support took place in the form of extensive clandestine relations between the Office of Strategic Services and Chetniks with William Donovan's administration. Such cooperation was highlighted by complex operations such as Operation Halyard, in which several hundred American pilots were rescued by Chetniks. However, OSS support for the Chetniks was compromised by the United Kingdom's MI6 policy of favoring the Yugoslav Partisans over the Chetniks. In 1943, the US government's support for the Chetniks over the Yugoslav Partisans was such that president Franklin D. Roosevelt discussed with Winston Churchill in a private conversation that he imagined that Yugoslavia's boundaries <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>completely</b> redrawn into three separate states, with Peter Karađorđević Jr. being the monarch of an independent Serbian kingdom at the end of the war. The USAF and the British RAF began bombing Belgrade indiscriminately in April 1944 when they thought that Nazi occupation could not be removed by home-grown resistance alone. The United States intelligence circles gradually conceded its influence on Yugoslav guerrilla operations to the British. At the end of the war, President Harry S. Truman dedicated a Legion of Merit to Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović, but the award wasn't revealed publicly until 2005.|$|E
