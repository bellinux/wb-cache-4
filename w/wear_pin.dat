50|$|Traditionally, {{the wear}} of {{materials}} {{has been characterized}} by weight loss and wear rate. However, {{studies have found that}} wear coefficient is more suitable. The reason being that it takes the wear rate, the applied load, and the hardness of the <b>wear</b> <b>pin</b> into account. Although, measurement variations by an order of 10-1 have been observed, the variations can be minimized if suitable precautions are taken.|$|E
40|$|Modem {{aircraft}} use Carbon-Carbon Composite (CCC) {{materials for}} the heat-pack elements of the brake (Tarter, 1991). The elevated wear-rate mechanism of CCC brakes at low operating temperatures (< 100 °C) is well understood (Abbott, 1995). Oxidation of these friction materials increases between temperatures of 400 °C - 600 °C (Cullinan et al, 1989), which also increases the level of heat-pack wear. The current method for monitoring the life of CCC brakes is by visual inspection of the <b>wear</b> <b>pin</b> indicator. The limitation of this method {{is that there is}} no means of determining the causes of elevated heat-pack wear. This executive summary presents two innovative solutions to this wear-rate problem. The first solution monitors and records the amount of low-energy braking applications that occur on a conventional hydraulic braking system by processing the representative temperature and pressure information of the hydraulic brake fluid.

40|$|Dry sliding {{wear test}} was {{conducted}} on Al-fly ash composites employing pin-on-disc wear testing rig. The influence of parameters such as weight percentage of fly ash, load, and sliding speed on the wear rate of specimens was investigated.

The Taguchi and analysis of variance (ANOVA) techniques were employed to investigate the influence of parameters on the wear rate of composite. Multiple linear regression models were developed to predict the wear rate of the composites. It {{was found that the}} weight percentage of fly ash was the most dominant factor influencing the wear rate followed by the applied load and sliding speed. The morphology of worn surfaces of the <b>wear</b> <b>pins</b> was analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) to analyze the wear behaviour.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} work, hybrid {{composites}} are fabricated with self-lubricating characteristics {{to make them}} as resource-efficient materials. AA 6061 - 10 wt. % B 4 C–MoS 2 hybrid composites reinforced with 2. 5, 5 and 7. 5 [*]wt. % concentration of MoS 2 particles are produced using stir casting technique, and mechanical and tribological properties are evaluated. Microstructural characterization of the hybrid composites revealed the uniform distribution of reinforcement (B 4 C and MoS 2) particles in the matrix material. Hardness and fracture toughness of the hybrid composites are decreased monotonously {{with an increase in}} the addition of MoS 2 particles. Dry sliding tribological studies conducted using a pin-on-disk tribotester under atmospheric conditions revealed the formation of MoS 2 -lubricated tribolayer on the <b>worn</b> <b>pin</b> surface which significantly influenced the tribological properties. The addition of MoS 2 particles decreased the friction coefficient and wear rate of the hybrid composites. Delamination and abrasion are observed to be the controlling wear mechanisms and material in the form of platelet-shaped debris, and flow-type chip debris is formed, and a long and shallow crater on the <b>worn</b> <b>pin</b> surface of the hybrid composite is also observed...|$|R
