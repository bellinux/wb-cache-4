40|$|In {{contrast}} to other studies {{of students in}} online environments, which examine the skills and attitudes that students bring to an online university learning environment, {{we are interested in}} the expectations with which students come to online university study. Four expectational barriers, which arise from students’ background and cultural history, are identified as being: <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>responsible</b> for learning, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>responsible</b> for student interaction with content, <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>responsible</b> for the use of appropriate learning strategies and <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>responsible</b> for required ancillary skills.

5|$|It {{is unclear}} exactly <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>responsible</b> {{for the damage}} on the German ships. It is {{possible}} that the mines were air-dropped by RAF Handley Page Hampden bombers.

5|$|The San Joaquin County Jail in French Camp, California. Shortly {{after the}} prison opened, six prisoners escaped after cutting through a one-inch {{bar in the}} dayroom with a hacksaw.

Severely bruised, Michelle Charters (Teryl Rothery) claims that she knows <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>responsible</b> and names the attacker as Hal Arden, an elderly resident of Excelsis Dei. When questioned, Arden admits that he made sexual overtures to her, but claims that it was harmless {{and that he is}} too elderly to have done anything.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the exact}} {{details of the}} {{assassination}} remain disputed, {{the involvement of the}} Portuguese government, particularly Aginter Press or PIDE, is generally accepted by most historians and biographers and is supported by the Portuguese stay behind Gladio-esque army, known as Aginter Press, that suggested in 1990 that they were responsible for the assassination. Initially, due to the uncertainty regarding <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>responsible,</b> Mondlane's death created great suspicion within the ranks of the FRELIMO itself and a short power struggle which resulted in a dramatic swing to the political left.|$|E
5|$|Sir Edward's {{choice of}} {{architect}} is unknown, {{although it has}} been attributed to the mason William Arnold, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>responsible</b> for the designs of Cranborne Manor and Wadham College, Oxford, and had worked at Dunster Castle, also in Somerset. Dunster has architectural motifs similar to those found at Montacute. Phelips chose as the site for his new mansion a spot close by the existing house, built by his father. The date work commenced is undocumented, but is generally thought to be c.1598/9, based on dates on a fireplace and in stained glass within the house. The date 1601, engraved above a doorcase, is considered to be the date of completion.|$|E
5|$|Sir Jeffrey Wyatville, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>responsible,</b> under King George IV, for the {{rebuilding}} of Windsor Castle, enlarged the house in 1828 at a proposed cost of £4000. Additions included an octagonal dining room in the north-east side, in which the King regularly had dinner. A three storey annex was added for the accommodation of the Bombardier, with a new wall linking a heightened turret to which a large flagpole was added. The addition of further Gothic details enhanced the interior and exterior of the fort in 1829. The fort is built of brick with an applied wash that imitated the appearance of stone.|$|E

5|$|The move of {{the company}} of the 45th Battalion down the exposed slope was disastrous, {{possibly}} as the company commander had not been advised of the particular difficulties involved. Moving in artillery formation, they were shelled and came under intense machine gun fire, suffering 11 killed and 37 wounded. The survivors scrambled to the embankment in small groups. Although the Official History is silent on <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>responsible</b> for this debacle, in his notebooks, the Official Historian, Charles Bean, blamed Imlay.|$|E
5|$|The {{periscopes}} had two problems, {{the first}} of which was shared with the other masts. They were not streamlined; raising a periscope while moving would create enough drag and turbulence to shake the entire submarine. As with many elements of the submarine, there were disagreements as to <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>responsible</b> for the problem. It was solved by modifying the masts to redirect the water flow around them (for example, a spiral wrap was fixed around the head of each periscope).|$|E
