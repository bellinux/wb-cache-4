5|$|Bauer's {{favorite}} subject was Swedish nature, the dense forests {{where the light}} trickled down through the tree canopies. Ever since he was little he had wandered in the dark <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> Småland imagining all the creatures living there. His paintings frequently included detailed depictions of plants, mosses, lichens and mushrooms found in the Swedish woods. He {{is best known for}} his illustrations of Among Gnomes and Trolls.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{comes from}} a family in which {{almost all of the}} men are larger than average, {{especially}} his great uncle Chudd, who was 6ft 7 in, weighed approximately 500lb, never had a pair of manufactured shoes, and was known as the strongest man in the Piney <b>Woods</b> <b>of</b> East Texas.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{mentions}} of fishers in literature occurred in The Audubon Book of True Nature Stories. Robert Snyder relates a tale of his encounter with fishers in the <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> the Adirondack Mountains of New York. He recounts three sightings, including one where he witnessed a fisher attacking a porcupine.|$|E

5000|$|Glyptotermes minutus, is {{a species}} <b>of</b> damp <b>wood</b> termite <b>of</b> the genus Glyptotermes. It {{is found in}} Sri Lanka. It is a pest <b>of</b> dead <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> Albizia saman and dead <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> Cupressus knightiana.|$|R
50|$|Larvae {{have been}} reared from dead <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> Pittosporum tenuifolium and Fuchsia excorticata and dead {{standing}} <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> a Coprosma species (probably Coprosma grandifolia).|$|R
5|$|The day was hot, 87°F (31°C) by one account, and humid, and the Confederates {{suffered}} {{under the}} hot sun and from the Union counter-battery fire as they awaited the order to advance. When Union cannoneers overshot their targets, they often hit the massed infantry waiting in the <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> Seminary Ridge or in the shallow depressions just behind Alexander's guns, causing significant casualties before the charge began.|$|E
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically in 1904 by American mycologist Charles Horton Peck as Boletus rugosiceps. The type collection {{was made in}} the <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> Port Jefferson, New York. Rolf Singer transferred it to Leccinum in 1945. Synonyms include Krombholzia rugosiceps, published by Rolf Singer in 1942, and Krombholziella rugosiceps, published by Josef Šutara in 1982. Krombholzia and Krombholziella are now obsolete genera that have since been subsumed into Leccinum.|$|E
5|$|With the {{conclusion}} of the fighting, however, military budgets were slashed, and even the forts that were designated for second- and first-class status were deemed surplus. The guns were removed, surplus equipment sold, and the land returned to its original owners. Fort Stanton itself was officially closed on March 20, 1866. Following the closure, the fort was abandoned to the elements, and the <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> Anacostia rapidly reclaimed the land.|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of parent cell walls in normal <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> Cedrus deodara and compression <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> Araucaria cookii and Pinus halepensis was studied under the electron microscope. Only {{part of the}} parent cell wall traversing the intercellular space was visible in compression <b>wood</b> trachieds <b>of</b> A. cookii and P. halepensis while parent wall can be seen between two splitted radial rows of trachieds in the normal <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> C. deodara...|$|R

5|$|As reviewers would note, the {{production}} {{was not without}} its faults. One error occurred with the photographer improperly taking pictures of the mermaid. The developed photographs of the mermaid were also impossible given the distances involved. A more minor error {{in the operation of}} the hotel was given by the office boy who handled the arriving guests with remarkable speed. Despite these errors, the company was {{at the forefront of the}} Independent producers and given great praise by Frank E. <b>Woods</b> <b>of</b> the American Biograph Company in The New York Dramatic Mirror.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the French {{government}} made an official investigation, concluding {{that it was}} possible that the aircraft had reached Newfoundland. In 1989, the NBC television series Unsolved Mysteries advanced the theory that the two aviators made it across the ocean, but crashed and perished in the <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> Maine. One of Nungesser's relatives, William Nungesser, made several trips to Maine to search, focusing his energies around the north slope of Round Lake Hills in Washington County, Maine, as well as the area around Lake Winnipesaukee.|$|E
5|$|In Winter of the Fisher, Cameron Langford relates {{a fictional}} {{encounter}} between a fisher and an aging recluse {{living in the}} forest. The recluse frees the fisher from a trap and nurses it back to health. The fisher tolerates the attention, but being a wild animal, returns to the forest when well enough. Langford uses the ecology and known habits of the fisher to weave a tale of survival and tolerance in the northern <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> Canada.|$|E

50|$|Their larvae feed on <b>wood,</b> mostly <b>of</b> Araucariaceae. Certain Belini larvae also {{feed on the}} <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> Fabaceae, {{while some}} Agnesiotidini take the <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> Myrtaceae. Some Pachyurini larvae eat the {{developing}} fruits of Nothofagaceae. Like all Belini, they prefer diseased or dying plants or deadwood to healthy plants.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the physical and mechanical properties of branch, stem and root <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> iroko (Milicia excelsa) and emire (Terminalia ivorensis). The basic density, MOE and MOR were determined in accordance with BS 373 : 1957. Fifty samples from the <b>wood</b> types <b>of</b> each species were used for each test. The study showed that the root <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> iroko and emire exhibited the highest basic density of 760 and 620 kg/m 3, respectively, while the basic densities of the branch and stem <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> emire (537 kg/m 3) were comparable. The differences in the MOE values among the <b>wood</b> types <b>of</b> iroko and emire {{were found to be}} statistically insignificant. The MOR value <b>of</b> the branch <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> emire (73 MPa) was found to be significantly higher than that <b>of</b> the stem <b>wood</b> (71 MPa). However, {{there was no significant difference}} between the MOR values of the branch and stem <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> iroko (67 MPa). Basic density <b>of</b> all <b>wood</b> types was found to be a good predictor of MOE in static. With exception <b>of</b> the root <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> emire, significant but low correlations were found for the regression relationships between MOE and MOR. For the emire stem wood, MOE explained about 41 % of the variation in the MOR <b>of</b> that <b>wood</b> type. The study concludes that it is possible to substitute the branch and root <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> iroko and emire for stem wood in many applications...|$|R
5|$|Moving west, {{the troop}} {{followed}} the division {{as it took}} positions in the Saar-Moselle Triangle, facing the Siegfried Switch Line on 7 January 1945, and shifted to the offensive on 14 January, seizing Tettingen and Butzdorf that day. The following day, the Nennigberg-Wies area was wrested from the German army, but heavy counterattacks followed and Butzdorf, Berg, and most of Nennig changed hands several times before being finally secured. On 20 January, an unsuccessful battalion attack against Orscholz, eastern terminus of the switch position, cost the division most of two companies. In early February, the division, with troop in tow, took the <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> Campholz and later Sinz.|$|E
5|$|NY421 {{begins at}} a dead end south of the hamlet of Horseshoe in an {{isolated}} part {{of the town of}} Piercefield. Here, the highway connects to a pair of dirt roads, one of which leads north alongside Horseshoe Lake to Horseshoe. The two-lane route heads eastward from the trails, following the southern shore of Horseshoe Lake while traversing the deep <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> Adirondack Park. At the southeastern end of the lake, NY421 turns northeastward, crossing a small stream feeding into the lake before curving back toward the east. For the next , the road passes through unabated wilderness as it heads toward the western shoreline of Tupper Lake.|$|E
5|$|Stories {{were told}} of Boone making one last visit to Kentucky {{to pay off}} his creditors, {{although}} {{some or all of}} these tales may be folklore. American painter John James Audubon claimed to have gone hunting with Boone in the <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> Kentucky around 1810. Years later, Audubon painted a portrait of Boone, supposedly from memory, although skeptics have noted the similarity of this painting to the well-known portraits by Chester Harding. Boone's family insisted he never returned to Kentucky after 1799, although some historians believe Boone visited his brother Squire near Kentucky in 1810 and have therefore reported Audubon's story as factual.|$|E
5000|$|The fossil wood may be {{the only}} part of the plant that has been preserved, with the rest of the plant {{completely}} unknown: therefore such wood may get a special kind of botanical name. This will usually include [...] "xylon" [...] and a term indicating its presumed affinity, such as Araucarioxylon (<b>wood</b> <b>of</b> Araucaria or some related genus), Palmoxylon (<b>wood</b> <b>of</b> an indeterminate palm), or Castanoxylon (<b>wood</b> <b>of</b> an indeterminate chinkapin).|$|R
50|$|The <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> Handroanthus {{brings a}} high price. The <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> other species is {{sometimes}} fraudulently sold as Handroanthus. By 2007, FSC-certified ipê wood had become readily {{available on the}} market, although certificates are occasionally forged.|$|R
50|$|Six forest {{units of}} {{installation}} (UFA) {{are in the}} course of exploitation by several companies, of which Processing industry <b>of</b> the <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> Likouala (ITBL) and Likouala-Timber. Likouala currently occupies the first place in the production <b>of</b> <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> Congo.|$|R
5|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} scientifically as Boletus viscosus by American mycologist Charles Frost in 1874. In 1885, Charles Horton Peck, who had found specimens in pine <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> Albany County, New York, {{explained that the}} species name was a taxonomic homonym (Boletus viscosus was already in use for another species named by Ventenat in 1863), and so renamed it to Boletus brevipes. Its current name was assigned by German Otto Kuntze in 1898. William Alphonso Murrill renamed it as Rostkovites brevipes in 1948; the genus Rostkovites is now considered to be synonymous with Suillus.|$|E
5|$|There are {{numerous}} common liverworts such as Conocephalum conicum and Marchantia polymorpha. Autumn Flapwort (Jamesoniella autumnali), a nationally scarce species most {{commonly found in}} the sessile oak <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> western Scotland, was discovered at a site on Ben Lomond in 2008. The species is named after the Scottish botanist, William Jameson. Northern prongwort is an endemic liverwort found only in the Beinn Eighe nature reserve. The high Cairngorms provide sites {{for a variety of}} other unusual liverworts including Marsupella arctica, the European distribution of which is confined to two sites here and Svalbard.|$|E
5|$|At night, a carnivorous, shape-shifting alien named Kator {{lands in}} the <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> rural England. The vanguard of an {{invasion}} force, his mission is to evaluate the suitability of humans {{as a source of}} food for his species. Stumbling across Anderson and Sandy, a couple having a tryst in their parked car, he kills both and assumes the appearance of Anderson. The next morning, he encounters Jessica-Ann and Josephine, a lesbian couple who live in a nearby manor house. Although Jessica owns the property, having inherited it from her Canadian parents, the dominant of the pair is Jo, who is unusually possessive of Jessica and deeply suspicious of men. Simon, Jessica's boyfriend, has mysteriously disappeared. The women are vegetarians and live in seclusion with only a few chickens and a pet parrot, Wally, for company.|$|E
5000|$|The {{process was}} devised by Charles <b>Wood</b> <b>of</b> Lowmill, Egremont in Cumberland {{and his brother}} John <b>Wood</b> <b>of</b> Wednesbury and {{patented}} by them. The process was improved by John Wright and Joseph Jesson of West Bromwich, who also obtained a patent.|$|R

2500|$|Another Midrash {{explained}} that in [...] God chose acacia-wood – the <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> {{a tree that}} does not bear fruit – to build the Tabernacle {{to set an example}} for all time that people should not build houses with the <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> fruit-producing trees.|$|R
5|$|In the General Theory and later, Keynes {{responded to}} the socialists and left-wing liberals who argued, {{especially}} during the Great Depression of the 1930s, that capitalism caused war. He argued that if capitalism were managed domestically and internationally (with coordinated international Keynesian policies, an international monetary system that didn't pit the interests of countries against each other, and {{a high degree of}} freedom of trade), then this system of managed capitalism could promote peace rather than conflict between countries. His plans during World War II for post-war international economic institutions and policies (which contributed to the creation at Bretton <b>Woods</b> <b>of</b> the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and later {{to the creation of the}} General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and eventually the World Trade Organization) were aimed to give effect to this vision.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{began on}} 23 June as the English army {{attempted}} to force {{its way across}} the high ground of the Bannock Burn, which was surrounded by marshland. Skirmishing between the two sides broke out, resulting in the death of Sir Henry de Bohun, whom Robert killed in personal combat. Edward continued his advance the following day, and encountered the bulk of the Scottish army as they emerged from the <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> New Park. Edward appears not to have expected the Scots to give battle here, and as a result had kept his forces in marching, rather than battle, order, with the archers − who would usually have been used to break up enemy spear formations − {{at the back of his}} army, rather than the front. His cavalry found it hard to operate in the cramped terrain and were crushed by Robert's spearmen. The English army was overwhelmed and its leaders were unable to regain control.|$|E
5|$|The town {{developed}} {{around its}} 11th-century priory, a Benedictine monastery, {{the remains of}} which make {{up some of the}} early parts of Great Malvern Priory, now a large parish church. Several slightly different histories explain the actual founding of the religious community. Legend tells that the settlement began following the murder of St. Werstan, a monk of Deerhurst, who fled from the Danes and took refuge in the <b>woods</b> <b>of</b> Malvern, where the above-mentioned hermitage had been established. St Werstan's oratory is thought to have been located on the site of St Michael's Chapel which is believed to have stood on the site of Bello Sguardo, a Victorian Villa. Bello Sguardo was built on the site of Hermitage Cottage. The cottage was demolished in 1825 and ecclesiastical carvings were found within it. A Mediaeval undercroft, human bones and parts of a coffin were also uncovered. Although the legend may be monastic mythology, historians have however concluded that St. Werstan was the original martyr.|$|E

30|$|In {{the case}} of rather {{primitive}} angiosperms like Magnoliaceae, large cellulose content and low MFA seem to produce a similar effect as the formation of distinctive G-layer in highly evolved eudicot species [43]. However, the magnitude of tensile L stress in tension <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> those primitive species is somewhat lower than in typical tension <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> highly evolved eudicots species. As typical examples of primitive and evolved types, respectively, the L stress was 20  MPa at most in tension <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> a 51 -year-old yellow poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), equivalent to − 0.15 % of L strain [48], while tension <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> a 23 -year-old black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) generated a tensile L stress of 70  MPa corresponding to − 0.49 % of L strain (Fig.  9) [44].|$|R
50|$|The <b>Wood</b> <b>of</b> Beit, now the 'Moor of Beith', {{has been}} {{identified}} as an Arthurian site where according to Taliessin in a poem under the name of 'Canowan' it was the site of a battle in the <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> Beit {{at the close of the}} day.|$|R
