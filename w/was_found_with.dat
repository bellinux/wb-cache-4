5|$|In 1857 the {{mutilated}} {{body of a}} murdered {{woman was}} found in Nightingale Valley; the following year, John Beale was hanged at Taunton for the crime in January 1858. Another violent death occurred in 1948 when George Henry Chinnock, who {{had been living in}} the woods, <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> head injuries.|$|E
5|$|Police {{departments}} throughout Oregon {{decline to}} press charges, or {{charges have been}} dropped for possessing and growing marijuana, even for convicted drug dealers. Salem police estimated they received 30 or 40 calls for marijuana activity in 2007 which were not pursued because the grow operations were legal, even one next to a high school. One grower, a previously convicted felon, <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> evidence of making hash oil, which is not protected, though a grand jury did not indict him.|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} Whitechapel Road is notorious for the 19th century Whitechapel murders, which are {{believed}} to be linked to Jack the Ripper. One of the first victims was Martha Tabram, who <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> multiple stab wounds on George Yard Buildings, Whitechapel Road on 7 August 1888.|$|E

50|$|A single lone pair can <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> {{atoms in}} the {{nitrogen}} group such as nitrogen in ammonia, two lone pairs can <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> {{atoms in the}} chalcogen group such as oxygen in water and the halogens can carry three lone pairs such as in hydrogen chloride.|$|R
5|$|The {{possible}} Sinosauropteryx specimen GMV2124 (Sinosauropteryx?sp.) <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> three mammal jaws in its gut region. Hurum, Luo, and Kielan-Jaworowska (2006) {{identified two}} of these jaws as belonging to Zhangheotherium and the third to Sinobaatar, showing that these two mammals {{were part of the}} animal's diet. Zhangheotherium is known to have had a spur on the ankle, like the modern platypus, which would indicate that Sinosauropteryx fed on possibly venomous mammals.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species are}} omnivorous, eating fruit, flowers, buds, insect excretions, tree gums, large insects, spiders, frogs, chameleons, snakes, small birds, and eggs. Coquerel's giant mouse lemur {{is thought to}} opportunistically prey on mouse lemurs after an {{individual}} <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> a half-eaten gray mouse lemur (M.murinus) in a trap. During June and July, {{at the peak of}} the dry season, this species relies on sugary excretions from the larvae of hemipteran and cochineal insects as well as tree gums. The sugary excretions are obtained by either licking them from the back of the insect or collecting the crystallized sugars that accumulate beneath the insect colony. During this time of year, feeding on insect secretions can account for 60% of feeding activity. In contrast, the northern giant mouse lemur relies on cashew fruits during the dry season.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{smelting}} was independently {{invented in}} different places. It was probably discovered in China before 2800 BC, in Central America around 600 AD, and in West Africa about the 9th or 10th century AD. Investment casting {{was invented in}} 4500–4000 BC in Southeast Asia and carbon dating has established mining at Alderley Edge in Cheshire, UK, at 2280 to 1890 BC. Ötzi the Iceman, a male dated from 3300–3200 BC, <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> an axe with a copper head 99.7% pure; high levels of arsenic in his hair suggest an involvement in copper smelting. Experience with copper has assisted the development of other metals; in particular, copper smelting led {{to the discovery of}} iron smelting. Production in the Old Copper Complex in Michigan and Wisconsin is dated between 6000 and 3000 BC. Natural bronze, a type of copper made from ores rich in silicon, arsenic, and (rarely) tin, came into general use in the Balkans around 5500 BC.|$|E

25|$|The plant {{communities}} that <b>are</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> G. kennedyana {{have not been}} sufficiently studied. However, it is currently known to <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> the spiny fan-flower (Scaevola spinescens), whitewood (Atalaya hemiglauca), Acacia and Eremophila species and occasionally black oak (Casuarina pauper). A low ground cover of chenopodiaceae is often present.|$|R
50|$|Long-tailed voles can <b>be</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> unusual dentition. A female <b>with</b> grooved incisors <b>was</b> <b>found</b> in the Yukon. Several other voles from Oregon <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> {{flattened}} incisors and malocclusion {{of their}} incisors and molars. A specimen in New Mexico was reported {{with an extra}} tooth in the right lower jaw. An albino vole <b>was</b> also <b>found</b> in New Mexico.|$|R
5|$|In the United States {{only two}} {{fatalities}} were reported between 2000 and 2004, including {{a man who}} died in North Carolina of barotrauma in 2002. A youth asphyxiated in Vancouver during 2003, and a 27-year-old man in Australia had an embolism after breathing from a cylinder in 2000. Since then two adults asphyxiated in South Florida in 2006, and there were cases in 2009 and 2010, one a Californian youth who <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> a bag over his head, attached to a helium tank, and another teenager in Northern Ireland died of asphyxiation. At Eagle Point, Oregon a teenage girl died in 2012 from barotrauma at a party. A girl from Michigan died from hypoxia later in the year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} letter to Tacitus, Pliny the Younger {{suggested}} that his uncle's death {{was due to the}} reaction of his weak lungs to a cloud of poisonous, sulphurous gas that wafted over the group. However, Stabiae was 16km from the vent (roughly where the modern town of Castellammare di Stabia is situated) and his companions were apparently unaffected by the volcanic gases, and so {{it is more likely that}} the corpulent Pliny died from some other cause, such as a stroke or heart attack. His body <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> no apparent injuries on the next day, after dispersal of the plume.|$|E
5|$|On 3 June, Van der Sloot {{was arrested}} near Curacaví by the Investigations Police of Chile while {{traveling}} {{in a rented}} taxi on Highway 68 between the coastal city of Viña del Mar and the capital of Santiago. He <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> a laptop, foreign currency, a business card case, detailed charts of ocean currents around Lima, and bloody clothes. His phone's SIM card was missing, which made mobile phone tracking of his location impossible. He told Chilean police that unidentified armed robbers hid {{in the hotel room}} and killed Flores when she disobeyed their order to be quiet. Van der Sloot's Dutch attorney claimed that his client {{was on his way to}} Santiago to turn himself in. He was subsequently expelled and transported by Chilean police in a Cessna 310 back to Arica to be handed over to Peruvian authorities at the Chacalluta border crossing on 4 June.|$|E

5|$|On August 8, 2009, {{an adult}} male {{passenger}} {{was rushed to}} a hospital after he <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> breathing problems following the ride. He died the same evening. The Hamilton County Coroner's Office reported that a heart condition was the likely cause of death and ruled it natural. The ride was re-opened at 12:10 pm on August 9, 2009, after an inspection by the Ohio Department of Agriculture – {{a division of the}} state government responsible for amusement park ride safety in Ohio. They determined the ride was operating within the manufacturer's specifications.|$|E
5|$|Other proffered {{explanations}} are the possible {{appearance of a}} displaced iceberg; the fear of running aground while becalmed, and a sudden seaquake. Hydrographical evidence suggests that an iceberg drifting so far south was improbable, and had it done so other ships would have seen it. Begg gives more consideration to a theory that Mary Celeste, while becalmed, began drifting towards the Dollabarat reef off Santa Maria Island. The theory supposes that Briggs, fearing his ship would run aground, launched the yawl {{in the hope of}} reaching land. The wind could then have picked up and blown Mary Celeste away from the reef, while the rising seas swamped and sank the yawl. The weakness of this theory is that if the ship had been becalmed, all sails would have been set to catch any available breeze, yet the ship <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> many of its sails furled.|$|E
5|$|PC Blakelock {{had been}} {{assigned}} {{on the night of}} his death to Serial 502, a unit of 10 constables and one sergeant dispatched to protect firefighters. When the rioters forced the officers back, Blakelock stumbled and fell. Surrounded by a mob of 30–50 people, he received over 40 injuries inflicted by machetes or similar, and <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> a six-inch-long knife in his neck, buried up to the hilt. He was the first constable to be killed in a riot in Britain since 1833, when PC Robert Culley was stabbed to death in Clerkenwell, London.|$|E

5|$|Samonds {{also found}} Hipposideros {{material}} in other sites at Anjohibe, {{but did not}} assign it to H.besaoka. In Old SE, also at most 10,000 years old, a single fourth upper premolar (P4) <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> dimensions different from those seen in both H.commersoni and H.besaoka and lacking a cusp on the front lingual (inner) corner, present in both other species; Samonds assigned this specimen to Hipposideros sp. cf. H.commersoni. In NCC-1 (estimated 69,600 to 86,800 years old), a lower incisor and a third lower molar (m3) were found; these teeth resemble H.commersoni and are distinct from H.besaoka, so Samonds assigned them to the former species. Locality SS2, {{which could not be}} dated, contained a few teeth and isolated jaws of Hipposideros. Some of these showed measurements distinct from both Hipposideros species, rendering the assignment of the material doubtful; Samonds referred it to H. sp. cf. H.commersoni.|$|E
5|$|Shay {{was found}} dead in a Kansas City hotel room on December 1, 1927. He <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> a gunshot wound to the head. Police {{officials}} initially said that the manner of death could have been either suicide or murder. Shay stayed in his room on the day that he died. A porter went to check on him that evening and found him on the floor with a pistol a few inches from his right hand. When physicians examined Shay's body, they found that a bullet had entered the right ear and exited the back of the head. Shay had lost the use of his right arm and hand after a stroke. Police said that if Shay were holding the gun in his left hand, {{it would not have been}} easy for him to shoot himself in the right side of the head.|$|E
5|$|The attacking {{force has}} the natural {{advantage}} {{at the start}} of each game, likely indicating an important cultural aspect by mimicking the success of Viking raids. Another cultural indication of the king is that importance of the Viking chiefs' presence in battle. Although the kings of Europe later claimed divine rule and sat upon the throne rather than being a physical presence on the battlefield, it was essential for a Viking chief to be considered an equal in war. The importance of war is also reflected in Hnefatafl because it is a war strategy game, which can indicate an important reason why the gaming boards have been found with males of all ages. In Balnakeil, a male skeleton between the ages of 8 and 13 <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> weapons and a Hnefatafl board game. Vikings tended to take boys onto the battlefield with them, which explains why young boys also played these war-strategic board games.|$|E

5|$|The finder {{discovered}} the helmet and visor buried together some 25cm (10in) below the surface, {{at a site}} located on a ledge {{at the lower end}} of the settlement. It had been placed onto two stone slabs at the bottom of a hole which had been back-filled with soil. A stone cap had been laid on top. The helmet was found in 33 large fragments and 34 small fragments and had apparently been folded before burial. The visor was mostly intact and had been placed face down. The griffin had become detached and <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> the helmet. No other artefacts were found at the time, but the subsequent Tullie House/PAS excavations at the findspot discovered a number of copper and iron objects, a bead and two Roman coins dating to 330–337. The coins were found within the artificial stone feature in which the helmet had been deposited and may have been buried at the same time.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} found that crewing {{of the train}} was insufficient. There was no traction inspector on board. WCRC had discontinued the use of traction inspectors by 2012. A traction inspector's duties include assisting the driver with the sighting of signals. Two members of the train support crew were also on the footplate of Tangmere, {{but they had no}} responsibility in respect of the operation of the train. No problems were found with the ability to sight signals SN43 and SN45. The locomotive and carriages from the train were tested separately following the incident; no fault <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> either, although some of the sensors were not being recorded by the On Train Data Recorder (OTDR). The RAIB were able to reconstruct the sequence of events from the data that was recorded by the OTDR.|$|E
5|$|The {{teeth were}} long and slender, {{as opposed to the}} usually very short teeth seen in other abelisaurids. On each side of the upper jaws there were four premaxillary and twelve maxillary teeth, while the lower jaws were {{equipped}} with fifteen dentary teeth per side. In contrast to the robust-looking skull, the lower jaw was shallow and weakly constructed, with the dentary (the foremost jaw bone) connected to the hindmost jaw bones by only two contact points. The lower jaw <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>with</b> hyoid bones, in the position they would be in if the animal was alive. These slender bones, supporting the tongue musculature and several other muscles, are rarely found in dinosaurs because they are not connected to other bones and therefore get lost easily.|$|E
