5|$|As at Oak Ridge, {{the most}} {{difficulty}} was encountered while canning the uranium slugs, which commenced at Hanford in March 1944. They were pickled to remove dirt and impurities, dipped in molten bronze, tin, and aluminum-silicon alloy, canned using hydraulic presses, and then capped using arc welding under an argon atmosphere. Finally, they {{were subjected to}} a series of tests to detect holes or faulty welds. Disappointingly, most canned slugs initially failed the tests, resulting in an output {{of only a handful of}} canned slugs per day. But steady progress was made and by June 1944 production increased to the point where it appeared that enough canned slugs <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> start Reactor B on schedule in August 1944.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{legislative}} walkouts, the assembly began passing {{most of the}} agenda and Daniels signed the bills into law. Written in collaboration with Indiana Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Bennett, a series of education reform laws made a variety of major changes to statewide public schools. A statewide school voucher program was enacted. Children in homes with an income under $41,000 could receive vouchers equal to 90% {{of the cost of}} their public school tuition and use that money to attend a private school. It provides lesser benefits to households with income over $41,000. The program will be gradually phased in over a three-year period and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> all state residents by 2014.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006 it was {{announced}} that the festival was in financial crisis and there was uncertainty over whether the 2007 event would take place.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the presiding magistrate, several additional magistrates were often present to act as assistants. There were also religious officials known as augurs either in attendance or on-call, who <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> help interpret any signs from the gods (omens). On several known occasions, presiding magistrates used the claim of unfavorable omens {{as an excuse to}} suspend a session that was not going the way they wanted. Any decision made by a presiding magistrate could be vetoed by a magistrate known as a Plebeian Tribune. In addition, decisions made by presiding magistrates could also be vetoed by higher-ranking magistrates.|$|E

5|$|Tyresö {{announced}} in August 2013 {{that they had}} agreed a deal to re-sign Engen {{at the end of}} her Liverpool contract.

Although never officially changed, some of the proposed names included: Rhythm from New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial and Angels from Louisiana Governor Edwin Edwards. After speculation as to where the team would play their home games while a new arena was constructed, Superdome officials notified the league that enough dates <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> schedule 41 home games at the dome for the 1994–95 season.

5|$|A {{principal}} cast of six actors received star billing in the show's first season. Poehler {{portrayed the}} lead character, Leslie Knope, the naive but well-meaning, eager-to-please {{deputy director of}} the parks and recreation department of the fictional town of Pawnee, Indiana. Also among the cast were Aziz Ansari as Tom Haverford, a sarcastic parks department employee, and Rashida Jones as Ann Perkins, a nurse who befriends Leslie and tries to help her turn a giant construction pit into a park. Daniels and Schur intended to cast Ansari and Jones (who previously appeared in The Office as Karen Filippelli) from the series' earliest stages of development, but the ultimate Parks and Recreation concept did not coalesce until they learned Poehler <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> star. After her recruitment, the general concept of the series was established and the script for the pilot episode was written.|$|E
5|$|On February 17, 1944, Zoldak {{was traded}} along with Barney Lutz to the St. Louis Browns for Frankie Hayes, as the Athletics wanted a veteran {{to add to}} their roster, while the Browns wanted the two {{prospects}} as they were classified as 4-F, and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> the team {{for the duration of}} the war. He impressed the Browns coaching staff in spring training, and as a result was named to the opening day roster. Zoldak made his major league debut on May 13, and was used as a reliever during his first season, pitching in 18 games and earning an ERA of 3.72. The Browns made it to the 1944 World Series, but Zoldak did not see any action. He played in 26 games during the 1945 season, earning a 3-2 record with an ERA of 3.36. In his final appearance of the season on September 29 against the Cleveland Indians, he was given the opportunity to start a game opposite Bob Feller. In a six-inning game shortened by rain, Zoldak and the Browns won, 21.|$|E
5|$|Before Maria's arrival, {{tropical}} storm watches were issued {{for most of}} the Lesser Antilles on September8; the watches were upgraded to {{tropical storm}} warnings at 2230UTC. On the following day, Puerto Rico and many of the U.S. Virgin Islands and British Virgin Islands were placed under a tropical storm watch. The watches and warnings for the islands were discontinued around 1500UTC on September10, after the strong thunderstorms diminished from Maria's center. The storm's effects on the island of Puerto Rico were primarily in the form of heavy rainfall. Flood waters near Patillas, Puerto Rico, destroyed several homes and bridges, causing $1.3 million (2011 USD) in damage. In the surrounding city of Yabucoa, Puerto Rico, heavy rainfall flooded and damaged around 150 homes. Many people were forced to relocate after rainfall and mud filled their homes. Near the city of Naguabo, Puerto Rico, the car of a 60-year-old woman was swept away by flood waters on a road. After becoming tangled in bushes, the woman was {{able to get out of}} her car and pulled to safety. Nearly a month after the storm, U.S. president Barack Obama announced that federal disaster aid <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> the island due to Maria.|$|E

5|$|In June 1944, Eichelberger {{was summoned}} to Sixth Army {{headquarters}} by Krueger. The Battle of Biak, where the 41st Infantry Division had landed in May, was going badly, and the airfields that MacArthur had promised <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> support the Battle of Saipan were not in American hands. Eichelberger found that the Japanese, who were present in larger numbers than originally reported, were ensconced in caves overlooking the airfield sites. While the Americans were better trained and equipped than at Buna, so too were the Japanese, who employed their new tactics of avoiding costly counterattacks and exacting the maximum toll for ground gained. After seeing the situation for himself, Eichelberger concluded that Fuller's 41st Infantry Division had not done too badly. Nonetheless, as at Buna, Eichelberger relieved a number of officers that he felt were not performing as the battle ground on. His orders were to supersede Fuller as task force commander rather than relieve him as division commander, but Fuller requested his own relief, and Krueger obliged him. On Eichelberger's recommendation, Fuller was replaced by Brigadier General Jens A. Doe. Krueger was unimpressed with Eichelberger's performance on Biak, concluding that Eichelberger's tactics were unimaginative, and no better than Fuller's, and may have delayed rather than expedited the capture of the island. On the other hand, MacArthur thought sufficiently highly of Eichelberger's performance to award him the Silver Star.|$|E
5|$|Pirlo did {{not play}} in the third group stage match against hosts Brazil, as he had come down with a minor injury {{at the end of}} the second match, {{although}} he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> play for the semi-finals. Italy were defeated 4–2 in the final group stage match on 22 June, which meant that they finished second in group A, and would be playing the winners of group B, tournament favourites Spain, in a rematch of the European Championship Final of the previous year. Italy held Spain to 0–0 draw on 27 June, as the match eventually went to penalties. Pirlo netted his penalty, but Bonucci's miss allowed Spain to advance to the final, as Italy lost the shootout 7–6. Pirlo was injured for the third place final, although Italy managed to defeat Uruguay 3–2 on penalties on 30 June, after a 2–2 draw. Pirlo was named to the Team of the Tournament, and was nominated for the Golden Ball award, although he failed to place amongst the top three players of the tournament, as the awards went to Neymar, Iniesta, and Paulinho, respectively.|$|E
