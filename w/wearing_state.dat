[...] A very cruel letter in some ways it was, representing that he had acquiesced in her judgment, that there were certain unfortunate passages in his past life which made it her painful duty to prevent her child from following the dictates of an inexperienced heart. Then she put it to him whether it were not a most unfortunate position for a young girl to be involved in an engagement which could never be fulfilled, and which was contrary to the commands of her only remaining parent, and she showed how family peace, confidence, and maternal and filial affection must suffer if the daughter should hold fast persistently to the promise by which she held herself bound. In fact, it was an urgent entreaty, for Viola's own sake, that he would release her from her promise. Dermot was shooting at Erymanth, and neither he nor I knew of this letter till Harold had acted. He rode at once to Arked, saw Lady Diana, and declared himself convinced that the engagement, having no chance of sanction, ought to be given up. Rather than keep Viola in the <b>wearing</b> <b>state</b> of resistance and disobedience her mother described, he would resign all hopes of her.|$|E

The method to prepare the sleeve basic pattern was based on the cylindrical surface development method, and the sleeve basic pattern covering the 45 and 90 degrees momentum of the arm-movement was made by using the cast-type body surface development figure prepared with the horizontal line of the sleeve hem placed horizontally in the plan and by combining the cast-type body surface development figure in the standing position with the figure in the moving position.

40|$|The {{deterioration}} {{observed in}} many industrial systems may be modeled in two phases. In the first phase, a {{period during which}} the system operates fault free ends with entry into a <b>worn</b> <b>state.</b> In the second phase, the system spends time in the <b>worn</b> <b>state</b> prior to failure. Should the system be found {{to be in the}} <b>worn</b> <b>state</b> upon inspection, failure can be pre-empted by preventive maintenance. Transitions into the <b>worn</b> <b>state</b> occur more frequently as the system ages, as does the cost of maintaining the system. The goal of analysis is the design of cost-effective policies for the inspection, maintenance, and renewal of such systems. The paper extends previous work by offering a choice between a (cheap) repair and a (more expensive) renewal of the system, should it be found to be in the <b>worn</b> <b>state</b> upon inspection. The decision-maker may also renew the system at any time without inspection. We propose simple, cost effective heuristic policies, whose design avoids the computational complexities of a full dynamic programming (DP) solution. The closeness to optimality of these policies is investigated, as is their sensitivity to parameter misspecification.

40|$|Why has {{disability}} remained {{outside of}} the focus of most cultural historians in German studies? ” asks Brown University German studies Professor Carol Poore in her comprehensive and nuanced new book, Disability in Twentieth-Century German Culture. While cultural representations of disability have been central to specific topics in German history – most notably the development of eugenics and the social welfare system for disabled workers – {{there has been no}} comprehensive study weaving together the different discourses of disability in German society until Poore’s important contribution. Informed by critical disability studies, Poore uses an impressive range of texts and resources to match the cultural representations of disability with the way that Germans with disabilities themselves responded to and resisted that representation. The result is an intensely readable, richly illustrated, and thought-provoking read for students of disability studies, German culture, and contemporary bioethics. A large part of the book’s attention goes {{to the development of the}} Nazi eugenic ideology. This is perhaps an inevitable focus of a book on disability in Germany, even though much has been written about the subject already. Poore provides the important cultural background to understanding National Socialism’s contempt for “useless eaters ” and “lives unworthy of life ” by tracing metaphors of the disabled body back to the Weimar Republic, where images of the disabled veteran in both art and politics symbolized both Germany’s humiliating defeat in World War I as well as Germany’s fascination with modernism. It is no coincidence that this period provided the foundation for Germany’s unrivalled leadership in physical and vocational rehabilitation. The compelling image here is that of a quadruple amputee war veteran <b>wearing</b> <b>state</b> of the art prostheses on both arms and legs while working as a skilled craftsman (p...|$|E
40|$|Monitoring {{of metal}} cutting tool <b>wear</b> <b>states</b> {{is a key}} {{technology}} for automatic, unmanned and adaptive machining. As tool wear increases, the vibration signals of cutting tool {{become more and more}} irregular in the turning processes. The degree of tool wear can be indirectly monitored according to these changes of vibration signals. In order to quantitatively describe these changes, fractal theory and fuzzy clustering method were introduced into the cutting tool wear monitoring area. Firstly, wavelet de-noising method was used to reduce the noise of original signals, and eliminate the effect of noise on fractal dimensions. Secondly, the fractal dimensions based on fractal theory were got from the de-noised signals, including box dimension, information dimension, and correlation dimension. Finally, the relationship between the fractal dimensions and tool <b>wear</b> <b>states</b> was studied; the affinities between the known and unknown states can be obtained through fuzzy c-mean clustering algorithm; tool <b>wear</b> <b>states</b> can be recognized by those affinities based on fractal dimensions. The experiment results demonstrate that wavelet de-noising method can efficiently eliminate the effect of noise on fractal dimensions, and tool <b>wear</b> <b>states</b> can be real-timely and accurately recognized through the fuzzy clustering analysis on fractal dimensions. </p...|$|R

Aiming at the {{nonlinear}} {{characteristics of}} the tool wear Acoustic Emission signal, tool <b>wear</b> <b>state</b> identification method is proposed based on local linear embedding and vector machine supported. The local linear embedding algorithm makes high dimensional information down to low dimension feature space through commutation, and thus to compress the data for highlighting signal features. This algorithm well compensates for the weakness of linear dimension reduction failing to find datasets nonlinear structure. In this paper, acoustic emission signal is firstly made by phase space reconstruction. Using local linear embedding method, the high dimension space mapping data points are reflected into low-dimensional space corresponding data points, then extracting tool <b>wear</b> <b>state</b> characteristics, and using vector machine supported classifier to identify classification of the tool wear conditions.

40|$|The {{progress}} of surface metrology {{in the last}} decade has led to improved 3 D characterisation of surfaces which offers the possibility of monitoring manufacturing operations to give highly detailed information regarding the machine tool condition. This paper presents a case study where areal surface characterisation is used to monitor tool wear in peripheral milling. Due to the fact that tool wear has a direct effect on the machined workpiece surface, the machined surface topography contains much information concerning the machining conditions including the tool <b>wear</b> <b>state.</b> Through analysing the often subtle changes in the surface topography the tool <b>wear</b> <b>state</b> can be highlighted. This paper utilises areal surface characterization, areal auto-correlation function (AACF) and pattern analysis to illustrate the effect of tool wear on the workpiece surface. The result shows that: (1) tool wear, previously difficult to detect will influence almost all of the areal surface parameters; (2) the pattern features of AACF spectrum can reflect the subtle surface texture variation with increasing tool wear.

40|$|Tool {{condition}} monitoring (TCM) {{plays an important}} role in improving machining efficiency and guaranteeing workpiece quality. In order to realize reliable recognition of the tool condition, a robust classifier needs to be constructed to depict the relationship between tool <b>wear</b> <b>states</b> and sensory information. However, because of the complexity of the machining process and the uncertainty of the tool wear evolution, it is hard for a single classifier to fit all the collected samples without sacrificing generalization ability. In this paper, heterogeneous ensemble learning is proposed to realize tool {{condition monitoring}} in which the support vector machine (SVM), hidden Markov model (HMM) and radius basis function (RBF) are selected as base classifiers and a stacking ensemble strategy is further used to reflect the relationship between the outputs of these base classifiers and tool <b>wear</b> <b>states.</b> Based on the heterogeneous ensemble learning classifier, an online monitoring system is constructed in which the harmonic features are extracted from force signals and a minimal redundancy and maximal relevance (mRMR) algorithm is utilized to select the most prominent features. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, a titanium alloy milling experiment was carried out and samples with different tool <b>wear</b> <b>states</b> were collected to build the proposed heterogeneous ensemble learning classifier. Moreover, the homogeneous ensemble learning model and majority voting strategy are also adopted to make a comparison. The analysis and comparison results show that the proposed heterogeneous ensemble learning classifier performs better in both classification accuracy and stability...|$|R

One of the major design problems in multiple application domains is the mismatch between workloads and resources. Sub-optimal assignment of workloads to resources can cause underloaded or overloaded resources, resulting in performance degradation or energy waste. This work specifically focuses on the heterogeneity in system hardware components and workloads. It includes energy management solutions for unregulated or batteryless embedded systems; and data center servers with heterogeneous workloads, machines, and processor <b>wear</b> <b>states.</b> This thesis describes four major contributions: (1) This thesis describes a battery test and energy delivery system design process to maintain battery life in embedded systems without voltage regulators. (2) In battery-less sensor nodes, this thesis demonstrates a routing protocol to maintain reliable transmission through the sensor network. (3) This thesis has characterized typical workloads and developed two models to capture the heterogeneity of data center tasks and machines: a task performance model and a machine resource utilization model. These models allow users to predict task finish time on individual machines. It then integrates these two models into a task scheduler based on the Hadoop framework for MapReduce tasks, and uses this scheduler for server energy minimization using task concentration. (4) In addition to saving server energy consumption, this thesis describes a method of reducing data center cooling energy by maintaining optimal server processor temperature setpoints through a task assignment algorithm. This algorithm considers the reliability impact of processor <b>wear</b> <b>states.</b> It records processor <b>wear</b> <b>states</b> through automatic timing slack tests on a cluster of machines with varying core temperatures, voltages, and frequencies.
