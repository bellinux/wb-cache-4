40|$|Engineering {{properties}} such as compaction, unconfined compressive strength, consistency limits, percentage swell, free swell index, the California bearing {{ratio and}} {{the consolidation of}} bentonite stabilized with lime and phosphogypsum are presented in this paper. The content of the lime and phosphogypsum varied from 0 to 10 %. The results reveal that the dry unit weight and optimum moisture content of bentonite + 8 % lime increased <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> 8 % phosphogypsum. The percentage of swell increased and the free swell index decreased <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> 8 % phosphogypsum to the bentonite + 8 % lime mix. The unconfined compressive strength of the bentonite + 8 % lime increased <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> 8 % phosphogypsum {{as well as an}} increase in the curing period up to 14 days. The liquid limit and plastic limit of the bentonite + 8 % lime increased, whereas the plasticity index remained constant <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> 8 % phosphogypsum. The California bearing ratio, modulus of subgrade reaction, and secant modulus increased for <b>the</b> bentonite stabilized <b>with</b> lime and phosphogypsum.

5|$|Fortifications {{and other}} {{structures}} {{were built in}} the rural villages under Zahir's control. In Deir Hanna, Zahir's brother Sa'd built a large fortress and an adjacent mosque, both of which were severely damaged during a siege by Jazzar Pasha in 1776. In Khirbat Jiddin, he rebuilt the demolished Crusader fortress <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mosque and hamaam (bathhouse). The mosque was destroyed by Israeli forces when the village was captured during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. In Shefa-'Amr, Zahir's son Uthman built a large fortress with four towers, of which one remains standing. Another of his sons, Ahmad, rebuilt the Crusader fortress in Saffuriya.|$|E

5|$|ILM was {{tasked with}} imagining what the {{immediate}} assimilation of an Enterprise crewmember would look like. Jaeger {{came up with}} a set of cables that sprang from the Borg's knuckles and buried themselves in the crewmember's neck. Wormlike tubes would course through the victim's body and mechanical devices break the skin. The entire transformation was created using computer-generated imagery. The wormlike geometry was animated over the actor's face, then blended in <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> skin texture over the animation. The gradual change in skin tone was simulated with shaders.|$|E
5|$|In 1518, in {{the absence}} of Adam Gordon, the castle was {{captured}} by Alexander Sutherland, the legitimate heir to the Earldom of Sutherland. The Gordons quickly retook the castle, captured Alexander and placed his head on a spear on top of the castle tower. Alexander's son John made an attempt on the castle in 1550, but was killed in the castle garden. During the more peaceful 17th century, the keep was extended <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large house, built around a courtyard to the south-west.|$|E
5|$|In 1664 {{the mill}} {{partially}} burned down. It was rebuilt and, {{in order to}} recover from the losses, the miller did not have to pay taxes for the next 15 years. In 1764 another fire destroyed the entire mill, according to an ordenance from the States General after the miller requested assistance. The mill was rebuilt <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> second water wheel. The larger building was a gristmill and the smaller building an oil mill. In 1909 a sawmill was added to the larger building, and for a period the smaller building also acted as a fulling mill.|$|E

40|$|Microscopic {{structures}} and dynamics of aqueous salt solutions were investigated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ultrafast vibrational energy exchange method and anisotropy measurements. In KSCN aqueous solutions of various concentrations, the rotational time constants of SCN- anions are {{proportional to the}} viscosities of the solutions. However, the reorientation dynamics of the water molecules are only slightly affected by <b>the</b> solution viscosity. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> strongly hydrated F- anions, the rotations of both SCN- anions and water molecules slow down. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> weakly hydrated I- anions, only the rotation of SCN- anions slows down with that of water molecules unaffected. Vibrational energy exchange measurements show that the separation among SCN- anions decreases <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> F- and increases <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> I-. <b>The</b> series of experiments clearly demonstrate that both {{structures and}} dynamics of ion and water are segregated in the strong electrolyte aqueous solutions...|$|R
5|$|In 1999, NASA {{contracted}} Emerson {{to build}} a knife for use on Space Shuttle missions and the International Space Station. Rather than design a new model from scratch, NASA chose an existing model which already met their specifications, with one additional design requirement. The model is a folding version of the Specwar knife that Emerson had designed for Timberline <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> guthook cut into the tantō point of the blade with which astronauts could open their freeze dried food packages.

5|$|Of {{the four}} major {{elements}} in seawater – hydrogen, oxygen, sodium, and chlorine – only sodium takes on intense, short-term radioactivity <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single neutron to its nucleus: common sodium-23 becomes radioactive sodium-24, with a 15-hour half-life. In six days its intensity drops a thousandfold, but the corollary of short half-life is high initial intensity. Other isotopes were produced from seawater: hydrogen-3 (half-life 12 years) from hydrogen-2, oxygen-17 (stable) from oxygen-16, and chlorine-36 (301 thousand years) from chlorine-35, and some trace elements, but due to low abundance or low short-term intensity (long half-life) they were considered insignificant compared with sodium-24.|$|E
5|$|Similar alloys <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>addition</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{small amount}} of lead can be {{cold-rolled}} into sheets. An alloy of 96% zinc and 4% aluminium is used to make stamping dies for low production run applications for which ferrous metal dies would be too expensive. For building facades, roofing, and other applications for sheet metal formed by deep drawing, roll forming, or bending, zinc alloys with titanium and copper are used. Unalloyed zinc is too brittle for these manufacturing processes.|$|E
