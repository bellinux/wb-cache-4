Texas musician Doug Sahm wrote a song entitled [...] "Louis Riel," [...] which appeared on the album S.D.Q. '98.

500|$|Raoul Berger, in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, disagrees; {{the words}} of the statute were clear, and the only {{application}} that it could have was unjust. Statutory interpretation allows for the ignoring of unjust extraneous meanings, but what Coke did was nullify the statute as a whole, along with its main intention. John V. Orth, writing in the Constitutional Commentary, concurs: [...] "If that were so, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> not say so? Is it likely that the royal judges, confronting a case involving a statute that had necessarily passed both houses of parliament and received the royal assent, would lightly use the word 'void'?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Kershaw {{looks for}} answers to the {{question}} of why Germany did not capitulate when there was no chance of victory, especially as Hitler had said [...] "Wars are finally decided by the recognition on {{one side or the other}} that the war can't be won any more." [...] At the time he said this Germany was waging war on two fronts and was heavily outnumbered by both the allied forces and those of the Soviet Union. On the Eastern Front alone the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe were outnumbered eleven-to-one in infantry, seven-to-one in armour, twenty-to-one in field artillery and twenty-to-one in airpower. Or, as Kershaw writes, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> continue the fight when Germany had been [...] "battered into submission, its economy destroyed, its cities in ruins, the country occupied by foreign powers"? An estimated 49 percent of German military losses occurred during the last 10 months of the war in Europe, and Kershaw discusses that if the assassination attempt had not failed how many lives might have been spared in both civilian and military casualties.|$|E

40|$|Orthodox {{financial}} theory often {{ignores the}} role played by managers' personal characteristics in their decision-making processes. However, as anyone with experience in the business world knows, managers' personalities are crucial in the choices they make. Indeed, {{it should be noted that}} firms do not make decisions, rather it is the managers who decide - either as a group or individually. This book explores the impact of managers' psychological profiles and life experiences on their financial decisions, taking the following key questions as starting points: <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> commit mistakes? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> contract debt and issue shares? How <b>do</b> <b>they</b> choose the right amount of dividends to distribute? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> acquire other firms? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>they</b> sometimes choose to manipulate information and to commit fraud?As the book highlights, having insights into managers' psychology is essential to understanding their choices and predicting decisions made by competing firms...|$|R

She also claims {{that she was}} only used for two-thirds of her contracted appearances. She said: [...] "In the 18 months I was in EastEnders, I had no impact. There was nothing that made people sit up and take notice of what Josie was doing. It was like they remembered I was around and threw me a line where I would slide into the bar and say, 'Hello, how are you' and then sit on a stool and say nothing {{for the rest of the}} episode. I came to feel that I was letting the black community down because my character was so empty. People of my own colour often accosted me in public and accused me of playing a token black. I was so little-used that they even wrote me cheques for episodes I never appeared in. So <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> not use me? Why are they wasting the taxpayers' money? It was very dispiriting." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, Scruggs {{was getting}} bored with {{repetition}} of the classic bluegrass fare. [...] By now, his sons were professional musicians, and he was caught up in their enthusiasm for more contemporary music. He said, [...] "I love bluegrass music, and still like to play it, but I do like to mix in some other music for my own personal satisfaction, because if I don't, I can get a little bogged down and a little depressed". Scruggs also wanted to play concerts in venues that normally featured rock and roll acts. Columbia Records executives told Flatt and Scruggs that they intended to try a new producer, Bob Johnston, instead of their long-time producer Don Law. Johnston had produced Bob Dylan's records. This new association produced Changin' Times, Nashville Airplane, and The Story of Bonnie and Clyde albums. [...] Flatt was not happy with some of this material — he didn't like singing Bob Dylan songs and refused to perform them, saying [...] "I can't sing Bob Dylan stuff, I mean. Columbia has got Bob Dylan, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> want me?". Even the success of the Bonnie and Clyde album was not enough to prevent their breakup in 1969. After the split, Flatt formed a traditional bluegrass group with Curly Seckler and Marty Stuart called The Nashville Grass, and Scruggs formed the Earl Scruggs Revue with his sons.|$|E
2500|$|Taylor {{met with}} John Battle, then the Member of Parliament for Leeds West, in 1987 {{to present his}} findings, and Battle raised the matter in a House of Commons debate. Along with Leeds City Council, {{he called for a}} public inquiry into the deaths at Armley, but the {{incumbent}} Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher rejected the request, {{on the grounds that it}} [...] "would cause needless concern, that it was impossible to discover what had happened at Roberts, and that no one could then have imagined that the dust could have harmed residents." [...] Battle submitted to the House: [...] "I cannot believe that those who owned and ran Roberts can have gone in and out without seeing the dust everywhere on the surrounding streets and pavements. If they knew that their workers within had to be protected from the asbestos dust, how could they have ignored the position of their neighbours who lived with that dust outside? It was not rendered neutral or innocuous as it left their premises. If they knew, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> knowingly continue to ask not only their employees but local residents for a generation to pay the price with their lives for the profits of continued asbestos production? ...Should not the company be responsible for that deadly legacy? The Armley asbestos tragedy cannot remain private and hidden because it is not yet over." ...|$|E

2500|$|The news website AsiaNews quoted Yahia Said, an Iraqi {{scholar at}} the London School of Economics, as saying: [...] "The {{reception}} [...] was surprisingly low-key in Iraq. Part of the reason was that rumors and tall stories, as well as true stories, about abuse, mass rape, and torture in the jails and in coalition custody have been going round for a long time. So compared to what people {{have been talking about}} here the pictures are quite benign. There's nothing unexpected. In fact what most people are asking is: <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> come up now? People in Iraq are always suspecting that there's some scheming going on, some agenda in releasing the pictures at this particular point." [...] CNN reporter Ben Wedeman reported that Iraqi reaction to George W. Bush's apology for the Abu Ghraib abuses was [...] "mixed": [...] "Some people react positively, saying that he's come out, he's dealing frankly and openly with the problem and that he has said that those involved in the abuse will be punished. On the other hand, there are many others who says it simply isn't enough, that they – many people noted that there was not a frank apology from the president for this incident. And, in fact, I have a Baghdad newspaper with me right now from – it's called 'Dar-es-Salaam.' That's from the Islam Iraqi Islamic Party. It says that an apology is not enough for the torture [...] of Iraqi prisoners." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} when in [...] "Moses {{diligently}} inquired [...] for the goat of the sin-offering," [...] the language indicates that Moses made two inquiries: (1) If the priests had slaughtered the goat of the sin-offering, why {{had they not}} eaten it? And (2) If the priests {{were not going to}} eat it, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>they</b> slaughter it? And immediately thereafter, [...] reports that Moses [...] "was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar," [...] and Midrash taught that through becoming angry, he forgot the law. Rav Huna taught that this was one of three instances where Moses lost his temper and as a consequence forgot a law. (The other two instances were with regard to the Sabbath in [...] and with regard to the purification of unclean metal utensils [...] ) In this case (involving Nadab and Abihu), because of his anger, Moses forgot the law that those in the first stage of mourning (onen), prior to the burial of their dead, are prohibited from eating the meat of sacrifices. Aaron asked Moses whether he should eat consecrated food on the day that his sons died. Aaron argued that since the tithe (which is of lesser sanctity) is forbidden to be eaten by a bereaved person prior to the burial of his dead, how much more certainly must the meat of the sin-offering (which is more sacred) be prohibited to a bereaved person prior to the burial of his dead. Immediately after Moses heard Aaron's argument, he issued a proclamation to the Israelites, saying that he had made an error in regard to the law and Aaron his brother came and taught him. Eleazar and Ithamar had known the law, but kept their silence out of deference to Moses, and as a reward, God addressed them directly along with Moses and Aaron in [...] When [...] reports that [...] "the Lord spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them," [...] Rabbi Hiyya taught that the words [...] "to them" [...] referred to Eleazar and Ithamar.|$|E
