5|$|In late 2016, Zac Baird {{left the}} live band after 10 years, amidst {{conflicts}} between {{his wife and}} Munky's wife over Instagram.

It was later announced that Fieldy would be missing Korn's tour of South America and Robert Trujillo's (The Bassist of Metallica) son, Tye (who was 12 at the time) <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> perform with the band {{for the duration of}} the tour.|$|E

5|$|A {{powerful}} Senate Select Committee {{oversaw the}} NCDC and renowned British architect Sir William Holford <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> fine-tune Griffin's original plans. He changed the central basin's geometry {{so that it}} was no longer a segment of circle; he converted the southern straight edge into a polygonal shape with three edges and inserted a gulf on the northern shore. The result was closer to Scrivener's modified design some decades earlier.|$|E

5|$|After Michael France {{delivered}} the original screenplay, Jeffrey Caine <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> rewrite it. Caine kept many of France's ideas but added the prologue {{prior to the}} credits. Kevin Wade polished the script and Bruce Feirstein added the finishing touches. In the film, the writing credit was shared by Caine and Feirstein, while France was credited with only the story, an arrangement he felt was unfair, particularly as he believed the additions made were not an improvement on his original version. Wade did not receive an official credit, but was acknowledged in the naming of Jack Wade, the CIA character he created.|$|E

It was initially supposed, after an announcement in 2015, that Avalanche Studios was brought on board to help create the game's airship mechanics. In the event, Avalanche and Square Enix did not directly collaborate: instead, Avalanche showed them their level of detail development methods, and Square Enix's internal team created the airship mechanics using that information.|$|E

Unlike most roller coasters, the ride's second drop through Thunderbolt's structure is longer than its first drop.|$|E

McFarlane was the original penciller for issue #61, but his artwork had been rejected by Larry Hama as unacceptable, and so Marshall Rogers <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> pencil the final published version. In the years following, McFarlane became a superstar comic artist, and Marvel eventually decided to print the unpublished work.|$|E

Graham was asked to write an episode primarily for children which would soften the much darker finale that would be broadcast after. The episode was watched by 7.14 million viewers in the UK, and was given an Appreciation Index of 83. Though Graham received letters from children who enjoyed the episode, it did not generate a positive response from adult fans and critics.|$|E
5|$|The film's initial {{story was}} about Tony Leung's {{character}} being a psychopath who would poison baby food. When Terence Chang was making connections to have Woo make {{films in the}} United States, Chang found people uninterested and disgusted with the theme of babies being poisoned. This halted production for a month {{to develop a new}} story. Screenwriter Barry Wong <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> write a new story about Tony Leung's character being an undercover police officer. After writing {{the first part of the}} script, Wong went on a vacation outside Hong Kong, where he died leaving the script unfinished.|$|E
5|$|The war effort, debilitated by {{a rebellious}} {{confederation}} {{established by the}} unpaid military, was continued. Turkey, threatened by the Polish territorial gains became involved at the frontiers, and a peace between Russia and Sweden was agreed to in 1617.

The city would not open its gates and not enough military strength <b>was</b> <b>brought</b> <b>in</b> <b>to</b> attempt a forced take-over.|$|E
