2500|$|The band {{relocated}} to College Park, Maryland, to record its debut album from June to September 2005.

[...] "We were making things up in our heads that weren't there, and on top of the stress of trying to finish the record, we were living in a one-bedroom apartment with four people on bunk beds," [...] recalled Ross.

50|$|Misc or {{sometimes}} 'misk' is another gender title pronoun. The word {{is derived from}} the Latin word miscellus, meaning “mixed,” following the rationale that a lot of non-binary people <b>would</b> <b>say</b> that <b>they</b> have aspects of various genders at various times.|$|R

50|$|The song asked {{listeners}} {{to pay attention}} to what children <b>would</b> <b>say</b> as <b>they</b> played. It touched on, among other things, verbal spousal abuse, tax evasion and racism, and at the end, laid blame for what the children said directly at the feet of their parents.|$|R

60|$|Whoever {{located the}} ecclesiastical {{buildings}} of England and Scotland certainly had an exquisite perception of natural scenery; for one notices {{that they are}} almost invariably placed on just that point of the landscape, where the poet or the artist <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>they</b> should be.
