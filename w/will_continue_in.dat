5|$|However, despite Ohio's large {{presence}} in the iron and steel market, employment rates have declined in Ohio, generally attributed to weakening national economy. Between 1998 and 2005, the number of Ohio {{iron and steel industry}} workers decreased from 52,700 to 34,000. The Ohio Department of Development predicts the decreases <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> coming years. The average annual salary for iron and steel industry workers in Ohio was $59,686, compared the national industry average of $53,352.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the continents}} of North and South America are moving westward from Africa and Europe. Researchers have {{produced}} several scenarios {{about how this}} <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> the future. These geodynamic models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic ocean becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, Pacific ocean remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia.|$|E

5|$|Bahá'u'lláh's teachings {{focus on}} the unity of God, religion, and mankind. Similar to other monotheistic religions, God is {{considered}} {{the source of all}} created things. Religion, according to Bahá'u'lláh, is renewed periodically by Manifestations of God, people who are made perfect through divine intervention and whose teachings are the sources of the major world religions throughout history. Bahá'ís view Bahá'u'lláh as the first of these teachers whose mission includes the spiritual unification of the entire planet through the eradication of racism and nationalism. Bahá'u'lláh's teachings include the need for a world tribunal to adjudicate disputes between nations, a uniform system of weights and measures, and an auxiliary language that could be spoken by all the people on earth. Bahá'u'lláh also taught that the cycles of revelatory renewal <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> the future, with Manifestations of God appearing every thousand years or so.|$|E

At the wedding ceremony, Picard escorts Kamala {{down the aisle and}} watches as she marries another. After the newlyweds have returned to the planet, Picard says goodbye to Briam in the transporter room.

25|$|In about 5 to 6 billion years, the Sun {{will have}} {{depleted}} the hydrogen fuel in its core and {{will begin to}} expand. At its largest, its surface (photosphere) will approximately reach the current orbit of Earth. It will then lose its atmosphere completely; its outer layers forming a planetary nebula and the core a white dwarf. The evolution of the Sun into and through the red-giant phase has been extensively modelled, but it remains unclear whether Earth will be engulfed by the Sun or <b>will</b> <b>continue</b> <b>in</b> orbit. The uncertainty arises in part because as the Sun burns hydrogen, it loses mass causing Earth (and all planets) to orbit farther away. There are also significant uncertainties in calculating the orbits of the planets over the next 5–6.5 billion years, so the fate of Earth is not well understood. At its brightest, the red-giant Sun will be several thousand times more luminous than today but its surface will be at about half the temperature.|$|E
