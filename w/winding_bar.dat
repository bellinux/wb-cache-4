50|$|Connected to and {{extending}} {{from the front of}} the main bombsight housing is the drift bar, normally forming over ½ of the overall length of the device. The drift bar is pivoted at its base, just in front of the compass area, allowing it to rotate to the left or right. On top of the <b>wind</b> <b>bar,</b> connecting the <b>wind</b> <b>bar</b> to the drift bar, is the ground speed slider. A pin passing vertically through the <b>wind</b> <b>bar's</b> internal slider to slotted plates in the drift bar and ground speed slider translate the motion of the <b>wind</b> <b>bar</b> into components along and across the axis of the drift bar. Motion across the axis pushes the entire <b>wind</b> <b>bar</b> to the left or right, indicating the proper heading to fly to cancel out the wind drift. Motion along the axis pushes the ground speed slider fore or aft, accounting for the difference between air and ground speed. The ground speed slider also carries the pin-shaped foresights, so as they move they adjust the sighting angle in order to drop the bombs early or late to account for the ground speed.|$|R
50|$|On early models, {{rotating}} {{the compass}} face also rotated a shaft that ran forward under {{the main body}} of the bombsight and through a metal tube running out the lower front of the main housing. On later models, a large knob known as the milled head was placed directly behind the compass and drove this shaft independently of the compass face, allowing calculations to be carried out without changing the bombsight settings. The rotating shaft ran to the <b>wind</b> <b>bar</b> located in front of the body of the gunsight. The rotation of this bar to the selected angle mechanically represented the wind vector relative to the aircraft. At the end of the <b>wind</b> <b>bar</b> is the <b>wind</b> screw knob, which is used to set the wind speed. As the knob is rotated, a plate inside the <b>wind</b> <b>bar</b> moves fore and aft along the direction of the bar.|$|R
50|$|On the CSBS each {{of these}} arrows has a {{mechanical}} equivalent in the bombsight. The direction of the yellow arrow {{is that of the}} aircraft itself, represented in the bombsight by its mounting to the aircraft fuselage. The length of the yellow arrow is set by rotating the air speed drum, carrying the windage calculator with it. The milled head is used to rotate the <b>wind</b> <b>bar</b> to the same angle as the wind, in this case about 120 degrees. This would leave the <b>wind</b> <b>bar</b> almost at right angles to the drift <b>bar,</b> with the <b>wind</b> speed knob easily accessible on the left. Finally the wind speed would be dialled into the wind speed knob, which would push the entire drift bar assembly to the right. When all of the adjustments are complete, the bombsight and airspeed shaft mechanically represent the yellow arrow, the <b>wind</b> <b>bar</b> represents the blue arrow, and the green arrow is formed by the drift wires providing direction, and the foresights are positioned {{at the tip of the}} arrow.|$|R

50|$|The {{motion of}} the <b>wind</b> <b>bar</b> and <b>wind</b> screw knob {{accounts}} {{for two of the}} three vectors involved in the windage calculation. The last is the airspeed of the bomber - its absolute direction can be ignored if everything is measured in terms of the direction to the target, {{as in the case of}} the CSBS. The length of this vector is set by the air speed drum, found on the right side of the main case (or at the back of the device on earlier versions). Turning the air speed knob that pushes the tube carrying the wind direction shaft fore or aft. A housing at the end of this tube carries the <b>wind</b> <b>bar,</b> so rotating the airspeed drum moves the entire wind speed calculation fore and aft to account for increasing or decreasing airspeed.|$|R

The cursor slid along the <b>wind</b> <b>bar,</b> allowing the bomb aimer to measure different airspeeds or times. A small scale on the cursor allowed for the conversion of indicated air speed to true air speed, which differs depending on altitude. A small ring on the right side of the cursor was used to accurately place markings on the compass using the grease pencil. A holder for the pencil and a sharpener blade were attached on the left side of the case.|$|R

Attacking a moving target {{is similar to the}} basic concept for correcting for wind, although, unlike wind, the target's movement may be significant even after the bomb is dropped. The CSBS accounted for this through the use of the enemy vector mechanism or fourth vector, which was similar to the wind mechanism but operated at the origin of the drift bar instead of a point located along it. Setting the enemy speed screw or enemy direction knob moved a mechanism similar to the <b>wind</b> <b>bar,</b> but the movement along the track moved the entire height bar fore or aft.|$|R

When both the high-rise building absent on the windward side of the platforms and the trains were absent, air temperature of platforms was 0. 5 K lower and wind velocity ratio was 3 to 5 times higher than that observed when the highrise building was present.

40|$|Abstract—The paper aims to {{investigate}} {{the use of the}} Finite Element Method for electrical and mechanical faults detection in three-phase squirrel cage, induction machines. The features of Finite Element Method are significant, which consider the physical mapping of stator <b>winding</b> and rotor <b>bar</b> distribution. Therefore, modeling of the faults in stator <b>winding,</b> rotor <b>bars</b> and air-gap eccentricity will be predicated in more accurate way. In comparison with conventional methods such as coupling method, the Finite Element Method considers the complex machine geometry, material type of the bar, current and the flux distributions within the electrical machines. As a result, the air-gap eccentricity and the broken bars can be modeled effectively using this approach. Motor current signature analysis has been used to give a decision about the fault occurrence. For the broken rotor bar, frequency of the sideband components around the fundamental is used to indicate the presence of fault. However, the sideband frequencies cannot be used to recognize the stator winding short circuit and eccentricities faults, where the harmonics have approximately the same frequency over the spectrum. The amplitude of the sideband harmonic components have been used to differentiate between them. It has been found that the inter-turn short circuit faults have a sideband harmonic component with amplitude greater than {{that in the case of}} the air-gap eccentricity faults. Also current paper introduces the detection of broken rotor bars based on stator current envelope technique...|$|R
50|$|The third {{method of}} {{determining}} the wind is {{used in conjunction with}} the <b>wind</b> gauge <b>bar.</b> The aircraft is flown on three different headings, typically 120 degrees apart, and the time for the aircraft to travel a certain distance was measured with the timing beads. The bearing plate was rotated to match the compass heading of each leg, and the cursor was moved along the bar to draw a line on the bearing plate along that direction. After three such measurements a small triangle was formed. The aircraft then turned onto the bomb line. Using the drift angle measured from the auxiliary drift bar, the compass was rotated to that drift angle, and the cursor moved so it lay above the center of the triangle. This indicated the direction and speed of the wind.|$|R
