Speaking in 1995, he said, [...] "When it came to recording 'Pride' for The Unforgettable Fire album, Danny [...] was able to pick up from me that I had some interesting ideas but here was a slight lack of focus. My kick drum technique was then, as it is now, completely underdeveloped and I {{never got a chance to}} practice and learn like most people would. In the marching bands, I only used a snare and when I first got a kit, I never learned how to properly use all the elements together. So I went and listened to a basic demo of 'Pride' and tried to play a beat just using the kick and snare. But I couldn't get the kick to do what I wanted, so I got a floor tom down and did what I'd done in the past, which was if I couldn't physically do what was necessary, I'd find another <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>it.</b> I couldn't do what most people would consider a normal beat for the song, so I chose alternatives." ...|$|E

2500|$|In late 19th century Danish {{linguist}} Vilhelm Thomsen in {{the speech}} of a Livonian sailor identified a characteristic that to him seemed {{very similar to the}} Danish stød, this feature was later the subject of research by several Finno-Ugricists. Although the (Indo-European) Latvian and (Uralic) Livonian are phylogenetically unrelated (being from different language families) both have influenced each other heavily in terms of phonology. Whether Livonian acquired this feature from Latvian or vice versa is debated, however, owing to the fact that Livonian is the only Finno-Ugric language to have this feature, the majority of researchers believe it has been a product of Latvian influence on Livonian and not the other <b>way</b> <b>around.</b> <b>It</b> is possible that [...] "Livonian stød" [...] would be classified as a pitch accent only by Latvian classification just like the identical Latvian lauztā intonācija, otherwise it would be considered a pitch register, glottalization or similar categories as discussed above.|$|E
2500|$|All {{reptiles}} breathe using lungs. Aquatic turtles {{have developed}} more permeable skin, and some species have modified their cloaca {{to increase the}} area for gas exchange. Even with these adaptations, breathing is never fully accomplished without lungs. Lung ventilation is accomplished differently in each main reptile group. In squamates, the lungs are ventilated almost exclusively by the axial musculature. This is also the same musculature that is used during locomotion. Because of this constraint, most squamates are forced to hold their breath during intense runs. Some, however, have found a <b>way</b> <b>around</b> <b>it.</b> Varanids, {{and a few other}} lizard species, employ buccal pumping as a complement to their normal [...] "axial breathing". This allows the animals to completely fill their lungs during intense locomotion, and thus remain aerobically active for a long time. Tegu lizards are known to possess a proto-diaphragm, which separates the pulmonary cavity from the visceral cavity. While not actually capable of movement, it does allow for greater lung inflation, by taking the weight of the viscera off the lungs.|$|E
