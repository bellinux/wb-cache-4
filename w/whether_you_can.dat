500|$|Historically, the actuarial {{profession}} {{has been reluctant}} to specify the pass marks for its examinations ( [...] , [...] ). To address concerns that there are pre-existing pass/fail quotas, a former Chairman of the Board of Examiners of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries stated, [...] "Although students find it hard to believe, the Board of Examiners does not have fail quotas to achieve. Accordingly pass rates are free to vary (and do). They are determined by the quality of the candidates sitting the examination and in particular how well prepared they are. Fitness to pass is the criterion, not <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> achieve a mark in the top 40% of candidates sitting." [...] In 2000, the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS) decided to start releasing pass marks for the exams it offers [...] The CAS's policy is also not to grade to specific pass ratios; the CAS board affirmed in 2001 that [...] "the CAS shall use no predetermined pass ratio as a guideline for setting the pass mark for any examination. If the CAS determines that 70% of all candidates have demonstrated sufficient grasp of the syllabus material, then those 70% should pass. Similarly, if the CAS determines that only 30% of all candidates have demonstrated sufficient grasp of the syllabus material, then only those 30% should pass.".|$|E

2500|$|As {{opposition}} leader, Livni {{noted in}} a 2009 Knesset speech that she herself did not support Yitzhak Rabin's policies at the time. [...] "The dispute is around the question of <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> have it both ways—maintaining Israel as a Jewish state and keeping the entire Land of Israel," [...] she said. Political analysts see Livni's speech at the 2003 commemoration rally for Rabin as {{a turning point in}} her political career when she became more popular among the Israeli peace camp. She delivered a speech which many found deeply moving in which she said the day Rabin was murdered was [...] "the day that the skies fell down on me because of what happened to us, to all the citizens of Israel." [...] As foreign minister, Livni would again attend the memorial for Rabin in 2009. Labor Party officials were not keen on this idea, fearing that her appearance would cost them votes. Some Kadima officials also seemed reluctant, fearing her appearance at left-wing event would send some votes Likud's way. Livni attended the memorial for Rabin in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|Stuart now {{sought to}} take a useful role in the {{campaign}} and perhaps, according to some historians, to redeem his reputation and to secure the glory of another ride around the Union Army. On June 22, Lee gave Stuart discretionary orders for his movement to Pennsylvania with the important point being: [...] "If you find that he [...] is moving northward, and that two brigades can guard the Blue Ridge {{and take care of}} your rear, you can move with the other three into Maryland, and take position on General Ewell's right." [...] Lee wrote to Stuart again on June 23 in an apparent effort to clarify his orders as follows: [...] "You will, however, be able to judge <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> pass around their Army without hindrance, doing them all the damage you can, and cross the river east of the mountains. In either case, after crossing the river, you must move on and feel the right of Ewell's troops." [...] Lee's orders did not give Stuart a specific route to follow. Confederate Colonel Edward Porter Alexander, chief of artillery of Longstreet's corps, stated [...] "Stuart made to Lee a very unwise proposition, which Lee more unwisely entertained." ...|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{after her}} {{election}} to Parliament, Hanson's book, Pauline Hanson – the truth : on Asian immigration, the Aboriginal question, the gun debate {{and the future}} of Australia, was published. In it she makes claims of Aboriginal cannibalism, in particular that Aboriginal women ate their babies and tribes cannibalised their members. Hanson told the media that the reason for these claims of cannibalism was to [...] "demonstrate the savagery of Aboriginal society". David Ettridge, the One Nation party director, said that the book's claims were intended to correct [...] "misconceptions" [...] about Aboriginal history. These alleged misconceptions were said to be relevant to modern-day Aboriginal welfare funding. He asserted that [...] "the suggestion that we should be feeling some concern for modern day Aborigines for suffering in the past is balanced a bit by the alternative view of <b>whether</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> feel sympathy for people who eat their babies". The book predicted that in 2050 Australia would have a lesbian president of Chinese-Indian background called Poona Li Hung who would be a cyborg. In 2004, Hanson said that the book was [...] "written by some other people who actually put my name to it" [...] and that while she held the copyright over The Truth, she was unaware that much of the material was being published under her name.|$|E

I waited, and I waited, and I waited…and I got what I should have expected the entire time: love, support, and admiration."
