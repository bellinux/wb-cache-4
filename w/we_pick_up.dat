[...] Unlike the 2014 crossover, which was two separate self-contained adventures that involved each show, Marc Guggenheim, executive producer on Arrow, said: [...] "This [...] is a crazy, full-on 'To Be Continued' crossover,... it really feels like a 2-hour movie [...] over two nights." [...] Kreisberg and Guggenheim also reassured fans that both episodes would not focus solely on setting up the spin-off series, and that the crossover is still Oliver Queen and Barry Allen having their own adventure. [...] "These [...] have important stuff going on for the narratives of both The Flash and Arrow," [...] said Kriesberg, while Guggenheim added: [...] "The final moments of The Flash have a pretty big jaw-dropper and <b>we</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> those threads in Arrow. Then we do some things with the characters from Arrow... that are pretty epic and major." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, {{talking about}} whether {{the ending of the}} season would also be a {{satisfying}} end to the series, Bell said [...] "we're not thinking of it as a series finale as much as a season finale ... I think we have some momentum coming in [...] and I think <b>we</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> on it. I'm optimistic that we can keep the plane in the air a little longer." [...] He also talked {{about whether the}} themes of family and connectedness from the first season would be re-explored in the second, saying [...] "What we always look for are the human elements in the big story. That's what television does well, it makes you care about people, and whether it's literal family or anytime you have a team of people working together, it takes on some sort of family metaphor." [...] Bell reiterated the idea of family following the end of the season, saying [...] "In many ways, the whole metaphor {{at the heart of the}} show is family—you've got Coulson and May and then a bunch of younger people, and it allows us to play out different dynamics; literally, this season, we had Skye's biological parents versus her surrogate parents. And at the same time, we had Skye growing up. We had her going from a slightly sulky hacker season one to training to become an agent to becoming our first full-fledged superhero and so as we grow up, we separate from our parents... In our minds, her mom wasn't a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position." [...] Discussing the reveal that Skye is actually Daisy Johnson, Maurissa Tancharoen explained thatJohnson is a character that we always liked. We always knew there was a potential to evolve Skye into something else. It took a little bit of time, but we were happy when we were able to land on Daisy Johnson, and actually have that work in our mythology. But as with everything that we do on the show, we pull from the properties, and we do our own spin to it. So we are kind of merging a few concepts and storylines. We've spent a season and a half with Skye. We've seen her evolve as a person, we've grown to like her as a person, we've seen her evolve as an agent. And now, finally bringing her to her origin story—I think there's just a lot more emotional weight to it, because you already know her as just Skye, and now she will have this ability that she may not understand, that she may not want ... We're going to focus on Skye, and how that affects the people around her, and how the relationships may shift. Because we've seen through the course of our series so far; we've spoken about how S.H.I.E.L.D. treats gifteds or views them, and they're categorized, things like that. What does that mean when one of your own is now considered someone with an ability? How do you categorize her?Whedon elaborated that [...] "We're going to walk her through the steps of discovering what this really means, and coming to terms with it. All that stuff is really interesting to us, and in television, because we have time to explore, we can take her origin on all sorts of different paths." [...] Additionally, Whedon talked about how the character would be referred to on the show after the reveal, saying, [...] "She's still Skye, because she thinks she's Skye. I think her dad thinks she's Daisy, and we'll see if she ever gets to the point where she believes that that's something that she would want to call herself. But right now, she has her own identity." ...|$|E

I know many ghosts who talk familiarly of 'awfully jolly hops,' and allude to their progenitors as 'the governor.' Indeed, it is considered quite behind the times to describe a lady as 'vastly pretty,' and poor Mr. Pepys, who still preserves the antiquated idiom of his diary, is looked upon among us as a dreadfully slow old fogey." ...|$|E
60|$|I had no {{share in}} the {{business}} of Donauwerth, being now among the horse, but I was posted on the roads with five troops of horse, where <b>we</b> <b>picked</b> <b>up</b> a great many stragglers of the garrison, whom we made prisoners of war.|$|R

60|$|I was by {{no means}} the only reader of books on board the Neversink. Several other sailors were diligent readers, though their studies did not lie in the way of belles-lettres. Their {{favourite}} authors were such as you may find at the book-stalls around Fulton Market; they were slightly physiological in their nature. My book experiences on board of the frigate proved an example of a fact which every book-lover must have experienced before me, namely, that though public libraries have an imposing air, and doubtless contain invaluable volumes, yet, somehow, the books that prove most agreeable, grateful, and companionable, are those <b>we</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> by chance here and there; those which seem put into our hands by Providence; those which pretend to little, but abound in much.|$|E
6000|$|... "Your pardon, Lady Blakeney," [...] he said, [...] "but I must {{confer with}} the {{prisoner}} now, and take from him full directions for the continuance of our journey. After that I {{go to the}} guard-house, which is some distance from here, right {{at the other end}} of the city. <b>We</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> a fresh squad here, twenty hardened troopers from a cavalry regiment usually stationed at Abbeville. They have had work to do in this town, which is a hot-bed of treachery. I must go inspect the men and the sergeant who will be in command. Citizen Heron leaves all these inspections to me; he likes to stay by his prisoner. In the meanwhile you will be escorted back to your coach, where I pray you to await my arrival, when we change guard first, then proceed on our way." ...|$|E
60|$|My own {{position}} {{in this matter}} of 'physical phenomena' is, I hope, clear. They interest me, for my present purpose, as being, whatever their real nature and origin, things which would suggest to a savage his theory of Fetishism. 'An inanimate object may be tenanted by a spirit, as is proved by its extraordinary movements.' Thus the early thinker might reason, {{and go on to}} revere the object. It is to be wished that competent observers would pay more attention to such savage practices as crystal-gazing and automatism as illustrated by the sticks of the Melanesians, Zulus, and Yaos. Our scanty information <b>we</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> out of stray allusions, but it has the advantage of being uncontaminated by theory, the European spectator not knowing the wide range of such practices and their value in experimental psychology.|$|E

6000|$|Twelve o'clock, {{the hour}} at {{which most of}} the offices closed on Saturday in summer, was excitedly approaching. The office-women {{throughout}} the Septimus Building, who had been showing off their holiday frocks all morning, were hastily finishing letters, or rushing to the women's wash-rooms to discuss with one another the hang of new skirts. All morning Bessie Kraker had kept up a monologue, beginning, [...] "Say, lis-ten, Miss Golden, say, gee!

6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> a {{stone and}} then let it go, why does it {{fall to the ground}} ?" [...] The usual answer to this {{question}} is: [...] "Because it is attracted by the earth." [...] Modern physics formulates the answer rather differently for the following reason. As a result of the more careful study of electromagnetic phenomena, we have come to regard action at a distance as a process impossible without the intervention of some intermediary medium. If, for instance, a magnet attracts a piece of iron, we cannot be content to regard this as meaning that the magnet acts directly on the iron through the intermediate empty space, but we are constrained to imagine -- after the manner of Faraday -- that the magnet always calls into being something physically real in the space around it, that something being what we call a [...] "magnetic field." [...] In its turn this magnetic field operates on the piece of iron, so that the latter strives to move towards the magnet. We shall not discuss here the justification for this incidental conception, which is indeed a somewhat arbitrary one. We shall only mention that with its aid electromagnetic phenomena can be theoretically represented much more satisfactorily than without it, and this applies particularly to the transmission of electromagnetic waves. The effects of gravitation also are regarded in an analogous manner.|$|E
6000|$|We emphatically {{deny that}} we have ever made any unprovoked attacks upon them. [...] "God's elect" [...] are always irritating us. They are {{eternally}} lying in wait with some monstrous absurdity, to spring it upon us {{at the very moment}} when we are least prepared. They take a fiendish delight in torturing us with tantrums, galling us with gammon, and pelting us with platitudes. Whenever we disguise ourself in the seemly toggery of the godly, and enter meekly into the tabernacle, hoping to pass unobserved, the parson is sure to detect us and explode a bombful of bosh upon our devoted head. No sooner do <b>we</b> <b>pick</b> <b>up</b> a religious weekly than we stumble and sprawl through a bewildering succession of inanities, manufactured expressly to ensnare our simple feet. If we take up a tract we are laid out cold by an apostolic knock straight from the clerical shoulder. We cannot walk out of a pleasant Sunday without being keeled Over by a stroke of pious lightning flashed from the tempestuous eye of an irate churchman at our secular attire. Should we cast our thoughtless glance upon the demure Methodist Rachel we are paralysed by a scowl of disapprobation, which prostrates like the shock of a gymnotus; and any of our mild pleasantry at the expense of young Squaretoes is cut short by a Bible rebuke, shot out of his mouth like a rock from a catapult.|$|E
