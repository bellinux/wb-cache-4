25|$|Predictions {{that the}} batting would prove {{superior}} to the bowling and that the first Test might well be left unfinished were certainly justified; and yet there were three times when {{one side or the}} other might have gained a <b>winning</b> <b>advantage...</b> there was some very brilliant batting, some splendid bowling, and much good fielding and throwing. On the other hand there was rather too much indifferent batting, a surfeit of defensive bowling and tactics, and some deplorable fielding in which the simplest of chances were missed.|$|E
500|$|Originally, the top {{finisher}} in {{the league}} {{at the end of}} the season was supposed to receive home-field advantage throughout the Final Stage, but in August 2003, PL officials announced that if the first-place team led the second-place team by more than five games {{at the end of the}} regular season, that team would also receive a one-game <b>winning</b> <b>advantage</b> in the Final Stage's best-of-five series. For the 2006 season, PL officials removed the five-game lead requirement in favor of automatically awarding the first-place team the one-win advantage. In conjunction with this change, the first-place team [...] no longer had home-field advantage for the entirety of the Final Stage; instead, the remaining four games were to be split evenly between both teams' stadiums. This rule change became a non-factor after the eventual first-place Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters clinched a Japan Series berth in two straight games.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we look at}} {{motivation}} over time by setting up a dynamic contest model where winning the first contest yields an advantage in the second contest. The <b>win</b> <b>advantage</b> introduces an asymmetry into the competition that we find reduces the expected value to the contestants {{of being in the}} game, whilst it increases the efforts exerted. Hence it may seem that a <b>win</b> <b>advantage</b> is advantageous for an effort maximizing contest designer, whereas in expectation it will not be beneficial for the players. We also show that the principal should distribute a majority of the total prize mass to the second contest. With ex ante asymmetry, the effect of the <b>win</b> <b>advantage</b> on the effort in the second contest depends on how disadvantaged the laggard is. A large disadvantage at the outset implies that as the <b>win</b> <b>advantage</b> increases, total effort for the disadvantaged firm is reduced as the discouragement effect dominates the catching-up effect. If the inital disadvantage is not significant, then the catching-up effect dominates and the laggard increases its total effort...|$|R

40|$|Home {{advantage}} {{was evaluated}} {{using data from}} three national netball competitions: The Commonwealth Bank Trophy which ran from 1997 to 2007 in Australia, The National Bank Cup which ran from 1998 to 2007 in New Zealand, and The Co-operative Netball Superleague which ran from 2005 / 06 to 2008 / 09 in England. Mixed models were {{used to analyze the}} goal advantage in playing at home, and both resampling methods and mixed models were used to analyze the probability of winning at home. In Australia there was a significant overall goal advantage in playing at home of 1. 9 goals, 95 % CI (1. 0, 2. 7). This value is small compared to the average score for a home team of 53 goals per game. Only in 1997 and 2006 were significant goal advantages evident, both of value 3. 3 goals, 95 % CI's (0. 5, 6. 1) and (0. 6, 6. 0) respectively. In the Australian competition, across all years, there was a significantly higher probability of winning at home, p = 0. 54, 95 % CI (0. 51, 0. 56).
