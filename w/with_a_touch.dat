5|$|After the March 1976 coup, Berni {{moved to}} New York City, where he {{continued}} painting, engraving, collaging and exhibiting. New York {{struck him as}} luxurious, consumerist, materially wealthy and spiritually poor. He conveyed these observations in subsequent work <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> of social irony. His New York paintings display a great protagonism of color and include Aeropuerto (Airport), Los Hippies, Calles de Nueva York (Streets of New York), Almuerzo (Lunch), Chelsea Hotel and Promesa de castidad (Promise of Chastity). He also produced several decorative panels, scenographic sketches, illustrations, and collaborations for books.|$|E
5|$|First {{displayed}} in June 2012 at Computex, the Zenbook Touch series has touch screens {{to take advantage}} of the Windows 8 operating system. The Zenbook Touch series includes the UX31A which is the same as the Zenbook Prime, but <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> enabled screen, and the U500VZ, a 15inch model. A UX21A <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> enabled screen was also demonstrated at Computex in June and officially announced in late August, though at the launch event on October23, 2012, only the UX31A and the U500VZ were displayed. The U500VZ is thicker than previous Zenbooks at 20mm (0.79") and uses a standard Ivy Bridge mobile processor rather than the ultra-low voltage CPUs used in other Zenbooks, thus technically pushing it out of the ultrabook category, although it still meets other ultrabook specifications. AnandTech reviewer Jason Inofuentes found the touch screen to be so superior to the trackpad that he stopped using the trackpad altogether in his trial of a Zenbook Touch at the Asus launch event. Chris Griffith of The Australian found that the screen of the UX31A responded well and that the Windows 8 gestures worked predictably, his only criticism being the high price.|$|E
5|$|In 2007/08 Omega FM was {{established}} in West London and became actively involved in political discussions. By late 2010 {{it was clear that}} Omega FM was {{following in the footsteps of}} pioneering black political pirate stations such as Galaxy FM and Genesis FM, adopting a similar format playing information documentaries concerning black history and Pan Afrikan ideologies along with Nation of Islam and The Nuwaubian ideologies as well as alternative approaches on current affairs, while also playing mostly Reggae music <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> of other genres of black music that is often politically orientated.|$|E

5|$|On {{one side}} of the road is a barber surgeon whose sign advertises Shaving, bleeding, and teeth drawn <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch.</b> Ecce signum! Inside the shop, the barber, who may be drunk, haphazardly shaves a customer, holding his nose like that of a pig, while spots of blood darken the cloth under his chin. The {{surgeons}} and barbers had been a single profession since 1540 and would not finally separate until 1745, when the surgeons broke away to form the Company of Surgeons. Bowls on the windowsill contain blood from the day's patients.|$|E
5|$|Beneath a Steel Sky is a 2D {{adventure}} {{game played}} from a third-person perspective. The player uses a point-and-click interface {{to interact with}} the environment and to guide protagonist Robert Foster through the game's world. To solve puzzles and progress in the game, the player collects items that may be combined with one another, used on the environment, or given to non-player characters (NPCs). The protagonist converses with NPCs via dialogue trees to learn about the game's puzzles and plot. Clues and other information are obtained by clicking on items in the inventory and on objects in the environment. Unlike in most adventure games at the time, the protagonist's death is possible, after which the player starts from the last save point. In the remastered iOS version, the point-and-click interface is replaced <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> user interface, a hint system is added, and hotspots are highlighted.|$|E
5|$|MAGIC, JAL's {{in-flight}} entertainment system, {{supported by}} the JAL Entertainment Network (now renamed as JAL Mooove!), features the latest hit movies and videos, games and audio programs. There are six generations of the MAGIC system: MAGIC-I, MAGIC-II, MAGIC-III, MAGIC-IV, MAGIC-V and the new MAGIC-VI". Introduced on 1 December 2007, the MAGIC-III system provides Audio/Video On Demand (AVOD) entertainment to all passengers. The number of movie, music, video and game channels on MAGIC-III was doubled from 57 to 130 by 2008; and it is installed on all seats on Boeing 767-300ER, 777-200ER and 777-300ER aircraft. Aircraft with MAGIC-I and MAGIC-II have movies that automatically start when the AVOD system is turned on—once the aircraft reaches cruise level—and economy class passengers can tune in to watch the movie in progress; and all movies restart upon completion. Executive and First Class passengers have full AVOD control. MAGIC systems also have JAL's duty-free shopping catalogue, including flight crew recommendations and a video of specials available on the flight. MAGIC-V will feature mostly the same entertainment as MAGIC-III, but <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>touch</b> screen controller, along with a handset. There will be USB ports for iPod connectivity, and an easier to control handset. (introduced on selected Boeing 767-300ER routes).|$|E

5|$|Most famous {{among the}} many temples built by the Wodeyars is the Chamundeshwari Temple atop the Chamundi Hill. The {{earliest}} structure here was consecrated in the 12th century and was later patronised by the Mysore rulers. Maharaja Krishnaraja III added a Dravidian-style gopuram in 1827. The temple has silver-plated doors with images of deities. Other images include those of the Hindu god Ganesha and of Maharaja Krishnaraja III with his three queens. Surrounding the main palace in Mysore and inside the fort are a group of temples, built in various periods.
