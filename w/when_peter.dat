25|$|The German {{government}} of Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, fearing {{the effect on}} relations with the British, was originally opposed to these plans, and had refused any funding <b>when</b> <b>Peters</b> began. Bismarck refused a second time <b>when</b> <b>Peters</b> returned to Germany during {{the last days of}} the Berlin Conference of 1884, demanding an imperial charter. Peters, however, threatened the Chancellor successfully by threatening to sell his acquisitions to King Léopold II of Belgium who was eager to expand his territory of Congo. As Bismarck's National Liberal Party allies in the Reichstag parliament were pro-colonial anyway, he finally agreed and the charter was granted. This constituted the necessary beginning for further expansion on the East African mainland during the years ensuing. During 1888 Peters achieved an agreement with Sultan Khalifah bin Said of Zanzibar who leased his coastal dominions in what was to be Tanganyika to the German East Africa Company.|$|R

5|$|After this success, which {{secured the}} Balkans, Maurice {{intended}} to consolidate Roman control {{by bringing in}} Armenian settlers who would be given land in exchange for military service. To this end, Priscus was sent to Armenia to recruit men and their families. His mission there, however, {{was interrupted by a}} large-scale military revolt that brought about the downfall of Maurice. In 602, Maurice again ordered his troops on the Danube frontier to winter north of the river. Again, this provoked widespread discontent, and <b>when</b> <b>Peter,</b> who had replaced Priscus, refused to bow down and rescind the order, an outright mutiny broke out. The army chose the officer Phocas as its new leader and marched down to Constantinople. Without any credible military forces of his own, Maurice had to flee, but was captured with his family and executed by Phocas, who now became emperor.|$|E
5|$|Another man {{is found}} dead by a self-inflicted bullet wound, though Dana was seen leaving his {{apartment}}. Evidence {{in his apartment}} points {{to the construction of}} a bomb, and the Fringe team suspects that Dana knows its location and may be hoping to exploit an event which will kill several people simultaneously in order to increase her own chances of death. Peter calls her, using caller ID spoofing to disguise his number as that of her late husband, and the signal allows authorities to pinpoint her location to a commuter train. The train is stopped and searched, while Dana leaves on her own with the bomb, moving it far enough away from the train. The bomb soon explodes, and <b>when</b> <b>Peter</b> and Lincoln search, they find Dana's body nearby, finally dead, and the only fatality from the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Antiquarian curiosity in {{the castle}} had begun as early as 1700, <b>when</b> <b>Peter</b> Le Neve visited and {{recorded}} some of the architectural details, but interest increased in the 19th century. This was partially due {{to the work of}} the local curate, the Reverend J. Jackson, who undertook the first archaeological excavations at the site during the 1840s, uncovering many of the foundations of the inner court. 17th and 18th century stained glass windows from the continent were installed in the chapel, where the 15th century wall paintings were rediscovered in 1844. The then owner, Colonel John Houlton, turned the chapel into a museum of curiosities, where for a small fee visitors could see sets of armour, what was said to be a pair of Oliver Cromwell's boots and other English Civil War artefacts, including letters from Cromwell written to the Hungerfords.|$|E

5000|$|A denial came <b>when</b> <b>Peter's</b> Galilean {{accent was}} taken as proof that he was indeed a disciple of Jesus. According to Matthew, Mark and Luke, [...] "the rooster crowed". Matthew adds {{that it was his}} accent that gave him away as coming from Galilee. Luke {{deviates}} slightly from this by stating that, rather than a crowd accusing Simon Peter, it was a third individual. John does not mention the Galilean accent.|$|R
5000|$|Peters {{was born}} in Freshwater, Isle of Wight, the son of Matthew Peters (born at Belfast, 1711), a civil {{engineer}} {{and member of the}} Royal Dublin Society; by Elizabeth, the eldest daughter of George Younge of Dublin.
