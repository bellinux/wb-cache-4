5|$|The versus mode {{is a free}} {{fighting}} mode where multiple {{players can}} box. The number of players can range from 0–2; both fighters can be controlled by either the computer or by a player. Initially {{there are only two}} playable characters; additional characters become accessible by playing through the story mode. Although the characters are grouped by their boxing <b>weight</b> <b>class,</b> any character can be selected to fight another regardless of <b>weight</b> <b>class.</b> Players can choose from ten locations for the bout. Initially, the only available arena is the Kamogawa Boxing Gym basement. New locations become available once a fight occurs there in the story mode.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 198 events in 23 {{different}} sports were contested at the Montreal Games. In boxing and judo, two bronze medals were awarded for each <b>weight</b> <b>class.</b> In gymnastics, two bronze medals were awarded for third–place ties in the men's pommel horse and men's horizontal bar events, and a second–place tie in the women's vault resulted in two silver medals and no bronze medal awarded for that event.|$|E

5|$|For {{the first}} four seasons, {{prospect}} UFC fighters from two different weight categories were selected to compete. The fighters are divided into two teams, irrespective of <b>weight</b> <b>class,</b> with each team coached by a current UFC headliner. The teams then compete (in a manner which varies by season) with the loser being eliminated from the competition. Often, incentives are provided for the team of a winning fighter. This can include the right for their team to select the next matchup, in order to pick off fighters from the opposing team by selecting favourable matchups.|$|E
5|$|Guam-born then 24-year-old judoka Silulu A'etonu was {{the only}} American Samoan {{participating}} in a judo event at the Beijing Olympics. She had not previously participated in any Olympic games. The judoka represented American Samoa in the women's half-middleweight <b>weight</b> <b>class</b> (which includes competitors under 63kilograms in weight). During the August 12 Round of 32 (the first round), Aetonu faced Germany's Anna von Harnier. von Harnier defeated A`etonu by a kuchiki taoshi, scoring ippon. She did not advance to later rounds.|$|E
5|$|In boxing, judo, taekwondo and wrestling, two bronze medals {{were awarded}} in each <b>weight</b> <b>class.</b> In baseball, {{atypical}} rainfall {{during the games}} forced the Rio de Janeiro Organizing Committee for the Pan American Games to rearrange the schedule, and the competition for the bronze medal never took place. Mexico had to leave on the previously assigned date without playing for the third position. Therefore, the technical delegate ruled that Mexico and Nicaragua were each to be awarded a bronze medal.|$|E
50|$|Combat sports {{commonly}} {{have defined}} <b>weight</b> <b>classes</b> with specific <b>weight</b> limits. For example, each boxing division {{with the exception}} of heavyweight has its own limits for <b>weight</b> <b>classes,</b> ranging from 105 pounds for minimumweight to 200 pounds for cruiserweight and varying in range in the <b>weight</b> <b>classes</b> in between. In order to fight for a championship in these <b>weight</b> <b>classes</b> the fighters must come in to the fight at or below said weight.|$|R

5|$|After his Canadian {{coaching}} stint, Ward and his wife, Miss Ellen, {{opened a}} liquor store, Manhattan Liquors, {{located on the}} City Dock in Annapolis, Maryland, which they operated from 1970 to 1988. They had three sons, James; Robert, Jr.; and Kelly (who had two sons, most importantly Benjamin); and one daughter, Kathleen. Kelly Ward attended Iowa State University {{where he was a}} three-time All-American wrestler and the national champion in his <b>weight</b> <b>class</b> in 1979. Bob Ward died in one of his sons' homes in Laytonsville, Maryland on April 29, 2005 at the age of 77, due to complications related to Alzheimer's disease.

Coker attended Rutgers University from 1961–1963, where he also wrestled. While at Rutgers, he participated in an aviation officer cadet program and was commissioned an Ensign in the United States Navy. After his release from Vietnam, he returned to college and graduated from the University of San Diego in 1976 with a BS in political science. He studied education and mathematics at Old Dominion University from 1982 to 1986. Coker is married and has three children; two daughters and a son, Theresa, Elizabeth, and Thomas Jr.|$|E
5|$|In boxing, judo, taekwondo and wrestling, two bronze medals {{are awarded}} in each <b>weight</b> <b>class.</b> Therefore, {{the total number}} of bronze medals is greater than {{the total number of}} gold or silver medals. An {{exception}} was the men's 84kg Greco-Roman wrestling, where Ara Abrahamian was stripped of his medal due to his conduct during the medal ceremony. Additionally there was a tie for the silver medal in the women's 100 metres in athletics and no bronze was awarded. Ties for third in swimming's men's 100 metre backstroke and men's 100 metre freestyle meant that two bronze medals were awarded for those events.|$|E
5000|$|Currently, {{international}} men's freestyle wrestling {{is divided}} into six main age categories: schoolboys, cadets, novice, juvenile, juniors, and seniors. Schoolboys (young men ages 14-15; or age 13 with a medical certificate and parental authorization) wrestle in 10 <b>weight</b> <b>classes</b> ranging from 29 to(-) 85 kg. Cadets (young men ages 16-17; or age 15 with a medical certificate and parental authorization) wrestle in 10 <b>weight</b> <b>classes</b> ranging from 39 to 100 kg. Juniors (young men ages 18 to 20; or age 17 with a medical certificate and parental authorization) wrestle in eight <b>weight</b> <b>classes</b> ranging from 46 to(-) 120 kg. Seniors (men ages 20 and up) wrestle in seven <b>weight</b> <b>classes</b> ranging from 50 to 120 kg. For men, {{there is also a}} special category for some freestyle competitions, [...] "Veterans", for men ages 35 and older, presumably featuring the same <b>weight</b> <b>classes</b> as seniors. Also, all of the men's age categories and <b>weight</b> <b>classes</b> can be applied to Greco-Roman wrestling.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Zuffa {{announced}} plans to merge the WEC's 185-lb and 205-lb <b>weight</b> <b>classes</b> with their UFC counterparts, allowing the WEC to concentrate on lighter <b>weight</b> <b>classes</b> (which eventually merged with the UFC as well).|$|R
50|$|Light-Contact uses {{slightly}} different <b>weight</b> <b>classes</b> from Low-Kick and K-1. At Belgrade {{the men had}} nine <b>weight</b> <b>classes,</b> starting at 57 kg or 125.4 lb and ending at over 94 kg (206.8 lb), while the women's Light-Contact competition had five <b>weight</b> <b>classes</b> beginning at 55 kg (121 lb) and ending at over 70 kg (154 lb). At {{the end of the}} championships, Russia was the most successful nation in Light-Contact having won five gold and two silver medals.|$|R
5|$|On January 15, 2013, then-reigning {{champion}} Rush voluntarily {{gave up the}} CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship {{as part of his}} ongoing storyline {{feud with}} then-CMLL World Heavyweight Champion El Terrible. As part of the storyline, El Terrible stated that he would not defend against someone who represented a lower <b>weight</b> <b>class,</b> so Rush moved into the Heavyweight division for a title match. CMLL held a 16-man torneo cibernetico elimination match to determine which two wrestlers should compete in the finals for the vacant title. On January 29, 2013, Rey Escorpión defeated Volador Jr. in the tournament finals to become the 13th overall champion.|$|E
5|$|Shahrkhani {{was invited}} to compete by {{specific}} invitation of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) as she was not eligible based on international and regional ranking criteria. The top 14 women in each <b>weight</b> <b>class</b> based on international rankings automatically qualified, while 8 women across all classes from Asia qualified based on the contintental rankings, with 20 total additional spots available through special invitation of the IOC, ANOC and the IJF. Unlike most Olympic competitors, she did not win her spot through a national competition because Saudi Arabia strongly discourages women from participating in sport, and thus no such competitions for women exist in the country. Other judoka in the competition had attained black belts in the sport; Shaherkani only had a blue belt.|$|E
5|$|The story {{switches}} {{again to}} Mamoru Takamura. His {{story is the}} most similar to the manga in {{that he is the}} only character in the series to have never lost a fight. It begins with Takamura as the Japanese Middleweight Champion, defending his title against the Class A Tournament winner. After winning, Takamura and the others go to a lodge in the mountains to train. While there he encounters a mountain bear that he knocks out. After having a successful boxing career in Japan, Takamura aims for a world title and receives a challenge from the World Junior Middleweight Champion, Brian Hawk. Takamura begins a strict weight management program to drop to Hawk's <b>weight</b> <b>class.</b> When they eventually fight, Takamura is victorious and becomes the new Junior Middleweight Champion of the world.|$|E
50|$|Sibby Flowers (born 1963) was an Olympic style {{weightlifter}} for the United States. Her {{coach was}} John Coffee.

The <b>weight</b> <b>classes</b> were restructured again when women {{were added to the}} Olympic program, thus Sibby holds all of her records in perpetuity.|$|R
50|$|World Beach Wrestling Championships is {{the annual}} world {{championship}} organized by United World Wrestling {{for the sport}} of beach wrestling. The first World Championships took place in 2006, alongside the resurrected FILA Sambo World Championships, in Antalya, Turkey. Only the Senior division was featured until 2010, and each age division has separate men and women divisions. There were initially only two <b>weight</b> <b>classes</b> {{for each of the}} gender divisions within the Senior division, lightweight and heavyweight. The number of <b>weight</b> <b>classes</b> expanded beginning in 2011, with the Senior men's division featuring four <b>weight</b> <b>classes</b> (70 kg, 80 kg, 90 kg, and heavyweight) and the Senior women's division featuring three <b>weight</b> <b>classes</b> (60 kg, 70 kg, and heavyweight).|$|R

5|$|In North America {{and most}} of Europe, voles predominate in the diet and shrews are {{the second most common}} food choice. Mice and rats form the main {{foodstuffs}} in the Mediterranean region, the tropics, sub-tropics and Australia. Barn owls are usually more specialist feeders in productive areas and generalists in drier areas. On the Cape Verde Islands, geckos are the mainstay of the diet, supplemented by birds such as plovers, godwits, turnstones, weavers and pratincoles, and on a rocky islet off the coast of California, a clutch of four young were being reared on a diet of Leach's storm petrel (Oceanodroma leucorhoa). In Ireland, the accidental introduction of the bank vole in the 1950s led to a major shift in the barn owl's diet: where their ranges overlap, the vole is now by far the largest prey item. Locally superabundant rodent species in the <b>weight</b> <b>class</b> of several grams per individual usually make up the single largest proportion of prey. In the United States, rodents and other small mammals usually make up ninety-five percent of the diet and worldwide, over ninety percent of the prey caught.|$|E
5|$|In a {{small sample}} of 11 {{deceased}} dogs, Australian Cattle Dogs had a median longevity of 11.7years (maximum 15.9yrs). A larger survey of 100 deceased dogs yielded a mean longevity of 13.41years {{with a standard deviation of}} 2.36years. The median longevities of breeds of similar size are between 11 and 13years. There is an anecdotal report of a Cattle Dog named Bluey, born in 1910 and living for 29.5years, but the record is unverified. Even if true, Bluey's record age would have to be regarded more as an uncharacteristic exception than as an indicator of common exceptional longevity for the entire breed. It remains, however, that Australian Cattle Dogs generally age well and appear to live on average almost a year longer than most dogs of other breeds in the same <b>weight</b> <b>class.</b> Many members of the breed are still well and active at 12 or 14years of age, and some maintain their sight, hearing and even their teeth until their final days.|$|E
5|$|In {{his next}} fight, Margarito moved up in <b>weight</b> <b>class</b> for a rematch with Daniel Santos, who possessed the WBO junior welterweight title. The fight {{took place on}} September 11, 2004 and ended in a {{technical}} decision victory for Santos after Margarito was cut over the right eye by an unintentional headbutt in round six. After round nine it was ruled Margarito could not continue, so the fight was decided on the scorecards and Santos led 8685, 8784 on two cards while Margarito was ahead 8685 on the third scorecard. After the loss, Margarito moved back down in weight to defend his WBO welterweight title against Sebastian Lujan on February 18, 2005. He won the fight by technical knockout in the tenth round {{and set up a}} fight against Kermit Cintron, who was in attendance for Margarito's fight with Lujan. On April 23, 2005, Margarito defeated the less experienced Cintron, knocking him down four times en route to a technical knockout victory in the fifth round at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. Margarito's next fight took place on February 18, 2006, when he defeated Manuel Gomez by technical knockout in just 74seconds in Las Vegas.|$|E

5|$|Players {{can choose}} from a cast of 20 playable drivers divided in 10 pairs. All of the {{characters}} have their own special items which are unique to them, like Mario and Luigi with Fireballs, Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong with Giant Bananas, Bowser and Bowser Jr. with Bowser Shells, Yoshi and Birdo with Eggs, Peach and Daisy with Hearts, Wario and Waluigi with Bob-ombs, Koopa Troopa (who previously appeared in Super Mario Kart) and Paratroopa with Triple Shells, Toad and Toadette with Golden Mushrooms, and Baby Mario and Baby Luigi with Chain Chomps. Petey Piranha and King Boo have the unique ability to use {{any of the other}} characters' special items excluding Luigi's Green Fireball and Birdo's Pink Egg.

5|$|The Olympic Games {{programme}} {{consists of}} 35 sports, 30 disciplines and 408 events. For example, wrestling is a Summer Olympic sport, comprising two disciplines: Greco-Roman and Freestyle. It is further {{broken down into}} fourteen events for men and four events for women, each representing a different <b>weight</b> <b>class.</b> The Summer Olympics programme includes 26 sports, while the Winter Olympics programme features 15 sports. Athletics, swimming, fencing, and artistic gymnastics are the only summer sports {{that have never been}} absent from the Olympic programme. Cross-country skiing, figure skating, ice hockey, Nordic combined, ski jumping, and speed skating have been featured at every Winter Olympics programme since its inception in 1924. Current Olympic sports, like badminton, basketball, and volleyball, first appeared on the programme as demonstration sports, and were later promoted to full Olympic sports. Some sports that were featured in earlier Games were later dropped from the programme.|$|E
