5|$|Davis is acquitted, but Freamon {{uses the}} threat of federal {{prosecution}} to blackmail him for information. Davis reveals Maurice Levy has a mole in the courthouse from whom he illegally purchases copies of sealed indictments. Herc tells Levy that the Stanfield case was probably based on an illegal wiretap, something which <b>would</b> <b>jeopardize</b> the entire case. After Levy reveals this to Pearlman, she uses Levy's espionage to blackmail him into agreeing to a plea bargain for his defendants. Levy ensures Stanfield's release {{on the condition that}} he permanently retires, while his subordinates will have to accept long sentences. Stanfield sells the connection to The Greeks back to the Co-Op and plans to become a businessman, although he appears unable or unwilling to stay off the corner.|$|E
5|$|In June 2002, the Tukwila City Council {{rejected}} a {{memorandum of agreement}} with Sound Transit that would have expedited processing of light rail permits issued by the city. Although the city council supported the Tukwila Freeway Route in 2001, the lack of service to Southcenter drove the rejection despite lobbying from elected officials in other cities. Despite fears that Tukwila's decision <b>would</b> <b>jeopardize</b> federal funding for the project, Sound Transit was granted its application for a $500 million commitment from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) later that month. The city council approved expedited permitting in 2004 after requesting Sound Transit increase the parking capacity at the future South 154th Street station and park and ride to 600 stalls, at an additional cost of $5 million.|$|E
5|$|Rieber has {{suggested}} a {{package for the}} politicians, where he would create a company that would borrow money to build both the Ulriken Tunnel, a shortening of the line from Hønefoss to Sandvika (the Ringerike Line) and electrify the railway. Since NSB based their fares on the route length traveled, financing would be covered by a surcharge equal to the distance saved; ticket price would remain the same and within twenty years the debt would be covered. The government opposed the suggestion—Trygve Bratteli commenting {{that even though the}} financing was private, it would still have to use the same funding as government debt, and <b>would</b> <b>jeopardize</b> other projects, like the Nordland Line.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Alexander DeConde {{asserted}} that requiring background checks for all gun show sales was {{the prelude to}} registration and their Second Amendment rights <b>would</b> be <b>jeopardized.</b>|$|R

5|$|After Charles {{neglected}} to reclaim Church property that Matthew Csák had seized by force, the prelates {{of the realm}} made an alliance in early 1318 against all who <b>would</b> <b>jeopardize</b> their interests. Upon their demand, Charles held a Diet in summer, but refused to confirm the Golden Bull of 1222. Before {{the end of the}} year, the prelates made a complaint against Charles because he had taken possession of Church property. In 1319, Charles fell so seriously ill that the pope authorized Charles's confessor to absolve him from his all sins before he died, but Charles recovered. In the same year, Dózsa Debreceni, whom Charles had made voivode of Transylvania, launched successful expeditions against Ladislaus Kán's sons and their allies, and Charles's future Judge royal, Alexander Köcski, seized the Kőszegis' six fortresses. In summer, Charles launched an expedition against Stefan Uroš II Milutin, during which he retook Belgrade and restored the Banate of Macsó. The last Diet during Charles's reign was held in 1320; following that, he failed to convoke the yearly public judicial sessions, contravening the provisions of the Golden Bull.|$|E
5|$|Bulgarian {{nationalism}} gradually {{emerged during}} the mid-19th century with the economic upsurge of Bulgarian merchants and craftsmen, the development of Bulgarian-funded popular education, the struggle for an autonomous Bulgarian Church and political actions towards {{the formation of a}} separate Bulgarian state. The First and Second Serbian Uprisings had laid the foundation of an autonomous Serbia during the late 1810s, and Greece had been established as an independent state in 1832, {{in the wake of the}} Greek War of Independence. However, support for gaining independence through an armed struggle against the Ottomans was not universal. Revolutionary sentiment was concentrated largely among the more educated and urban sectors of the populace. There was less support for an organized revolt among the peasantry and the wealthier merchants and traders, who feared that Ottoman reprisals <b>would</b> <b>jeopardize</b> economic stability and widespread rural land ownership.|$|E
5|$|Sound Transit {{revisited}} the routing issue during community {{meetings in}} 1997 and 1998, proposing an alternate route through Eastlake, South Lake Union, and the Seattle Center if engineering of the Capitol Hill tunnel <b>would</b> <b>jeopardize</b> the project's budget. The project's draft environmental impact statement, released in December 1998, {{determined that the}} Capitol Hill tunnel would be feasible and recommended its inclusion in the plan. Sound Transit proposed that Capitol Hill's cut and cover station be located under Broadway south of East John Street, with several entrances to serve nearby Seattle Central Community College and the Broadway business district. From the station, trains would continue south to a station in First Hill before entering the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel; and north under Portage Bay to the western University District. An additional Capitol Hill station, near Broadway and East Roy Street, was proposed by Seattle representatives but {{left out of the}} preferred alternative due to cost concerns. In November 1999, Sound Transit finalized its preferred alternative, adding a crossover north of Capitol Hill station near East Thomas Street.|$|E

25|$|In Ancient Rome, {{chastity}} {{and loyalty}} {{of members of}} a family was an important factor contributing to family honor in addition to social standing and accomplishments of that family. For example, if a married woman committed adultery, her father had {{the legal right to}} kill her whereas her husband was required to divorce her. If the husband chose not to divorce his wife, he <b>would</b> <b>jeopardize</b> his honor and be labeled as a pimp.|$|E
25|$|The Delaware Tribe of Indians (Lenape) {{became part}} of the Cherokee Nation in 1867. On 28 July 2009 it {{achieved}} independent federal recognition as a tribe. Similarly, the Shawnee Tribe separated from the Cherokee Nation and achieved federal recognition in the 20th century. The Cherokee Nation strongly opposes further federal or state recognition of other Cherokee groups. This is despite some of these groups having signed treaties in the past. The Cherokee Nation believes that this <b>would</b> <b>jeopardize</b> tribal sovereignty.|$|E

60|$|But {{why this}} {{contrast}} between the forecastle and the quarter-deck, between the man-of-war's-man and his officer? Because, though war <b>would</b> equally <b>jeopardize</b> the lives of both, yet, while it held out to the sailor no promise of promotion, and what is called glory, these things fired the breast of his officers.|$|R
25|$|On 25 January 2006, the Palestinians held general {{elections}} for the Palestinian Legislative Council. The Islamist group Hamas won with an unexpected majority of 74 seats, compared to 45 seats for Fatah and 13 for other parties and independents. Hamas is officially declared as a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union and its gaining control over the Palestinian Authority (such as by forming the government) <b>would</b> <b>jeopardize</b> international funds to the PA, by laws forbidding sponsoring of terrorist group.|$|E
25|$|United States Senators Kelly Ayotte, Saxby Chambliss, Lindsey Graham, and John McCain, and Representative Peter T. King {{suggested}} that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a U.S. citizen, {{should be tried}} as an unlawful enemy combatant {{rather than as a}} criminal, potentially preventing him from obtaining legal counsel. Others said that doing so would be illegal, including prominent American legal scholar and lawyer Alan Dershowitz, and <b>would</b> <b>jeopardize</b> the prosecution. The government decided to try Dzhokhar in the federal criminal court system and not as an enemy combatant.|$|E
25|$|At {{the age of}} 22, Crowe came up {{with the}} idea to pose {{undercover}} as a high school student and write about his experiences. Simon & Schuster gave him a contract, and he moved back in with his parents and enrolled as Dave Cameron at Clairemont High School in San Diego. Reliving the senior year he never had, he made friends and began to fit in. Though he initially planned to include himself in the book, he realized that it <b>would</b> <b>jeopardize</b> his ability to capture the true essence of the high school experience.|$|E

Some Biosphere-ites were concerned about Bannon, who had previously investigated cost overruns at the site. Two former Biosphere 2 crew members flew back to Arizona to protest the hire and broke into the compound to warn current crew members that Bannon and the new management <b>would</b> <b>jeopardize</b> their safety.|$|E
25|$|Worf {{learned that}} the Klingons were {{planning}} to invade Cardassia because of a coup {{which they had been}} led to believe was engineered by the Dominion. Worf reluctantly informed Sisko, knowing this <b>would</b> <b>jeopardize</b> his status in the empire. After the invasion had begun, Gowron traveled to DS9 to ask Worf to join him in battle. Gowron believed the Federation was unworthy of Worf's loyalty because they would not fight the Dominion. Worf felt the war was wrong and he could not support it. Gowron punished him by reinstating Worf's discommendation, but this time executing it to the full degree, by stripping him and his family of his honor, lands, and titles, effectively bringing down the House of Mogh.|$|E
25|$|The Crusade itself {{achieved}} little. Louis was a {{weak and}} ineffectual military leader with no skill for maintaining troop discipline or morale, or of making informed and logical tactical decisions. In eastern Europe, the French army was at times hindered by Manuel I Comnenus, the Byzantine Emperor, who {{feared that the}} Crusade <b>would</b> <b>jeopardize</b> the tenuous safety of his empire. Notwithstanding, during their three-week stay at Constantinople, Louis was fêted and Eleanor was much admired. She was compared with Penthesilea, mythical queen of the Amazons, by the Greek historian Nicetas Choniates. He added that she gained the epithet chrysopous (golden-foot) from the cloth of gold that decorated and fringed her robe. Louis and Eleanor stayed in the Philopation palace just outside the city walls.|$|E
50|$|Starting {{from the}} '70's, Muslim {{organizations}} in the UK requested that Muslim personal law should be formally recognized {{as part of the}} British legal system.

25|$|Experienced in the {{treatment}} of inclusive landscapes (writes Robbins), he nevertheless had {{to solve the problem of}} balancing many simultaneous visions on a painted surface. Gleizes mitigated the distortion of distance by linear perspective, by flattening the picture plane; his skies were on the same plane as the simple flat objects in front and, although scale was retained, a form in the distance would be brought to the foreground by making it bright. Every element of the painting had to be reduced to clear planes, treated as uniformly as possible, for attention lavished on any one part <b>would</b> <b>jeopardize</b> the whole dehcate balance. In 1908, although color range expanded in the winter river scenes and contracted in the summer landscapes, the horizon line consist ently crept higher and higher.|$|E
25|$|Very {{soon after}} arrival over the Sea of Japan (East Sea of Korea), at 10:35., North Korea {{reacted to the}} {{presence}} of the EC-121, but not in a way that <b>would</b> <b>jeopardize</b> the mission. At 12:34 local time, roughly six hours into the mission, the Army Security Agency and radars in Korea detected the takeoff of two North Korean Air Force MiG-21s from East Tongchong-ni near Wonsan and tracked them, assuming that they were responding in some fashion to the mission of Deep Sea 129. In the meantime the EC-121 filed a scheduled activity report by radio on time at 13:00 and did not indicate anything out of the ordinary, but this was the last message sent from the plane. Twenty-two minutes later the radars lost the picture of the MiGs and did not reacquire it until 13:37, where they were closing with Deep Sea 129 for a probable intercept.|$|E

The bill also proposes the adoption by all government bodies a mechanism wherein all written requests for information shall be responded to within two days, unless proper justification is given by the government body, subject only to the payment of reasonable fees for the viewing or reproduction of such information. To compel disclosure of information, in case a government body refuses access to such information on whatever grounds, the Office of the Ombudsman would be tapped to hear any citizens' complaints of not being properly assisted by the pertinent government body. Penalties will be levied to officials or employees who knowingly and unjustly refuse to provide access to information, or who consciously release false or misleading information.|$|E
