25|$|The {{proportion}} of women tertiary graduates reflects these trends, with high percentages of women in science in Brunei Darussalam, Malaysia, Myanmar and the Philippines (around 60%) and a low of 10% in Cambodia. <b>Women</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> the majority of graduates in health sciences, from 60% in Laos to 81% in Myanmar – Viet Nam being an exception at 42%. Women graduates are {{on a par with}} men in agriculture but less present in engineering: Viet Nam (31%), the Philippines (30%) and Malaysia (39%); here, the exception is Myanmar, at 65%. In the Republic of Korea, <b>women</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> about 40% of graduates in science and agriculture and 71% of graduates in health sciences but only 18% of female researchers overall. This represents a loss in the investment made in educating girls and women up through tertiary education, a result of traditionalviews of women’s role in society and in the home. Kim and Moon (2011) remark on the tendency of Korean women to withdraw from the labour force to take care of children and assume family responsibilities, calling it a ‘domestic brain drain’.|$|E

The proportion of female researchers has been increasing over the last decade, at a faster rate than men (5.1% annually over 2002–2009 compared with 3.3% for men), which is also true for their participation among scientists and engineers (up 5.4% annually between 2002 and 2010, compared with 3.1% for men).|$|E

50|$|Lending {{to women}} {{has become an}} {{important}} principle in microcredit, with banks and NGOs such as BancoSol, WWB, and Pro Mujer catering to women exclusively. Pro Mujer also implemented a new strategy to combine microcredits with health-care services, since the health of their clients {{is crucial to the}} success of microcredits. Though Grameen Bank initially tried to lend to both men and women at equal rates, <b>women</b> presently <b>make</b> <b>up</b> ninety-five percent of the bank’s clients. <b>Women</b> continue to <b>make</b> <b>up</b> seventy-five percent of all microcredit recipients worldwide.

In Japan and the Republic of Korea, two countries characterized by high researcher densities and technological sophistication, as few as 15% and 18% of researchers respectively are women. These are the lowest ratios {{among members of the}} Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Republic of Korea also has the widest gap among OECD members in remuneration between men and women researchers (39%). There is also a yawning gap in Japan (29%).|$|E

25|$|Chile {{has one of}} {{the lowest}} rate of female {{employment}} in all of Latin America, but women's workforce participation has steadily increased over the years. As of 2014, the employment rate of women was 51.7%. Despite the fact that 47.5% of students in college are women, many still choose to be homemakers rather than join the workforce. A 2012 World Bank study showed that the expansion of public day care had no effect on female labor force participation. The low number of women entering the labor force causes Chile to rank low amongst upper-middle class countries regarding women in the work force despite higher educational training. In Chile, poorer <b>women</b> <b>make</b> <b>up</b> a smaller share of the workforce. A 2004 study showed that 81.4 percent of women worked in the service sector.|$|E
