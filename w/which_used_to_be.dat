5|$|An ancient carved {{slab of slate}} {{depicting}} {{an animal}} {{very similar to the}} blue wildebeest has been discovered.

30|$|This {{leads to}} the {{question}} of representation, which not only refers to the input to the tool, but also to the output the tool is producing. In general, as Krieger, Grubmüller et al. [36] recommend, that quantitative results (e.g. frequencies of names/keywords, number of references through users etc.) which are very useful for SMAT in a commercial context, should be accompanied by qualitative data and additional context information (such as the indication of sources, the number of sources, extracts from the postings, links to the original pages, etc.). Otherwise, as they claim, results based on frequencies only “(…) can be misleading in the sense that individual sources and/or individual users can produce above-average amounts of partial contents” [36]. Also sentiment analyses (i.e. categorisation of content entities as positive, negative or neutral), <b>which</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very widespread with commercial SMAT, can be problematic and often not applicable for SMAT for government that deal with value-laden subjects such as migrant integration.|$|R

5|$|In {{the town}} of Broome, the maximum wind gust {{recorded}} was 153km/h (95mph), recorded at the Broome aerodrome, as well as recording 163.8mm (6.45in) of rain for the 24hours up to 9 a.m. WST (0100 UTC) on 20 April. Vegetation in this area were badly damaged, particularly the African Mahogany trees which were either snapped off or uprooted. Parts of Cable Beach were severely eroded. An area <b>which</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> covered with sand was completely covered by rocks. The eastern side of Roebuck Bay had evidence of severe erosion of the coastal terrain. At Broome's only banana plantation, almost all crops were completely lost, with 10 out of 18,000 plants left surviving. Fortunately, most buildings in {{the town of}} Broome remained unharmed, although power supplies were cut to many parts of Broome for several days.|$|E
5|$|MD 5 follows Mattawoman Beantown Road, a four-lane {{divided highway}} that {{bypasses}} {{the center of}} Waldorf to the east. The route intersects Poplar Hill Road, {{which leads to the}} house of Dr. Samuel A. Mudd. Mattawoman Beantown Road carries MD 5 north through farm fields before heading into woodland. It continues into suburban residential areas of Waldorf, passing by the entrance to the Pinefield neighborhood, <b>which</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> intertwined with several Nike Missile installations. The route crosses over CSX’s Popes Creek Subdivision before coming to an intersection with US 301 (Crain Highway). This intersection has no direct access from northbound MD 5 to southbound US 301, with access provided by Mattawoman Road. Here, MD 5 forms a concurrency with US 301 and continues north as a six-lane divided highway.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, antennas and reflectors {{tracking}} over {{a satellite}} are realized pointing the whole main body using the attitude and orbit control system (AOCS). During the orbital restitution maneuver, Chemical Station Keaping (CSK), the propulsion system cause important perturbations <b>which</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{characterized by a}} constant torque. In order to improve the pointing performance for the satellite and using the proprieties of the perturbation an average estimator was used until now. But the main problem of this estimator is it's low convergence time. The internship consist firstly in study the main characteristics of the perturbation, understand the causes of this effect and secondly study the feasibility of different solutions to estimate and correct it using the available sensors: angular speed for one axis, angular position for another and both for the last one. For that, it {{should be taken into}} account the different disturbing torques that appears during the CSK. The internship will take place in the AOCS/GNC & Flight Dynamics Studies Department of EADS Astrium, working in case collaboration with the engineering team working on the control system...|$|R
