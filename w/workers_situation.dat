In this research, TLSC's structure was examined {{as well as its}} strategies on the protection of migrant workers. There was the evaluation of those strategies {{in order to understand the}} impacts in different level. Data was collected from the in-dept interviews with 21 key representatives from the leading actors of TLSC, Thai worker's union, labor related and migrant related NGOs, migrant workers and Thai workers during October 2008 – April 2009. The research found that TLSC had used "Human Rights" as the leading concept for their movement. TLSC had the clear structure in the administrative level. The main strategies of TLSC on labor movement in Thailand included petition, campaign and education, capacity building, information dissemination in national and local level and networking. All of these strategies had been used for the movement on the protection of migrant workers as well. The migrant related NGOs who were members of TLSC had played important roles and had influence towards TLSC's activities regarding the protection of migrant workers. The strong capacity of migrant related NGOs who participated in TLSC and the sufficient database about migrant <b>workers</b> <b>situation</b> provided to TLSC leaders and members by NGOs were the main factors motivating TLSC movement on the protection of migrant workers. The impacts of TLSC's strategies on the protection of migrant workers were in three different levels; policy level, local level, and organization level...|$|E

40|$|Many {{countries}} {{rich and}} poor alike, among them Norway, have committed themselves to work to reach the Millennium Development Goals (MDG’s) 4 and 5, which focus on children’s health and maternal mortality. An initiative developed between Bwaila hospital in Malawi and the three Norwegian teaching hospitals Haukeland University Hospital, Oslo University Hospital (Ullevål) and University Hospital Northern Norway aims at {{improving the quality of}} care at Bwaila hospital by sending personnel and equipment. The overall goal is to contribute to reducing the maternal mortality in Malawi, by improving pregnant women’s access to basic and comprehensive maternal health care. The objectives of this thesis are to look at how Malawian and Norwegian health personnel perceive this health intervention and how it affects their daily work in the maternity ward. This has been done by a qualitative study with interviews of a number of health personnel who have been actively working in the maternity unit during the intervention period. The study finds that there is an exchange of knowledge and skills going both ways. Several of the Malawian health workers expressed that this intervention is an important support in tough times. This study also reveals that different incentives for working are important for the understanding of the individual health <b>workers</b> <b>situation</b> and motivation. Both monetary and non-monetary incentives like career development, equipment and personal development are incentives important for job performance. Motivation is a topic that emerges, and it is being emphasized in this study that incentives for the different groups of health personnel should be taken into consideration when trying to understand the internal dynamics of a human resource intervention programme like this...|$|E

During {{qualification}} practice course {{social work}} students (baccalaureates) {{are learning to}} identify, define, describe, analyse and apply theoretical knowledge practically in the social work. In this process of practical learning student is consulting a university practice teacher – tutor and a person responsible for the student practice in the particular organization– mentor. Teaching how to apply theoretical knowledge practically is a complicated process that requires special knowledge and skills both from the tutor and mentor. Mentors have {{to answer the question}} not only “what to teach?” i. e. how to transfer explicit knowledge, but also “how to teach?” i. e. how to transfer tacit and implicit knowledge. While supervising student’s practice, mentor is not only teaching a student to reflect a practice, but he is reflecting own social work practice through identification,generalisation, conceptualisation of practical experience. Sharing of practical experience is the background for mentor’s professional growth. Work with students is a accessory experience.

On the one hand mentor has to meet high requirements in the terms of competence, knowledge, skills, time and personal characteristics; on the other hand supervision of the social work practise is a volunteer work.

What motivates mentors to supervise students practice when relationship between higher educational institution and a place of practice (mentor) is based only on the social interchange?

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Women today {{represent}} a larger {{part of the}} American workforce than ever before. The influx of women into the workplace raises questions about differences in male and female work-related behaviors particularly in groups, and decision making. For example, existing research suggests {{that men and women}} have differing strategies in groups which lead to allocating group rewards differently. Previous research suggests that men divide group rewards equitably; with the group members receiving awards in proportion to their productive contributions. Previous research suggests that women divide group rewards equally; all group members receive the same award regardless of individual contributions to the group. This study sought to determine reward allocation behavior of men and women. The subjects, who were advanced business students, acted as impartial third parties and made allocation decisions for two <b>workers</b> in <b>situations</b> involving differences in productivity, duration of work, and the expected future interaction of the workers. The subjects were further classified by Dr. Sandra Bern's Sex-Role Inventory as "Masculine", "Feminine", or "Androgynous". Although other studies have reported male and female differences, no biological sex difference in reward allocation behavior was found in this study. No psychological gender difference in reward allocation behavior was found in the <b>worker</b> <b>situations</b> involving productivity and duration of work. However, the situation which involved the expected future interaction of workers did produce differing allocation responses by psychological gender categories. In summary, this study found that advanced business students will most often allocate rewards on the basis of productivity. When the factor of future interaction of the workers was introduced "Feminine" males, and "Masculine" and "Androgynous" females did not use this criterion, however. The results of this study may be explained by the particular subject pool, by the bi-polar nature of the situations and decisions, or by the inapplicability of the theory at this time. Cross-sex gender identification is found to confound allocation decision making in a <b>situation</b> where the <b>workers</b> will interact in the future...|$|R

As a matter of fact, we find clear evidence of heterogeneous parts, each one with high homo-geneity, representing situations well identified in terms of activity and wage levels and in degree of stability in the workplace.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} the prospect alleviating {{the legal and}} social circumstances of the farm worker in the SADC region through the SADC’s SLRSF – a regional institutional mechanism dedicated to the SADC region’s land question. The farm worker in the SADC region constitutes a class that historically possesses insecure and non-registrable rights and interests characterised as personal and non-proprietary. This in turn places the farm worker class in a precarious risk prone position with damaging effects socially, economically and developmentally. Contemporary responses to {{the situation of the}} farm worker have been mixed as illustrated by the different legal frameworks applicable in South Africa and Malawi. Since the farm worker’s question is primarily identified {{as an example of the}} damaging effects of insecure tenure and of livelihoods under constant threat of unregulated eviction an attempt is made to locate the farm <b>worker’s</b> <b>situation</b> within the international human rights framework provided for under Articles 17 of International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and 11 the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Civil Rights.
