40|$|Lotus corniculatus L. is a {{perennial}} forage legume species highly-adapted to growth under drought conditions. However, the genetic and physiological mechanisms involved in its adaptive capacity {{have not been}} elucidated. The role of osmotic adjustment (OA) and water-use efficiency (WUE) on the drought tolerance of L. corniculatus was studied in a greenhouse experiment. Seven cultivars of different origin were subjected to two contrasting treatments of available soil water: No water stress (NWS) and with water stress (WWS). Xylem water potential (Ψx), osmotic potential (Ψπ), pressure potential (Ψp), relative water content (RWC), stomatal conductance (g <b>s),</b> <b>shoot</b> DM production, water transpiration (T), and WUE (shoot DM/T) were measured. Water treatments significantly (P < 0. 05) affected plant water status, which was reflected in reduced Ψx, RWC, g s, and transpiration rate in the WWS treatment compared with the NWS treatment. All cultivars showed a high capacity for OA under WWS treatment because Ψπ decreased by approximately 60 % and Ψp increased by approximately 30 %, compared with the NWS treatment. Cultivars with a higher solute accumulation (low Ψπ value) had the lowest DM production under WWS treatment. In contrast, WUE varied greatly among cultivars and was positively associated (R² = 0. 88; P < 0. 01) with DM production under drought conditions...|$|R

In Brazil, information on Se in agricultural crops is extremely scarce, though there are indications that low levels of Se are being consumed by the population.

Soil temperature and water potential measurements taken immediately adjacent to the observation windows indicated a minimal disturbance {{was caused by the}} presence of these chambers. For the three species initiation of root growth was observed before initiation of shoot activity, furthermore, active root growth extended over much longer periods during the year than shoot growth. Initial growth was observed for the three species in the upper soil layers in the spring. Later in the season most of the growth activity was measured at progressively greater depths in the soil. Measurable root growth was observed for Atriplexin August when the soil water potentials were in the range of - 70 bars for 1972, and at water potentials of - 60 bars for all three species during 1973. Detectable growth for these three species was recorded as late as January in 1974. Except for the main extension roots, individual apical meristems were seldom active for more than 2 weeks. Atriplex confertifolia and Ceratoides lanata plots were labeled during the growth season with 14 Co 2 in polyethylene enclosures to study both the partitioning of photosynthates to plant parts and their total allocation of carbon at the community level. A definite seasonal pattern of partitioning of recent photoassimilates corresponding to phenological events emerged. In the spring, photoassimilates were principally directed to shoot growth, especially expanding new leaves and vegetative buds. In terms of relative energy allocated to plant parts per unit dry weight basis, it appears that Ceratoides lanata expends less energy for reproductive organs. For both species, carbon used for new stems and previous years shoot growth appears to constitute a significant sink for energy use and storage. Relative translocation of carbon to roots was minimal during the spring for both species. It increased with the progression of the season reaching a maximum in July for Atriplex {{and at the end of}} the season for Ceratoides. Energy allocation at the community level for these species showed that approximately 60 and 40 percent of the recently photoassimilated 14 C for the Atriplex-dominated community in July and September, respectively, appeared localized in the new shoot growth, the remaining was distributed in nearly equal amounts between previous year 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>shoot</b> growth and the root system. The scheme of energy allocation in Ceratoides showed similar patterns of carbon utilization in July and September; approximately 80 percent of the fixed carbon was al located in approximately equal amounts to roots and new shoot growth with the remainder to the previous year 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>shoot</b> growth. In the Ceratoides-dominated community 65 percent and 36 percent of 14 C photoassimilated in April and July, respectively, and still remaining in the plant by September, was localized in the underground structures.

40|$|The uptake of {{hydrogen}} sulfide (H 2 <b>S)</b> by <b>shoots</b> of curly kale (Brassica oleracea) showed saturation kinetics {{with respect to}} the atmospheric concentration. The kinetics are largely determined by the rate of metabolism of the absorbed H,S into cysteine, catalyzed by O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase, and can be described by the Michaelis-Menten equation. When B. oleracea was grown under sulfate (SO 42 -) -deprived conditions, plants developed sulfur (S) deficiency symptoms and H,S uptake kinetics were substantially altered. Shoots of SO 42 - -deprived plants had a lower affinity to H 2 S uptake, whereas the maximal H 2 S uptake rate was higher. When SO 42 [...] deprived plants were simultaneously exposed to 0. 2 mul l(- 1) H 2 S all S deficiency symptoms disappeared and H,S uptake kinetics returned rapidly to values observed for S-sufficient shoots. The activity of the H,S-fixating enzyme O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase was hardly affected upon either prolonged H 2 S exposure or SO 42 - deprivation. Evidently, the activity of O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase was not the rate-limiting step in the H 2 <b>S</b> uptake by <b>shoots.</b> The significance of the in situ availability and rate of synthesis of the substrate O-acetylserine for O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase as determining factor in the uptake kinetics of H 2 S needs further evaluation.

We are particularly interested in high-dimensional {{multiple regression}} analysis where a large number of predictors is available. The lasso has become a popular estimator to reduce the dimensionality of such high-dimensional regression models by imposing sparsity on the estimated regression parameters. As such, the lasso performs variable selection since it only keeps a few predictors and discards the remaining predictors by setting their respective parameter estimates to zero. The lasso is, however, not a robust estimator. Nevertheless, outliers, i. e. atypical observations, frequently occur in high-dimensional data sets.
