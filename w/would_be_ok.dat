500|$|Telegraph Avenue, {{adapted from}} {{an idea for}} a TV series pilot that Chabon was asked to write in 1999, is a social novel set on the borders between Oakland and Berkeley in the summer of 2004 that sees a [...] "large cast of {{characters}} grapple with infidelity, fatherhood, crooked politicians, racism, nostalgia and buried secrets." [...] Chabon said upon publication {{in an interview with the}} San Francisco Chronicle that the novel concerns [...] "the possibility and impossibility of creating shared community spaces that attempt to transcend the limits imposed on us by our backgrounds, heritage and history." [...] Five years in gestation, Telegraph Avenue had a difficult birth, Chabon telling the Guardian newspaper, [...] "I got two years into the novel and got completely stymied and felt like it was an utter flop.... I had to start all over again, keeping the characters but reinventing the story completely and leaving behind almost every element." [...] After starting out with literary realism with his first two novels and moving into genre-fiction experiments from The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay onward, Chabon feels that Telegraph Avenue is a significant [...] "unification" [...] of his earlier and later styles, declaring in an interview, [...] "I could do whatever I wanted to do in this book and it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>OK</b> even if it verged on crime fiction, even if it verged on magic realism, even if it verged on martial arts fiction.... I was open to all of that and yet I didn't have to repudiate or steer away from the naturalistic story about two families living their everyday lives and coping with pregnancy and birth and adultery and business failure and all the issues that might go into making a novel written in the genre of mainstream quote-unquote realistic fiction, that that was another genre for me now and I felt free to mix them all in a sense." [...] The novel has been optioned by film producer Scott Rudin (who previously optioned and produced Wonder Boys), and Cameron Crowe is adapting the novel into a screenplay, according to Chabon.|$|E
2500|$|Much {{like other}} black jazz artists {{of that time}} such as Billy Eckstine and Nat King Cole, it was {{particularly}} difficult for Matthews to break prejudice and color barriers. [...] He said at the time: [...] "They said the band was too mixed, a couple of whites {{or a couple of}} Negroes <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>O.K.</b> but not 50/50." [...] He was confronted by an agent who hired an all-white group for a Las Vegas show rather than Matthews' mixed band. [...] His frustration extended to A representatives for Decca, Columbia, and Capitol, who liked the sound of the band and his music but expressed concern after seeing the racially mixed band in person.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{known as}} The Pharmaceutical Bandits, the band began their career by {{participating}} in the third wave ska revival of the 1990s. In 1997, they released Those Damn Bandits, which featured guest appearances by Jimmy the Robot of the Aquabats and Chris Colonnier of Jeffries Fan Club and The Forces of Evil. Noting the Bandits' potential, a Los Angeles Times review of the album said [...] "Now comes a young, talented ska band, the Pharmaceutical Bandits. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>OK</b> with me if the Grinch spared them but swiped their ska records and left a shelf of Who, Clash, Bob Marley, Elvis Costello and Neil Young." [...] Matt Embree attended Los Alamitos High School, which was an incubator for other third wave ska bands such as Reel Big Fish, Save Ferris, and The Scholars.|$|E

They approached Bradbury, author of Fahrenheit 451, for permission to reprint one of his stories. When it was granted, they sent the author {{a copy of the}} magazine. ‘He liked it,’ Clark said. Bradbury's agent contacted Clark and said {{the author would like to}} submit a new story. <b>Would</b> that <b>be</b> <b>OK?</b> Clark said pretty quickly it would." ...|$|R
500|$|American {{pop singer}} Nick Jonas sang an {{acoustic}} {{version of the}} song in July during his concert at the Westfield Century City in Los Angeles. Before the performance Jonas announced: [...] "Do you guys mind if I play a couple of songs I like from pop radio right now? <b>Would</b> that <b>be</b> <b>OK?</b> The only problem is, I don't know all the words. So if you know them, sing along." [...] After watching the performance online, Gaga posted his cover on her Twitter account along with the words [...] "Swoon! Nick Jonas singing The Edge of Glory. On my way to press conference in Taichung, listening to it. So dreamy! X." [...] British band Friendly Fires covered the song during BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. Kevin O'Donnell of Spin praised their cover writing: [...] "Gaga's original showcases the pop star's gale force pipes, and Friendly Fires frontman Ed Macfarlane doesn't try to match that energy. Instead, they offer a lovely, cinematic take on the song: Macfarlane croons with the heart-on-sleeve sensitivity of an emo-boy over cascading synth melodies and a breezy funk pulse. Nice!" ...|$|R
40|$|This {{capstone}} is a {{draft of}} a proposed book on positive psychology in the workplace, aimed at a popular audience. It contains a detailed table of contents and reference sources, {{as well as several}} complete or partially- complete chapters. It also includes an extended section on lawyers that will form the basis of a separate academic article. The book’s working title is Happy at Work: How the Science of Positive Psychology will Revolutionize the Workplace. Its thesis is that most modern human resources practices are misguided with an overreliance on process and metrics. Humans are treated as capital, and firms focus on their failings and weaknesses rather than their strengths. In a post-crash world such approaches are unsustainable, and positive psychology provides a new way of managing that will revolutionize the workplace. Unlike what many <b>would</b> believe, it <b>is</b> <b>OK</b> to <b>be</b> happy at work; in fact, we should be happy at work. High corporate performance requires happy employees, and the book links the science of positive psychology with its practical application to show how any company can increase happiness at work...|$|R

5000|$|How to {{translate}} the Russian term was discussed during the 49th annual American Translators Association conference in Orlando, in which Tom Fennel, a freelance translator, argued that the term [...] "constituent entity of the Russian Federation" [...] should be preferred to [...] "subject". This recommendation is also shared by Tamara Nekrasova, Head of Translation Department, Goltsblat BLP, who in her [...] "Traps & Mishaps in Legal Translation" [...] presentation in Paris stated that [...] "constituent entity of the Russian Federation is more appropriate than subject of the Russian Federation (subject <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>OK</b> for a monarchy)".|$|E

"Although we are {{assured that}} 'not every {{procedure}} that may safeguard protected speech is constitutionally mandated,' {{the implication of}} that assurance is that many are'" [...] Scalia continued. The plurality had provided little guidance in that area. He could not reconcile this due-process requirement with other cases where the Court had ruled that at-will public employees, lacking a property interest in their jobs, were not entitled to this level of process in adverse personnel actions. He found it absurd {{that there was no}} need to investigate if the dismissal was for other causes, whether erroneously believed or not., But if speech was involved, the matter <b>would</b> have to <b>be</b> investigated, after which an adverse action could proceed, even if the investigation had produced inaccurate information about the content of the speech, as long as it did not touch on matters of public concern. In the present case, for example, if the requisite [...] "First Amendment investigation" [...] disclosed that Nurse Churchill had not been demeaning her superiors, but had been complaining about the perennial end-of-season slump of the Chicago Cubs, her dismissal, erroneous as it <b>was,</b> <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> perfectly <b>OK</b> ...
