40|$|The {{objective}} of this project is to develop high yield syntheses of oxygenate products that are liquid at room temperature using as starting materials dimethy ether (DME) or methanol. The identified products include: Dimethyl Carbonate (DMC), 1, 1 -Dimethoxyethane (DMOE), C{sub 2 }{sup +} Alcohols/Ethers (C{sub 2 }AE). The technical strategy is outlined below: (A) Synthesis of DMC via oxidative carbonylation of DME instead of methanol. Since this synthesis would not co-produce water as a byproduct, {{there is a potential}} for very high DME conversions in contrast to the low (ca 20 %) conversions obtained in conventional plants. Technical emphasis will be placed on development of a supported copper catalyst with a capability for cleavage of DME into its chemisorbed organic moieties. (B) Synthesis of 1, 1 -dimethoxymethane (DMOE) from acetylene/CO/H{sub 2 } process streams obtained from commercial methane oxidative pyrolysis processes. In the overall processing scheme the syngas would be converted to DME. The <b>wet</b> <b>acetylene</b> stream would be partially condensed to retain an equivalent of water and then condensed with DME to produce EMOE. (C) Direct conversion of DME or DME/methanol to ethanol/propanol or their methyl ethers. Under the influence of functionalized alcohol condensation catalysts developed exclusively at Amoco {{it should be possible to}} achieve direct conversion of dimethyl ether (or methanol) to ethanol/propanol and/or the methyl ethers of these alcohols. Although this reaction is not currently known, a combination of key catalyst components from identified systems should result in a DME conversion catalyst to C{sub 2 }+ oxygenates. (D) Reaction of DME or acetylene with synthesis gas (CO/H{sub 2 }) or methanol. A variety of catalysts will be tested for conversion of acetylene/CO/H{sub 2 } or acetylene/methanol to propylene and conversion of DME/CO/H{sub 2 } or DME/methanol to dimenthyoxymethane (DMM) and/or other oxygenates...|$|E
40|$|A {{study is}} {{presented}} which {{is aimed at}} distinguishing among autotrophic nitrification, denitrification, and abiological processes as sources of NO and N 2 O production following wetting of dry soil. To distinguish among these processes, combinations of treatments in laboratory incubations of soil were used which included varying soil water content, autoclaving, C 2 H 2 inhibition, and NO 2 (-) addition. Biological sources of NO and N 2 O commenced within minutes of <b>wetting</b> dry soil. <b>Acetylene</b> inhibition revealed that emissions of NO were dependent on nitrification, although a combination of NO 2 (-) production by nitrifiers and abiological reduction of NO 2 (-) to NO is also possible. NO emissions exceeded N 2 O emissions, and nitrification was the dominant source of both gases when soil water was below field capacity. It is concluded that NO emissions {{appear to be more}} important when good soil aeration favors nitrification, whereas N 2 O emissions appear more important when elevated soil water favors denitrification...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess {{differences}} in the toxic potential of surface modified carbon black particles. To this end a 14 -day inhalation study was conducted in rats using nose-only exposure to compare the effects of pristine Printex® 90 with surface modified carbon black, i. e. acetylene soot particles and Printex® 90 coated with benzo[a]pyrene. This set of particles was also tested in different in vitro and ex vivo systems. On day one after the end of the 14 -day inhalation period, acetylene soot alone caused an increase in relative lung <b>wet</b> weights. Furthermore, <b>acetylene</b> soot caused the most frequent histological alterations like interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration and bronchiolo-alveolar hyperplasia. Cytotoxicity tests with human pulmonary cell lines and precision cut lung slices (PCLS) were limited due to solubility of compounds. However, measurement of the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) in Calu- 3 cells as well as the analysis of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in A 549 and 16 HBE 14 o- cells were able to differentiate between the carbon black modifications. Murine ex vivo airway preparations also proved to be a valuable model as acetylene soot was found to be the most toxic carbon black modification for epithelial cells, and the mechanism of action was linked to CYP 1 A 1 induction. In summary, the results of this study suggest that the acute inhalation toxicity of carbon black is low, but increased if the surface is coated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In vitro models with proven CYP 1 A 1 inducibility seem to be useful tools to predict the in vivo effects of carbon black, coated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, on pulmonary epithelia...|$|R
