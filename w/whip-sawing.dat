60|$|There was no {{furniture}} in the room except the wooden bunk in which he lay, and a deerhide lounge chair he had made. The stove-pipe from the kitchen led across part of one corner, and then up again into the room beneath the roof above. It {{had been one of}} Sproatly's duties since the accident to rise and renew the fire soon after midnight, and when Sally arrived he was outside the house, <b>whip-sawing</b> birch-logs and splitting them, an occupation he profoundly disliked.|$|E
6000|$|The crowded camp thinned out. The faint-hearted {{ones who}} had no courage to sweat for gold sailed away. Others went out upon their claims to build cabins and lay sluices. I found them <b>whip-sawing</b> lumber, {{building}} cabins, and digging ditches. Each day the news grew more encouraging, each day brought {{the discovery of a}} new creek or a lake. Men came back in swarms and reporting finds on [...] "Lake Surprise," [...] a newly discovered big body of water, and at last came the report of surprising discoveries in the benches high above the creek.|$|E
40|$|A partir des {{limitations}} de notre régime de négociation collective, l'auteur tente d'élaborer, à laide de certains critères, de nouvelles structures de négociation. Normand Cinq-MarsThe {{structure of}} collective bargaining both in Canada and in Quebec exhibit two major characteristics : {{a high degree}} of decentralization and a limitation in terms of the proportion of workers covered. The former results in the following effects (1) the local level bargaining practically excludes discussion of technological change, planning and standardization of fringe benefits ; (2) involves a conflict between this high degree of industrial relations decentralization and the increased concentration of decision making within the firm ; (3) creates difficulties in extending the collective agreement because of plant unit certification ; (4) promotes <b>whip-sawing</b> strikes. It is thus necessary to devise a new bargaining structure so that the contents of collective agreements can be rationally planned. Upward movement of the power center would also permit the bargaining locus to adjust to a similar on-going transformations within the business enterprise.. Encouragement of this trend does not mean strict « industry wide » bargaining since in some areas of Quebec the socio-economic realities do not call for such a system. A comprehensive approach to modernizing the collective bargaining structure would need to consider the factor and product markets, the subject matter to be negotiated, the desire of the workers, government policy and the relative bargaining power of the parties. The type of negotiating unit should also vary with industry concentration ratios, and indeed the rate of change in these ratios should condition the speed and direction of the transformation of existing bargaining units...|$|E
60|$|Lon served {{supper at}} one end of the table of <b>whip-sawed</b> spruce, and we fell to eating. A howling of the dogs took the woman to the door. She opened it an inch and listened.|$|R
60|$|Palitlum fumbled {{under his}} shirt and drew forth a beaded sheath, and from the sheath, a knife. It was a knife home-wrought and crudely {{fashioned}} from a <b>whip-saw</b> file; a knife such as one may find possessed by old men in a hundred Alaskan villages.|$|R
60|$|For boat-building {{purposes}} {{they purchased}} a good <b>whip-saw,</b> a cross-cut saw, a jack plane, and a draw knife, {{a large and}} a small axe, a hammer, brace and bits, six pounds of assorted nails, several pounds of oakum for calking, and some pitch. To this outfit was added fifty yards of three-quarter-inch rope.|$|R
60|$|A {{week later}} found the party {{building}} in earnest. Over a hundred dollars' worth of lumber had been purchased, {{and it had}} cost as much again to bring it over. In the meantime Earl and Randy, aided by Fred, had brought out from the woods four sticks of timber for the corner posts of the cabin and had <b>whip-sawed</b> two-score of rough boards. With this material they went to work, and four pairs of willing hands soon caused the building to take definite shape. Seeing them at work, the other miners also got at it, and soon there was sawing and hammering all day long beneath the cliff.|$|R
50|$|Pisgah Methodist Episcopal {{church was}} built in 1839, on Sec. 4, T. 12, R. 10 W., and {{completed}} {{in the autumn of}} 1840. John M. Reese was the architect and builder. The timber for the frame was hewn and the weather-boards sawn with a <b>whip-saw.</b> On the night of December 24, 1877, it was destroyed by fire. Since the church was burned the society holds its meetings in the district school-house. It {{is said to be the}} first Methodist Episcopal society organized in the township; when it was the first organized there is no written record. The society is in good working condition, and since 1840 has under its watchcare a Sabbath-school which numbers sixty scholars, which also meets in the district school-house.|$|R
5000|$|In 1808, Samuel May {{emigrated to}} Floyd County from Virginia and married Cathrine Evans. From 1817 to 1821, May {{acquired}} 350 acre of land {{along the banks}} of the Levisa Fork, where he developed a farm and set up a mill. [...] Construction of the home was very laborious due to the homes remote location in Eastern Kentucky. In 1816, May's slaves began working the kilns that produced the bricks for the residence. Lime for the cement was created by crushing the shells of freshwater clams gathered from the Levisa Fork. The lumber used in the construction was <b>whip-sawed</b> from logs and was hauled to the site, where it was cured and shaped. Even the nails had to be shipped in from a factory in Abingdon, Virginia.|$|R
5000|$|Mariposa County's {{original}} {{seat was}} a now-nonexistent hamlet known as Agua Fria (Spanish for [...] "cold water"), about 3 miles directly west of Mariposa proper on Agua Fria Road, which runs from Highway 140 to the south, {{to the community}} of Mt. Bullion to the northwest. Charles Fremont moved the county seat to Mariposa in 1854, resulting {{in the construction of}} the Mariposa County Courthouse, whose grounds occupies an entire block. The historic structure is fronted by Bullion Street; Jones Street is to the rear, with 9th and 10th Streets on either side. This handsome, white judicial building erected with <b>whip-sawed</b> wood from nearby forests is the oldest courthouse still in use in California: cases are still tried there to this day. The courthouse is so recognizable that its likeness is on the Mariposa County Seal. Also particularly noteworthy is the courthouse's clock tower and bell, which chimes every hour, on the hour, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.|$|R
60|$|Having {{just enough}} {{imagination}} {{to carry him}} through each successive day, and no more, he was tranquilly sure of himself; and from the very same cause {{he was not in}} the least conceited. It is your imaginative superior who is touchy, overbearing, and difficult to please; but every ship Captain MacWhirr commanded was the floating abode of harmony and peace. It was, in truth, as impossible for him to take a flight of fancy as it would be for a watchmaker to put together a chronometer with nothing except a two-pound hammer and a <b>whip-saw</b> in the way of tools. Yet the uninteresting lives of men so entirely given to the actuality of the bare existence have their mysterious side. It was impossible in Captain MacWhirr's case, for instance, to understand what under heaven could have induced that perfectly satisfactory son of a petty grocer in Belfast to run away to sea. And yet he had done that very thing at the age of fifteen. It was enough, when you thought it over, to give you the idea of an immense, potent, and invisible hand thrust into the ant-heap of the earth, laying hold of shoulders, knocking heads together, and setting the unconscious faces of the multitude towards inconceivable goals and in undreamt-of directions.|$|R
60|$|A month passed by, and Bonanza Creek {{remained}} quiet. A {{sprinkling of}} men had staked; {{but most of}} them, after staking, had gone on down to Forty Mile and Circle City. The few that possessed sufficient faith to remain were busy building log cabins against the coming of winter. Carmack and his Indian relatives were occupied in building a sluice box and getting a head of water. The work was slow, for they had to saw their lumber by hand from the standing forest. But farther down Bonanza were four men who had drifted in from up river, Dan McGilvary, Dave McKay, Dave Edwards, and Harry Waugh. They were a quiet party, neither asking nor giving confidences, and they herded by themselves. But Daylight, who had panned the spotted rim of Carmack's claim and shaken coarse gold from the grass-roots, and who had panned the rim at a hundred other places {{up and down the}} length of the creek and found nothing, was curious to know what lay on bed-rock. He had noted the four quiet men sinking a shaft close by the stream, and he had heard their <b>whip-saw</b> going as they made lumber for the sluice boxes. He did not wait for an invitation, but he was present the first day they sluiced. And at the end of five hours' shovelling for one man, he saw them take out thirteen ounces and a half of gold.|$|R
