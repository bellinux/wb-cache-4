As Burton Watson remarks in The Selected Poems of Du Fu, [...] "There are many different ways to approach the problems involved in translating Du Fu, which is <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> as many different translations as possible" [...] (p. xxii). The translators have had to contend with bringing out the formal constraints of the original without sounding laboured to a Western ear (particularly when translating regulated verse, or lǜshi), and accommodating the complex allusions contained particularly in the later works (Hawkes writes that [...] "his poems do not as a rule come through very well in translation"—p. ix). One extreme on each issue is represented by Kenneth Rexroth's One Hundred Poems From the Chinese. His are free translations, which seek to conceal the parallelisms through enjambement and expansion and contraction of the content; his responses to the allusions are firstly to omit most of these poems from his selection, and secondly to [...] "translate out" [...] the references in those works which he does select.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} Miles Morales {{was first}} reported by USA Today on August 2, 2011, {{shortly before the}} character officially debuted in Ultimate Fallout #4. The announcement received international coverage {{in the mainstream media}} and was met with mixed reactions by audiences. Chris Huntington of The New York Times lauded the creation of Morales, relating that it gave his adopted Ethiopian son Dagim a superhero who looks like him. Some fans and commentators felt the decision was an attempt by Marvel Comics to be politically correct and that the introduction of a minority Spider-Man was simply a publicity stunt to attract more readers, while others felt that a person of color as Spider-Man would set a positive example for minority readers, particularly children. Many Spider-Man fans were disappointed that Peter Parker was killed, regardless of who replaced him. The wide-ranging critical reception prompted The Washington Post to run an article called, [...] "Sorry, Peter Parker. The response to the black Spider-Man shows <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> one", in which writer Alexandra Petri wrote that the character should be judged on the quality of its stories rather than on his appearance or ethnicity.|$|E

The review was later ordered on July 3. However, the decision for an {{internal review}} was criticized, with many calling for an independent inquiry. Among the critics was Darryl Davies, a criminologist from Carleton University, who had made a report for the RCMP in 2009 about the Mayerthorpe tragedy which left four RCMP officers dead; the report recommended officers be immediately given training and equipped with high-powered firearms. Davies alleged that his report was ignored by the RCMP and believes that an internal review will not result in long-term changes, saying, [...] "I think an internal inquiry {{is not going to}} be transparent, number one — that's <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> a public inquiry." ...|$|E
