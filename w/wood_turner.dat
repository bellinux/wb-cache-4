2500|$|Duckpin bowling is a {{variation}} of bowling that uses balls which are significantly smaller than those used in ten-pin bowling, weighing [...] each, which are devoid of finger holes. The pins are correspondingly shorter and lighter than their ten-pin equivalents. Hence, when the pins are knocked down, they resemble a [...] "flock of flying ducks". While the rules remained almost identical {{to those of the}} Ten-pin game, one rule change was made: A bowler is allowed to use three bowls on each turn. Strikes would still be strikes and spares still spares, but when all pins were knocked down on the third ball, it counts as a score of ten. During the summer of 1900, some bowlers at Diamond Alleys in Baltimore, Maryland thought it might be interesting to resize the pins to match the 6-inch ball. Thus, the inventor of duckpin bowling, John Van Sant, used a <b>wood</b> <b>turner</b> to do exactly that.|$|E
