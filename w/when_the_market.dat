5|$|A Bronze Age {{cemetery}} and {{the remains of}} an Iron Age settlement have been discovered in the village. Historians also believe Navenby was a significant staging point on the Roman Ermine Street, as the Romans are reported to have maintained a small base or garrison in the village. Navenby became a market town after receiving a charter from Edward the Confessor in the 11th century. The charter was later renewed by William Rufus, Edward III and Richard II. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> fell into disuse in the early 19th century, Navenby returned to being a village.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} nineteenth century the kelp {{industry}} provided significant employment on some of the Orkney islands, but <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> collapsed between 1830 and 1832 it caused considerable hardship. North Ronaldsay was especially hard-hit and several families were allowed to resettle from there to develop land at Westside on Eday. Rising populations meant increasing land values, especially for small tenancies. In 1843 crofts were valued at £1/acre on Eday, nearly three times the price for larger farms. However, the 20th century saw decline. Immigration from mainland Scotland was essentially unknown even in the late 1950s and the population in 2001 was about an eighth of the total 160 years earlier.|$|E
5|$|With few fixed {{structures}} in the main marketplace, the plain traditionally served as a public open space on days <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> was not operational. Before the Reformation in the 1530s, its main use was as a venue for religious festivals, particularly the annual procession of the Craft Guilds at Corpus Christi. Most public religious festivals were abandoned following the Reformation and the subsequent dissolution {{of many of the}} mediaeval guilds, and the leading event on Norwich's civic calendar became the annual inauguration of the mayor, which took place each May.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to test whether changes in <b>the</b> <b>marketing</b> margin betweenthe farm and the retail prices can result in an {{asymmetric}} relationship between the farm and the retail prices in <b>the</b> rice <b>market</b> of Taiwan. By separating the transaction cost variation into two regimes, this paper utilizes a two-regime TVECM with the error correction term serving as the threshold variable to create a non-linear threshold model.

5|$|Janice Dickinson {{describes}} her early life where she suffered {{child abuse and}} physical abuse {{at the hands of}} her father. She writes that her three sisters and mother also experienced abuse from her father. She recounts her ups and downs during her career while finding success in the fashion industry. She emphasizes how bravery is important to success, and explains how she remained firm on her request for US$20,000 for a modeling position <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> figure at the time was only $5,000. Throughout the process she experiences emotional pain from relationships that lack depth, and learns for herself about the harms of substance dependence. Incidents related to her drug addiction problems include ingesting heroin from Gia Carangi prior to a photography session in Italy, and an experience in a state of alcohol intoxication falling off a fashion runway for Valentino Garavani and landing upon Sophia Loren.|$|E
5|$|The first {{science fiction}} magazine, Amazing Stories, {{appeared}} in 1926. By {{the end of}} the 1930s, the genre was flourishing in the United States, but World War II and its attendant paper shortages led to the demise of several magazines. In the late 1940s, the market began to recover. From a low of eight active US magazines in 1946, the field expanded to 20 just four years later. Galaxys appearance in 1950 was part of this boom. According to sf historian and critic Mike Ashley, its success was the main reason for a subsequent flood of new releases: 22 more science fiction magazines appeared by 1954, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> dipped again as a side effect of US Senate hearings into the putative connection between comic books and juvenile delinquency.|$|E
5|$|The same year, {{the family}} moved to Deurne, a suburb of Antwerp, where he came in contact with nature and with scouting, which both had a {{profound}} impact on his character and his later work. With the scouts, he became the troop reporter, writing down heavily illustrated reports on their outings and adventures, in a similar vein as what Hergé did in his scouting period. Through the scouts, he also came into contact with Le Boy-Scout Belge, the Walloon scouting magazine where Hergé made Totor, his first published comic. Vandersteen made a few sequels to these adventures for his friends as amusement, which are the earliest preserved comics he made. He continued to follow the work of Hergé later on. Meanwhile, Vandersteen combined his studies at the Academy with his work in his father's workshop until 1935, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> for stone decorations for houses collapsed.|$|E

50|$|A stock with a beta of 2 has returns that change, on average, by {{twice the}} {{magnitude}} of <b>the</b> overall market; <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>market's</b> return falls or rises by 3%, the stock's return will fall or rise (respectively) by 6% on average. (However, because beta also depends on the correlation of returns, there can be considerable variance about that average; the higher the correlation, the less variance; the lower the correlation, the higher the variance.) Beta can also be negative, meaning the stock's returns tend {{to move in the}} opposite direction of <b>the</b> <b>market's</b> returns. A stock with a beta of −3 would see its return decline 9% (on average) <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>market's</b> return goes up 3%, and would see its return climb 9% (on average) if <b>the</b> <b>market's</b> return falls by 3%.|$|R

25|$|Since 2010, the U.S. Treasury {{has been}} obtaining {{negative}} real {{interest rates on}} government debt, meaning the inflation rate {{is greater than the}} interest rate paid on the debt.

25|$|During the Crash of 1929 {{preceding}} the Great Depression, margin requirements were only 10%.

25|$|An inverse ETF, {{like any}} {{leveraged}} ETF, needs to buy <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>market</b> rises and sell when it falls {{in order to}} maintain a fixed leverage ratio. This results in a volatility loss proportional to the market variance. Compared to a short position with identical initial exposure, the inverse ETF will therefore usually deliver inferior returns. The exception is if the market declines significantly on low volatility so that the capital gain outweighs the volatility loss. Such large declines benefit the inverse ETF because the relative exposure of the short position drops as the market fall.|$|E
