5|$|A popular workmen's train (one penny per journey) ran between Ludgate Hill and Victoria via Herne Hill from 1865. Trains {{left from}} both termini at 04:55 and {{returned}} at 18:15. The LCDR <b>was</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> operate this service by Parliament {{to compensate for}} the large number of working-class homes destroyed in Camberwell during the construction of the City Branch. Regular one-way fares to Ludgate Hill were eightpence, sixpence and fourpence for first, second and third class respectively (or return for one shilling, ninepence and sevenpence respectively), with journey times of 15 minutes on express trains and 26 minutes when calling at all stops.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the war, the Ho-Chunk tribe <b>was</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> cede the lead mining region to the United States. The Americans also {{increased}} their military presence on the frontier, building Fort Winnebago and reoccupying two other abandoned forts. The conflict convinced some officials that Americans and Indians could not live peaceably together, and that the Natives should be compelled to move westward, a policy known as Indian removal. The Winnebago War preceded the larger Black Hawk War of 1832, which involved many of the same people and concerned similar issues.|$|E
5|$|Each platoon {{now had a}} Lewis gun {{section and}} a section that {{specialised}} in throwing hand-grenades (then known as bombs), each section <b>was</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> provide two scouts to carry out reconnaissance duties. Each platoon was expected to provide mutual fire support in the attack they were to advance, without halting; but leap frogging was accepted, with the lead platoon taking an objective and the following platoons passing through them and onto the next objective, while the Lewis gunners provided fire support. Grenades were used for clearing trenches and dugouts, each battalion carried forward two trench mortars to provide fire support.|$|E

5|$|In January 1886 David {{spent a week}} in Auckland {{hospital}} undergoing {{surgery to}} treat stunted muscles in his left leg which had led to curvature of his spine. His mother became sick that same year, and in 1887 lost her teaching position. His mother's condition worsened and she died of cancer on 9September 1887. With a father in his seventies, the 13-year-old David <b>was</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> leave school so he could help his brothers to support the family.

5|$|Odoacer {{advanced}} on Ravenna, {{capturing the}} city and the young emperor. Romulus <b>was</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> abdicate the throne on 4 September 476. This act has been cited {{as the end of the}} Western Roman Empire, although Romulus' deposition did not cause any significant disruption at the time. Rome had already lost its hegemony over the provinces, Germans dominated the Roman army and Germanic generals like Odoacer had long been the real powers behind the throne. Italy would suffer far greater devastation in the next century when Emperor Justinian I reconquered it.|$|E
5|$|Right {{after finding}} the prisoners, he ordered and presided over their execution: the {{governor}} of Córdoba, Juan Gutiérrez de la Concha, the former Viceroy, Santiago de Liniers, former Governor Santiago Alejo de Allende, the adviser Victorino Rodriguez, and the accountant Moreno. The execution took place at Cabeza de Tigre, in the boundary between Santa Fe and Córdoba.

Domingo French was commissioned to execute the verdict.|$|E

5|$|Thanks to the {{decision}} of Potawatomi leaders to aid the U.S. during the war, American officials did not seize tribal land as war reparations. Instead, only three individuals accused of leading the Indian Creek massacre were tried in court; they were acquitted. Nevertheless, the drive to purchase Potawatomi land west of the Mississippi began in October 1832, when commissioners in Indiana bought {{a large amount of}} Potawatomi land, even though not all Potawatomi bands were represented at the treaty. The tribe <b>was</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> sell their remaining land west of the Mississippi in a treaty held in Chicago in September 1833.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Orthez (27 February 1814) saw the Anglo-Portuguese Army under Field Marshal Arthur Wellesley, Marquess of Wellington attack an Imperial French army led by Marshal Nicolas Soult in {{southern}} France. The outnumbered French repelled several Allied assaults on their right flank, but their center and left flank were overcome and Soult <b>was</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> retreat. At first the withdrawal {{was conducted in}} good order, but it eventually ended in a scramble for safety and many French soldiers became prisoners. The engagement occurred {{near the end of}} the Peninsular War.|$|E

Resistance to the Terror spread throughout the Convention, and Saint-Just <b>was</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> address the division. Bertrand Barère and other Thermidorians have claimed that he proposed a dictatorship for Robespierre, but nonetheless some of them considered him to be redeemable, or at least useful – until he delivered his uncompromising public defence of Robespierre on 9 Thermidor (27 July 1794).|$|E

5|$|After Pipe's speech, Crawford was {{stripped}} naked and beaten. His hands were tied behind his back, and a rope was tied {{from his hands}} to a post in the ground. A large fire was lit {{about six or seven}} yards (6 m) from the pole. Indian men shot charges of gunpowder into Crawford's body, then cut off his ears. Crawford was poked with burning pieces of wood from the fire, and hot coals were thrown at him, which he <b>was</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> walk on. Crawford begged Girty to shoot him, but Girty was unwilling or afraid to intervene. After about two hours of torture, Crawford fell down unconscious. He was scalped, and a woman poured hot coals over his head, which revived him. He began to walk about insensibly as the torture continued. After he finally died, his body was burned.|$|E
5|$|Aqil angered the kaimakam (district governor) of Acre, Muhammad Kubrisi, for his {{intervention}} {{in a dispute}} between two factions of the Catholic Church in Nazareth. One {{of the leaders of}} the Catholic factions, Sheikh Yusef Elias, had been dismissed by the church and subsequently entered Aqil's protection. He requested Aqil's intercession with Kubrisi, which was unsuccessful. When Sheikh Yusef decided to take matters into his own hands by raising a group of armed partisans in Nazareth, the church <b>was</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> restore his employment. Kubrisi believed Aqil had backed Sheikh Yusef's actions and accused Aqil of sedition. Kubrisi recalled Aqil and his Hawwara irregulars to Acre, verbally lambasted them and dismissed them all from service. Aqil was deeply insulted by Kubrisi's words and actions, and subsequently left for Transjordan where he sought the protection of the Beni Sakhr tribe.|$|E
5|$|As part of {{his plea}} bargain, Bell pleaded guilty in July 1997 to {{collecting}} the names and home addresses of IRS employees, and the home addresses of FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents and police in Clark County, Washington; Bell also accepted responsibility for conducting a stinkbomb attack in the Vancouver IRS office. He was convicted of the two low-level felonies and sentenced in December 1997 to eleven months in prison followed by three years of federal probation. As a condition of his sentence, Bell <b>was</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> pay, upon his release, $1,359 in restitution for the stinkbomb attack. He was also subjected to three years of supervised release, during which he was barred from accessing computers and from possessing chemicals.|$|E

5|$|Bohemond <b>was</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> {{surrender}} Antioch to Leo. He appointed his marshal, Bartholomew Tirel, {{to accompany}} the Armenian troops, which were {{under the command of}} Hethoum of Sason, to Antioch. The Antiochene noblemen allowed Leo's soldiers to enter the town, but the mainly Greek and Latin burgers opposed Leo's rule. An Armenian soldier's rude remark about Saint Hilary, to whom the royal chapel was dedicated, provoked a riot, forcing the Armenians to withdraw from the town. The burghers assembled in the cathedral to form a commune under the auspices of Patriarch Aimery. They declared Bohemond's eldest son, Raymond, regent for his imprisoned father. Raymond's younger brother, Bohemond, also hurried from Tripoli to Antioch, and the Armenian forces had to return to Cilicia.|$|E
5|$|Cannan resumed {{command of}} the 15th Infantry Battalion in Egypt on 21 January 1916. It {{departed}} Alexandria for Marseilles on 1 June 1916, to join the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front. Cannan led his battalion into action again at the Battle of Pozières and Battle of Mouquet Farm. On the night of 8 August 1916, the 15th Infantry Battalion launched {{an attack on the}} German trench in front of Mouquet Farm known as Park Lane. Cannan's men captured their objectives, and indeed went beyond them in some places. However, the Suffolk Regiment on his flank was mown down by German machine gun fire and Cannan <b>was</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> withdraw part of his force to a more defensible position.|$|E
5|$|Coghlan {{was elected}} to the Kimberley town council in 1897. The {{following}} year Colonel Frederick Schermbrucker's youngest daughter Gertrude Mary Schermbrucker, described as an attractive and sociable woman, arrived to stay at the house Coghlan shared with his sister and mother. Coghlan married Gertrude in Wynberg, a southern suburb of Cape Town, on 10 January 1899. Around this time Coghlan's friend Percy Ross Frames invited him to join him in Bulawayo, one of the main settlements in Rhodesia, as Matabeleland, Mashonaland and the adjoining areas were now collectively called. Coghlan was receptive to the idea, but <b>was</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> stay in Kimberley by the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899. Kimberley was besieged by Boer forces, cut off by rail and telephone, from 14 October until its relief by General John French on 15 February 1900.|$|E

5|$|Critics of {{the planned}} exhibit, {{especially}} those of the American Legion and the Air Force Association, charged that the exhibit focused too much attention on the Japanese casualties inflicted by the nuclear bomb, {{rather than on the}} motivations for the bombing or the discussion of the bomb's role in ending the conflict with Japan. The exhibit brought to national attention many long-standing academic and political issues related to retrospective views of the bombings. As a result, after various failed attempts to revise the exhibit {{in order to meet the}} satisfaction of competing interest groups, the exhibit was canceled on 30 January 1995. Martin O. Harwit, Director of the National Air and Space Museum, <b>was</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> resign over the controversy.|$|E
5|$|Galena {{remained}} on the James River after the battle and returned to City Point. She shelled Confederate soldiers along the river banks and bombarded City Point to cover a landing force which {{set fire to the}} depots. On 27 June, Major General McClellan came aboard the ship to locate a new camp which was later established near Harrison's Landing. On 30 June, McClellan <b>was</b> <b>compelled</b> <b>to</b> withdraw down the James, covered by gunfire from Galena and the other gunboats. They continued to support his forces until they were transferred to Northern Virginia. Galena patrolled the river to defend transports and supply ships against Confederate raids and ambushes until she was detached from the James River Flotilla in September 1862 Galena and Monitor were retained at Newport News, Virginia, in case the Confederate ironclads building at Richmond sortied into Hampton Roads.|$|E
