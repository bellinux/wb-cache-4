5|$|At the time, the Vietnamese {{military}} was highly factionalized in complicated and unusual ways, {{and it was}} not clear where the sympathies of the respective officers lied. Thi was pro-Buddhist, but he and Kỳ had been suspected of mooting a coup attempt against Khánh in September 1964, and he had also been reported by the CIA in December 1964 as having vowed to kill Khánh. Although Kỳ had made comments hinting threats to Khánh, he was also known to be strongly opposed to nominally hardline Catholic Diệm supporterssuch as Thảowho were currently the frontrunners to launch the coup. Meanwhile, the likes of Thiệu, Có and Cang, whom the Americans favored, and were Catholic-aligned in more moderate ways, were cautious in comparison to the flamboyant and impetuous Kỳ and Thi. They maintained a guarded approach, <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> the other officers would do, rather than boldly taking the initiative. For his part, Kỳ was reported by US intelligence to have privately predicted that Khánh would be ousted in an efficient manner without bloodletting and replaced by Thiệu.|$|E
5|$|During {{the last}} weeks {{of the year in}} Albania, there was no {{fighting}} since the Ottomans did not normally engage in battle during the winter. But Krujë was still under siege and Ottoman garrisons in other areas remained. Life became harder for the population after the destruction of crops and villages and the masses of refugees. By November 22, news came to Venice about the campaigns of Sinan bey against Albania Veneta in order to pressure the Republic to accept a peace or a ceasefire. The Signoria was slow {{to come to terms with}} Mehmed due to the pressure put on it by Pope Paul, Hungary, and Naples to remain at war. The attempt to sway the Venetians failed and the campaign was cancelled. This had an adverse effect for the Ottomans since Lekë Dukagjini, Skanderbeg's ally in northern Albania, decided to work without reservation with Skanderbeg against the Ottomans. In Rome, the pope continued to hold Skanderbeg and would only give him 300 ducats to support his stay. On Christmas Eve, Paul invited Skanderbeg to a ceremony where he was awarded with a sword and helmet and referred to him as Alexander, king of the Epirotes. By 7 January 1467, a consistory convened where Skanderbeg and the pope were present. According to Cardinal Francesco Gonzaga, the pope's appeal to fund Skanderbeg with only 5,000 ducats was heard and when the Cardinals responded that the fund was minimal, Paul explained that he would send more once Italy was pacified. Paul's decision led to a fierce debate on Italy's future which left Albania's fate undiscussed. A second consistory was called on 12 January but did not result in anything favorable for Skanderbeg. Contemporaries were critical of the pope's delays but he explained that he was <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> Ferdinand of Naples was willing to offer before offering anything himself, in order not to waste funds.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Prince of Parma, Governor-General of the Low Countries in {{the name}} of Philip II of Spain, in command of an army of 60,000 soldiers, divided in various fronts, after the Spanish conquests of Maastricht, 's-Hertogenbosch, Courtrai, Breda, Tournai, Oudenaarde, among others, between 1579 and 1582, slowed his {{successful}} campaign for the moment, <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> the French would do.|$|E

25|$|The {{concept of}} a formula centred around V8-engined Fords and Holdens for the Australian Touring Car Championship had been {{established}} as early as mid-1991. With the new regulations set to come into effect in 1993, Ford and Holden were both keen to {{know the details of}} the new formula by the end of 1991, putting pressure on the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport (CAMS) to provide clarity on the matter. However, CAMS was <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> the FIA did with its proposed international formula for 2.5 and 2.0-litre touring cars.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{relatively}} cautious Thiệu, Có and Cang's preparations were well behind those of Colonel Phạm Ngọc Thảo, a communist double agent. Có {{and the other}} American-preferred officers maintained a guarded approach, <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> others would do, rather than boldly taking the initiative, and Thảo struck first. The Americans opposed Thảo, and with their support, Kỳ and Thi defeated the coup and then overthrew Khánh as well, becoming the most important officers in the resulting junta. In mid-1965, Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ became prime minister and General Thiệu as the figurehead president. They headed a 10-man junta of which Có was a part until elections were held in 1967. Có was the Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister.|$|E
500|$|Wilson conferred {{with his}} officers, {{none of whom}} was {{particularly}} optimistic about their prospects: [...] "This is the end" [...] said one. British soldier and historian Roger Marston postulates that the patrol might still have been safe had it not now pursued the king, but Wilson decided to proceed: [...] "Let's ride on Lobengula," [...] he said. Several analysts comment that this was perhaps excessively rash. Marston says that Wilson's actions [...] "had a flavour of doomed resignation about them", and suggests that the major believed no other path was open, and was therefore going for broke. The Matabele hovered around the vicinity, <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> Wilson would do next.

500|$|The main {{theme and}} {{selected}} tracks for [...] "Episode Prompto" [...] were composed by Naoshi Mizuta, {{who had previously}} composed music for Final Fantasy XI and Final Fantasy XIII-2. While he had previously been told to compose his themes based on specific scenes within the game or on developer requests, Mizuta was instead given a comprehensive description of Prompto's backstory and life history. Mizuta built up his musical image from there; {{a central part of}} the DLC was showing Prompto's more serious side as opposed to his role in the main game as a mood maker. Mizuta was purposely not told what type of sound the team wanted, with them instead <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> ideas he could come up with. For Episode Ignis, three new pieces were composed by Yasunori Mitsuda, who had worked with Square Enix staff on the music of games including Chrono Trigger, Chrono Cross and Xenogears. Final Fantasy XV was his first Final Fantasy project. The songs were performed by the Brussels Philharmonic Orchestra. The multiplayer expansion Comrades had its theme song composed by Uematsu. Titled [...] "Choosing Hope", the theme was sung by Japanese vocalist Emiko Suzuki.|$|E
500|$|The {{increasing}} {{prominence of}} Chrissie in EastEnders meant that Oberman, more than most, {{had to endure}} the gruelling schedule of working on a soap, taping up to twenty scenes a day. Although she was only in EastEnders for 18 months, such was the centrality of Chrissie to the show and storylines Oberman felt she had done 4 years worth of acting, noting {{that by the time}} of her departure [...] "Chrissie has packed into a year what most soap characters do in three." [...] This all came during a period of great uncertainty for the show; media criticism and negative publicity created immense pressure behind-the-scenes, with large-scale cast culls and speculation in the press and on the set over who may be next. In an interview with the Sunday Mirror, Oberman described the atmosphere as like a [...] "vacuum", with the cast [...] "just <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> the next stage is – It can be a bit tense but it's exciting. I really don't know what's going to happen." [...] However, the prominent role of Chrissie in the show as it moved forward meant that Oberman came out of the uncertainty with more to show than most, receiving an improved deal and extending her contract for a year, with the BBC's head of drama John Yorke declaring he had [...] "big plans" [...] for Chrissie.|$|E
500|$|When Amin became leader, {{he tried}} to reduce Afghanistan's {{dependence}} on the Soviet Union. To accomplish this, he aimed to balance Afghanistan's relations with the Soviet Union by strengthening relations with Pakistan and Iran. The Soviets were concerned when they received reports that Amin had met personally with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, {{one of the leading}} anti-communists in Afghanistan. His general untrustworthiness and his unpopularity amongst Afghans made it more difficult for Amin to find new [...] "foreign patrons". Amin's involvement in the death of Adolph Dubs, the American Ambassador to Afghanistan, strained his relations with the United States. He tried to improve relations by reestablishing contact, met with three different American chargé d'affaires, and was interviewed by an American correspondent. But this did not improve Afghanistan's standing {{in the eyes of the}} United States Government. After the third meeting with Amin, J. Bruce Amstutz, the American Ambassador to Afghanistan from 1979 to 1980, believed the wisest thing to do was to maintain [...] "a low profile, trying to avoid issues, and <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happens". In early December 1979, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed a joint summit meeting between Amin and Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the President of Pakistan. The Pakistani Government, accepting a modified version of the offer, agreed to send Agha Shahi, the Pakistani foreign minister, to Kabul for talks. In the meanwhile, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), Pakistani's secret police, continued to train Mujahideen fighters who opposed the communist regime.|$|E

2500|$|Eight {{months after}} {{the battle of the}} Yellow Ford, a new Lord Lieutenant, the Earl of Essex, landed in Ireland with an expeditionary force sent there from England of 17,000 troops. Essex found that O'Neill had been <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> might be {{attempted}} against him. Acting on the Queen Elizabeth's explicit instructions, and after some ill-managed operations in the south of country, he had a parley with Tyrone at a ford on the Lagan on 7 September 1599, when a truce was arranged. Elizabeth was displeased by the favourable conditions allowed to O'Neill, [...] as she pointed out, if she had intended to simply abandon Ireland she would not have needed to send Essex there, and by Essex's treatment of him as an equal. The Lord Lieutenant then travelled back to the Queen's court near London without permission - a desperate move, which culminated in a failed attempt to take the Tower of London against the queen's authority and his execution for treason.|$|E

2500|$|By March 2011, Arizona-like bills {{had been}} {{defeated}} or {{had failed to}} progress in at least six states and momentum had shifted against such imitative efforts. [...] Reasons ranged from opposition from business leaders to fear among legislators of the legal costs of defending any adopted measure. [...] One state that did pass a law based partly on SB1070, Utah, combined it with a guest worker program that went {{in the other direction}} (and fit into the spirit of the Utah Compact). Even in Arizona itself, additional tough measures against illegal immigration were having a difficult time gaining passage in the Arizona Senate. [...] Other states were still <b>waiting</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> the outcome of the legal battles would be. [...] By September 2011, Indiana, Georgia, and South Carolina had passed somewhat similar measures and were facing legal action. [...] Another anti-illegal immigration measure, Alabama HB 56, was considered tougher even than SB1070; it was signed into law in June 2011. [...] However, federal courts subsequently blocked many of the key provisions of these laws in those states, and other provisions were dropped following settlements of lawsuits.|$|E
