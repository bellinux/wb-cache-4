5|$|Wax {{resist dyeing}} of fabric {{is an ancient}} art form. It already existed in Egypt in the 4th century BC, where {{it was used to}} wrap mummies; linen <b>was</b> <b>soaked</b> in wax, and {{scratched}} using a stylus. In Asia, the technique was practised in China during the Tang Dynasty (618-907 AD), and in India and Japan during the Nara Period (645-794 AD). In Africa it was originally practised by the Yoruba tribe in Nigeria, Soninke and Wolof in Senegal. These African version however, uses cassava starch or rice paste, or mud as a resist instead of beeswax.|$|E
5|$|From Verbrandesmis a road runs north-west, {{parallel}} with the lower Steenbeek through Merckem to Luyghem, slightly above {{the level of the}} surrounding marshes. Machine-guns nests in the villages, commanded the causeway from Drei Grachten; the ground everywhere in the peninsula <b>was</b> <b>soaked</b> and dotted with large numbers of blockhouses and pillboxes. The French artillery destroyed Verbrandesmis and it was quickly captured but the German garrisons at Jesiutengoed Farm and Kloostermolen held out for some time, before being driven out and forced back to Kippe and Aschhoop. German artillery bombarded the banks of the Steenbeek in front of Merckem and French troops rushed across on pontoon bridges, struggled through the mud to the objectives and then attacked towards Kippe and Luyghem. Kippe and Aschhoop were captured quickly but the German garrisons at Luyghem and the causeway from Drei Grachten, resisted until afternoon before being overwhelmed.|$|E
5|$|The {{floating}} {{stage on}} which Jarre and his musicians performed {{was built on}} top of four large barges. Large purpose-built display screens were built, {{and one of the}} buildings {{to be used as a}} backdrop was painted white. One large mirror ball being transported to the event fell onto the roadside, causing a degree of confusion as some people mistook it for a fallen satellite. World War II searchlights were installed, to illuminate the sky and surrounding architecture. Along with thousands in the surrounding streets and parks, 200,000people watched Jarre and guests such as guitarist Hank Marvin perform in less than ideal conditions. Inclement weather had threatened to break the stage from its moorings, putting paid to the original plan to float the stage across the Royal Victoria Dock. Wind speeds were so high that television cameras were blown over. On the second evening the audience, which included Diana, Princess of Wales, <b>was</b> <b>soaked</b> by rain and wind.|$|E

5|$|In R v. Fiak (2005), the {{defendant}} used a clean blanket {{to block the}} toilet of the police cell he was occupying, causing the water to overflow and flood his and other cells. The defence argued that clean water had flooded on to a waterproof floor, {{and that in the}} process the blanket <b>was</b> <b>soaked</b> by clean water. The blanket would have been reusable when dry. Cleaning up a wet cell floor did not constitute damage to the cell itself. The Court of Appeal noted that this argument assumed the absence of any possible contamination or infection from the lavatory itself, and held that {{while it is true that}} the effect of the appellant's actions in relation to the blanket and the cell were both remediable, the simple reality was that the blanket could not be used as a blanket by any other prisoner until it had been dried out and cleaned. Further, the flooded cells remained out of action until the water had been cleared. Thus, both had sustained damage, albeit temporary.|$|E

25|$|Rice may <b>be</b> <b>soaked</b> to {{decrease}} cooking time, conserve fuel, minimize exposure to high temperature, and reduce stickiness.

25|$|Their efforts proved futile {{because the}} Wei forces, due to having {{constructed}} walls and other defensive structures earlier, {{were in a}} more advantageous position over them.

25|$|Xin Zhui's {{body was}} remarkably preserved. Her skin {{was soft and}} moist, with muscles that still allowed for {{her arms and legs}} to flex at the joints.

There was hair on her head, with a wig pinned with a hair clasp {{on the back of her}} head. There was skin on her face, and her eyelashes and nose hair still exist. The tympanic {{membrane}} of her left ear was intact, and her finger and toe prints were distinct. This preservation allowed doctors at Hunan Provincial Medical Institute to perform an autopsy on 14 December 1972. Much of what is known about Xin Zhui's lifestyle was derived from this and other examinations. Xin Zhui's body <b>was</b> <b>soaked</b> in an unknown liquid that was mildly acidic with some magnesium in it. More than 1,000 precious artefacts were found with Xin Zhui's body.|$|E

25|$|The bowl {{in which}} the drink is {{prepared}} is called a tanoa or laulau. The former word is the more frequently used. The bowls vary in size from twelve to thirty inches and they stand on short rounded legs varying in number from four to twentyfour. It is unusual to find a bowl that has a greater depth than six inches and the majority are perhaps not more than three or four inches deep. A brim of a width varying according {{to the size of}} the bowl runs round the top of the tanoa, and a flange or sometimes a projecting piece of the original wood is left under the bowl. This is pierced by a hole through which a piece of afa (native sennit) is threaded for suspending the bowl from a house post. The tanoa is usually made from the wood of the ifilele tree (Intsia bijuga), a hard-grained timber of a reddish-brown colour. When the bowl was finished it <b>was</b> <b>soaked</b> in fresh water for a considerable time to remove the woody smell. 'Ava often was also allowed to remain indefinitely in the tanoa in order that the inside might acquire an enamelled appearance. This enamel or sheen is called tane. In earlier bowls the legs were tapered towards the bottom and reduced there to about a half an inch in diameter. Chiefs and orators, high and low, use the same type of tanoa. At ceremonies, the bowl used is that belonging to the chief or orator at whose house the ceremony is being held.|$|E

500|$|Since {{the turn}} of the 21st century, fast food has been criticised for its animal welfare record, its links to obesity and its {{environmental}} impact. Eric Schlosser's book Fast Food Nation (2002) and Morgan Spurlock's film Super Size Me (2004) reflected these concerns. Since 2003, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) has protested KFC's choice of poultry suppliers worldwide with the Kentucky Fried Cruelty campaign. PETA have held thousands of demonstrations, sometimes in the home towns of KFC executives, and CEO David Novak <b>was</b> <b>soaked</b> in fake blood by a protester.

[...] A dirty rag tied around her head <b>was</b> <b>soaked</b> with blood from a wounded ear. [...] According to her story she had been attacked by two men near Bedlam Hospital.
