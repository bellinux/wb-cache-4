25|$|Injuries due to toe {{misalignment}} {{are often}} avoided by adjusting toe alignments with gel toe spacers. Toenail bruising {{can be caused}} by heavy pressure {{on the surface of the}} nail; this is typically prevented by keeping toenails clipped short, by <b>wrapping</b> <b>tape</b> around the toes, by using padding, or combinations of these. Bruising can also occur on the tips of the toes, especially when no padding is used. It is highly unadvised to dance en pointe without any padding at all.|$|E
25|$|Pointe {{work can}} cause {{friction}} between toes {{and the interior}} of the pointe shoe's box. This friction, under the high pressure of much of the dancer's body weight, can result in chafing and blistering. This is often mitigated with lambswool or toe pads or by <b>wrapping</b> <b>tape</b> around toes or use gel pads that can conform to any one problem area. Choosing between cloth and gel, gel, only cloth, wool, etc. for toe pads is a personal preference for each dancer but each style has its own benefits.|$|E
500|$|In the NHL, American Hockey League (AHL), ECHL, Southern Professional Hockey League, {{and other}} notable minor leagues, {{officials}} punish combatants with five-minute major penalties for fighting (hence the phrase [...] "five for fighting"). A player is automatically ejected and suspended if the player tries {{to leave the}} bench to join a fight, or for using weapons of any kind (such as using a skate to kick an opponent, using a stick to hit an opponent, <b>wrapping</b> <b>tape</b> around one's hands, or spitting), as they can cause serious injury. A player who receives two instigator penalties or participates in three fights in a single game is also ejected automatically. Furthermore, his coach can be suspended up to ten games for allowing players to leave the bench to join a fight.|$|E

5000|$|While not {{adhesive}} to the repaired object, it is self-adhesive, {{securing the}} bond well. It is supplied in rolls with an [...] layer, {{to prevent the}} tape from amalgamating before use. It may optionally be made with an iron-oxide additive which adds high thermal conductivity. This tape is used extensively in aviation and aerospace wiring applications as a splice or <b>wrapping</b> <b>tape</b> due to its non-flammability.

50|$|Non-dyed {{silicone}} rubber tape with an iron-oxide additive (making the tape a red-orange colour) is used extensively in aviation and aerospace wiring applications as a splice or <b>wrapping</b> <b>tape</b> {{due to its}} non-flammable nature. The iron-oxide additive adds high thermal conductivity but {{does not change the}} high electrical insulation property of the {{silicone rubber}}. This type of self-amalgamating tape amalgamates or fuses to itself, so that when stretched and wrapped around cables, electrical joints, hoses and pipes it bonds into a strong seamless rubbery electrically insulating and waterproof layer, although not adhesive.|$|E

25|$|Many common {{building}} materials used before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe <b>wrap,</b> <b>taping</b> muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Normally, significant releases of asbestos fiber {{do not occur}} unless the {{building materials}} are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling. Removal of asbestos-containing materials is not always optimal because the fibers can be spread into the air during the removal process. A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is often recommended instead.|$|R

50|$|However, Ms. Rojas {{refused to}} aid the assailants, instead leading them to a room where two drivers were sleeping. Both men were bound with <b>wrapping</b> <b>tape,</b> but {{even though they were}} beaten with a rifle butt they refused to give their attackers any information. Three more rooms were entered and terrified crew members were awakened with guns at their heads. The five robbers had every {{intention}} of going through each room until they located Mr. Day and his cameraman, Wes Dorman. The hostage siege had been quietly taking place for nearly an hour when the hotel owner's son, Jose Maria Pautrat, 25, arrived home from Lima. When Jose realized that a robbery was taking place he was able to leave the building and contact the police. Meanwhile, driver Carlos Rioja managed to break free and ran through the hotel calling for help. Quickly, crew members assembled and searched to find their attackers.|$|E

She slams the brakes and accelerates to throw him about. She reaches for a knife and stabs him in the knee. Andy comes over to attack her but she grabs a fire extinguisher and hits him with it.
