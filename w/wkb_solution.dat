40|$|Abstract. We {{show that}} a simple Levi {{compatibility}} condition determines stability of <b>WKB</b> <b>solutions</b> to semilinear hyperbolic initial-value problems issued from highly-oscillating initial data with large amplitudes. The compatibility condition involves the hyperbolic op-erator, the fundamental phase associated with the initial oscillation, and the semilinear source term; it states roughly that hyperbolicity is preserved around resonances. If the compatibility condition is satisfied, the solutions are defined over time intervals independent of the wavelength, and the associated <b>WKB</b> <b>solutions</b> are stable under a large class of initial perturbations. If the compatibility condition is not satisfied, resonances are exponentially amplified, and arbitrarily small initial perturbations can destabilize the <b>WKB</b> <b>solutions</b> in small time. The amplification mechanism {{is based on the}} observation that in frequency space, res-onances correspond to points of weak hyperbolicity. At such points, the behavior of the system depends on the lower order terms through the compatibility condition.

40|$|In {{our earlier}} paper ([AKT 1]), by {{interpreting}} the formal transformation to the Airy equation near a simple turning point as {{the symbol of}} a microdifferential operator, we derived the Voros connection formula or, equivalently, the discontinuity function of a Borel transformed <b>WKB</b> <b>solution</b> at its movable singularities.

40|$|In {{this note}} we extend the Differential Transfer Matrix Method (DTMM) for a second-order linear {{ordinary}} differential equation {{to the complex}} plane.

The method discussed in this paper also successfully removes the problem of dealing with essential singularities, which was present in the earlier formulations. Then we simplify the result for real-valued problems and obtain a new set of basis functions, which may be used instead of the <b>WKB</b> <b>solutions.</b> These basis functions not only satisfy the initial conditions perfectly, but also, may approach the turning points without the divergent behavior, which is observed in <b>WKB</b> <b>solutions.</b> Finally, an analytical transformation {{in the form of a}} matrix exponential is presented for improving the accuracy of solutions.
