25|$|Despite {{a shared}} {{belief in the}} {{potential}} of IoT, industry leaders and consumers are facing barriers to adopt IoT technology more widely. Mike Farley argued in Forbes that many IoT solutions either lack interoperability or a clear use case for end-users. “Instead of convincing consumers that they need complex systems to serve needs they don’t have, we should fix real problems people struggle with every day.” Many gadgets in the consumer IoT space have appealed to early adopters, yet failed to demonstrate relevance to ordinary people’s lives. “In order to boost sales and drive demand beyond the early adopter set, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> making toys no one cares about and instead work on building simple solutions to real, everyday problems for real people.” A recent study by Ericsson regarding the adoption of IoT among Danish companies, has suggested that many are struggling “to pinpoint exactly where the value of IoT lies for them”. A company must identify where the value of IoT lies in order to capture it, otherwise non-action is the consequence. This indicates that a major roadblock to IoT adoption is not technical but analytical in nature.|$|E

500|$|On 30 March 2010, Alan Johnson, {{the then}} Home Secretary, {{announced}} mephedrone {{would be made}} illegal [...] "within weeks" [...] after the ACMD sent him {{a report on the}} use of cathinones. The legislation would make all cathinones illegal, which Johnson said would [...] "stop unscrupulous manufacturers and others peddling different but similarly harmful drugs". The ACMD had run into problems with the UK Government in 2009 regarding drugs policy, after the government did not follow the advice of the ACMD to reclassify ecstasy and cannabis, culminating in the dismissal of the ACMD chairman, David Nutt, after he reiterated the ACMD's findings in an academic lecture. Several members resigned after he was sacked, and prior to the announcement that mephedrone was to be banned, the trend continued when Dr Polly Taylor resigned, saying she [...] "did not have trust" [...] in the way the government would use the advice given by the ACMD. Eric Carlin, a member of the ACMD and former chairman of the English Drug Education Forum, also resigned after the announcement. He said the decision by the Home Secretary was [...] "unduly based on media and political pressure" [...] and there was [...] "little or no discussion about how our recommendation to classify this drug would be likely to impact on young people's behaviour." [...] Some former members of the ACMD and various charity groups expressed concern over the banning of the drug, arguing it would inevitably criminalise users, particularly young people. Others expressed concern that the drug would be left in the hands of black market dealers, who will only compound the problem. Carlin's resignation was specifically linked to the criminalisation of mephedrone, he stated: [...] "We need to review our entire approach to drugs, dumping the idea that legally-sanctioned punishments for drug users should constitute a main part of the armoury in helping to solve our country’s drug problems. <b>We</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> harming people who need help and support".|$|E

Frazer said [...] "it's a tongue-in-cheek gesture. It's to give Irish people a sense of how we feel. I would be very offended if I was living in Ireland and someone came and asked me to take the flag down. That’s exactly how we feel in Belfast. People keep telling us we're still part of the UK, yet here we are without a flag". In 2006, a march in Dublin, organised by Love Ulster, had sparked riots. The Progressive Unionist Party's Billy Hutchinson condemned the clashes, while his colleague, Phil Hamilton, criticised the PSNI for not deploying enough officers to the Short Strand area on 12 January to prevent violence. The UDA's Jimmy Birch told the BBCs Radio Ulster: [...] "Every time they call a tune, we take to the streets. We are wrecking our own areas, we fight with the police, we are burning our own cars and we stop our own people going to work and disrupt our own people's way of life.

Fernando Alonso disagreed with the decision to start under the safety car as he felt it prevented him from attacking Vettel, while Sauber technical director James Key thought his team was put at a disadvantage when Kobayashi could not defend against the quicker cars after the fifth safety car period. Martin Brundle, who competed in Formula One for twelve years, stated [...] "the fact that the drivers came in almost immediately for intermediate tyres tells me that, {{on the face of}} it, the safety car was out too long", and felt that the safety car [...] "should be a last resort, not a default option." [...] However, he recognised that FIA race director Charlie Whiting had to consider the driver's visibility, and inexperience using the Pirelli wet-weather tyres led to caution. Jarno Trulli however agreed with the FIA's decisions, in particular the length of the red flag delay: [...] "It was right to wait that long; track conditions had to improve {{in order to make the}} cars drivable again. They did everything right." [...] De la Rosa and di Resta also agreed with the decision to halt the race, and Whiting stating that [...] "when it rained it was quite clear <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> the race." [...] Whiting went on to say that the opinions of the drivers were taken into account on the decision to halt the race, although he also considered the possibility of a suspension benefiting those drivers.|$|R
