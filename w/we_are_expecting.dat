2500|$|Unknown to Thackeray, The Royal Welsh Fusiliers (Headquarters, Machine Gunners and signallers) {{were trying}} to advance to relieve the South Africans, but were {{continually}} driven back and were unable to reach them. [...] By 1300 Thackeray sent a signal to Lukin stating that [...] "....Urgent. My men are on their last legs. I cannot keep some of them awake. They drop with their rifles in hand asleep in spite of heavy shelling. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>expecting</b> an attack. Even that cannot keep some of them from dropping down. Food and water has not reached us for two days – though we have managed on rations of those killed ...but must have water." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sri Lanka's Foreign Minister, Lakshman Kadirgamar, {{stated in}} a BBC interview, [...] "A lot of aid {{what has been}} coming in latterly is I'm afraid – I'm sorry to say – not very useful. For {{instance}} there was a container full of teddy bears. They're obviously given with good will, nobody says no to that." [...] The patience of tsunami affected nations was being stretched: [...] "Now the government had worked out a scheme that until 26 April everything that has come, everything that {{will be on the}} seas will be admitted tax free. After that, no!". Kadirgamar went on to say, [...] "For instance we do not need rice, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>expecting</b> a bumper harvest, anyone who sends rice is wasting their time and money." ...|$|E
2500|$|Aerial {{reconnaissance}} {{was carried}} out by both sides. Aerial photographs enabled a new partly contoured map on the 1/40,000 scale to be printed before the Second Battle of Gaza. However, each side was keen to monitor the others' preparations and the air became disputed territory. Newly arrived German aircraft attacked EEF reconnaissance aircraft during which several duels were fought, none being decisive. On 6 April five German aircraft approaching Rafa were intercepted by two AFC Martinsyde aircraft, one of which was forced to land and was destroyed on the ground, while the other went for reinforcements. Three Martinsydes arrived to attack the German formation. Aerial bombing was also strenuously continued by both sides, and while this aerial fight was taking place, hostile aircraft bombed Bir el Mazar. On 7 April a joint raid by four Australian aircraft, with several from No. 14 Squadron, bombed Gaza and the Ramleh aerodrome, hitting two hangars. At El Arish hospital, Dr. Duguid described the strong moon light on 8 April 1917, [...] "... now it is climbing the heavens. 10.30pm. It is as clear as day, and the shadow thrown on the sand is very definite. I hear <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>expecting</b> an air raid soon. The regiments are digging funk holes everywhere." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And we're {{certain to}} have it too," [...] she said. [...] "It isn't as if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>expecting</b> a great deal--only to walk about and look at things." ...|$|R
60|$|McCOMAS. One moment. If another gentleman comes, shew him {{in without}} any delay: <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>expecting</b> him.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are like}} children," [...] she replied, [...] "all of us. We {{have too much}} faith. I think that what <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>expecting</b> is a miracle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense, Tim," [...] Charlie said, {{opening the}} letter; [...] "it's the moonshee <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>expecting,</b> from Madras. He {{has come to}} teach us the native language." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "In {{these days}} of 'Do-it-yourself' <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> to 'reduce into {{separate}} and well-conceived forms' ourselves. Some of us prefer to have it done for us by a great artist." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'The {{question}} arises,' said Spottletoe, folding his arms: 'How long <b>we</b> <b>are</b> to wait. I am {{not accustomed}} to wait; that's the fact. And I {{want to know how}} long <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> to wait.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see by the Gazette you are {{appointed}} to the 66th, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>expecting</b> to see you on your way down. Had you any difficulty in getting through the passes?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We can do more," [...] Philippa declared. [...] "We {{can help}} him to judge for himself. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>expecting</b> Mr. Lessingham for dinner, Captain Griffiths. Do stay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh yes, I {{think it}} is; {{especially}} when <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>expecting</b> the Marquise,' Effie responded. Then she added, 'But here she comes now; I hear her carriage in the court.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sure, Anna," [...] she said, [...] "I {{do not see}} why {{we should}} conceal the truth from you. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>expecting</b> a visit from Sir John Ferringhall at any moment. He is coming here to tea." ...|$|E
30|$|Our {{method was}} able to achieve 93 % AUC in the DR 1 dataset extracting SURF features. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>expecting</b> the CNN to perform better, but it only {{achieved}} 91 % AUC.|$|R
6000|$|... "The fact is," [...] she explained, neither consenting nor refusing, [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>expecting</b> to {{meet some}} friends who had tickets for us"--young Mavering's face fell--"and I can't imagine what's happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] Vandermere answered, {{a little}} gruffly, [...] "I'll wait out here. Remember, Lois," [...] he added, turning towards her, [...] "that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> home to play bridge {{directly}} after tea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, my lad," [...] said Psmith, [...] "since you ask, we are not. And why? Because the air up here is refreshing, {{the view}} pleasant, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>expecting</b> {{at any moment}} an {{important}} communication from Comrade Gooch." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>expecting</b> a {{visit from}} Lamartine, who does {{a great deal of}} honour to both of us, it appears, in the way of appreciation, and is kind enough to propose to come. I will tell you all about it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mrs. Mannering {{appears to}} have your {{interests}} very much at heart," [...] Berenice said, quietly. [...] "She proved herself quite a match for Sir Leslie. I {{think that he would}} have left here at once, only <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>expecting</b> Clara back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They'll {{do their}} work," [...] he said. [...] "Still, I fancy <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected,</b> and I'm {{not sure that}} I'd <b>be</b> sorry if <b>we</b> had the thing done, and were driving home again." ...|$|R
60|$|Apparently <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>expected,</b> for a {{tall and}} proud-looking girl clad {{in white and}} with {{extraordinarily}} dark eyes, {{appeared in the doorway}} and asked in a soft voice if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> the noble Shabaka and Bes, his slave.|$|R
6000|$|... "You can't pack {{all of us}} {{into that}} dog-cart, and it's four miles, anyway, {{to the edge of}} Garberry moor," [...] he said. [...] "Do you know how <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> to get there?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>expecting</b> Stanfield on Thursday, and Peter Cunningham and {{his wife}} on Monday. I would we were expecting you! This is as pretty and odd a little French country house as could be found anywhere; and the gardens are most beautiful.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no boat coming. He {{must have}} {{landed on the}} other mole, and, perhaps, met {{somebody}} he couldn't get away from," [...] said Brown. [...] "I'll leave word that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>expecting</b> him, and no doubt he'll turn up soon after we get home." ...|$|E

60|$|December 28.--Stuck to my work. Mr. Scrope came to dinner, and {{remained}} next day. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>expecting</b> young Percival and his wife, once my favourite and beautiful Nancy M'Leod, {{and still a}} very fine woman; but they came not.|$|R
60|$|Hardly had he spoken {{when men}} came running up, {{carrying}} {{on their shoulders}} neither more nor less than palanquins--four bearers and two spare men to a palanquin--and in these it <b>was</b> promptly indicated <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>expected</b> to stow ourselves.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't. I don't {{know the}} town--never was here before--and {{we have a}} twelve-mile drive before us. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>expecting</b> the {{carriage}} every moment.

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Greta, {{tracing the}} pattern of the {{sunlight}} on her skirt. [...] "But I think that when we hope, we are not brave, because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>expecting</b> something for ourselves.

6000|$|... "We want {{only two}} {{more to be}} just the right number.

50|$|Fielding credits Bridget’s {{success to}} the fact that, at heart, it is about “the gap between how <b>we</b> feel <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> to <b>be</b> and how <b>we</b> {{actually}} are” which she has described as an alarming symptom of the media age.|$|R
5000|$|We {{know of no}} scientifically ascertainable ideals. To be sure, {{that makes}} our efforts more arduous than in the past, since <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> to create our ideals from within our breast in the very age of subjectivistculture. Max Weber, 1909 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Humph! This blow isn't {{going to}} kill anybody, {{and we want to}} take all the {{advantage}} of the wind that <b>we</b> can. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>expected</b> to make a quick trip, but we can't do it if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> going to haul down sail all the time." ...|$|R
