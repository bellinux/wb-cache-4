5|$|Events <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>duration</b> of {{less than}} about two seconds are {{classified}} as short gamma-ray bursts. These account for about 30% of gamma-ray bursts, but until 2005, no afterglow had been successfully detected from any short event and little was known about their origins. Since then, several dozen short gamma-ray burst afterglows have been detected and localized, several of which are associated with regions of little or no star formation, such as large elliptical galaxies and the central regions of large galaxy clusters. This rules out a link to massive stars, confirming that short events are physically distinct from long events. In addition, {{there has been no}} association with supernovae.|$|E

The album features ten arrangements by Kenji Ito of music he composed for Final Fantasy Adventure, Sword of Mana, Children of Mana, and Dawn of Mana. Six tracks are from the original game, two from Dawn, and one each from the other two games. The album was published by Square Enix on October 19, 2011, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>duration</b> of 45:06.

5|$|Cyclone Alibera was {{the second}} longest-lasting {{tropical}} cyclone on record in the south-west Indian Ocean, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>duration</b> of 22days. It formed on December16, 1989, well to the northeast of Madagascar. For several days, it meandered southwestward while gradually intensifying. On December20, Alibera intensified to tropical cyclone status with 10‑minute maximum sustained winds of 120km/h (75mph), or {{the equivalent of a}} minimal hurricane. That day, the Météo-France office in Réunion (MFR) estimated 10‑minute winds of 140km/h (85mph), while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), an unofficial warning agency for the region, estimated peak 1‑minute winds of 250km/h (150mph). After drifting erratically for several days, the storm began a steady southwest motion on December29 as a greatly weakened system. On January1, Alibera struck southeastern Madagascar near Mananjary, having re-intensified to just below tropical cyclone status. It weakened over land but again restrengthened upon reaching open waters on January3. The storm turned to the southeast, then to the southwest, and finally back to the southeast, dissipating on January5.|$|E

The objective of the match is to eliminate opponents by throwing them over the top rope {{and down to the}} floor. The last wrestler left in the ring is the winner of the contest.

In the region, the Cocos, North American, and Caribbean Plates converge and create a tectonic zone of continuous seismic activity. The quake struck near the eastern periphery of the Guerrero seismic gap, which extends from Acapulco to IxtapaZihuatanejo and contains enough seismic energy to generate an earthquake of up to magnitude 7.5, but it did not cause the gap to rupture. Initial estimates from the USGS placed its intensity at a magnitude of 5.8(Mw); the National Seismological Service registered the earthquake at magnitude 5.5(ML).|$|E
5|$|By 1948, Braathens SAFE's routes were so regular {{that several}} {{countries}} stated that a bilateral agreement {{would have to}} be negotiated for them to continue. However, the concession that had been granted to DNL did not allow Braathens to fly any scheduled flights. Braathens SAFE applied for fifteen-year concession on 5 February 1948; Minister of Transport Nils Langhelle from the Labor Party knew that he would be violating DNL's concession by granting Braathens SAFE a concession, {{but at the same time}} he was worried that Braathens SAFE could easily flag out to another country, from which DNL would receive no protection. The exception in DNL's concession could not be used, since DNL declared that they, through the Scandinavian cooperation Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS), were planning to start a route to the far east. The Directorate for Civil Aviation stated that it was unlikely that DNL/SAS would start such a route within a few years, and recommended Langhelle that Braathens SAFE be granted the route. Concession was granted by the Norwegian Parliament on 3 February 1949, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>duration</b> of five years. The airline had to follow the route Oslo or Stavanger – Amsterdam – Geneva – Rome – Cairo – Basra – Karachi – Bombay – Calcutta – Bangkok – Hong Kong. The concession was made conditional that Braathens SAFE built a technical base at Stavanger Airport, Sola.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the course of}} fatigue in chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) patients <b>with</b> <b>a</b> relatively short <b>duration</b> of complaints and to test which psychosocial factors predict spontaneous improvement 1 year later. METHODS: Seventy-nine patients <b>with</b> <b>a</b> complaint <b>duration</b> of less than 2 years were tested at baseline and 78 of the same group at 1 -year follow-up. During this time period, no systematic intervention took place. Self-reported improvement and fatigue severity were the main outcome measures. RESULTS: Forty-six percent (95 % confidence intervals, 95 CI = 35 - 58 %) of the patients <b>with</b> <b>a</b> short illness <b>duration</b> reported to be improved. This was a significantly (chi(2) = 20. 3, P <. 001) higher percentage compared to the 20 % (95 CI = 15 - 26 %) self-reported improvement in a previously published natural-course study among 246 CFS patients <b>with</b> <b>a</b> longer illness <b>duration.</b> Persistence of complaints after 1 -year follow-up was associated with high baseline levels of experienced concentration problems, less strong psychosocial causal explanations for the complaints, {{and higher levels of}} the experienced lack of social support. Baseline fatigue severity predicted fatigue severity at follow-up. CONCLUSION: The results showed that CFS patients <b>with</b> <b>a</b> relatively short <b>duration</b> of complaints had a more favourable outcome compared to patients <b>with</b> <b>a</b> long illness <b>duration.</b> The data also indicated that complete recovery only occurred in patients <b>with</b> <b>a</b> complaint <b>duration</b> of less than 15 months. This finding has important implications, since it suggests that after such a time period spontaneous recovery hardly occurs...|$|R

RCA Victor's early introduction of a long-play disc was a commercial failure for several reasons including the lack of affordable, reliable consumer playback equipment and consumer wariness during the Great Depression.

25|$|Duration is {{a linear}} {{measure of how}} {{the price of a}} bond changes in {{response}} to interest rate changes. It is approximately equal to the percentage change in price for a given change in yield, and may be thought of as the elasticity of the bond's price with respect to discount rates. For example, for small interest rate changes, the duration is the approximate percentage by which the value of the bond will fall for a 1% per annum increase in market interest rate. So the market price of a 17-year bond <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>duration</b> of 7 would fall about 7% if the market interest rate (or more precisely the corresponding force of interest) increased by 1% per annum.|$|E
