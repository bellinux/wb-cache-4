5|$|Chinese {{campaign}}— The Chinese campaign focuses loosely on the 1421 hypothesis and {{is about}} a Chinese treasure ship discovering the New World before Christopher Columbus. The story mainly focuses on Jian Huang, a Ming captain who has long dreamed of seeing the outside world, and his partner and new friend, Lao Chen, a large, powerful, and crude sailor, who are given orders to help expand the Ming Empire. In the beginning, the treasure fleet is attacked by Wokou pirates while still under construction. On orders of the spoiled and selfish Admiral Jinhai, nephew of the unnamed emperor, Huang and Chen save the fleet and eliminate the pirates. The fleet then embarks westward and is next seen to land in a port {{on the coast of}} India. There many of the crew, including Huang and Chen, are attacked by soldiers of the Indian Zamorin and flee with part of the fleet to a nearby island where they set up a new base and mount a rescue mission to save Jinhai and the remaining crew who have been captured by the Zamorin's troops and (as they discover) some Chinese defectors. The fleet continues west at Jinhai's insistence, although many ships turn back, and eventually are cast ashore in the Yucatán by a storm. Chen and Huang go to rescue crews of the other ships from hostile Aztec soldiers. When they return, they find that Jinhai has disappeared. Huang suspects that he was captured along with many of the fleet's crewmembers and mounts a rescue mission. Huang and Chen cut through the jungle and rescue many of their comrades, but Jinhai is not among them. Huang's small army of sailors then enters a nearby Aztec city, where they learn that Jinhai has set himself up as an emperor or perhaps a god among the Aztecs and that it was Jinhai who plotted with the Zamorin in India. Huang and Chen escape an ambush by Jinhai's soldiers and flee back to the coast through a series of caves, rescuing more of their crew along the way. Once back at the coast they set up a base and counterattack, defeating and killing Jinhai. After the battle, Huang, Chen, and the surviving crew members scour the beaches for all evidence of their presence and then sail home to China, hoping that no one <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know</b> they were there.|$|E
25|$|Loki flies {{away in the}} {{whirring}} feather cloak, {{arriving in}} the land of Jötunheimr. He spies Þrymr sitting on top of a mound. Þrymr reveals that he has hidden Thor's hammer deep within the earth and that no one <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know</b> where the hammer is unless Freyja is brought to him as his wife. Loki flies back, the cloak whistling, and returns to the courts of the gods. Loki tells Thor of Þrymr's conditions.|$|E
500|$|What I went through, only I <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know.</b> My {{knee cap}} {{completely}} {{turned to the}} right, a ball of blood forming on my leg and the bone that broke, {{without being able to}} move my body. And the pain, a pain that I wouldn't wish on anyone. The surgeon placed a big support [...] in my leg, because the bone had moved so much. Breaking a femur is always serious in itself but an open break in an athlete of high level going flat out, that tears the muscles. At 180 beats , there was a colossal amount of blood being pumped, which meant my leg was full of blood. I'm just grateful that the artery was untouched.|$|E

5000|$|Since Wakulla was {{probably}} a Timucuan word, {{it is unlikely that}} its meaning <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> be <b>known.</b> It may contain the word kala which signified a [...] "spring of water" [...] in some Indian dialects.|$|R
50|$|Over 40 {{people were}} killed, though some reports list it {{as many as}} 70. Many of the dead were charred beyond recognition, and it is unknown if an {{accurate}} number of dead <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> be <b>known.</b>|$|R
500|$|After the {{distress}} of 1897, Victoria sought {{to reassure the}} Munshi. [...] "I have in my Testamentary arrangements secured your comfort," [...] she wrote to him, [...] "and have constantly thought of you well. The long letter I enclose which was written nearly a month ago is entirely and solely my own idea, not a human being <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know</b> of it or what you answer me. If you can't read it I will help you and then burn it at once." [...] She told Reid the squabbles placed her and the Munshi under strain, which he replied was unlikely in the latter's case [...] "judging from his robust appearance and undiminished stoutness". Lord Salisbury told Reid he thought it unlikely in her case too, and that she secretly enjoyed the arguments because they were [...] "the only form of excitement she can have".|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, he was {{accepted}} {{as a member of}} the Athenaeum, a gentlemen's club in London's Pall Mall, after being proposed by Cardinal Basil Hume. He met Prince Charles through mutual charity interests, and Charles reportedly sent him gifts on his 80th birthday and a note reading: [...] "Nobody <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know</b> what you have done for this country, Jimmy. This is to go some way in thanking you for that." ...|$|E
2500|$|For many years, Beban was typecast as a French {{character}} actor. Beban later recalled, [...] "No one <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know</b> what {{an awful}} time I {{had to get}} away from French character. I had to live, and for French character parts I could name my own salary, but for anything else I wasn’t worth as much as a chorus man." [...] No longer wishing to play parts that cast him as [...] "a Sunday comic supplement," [...] Beban begged to be given serious parts where he could portray a more rounded human being.|$|E

2500|$|Campese further {{records in}} his {{autobiography}} that following the Test not one Australian player spoke to him or offered him any consolatory remarks. Only Australian coach Bob Dwyer approached Campese following the Test and said, 'Mate, forget it. It's one of those things.' Campese writes that, [...] "No one <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know</b> how much that meant to me then." [...] In Blindsided Michael Lynagh recalls that during the after-match reception the Lions began to buy Campese champagne. Campese left the after-match reception after [...] "20 minutes or so" [...] and drove home. While {{on his way home}} a police officer booked him for speeding at 104 kmh in a 60 kmh zone.|$|E
2500|$|Horne {{was widely}} admired as an {{exceptional}} administrator. [...] "I don't {{believe that the}} country <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know</b> the full contribution to the prosecution of the recent war by this quiet, modest, sincere, but tremendously effective and capable naval officer", said New York Congressman W. Sterling Cole. Truman Committee staffer John J. Tolan marveled, [...] "In an entire lifetime, one is extremely fortunate to watch such men at work." [...] Tolan once asked Horne why he {{spent so much time}} drawing and redrawing boxes in organizational charts. Horne replied, [...] "It isn't the drawing of the boxes that takes my time. It is the selection of the names that go in the boxes. Sometimes, in order to use the right man to his full capacity, you have to change the boxes." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Very {{few people}} {{took the time}} to {{research}} the details of the case or even consult with experts who deal with such news on a daily basis. In fact it was almost a week later that we began to read more accurate accounts of why the teens were executed from international human rights groups including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission – all of whom have contacts in Iran and ways to confirm news of such incidents from independent sources. While no one <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know</b> why these two young men were executed in Iran, what remains clear is that the hysteria surrounding the executions was enormous and only fed to the growing Islamaphobia and hatred towards Muslims and the Islamic world." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{cause of}} the {{accident}} was not established, but the extra passenger and weather at take off did {{not contribute to the}} crash. It was assumed that the pilot was trying to keep in eye contact with the ground in the poor visibility. Verdicts of accidental death were returned for the sixteen victims at the coroner's inquest held at Berkhamsted. The sole survivor, P/O P.D. Cliff, said at the inquest he could not remember anything after boarding the aircraft at Bovingdon. The coroner said that before the aircraft departed [...] "certain things were not done which should have been done. But the question of taking off was entirely a matter for the pilot to decide." [...] "For some reason height was lost – no one knows why, no one <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> <b>know.</b> That caused the unfortunate crash. There was nothing wrong with the engines." ...|$|E

Timucuan cala meant [...] "to cut or shave", [...] "to freeze to death", or [...] "fruit".|$|R
50|$|There is even {{a theory}} that Marlowe's death was faked to save him from trial and {{execution}} for subversive atheism. However, since there are only written documents {{on which to base}} any conclusions, and since it is probable that the most crucial information about his death was never committed to writing at all, {{it is unlikely that the}} full circumstances of Marlowe's death <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> be <b>known.</b>|$|R
5000|$|This wordlist, {{taken from}} the {{appendix}} to Wilson 1970, is based on Akol's memories (and thus is considered by Wilson as belonging to the [...] "Turkwell dialect").

50|$|After much {{research}} was done, {{an inventory of}} the Collection Boulliau was prepared and a chronological calendar of his complete correspondence emerged. Although {{it is difficult to}} prove, evidence suggests that thousands of Boulliau manuscripts are lost. It is not likely that the precise content or arrangement of the original archive <b>will</b> <b>ever</b> be <b>known</b> due to the dispersal of Boulliau's library around the time of his death. His last known testament dated August 20, 1691, displays no mention of his manuscripts.|$|R
