40|$|The Web Services need {{to extend}} beyond the basic service {{architecture}} (invoke and respond) to selfcoordinating Web processes collaborating among themselves in the desired configuration as per user's application (transient to long lasting). A core set of artifacts are needed to allow these Web processes to hook together in a desired structure to enforce automatic information flow, group constraint satisfaction, and data and control dependencies, all without any central coordinating authority. We propose <b>Web</b> Coordination <b>Bonds,</b> analogous to the chemical bonds, {{as a set of}} such core artifacts for effective collaboration among Web Services. There are two types of <b>Web</b> bonds: subscription <b>bonds</b> allow information, control and event flows whereas negotiation bonds enforce dependencies and contracts. <b>Web</b> <b>bonds</b> are simple yet powerful, and we demonstrate how they can be employed to create (model) and enforce (deploy and execute) producerconsumer and shared-resource relationships, workflow scenarios, and atomic transactions. We have developed and prototyped a middleware called System on Devices (SyD) incorporating <b>Web</b> <b>bonds,</b> and have employed it to prototype a few distributed applications which <b>bond</b> existing <b>Web</b> Services together to collaborate.

Web services are self-contained, platform independent functionality which is available over the internet.

With the advent of Service-Oriented Architecture and need for more complex application, it became eminent to have a way in which these independent entities could collaborate in a coherent manner to provide a high level functionality. But the problem of service composition is not an easy one. One reason being the self-contained and loosely coupled interaction style, which happens to be the single most important reason for its popularity. We are proposing a prototype system for distributed coordination of web services. This system is based on the <b>Web</b> <b>Bonds</b> model for coordination.

40|$|Nonwoven fabrics are web {{structures}} of randomly-oriented fibres, bonded {{by means of}} mechanical, thermal or chemical techniques. This paper focuses on nonwovens manufactured with polymer-based fibres and bonded thermally. During thermal bonding of such fibres, as a hot calender with an engraved pattern contacts the fibre <b>web,</b> <b>bond</b> spots are formed by melting of the polymer material. As {{a result of this}} bonding process, a pattern of bond points connected with randomly oriented polymer-based fibres form the nonwoven web. Due to their manufacturing-induced composite microstructure and random orientation of fibres, nonwovens demonstrate a complex mechanical behaviour. Two distinct modelling approaches were introduced to simulate the non-trivial mechanical response of thermally bonded nonwovens based on their planar density. The first modelling approach was developed to simulate the mechanical behaviour of high-density nonwovens, and the respective fabric was modelled with shell elements with thicknesses identical to those of the bond points and the fibre matrix having distinct anisotropic mechanical properties. Random orientation of individual fibres was introduced into the model in terms of the orientation distribution function {{in order to determine the}} material’s anisotropy.

Independently developed applications {{will have to be}} integrated seamlessly despite their heterogeneous origins. Heterogeneity stems from programming languages, development environments, operating systems, and host devices. It can be addressed by providing means of composing (or reusing) existing application functionalities in the form of Web services. This works toward the goal of developing new Web applications and processes with limited programming effort.

The properties of this distribution contain important cosmological information used to study the nature of dark matter, dark energy, and the laws of gravity (DES Collaboration 2017; Hildebrandt et al. 2017; Joudaki et al. 2017), as different cosmological models give rise to dark matter distributions with different properties. Simulations of these cosmic structures (Springel 2005; Potter et al. 2017) play a fundamental role in understanding cosmological measurements (Fosalba et al. 2015; Busha et al. 2013). These simulations are commonly computed using N-body techniques, which represent the matter distribution as a set of particles that evolve throughout cosmic time according to the underlying cosmological model and the laws of gravity. Creating a single N-body simulation requires the use of large computational resources for a long period of time such as days or weeks (Teyssier et al. 2009; Boylan-Kolchin et al. 2009). Furthermore, reliable measurements of cosmological parameters typically require a large number of simulations of various cosmological models (Harnois-Déraps and van Waerbeke 2015; Kacprzak et al. 2016). This creates a strong need for fast, approximate approaches for generating simulations of cosmic web (Heitmann et al. 2010 a; Heitmann et al. 2009 b; Lawrence et al. 2010; Lin and Kilbinger 2015; Howlett et al. 2015).|$|R

In contrast to composites and woven fabrics, nonwoven materials have a unique web structure, which is composed of randomly oriented fibres bonded in a pattern by mechanical, thermal or chemical techniques. The type of nonwovens studied in this research is a thermally bonded one with polymer-based bicomponent fibres. Such fibres have a core/sheath structure with outer layer (sheath) having a lower melting temperature {{than that of the}} core. In thermal bonding of such fibres, as the hot calender with an engraved pattern contacts the fibrous <b>web,</b> <b>bond</b> points are formed thanks to melting of the sheath material. Molten sheath material acts as an adhesive while core parts of the fibres remain fully intact in the bond points. On the other hand, web regions, which are not in contact with the hot engraved pattern, remain unaffected and form the fibre matrix that acts as a link between bond points. With two distinct regions, namely, bond points and fibre matrix, with different structures, nonwovens exhibit a unique deformation behaviour. This research aims to analyse the complex mechanical behaviour of thermally bonded bicomponent fibre nonwoven materials using a combination of experimental and numerical methods. A novel approach is introduced in the thesis to predict the complex mechanical behaviour of thermally bonded bicomponent fibre nonwovens under various threedimensional time-dependent loading conditions. Development of the approach starts with experimental studies on thermally bonded bicomponent fibre nonwovens to achieve a better understating of their complex deformation characteristics. Mechanical performance of single bicomponent fibres is investigated with tensile and relaxation tests since they are the basic constituents of nonwoven fabrics. The fabric microstructure, {{which is one of the}} most important factors affecting its mechanical behaviour, is examined with scanning electron microscopy and X-ray micro computed tomography techniques.

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Philosophy)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. The central {{purpose of}} this study is the {{integration}} of modem philosophical thinking with different chaos theory principles and definitions to form relational perspectives. Relations are used in different contexts to base the causes of deterministic chaos (chaost) in the laws of nature which constitutes order. The chaost-attractor is used as subjective conception to investigate the possibilities of hidden order in a seemingly chaotic state of the objective reality. Relevant definitions of the chaos theory were analysed methodically and transcendentally with the aid of concepts of order and relations. Attention is given to the broad associations and analogies from philosophy and other disciplines which relate to the connectivity of objects to form systems. Subjective model development was done which is used to consequentially analyse some statements from published research which applied principles of chaost. It is argued that: the intrinsic properties of objects determine the causality of forces which bind objects to compose systems; a <b>web</b> of interactive <b>bonds</b> functions subjective to laws of nature which determine whether a system is in a state of order, chaost or real chaos; a dynamical transfer of many intrinsic and asymmetric properties via internal bonds constitutes non-linear connectivity which causes a sensitivity for initial conditions. It is found that the chaost of the chaos theory is not the same as real, objective chaos. The random-like evolution of a dynamic system is determined by the occurrence of irregularities and uncertainties in its internal order. A <b>web</b> of interactive <b>bonds</b> distribute small changes self-similar and scale-relevant.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} Fibre Cement Felts (FCF), which is a non-woven textile substrate acting as a conveyor belt for the manufacturing of Fibre Cement Sheets (FCS). Fibre Cement Felts are a valued component required in the manufacturing process of Fibre Cement Sheets, used in construction for today’s building industry. Identifying the key factors that most influence FCF will assist in {{understanding of the relationship}} between fibre diameters, carded <b>web,</b> and mechanical <b>bonding.</b> As these factors {{have an effect on the}} performance requirements and characteristics of FCF, this will ultimately impact the production of Fibre Cement Products. The main purpose of this research was to investigate the influence fibres types and parameters selected for manufacturing FCF. In addition the effects of the needling sequence, and the influence of these parameters on the final physical and performance characteristics of FCF. This research recognised that the mechanical properties of the fibre, and the manufacturing methods used both have an effect on the physical parameters and performance attributes of a FCF. These factors affect the performance requirements and characteristics of FCF for the end application for the production of FCS on a Fibre Cement Machine...|$|R
40|$|The {{universe}} is permeated by {{a network of}} filaments, sheets, and knots collectively forming a “cosmic web. ” The discovery of the cosmic web, especially through its signature of absorption of light from distant sources by neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium, exemplifies the interplay between theory and experiment that drives science, {{and is one of}} the great examples in which numerical simulations have played a key and decisive role. We recount the milestones in our understanding of cosmic structure, summarize its impact on astronomy, cosmology, and physics, and look ahead by outlining the challenges faced as we prepare to probe the cosmic web at new wavelengths. Cosmologists envision a universe made up of filaments, knots, and sheets reminiscent of pancakes (1), dubbed the “cosmic <b>web</b> ” by <b>Bond</b> and collaborators (2). This picture of the cosmos – now well entrenched even in popular culture – is, however, much more than mere fantasy. Indeed, it is one of the best-established results of cosmological research and underpins much of our contemporary understanding of large-scale structure and galaxy formation. After Schmidt’s spectroscopic observations of a distant quasar (a fantastically bright poin...|$|R
40|$|Acoustical {{insulation}} and absorption properties of nonwoven fabrics depend on fiber geometry and fiber arrangement within the fabric structure. The {{different structures of}} the fibers result in different total surface areas of nonwoven fabrics. Nonwoven fabrics such as vertically lapped fabrics are ideal materials for use as acoustical insulation products, because they have high total surface. Vertically lapped nonwoven technology consists of carding, perpendicular layering of the carded <b>webs,</b> and through-air <b>bonding</b> using synthetic binder fibers. The surface area of the fabric {{is directly related to}} the denier and cross-sectional shape of the fibers in the fabric. Smaller deniers yield more fibers per unit weight of the material, higher total fiber surface area, and greater possibilities for a sound wave to interact with the fibers in the fabric structure. The research in the literature uses two methods for measuring acoustical properties of fabric materials: the impedance tube and reverberation room method. Small test samples are in the impedance tube method and sound absorption coefficient is determined at each frequency. Large reverberation rooms and large test samples are used for the reverberation room method. A direct comparative acoustical properties measurement device that was designed and fabricated at Clemson University School of Materials Science & Engineering was used to measure acoustical insulation in this research. This paper provides a description of the measurement devices and acoustical measurement data for vertically lapped nonwoven fabrics made from three different polyester fiber shape and two denier levels...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Nonwoven-fabrics have been in use since 1930 s. Their advantages over other web fonnation methods like knitting and weaving have attracted many industries such as aerospace, automotive, sports, geotextiles, composites, battery separators etc. to explore and increase their usage. During nonwoven manufacturing, most of the laid loose webs have an insufficient strength as fonned, and require an additional bonding procedure {{in order to provide}} the produced nonwoven with its intended properties. To achieve the desired properties of the nonwoven <b>web,</b> the <b>bonding</b> process is therefore, the most important part during production. The thennal bonding through air is one of the modem techniques which is incrementally improved to increase the yield of manufactured nonwoven properties. The system has a disadvantage which is, that the production capacity and energy efficiency is very low. The entitled research aims an industrial optimisation of the thermal bonding through air by entailing a strategic approach and encompassing the whole process chain of the thennal bonding process. The comprehensive and flexible optimisation opportunities provided by the CFD has been used to aid in the control and optimisation of the thermal bonding process and machinery. To optimise the process and product quality, the complex system composing of several components and various physical phenomena occurring during processing is simulated using a hierarchical methodology. More specifically a hierarchical decomposition procedure to recast the original multi scale problem as a sequence of three scale decoupled macro-, meso-, and micro scale subproblems is exploited. The methodology is applied in conjunction with the validation of experiments on through-air bonding product lines. 2 D and 3 D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models based on the continuum modelling approach and the theory of porous media coupled with the theory of mixtures are developed to treat the flow behavior, heat transfer, phase change and air moisture transport within the whole through-air bonding system. The model is concluded to be an economic computational tool hence providing rapid process optimisation and valuable infonnation early in the process, which can replace costly experiments and ensure product consistency under variable process and climate conditions. 2 D and 3 D hybrid modelling considering parametric discrete and continuum parts is also perfonned using conjugate heat transfer analyses. The approach precisely permits the optimisation of the machine component design and the associated optimisation of consistent process and product properties...|$|R
