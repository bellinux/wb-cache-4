5|$|However, by {{the turn}} of the 20th century, the {{quarries}} slowly fell into disuse and by the 1960s all of the remaining industrial areas had closed and the quarries infilled, though the sandstone properties at St Alban's Place and Co-Operative Terrace stand as a reminder to <b>Windy</b> Nook's industrial history. The decrease in employment opportunities led to a steady decline in population and although some housing developed along Stone Street and Coldwell Lane, the urban sprawl that enveloped most of the outlying settlements of Gateshead during the early 20th century never reached <b>Windy</b> Nook, so that in 1945 it remained largely unchanged in location and size. Despite some terraced housing being built in at Crossfield Park and Coltsfoot Gardens in the 197080's, the character of the suburb today remains suburban; the land is split 50/50 between residential properties and open green space and only 11.3% of the residential properties today are council housing. The result is that <b>Windy</b> Nook is a high-demand area for privately owned and social housing.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Hopper {{was a local}} {{councillor}} and Methodist preacher {{who lived}} in <b>Windy</b> Nook and was {{the creator of the}} 'aged mineworkers home scheme' in 1898 which provided housing for miners who had retired and were no longer eligible for tenure by dint of their employment. The organisation he created, the , is today a registered charity which owns around 1,500 properties and had a turnover in 2012 of over six million pounds. A celebration of Hopper's work was produced after his death by John Oxberry, who was himself born in <b>Windy</b> Nook, in 1924. Oxberry, born in 1857, was a renowned local historian who traveled to New Zealand but returned to publish various texts, including <b>Windy</b> Nook Village; its inhabitants and their Co-operative store, and served a variety of roles on Gateshead Council with sufficient distinction that he was made a Freeman of Gateshead in 1937. Oxberry died three years later.|$|E

5|$|The {{decline of}} heavy {{industry}} in the 20th century left <b>Windy</b> Nook with no major employer and there was little {{in terms of economic}} activity. There is no major commercial area and residents usually travel to neighbouring Felling town centre to shop or use the small shopping area at the junction of <b>Windy</b> Nook Road and Carr Hill Road/Albion Street. However, in November 2011, planning permission was approved for conversion of the Black House Inn at the junction of Carr Hill Road and Coldwell lane into a 'Tesco Extra' store. The approval was granted in spite of complaints and concerns as to noise and traffic being raised by local residents. This store is now the largest employer in <b>Windy</b> Nook, employing around 20 staff.|$|E

25|$|In 1951–1952 the <b>Windies</b> visited Australia. The first Test saw {{a narrow}} defeat by three wickets, {{with the two}} spinners {{seemingly}} continuing their form with twelve wickets between them. The second Test was lost by seven wickets, as Australia replied to the <b>Windies</b> 362 and 290 with 567 (which included centuries from Lindsay Hassett and Keith Miller) and 137 for 2. 6 wickets from Worrell in the third Test saw Australia dismissed for only 82, and the <b>Windies</b> eventually won by six wickets to pull back to two-one down in the series. The fourth Test saw the series lost in a narrow defeat. Worrell, batting with an injured hand, scored 108 and helped the <b>Windies</b> to 272 before Australia made 216 in reply. 203 from the <b>Windies</b> left Australia a target of 260. 5 wickets from Valentine helped reduced the Aussies to 222 for 9, 38 short with 1 wicket remaining. It didn't happen, as some brilliant running between the wicket for Australia by Bill Johnston and Doug Ring saw West Indies lose their composure and the match. The fifth Test saw three batting collapses, as Australia (116 and 377) beat <b>Windies</b> (78 and 213) by 202 runs to finish the rubber four-one winners. The West Indies {{then went on to}} New Zealand. In the first Test encounter between the two teams, the visitors scored a five wicket victory. In the second and final Test, Allan Rae scored 99, Jeffrey Stollmeyer 152, Frank Worrell 100 and Clyde Walcott 115 as the West Indies put on 546 for 6 declared. There wasn't enough time to bowl out the opposition twice though, as the hosts made 160 and were following-on at 17 for 1 when stumps were drawn, leaving the <b>Windies</b> series winners.|$|R
