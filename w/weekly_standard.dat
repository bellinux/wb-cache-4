5|$|Boot {{wrote for}} the CFR through 2010 and 2011 for various {{publications}} such as Newsweek, The Boston Globe, The New York Times, and The <b>Weekly</b> <b>Standard</b> among others. He particularly argued that President Obama's health care plans made maintaining the U.S.' superpower status harder, that withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq occurred prematurely while making another war there more likely, and that the initial U.S. victory in Afghanistan had been undone by government complacency though forces could still pull off a victory. He also wrote op-eds criticizing planned budget austerity measures in both the U.S. and the U.K. as hurting their national security interests.|$|E

Still dont.

5000|$|Notwithstanding the <b>Weekly</b> <b>Standards</b> {{strong support}} for Sarah Palin, moreover, Labash mocked her in a 2010 piece about her reality TV show, noting that despite her {{assertion}} that she loves “like I love my family,” Palin “didn’t give her family up after governing it for two-and-a-half years, {{so that she could}} get a Fox News contract, and make 100 grand per speech, and write two books in a year, and drag her entire family onto a tacky reality show.” He added: “one could see how Karl Rove... has a point when suggesting that the American people might expect a certain level of gravitas in someone who’s considering running for president, and that starring in your own reality show might not be the ticket.” ...|$|R

40|$|L ongitudinal {{studies have}} shown that {{morbidity}} and mortality are high in peritoneal dialysis (PD) when the dose of PD, measured either as fractional urea clearance (KtN) or creatinine clearance (CCr), is low (1 - 4). Consequently, minimal levels ofKt/V and CCr for "adequate " PD have been suggested. These minimal levels have increased over the years. Earlier, <b>weekly</b> <b>standards</b> were set at 1. 7 for KtN and 50 L/l. 73 m 2 for CCr (5). Recent guidelines have set higher standards: 2. 0 weekly for KtN and 60 L/l. 73 m 2 weekly for CCr in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) (6, 7); higher standards were suggested in continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) and in nightly intermittent peritoneal dialysis (NIPD) (7).

25|$|An {{article in}} the <b>Weekly</b> <b>Standard,</b> an American {{conservative}} opinion magazine, questioned the cost-effectiveness of Habitat building projects. To estimate cost effectiveness, all costs associated with building a Habitat home must be used, including the cost of volunteer time and training. For houses constructed by foreign volunteers, travel and associated costs paid by the volunteers are also significant. Including these costs raises the question whether building a house this way is an efficient use of resources. Particularly in developing countries where labor is relatively inexpensive, unemployment is high, and local currency is cheap, purchasing local labor and supplies may result {{in an increase in}} the number of houses built.|$|E

25|$|In {{what some}} have speculated {{was an attempt}} at damage control {{just days after the}} interview, Barbour {{suspended}} the prison sentences of Jamie and Gladys Scott, two African American women who received life sentences resulting from a 1993 mugging in which the two women stole $11. Barbour has denied that there was any connection between the suspension of the Scott sisters' prison sentence and the controversy surrounding his <b>Weekly</b> <b>Standard</b> interview. Jamie Scott suffered from kidney failure while in prison, and requires a donated organ, which her sister Gladys had volunteered to provide. Barbour's decision to release the Scott sisters, however, is contingent upon the promised organ donation by Gladys Scott, which critics argued amounted to coercion and raises questions of medical ethics.|$|E

But the piece went on to note that other Republican celebrities had been able to make the transition to elected politician (Schwarzenegger, Ronald Reagan, Sonny Bono), because they [...] "embodied optimism". Miller, the Standard proclaimed, was seen in contrast as [...] "both terribly erudite...and decidedly yuppie (the comedian endorses DirecTV and Amstel Light, not his namesake brew). Not to mention a little too edgy for some Republicans." [...] The Standard noted that he had been booed by some in the Republican audience during his Los Angeles fund-raiser for President Bush when he said Democratic [...] "West Virginia senator Robert Byrd 'must be burning the cross at both ends'." [...] Miller had responded [...] "'Well, he was in the Klan. Boo me, but he was in the Klan.'" [...] The Standard said [...] "he'd be an HBO politician trying to play to a T.G.I.
