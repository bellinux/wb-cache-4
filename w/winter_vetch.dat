Black oat (Avena strigosa) and hairy <b>vetch</b> (Vicia villosa) <b>winter</b> cover crops were planted for 2 years as part of a sustainable production system for cotton in the Lower Rio Grande Valley of Texas, and were till-killed each spring prior to cotton planting. Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri), common purslane (Portulaca oler-acea), and sunflower (Helianthus annuus) were frequently-encountered winter and spring weeds. Both cover crops controlled winter weeds as well as did winter tillage without cover. Black oats plots had 8 % and 17 % more total winter weed cover than no-cover and hairy vetch plots, respectively.

The first factor was cover crops (consisting of <b>winter</b> rye, hairy <b>vetch,</b> berseem clover, with and without weeding) as controls. The second factor was two levels of split application of 225 kg. ha- 1 urea at two growth stages forage corn: the first level (N 1 = 1 / 2  at planting and 1 / 2  at 8 - 10 leaf stage), second level (N 2 = 1 / 3  at planting, 1 / 3  at 8 - 10 leaf and 1 / 3  one week before tasselling stage). The third factor consisted of two levels of weed control: weeding at 8 leaves and weeding one week before tasselling. Results showed that <b>winter</b> rye, hairy <b>vetch</b> and berseem clover cover crops decreased total weed dry weights up to 87, 82 and 65 % respectively as compared to control (without weeding).

40|$|Changes in the {{accumulation}} of two types of α-D-galactosides: raffinose family oligosaccharides and galactosyl pinitols were compared with changes {{in the activities of}} galactosyltransferases during <b>winter</b> <b>vetch</b> (Vicia villosa Roth.) seed development and maturation. Occurrence of galactinol and raffinose in young seeds and changes in activities of galactinol synthase and raffinose synthase during seed development indicated that formation of raffinose oligosaccharides (RFOs) preceded synthesis of galactopinitols. Although transfer of galactose residues into raffinose oligosaccharides increased as seeds were maturing, at late stages of seed maturation {{the accumulation}} of galactopinitols was preferred to that of RFOs. In the present study, activities of enzymes transferring galactose moieties from galactinol to D-pinitol forming galactopinitol A, and further transfer of galactose moieties from galactinol to mono- and di-galactopinitol A were detected throughout seed development and maturation. This is a new observation, indicating biological potential of <b>winter</b> <b>vetch</b> seeds to synthesize mono-, di- and tri-galactosides of D-pinitol in a pathway similar to RFOs. The pattern of changes in activities of stachyose synthase and enzymes synthesizing galactopinitols (named galactopinitol A synthase and ciceritol synthase) suggests that formation of stachyose, mono- and di-galactopinitol A (ciceritol) is catalyzed by one enzyme. High correlation between activities of verbascose synthase and enzyme catalyzing synthesis of tri-galactopinitol A from galactinol and ciceritol (named tri-galactopinitol A synthase) also suggests that biosynthesis of both types of tri-galactosides was catalyzed by one enzyme, but distinct from stachyose synthase. Changes in concentrations of galactosyl acceptors (sucrose and D-pinitol) can be a factor which regulates splitting of galactose moieties between both types of galactosides in <b>winter</b> <b>vetch</b> seeds...|$|E

The two components of mixtures were sown 50 % each. A four-replicate {{randomised complete block design}} was used with 50 m 2 plots. The results were compared to the mixtures of spring oats and vetch; and spring oats and pea, respectively. The green matter of fall sown crops was cut by scythe late May, whereas that of spring crops early June. Data demonstrate that the green forage yield and protein production of fall sown oats as a monocrop and intercropped with vetch was higher than those of spring types. Green matter and dry matter yield varied with season, and were more advantageous in the year 2004, when there was more precipitation. The crude protein content of <b>winter</b> <b>vetch</b> and the crude protein production of the mixture fall sown oats + <b>winter</b> <b>vetch</b> were the highest.

40|$|Introduction Amount and {{vertical}} distribution of leaf area {{are essential for}} estimating interception and utilization of solar radiation of crop canopies and, consequently dry matter accumulation (Valentinuz & Tollenaar, 2006). Vertical distribution of leaf area is leaf areas per horizontal layers, based on height (Boedhram et al., 2001). Above-ground biomass {{is one of the}} central traits in functional plant ecology and growth analysis. It is a key parameter in many allometric relationships (Niklas & Enquist, 2002). The vertical biomass distribution is considered to be the main determinant of competitive strength in plant species. The presence of weeds intensifies competition for light, with the effect being determined by plant height, position of the branches, and location of the maximum leaf area. So, this experiment was conducted to study the vertical distribution of leaf area and dry matter of soybean canopy in competition with weeds and cover crops. Materials and methods This experiment was performed based on complete randomized block design with 3 replications in center of Agriculture of Joybar in 2013. Soybean was considered as main crop and soybean and Persian clover (Trifolium resupinatum L.), fenugreek (Trigonella foenum–graecum L.), chickling pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) and <b>winter</b> <b>vetch</b> (Vicia sativa L.) were the cover crops. Treatments were included cover crops (Persian clover, fenugreek, chickling pea and <b>winter</b> <b>vetch)</b> aDid you mean: nd cover crop planting times (simultaneous planting of soybean with cover crops and planting cover crops three weeks after planting of soybeans) and also monoculture of soybeans both in weedy and weed free conditions were considered as controls. Soybean planted in 50 cm row spacing with 5 cm between plants in the same row. Each plot was included 5 rows soybeans. Cover crop inter-seeded simultaneously in the main crop. Crops were planted on 19 May 2013 for simultaneous planting of soybean. The dominant weed species were green foxtail (Setaria viridis L.), foxtail grass (Alopecurus myosuroides Huds), and red root pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.) in the experimental field. The other weed was considered as the others. At the soybean canopy closure stage, a vertical card board frame marked in 20 -cm increments was used in the field as a guide to cut standing plants including soybean, cover crops and weeds. In each vertical layer of canopy, leaves and stem samples were separated. The leaf area both crops and weeds were measured with a leaf area meter LICOR- 3000 A (LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). Stem and leaf samples oven dried. Results and discussion The results showed that the maximum leaf area and dry matter of soybean was varied in different layers of canopy {{depending on the type of}} cover crop and cover crop planting time, while delaying in planting of cover crop causes lower leaf area and dry matter than the plants were planted at the same time with soybean. In most cases, the maximum leaf area index and dry matter accumulation of weeds were obtained in primary layer (0 - 20 cm). The maximum weed leaf area (290. 4 cm 2) was observed in simultaneous planting of soybean with fenugreek and maximum of total weed dry matter (12. 4 g. plant- 1) was observed in soybean without weeding, while the minimum of weed total leaf area and total weed dry matter (0 cm 2 and 0 g. plant- 1, respectively) was achieved in planting of <b>winter</b> <b>vetch</b> after 21 days of soybean planting. Also delayed planting of <b>winter</b> <b>vetch</b> produced the maximum grain yield (3792. 6 kg. ha- 1) of soybean in weedy plots, where it had the greatest weed suppressive ability than other cover crops. Conclusion <b>Winter</b> <b>vetch</b> can suppress weed with competition and allelopathic mechanism, so we can conclude that <b>winter</b> <b>vetch</b> planting 21 days after soybean planting is suitable replacement for weed suppression in sustainable agriculture...|$|E

Winter annual cover crops, winter rye (Secale cereale) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa roth.), can reduce weed density and build soil health in organic production systems. There is considerable interest in integrating cover crops and reduced tillage with organic vegetable production; but {{few studies have}} been conducted in regions with short growing seasons and cool soils such as the upper Midwest. We evaluated no-tillage production of tomato, zucchini, cauliflower, and bell pepper planted into <b>winter</b> rye, hairy <b>vetch,</b> and a <b>winter</b> rye-hairy <b>vetch</b> mixture that were mechanically suppressed with a roller-crimper at two locations in Minnesota. Average marketable yields of tomato, zucchini, and bell pepper in the cover crops were reduced 58 - 87 %, 27 - 75 % and 62 - 92 %, respectively, compared to a no-cover control. Winter rye and the mixture reduced average annual weed density at St. Paul by 96 % for 8 - 10 weeks after rolling (WAR) and hairy vetch mulch had 80 % control for 2 - 8 WAR; while at Lamberton, there was no consistent effect of cover treatments on weed populations. Winter rye and the mixture had higher average residue biomass (5. 3 and 5. 7 Mgha- 1) than hairy vetch (3. 0 Mgha- 1) throughout the season in addition to higher biomass N content in most cases. Cover crop mulches reduced soil temperature by 2. 9 ° to 5. 7 ° C compared to a no-cover control for 4 - 5 weeks after planting which delayed vegetable growth and could have contributed to reduced yields in the cover crop mulches. In addition, low levels of soil N (< 10 mg N•kg- 1) in the top 15 cm under all cover crop mulches likely resulted in nutrient deficiency symptoms and reduced vegetable yields. Rolled winter annual cover crops show promise for controlling annual weeds in organic no-tillage systems, but {{there is a need to}} reduce the impact of the rolled cover crops on the yield of organic vegetables in the upper Midwest...|$|R
40|$|Beside RFOs, {{which are}} {{commonly}} present in legume seeds, seeds of some species contain galactosyl pinitols (GPs). These carbohydrates, like RFOs, have been hypothesized to constitute an important energy and carbon skeletal source during germination. To test this hypothesis we have applied a specific α-galactosidase inhibitor (1 -deoxygalactonojirimycin, DGJ) to germinating <b>winter</b> <b>vetch</b> (Vicia villosa Roth.) seeds, containing more galactosyl pinitols than RFOs. The breakdown of RFOs {{but not that}} of GPs was completely blocked in both embryonic axes and cotyledons tissues, during the first 18 h of imbibition in DGJ. The inhibitor only decreased the rate of GPs degradation. The inhibitory effect of DGJ on GPs degradation was partially alleviated by addition of sucrose or galactose to DGJ solutions. After three days of germination in water, RFOs and GPs disappeared in axial tissues of seeds imbibed in water, galactose or sucrose. Eighteen-hour imbibition of seeds in DGJ drastically reduced germination, by ca 50 %, {{during the first three}} days. The inhibitory effect of DGJ decreased during the next seven days of germination. The presence of galactose or sucrose in imbibition solution initially stimulated seed germination, but later this effect was not statistically significant. Our study provides clear evidence that galactosyl pinitols {{play an important role in}} early <b>winter</b> <b>vetch</b> seeds germination.

Vicia sativa (common vetch), Brassica oleracea var. italica (broccoli), Vicia faba ‘Sevilla’ (faba bean) and fallow are tested as preceding (winter) crops. During the experiment carried out between 2007 and 2009, the main crops were tomato (2007), zucchini (2008) and pepper (2009). Broccoli represented the farmers’ choice as a <b>winter</b> vegetable. <b>Vetch</b> (incorporated) and faba bean (partially harvested and incorporated) were selected as legumes well adapted to the regional conditions.

During the production seasons, all variable costs and revenue, during both the pre-crop and main crop cycles, were recorded and gross margin calculated for each treatment. Economic analysis showed that broccoli as a pre-crop required the highest variable costs followed by faba bean, vetch and fallow, in all three years. Total revenue was the highest in plots where broccoli was the pre-crop. It is followed by faba bean plots mostly because higher yields were obtained in main crop plots following faba bean. The least profitable was fallow – main crop rotation.

40|$|Agriculture has {{transformed}} {{over the past}} centuries dramatically to become highly dependent on non-renewable fossil fuels, synthetic fertilizers and plant protection agents. This often occurs {{at the cost of}} soil degradation and soil food web disturbance. Future agriculture must not only be productive but also provide ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration, pest and disease suppression, nutrient cycling and water storage to become sustainable in the long-term. Sustainability is especially fostered by reduced tillage and the presence of a permanent layer of plant residues. Under such conditions, soil compaction is reduced, soil structure improved, water infiltration enhanced, soil organic content increased and microbial activity stimulated. However, continuous soil cover, especially associated with permanent growth of plants, might also enhance plant-parasitic nematode densities due to permanent food supply. The effect of minimum tillage on nematode dynamics was studied within the EU-funded project “Optimizing subsidiary crop applications in rotations”. The rotation consisted of clover-grass, winter wheat, cover crop, and potato. The following treatments were studied: Plough versus minimum tillage, white clover versus subterranean clover as undersown crops in <b>winter</b> wheat, <b>vetch</b> versus a 1 : 4 mix of fodder radish and black oats as cover crop following winter wheat, and with and without 5 t DM ha- 1 compost application. Initially, the field was infested with Helicotylenchus, Meloidogyne, Paratylenchus, Pratylenchus and Tylenchorhynchus. Pratylenchus and Helicotylenchus increased under wheat and Meloidogyne was supported by white clover and subterranean clover as undersown crops.

Non-cytolytic T-cell lines generally have low activity, whereas most cytotoxic lines have high levels of activity. However, one cytotoxic T-cell line does not express the enzyme, although it has large numbers of VV-binding sites. This suggests the existence of another type of VV-binding sites which is independent of the beta 1, 4 -GalNActransferase in some cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte lines. The enzyme was also assayed in a variety of other tissues and found to have a very high activity in the intestine but a low activity in most other tissues.

However, changes to present cropping methods and systems {{are required to}} obtain such advantages (Hauggaard-Nielsen et al., 2009). Strip intercropping attempts to capture the biological efficiency of intercropping (Willey, 1979) {{in the context of}} more separated crop components and efficient mechanization (Exner et al., 1999). The aim of the study is to test the use of a 6 m annual <b>winter</b> rye-winter <b>vetch</b> intercrop strip adjacent to a 6 m perennial grass-clover mixture. Materials and Methods 2 y field experimentation was conducted under temperate growing conditions in Denmark (55 ° 40 ’N, 12 ° 18 ’E). Results The grass-clover was more competitive towards plant growth factors reducing rye N uptake, but increasing the percentage of total aboveground vetch N accumulation derived from SNF. Equivalent dynamics were identified in the pasture with less clover found 0 - 50 cm away from the annual strip due to strong soil mineral N interspecific competitive interactions between grass and rye, as compared to > 150 cm away. Conclusions Less reliance on non-renewable resources positions legumes in an important role. The present strip intercropping strategy is able to respond to temporal and spatially variable soil mineral N resources securing an efficient uptake with simultaneous SNF whenever soil N is limited. Furthermore, the inclusion of a perennial strip increase soil carbon stocks which should be taking into evaluating overall climate change mitigation.

An evaluation of cover crop species, planting dates, seeding rates, fertilizer rates, and N accumulation aids in providing these BMPs. The first objective {{of this research is}} to assess the effect of planting date on biomass production, as well as looking at the interaction of seeding rate or fertilizer rate for legumes or non-legumes, respectively, using Austrian winter pea (Pisum sativum), cereal rye (Secale cereale), black oats (Avena strigosa), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and tillage radish (Raphanus sativus). Crops were planted on five dates in three locations across the primary crop production regions of Arkansas, using either variable Agrotain-treated urea rates or variable seeding rates. Agrotain is a N fertilizer additive that inhibits urease activity and limits ammonia volatilization loss potential. A 0. 9 x 0. 9 m sample of above-ground biomass was oven-dried and weighed to determine total cover crop biomass production. This research found that earlier planting dates were preferable for all species and that fertilizer or seeding rates did not have much effect on establishment and biomass across all planting dates.

In this 28 -day laboratory incubation study, we examined the carbon (C) and N dynamics and N 2 O evolution after simulated incorporation of residues from three catch crop species into a loamy sand soil, with variable soil moisture (40, 50 or 60 % water-filled pore space (WFPS)). The catch crops include two leguminous (red clover and <b>winter</b> <b>vetch)</b> and one non-leguminous species (ryegrass). Plant material {{was placed in a}} discrete layer surrounded by soil in which the nitrate (NO 3 -) pool was enriched with 15 N to distinguish N 2 O derived from denitrification and nitrification. Net N mineralisation from leguminous catch crops was significant (30 – 48 mg N kg− 1 soil, accounting for 41 – 56 % of the added residue-N), whereas ryegrass incorporation resulted in net N immobilisation. The evolution of N 2 O was probably enhanced by N release from the residues, especially during the second week, which can explain the lower N 2 O evolution after application of ryegrass. Emission of N 2 O occurred at all moisture levels, but was higher at 50 and 60 % WFPS than at 40 % in soil with leguminous residues. The 15 N enrichment of N 2 O indicated that denitrification was the dominant source independent of moisture level and residue type. We conclude that catch crop residues will stimulate N 2 O emissions via denitrification over a wide range of soil moisture conditions, but that emission levels may depend significantly on residue quality and soil moisture...|$|E

A series of field experiments will be conducted over 24 months on an organic site in order to quantitatively assess the fate of N from 2 winter cover crops (rye (Secale cereale) and <b>winter</b> <b>vetch</b> (Vicia sativa)). Mineral N content in soil following incorporation of these winter cover crops will be monitored at weekly or monthly intervals. Studies will be conducted to determine how effectively N mineralised from incorporated winter cover crops is used by subsequent arable and horticultural crops. The cover crops will be followed by sequences of cash crops covering a cropping period of up to 24 months. Cash crop sequences will consist of one of the following: •	a short term summer crop utilising rapidly mineralised N, followed by 2 successive winter cereals •	a series of horticultural crops (including winter crops) maintaining as much ground cover during the year as possible •	short term crops, maintaining ground cover during spring and summer only •	bare soil (control) Nitrate leaching will be assessed in these different crop sequences using ceramic cup samplers. Effects of cultural techniques (especially time of incorporation) on the pattern of N mineralization from incorporated winter cover crops will also be investigated. The existing HRI computer model for N mineralization will be refined and tested using experimental data as it becomes available {{during the course of the}} project. Experimental data and information from computer modelling will be evaluated in the context of current farming advice on the use of winter cover crops and will also help to provide a basis which could aid future government policy development on related farming issues...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Legume-based {{catch crops}} (LBCCs) may {{act as an}} {{important}} source of nitrogen (N) in organic crop rotations because of biological N fixation. However, the potential risk of high nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions needs {{to be taken into account}} when including LBCCs in crop rotations. Here, we report the results from a one-year field experiment, which investigated N availability and N 2 O emissions as affected by three LBCCs, i. e., red clover (CL), red clover–ryegrass mixture (GC) and <b>winter</b> <b>vetch</b> (WV), two non-LBCCs, i. e., perennial ryegrass (GR) and fodder radish (FR), and a control (CO) without catch crops. The effect of two catch crop management strategies was also tested: autumn harvest of the catch crop versus incorporation of whole-crop residues by spring ploughing. LBCCs accumulated 59 – 67 kg N ha− 1 in their tops, significantly more than those of the non-LBCC, 32 – 40 kg N ha− 1. Macro-roots accounted for > 33 % of total N in the catch crops. In accordance with this, LBCCs enhanced the performance of the succeeding unfertilised spring barley, thus obtaining a grain yield of 3. 3 – 4. 5 Mg ha− 1 compared to 2. 6 – 3. 3 Mg ha− 1 grain yield from non-LBCC and the fallow control treatments. Autumn harvest of catch crops, especially LBCCs, tended to reduce crop yield. The annual N 2 O emissions were comparable across treatments except for fodder radish, which had the highest N 2 O emission, and also the highest average yield-scaled N 2 O emission, at 499 g N 2 O-N Mg− 1 grain. Although the sampling strategy employed in this study introduces uncertainty about the spatial and temporal variability, differences in seasonal emission patterns among catch crops were captured and harvest of catch crops in late autumn induced significantly higher emissions during winter, but lower emissions after residue incorporation in spring. In comparison with non-LBCC, LBCCs have the potential to partly replace the effect of manure application in organic cropping systems with greater crop production and less environmental footprint with respect to N 2 O emissions. However, harvest of the catch crops may reduce crop yield unless the harvested N is recycled as fertiliser to the crops in the rotation...|$|E
