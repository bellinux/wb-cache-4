5|$|The VH series Commodore {{introduced}} in September 1981 brought moderately updated frontal bodywork, {{with a new}} bonnet and front guards to facilitate the reshaped headlamps and a horizontally slatted grille. These front-end design changes worked to produce a longer, yet wider look. At the rear, sedans featured redesigned tail light clusters, the design of which borrowed from Mercedes-Benz models of the day, using a louvered design. At the same time, the nomenclature of the range was rationalised. The SL superseded the L as the base model, with the old SL level becoming the mid-range SL/X, and the SL/E remaining as the top-of-the-line variant. Wagons were restricted to the SL and SL/X trims. Redesigned pentagonal alloy wheels—replacing the original SL/E type used since 1978—along with a black painted B-pillar, wrap-around chrome rear bumper extensions to the <b>wheel</b> <b>arches,</b> and extended tail lamps that converged with the license plate alcove—distinguished the range-topping SL/E from other variants. The new pentagonal wheels were initially in short supply, such that only Shadowtone option SL/E sedans received them during 1981 production.|$|E

25|$|The St. Tropez {{conversion}} {{was designed}} by Paul Bailey and his company PBB Design, which was established in 1987. The conversion involved removing the roof and rear bodywork. The <b>wheel</b> <b>arches</b> were also widened and new Compomotive wheels {{were part of the}} package. The A-pillar and the chassis were reinforced with steel, and a steel subframe was added in the rear.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Wheel’s {{contribution}} to vehicle aerodynamic drag is around 25 %. Reducing this amount {{is of great}} interest to diminish fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions. The knowledge of vortex structures around the wheel is therefore necessary to understand the physical mechanisms of vortex dynamics and to develop a strategy for flow control. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and aerodynamic torque measurements have been carried out in a wind tunnel in order to analyze the flow around a rotating wheel located inside a <b>wheel</b> <b>arch.</b> This study has been conducted in collaboration with RENAULT Research Department, Aero Concept Engineering (ACE) and ISAT (Institut Supérieur de l’Automobile et des Transports). Detailed flow-field measurements of a 40 percent full-scale bluff body have been obtained using two-dimensional PIV in the wind tunnel facility of ACE in Magny-Cours, France. Drag coefficient data have also been acquired using balance measurements for several <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> volume parameters. A global increase in drag has been shown with <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> volume growth. Longitudinal vortex structures such as “jetting ” have also been visualized using PIV. Wake characterization for three <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> volumes has been obtained. Flow structure differences between stationary and rotating wheel have also been observed for one <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> volume configuration...|$|R
25|$|The GT-R had a {{significantly}} larger intercooler, larger brakes, and aluminium front guards and bonnet. Other distinguishing features include flared front and rear <b>wheel</b> <b>arches.</b> More supportive seats were fitted, and the turbo boost gauge and digital clock were removed from inside the instrument cluster. The clock was replaced with a torque meter that indicated how much torque was being delivered to the front wheels (0%–50%). Oil temp, voltage, and turbo boost gauges were fitted just above the climate control.|$|E
25|$|Research {{has shown}} that sirens mounted behind the engine grill or under the <b>wheel</b> <b>arches</b> {{produces}} less unwanted noise inside the passenger cabin and {{to the side and}} rear of the vehicle while maintaining noise levels to give adequate warnings. The inclusion of broadband sound to sirens has the ability to increase localisation of sirens, as in a directional siren, as a spread of frequencies makes use of the three ways the brain detects a direction of a sound: Interaural level difference, interaural time difference and head-related transfer function.|$|E
25|$|In July 1989, Plaxton {{bought the}} {{manufacturing}} {{rights for the}} coach products of its main domestic competitor, Duple for £4 million. This included the jigs for the Duple 300 and the Duple 425 integral. Duple Services Ltd., the spares and repair business, was also purchased. The 320 was re-worked by Plaxtons at Scarborough later in 1989 and 25 were built and sold as the Plaxton 321. Many components from the Paramount were used both internally and externally. Identifying traits being the squared up <b>wheel</b> <b>arches</b> and Paramount side mouldings. The 321 was around £6,000 cheaper than a comparable Paramount III. Further batches were considered {{but it is not}} known if they were actually built. The 321 was only available from Kirkby. The 340 with the higher floor was considered but none were built. A modified version of the 425 design was introduced in 1991 and was built by Carrosserie Lorraine, a French coachbuilder Plaxton had recently purchased from Iveco. Only 12 vehicles were manufactured, and Carrosserie Lorraine was subsequently closed in March 1992.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{evaluate}} the influence of textile soiling in the acoustic absorption of a <b>wheel</b> <b>arch.</b> In order to evaluate the influence of soiling it is carried out both a soil study characterization and an acoustic absorption measurement on real <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> samples. First, soil study starts with a short literature overview where the mechanisms of soil retention are analyzed. The field <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> study concerns visual observation of <b>wheel</b> <b>arch’s</b> special features followed by particle size measurement and soil visual and elemental analysis. These analysis were performed with a Laser Difraction equipment and a Scanning Electronic Microscope. Results conclude a range of particle size for soil collected and the identification of soil elemental composition, among other soiling features concerning textile porosity. The second part involves acoustic measurements for determining the airflow resistance value and the acoustic absorption coefficient of the same soiled textile analyzed before. Same measurements are repeated after removing soil from samples {{to see how much}} of the acoustic absorption can be restored. The determination of the acoustic absorption coefficient is performed with an impedance tube. Results show not only a null acoustic absorption in the soiled samples but also an insuficient improvement in the absorption after cleaning. Airflow resistance results prove that porosity is completely clogged even after cleaning. The paper concludes with short proposal for preserving textile from soiling and therefore maintain the original acoustic absorptio...|$|R
500|$|The {{development}} of the LS 460 and its variants, led by chief engineer Moritaka Yoshida, began as Lexus was shifting its design strategy towards a more diversified product lineup, with new-vehicle launches largely focused on global markets. Plans called for the next-generation LS to differentiate itself further beyond previous models in terms of design and technology. A [...] "Super LS" [...] model, priced above the US$100,000 ultra-luxury category, was also considered. Externally, the Lexus LS received the styling cues of Lexus' new design direction, called L-finesse. First shown on the LF-Sh concept, the vehicle gained body forms running {{the length of the}} car, <b>wheel</b> <b>arches,</b> arrow-shaped chrome trim, a lower-set grille, and crystalline adaptive headlamps.|$|E
500|$|The 1993 VR Commodore {{represented}} a major facelift {{of the second}} generation architecture leaving only the doors and roof untouched. Approximately 80percent of car was new {{in comparison to the}} preceding model. Exterior changes brought an overall smoother body, semicircular <b>wheel</b> <b>arches</b> and the [...] "twin-kidney" [...] grille—a Commodore styling trait which remained until the VY model of 2002 and remains a permanent staple on the HSV variants to this day. The rear-end treatment saw raised tail lights, implemented for safety reasons, and a driver's side airbag was introduced as an option: a first for an Australian-built car. Other safety features such as anti-lock brakes and independent rear suspension were only available with the new electronic GM 4L60-E automatic transmission. Along with a driver's airbag and cruise control, these features were packaged into a new Acclaim specification level: a family-oriented safety spec above the entry-level Executive. Holden's strong focus on safety {{can be seen in the}} Used Car Safety Ratings. The findings show that in an accident, VN/VP Commodores provide a [...] "worse than average" [...] level of occupant protection. However, the updated VR/VS models were found to provide a [...] "better than average" [...] level of safety protection. Holden issued a Series II revision in September 1994 bringing audible warning chimes for the handbrake and fuel level among other changes.|$|E
2500|$|The Mark V, {{launched}} in 1984, introduced [...] brake discs and plastic <b>wheel</b> <b>arches</b> (mini special arches) but retained the same Mark IV body shell shape.|$|E
5000|$|Modifications to engines, {{brakes and}} {{suspension}} are permitted {{and a different}} engine, from the same manufacturer as the body shell, may be utilised. Cars may be fitted with <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> flares, front air dams and rear deck spoilers.|$|R
25|$|The ACV30 {{featured}} several {{elements that}} influenced the eventual new Mini of 2001 {{such as the}} black a-pillars, chunky <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> detailing and white roof. The concept was attributed to the BMW designer Adrian van Hooydonk and Frank Stephenson.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} commercial components using Kraton G (thermoplastic rubber) in {{the automobile}} industry were in 1975.

2500|$|Although {{related to}} the Audi B5 S4, many of the outer body panels were altered, with wider front and rear <b>wheel</b> <b>arches,</b> {{to allow for the}} wider axle track on the RS4. [...] With unique front and rear bumpers and side sills, and the rear spoiler from the S4 Avant, the {{aerodynamic}} modifications achieved a drag coefficient of Cd0.34. [...] Although the B5 S4 came in a saloon car body style, the B5 RS4 was only available in the Avant version.|$|E

5000|$|Rossignol (Australia, 1993): Named for Skis Rossignol, {{this was}} a three-door V8i painted in Caprice blue-green {{metallic}} and fitted with a ski rack. It was also fitted with rub strips, <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> protectors, and other items that were optional on the base models.|$|R
50|$|The SEAT Altea Freetrack is {{dimensionally}} {{similar to}} the Altea XL, but is designed as compact sport-utility vehicle (SUV). It features raised suspension for increased ground clearance and larger plastic bumpers, and plastic <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> and sill extensions, which all increase its exterior dimensions.|$|R
2500|$|For 1963, the Grand Prix {{received}} revised sheetmetal {{shared with}} other full-size Pontiacs, but {{with its own}} squared-off roofline with a concave rear window that contrasted with the convertible-like roofline of the 1962 Grand Prix and continued on the 1963 to 1964 Catalina and Bonneville. Also new was a Pontiac-trademark split grille with vertical headlights and round parking lights and [...] "hidden" [...] taillights out back. Aside from grillework, taillight covering and bumpers, chrome trim was limited to lower rocker panels, <b>wheel</b> <b>arches</b> and roofline.|$|E
2500|$|The single-decker ECW {{body was}} just [...] wide and used some similar styling {{elements}} to those {{built for the}} heavier Bristol MW. The bus bodies were [...] high but the coaches were a little taller at the length varied depending on the chassis and whether it was to bus or coach style (see table below). A forward entrance was provided opposite the driver's position. Seats were forward-facing in pairs, but where <b>wheel</b> <b>arches</b> protruded above {{the floor of the}} bus body, the seats were turned sideways to give sufficient leg room.|$|E
2500|$|Shelby {{offers some}} {{unique set of}} {{modifications}} for the exterior. On the base GT, it [...] get a front splitter conversion with a GT500 rear spoiler and quarter glass covers.

50|$|Based on the mid-engined, {{rear wheel}} drive MG F, the ACV30 {{featured}} several elements that influenced the eventual new Mini of 2001 such as the black a-pillars, chunky <b>wheel</b> <b>arch</b> detailing and white roof. The concept was attributed to the BMW designer Adrian van Hooydonk and Frank Stephenson.|$|R
2500|$|The AMC Cavalier also {{featured}} curved sides, as if a fuselage, punctuated by full <b>wheel</b> <b>arches</b> and riding on [...] "mag" [...] wheels with whitewall tires. The rear roof pillars ("C" [...] pillar) were a [...] "flying buttress" [...] design providing the profile {{view of the}} car with a sweptback roof style to {{what appears to be}} a short rear deck. The rear window was recessed between the C pillars, making back area look similar to that of the General Motors' 1966-1967 [...] "A" [...] body platform two-door models, such as the Chevrolet Chevelle and Pontiac GTO. The swept-back panels and roof were covered in black vinyl to enhance the car's deep red metallic body finish.|$|E
2500|$|The car was {{introduced}} in September 1968. Power-assisted steering and leather upholstery were standard on the 2.8L De Luxe and 4.2L models and air conditioning was offered as an optional extra on the 4.2L. Daimler versions were launched in October 1969, {{in a series of}} television advertisements featuring Sir William. In these spots, he referred to the car as [...] "the finest Jaguar ever". An unusual feature, inherited from the Mark X and S-Type saloons, was the provision of twin fuel tanks, positioned {{on each side of the}} boot / trunk, and filled using two separately lockable filler caps: one on the top of each wing above the rear <b>wheel</b> <b>arches.</b> Preliminary reviews of the car were favourable, noting the effective brakes and good ride quality.|$|E
2500|$|However, this Honda Ridgeline has {{advanced}} safety features, modern electronic amenities, is offered in front-wheel drive (FWD) in the U.S., {{and has more}} traditional truck styling than before. [...] According to Automotive News, Honda's research clinics found that buyers made assumptions about toughness and payload based on the gaps in the <b>wheel</b> <b>arches</b> between the tire and the truck body, and {{the height of the}} bed. [...] If a pickup had a trailer hitch, people assumed it could tow more. [...] Based on these conclusions, Jim Loftus, the second generation Ridgeline's performance lead engineer, said, [...] "Those things were honestly kind of 'aha' moments or big surprises to us as a project team, and of course, we went back and incorporated all of those messages into the next-generation Ridgeline." ...|$|E
