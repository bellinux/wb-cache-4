Over forty cartoonists, from mainstream newspaper cartoonists to underground, independent comic artists, shared {{reflections on the}} power and influence of Schulz' art. Gilbert Hernandez wrote [...] "Peanuts {{was and still is}} for me a revelation. It's mostly from Peanuts where I was inspired to create the village of Palomar in Love and Rockets. Schulz' characters, the humor, the insight... gush, gush, gush, bow, bow, bow, grovel, grovel, grovel..."

2500|$|When {{he ran for}} {{governor}} in 2002, Romney strongly advocated stem-cell research, and he promised to lobby then-President George W. Bush to embrace it. During Romney's 2008 presidential campaign, he renounced his prior position {{and said that he}} agreed with Bush's decision to ban federal funding for research on excess embryos. He said that his views had been drastically altered in 2004 after discussing stem cell research with Douglas Melton, a stem cell researcher at Harvard University. The Harvard Stem Cell Institute was planning research that would have involved therapeutic cloning.
