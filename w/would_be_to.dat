5|$|A UNPA {{could be}} created through a {{stand-alone}} treaty. This {{would have the}} advantage that as few as 20 or 30 economically and geographically diverse countries could establish a UNPA, and it could expand as more countries ratified the treaty. Strauss notes {{that this is the}} method by which most international bodies, such the World Health Organization, International Labour Organization, and International Criminal Court, were founded. The way to get started presumably <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> hold a conference of plenipotentiaries to draft the treaty; then the ratification process would begin.|$|E

5|$|A stereospecific form of (S)-mephedrone {{could be}} {{prepared}} via Friedel–Crafts acylation. The {{first step in}} the synthesis <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> react toluene and (S)-N-trifluoroacetylalanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminium chloride, then deprotect the intermediate with hydrochloric acid-propyl alcohol. This would produce (S)-4-methylcathinone, which could then be methylated to produce mephedrone.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Joseph Stalin, Nikita Khrushchev became the Soviet leader {{following}} the deposition and execution of Lavrentiy Beria and the pushing aside of rivals Georgy Malenkov and Vyacheslav Molotov. On 25 February 1956, Khrushchev shocked delegates to the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party by cataloguing and denouncing Stalin's crimes. As part of a campaign of de-Stalinization, he declared {{that the only way}} to reform and move away from Stalin's policies <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> acknowledge errors made in the past.|$|E
5|$|Another option <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> {{implement}} fiscal devaluation, {{based on}} an idea originally developed by John Maynard Keynes in 1931. According to this neo-Keynesian logic, policy makers can increase the competitiveness of an economy by lowering corporate tax burden such as employer's social security contributions, while offsetting the loss of government revenues through higher taxes on consumption (VAT) and pollution, i.e. by pursuing an ecological tax reform.|$|E

Instrument payload could include a radio subsystem, laser altimeter, magnetometer, Langmuir probe, and a mapping camera. The Europa Orbiter received a go-ahead in 1999 but was canceled in 2002. This orbiter featured a special ice-penetrating radar that would allow it to scan below the surface.|$|E

5|$|In October 1915 {{pack ice}} in the Weddell Sea had sunk Endurance, leaving Shackleton and his companions adrift on a {{precarious}} ice surface. Throughout the duration of their survival, the group drifted northward until April 1916, when the floe on which they had encamped broke up. They then made their way in the ship's lifeboats to Elephant Island, where Shackleton decided that {{the most effective means}} of obtaining rescue <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> sail one of the lifeboats to South Georgia.|$|E

The Court also may not make an injunction against a government officer if the effect of doing so <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> provide relief {{that could not be}} obtained against the Government directly. Section 2(2) of the Act makes it clear that the term {{civil proceedings}} includes proceedings for judicial review.|$|E

5|$|Martin Wolf, an {{economics}} leader writer with the Financial Times, suggested {{there may be}} advantages in western economies taking a more confrontational approach against China, which in recent years had been {{by far the biggest}} practitioner of competitive devaluation. Though he advised that rather than using protectionist measures which may spark a trade war, a better tactic <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> use targeted capital controls against China to prevent them buying foreign assets in order to further devalue the yuan, as previously suggested by Daniel Gros, Director of the Centre for European Policy Studies.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Soult {{was making}} his own plans. He knew that Blake {{intended}} to join forces with Beresford, but {{he thought that the}} Spanish divisions were still several days march away. Based on that erroneous premise, Soult decided that his best course of action <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> turn the Allies' southern flank, thus driving a wedge between the two parts of Beresford's army. Soult hoped that as a result he could defeat his opponents in detail, overcoming Beresford's force and then turning south to deal with Blake's divisions.|$|E

The ability to vary reflectivity to different wavelengths of light could also lead to efficient optical switches that could function like transistors, enabling engineers to make fast optical computers and routers.|$|E
5|$|The Sedan bridgeheads {{were still}} not safe. French forces were massing to the south. Guderian {{decided it was}} better to mount an {{aggressive}} defence given the lack of any suitable anti-tank weapons for a defensive battle. The better option <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> attack rather than defend. The advance of the 1st and 2nd Panzer Divisions had assisted his progress. They ran into and defeated elements of X Corps near Chemery. The French Corps was heading towards Sedan, but withdrew southward after the engagement. Any potential threat on the German western flank had been removed.|$|E

Marshall replied that as much as the Army would like to have Middleton back in uniform, all the Army could do <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> place him in some training role, which would not effectively use his battle experience.|$|E
