500|$|The {{album is}} made up of two {{different}} classes of songs: lengthy improvisations from the band's live performances and shorter songs that Barrett had written. Barrett's LSD intake escalated part-way through the album's recording sessions. Although in his 2005 autobiography Mason recalled the sessions as relatively trouble-free, Smith disagreed and claimed that Barrett was unresponsive to his suggestions and constructive criticism. In an attempt to build a relationship with the band, Smith played jazz on the piano while the band joined in. These jam sessions worked well with Waters, who was apparently helpful, and Wright, who was [...] "laid-back". Smith's attempts to connect with Barrett were less productive: [...] "With Syd, I eventually realised I was <b>wasting</b> <b>my</b> time." [...] Smith later admitted that his traditional ideas of music were somewhat at odds with the psychedelic background from which Pink Floyd had come. Nevertheless, he managed to [...] "discourage the live ramble", as band manager Peter Jenner called it, guiding the band toward producing songs with a more manageable length.|$|E

He also reflected on his inability {{to be happy with}} his work, [...] "I feel the same thing about everything I do. The day I say, 'It's good' is the day I should start doing something else." [...] Ledger liked to wait between jobs so that he would start creatively hungry on new projects. In his own words, acting was about harnessing [...] "the infinite power of belief," [...] thus using belief as a tool for creating.|$|E
