It is shown that especially the poetical theories of French classicist writers (particularly d'Aubignac's La pratique du thÃƒÂ©ÃƒÂ¢tre) have been influential. The secondary plots in these tragedies are studied under a threefold perspective.

40|$|Relationships of {{implanted}} testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and estradiol- 17 β to collagen {{degradation and}} intramuscular collagen concentration and stability were determined.

Intramuscular collagen content in both experiments was higher (P 3 ̆c. 05) in muscles of rams than in muscles of wethers.

40|$|Low fibre {{strength}} is becoming widely recognised {{as a major}} problem for merino wools. The wool fibre is now weaker than many synthetics, and as the speed of manufacturing increases, price penalties for low staple strength (SS) are being imposed above the traditional limit of 25 - 30 N/ktex. Currently, a quarter of all Australian merino wool is penalised for low SS. Fibre strength must be improved if the wool industry is to maintain its position in the market. For these reasons, a program within the Cooperative Research Centre for Premium Quality Wool aims to improve SS by focussing a co-ordinated effort by the Western Australian (WA) Dept of Agriculture, CSIRO and The University of Western Australia, supported by the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation and various industry and farmer groups. Considering the magnitude of the problem, it is surprising that so little is known about its causes or prevention. Standardised measures of SS have come into general use only recently, so there are few published data about its relative importance in weaners, lambing ewes and <b>wethers</b> <b>or</b> about management procedures that may predispose towards it. Furthermore, the strength of a staple is a composite measure depending on the strength of the fibres that make it up and their uniformity. The relative contributions of the intrinsic strength of individual fibres, the effect of changes in fibr...|$|R

In a one sector endogenous growth model with {{private and public}} capital, {{similar to that in}} Barro (1990), we find that raising taxes on factors’ income as part of an optimal fiscal policy is a more pervasive result than it seems. The interaction of technological and fiscal externalities is central for this result. For instance, high enough levels of wasteful expenditures to output ratio could make positive income taxes enhance welfare. This ratio would need to be smaller, the lower the spillover externality and/or the larger the elasticities of private and public capital in the private production function. ...|$|R

40|$|Lamb adipose tissue, {{representing}} 4 breeds, 3 sex-types and 3 weight categories, {{were studied}} {{to measure the}} variation in the flavor profile between individual animals, based on breed, sex- type and carcass weight. The flavor concentrates were prepared by steam distillation, ether extraction and fractionation. Pooled samples were prepared {{in the same way}} to measure any variations due to methodology. Gas chromatographic separation and statistical analysis, based on analysis of variance, indicated that 21 peaks out of 124 peaks showed significant differences (at 5 % level or 1 % level). Among these 21 peaks, 5 were affected by breed, 4 by sex-type, 8 by carcass weight and 7 peaks were influenced by the interaction of breed, sex-type and carcass weight. Variations due to breed revealed that Rambouillet lambs possessed the highest proportion of flavor peaks which showed significant differences, with Targhee lambs the second highest, Columbia the third and Suffolk- cross the lowest proportion of flavor compounds. The effect of sex-type suggested that was contributed to the highest concentration of peaks which might influence the expression of flavor. However, there was no evidence showing that the concentration of peaks for ewes was greater than that of <b>wethers</b> <b>or</b> vice versa. Differences associated with weight indicated that light animals yielded a higher concentration of flavor volatiles, medium weight lambs the second and heavy lambs the lowest concentration of volatiles.
