5|$|At {{that first}} meeting on 28 January 1981, which lasted over seven hours, Heidemann offered Kujau a deposit of only 100,000DMs to agree the deal, which Kujau did not accept. At a second meeting the {{following}} day, the reporter revealed an additional lure {{he had brought}} with him: a uniform which he said was Göring's. Kujau tentatively agreed to provide the diaries and told Heidemann that he <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> {{as soon as he}} could arrange to receive them from East Germany. As a sign of good faith Heidemann lent the uniform to the forger, to show alongside his collection of other uniforms from the top Nazis; for his part, Kujau gave the journalist a painting purportedly by Hitler. Both the painting and uniform were fakes.|$|E

25|$|Megan Waterman, 22, of South Portland, Maine, {{went missing}} on June 6, 2010, after placing {{advertisements}} on Craigslist as an escort. The day before, {{she had told}} her 20-year-old boyfriend {{that she was going}} out and <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> later. At the time of her disappearance, she was staying at a motel in Hauppauge, New York, 15 miles northeast of Gilgo Beach. Her body was also recovered in December 2010.|$|E

25|$|In August 2007, Masuzoe was {{appointed}} as Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare. He served {{in this position}} until 2009 under three consecutive prime ministers (Shinzō Abe, Yasuo Fukuda and Tarō Asō). Abe reportedly appointed Masuzoe, a frequent critic of Abe's policies, to silence critics who <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> a factionalist. Masuzoe came under fire during his tenure for an incident {{in which the government}} failed to match 50 million pension records with their owners, which led Democratic Party of Japan head Ichirō Ozawa to call for Masuzoe's censure if he did not apologize.|$|E
25|$|She {{participated in}} a war bond selling {{campaign}} with a sailor named Eddie Rhodes. Rhodes was in the crowd at each Lamarr appearance, and she <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> up on stage. She would briefly flirt with him before asking the audience if she should give him a kiss. The crowd would of course say yes, to which Hedy would reply that she would if enough people bought war bonds. After enough bonds were purchased, she would give Rhodes his kiss, and he would head back into the audience. Then they would head off to the next war bond rally.|$|E
500|$|Tracy was an avowed Catholic, but his cousin, Jane Feely, {{said that}} he did not devoutly follow the religion: [...] "he was often not a {{practical}} Catholic either. I <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> a spiritual Catholic." [...] Garson Kanin, a friend of Tracy's for 25 years, described him as [...] "a true believer" [...] who respected his religion. At periods in his life, Tracy attended Mass regularly. Tracy did not believe actors should publicize their political views, but in 1940 lent his name to the [...] "Hollywood for Roosevelt" [...] committee and personally identified as a Democrat.|$|E

500|$|Marsh and {{his club}} sought a speedy {{resolution}} to the problem because Sheffield Shield matches were due to begin {{in a matter of}} weeks. They perceived a danger that other umpires in the Sydney competition would follow Curran's lead and call Marsh, effectively outlawing him, resulting in the loss of the club's leading strike bowler. By wearing the splints, Marsh showed his belief that Curran <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> on the second day. This never happened, because Curran withdrew from his position by the luncheon adjournment on the second day, believing that he had been humiliated. Curran's resignation was widely criticised by the media and he was reprimanded by the First Grade Committee for his action. Bowling [...] "as fast as ever", Marsh went on to finish with 6/125 from 33 overs as New South Wales were bowled out for 320.|$|E
500|$|Hans Lundgren {{was born}} on 3 November 1957 in Spånga, the son of Sigrid Birgitta (née Tjerneld), a {{language}} teacher, and Karl Johan Hugo Lundgren, an engineer and economist for the Swedish government. He lived in Spånga {{until the age of}} 13, when he moved to his grandparents' home in Nyland, Ångermanland. Some sources wrongly state 1959 as his year of birth, but Lundgren himself has confirmed it to be 1957. He has two sisters and an older brother; he was raised in the Lutheran church. Lundgren claims his father was physically abusive and vented his frustration on his wife and eldest son. He has stated that, during his tirades, his father <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> a [...] "loser", which motivated him later as he grew more ambitious to prove himself. But he also said, [...] "I still love my father, no matter what happened. There are many things about him I still admire. As a child, I was probably too much like him, very stubborn—perhaps that's what he couldn't deal with." [...] He has cited his troubled relationship with his father as the reason he developed a desire to participate in heavy contact sports such as boxing and karate.|$|E
500|$|Recording {{took more}} time than usual since Madonna and Leonard fought [...] "tooth and nail" [...] in the studio. According to author Lucy O'Brien, the singer wanted to prove that her second chance as a record {{producer}} (following her previous album True Blue) was not a fluke. Leonard started working on the chord changes for the verses and the chorus. He had hired guitarist Bruce Gaitsch and bass guitar player Guy Pratt {{to work on the}} track. Pratt had in turn hired some additional drummers. On the day of the recording, the drummers canceled, which irritated Madonna, and she started shouting and swearing profusely at Leonard and Pratt. The producer then hired British drum and guitar players such as Chester Kamens, David Williams and Dann Huff. He commented that the choice was deliberate since he was a fan of British rock, and wanted that kind of attitude and quirkiness of the musicians in [...] "Like a Prayer", {{as well as the other}} songs of the album. Pratt was not fired, but later he realized that Madonna did not forgive him; she <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> at late nights for his opinion, and urgently ask him to come to the recording studio, only to be dismissed.|$|E

500|$|For {{the first}} time in 20 years, Australia had failed to win a Test series at home, the last being the infamous Bodyline series of 1932–33. Wisden called the 2–2 result, [...] "... the biggest cricket shock for many years." [...] The absence of Lindwall and Miller in the later part of the series exposed the {{limitations}} of the other Australian bowlers and did not augur well for the future. Hassett made it known that the tour of England in 1953 would be his farewell to the game. The selectors included only two specialist opening batsmen in the team, which caused problems when McDonald was injured and Morris struggled for form. This forced Hassett to play as an opener in the Tests; while Morris’s old partner Barnes was in England to report on the tour as a reporter, his history of criticising cricket administrators meant that officialdom <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> into the squad to cover for McDonald. There were also tensions among the team off the field. The more experienced members of the team from Hassett’s generation were World War II veterans, and were happy to be alive and tended to enjoy drinking and partying, while the younger members tended to be teetotallers. This led to a divide as the seniors regularly halted the team bus for drinking stops at the roadside pubs, leaving their younger teammates waiting. Some of the non-drinkers said that because of the frequent visits at pubs, the team bus only travelled approximately 15km each hour.|$|E
500|$|Specter and Sestak {{participated in}} an August 14 panel {{discussion}} hosted by Netroots Nation, which included questions from online viewers consisting mainly of liberal and progressive bloggers and advocates. Media reports suggested Specter faced tougher questions from the crowd, with many questioning whether they could trust him based on his switching parties. Specter dismissed suggestions that his recent Democratic votes were politically motivated by the primary, and cited his support of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and Children's Health Insurance Reauthorization Act as proof of his Democratic credentials. Sestak argued a change in leadership was necessary and that his military background as a United States Navy admiral gave him the necessary experience. Sestak {{also pointed out that}} Specter worked with former Senator Bob Dole to defeat President Bill Clinton's health care plan in 1993. When some in the crowd brought up how Senator Chuck Grassley, a past ally of Specter's, was arguing that Obama's health care plan would lead to [...] "death panels", Specter said that Grassley was wrong and that he <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> about the matter. When some in the crowd chanted, [...] "Call him now!", Specter took several audience members backstage and left a phone message for Grassley as they watched. Salon.com said based on the stunt, [...] "Specter may have won the day, if not the battle". However, a straw poll of 250 online activists attending the event showed Sestak was preferred to Specter by a vote of 46 percent to 10 percent.|$|E
2500|$|On October 26, 1980 he was beatified by Pope John Paul II, who <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> the [...] "Apostle of the Rosary" [...] and {{mentioned}} him specifically in his apostolic letter [...] "Rosarium Virginis Mariae" [...] (The Rosary of the Virgin Mary).|$|E
60|$|Thunderfoot the Bison, {{often called}} Buffalo, {{is not a}} {{handsome}} fellow, as you very well {{know if you have}} seen him or a picture of him. His head is carried low, very near the ground, and on his shoulders is a great hump. No, you wouldn't <b>call</b> <b>him</b> handsome. You <b>would</b> hardly <b>call</b> <b>him</b> good-looking even. In fact, you <b>would,</b> I suspect, <b>call</b> <b>him</b> homely. Certainly there is nothing about him to suggest pride. Yet according to the story Digger the Badger once told Peter Rabbit, pride and nothing less was the cause of that big hump which makes Thunderfoot appear so clumsy and homely.|$|R
5000|$|The {{movie was}} made without Paul Morrissey and Joe Dellesandro, the director-star team from {{previous}} Warhol movies. Perry King played a Dellesandro-type role {{and says the}} crew <b>would</b> sometimes <b>call</b> <b>him</b> [...] "Joe". Director Jed Johnson was Warhol's companion at the time.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{received}} a message before starting that one whose orders {{he could not}} neglect <b>would</b> <b>call</b> upon <b>him</b> this evening, and he therefore sent me to the rendezvous. I have been looking anxiously for you, but until now had not seen you." ...|$|R

2500|$|On September 11, Afzali called Zazi's father. Zazi's father then {{spoke with}} Zazi, {{told him that}} [...] "they" [...] had shown Afzali his photos and photos of others, said Afzali <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> and he should speak with {{him as soon as}} possible, and added [...] "So, before {{anything}} else, speak with [...] See if you need to go to [...] or to make ... yourself aware, hire an attorney." [...] Afzali called Zazi, and told him that the authorities had asked him about [...] "you guys." [...] He also asked Zazi for the telephone number of one of the other men whose photos he had been shown, and set up a meeting with him.|$|E
2500|$|Martin {{was born}} in Bowling Green, Warren County Kentucky, at Western University Hospital. He has written and talked {{extensively}} about his gender dysphoria and transgender issues. He is a gay man, and has said, [...] "Ever since I {{was old enough to}} know what gay men were, I've considered myself a gay man that happens to have been born in a female body, and that's the perspective I'm coming from." [...] In 2003, Martin wrote that, while gender theorists like Kate Bornstein <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> a [...] "nonoperative transsexual", Martin would not insist on a pedantic label, writing [...] "I'm just me". In August 2010, he began the process of gender reassignment, and, in 2011 expressed that he would prefer to be referred to by male pronouns.|$|E
60|$|He {{turned into}} the {{principal}} allee of the town. There was a long white building at one end,--the Bahnhof: {{at the other end}} he remembered a dye-house. He had, a year ago, met its hospitable proprietor: he <b>would</b> <b>call</b> upon <b>him</b> now.|$|R
50|$|After {{retirement}} in 1990, Wilson {{served as an}} adviser to the denomination's Euro-Asia Division.

2500|$|When the war ended, Laine {{soon found}} himself [...] "scuffling" [...] again, and was {{eventually}} given {{a place to}} stay by Jarvis. Jarvis also did his best to help promote the struggling singer's career, and Laine soon had a small, regional following. In the meantime, Laine would make the rounds of the bigger jazz clubs, hoping that the featured band <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> up to perform a number with them. In late 1946, Hoagy Carmichael heard him singing at Billy Berg's club in Los Angeles, and this was when success finally arrived. Not knowing that Carmichael was in the audience, Laine sang the Carmichael-penned standard [...] "Rockin' Chair" [...] when Slim Gaillard called him up to the stage to sing. This eventually led to a contract with the newly established Mercury records. Laine and Carmichael would later collaborate on a song, [...] "Put Yourself in My Place, Baby".|$|E
2500|$|Another {{recurring}} {{character was}} Dr. Vink (Aron Tager). He was a physically imposing {{man who would}} often appear as a mad scientist, sorcerer, and the like. When he enters, he introduces himself by saying, [...] "Vink's the name. Dr. Vink." [...] He would also get his name mispronounced, usually something like [...] "Dr. Fink?" [...] When this happened, he would respond [...] "Vink. With a va-va-va!" [...] Often, the protagonist <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> a [...] "nutbag" [...] behind his back, assuming he could not hear him, only to have him reply later, [...] "...and I am not a nutbag." [...] Unlike Sardo whose character was set in a magic shop, Dr. Vink had many 'unique endeavors' as he called them, for his stories. These ranged from living deep in the woods conducting strange nature experiments, being a retired filmmaker, owning his own restaurant as head chef and lastly a barbershop. His activities were usually villainous and designed to put the characters in peril and allow him the last laugh. However, in his last appearance, [...] "The Tale of Cutter's Treasure" [...] (which was told by both Frank and Gary), he allied himself with Sardo and the main characters without his usual maliciousness. He appeared in Frank's stories. Aron Tager also played the carnival worker who {{stands in front of}} the Funhouse and invites people to go inside in the episode [...] "The Tale of the Laughing in the Dark." ...|$|E
2500|$|In modern cricket the bowler is no balled if he bowls {{without some}} part of the front foot (either {{grounded}} or raised) behind the popping crease when it lands (it is still a legal ball if it slides over the line) and if his back foot is not wholly inside the return crease. In the 1940s the front foot rule had not been written, so the requirement was that one foot be behind the bowling crease and fast bowlers tended to drag the toe of their rear foot over the bowling crease to decrease the distance between them and the batsmen when they released the ball. If they timed it well the delivery was made when the toe was still behind the crease, but they could drag it over the line and they would be no balled. This proved to be a particular problem in the 1950s. As you can see on this old cine film of Ray Lindwall dragging his foot over the bowling crease[...] It should have been called as a no ball as his rear foot was past the crease when he delivered the ball, easy to see in a slow motion replay, but difficult for the umpire. Lindwall's action was a text book model, but he was known for his heavy drag. Alan Kippax said that he watched Lindwall for 45 minutes in the Fourth Test at Adelaide without once seeing him bowl a legal delivery and sometimes his foot dragged 18inches over the crease. However, the fast bowler was only called for no balling twice in the series, which Clif Cary thought was a disservice to Lindwall as the English umpires <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> in 1948 if he did not correct his action in time (this proved not to be a problem). Lindwall himself wrote that if the no-ball law was enforced strictly almost every bowler would be no-balled and “the spirit of the law demanded that the bowler should land behind the bowling crease and as long as I did that I was playing the game”. [...] The New South Wales Cricket Association asked him to bowl a yard back from his present delivery, but Bill O'Reilly advised him not to change until no-balled by an umpire and as a result Lindwall kept his action unchanged.|$|E
