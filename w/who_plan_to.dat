5|$|Written by Donald Tosh.

At the point it was turned down by the production team Tosh had completed a script for the first episode and notes for the subsequent three episodes. Tosh completed a full storyline for DWM in 1994. Set on an Earth Space station it deals with a conflict between the staff of the station and the Rosemariners, a group <b>who</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> hold the staff hostage in return for Earth supplying them with sophisticated weapons.

5|$|Twenty {{years after}} Sarah's death, Joel {{works as a}} {{smuggler}} in the Boston quarantine zone with his friend and partner Tess. While out searching for a former accomplice who stole some of their merchandise, Joel and Tess are tasked by Marlene, an acquaintance and leader of a rebel militia called the Fireflies, to smuggle Ellie to a rendezvous point at the Massachusetts State House. Making their way there, Joel discovers that Ellie is immune to the infection. Upon their arrival, Tess reveals that she has sustained a bite on the journey, and insists Joel finds Tommy {{in order to continue}} the mission. Joel is initially surly and short towards Ellie, though he begins to warm up to her as their journey continues. This is compounded when Joel, having initially asked Tommy to carry on in his place after meeting up with him at his settlement in Jackson County, Colorado, changes his mind and carries on as planned. Their bond deepens when Ellie nearly loses Joel to a severe injury, and when he comes to her aid after she is nearly killed by a band of cannibals. Ultimately, Joel shows his devotion to Ellie when he chooses to rescue her from the doctors <b>who</b> <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> remove and examine her brain, as opposed to allowing her to die.
