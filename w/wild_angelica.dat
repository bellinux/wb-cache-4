The seven herbs and spices include: poppy seeds “khash-khaash”, <b>wild</b> rice “berenj”, <b>angelica</b> “sabzi khoshk”, salt “namak”, nigella seeds “raziyaneh”, black tea “chai” and frankincense “kondor”.|$|R
50|$|Angelica archangelica, {{commonly}} known as garden <b>angelica,</b> <b>wild</b> celery, and Norwegian angelica, is a biennial plant from the Apiaceae family, a subspecies of which is cultivated for its sweetly scented edible stems and roots. Like several other species in Apiaceae, its appearance is similar to several poisonous species (Conium, Heracleum, and others), {{and should not be}} consumed unless it has been identified with absolute certainty. Synonyms include Archangelica officinalis Hoffm., and Archangelica officinalis var. himalaica C.B.Clarke.|$|R
50|$|Modern Icelandic chefs usually emphasise {{the quality}} of {{available}} ingredients rather than age-old cooking traditions and methods. Numerous restaurants in Iceland specialise in seafood. At the annual Food and Fun chef's competition (held since 2004), competitors create innovative dishes with fresh ingredients produced in Iceland. Points of pride are {{the quality of}} the lamb meat, seafood, and (more recently) skyr. Other local ingredients include seabirds and waterfowl (including their eggs), salmon and trout, crowberry, blueberry, rhubarb, Iceland moss, wild mushrooms, <b>wild</b> thyme, lovage, <b>angelica,</b> and dried seaweed, as well as a wide array of dairy products.|$|R

60|$|The meadow {{round about}} was all full of lilies {{of the valley}} and <b>wild</b> roses. <b>Angelica,</b> {{not knowing what to}} do, at length plucked a {{quantity}} of these, and with her white hand she dropped them {{on the face of the}} sleeper. He woke up; and seeing who it was, not only received her salutations with a change of countenance, but remounting his horse, galloped away through the thickest part of the forest. In vain the beautiful creature followed and called after him; in vain asked him what she had done to be so despised, and entreated him, at any rate, to take care how he went so fast. Rinaldo disappeared, leaving her to wring her hands in despair; and she returned in tears to the spot on which she had found him sleeping. There, in her turn, she herself lay down, pressing the spot of earth on which he had lain; and so, weeping and lamenting, yet blessing every flower and bit of grass that he had touched, fell asleep out of fatigue and sorrow.|$|R
25|$|On Nunivak, most {{indigenous}} {{plants were}} traditionally gathered {{by women and}} children when the men were harvesting other available resources (e.g., caribou, waterfowl, seal). While fresh spring greens provided a welcome addition to the diet, which in winter was based largely on dried and stored foods, other greens were harvested throughout the year as they ripened, and used {{with some of those}} stored for winter use. With the melting of the island's snow pack, local greens and berries not picked during the previous fall's harvest, begin to appear and were added to the local diet. Depending on the time the ice pack began to break up, Cup'ig families would leave their winter villages and move to spring seal camps. Cup'ig men would journey out along the ice to harvest arriving sea mammals (i.e., seals, walrus) while the women would spend much of their time harvesting available plant resources (greens and seaweeds) and shellfish. Early spring plants included: marsh marigold (Caltha palustris), sour dock (Rumex arcticus), <b>wild</b> celery (<b>Angelica</b> lucida), <b>wild</b> lettuce (Draba borealis or D. hyperborea), wild parsnip (Ligusticum hultonii), wild rhubarb (Polygonum viviparum), mountain sorrel (Oxyria digylla), Pallas buttercup (Ranunculus pallasii), and Labrador tea (Ledum pallustre decumbens).|$|R
50|$|Items {{are placed}} on this spread: a Mirror (of fate), two Candelabras (representing {{the bride and groom}} and their bright future), a tray of seven multi-colored herbs and spices (including poppy seeds, <b>wild</b> rice, <b>angelica,</b> salt, nigella seeds, black tea, and frankincense). These herbs and spices play {{specific}} roles ranging from breaking spells and witchcraft, to blinding the evil eye, to burning evil spirits. In addition to these herbs/spices, a special baked and decorated flatbread, a basket of decorated eggs, decorated almonds, walnuts and hazelnuts (in their shell to represent fertility), a basket of pomegranates/apples (for a joyous future as these fruits are considered divine), a cup of rose water (from special Persian roses)—which helps perfume the air, a bowl made out of sugar (apparently to sweeten life for the newlywed couple), and a brazier holding burning coals and sprinkled with wild rue (as a way to keep the evil eye away and to purify the wedding ritual) {{are placed on}} the spread as well. Finally, there are additional items that must be placed on the spread, including a bowl of gold coins (to represent wealth and prosperity), a scarf/shawl made of silk/fine fabric (to be held over the bride and groom’s head at certain points in the ceremony), two sugar cones—which are ground above the bride and groom's head, thus symbolizing sweetness/happiness, a cup of honey (to sweeten life), a needle and seven strands of colored thread (the shawl that is held above the bride and groom’s head is sewn together with the string throughout the ceremony), and a copy of the couple’s Holy Book (other religions require different texts); but all of these books symbolize God's blessing for the couple.An early age in marriage—especially for brides—is a long documented feature of marriage in Iran. While the people of Iran have been trying to legally change this practice by implementing a higher minimum in marriage, there have been countless blocks to such an attempt. Although the average age of women being married has increased by about five years in the past couple decades, young girls being married is still common feature of marriage in Iran—even though there is an article in the Iranian Civil Code that forbid the marriage of women younger than 15 years of age and males younger than 18 years of age.|$|R

50|$|Part is {{maintained}} as wet meadow by annual mowing or grazing and devil's-bit scabious, knapweed, meadowsweet and <b>wild</b> <b>angelica</b> are abundant. Small remnants of raised mire vegetation including sphagnum moss, bog rosemary and royal fern.|$|E
50|$|Lower {{down the}} valley, species {{including}} alpine cinquefoil, lily-of-the-valley, mountain melick and herb paris, blue sesleria, common valerian and <b>wild</b> <b>angelica.</b> The limestone outcrops have uncommon species including rock whitebeam and Solomon's seal {{as well as}} bird's-eye primrose, butterwort, rockrose, dropwort and limestone bedstraw.|$|E
50|$|The hedge flora are {{dominated}} by cow parsley, and the ditches have wetland flowers including water figwort and <b>wild</b> <b>angelica.</b> A small adjacent woodland, which is probably ancient, has nesting birds, including sparrowhawks, willow warblers and stock doves. Muntjac deer are often seen there.|$|E
50|$|The meadows are on peat {{overlying}} spring-fed chalk, with {{a variety}} of soil conditions. Some areas are dry calcareous pasture, and others are wet neutral and marshy acidic grassland. Herbs include <b>wild</b> <b>angelica,</b> marsh valerian and fen bedstraw, and the nationally rare umbellifer Cambridge milk-parsley is also present.|$|E
50|$|Typical wetland {{plants are}} {{present at the}} site such as hemlock water {{dropwort}} as well as species only found in clean constantly running water like as watercress. Also noted at the site are green figwort, Brooklime speedwell, <b>wild</b> <b>angelica,</b> opposite-leaved golden saxifrage, green alkanet, reed canarygrass, giant hogweed, bishopweed, celandine, and Himalayan balsam.|$|E
50|$|Gwen and Vera's Fields {{support an}} {{abundant}} population of wild daffodils amongst other species. wood anemones are also abundant, {{moving into the}} fields from the adjacent woodland. Other flowering plants include cowslip, common knapweed, oxeye daisy, perforate St John's-wort, <b>wild</b> <b>angelica</b> and meadowsweet. Meadow saffron is recorded for the west field as well as common spotted orchid.|$|E
50|$|This {{marsh and}} fen on shallow peat is formed by seepage from the {{boundary}} between clay and limestone. Plants in wet areas include blunt-flowered rush, marsh pennywort, <b>wild</b> <b>angelica</b> and Menyanthes trifoliata, a rare species of bogbean. Drier areas have grasses and herbs which attract butterflies and dragonflies. The site includes a stretch of Harpers Brook.|$|E
50|$|The {{underlying}} geology {{ensures that}} most of the site is well drained, favouring lime-loving plants - the calcicoles. There are, however, localised areas with poorer drainage and in which some lime-hating plants can be found - the calcifuges - such as bracken Pteridium aquilinum, as well as plants associated with water-logged conditions such as common valerian Valeriana officinalis and <b>wild</b> <b>angelica</b> Angelica sylvestris.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} fields and meadows in the Telkkämäki {{heritage}} farm {{because of the}} mowing and grazing of the grounds associated with agriculture. Plant species in the old slash-and-burn clearings include the bluebutton (or field scabious), common yarrow (Achillea millefolium) and rough hawkbit. Meadow flowers {{to be found in}} Telkkämäki include the fireweed, meadow buttercup, <b>wild</b> <b>angelica</b> and red campion.|$|E
50|$|Since sheep stopped grazing at Skaftafell, the {{vegetation}} has undergone great changes and is quickly making inroads on the glacial deposits {{in front of}} Skaftafellsjökull and in Morsárdalur valley. Species such as garden angelica, <b>wild</b> <b>angelica,</b> sea pea and arctic river beauty, are hardly ever found on grazing land, but have now become common. Birch and willows are also starting to colonise land.|$|E
50|$|The steep-sided clough has an {{extensive}} system of good pathways around it, enabling visitors {{to experience a}} blanket of bluebells in the spring as well as wood sorrel and <b>wild</b> <b>angelica.</b> There is also {{a wide variety of}} woodland birds, such as chaffinch, treecreeper and nuthatch, throughout the year. A stream runs through {{the entire length of the}} reserve into the old mill pond at Cheetham Mill just outside the reserve.|$|E
50|$|This {{species has}} a single annual {{generation}} (univoltine). Adults emerge in late summer. Males {{can be seen from}} June until September, while females have been recorded from February to October. After mating the males die and the females overwinter and reappear in the spring. As adults, they eat plant juices, honeydew larvae and nectar of various flowers, mainly <b>wild</b> <b>angelica</b> (Angelica sylvestris), hogweed (Heracleum), blackbery (Rubus fruticosus), nightshades (Solanaceae), goldenrod (Solidago) and thistle.|$|E
50|$|Aquatic plants {{includes}} reed, club-rush, wood club-rush, broadleaf cattail, flowering rush, water hemlock, yellow iris, yellow loosestrife, bittersweet, yellow water-lily, white water-lily, broad-leaved pondweed, red pondweed, whorled water-milfoil, amphibious bistort, water-soldier, frogbit, duckweed, greater bladderwort, {{and greater}} duckweed. Along {{the shores of}} the lake are hybrid crack willow, alder, bay willow, grey willow, aspen, ash, purple-loosestrife, marsh fern, <b>wild</b> <b>angelica,</b> marsh woundwort, gypsywort, creeping spearwort, marsh cinquefoil, marsh-marigold, bittersweet, skullcap, corn mint, meadowsweet, trifid bur-marigold, and purple small-reed.|$|E
50|$|The {{north shore}} is mainly vegetated with scrub and woodland, {{including}} willow, blackthorn, elder, birch, hawthorn, and hazel. Common spotted orchids {{grow in the}} base-rich flushed areas. At the extreme south eastern corner of the site there {{is an area of}} marshy grassland with abundant meadow-sweet, <b>wild</b> <b>angelica,</b> common knapweed, and sneezewort and where there is periodic flooding of the shore you can also find species like common spike rush, reed canary grass, lesser spearwort, and amphibious bistort.|$|E
5000|$|A {{woodland}} {{has developed}} on finer alluvial deposits containing alder (Alnus glutinosa) and willow (Salix spp.) with some birch (Betula sp.), elm (Ulmus glabra) and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus) and Scot’s pine (Pinus sylvestris). Wooded areas exhibit ground-cover of dog’s mercury (Mercurialis perennis), <b>wild</b> <b>angelica</b> (Angelica sylvestris), red campion (Silene dioica), hedge woundwort (Stachys sylvatica), moschatel (Adoxa moschatellina) and wood sage (Teucrium scordonia). The river margin {{is marked by}} himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera), lesser burdock (Arctium minus) and monkey flower (Mimulus guttatus).|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} native to Europe and Asia and grows in fields, hedgerows, open woods, marshes and fens. Woodlands, dappled shade, shady forest margins, rarely in deep shade. Will grow in light (sandy), medium (loamy) and heavy (clay) soils. Angelica proliferates in acid, neutral and basic (alkaline) soils. It can grow in full shade (deep woodland) semi-shade (light woodland) or no shade. It {{can be found in}} dry or wet {{habitats}} but prefers moist slopes. <b>Wild</b> <b>Angelica</b> grows on grazing grounds, cultured land and along streams.|$|E
50|$|Rich {{wetlands}} occur {{especially at}} {{the east of the}} moors and have species mixes arising in part out of the effects of a limestone understratum dominated by purple moor-grass with, in less-grazed areas, bog-myrtle (Myrica gale), and in more-grazed areas, cross-leaved heath and tormentil, with sweet vernal-grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), Yorkshire fog (Holcus lanatus), compact rush (Juncus conglomeratus), sneezewort (Achillea ptramica), marsh thistle (Cirsium palustre) and <b>wild</b> <b>angelica</b> (Angelica sylvestris), and limestone indicators including carnation, glaucous and flea sedges (Carex panicea, C. flacca and C. pulicaris), fen bedstraw (Galium uliginosum), tufted vetch (Vicia cracca) and moss (Hylocomium splendens).|$|E
50|$|Unlike other swallowtails which specialise on Rutaceae, {{this species}} mostly feeds on plants of family Umbelliferae, females laying eggs singly. Milk parsley (also known as marsh hog's fennel) is {{normally}} the only food plant {{used by the}} caterpillars of the British subspecies. The food plants of the swallowtail in Europe, Asia, and North America are more varied than in the UK. It uses {{a wide variety of}} umbellifers including wild carrot (Daucus carota), <b>wild</b> <b>angelica</b> (Angelica sylvestris), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), and hogweeds (Heracleum). In the Maltese Islands, the caterpillar feeds on plants such as rue (Ruta chalepensis) in addition to Umbelliferae such as fennel.|$|E
50|$|The Saxon wasp plays a {{vital role}} in the ecosystem. Adult Saxon wasps can feed on a variety of things, {{including}} the nectar of many plants. Therefore, the species can benefit agriculture when they collect the nectar by unknowingly pollinating many plants. For example, queens pollinate bilberry flowers in the spring, while workers and males pollinate <b>wild</b> <b>angelica,</b> wild parsnip, and hogweed blossom flowers towards the end of summer. Saxon wasps can also decrease populations of insects, such as flies, since the larvae are fed on them. Perhaps more importantly, insects like the Saxon wasp can transport and recycle organic and inorganic matter, such as cadmium, iron, lead, and zinc. This is especially important due to the increasing amounts of environmental pollution due to chemical and industrial industries.|$|E
