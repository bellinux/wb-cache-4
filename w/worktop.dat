2500|$|Unit {{construction}} {{since its}} introduction has defined {{the development of}} the modern kitchen. Pre-manufactured modules, using mass manufacturing techniques developed during World War II, greatly brought down the cost of a kitchen. Units which are kept on the floor are called [...] "floor units", [...] "floor cabinets", or [...] "base cabinets" [...] on which a kitchen <b>worktop</b> – originally often formica and often now made of granite, marble, tile or wood – is placed. The units which are held on the wall for storage purposes are termed as [...] "wall units" [...] or [...] "wall cabinets". In small areas of kitchen in an apartment, even a [...] "tall storage unit" [...] is available for effective storage. In cheaper brands, all cabinets are kept a uniform color, normally white, with interchangeable doors and accessories chosen by the customer to give a varied look. In more expensive brands, the cabinets are produced matching the doors' colors and finishes, for an older more bespoke look.|$|E

40|$|IKEA {{was founded}} in 1943 by Ingvar Kamprad and is {{currently}} retailing in 44 different countries around the globe. With the implementation of 25 year warranty the importance to validate the quality have increased to satisfy the customer. The aim of this thesis have therefore been {{to find out the}} critical factors for kitchen <b>worktops</b> through the expectations of the customers. In addition to this the product development process was investigated to gain an understanding on how IKEA deals with customer complaints today. The thesis was divided in four stages. First the customers’ expectations were investigated by using the survey research method. The formulations of the questions are of great importance in this research method so that the information needed can be gathered without confusion and irritation. The critical factors of the kitchen <b>worktops</b> were also located in this survey and are out of the customer point of view. After the survey was done and the critical factors identified a concept generation phase was started to analyze possible ways of solving the issues with the kitchen <b>worktops.</b> Three proposals of concepts was generated; improvement in quality, improvement in the information communicated by IKEA, and a combination of these two. These proposals were analyzed against each other, against the survey and against the possible concrete gains. When the proposals of concepts were completed a decision to investigate the product development process was made and suggestions on how these critical factors could be found earlier in the process were made. Lastly a proposal of a database system for categorizations of the customer complaints when it comes to different defects were made and proposed to IKEA. Out from the information received by the survey these proposals could be made and the conclusion that scratches and to some extent heat was the most critical flaws, which would be the thing to focus further on. The product development process could also be improved to make it possible to take notice of these critical flaws earlier in the process. To summarize the project was successful and IKEA was really happy with the results, and the extra tasks that were added to this thesis. The first problem description was to only find the customers’ expectations but to get something out of this we added the proposals and the attempt to change the product development process when it comes to kitchen <b>worktops...</b>|$|R
50|$|Hard ground can {{be applied}} in two ways. Solid hard ground comes in a hard waxy block. To apply hard ground of this variety, the plate to be etched is placed upon a {{hot-plate}} (set at 70 degrees C), a kind of metal <b>worktop</b> that is heated up. The plate heats up and the ground is applied by hand, melting onto the plate as it is applied. The ground is spread over the plate as evenly as possible using a roller. Once applied the etching plate {{is removed from the}} hot-plate and allowed to cool which hardens the ground.|$|E

As different filters are required for different materials, recirculating fume hoods should only be used when the hazard is well known and does not change.|$|E
