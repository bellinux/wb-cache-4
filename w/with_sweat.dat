5|$|The Wrestlers is an oil {{painting}} on millboard by English artist William Etty, painted around 1840 and {{currently in the}} York Art Gallery. It depicts a wrestling match between a black man and a white man, both glistening <b>with</b> <b>sweat</b> and under an intense light emphasising their curves and musculature. While little documentation of the painting exists prior to 1947, {{it is likely that}} it was painted over a period of three evenings at the life class of the Royal Academy.|$|E
5|$|The {{identity}} of the wrestlers is not known. Alison Smith, Lead Curator of British Art to 1900 at Tate, speculates that the white figure may have been John Wilton of Somerset, who had possibly been the model for Little John in Daniel Maclise's 1839 Robin Hood and His Merry Men Entertaining Richard the Lionheart in Sherwood Forest. The figures glisten <b>with</b> <b>sweat.</b> Art historian Sarah Victoria Turner speculates {{that this is not}} simply for dramatic effect, but reflects the fact that after the Royal Academy's 1837 move to its new building in Trafalgar Square the studio used by the life class was a cramped and poorly ventilated room lit by gaslight, which when crowded with students and with the lights on could become extremely hot.|$|E
5|$|Since {{its initial}} release, Wolfenstein 3D has been ported to {{numerous}} other platforms. These include the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (1994), Mac OS (1994), Atari Jaguar (1994), Acorn Archimedes (1994), 3DO (1995), Apple IIGS (1998), and PC-98 (1998). The Super NES and Jaguar ports {{were developed by}} id, while the rest were produced by other companies. Later releases include the Game Boy Advance (2002), Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, and an iOS version programmed by Carmack himself (2009). These ports' sound, graphics, and levels sometimes differ from the original—the Super NES version notably replaced the blood <b>with</b> <b>sweat,</b> dogs with rats, and removed all Nazi references, although the core gameplay and aesthetic are retained. Many of the ports include only the Apogee episodes, but the iOS port includes Spear of Destiny, and a 2007 Steam release for PC, OS X, and Linux includes all of the FormGen episodes. Bethesda Softworks, whose parent company bought id Software in 2009, celebrated the 20th anniversary of Wolfenstein 3Ds release by producing a free-to-play browser-based version {{of the game in}} 2012.|$|E

50|$|Sebaceous {{hyperplasia}} is {{a disorder}} of the sebaceous glands {{in which they}} become enlarged, producing flesh-colored or yellowish, shiny, often umbilicated bumps on the face.

25|$|The concert footage {{was shot}} on August 2 and August 3 during the Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003 at Reliant Stadium in Houston, Texas, and Texas Stadium in Irving, Texas. The video footage {{is made up}} of the audio from the Dallas show and video from both the Houston and Dallas shows; because of this the band had to wear the same clothes on two shows, {{although}} there are still noticeable differences. For example, {{it can be seen that}} Mike Shinoda wears two similar but different shirts, Brad Delson's guitar sometimes changes multiple times in the middle of songs from a red PRS to a black Ibanez, Dave Farrell's basses change a few times as well in the middle of songs, as well as lead singer Chester Bennington's shirt soaked <b>with</b> <b>sweat,</b> and it being completely dry the next time he is shown on screen.|$|E
25|$|Based on the concept, for the {{majority}} Rouvas represents the dark and erotic side of the video, while Tamta the light and innocence. The video begins {{with the image of}} a man in shadows spinning on a chair and holding his head with his hand. It then forwards to a scene with Tamta, wearing leopard print lingerie, looking in a mirror and getting dressed, continuously alternating between these two scenes, while lights flash constantly. As the first verse begins, the shadowy figure is revealed to be Rouvas, <b>with</b> <b>sweat</b> dripping heavily down his face and an unidentified female hand touching him. A new scene is added with Tamta {{standing in front of a}} white background with the wind blowing, wearing various loose, flowy costumes, one of which is a Laskaris Haute Couture creation. The scenes constantly alternate between a single frame to a grid. Throughout the video Tamta wears five different costumes. It was also the first music video where Tamta can be seen with her new look.|$|E
25|$|The fast-fashion brands are not {{the only}} one who involve <b>with</b> <b>sweat</b> factories. The German {{sportswear}} giant, Adidas, was blamed for Indonesian sweatshops in 2000 (Osborn, 2000). Adidas was subjected to the issues of underpayment, overtime working, physical abuse and child labour. Another sportswear giant, Nike, is recently facing a heavy wave of anti-sweatshops protests in the US. They are organised by the United Student Against Sweatshops (USAS) and were held in Boston, Washington D.C., Bangalore and San Pedro Sula. They claimed that workers in Nike’s contract factory in Vietnam are suffering from wage theft, verbal abuse and harsh working conditions with ‘temperatures over the legal limit of 90 degrees’(Bain, 2017). Since the 1990s, Nike was reported of employing sweat factories and child labour. Regardless of its effort to turn things around, Nike’s image has been affected by the issue during the past two decades. Nike established an independent department which aimed to improve workers’ life in 1996. It was renamed as Fair Labor Association in 1999 and is a non-profit organisation which includes representatives from companies, human right and labour unions to work on monitoring and management of labour rights (Nisen, 2013). To improve its brand image of being immoral, Nike has been publishing annual sustainable business reports since 2001(Project Just, 2016) and annual corporate social responsibility report continuously since 2005, mentioning its commitments, standards and audit (Nisen, 2013).Yet, the issue of sweatshops continues to bother Nike. Similar stories are still heard in the fashion industry in the past decades.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{majority}} of patients with cholinergic urticaria presents with strong hypersensitivity to autologous <b>sweat.</b> Patients <b>with</b> severe cholinergic urticaria are frequently resistant to H 1 antagonists which are used in conventional therapies for various types of urticaria. It {{has been reported that}} desensitization using partially purified sweat antigen was effective in a patient with cholinergic urticaria. Methods: The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the usefulness of rapid desensitization <b>with</b> autologous <b>sweat</b> in severe cholinergic urticaria, because rapid desensitization has proven to be a quick and effective immunotherapy for allergies to various allergens. Six patients with severe cholinergic urticaria who are resistant to H 1 antagonists and have sweat hypersensitivity were enrolled in a rapid desensitization protocol. Results: In all six patients, the responses for skin tests <b>with</b> autologous <b>sweat</b> were attenuated after rapid desensitization <b>with</b> autologous <b>sweat.</b> Two of the three cholinergic urticaria patients showed reduced histamine release <b>with</b> autologous <b>sweat</b> after the rapid desensitization <b>with</b> autologous <b>sweat.</b> Further, the rapid desensitization and subsequent maintenance treatment reduced the symptoms in five of the six patients. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that rapid desensitization <b>with</b> autologous <b>sweat</b> is beneficial for treating cholinergic urticaria patients resistant to conventional therapy who have sweat hypersensitivity...|$|R

2500|$|On stage 12 of the 1955 Tour, {{the riders}} went over Mount Ventoux. Ten {{kilometres}} from the summit, said the journalist Jacques Augendre, French rider Jean Malléjac was: [...] "Streaming <b>with</b> <b>sweat,</b> haggard and comatose, he was zigzagging {{and the road}} wasn't wide enough for him... He was already {{no longer in the}} real world, still less in the world of cyclists and the Tour de France." [...] Malléjac collapsed, falling to the ground with one foot still trapped in a pedal. The other leg pedalled on in the air. He was, said Pierre Chany, [...] "completely unconscious, his face the colour of a corpse, a freezing sweat ran on his forehead.|$|E

The seam on a new ball is prominent, and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner. During matches, the quality of the ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable, and {{during the course of this}} deterioration its behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the match. Players will therefore attempt to modify the ball's behaviour by modifying its physical properties. Polishing the ball and wetting it <b>with</b> <b>sweat</b> or saliva is legal, even when the polishing is deliberately done on one side only to increase the ball's swing through the air, but the acts of rubbing other substances into the ball, scratching the surface or picking at the seam is illegal ball tampering.|$|E
2500|$|The school's outdoor {{program was}} news on several occasions.

[...] In 1976, Ted Milligan collapsed with hypothermia two miles from the school while on a voluntary training run for the [...] "Interschool Snowshoe Race" [...] held annually between the Manitoba and Alberta schools. The day started out warm, but at sunset, the temperature dropped rapidly. Milligan's clothes were soaked <b>with</b> <b>sweat,</b> and he chilled. Initially he was thought dead, with no detectable pulse by the school's nurse. He was unresponsive to resuscitation efforts. At the Selkirk Hospital, doctors heated up the ER and wisely placed an ice pack on his head to prevent thermal shock to his brain. In time, he was revived and was awake and alert the following morning.|$|E

2500|$|Opinions vary as to French's {{military}} abilities. Edward Spears, then a subaltern liaising between French and Lanrezac, {{later wrote}} of the former: [...] "You only {{had to look at}} him to see that he was a brave, determined man ... I learnt to love and to admire the man who never lost his head, and on whom danger had the effect it has on the wild boar: he would become morose, furious for a time, harsh, but he would face up and never shirk. He knew only one way of dealing with a difficulty, and that was to tackle it ... If he had once lost confidence in a man, justly or unjustly, that man could do no right in his eyes. He was as bad an enemy as he was a good friend ... once he had lost confidence in (Lanrezac) he ignored him and acted as if he and his Army did not exist." [...] Spears also recorded that at a conference with Joffre on 30 August 1914 French, the back of his tunic wet <b>with</b> <b>sweat</b> from riding hard to reach the meeting, was [...] "one of the coolest and calmest people at GHQ". This was at the time when he had decided that the BEF would have to retreat behind the Seine to refit.|$|E
