25|$|Two {{hypothesis}} {{tests are}} particularly widely used. First, one <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> the estimated regression equation is {{any better than}} simply predicting that all values of the response variable equal its sample mean (if not, {{it is said to}} have no explanatory power). The null hypothesis of no explanatory value of the estimated regression is tested using an F-test. If the calculated F-value is found to be large enough to exceed its critical value for the pre-chosen level of significance, the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis, that the regression has explanatory power, is accepted. Otherwise, the null hypothesis of no explanatory power is accepted.|$|E
25|$|Without Kendall, Reese and Bianca {{exchange}} wedding vows on February 12, 2009. Ryan, however, {{has called}} off his wedding with Greenlee after seeing Zach and Reese kiss. He tells Greenlee {{that he knows}} Zach and Reese have been sleeping together and {{that he does not}} want to be married next to them, but promises her that he will give her the wedding of her dreams. Greenlee then tries to get in touch with Zach; she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> he has really been having an affair with Reese. When Greenlee cannot get in touch with Zach, she drives off on her motorcycle in search of him. Also on the road are Zach and Kendall in a car arguing. Kendall ends up in the wrong lane and nearly hits Greenlee. Both try to swerve out of the other's way, leaving Greenlee to drive off the road. When Greenlee's body is not found, she is presumed dead. Reese, Bianca and others soon find out about Greenlee being missing. Ryan tells Bianca that Zach and Reese have been engaging in a sexual relationship with each other. Bianca goes to Reese to tell her that their relationship and marriage is over. She later sends Reese annulment papers, and returns to Paris with Miranda and Gabrielle.|$|E
