500|$|On December 28, 2004, Mike Brown and {{his team}} {{discovered}} Haumea on images they had taken with the 1.3m SMARTS Telescope at the Palomar Observatory in the United States on May 6, 2004, while looking for <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>hoped</b> would be the tenth planet. The Caltech discovery team used the nickname [...] "Santa" [...] among themselves, because they had discovered Haumea on December 28, 2004, just after Christmas. However, it was clearly {{too small to be}} a planet, because it was significantly smaller than Pluto, and Brown did not announce the discovery. Instead he kept it under wraps, along with several other large trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs), pending additional observation to better determine their natures. When his team discovered Haumea's moons, they realized that Haumea was more rocky than other TNOs, and that its moons were mostly ice. They then discovered a small family of nearby icy TNOs, and concluded that these were remnants of Haumea's icy mantle, which had been blasted off by a collision. On July 7, 2005, while he was finishing the paper describing the discovery, Brown's daughter Lilah was born, which delayed the announcement further. On July 20, the Caltech team published an online abstract of a report intended to announce the discovery at a conference the following September. In this Haumea was given the code K40506A.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{during the}} 1950s and 1960s {{generally}} regarded the Elegy as powerful, and emphasised its place {{as one of}} the great English poems. In 1955, R. W. Ketton-Cremer argued, [...] "At the close of his greatest poem Gray was led to describe, simply and movingly, what sort of man he believed himself to be, how he had fared in his passage through the world, and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>hoped</b> for from eternity." [...] Regarding the status of the poem, Graham Hough in 1953 explained, [...] "no one has ever doubted, but many have been hard put to it to explain in what its greatness consists. It is easy to point out that its thought is commonplace, that its diction and imagery are correct, noble but unoriginal, and to wonder where the immediately recognizable greatness has slipped in." [...] Following in 1963, Martin Day argued that the poem was [...] "perhaps the most frequently quoted short poem in English." [...] Frank Brady, in 1965, declared, [...] "Few English poems have been so universally admired as Gray's Elegy, and few interpreted in such widely divergent ways." [...] Patricia Spacks, in 1967, focused on the psychological questions in the poem and claimed that [...] "For these implicit questions the final epitaph provides no adequate answer; perhaps this is one reason why it seems not entirely a satisfactory conclusion to the poem." [...] She continued by praising the poem: [...] "Gray's power as a poet derives largely from his ability to convey the inevitability and inexorability of conflict, conflict by its nature unresolvable." [...] In 1968, Herbert Starr pointed out that the poem was [...] "frequently referred to, with some truth, as the best known poem in the English language." ...|$|E
