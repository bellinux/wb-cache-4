In the film, Selena's real voice {{is used for the}} musical sequences in Selena, but Lopez would nonetheless sing the lyrics during the scenes instead of lip syncing. When asked in an interview if Selena inspired her to launch a music career, Lopez stated: [...] "I really, really became inspired, because I started my career in musical theater on stage. So doing the movie just reminded me of how much I missed singing, dancing, and the like..." [...] After filming Selena, Lopez was [...] "really feeling [...] Latin roots" [...] and cut a demo in Spanish. Lopez's manager then sent the song, entitled [...] "Vivir Sin Ti", to Sony Music Entertainment's Work Group, who showed an interest in signing Lopez. Tommy Mottola, the head of the label suggested to her that she sing in English instead. She complied and began recording her debut studio album On the 6. During production of the album, Lopez was {{aware of the fact that}} she received her recording contract on the premise of her looks and having an already established name in the entertainment industry, and wanted to prove that she had musical talent. Prior to the debut of her music, critics <b>wondered</b> <b>why</b> <b>she</b> would take the risk of launching a music career. It was noted that: [...] "If the album was a flop, not only would it embarrass Lopez, but it might even damage her career." ...|$|E
