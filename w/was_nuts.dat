It just got so overloaded; it <b>was</b> <b>nuts.</b> So he was smart enough to peel it all back, and he held voices back to the bridge, me at the top end, Carl in the middle and Brian on the bottom. At that point, Brian's right move was to get subtler. He had a very tender track here. 'God Only Knows' is a very small masterpiece with a major heartbeat, and he was right to peel everybody back and wind up with the three parts. In fact, it's probably the only well-known Beach Boys track that has just three voices on it." ...|$|E

Mr. Darwin invented [...] the theory that goes by that name, but the Ornithorhynchus was the [...] first to put it to actual experiment and prove {{that it could be}} [...] done. Hence it should have as much of the credit as Mr. Darwin. [...] It was never in the Ark; you will find no mention of it there; it [...] nobly stayed out and worked the theory. Of all creatures in the [...] world it was the only one properly equipped for the test. The Ark [...] was thirteen months afloat, and all the globe submerged; no land [...] visible above the flood, no vegetation, no food for a mammal to eat, [...] nor water for a mammal to drink; for all mammal food was destroyed, [...] and when the pure floods from heaven and the salt oceans of the [...] earth mingled their waters and rose above the mountain tops, the [...] result was a drink which no bird or beast of ordinary construction [...] could use and live.

On the whole, then, if asked my opinion on this affair, the Prophet would say--putting it ambiguous-like-- [...] "Gentlemen, when there's so much dirty linen to wash, can't you remember that we're all pretty much tarred with the same brush?" [...] A great politician--which a lot of his family is here, Coningsby, and the Young Duke, and many other sportsmen--used to say as what the Turf was [...] "a gigantic engine of national demoralisation;" [...] which Nicholas is not quite sure but what he was right for him, though his language on rather a large scale.

Why, gents all, which of us WOULDN'T do it, if he had the chance to put the pot on handsome, human nature being what it is, especially considering the lowness of the market odds as you have often and often to be content with.

What's here now? yes, faith, I lamented my birthday(9) two days after, and that's all: and you rhyme, Madam Stella; were those verses made upon my birthday? faith, when I read them, I had them running in my head all the day, and said them over a {{thousand}} times; they drank your health in all their glasses, and wished, etc. I could not {{get them out of}} my head. What? no, I believe it was not; what do I say upon the eighth of December? Compare, and see whether I say so. I am glad of Mrs. Stoyte's recovery, heartily glad; your Dolly Manley's and Bishop of Cloyne's(10) child I have no concern about: I am sorry in a civil way, that's all. Yes, yes, Sir George St. George dead.(11)--Go, cry, Madam Dingley; I have written to the Dean. Raymond will be rich, for he has the building itch. I wish all he has got may put him out of debt. Poh, I have fires like lightning; they cost me twelvepence a week, beside small coal. I have got four new caps, madam, very fine and convenient, with striped cambric, instead of muslin; so Patrick need not mend them, but take the old ones. Stella snatched Dingley's word out of her pen; Presto a cold? Why, all the world here is dead with them: I never had anything like it in my life; 'tis not gone in five weeks. I hope Leigh is with you before this, and has brought your box. How do you like the ivory rasp? Stella is angry; but I'll have a finer thing for her. Is not the apron as good? I'm sure I shall never be paid it; so all's well again.--What? the quarrel with Sir John Walter?(12) Why, we had not one word of quarrel; only he railed at me when I was gone: and Lord Keeper and Treasurer teased me for a week. It <b>was</b> <b>nuts</b> to them; a serious thing with a vengeance.--The Whigs may sell their estates then, or hang themselves, as they are disposed; for a peace there will be. Lord Treasurer told me that Connolly(13) was going to Hanover. Your Provost(14) is a coxcomb. Stella is a good girl for not being angry when I tell her of spelling; I see none wrong in this. God Almighty be praised that your disorder lessens; it increases my hopes mightily that they will go off. And have you been plagued with the fear of the plague? never mind those reports; I have heard them five hundred times. Replevi? Replevin, simpleton, 'tis Dingley I mean; but it is a hard word, and so I'll excuse it. I stated Dingley's accounts in my last. I forgot Catherine's sevenpenny dinner. I hope it was the beef-steaks; I'll call and eat them in spring; but Goody Stoyte must give me coffee, or green tea, for I drink no bohea. Well, ay, the pamphlet; but there are some additions to the fourth edition; the fifth edition was of four thousand, in a smaller print, sold for sixpence.
