500|$|The {{song was}} later added as a video {{interlude}} on The MDNA Tour in 2012, {{as a tribute}} to Tyler Clementi and other teens who had committed suicide due to bullying. The film, which was created by Swedish director Johan Söderberg, morphed Madonna's face with a number of famous figures, including then-Chinese President Hu Jintao, US Republican former presidential candidate Sarah Palin and Pope Benedict XVI. The face of French far right politician Marine Le Pen appeared on the screen with a swastika superimposed on her forehead, before it morphed into the face of Adolf Hitler. Le Pen was infuriated by the video, and threatened to sue Madonna should this happen during her concert in France on July 14, 2012, also known as Bastille Day, the French National Day. Socialist French government spokesperson Najat Vallaud-Belkacem had also expressed her disappointment. However, Madonna kept the video unchanged on this date, prompting Le Pen to file a lawsuit against her. A spokesman for Le Pen said a lawsuit for [...] "public insult" [...] would be lodged with the Paris courts in the next few days. Madonna responded to the lawsuit saying [...] "I know that I made a certain Marine Le Pen very angry with me. And it's not my intention to make enemies." [...] She later explained in an interview with Brazilian network Rede Globo, that the sequence was about [...] "intolerance that we human beings have for one another. And how much <b>we</b> <b>judge</b> people before knowing them. That's why it's done in the song 'Nobody Knows Me.'" [...] During her concert in Nice, France, the swastika was removed and was replaced by an interrogation mark.|$|E
500|$|The {{accepted}} view is {{that the}} main developments which differentiated the early dromons from the liburnians, and that henceforth characterized Mediterranean galleys, were the adoption of a full deck (katastrōma), the abandonment of the rams on the bow in favour of an above-water spur, and the gradual introduction of lateen sails. The exact reasons for the abandonment of the ram ( [...] ; , embolos) are unclear. Depictions of upward-pointing beaks in the 4th-century Vatican Vergil manuscript may well illustrate that the ram had already been replaced by a spur in late Roman galleys. One possibility is that the change occurred because of the gradual evolution of the ancient shell-first mortise and tenon hull construction method, against which rams had been designed, into the skeleton-first method, which produced a stronger and more flexible hull, less susceptible to ram attacks. Certainly by the early 7th century, the ram's original function had been forgotten, if <b>we</b> <b>judge</b> by Isidore of Seville's comments that they were used to protect against collision with underwater rocks. As for the lateen sail, various authors have in the past suggested that it was introduced into the Mediterranean by the Arabs, possibly with an ultimate origin in India. However, the discovery of new depictions and literary references in recent decades has led scholars to antedate the appearance of the lateen sail in the Levant to the late Hellenistic or early Roman period. Not only the triangular, but also the quadrilateral version were known, used for centuries (mostly on smaller craft) in parallel with square sails. Belisarius' invasion fleet of 533 was apparently at least partly fitted with lateen sails, making it probable that by the time the lateen had become the standard rig for the dromon, with the traditional square sail gradually falling from use in medieval navigation.|$|E

[...] Halo effect is characterized by the tendency to rate a person who is exceptionally strong in one area higher than deserved in other areas. It is the opposite of the Horns effect, where a person is rated as lower than deserved in other areas due to an extreme deficiency in a single discipline.
