Every time one of these stories comes up, like, say, Michael Jackson, when it's finally over I think, <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief,</b> now {{we can get back}} to real news. But we never do." [...] In March 2008, El Diario commented, [...] "But if doubts persist about cases involving missing Latinos, there are reasons why. These cases rarely receive the attention and resources we see given to other missing persons. The English language media, for example, appear to be focused on the stories of missing white women, such as with the disappearance of Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Cases of missing Latino and African-American women often remain faceless, if and when they are even covered." ...|$|E

60|$|She {{was waiting}} for that question. <b>What</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> that should have come among the first.|$|E
60|$|Alvina {{washed her}} hands. There {{was nothing to}} do with the water but throw it out of the door. Then she washed her face, thoroughly, in good hot water. <b>What</b> <b>a</b> blessed <b>relief!</b> She sighed as she dried herself.|$|R
60|$|After the sear {{and lifeless}} {{color of the}} fields and forests, <b>what</b> <b>a</b> welcome <b>relief</b> to Daren Lane were the freshened green, the dawning red, the tinging gold! The forest on the hill was soft and warm, and but for the gleams of autumn, would have showed some of the {{tenderness}} of spring. Down in the lowlands a sea of color waved under a blue, smoky, melancholy haze.|$|R
60|$|At {{last the}} bottom bundle was pitched up, {{and he got}} {{down on his knees}} to help scrape the loose wheat into baskets. <b>What</b> <b>a</b> sweet <b>relief</b> it was to kneel down, to release the fork and let the worn and {{cramping}} muscles settle into rest! A new note came into the driver's voice, a soothing tone, full of kindness and admiration for the work his team had done.|$|R
60|$|MRS HUSHABYE. Splendid! Oh, <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief!</b> I {{thought you}} were going to be broken-hearted. Never mind me. Damn him again.|$|E
6000|$|What a {{pity the}} {{government}} did not supply our men with wonderworkers during the South African campaign! <b>What</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> it would have been! ...|$|E
6000|$|The left soon followed; and Hal's next {{work was}} {{to remove the}} gag from his mouth. <b>What</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> it was to once more close his mouth! ...|$|E
60|$|I {{had made}} a start! I cannot tell you <b>what</b> <b>a</b> sense of <b>relief</b> was {{imparted}} {{to me by the}} simple fact that there was at least one spot within Pellucidar with a familiar name and a place upon a map.|$|R
5000|$|... "Oh Shama, {{this book}} is very {{valuable}} and efficacious, so I present it to you, you read it. Once I suffered intensely and My [...] heart began to palpitate and My life was in danger. At that critical time, I hugged this book to My heart and then, Shama, <b>what</b> [...] <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> it gave me! I thought that Allah Himself came down and saved Me. So I give this to you, read it slowly, little by [...] little, read daily one name at least and it will do you good." ...|$|R
6000|$|My cousin reflected. So {{that was}} what they {{considered}} to be everything! [...] "I wish I knew just where he stood," [...] he said at last, and followed Mrs. Bunting luncheonward. In {{the course of that}} meal, which was tête-à-tête, it became almost unsatisfactorily evident <b>what</b> <b>a</b> great <b>relief</b> Melville's consent to interview Chatteris was to Mrs. Bunting. Indeed, she seemed to consider herself relieved from the greater portion of her responsibility in the matter, since Melville was bearing her burden. She sketched out her defence against the accusations that had no doubt been levelled at her, explicitly and implicitly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Better go to sleep," [...] came in Zane's calm voice. <b>What</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> it was! [...] "We'll keep watch, an' {{at daybreak}} guide you to Fort Henry." ...|$|E
6000|$|Once {{more they}} {{went out into the}} {{blinding}} snow-storm. Lane threw back his head and breathed the cold air. <b>What</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> {{to get out of that}} stifling room! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Netta, {{how good}} of you!" [...] Hilda said, {{after she had}} sobbed for some time on her friend's shoulder. [...] "Oh, <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> it is to me!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's {{not likely}} I well know,' said Flora, 'but it's {{possible}} and being possible when I had the gratification of {{reading in the}} papers that you had arrived from Italy and were going back I {{made up my mind}} to try it for you might come across him or hear something of him and if so <b>what</b> <b>a</b> blessing and <b>relief</b> to all!' ...|$|R
60|$|How good {{it was to}} see his dear face once more! <b>What</b> <b>a</b> {{sense of}} <b>relief</b> came over me because he was near! I was yet so young as to believe that no harm could come to a fellow while his father was near, and on the moment all the fears which had been aroused by Bill Jepson passed out of mind.|$|R
6000|$|What evenings, {{when the}} candles came, and I was {{expected}} to employ myself, but, not daring to read an entertaining book, pored over some hard-headed, harder-hearted treatise on arithmetic; when the tables of weights and measures set themselves to tunes, as 'Rule Britannia', or 'Away with Melancholy'; when they wouldn't stand still to be learnt, but would go threading my grandmother's needle through my unfortunate head, in at one ear and out at the other! What yawns and dozes I lapsed into, {{in spite of all}} my care; what starts I came out of concealed sleeps with; what answers I never got, to little observations that I rarely made; <b>what</b> <b>a</b> blank space I seemed, which everybody overlooked, and yet was in everybody's way; <b>what</b> <b>a</b> heavy <b>relief</b> it was to hear Miss Murdstone hail the first stroke of nine at night, and order me to bed! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Just on there," [...] she said, [...] "then if I {{come into}} the room later, I can see it there at a glance; and oh! <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> it will be!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'O Frank, you can't think <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> {{that is to}} me. That dear, good, helpful, little lady--it {{really made}} me cry this morning when I thought how she had been used.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{will let}} me trust {{to you to}} tell me when I get too vehement? above all, when you see my temper failing? Thank you; you don't know <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> it is!' ...|$|E
40|$|I dialed {{room service}} at the Washington Hilton, knowing {{that if there was}} an answer, the {{threatened}} strike of the unionized hotel employees would have been settled––and there would be no problems for the Second World Congress of the World Federation of Nuclear Medicine and Biology (WFNMB) that was to begin in 2 hours. <b>What</b> <b>a</b> sigh of <b>relief</b> I breathed when the phone was answered. Preparations for the meeting began when Washington, DC, was selected for the 1978 meeting during the Firs...|$|R
60|$|Her head sunk again, and Beatrice stepped hastily {{back to the}} fire, with a more bitter feeling {{than she}} had ever known. This was no forgiveness; it was worse than anger or reproach; it was a repulse, and that when her whole heart was yearning to relieve the pent-up oppression that almost choked her, by weeping with her. She leant her burning {{forehead}} on the cool marble chimney-piece, and longed for her mother,--longed for her almost as much for her papa's, her Aunt Mary's and her grandmother's sake, as for her own. But O! <b>what</b> <b>an</b> infinite <b>relief</b> would one talk with her have been! She turned toward the table, and thought of writing to her, but her hand was trembling--every pulse throbbing; she could not even sit still enough to make the attempt.|$|R
60|$|Fain would {{others have}} been the same support; but his father, though not leaving him, was {{completely}} unnerved, and unable to do anything; and Mrs. Ponsonby was suffering under one of the attacks that were brought on by any sudden agitation. Mary, though giddy and throbbing in every pulse, was forced to put a resolute check on herself--brace her limbs, steady her voice, and keep her face composed, while every faculty was absorbed in listening for sounds from her cousin's room, and her heart was quivering with an anguish of prayer and suspense. Could she but hide her burning cheeks for one moment, let out one of the sobs that seemed to be rending her breast, throw herself on her knees and burst into tears, <b>what</b> <b>an</b> infinite <b>relief</b> it would be! But Mary had learnt to spend her life in having no self.|$|R
6000|$|... "How {{nice of you}} to {{come and}} tell me this," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "and <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief!</b> I am sure I think he is very {{fortunate}} to have made such good friends." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dick {{dropped his}} head upon his hands, {{somewhat}} {{ashamed of the}} smarting dimness in his eyes. He had not meant to say so much. Yet <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> to let out that long-congested burden! ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Flint smiled knowingly--but with an effort. <b>What</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> {{it would}} have been to him to charge horse and foot, to forget that he was a {{railroad}} president dealing with a potential power.|$|E
5000|$|... "But why {{attribute}} to God, the God whom neither time nor space limits, the same respect {{and love for}} order? Why forever speak of [...] "total unity"? If God loves men, what need has He to subordinate men to His divine will and to deprive them of their own will, the most precious of the things He has bestowed upon them? There is no need at all. Consequently, the idea of total unity is an absolutely false idea....It is not forbidden for reason to speak of unity and even of unities, but it must renounce total unity - and other things besides. And <b>what</b> <b>a</b> sigh of <b>relief</b> men will breathe when they suddenly discover that the living God, the true God, in no way resembles Him whom reason has shown them until now!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had to do}} it. She wished it, and, as she said, it was <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> to have us there, {{though she}} was wishing us {{at the ends of}} the earth all the time. But <b>what</b> <b>a</b> ghastly life!" ...|$|R
60|$|Mother, I {{have not}} felt well again {{the last two}} days as I was Tuesday, but I feel a good deal better this morning. I go round, {{but most of the time}} feel very little like it. The doctor tells me I have {{continued}} too long in the hospitals, especially in a bad place, Armory building, where the worst wounds were, and have absorbed too much of the virus in my system--but I know it is nothing but <b>what</b> <b>a</b> little <b>relief</b> and sustenance of [the] right sort will set right. I am writing this in Major Hapgood's office. He is very busy paying off some men whose time is out; they are going home to New York. I wrote to George yesterday. We are having very pleasant weather here just now. Mother, you didn't mention whether Mary had come, so I suppose she has not. I should like to see her and Ansel too. The wounded still come here in large numbers--day and night trains of ambulances. Tell Jeff the $10 from Mr. Lane for the soldiers came safe. I shall write to Jeff right away. I send my love to Mat and all. Mother, you must try to keep good heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I {{may bring}} my luggage in and send that cabman away?" [...] Anna asked. [...] "Dear me, <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief!</b> If I had had any nerves that {{man would have}} trampled upon them long ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{raised his}} head, strode forward, and grasped my hand. [...] "Forgive me, Cumberledge," [...] he cried. [...] "But a proscribed and hounded man! If you knew <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> {{it is to}} {{me to get out}} on the water!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Thank God, I {{have done}} {{half the number}} with great care, and hope to finish on Thursday or Friday next. O how thankful I feel {{to be able to}} have done it, and <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> to get the number out! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That I do, now,' said John; her delicate, respectful sympathy so {{opening his}} heart, that <b>what</b> had been <b>an</b> effort became <b>a</b> <b>relief.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "And <b>what</b> <b>a</b> house, Mrs. Delamayn! Historical {{associations}} {{in every corner}} of it! It is such <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> to my mind to take refuge in the past. When I am far away from this sweet place I shall people Swanhaven with its departed inmates, and share the joys and sorrows of centuries since." ...|$|R
60|$|Well, it's <b>a</b> <b>relief</b> to be alone. But say, this is high up! And <b>what</b> <b>a</b> noise! <b>What</b> is it they're {{doing out}} there, away {{out in the}} air, with all that clatter--building a steel building, I guess. Well, those fellers have their nerve, all right. I'll sit further back from the window.|$|R
