5|$|Football on the Pacific Coast {{had been}} on the rise since the late 1910s. Early in 1922, Warner signed a {{contract}} with Stanford University in which he would begin coaching in 1924 (after his contract with Pitt expired). Health concerns, a significant pay raise and the rising status of Pacific Coast football made Warner make the big change. Years later, he wrote:I felt my health would be better on the Pacific coast. Weather conditions at Pittsburgh during the football season are rather disagreeable, and much of the late season work had to be done upon a field which was ankle deep in mud. At the close of every season I would be in poor physical condition, twice being rendered incapable of coaching while I recuperated in a hospital. Doctors advised me that the climate of the Pacific coast <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> for a man of my age and in the work in which I was engaged.|$|E
25|$|Rodriguez-Trias's {{mother was}} a school teacher in Puerto Rico. However, in New York, she {{was not able to}} get a teacher's license because, at that time, {{bilingualism}} was considered a handicap. Therefore, her mother had to take in boarders in order to meet her financial needs and to pay the rent. After Rodriguez-Trias graduated from high school, she decided that she would like to study medicine and that her chances <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> in Puerto Rico, because the island had a good scholarship system.|$|E
25|$|Hubert {{made his}} first Winston Cup race in his first attempt with Jim Wilson's #78 team at Sears Point during the 1997 season. He would bring the #78 Hanes / Diamond Rio Ford home in the 28th position, one lap down. His next start would come in 1998 with the #19 team owned by Kurt Roehrig. He {{qualified}} an impressive 10th in his second race at Sears Point, however the #19 Bradford White Ford would finish 41st after a transmission failure 78 laps into the race. His second start during the 1998 season would come at Watkins Glen with Dan Marino and Bill Elliott's #13 team. Hubert drove the #13 FirstPlus Financial Ford to a 36th-place finish. He would return to Roehrig's team in 1999 for three races. His first start would come at Las Vegas where he qualified fourth, finishing in the 28th position. Again, Hubert raced at Sears Point where he would finish in the 33rd position, one lap down. He also attempted the Pepsi 400 at Michigan, however {{he was unable to}} qualify. In 2000, he would make one start with Penske Racing and the #12 Mobil 1 Ford. He would finish the Global Crossing @ The Glen in 33rd place after starting 16th. In 2001, Hubert qualified Buckshot Jones' #44 Georgia Pacific Dodge for the Dodge/Save Mart 350. In 2002, he would race the Sirius Satellite Radio at the Glen for Bill Davis Racing. Hubert finished the #23 Hills Brothers Coffee Dodge in the 24th position after starting 40th. He would return to the series in 2004 with Kirk Shelmerdine Racing, driving each of the road courses. At the newly renamed Infineon Raceway (formerly Sears Point Raceway) he would finish 43rd in the #72 Freddie B's Ford after running five laps at too slow of a pace for NASCAR. The Watkins Glen <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> for Hubert as he would finish in the 29th position just one lap down. He would return to Shelmerdine's team for 2005 and attempt each of the road courses. He would make the race at Infineon, however he finished 43rd after oil pressure problems. Hubert would not make the Sirius at The Glen after qualifying was rained out. Hubert again raced for Shelmerdine in 2006 for the Dodge/Save Mart 350, but was swept up in a crash on the opening lap and once more finished last.|$|E

She followed that up in 2002, by starring in the straight-to-DVD horror film American Psycho 2 alongside William Shatner, a sequel to the 2000 film American Psycho. American Psycho 2 was panned by critics, and later, Kunis herself expressed embarrassment over the film. In 2004, Kunis starred in the film adaptation Tony n' Tina's Wedding. Although the film was shot in 2004, {{it did not have}} a theatrical release until 2007. Most critics did not like the film, which mustered a 25% approval from Rotten Tomatoes. DVD talk concluded that [...] "fans <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> off pretending the movie never happened in the first place".|$|E
500|$|Some UN {{aid workers}} {{immediately}} criticized the operation, arguing that very sick children were poorly served by programmes that obliged them to travel hundreds of miles. They argued, too, that with costs of around Â£100,000 per evacuated child the programme was devouring funds {{that could have}} been used to improve local facilities and treatment. The head of Kosevo Hospital's plastic surgery department said [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> if you sent the tools to do our jobs properly than for you to make a big show of a few token evacuations." [...] Countering this, A.D.

500|$|The National Congress of Brazil {{passed a}} large naval {{acquisition}} program on 14 December 1904, {{but it was}} two years before any ships were ordered or purchased, and while Rio Branco suggested purchasing used warships to fill the gap, nothing came of it. By 1906, two factions had developed over which types of ships should be ordered. One, supported by the British armament company Armstrong Whitworth (which eventually received the order), favored a navy centered on a small number of large warships. The other, supported by Rio Branco, preferred a larger navy composed of smaller warships. Rio Branco, in support of this measure, stated that [...] "with six small battleships we <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>better.</b> If we lost one or two in combat, there would be still four or five left to fight with. But with three ? With two damaged or destroyed, we would be left with one only." ...|$|E

The remastered version premiered at the 2017 Game Developers Conference, where Schafer presented a remaking of a magazine pack-in demo that included recorded lines that had not {{be included in the}} full game. Schafer said that fans had been critical of Full Throttles relatively short length of about eight hours compared to other LucasArts games at the time which could take up to 40 hours. However, as he worked at the remaster, player expectations have changed, and he felt that Full Throttle <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> suited at its length in 2017, comparing it to other fully polished, short games like Inside.|$|E
2500|$|According to Ford, he and Brezhnev [...] "got along well...from {{the moment}} we met". Their small talk touched on their mutual {{previous}} experiences as sportsmen, as Ford and Brezhnev had played American football and association football, respectively. The heads of state also began to discuss policy on the train and, according to Kissinger, Brezhnev was at first surprised by Ford's [...] "straight to the point" [...] style because it differed so much from Nixon's more familiar [...] "elliptical approach". Brezhnev then began making points on arms control, the Middle East, and the European Security Conference before he made an emotional appeal that struck to [...] "the heart of the Cold War dilemma": according to Kissinger, he lamented {{the amount of money}} both the Soviet Union and the United States were spending on the arms race, calling it [...] "billions that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> spent {{for the benefit of the}} people". While Kissinger appreciated Brezhnev's [...] "ruminations", he believed Ford was uninterested in [...] "the general philosophy of arms control" [...] and rather preferred to [...] "discuss these issues in specific terms".|$|E
