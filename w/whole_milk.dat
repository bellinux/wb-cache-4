The negative association with iron status led to recommending the introduction of formula feeding in infancy during the weaning period or when breastfeeding ceased. More recently, the literature suggests that consuming <b>whole</b> cow's <b>milk</b> in infancy has unfortunate effects on growth, especially weight acceleration and development of overweight in childhood. These issues are discussed in the following chapter. Other suggested reasons for the avoidance of <b>whole</b> cow's <b>milk</b> in infancy are touched upon, such as milk protein allergy and high renal solute load. The hypothesis about early cow's milk introduction in the pathology of certain diseases, mainly through the peptide β-casomorphin- 7, is briefly reviewed, showing that there is no clear evidence for the suggested associations. The chapter gives a recent example of introducing formula at 6 months of age instead of <b>whole</b> cow's <b>milk</b> in infants' diet in Iceland.

50|$|<b>Whole</b> cow's <b>milk</b> {{contains}} {{too little}} iron, retinol, vitamin E, vitamin C, vitamin D, unsaturated fats or {{essential fatty acids}} for human babies. <b>Whole</b> cow's <b>milk</b> also contains too much protein, sodium, potassium, phosphorus and chloride which may put a strain on an infant's immature kidneys. In addition, the proteins, fats and calcium in <b>whole</b> cow's <b>milk</b> are more difficult for an infant to digest and absorb than the ones in breast milk. Evaporated milk may be easier to digest due to the processing of the protein but is still nutritionally inadequate. Some infants are allergic to cow's milk protein, this problem {{may be associated with}} infant formulas derived from cow's milk.|$|R
40|$|Early {{introduction}} of <b>whole</b> cow’s <b>milk</b> {{may lead to}} iron deficiency anemia. From a nutritional point of view, {{it is best to}} delay the {{introduction of}} <b>whole</b> cow’s <b>milk</b> until the infant is one year old. While {{there is no evidence to}} suggest adverse clinical sequelae associated with the increased renal solute load in healthy infants, feeding with <b>whole</b> cow’s <b>milk</b> would narrow the margin of safety in situations that may lead to dehydration. Early exposure to cow’s milk proteins increases the risk of developing allergy to milk proteins. Because of the possible association between early exposure to cow’s milk proteins and risk for type 1 diabetes mellitus, breast-feeding and avoidance of commercially available cow’s milk and products containing intact cow’s milk protein during the first year of life are strongly encouraged in families with a strong history of insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. The authors suggest that the optimal food in infancy is human breast milk. If human milk is not available, it is preferred that iron-fortified formulas rather than <b>whole</b> cow’s <b>milk</b> be used during the first year of life...|$|R

40|$|Milk fat {{globules}} {{are unique}} delivery systems for biologically active molecules in the gastrointestinal tract. However, their properties {{have not yet}} been fully investigated. In this study, we performed a comparative analysis of the polar lipid and fatty acid compositions of milk fat globules as a function of their size and investigated the structure of the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM). An optimised process of microfiltration was used to select the small milk fat globule (SMFG; 1. 6 lm) fractions and the large milk fat globule (LMFG; 6. 6 lm) fractions from the same initial <b>whole</b> <b>milks</b> (4. 2 lm). The SMFG-fractions contained significantly (i) higher amounts of polar lipids, 8. 9 ± 0. 9 vs 2. 7 ± 0. 3 mg/g fat for LMFG-fractions and 6. 3 ± 0. 5 mg/g fat for <b>whole</b> <b>milks,</b> (ii) lower relative proportions of phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin in the MFGM, (iii) higher amounts of C 12 : 0, C 14 : 0, C 16 : 0, C 18 : 1 trans, C 18 : 2 c 9 tr 11, and lower amounts of C 18 : 0 and C 18 : 1 c 9 than did LMFG-fractions and <b>whole</b> <b>milks.</b> Whatever the size of native milk fat globules, the biophysical characterisation performed in-situ, using confocal laser scanning microscopy, showed heterogeneities in the MFGM. The lateral segregation of sphingomyelin in rigid liquid-ordered domains, surrounded by the fluid matrix of glycerophospholipids in the liquid-disordered phase, was revealed. The heterogeneous distribution of glycolipids and glycoproteins was also observed in the MFGM. A new model for the structure of the MFGM is proposed and discussed.

40|$|The 13 C Octanoic acid {{breath test}} (OABT) {{was used to}} measure the rate of gastric {{emptying}} of <b>whole</b> goat's <b>milk</b> (WG), <b>whole</b> cow's <b>milk</b> (WC), goat's milk infant formula (GIF) and cow's milk infant formula (CIF) in healthy, adult men. Prior to the gastric emptying study, the integrity of the vacuum in two commonly used gas collection tubes was tested. The experiment showed that the Exetainer® brand of tube was more suitable for collecting expired air compared to the Vacutainer® brand {{based on the fact that}} it had less residual dead-space which could dilute expired air samples. Fifteen healthy men were given one of the four test milks containing 100 μg 13 C octanoic acid after an overnight fast. Breath samples were collected at regular intervals for four hours. Following analysis by ratio isotope mass spectrometry, gastric emptying parameters were calculated. The gastric emptying half time (t 1 / 2) of CIF was significantly shorter (P< 0. 05) than that of GIF (120 min vs. 159 min), but there were no differences in the rate of emptying between WC (141 min) and WG (150 min). There were no significant differences between either of the infant formulas and the <b>whole</b> <b>milks.</b> Blood samples were taken concurrently with the expired air samples. The samples were analysed to determine plasma glucose concentration. The results of showed that the timing of the peaks of plasma glucose levels and subsequent drop to below baseline concentration may be associated with the rate of gastric emptying. The manner in which the four test milks coagulated was also tested. Milks were incubated in vitro at 37. 5 °C after acidification with l molar HCl (to gastric pH 3) and addition of the enzyme pepsin. Vastly different coagulation properties were observed. The WC formed large curds with a clear separation between the whey-containing liquid and the curd whereas the WG and GIF were more homogenous with finer curds and considerably less clear fluid. The CIF exhibited very fine curds. Differences in composition between <b>whole</b> goat's <b>milk</b> and <b>whole</b> cow's <b>milk</b> did not appear to be sufficient to elicit different rates of gastric emptying.

25|$|Until the 19th century, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of butter was made by hand, on farms. The first butter factories appeared in the United States in the early 1860s, after the successful introduction of cheese factories a decade earlier. In the late 1870s, the centrifugal cream separator was introduced, marketed most successfully by Swedish engineer Carl Gustaf Patrik de Laval. This dramatically sped up the butter-making process by eliminating the slow step of letting cream naturally rise to the top of milk. Initially, <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> was shipped to the butter factories, and the cream separation took place there. Soon, though, cream-separation technology became small and inexpensive enough to introduce an additional efficiency: the separation was accomplished on the farm, and the cream alone shipped to the factory. By 1900, more than half the butter produced in the United States was factory made; Europe followed suit shortly after.|$|E
25|$|The {{milling of cereals}} {{results in}} {{considerable}} loss (up to 60%) of vitamin B2, so white flour is enriched in some countries such as US by addition of the vitamin. The enrichment of bread and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals contributes significantly to the dietary supply of vitamin B2. Polished rice is not usually enriched, because the vitamin’s yellow color would make the rice visually unacceptable to the major rice-consumption populations. However, most of the flavin content of whole brown rice is retained if the rice is steamed (parboiled) prior to milling. This process drives the flavins in the germ and aleurone layers into the endosperm. Free riboflavin is naturally present in foods along with protein-bound FMN and FAD. Bovine milk contains mainly free riboflavin, with a minor contribution from FMN and FAD. In <b>whole</b> <b>milk,</b> 14% of the flavins are bound noncovalently to specific proteins. in Bovine Milk: its concentration, distribution, and binding linkage, J. Nutr. Sci.

25|$|Rice (vary) is the {{cornerstone}} of the Malagasy diet and is typically consumed at every meal. The accompaniment served with rice is called laoka in the highlands dialect, the official version of the Malagasy language. Laoka are most often served in some kind of sauce: in the highlands, this sauce is generally tomato-based, while in coastal areas coconut milk is often added during cooking. In the arid southern and western interior where herding zebu is traditional, fresh or curdled zebu milk is often incorporated into vegetable dishes. Laoka are diverse and may include such ingredients as Bambara groundnuts with pork, beef or fish; trondro gasy (freshwater fish); ravitoto (shredded cassava leaves) with peanuts, beef or pork; henan'omby (beef) or akoho (chicken) sauteed with ginger and garlic or simmered in its own juices (a preparation called ritra); various types of seafood, which are more readily available along the coasts or in large urban centers; and many more. A variety of local greens such as anamamy (Morelle greens), anamafaitra (Martin greens) and particularly anamalao (paracress)—distinguished by the mildly analgesic effect the boiled leaves and flowers produce—are commonly sold alongside anandrano (watercress) and anatsonga (bok choy). In the arid south and west, such as among the Bara or Tandroy peoples, staples include sweet potato, yams, taro root and especially cassava, millet and maize, generally boiled in water and occasionally served in <b>whole</b> <b>milk</b> or flavored with crushed peanuts. Ro (broth) may be served as the main laoka or in addition to it to flavor and moisten the rice.|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether the prenatal maternal environment in dairy cattle influences the postnatal milking {{performance of the}} resulting daughters and grand-daughters. Linear mixed models were used to analyse <b>whole</b> season <b>milk</b> production from ∼ 46, 000 Jersey and ∼ 123, 000 Holstein Friesian cows in their 1 st and 2 nd lactations. Variation in the prenatal environment {{was associated with a}} small but significant (P< 0. 05) proportion of the total phenotypic variation (0. 010 to 0. 015) in all traits in Holstein Friesian cows and in the first lactation milk volume (0. 011) and milk protein (0. 011), and the second lactation milk fat (0. 015) in the Jersey breed. This indicates that the prenatal environment does influence the adult performance of the subsequent daughter. Associations between daughter performance and dam and grand-dam traits indicative of their prenatal environment were also estimated. A one litre increase in the dam's herd test milk volume was associated with a 7. 5 litre increase in the daughters' <b>whole</b> season <b>milk</b> yield and a 1 % increase in either the dams' herd test milk fat or protein percentage was associated with a reduction in daughter <b>whole</b> season <b>milk</b> volume (- 49. 6 and - 45. 0 litres for dam fat and protein, respectively).
