5|$|Figures from WRAP {{revealed}} {{the most efficient}} method of collecting food waste to be separate collections, followed by mixed green and food waste on a weekly basis. A mixed fortnightly collection was shown {{to be the worst}} performing. This was considered confirmation of earlier suspicions that, if carried out correctly, separate collections can result in less wastage of biodegradable waste. A widespread pilot scheme for separate food <b>waste</b> <b>collection,</b> involving nineteen English local authorities, achieved success and 'high levels of satisfaction' from households.|$|E

5|$|Early garbage {{collection}} in Scarborough {{was performed by}} individual communities and dumped in local landfills which were located in nearby ravines. In 1967 <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> was reorganized. Local landfills were closed {{and most of the}} garbage was directed to a new landfill on Beare Road in eastern Scarborough. This dump was eventually closed in 1981. A waste transfer site was constructed near Markham Road and Sheppard Avenue East. From there garbage was trucked to the Keele Valley dump in Vaughan and the Brock Road dump in Pickering. In 2002 the Keele Valley landfill was closed. As part of Toronto's overall waste management, garbage was then trucked to Michigan. This arrangement lasted until 2010 when garbage was sent to the new Green Lane landfill site in Elgin County.|$|E
5|$|In December 1933, Sale Urban District {{submitted}} {{a petition to}} the Privy Council {{in an attempt to}} gain a charter of incorporation. At the time, Sale UD had the largest population and highest rateable value of any urban district in the country. The petition was successful and on 21 September 1935 Sale UD was granted borough status, and became the Municipal Borough of Sale. Following the Local Government Act 1972, on 1 April 1974 the Municipal Borough of Sale was abolished. Sale became an unparished area of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, a local government district of the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. The town's education, town planning, <b>waste</b> <b>collection,</b> health, social care and other services are administered by Trafford Council.|$|E

50|$|Another {{controversial}} {{issue in the}} uk is {{the frequency of the}} <b>waste</b> <b>collections.</b> To save money, many councils are cutting the frequency of both general <b>waste</b> and recyclables <b>collections.</b> This has led to problems from larger families, and has led to overflowing and fly tipping. For example, previously, Bury Council collected general waste once a week and recyclables fortnightly. This has now changed to fortnightly for general waste and monthly (every 4 weeks) collection of recyclables.|$|R
5|$|Since 1974 Whitby {{has been}} {{administered}} by Scarborough Borough Council, {{one of the}} seven district councils in North Yorkshire. For borough council purposes the town comprises three wards, Mayfield, Streonshalh and Whitby West Cliff. The borough council is a non-metropolitan district, responsible for housing, planning, leisure and recreation, <b>waste</b> <b>collection,</b> environmental health and revenue collection. North Yorkshire County Council is a non-metropolitan county providing education, transport, highways, fire, waste disposal, social and library services. At the lowest level of governance Whitby has a town council which, for election and administrative purposes, is divided into six electoral wards represented by 19 councillors responsible for burial grounds, allotments, play areas and street lighting. Elections to the town council are held every four years.|$|E

The city has given a few surveys for citizens to rate {{the quality of life}} and city services. The largest department in the city is the public works department with a budget of $36.7million. The police department is second with a budget of $22.4million, while the fire department has a budget of $15million. The parks department has $6.1million, and the Davenport Public Library has a $3.8million budget.|$|E
5|$|Waste is {{delivered}} to the station by road, using up to 100 <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> vehicles. Up to 2,800 tonnes of waste a week or as much as 1,000 tonnes of waste a day, can be delivered at the plant. A rail head was also built on the railway sidings adjacent to the site in 2009. This allows for waste to be {{delivered to the}} plant by rail, rather than just by road. This is more sustainable as it reduces the amount of traffic on local roads. In December 2011, {{it was announced that}} the rail head would be used to receive up 500,000 tonnes of residual waste per year from Merseyside via a rail waste transfer facility at Knowley Industrial Park, Kirby, in a contract worth £400million.|$|E
50|$|Although {{recycling}} is required {{right across the}} UK, recycling rules differ depending on the local council.

5|$|New Brunswick seven rural communities, an {{increase}} from four {{as of the}} 2011 census following the incorporations of Kedgwick in 2012 and Cocagne and Hanwell in 2014. These seven rural communities had a cumulative population of 19,616 in the 2016 Census. New Brunswick's largest and smallest rural communities are Beaubassin East and Saint-André with populations of 6,376 and 772 respectively. Rural communities elect local councils and {{are responsible for the}} delivery of some local services, including administrative services, community planning and emergency measures. The province of New Brunswick ensures the delivery of other services including solid <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> and recreation services unless the rural community chooses to take on these responsibilities. Rural communities that include a former village or town are an exception, as they are responsible to provide all services that were previously provided by their former municipality.|$|E
5|$|Trafford Council is {{responsible}} for the administration of local services, such as education, social services, town planning, <b>waste</b> <b>collection</b> and council housing. The area is divided into seven electoral wards: Altrincham, Bowdon, Broadheath, Hale Barns, Hale Central, Timperley, and Village. These wards have 21 out of the 63 seats on the Trafford Council; as of the 2014 local elections fifteen of these seats were held by the Conservative Party, three by the Labour Party, and three by the Liberal Democrats.•• Altrincham was in the eponymous parliamentary constituency which was created in 1885. This lasted until 1945 when it was replaced by Altrincham and Sale. In 1997, this in turn became part of the newly created constituency of Altrincham and Sale West. Since its formation, Altrincham and Sale West has been represented in the House of Commons by the Conservative MP, Graham Brady. This is one of only two Conservative seats in Greater Manchester.|$|E

40|$|The UK’s {{reliance}} on landfill sites for waste disposal has been addressed {{in recent years}} with the Landfill Directive and Landfill Tax. This has encouraged Local Authorities to seek alternative methods of treating household waste, introducing and expanding kerbside collections of recyclates and organic waste.

Drivers and instruments for change and various approaches to kerbside <b>waste</b> <b>collections</b> are discussed. The current household waste management challenges in the UK are identified, including the division of responsibility for household waste management between various Local Authorities and Government Departments and the methods available to tackle these issues. The research revealed adopting an integrated management system for household waste to comply with legislation and behavioural attitudes towards recycling and waste reduction activities are obstacles facing Local Authorities. Conversely, segregation of household waste by material is increasing, with separate kerbside collections for recyclates, organic waste and bulky <b>waste</b> <b>collections,</b> some of which is selected for reuse. The challenge now {{is to improve the}} yield of recyclates, reach people that do not segregate their waste for recycling and increase the quantity of material from participating householders with imaginative ways for reuse and recycling...|$|R
