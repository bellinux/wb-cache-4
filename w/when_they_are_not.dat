5|$|A small grayed-out grenade icon {{appears in}} the center of the screen when the player is near a grenade, with an arrow {{pointing}} in the direction of the grenade. Enemies can sometimes seem to be dead <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not,</b> where the enemy can still wield his side arm and fire at the player.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the growth}} of the Internet, the {{characteristics}} of local area networks (LANs)--computer networks that do not extend beyond a few kilometers—remain distinct. This is because networks on this scale do not require all the features associated with larger networks and are often more cost-effective and efficient without them. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> connected with the Internet, they also have the advantages of privacy and security. However, purposefully lacking a direct connection to the Internet does not provide assured protection from hackers, military forces, or economic powers. These threats exist if there are any methods for connecting remotely to the LAN.|$|E
5|$|During matches, wrestlers have {{a health}} meter that drains as they perform special moves, and {{gradually}} refills <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> attacking. Different moves use up different amounts of energy, and certain characters can win any match by repeatedly using a particularly damaging move {{that does not}} require much energy. Several different power-ups are also available in the game, including a donut that increases speed, bowling pins {{that can be used}} as clubs, and bubble gum that slows players down.|$|E

5|$|From {{the moment}} the egg is hatched, the male {{macaroni}} penguin cares for the newly hatched chick. For about 23 to 25 days, the male protects its offspring and helps to keep it warm, since {{only a few of}} its feathers have grown in by this time. The female brings food to the chick every one to two days. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> being protected by the adult male penguins, the chicks form crèches to keep warm and stay protected. Once their adult feathers have grown in at about 60 to 70days, they are ready to go out to sea on their own.|$|E
5|$|In medusae {{the only}} {{supporting}} structure is the mesoglea. Hydra and most sea anemones close their mouths <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> feeding, {{and the water}} in the digestive cavity then acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, rather like a water-filled balloon. Other polyps such as Tubularia use columns of water-filled cells for support. Sea pens stiffen the mesoglea with calcium carbonate s and tough fibrous proteins, rather like sponges.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{continues}} to defend individuals who feel abused or improperly {{treated by the}} government. Often the American Civil Liberties Union is the group {{to stand up for}} an individual when being discriminated against because of their religion, sex, gender, sexuality, race, or class, even <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> the popular opinion. The Reproductive Freedom Project, however, goes deeper than the ACLU. The Project promotes sexual and reproductive health by providing lessons about contraception, knowing about one's reproductive rights and assisting with the financial burdens of abortions and all of the logistics that may go into that.|$|E

5|$|Amanda {{encounters}} several antagonists {{over the}} course of the game, including hostile humans and androids. These foes can be defeated with gunplay or other offensive means. There is also a single alien creature that pursues the player. The alien creature cannot be defeated, requiring the player to use stealth tactics in order to survive. Instead of following a predetermined path, the alien has the ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt the player by sight or sound. Along the way, the player can use both a flashlight and a motion tracker to detect the alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of the alien finding the player. For example, if the alien is moving and close enough, the tracker's sound will attract the alien, forcing the player to wisely use the tracker and remove it as soon as it detects motion. The motion tracker cannot detect enemies <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> moving and cannot determine whether the alien creature is up in the ducts or on ground level.|$|E

After more arguments Rhys suggests they spend time apart. Jacqui then goes missing, but is later found safe. She goes to see a counsellor and she and Rhys begin to rebuild their relationship.|$|E

25|$|In superhero fiction, {{eyeglasses}} {{have become}} a standard component of various heroes' disguises (as masks), allowing them to adopt a nondescript demeanor <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> in their superhero persona: Superman {{is well known for}} wearing 1950s style horn-rimmed glasses as Clark Kent, while Wonder Woman wears either round, Harold Lloyd style glasses or 1970s style bug-eye glasses as Diana Prince.

The latter displays a single screen when both characters are near each other, but splits it apart <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not.</b> Playing the game with two players reveals dialogue and jokes between the characters not heard in the single player game.|$|E
