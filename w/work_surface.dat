We demonstrate that such principles can be applied to physical <b>work</b> <b>surfaces</b> to provide various types of hands-free assistance based on the needs of users and their tasks. Context-aware <b>work</b> <b>surfaces</b> use vision recognition in combination with a model of the user and the task to improve the accessibility, safety, comfort and efficiency of interfacing with these <b>work</b> <b>surfaces.</b> These <b>work</b> <b>surfaces</b> can support varied useful scenarios robustly. Their adaptable architecture can be applied to <b>work</b> <b>surfaces</b> as diverse as computer desks, kitchen countertops and hospital sinks. Context-Aware <b>work</b> <b>surfaces</b> operate based on user models that consider ergonomics and sensor placement, the expected task and environment, and recognize when these parameters are exceeded. These <b>work</b> <b>surfaces</b> automatically adjust their height and slope to individual users and provide task-specific assistance such as a hands-free tap for a sink, hand-washing compliance for hospital, and task-aware lighting for a desk.

50|$|Wooden countertops {{can come}} in a variety of designs ranging from butcher block to joined planks to single wide stave. Wood is {{considered}} to be the most eco-friendly option when it comes to choosing a kitchen countertop as wood is a renewable resource. Wood countertops must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected after contact with foods such as raw meat. Although the use of wooden <b>work</b> <b>surfaces</b> is prohibited in commercial food production areas in the EU, and the US Department of Agriculture advises against the use of wooden chopping boards, research by the Food Research Institute at the University of Wisconsin has shown that wooden <b>work</b> <b>surfaces</b> are no more dangerous, and in some cases safer than plastic alternatives. They have shown that while bacteria do get absorbed by the wood, they do not multiply and eventually die. While brand new plastic <b>work</b> <b>surfaces</b> are indeed easy to disinfect, once they have become heavily knife scarred they are nearly impossible to completely disinfect. This is not a problem with wooden <b>work</b> <b>surfaces</b> where the number of knife cuts made little difference.|$|R

25|$|In practice, PCR {{can fail}} for various reasons, {{in part due}} to its {{sensitivity}} to contamination causing amplification of spurious DNA products. Because of this, a number of techniques and procedures have been developed for optimizing PCR conditions. Contamination with extraneous DNA is addressed with lab protocols and procedures that separate pre-PCR mixtures from potential DNA contaminants. This usually involves spatial separation of PCR-setup areas from areas for analysis or purification of PCR products, use of disposable plasticware, and thoroughly cleaning the <b>work</b> <b>surface</b> between reaction setups. Primer-design techniques are important in improving PCR product yield and in avoiding the formation of spurious products, and the usage of alternate buffer components or polymerase enzymes can help with amplification of long or otherwise problematic regions of DNA. Addition of reagents, such as formamide, in buffer systems may increase the specificity and yield of PCR. Computer simulations of theoretical PCR results (Electronic PCR) may be performed to assist in primer design.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{elementary}} design model “Contact & Channel Model ” (C&CM) {{is a new}} {{access to}} the treatment of technical systems. It connects the abstract level of the function of a technical system with the detailed level of the system’s real shape. This connection is generated by the description of the areas relevant to the function of the system: The <b>Working</b> <b>Surface</b> Pairs and the Channel and Support Structures linking them. Basic hypotheses concerning C&CM are described in [Mat 02]. They define the connections between a pair of working surfaces and their linking channel and support structure. Two important hypotheses are that functions can only be generated in <b>Working</b> <b>Surface</b> Pairs and that the fulfilment of any technical function at least needs two <b>Working</b> <b>Surface</b> Pairs and a connecting Channel and Support Structure. In this paper these two basic hypotheses are validated and explained by means of technical examples. Key words: design theory, element model, analysis, synthesis, thinking process 1...|$|R

2500|$|The Type A1 cabinet, {{formerly}} known as Type A, has a minimum inflow velocity of 75ft/min. The downflow air, considered contaminated, splits just above the <b>work</b> <b>surface</b> (the BSCs smoke split) and mixes with the inflow. This air is drawn, through ductwork, {{up the back of}} the cabinet where it is then blown into a positive pressure, contaminated plenum. Here, the air is either recirculated, through a HEPA filter, back down over the work zone, or exhausted out of the cabinet (also through a HEPA filter). Sizing of HEPA filters and an internal damper are used to balance these air volumes. This type is not safe for work with hazardous chemicals even when exhausted with a [...] "thimble" [...] or canopy to avoid disturbing internal air flow.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the safest}} and easiest ways to clean {{textiles}} is to vacuum them. [...] The fabric is placed on a clean, flat <b>work</b> <b>surface.</b> [...] If the specimen is particularly delicate, or simply as a precaution, a fibreglass screen edged with twill tape may be placed over the textile. [...] The screen allows dirt and dust to pass through, but prevents individual threads from being pulled loose or unravelled further by the suction. [...] Using a vacuum attachment and the lowest power setting, move the suction over the screen until the entire area has been cleaned. [...] If needed, move the screen to a new area and begin again. [...] Always remember to vacuum {{both sides of the}} textile, as dirt may filter through to the other side. [...] Hanging textiles will need to be vacuumed less often than horizontal pieces, as there are fewer places where dust can collect.|$|E
2500|$|The Type C1 BSC was {{borne out}} of {{necessity}} to control infectious material, chemical hazards, reduce operating costs and add flexibility in modern laboratories. The Type C1 moves air by mixing inflow air with {{the air in the}} columns of downflow air marked for recirculation. Air above a clearly delineated section of the <b>work</b> <b>surface</b> is drawn by a second internal fan where it is exhausted through a HEPA filter. The C1 differs from a Type A in that it can use this single pass airflow, and when installed in a ducted operating mode, can protect from hazardous chemistry, like the Type Bs. The C1 also differs from the Type B BSCs in several ways; (1) it does not require a hard connected, dedicated exhaust system and blower to operate, (2) pending a risk assessment, the BSC can run for an extended duration to increase operator protection during a remote exhaust system failure, and (3) Type C1 BSCs can run without being connected to an exhaust system at all.|$|E
