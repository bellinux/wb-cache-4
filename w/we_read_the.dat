500|$|The {{script was}} given to Maurice Hurley to rewrite. He took six weeks for the rewrite, and his initial version was {{received}} poorly by TNG executives. Hurley later said, [...] "they absolutely hated it, I think they wanted to fire me, {{and they would have}} if I didn't have a guaranteed contract". He rewrote the script, and this version was filmed. Hurley was pleased with the result, saying that [...] "everything about that episode worked". The final version differed significantly from the original Reaves-Duane script; Duane later said that only two scenes remained: where Picard sees his mother, and where he nearly falls out of the turbolift into space. Reaves later said that the episode [...] "came together much better on the screen than we thought it would when <b>we</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> script. We were lucky, because it was out of our hands".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{disagreed}} {{about how}} successful {{the film was}} in capturing the novel's ambiguity, {{which is part of}} the enduring appeal of James's story. For Tim Dowling, a columnist for The Guardian, the film failed in this regard. The novella, Dowling explained, can be understood as a straightforward ghost story, but it can also be understood as a story about Ann's madness, and there is further ambiguity concerning whether the children are being controlled by Quint and Jessel, or whether the children are controlling Ann. He suggested that [...] "there's probably a subtlety to all this ambiguity on the page which, when translated to the screen, just looks like having it both ways." [...] As a result, [...] "the narrative was at times more evasive than ambiguous". Whittaker felt that the film failed to appropriately present the novella's ambiguity and implicit themes, saying that the adaptation [...] "feels oddly obligated to fill in all those blanks, and it's really the script's fault". Sutcliffe expressed a similar view; for example, he noted that [...] "when the governess sees Quint on the tower for the first time so do we, and the thing that really haunts us as <b>we</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> story—uncertainty—vanishes to be replaced by a much duller kind of fretfulness, about when something is next going to pop out at us." [...] By contrast, Chater and Teeman (both writing for The Times) felt the ambiguity of the film was praiseworthy, with Chater asking whether the ghosts truly exist or are just a manifestation of [...] "hysterical imagination", and Teeman suggesting that viewers will be more likely to believe (with Dr Fisher) that Ann's retelling is accurate. The Scotsmans Whitelaw praised Welch's ability to balance the various subtexts of the film while still delivering an effective narrative.|$|E

2500|$|Oates founded The Ontario Review, a {{literary}} magazine, in 1974, with Raymond J. Smith, {{her husband and}} fellow graduate student, who would eventually become a professor of 18th-century literature. Smith would serve as editor of this venture, and Oates served as associate editor. The magazine's mission, according to Smith, the editor, was to bridge the literary and artistic culture of the U.S. and Canada: [...] "We tried to do this by publishing writers and artists from both countries, as well as essays and reviews of an intercultural nature." [...] In 1980, Oates and Smith founded Ontario Review Books, an independent publishing house. In 2004, Oates described the partnership as [...] "a marriage of like minds—both my husband and I are so interested in literature and <b>we</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> same books; he'll be reading a book and then I'll read it—we trade {{and we talk about}} our reading at meal times…".|$|E

2500|$|Morton's {{claim to}} have invented jazz in 1902 aroused resentment. The jazz historian, musician, and {{composer}} Gunther Schuller says of Morton's [...] "hyperbolic assertions" [...] that there is [...] "no proof to the contrary" [...] and that Morton's [...] "considerable accomplishments in themselves provide reasonable substantiation". Alan Lomax, who recorded extensive biographical interviews of Morton at the Library of Congress in 1938, did not agree that Morton was an egoist: In being called a supreme egotist, Jelly Roll was often a victim of loose and lurid reporting. If <b>we</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> words that he himself wrote, we learn that he almost had an inferiority complex {{and said that he}} created is own style of jazz piano because [...] "All my fellow musicians were much faster in manipulations, I thought than I, and I did not feel as though I was in their class." [...] So he used a slower tempo to permit flexibility through the use of more notes, a pinch of Spanish to give a number of right seasoning, the avoidance of playing triple forte continuously, and many other points". --Quoted in John Szwed, Dr Jazz.|$|E
2500|$|A {{review of}} the book in Publishers Weekly was favorable, and commented, [...] "All of the essays ... exhibit a {{timeless}} prose {{in the midst of}} meeting deadlines. But many also resonate with a special sense of timeliness". Contributing editor of The Quarterly Conversation Elizabeth Wadell reviewed the book, and commented, [...] "these articles almost unanimously engage". Wadell lamented that the profile of Karl Lagerfeld by Vanessa Grigoriadis seemed lighter fare compared {{to the rest of the}} articles in the book, [...] "Though it is cleverly written, it really does seem to be, well, all style." [...] Wadell recommented the book for readers, and observed, [...] "You can skip a lot of articles in a magazine and still feel that you 'got through' the whole thing; a book isn't over till it's over. So how then, should <b>we</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> Best American Magazine Articles? Out of order, I'd say, skipping at least one article, but keeping it to read again." [...] Colin Murphy reviewed the book for The Irish Times, and wrote favorably of the piece by Christopher Hitchens on Agent Orange. Murphy also wrote positively of the book as a whole, and his review concluded, [...] "the best in this volume stands with the best anywhere, essays with the compulsive readability of a good novel, but the immediacy and moral power of good journalism." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{work was}} set aside until 1815 when Coleridge {{compiled}} manuscripts of his poems for a collection titled Sibylline Leaves. The poem remained buried in obscurity until a 10 April 1816 meeting between Coleridge and Lord Byron, who persuaded Coleridge to publish Christabel and [...] "Kubla Khan" [...] as fragments. Leigh Hunt, the poet and essayist, witnessed {{the event and}} wrote, [...] "He recited his 'Kubla Khan' one morning to Lord Byron, in his Lordship's house in Piccadilly, when I {{happened to be in}} another room. I remember the other's coming away from him, highly struck with his poem, and saying how wonderfully he talked. This was the impression of everyone who heard him." [...] Byron arranged for John Murray to publish the poem with Christabel and [...] "The Pains of Sleep" [...] along with prefaces to the works. A contract was drawn up on 12 April 1816 for 80 pounds. Charles Lamb, poet and friend of Coleridge, witnessed Coleridge's work towards publishing the poem and wrote to Wordsworth: [...] "Coleridge is printing Xtabel by Lord Byron's recommendation to Murray, with what he calls a vision of Kubla Khan – which said vision he repeats so enchantingly that it irradiates & brings Heaven & Elysian bowers into my parlour while he sings or says it". Coleridge stayed in London to work on the poem and also to try and break his opium addiction. However, not everyone was happy with the idea of the poem's being published, as Coleridge's wife, who was not with him, wrote to Thomas Poole, [...] "Oh! when will he ever give his friends anything but pain? he has been so unwise as to publish his fragments of 'Christabel' & 'Kubla-Khan' ... we were all sadly vexed when <b>we</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> advertisement of these things." ...|$|E

2500|$|Sonnet 64 is a {{great example}} of why people always say [...] "You should never let your past {{interfere}} with your present". Barret argues that sonnet 64 [...] "provides an example of past-oriented natural habitats that might interfere with the productive considerations of the future". In other words, because the speaker is letting the past overwhelm his thoughts, he therefore cannot think positively about the future due to past habits or tendencies. Unlike some of the other sonnets addressed to the young man, sonnet 64 moves toward a feeling of the lover's exposure to the risk of being destroyed. Barret also argues that the phonetic play between ruminate and ruinate is as she says an [...] "underscore a relationship inherent in the poem’s logic", [...] "Each quatrain of the sonnet open with the same construction — [...] "When I have seen" [...] — yet these statements are never met with a summational [...] "then", so the temporal ambiguity the phrase creates the remains unresolved: Does the speaker gesture toward repeated past actions ('in the instances that I have seen') or forward to a causational limit point ('once I have seen')?". When <b>we</b> <b>read</b> <b>the</b> lines that pertain to the waves and the shore, [...] "at times the waves are winning against the shore, and then at times the shore is winning against the waves", the speaker almost speaks in a tone of confidence and determination to not let time control his life. Although when he goes to say Time will take my love away we begin {{to get a sense of}} uncertainty within the speaker. This uncertainty within the speaker is described by Barret when she argues [...] "The sonnet registers temporal matters in personal terms; the couplet never corrects the poem's grammatically obscured engagement with time, but instead introduces a paralyzing temporal collapse: the present moment becomes overwhelmed by an anticipation of future loss—an extreme version of 'I miss you already.'.... The ruin/ruminate pairing bespeaks a suspicion of an imagined time spent looking back".|$|E
