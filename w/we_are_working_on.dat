Rohde responded [...] "You have to understand, it's a giant complicated machine sitting on top of, like, a 46-foot tall tower {{in the middle of a}} finished building. So, it's really hard to fix, but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> it. And we continue to work on it. We have tried several 'things', none of them quite get to the key, turning of the 40-foot tower inside of a finished building, but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> it... I will fix the Yeti someday, I swear." ...|$|E
500|$|By April 2000, Columbia dropped Doctor Strange, {{which then}} had Michael France {{attached}} {{to write a}} script and interest from Chuck Russell and Stephen Norrington to direct. By June 2001, Dimension Films acquired the film rights, with Goyer back on board as writer and director. Goyer hinted scheduling conflicts might ensue with a film adaptation of Murder Mysteries, and promised not to be highly dependent on computer-generated imagery. However, by August 2001, Miramax acquired the film rights from Dimension, and by March 2002, Goyer {{had dropped out of}} the project. A 2005 release date was announced the next March, while in June 2004, a script still had yet to be written. Marvel Studios CEO Avi Arad stated, [...] "We are nowhere with that. That's a tough one to write, but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> it. We are trying to find the real Jerry Garcia of the writing community." [...] In April 2005, Paramount Pictures acquired Doctor Strange from Miramax, as part of Marvel Studios' attempt to independently produce their own films. At the time, the film was projected to have a budget of no more than $165 million.|$|E
500|$|During an {{interview}} with the Chilean newspaper La Tercera in October 2010, de la Rocha allegedly confirmed that a new album was in the works, with a possibility of a 2011 release. De la Rocha is reported as saying, [...] "We are all bigger and more mature and we do not fall into the problems we faced 10 or 15 years ago. This is different and we project a lot: <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> a new album due out next year, perhaps summer for the northern hemisphere". However, in early May 2011, guitarist Tom Morello said that the band were not working on a new album, but would not rule out the possibility of future studio work. [...] "The band is not writing songs, the band is not in the studio", Morello told The Pulse of Radio. [...] "We get along famously and we all, you know, intend to do more Rage Against the Machine stuff in the future, but beyond sort of working out a concert this year, there's nothing else on the schedule (for 2011)". The band created its own festival, the L.A. Rising. As Morello stated, the only Rage Against the Machine appearance for 2011 was a performance on July 30 at the L.A. Rising festival with El Gran Silencio, Immortal Technique, Lauryn Hill, Rise Against and Muse. As of mid-2012, there are no plans for any more shows. During {{an interview}} on July 30, 2011, Commerford seemingly contradicted Morello's comments, stating that new material was being written, and specific plans {{for the next two years}} were in place.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2008 {{interview}} Khan {{said that}} she, unlike other artists, felt very {{optimistic about the}} current changes in the recording industry, including music downloading. [...] "I'm glad things are shifting and artists – not labels – are having {{more control over their}} art. My previous big record company (Warner Bros.) has vaults of my recordings that haven't seen the light of day that people need to hear. This includes Robert Palmer's original recording of 'Addicted to Love' – which they took my vocals off of! <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>working</b> <b>on</b> getting it (and other tracks) all back now." [...] In 2009, Khan hit the road with singers Anastacia and Lulu for Here Come the Girls.|$|E
