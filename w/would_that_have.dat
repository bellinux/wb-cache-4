6000|$|... "What good <b>would</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been to me?" [...] she answered. [...] "I have no name, no friends. Can't {{you imagine}} the sort {{of people who would}} have come hanging on to my skirts, if I had made my début on the scene as a widow or a {{spinster}} with a large fortune, unattached, looking for companions? No! I need your name, Mr. Stirling Deane." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What <b>would</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been to him,--with his wealth?" [...] said Lady Laura. [...] "He has a {{position}} {{of his own and}} need not care for such things. There are men who should not attempt what is called independence in Parliament. By doing so they simply decline to make themselves useful. But there are a few whose special walk in life it is to be independent, and, as it were, unmoved by parties." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{might have}} done more of the best, had he very greatly cared. Alone among poets, he had neither vanity nor jealousy; he thought little of his own verse and his own fame: <b>would</b> <b>that</b> he <b>had</b> thought more! <b>would</b> <b>that</b> he <b>had</b> been more careful of what was so precious! But he turned to prose; bade poetry farewell.|$|R
60|$|Objection 3.

'How can I tell?' said Berenger, {{showing his}} {{face for a}} moment, covered with tears; 'only that my only friend is dead, and some villainous trick has seized me, just--just as I might have found her.

60|$|How {{critical}} {{was that}} Minute wherein the General met his retreating Commander? {{a very few}} Steps farther had excluded us our own Conquests, to the utter Loss of all those greater Glories which ensu'd. Nor <b>would</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been the worst; for besides the Shame attending such an ill concerted Retreat from our Acquests on Monjouick, we must have felt the accumulative Disgrace of infamously retiring aboard the Ships that brought us; but Heaven reserv'd for our General amazing Scenes both of Glory and Mortification.|$|E

That I could have brought all my hard-earned treasures to {{the feet of}} the Poet of the Sun, and cried, [...] "Take me!--Hero, warrior, statesman, sage, priest of the God of Light! Take thy slave! Command her--send her--to martyrdom, if thou wilt!"

6000|$|... "I think," [...] Hilda resumed, [...] "I {{shall never}} go to the confessional again; for there can {{scarcely}} come such a sore trial twice in my life. If I had been a wiser girl, a stronger, and a more sensible, very likely I might not {{have gone to the}} confessional at all. It was the sin of others that drove me thither; not my own, though it almost seemed so. Being what I am, I must either have done what you saw me doing, or have gone mad. <b>Would</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been better?" ...|$|E

Have you not tried to flee, {{and did not}} the Open Eye confront you in the canyon? Who can escape the watch of that unsleeping eye of Utah? Not I, at least. Horrible tasks have, indeed, been laid upon me; and the most ungrateful was the last; but had I refused my offices, <b>would</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> spared your husband?

60|$|But Madeline was by {{no means}} satisfied. She could not {{understand}} economy in {{a matter of life and}} death. If Sir Jacob's coming would have cost fifty pounds, or a hundred, what <b>would</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> signified, weighed in such a balance? Such a sum would be nothing to her father. Had Augustus fallen and broken his arm all the Sir Jacobs in London would not have been considered too costly could their joint coming have mitigated any danger. She did not however dare to speak to her mother again, so she said a word or two to Peregrine Orme, who was constant in his attendance on Felix. Peregrine had been very kind, and she had seen it, and her heart therefore warmed towards him.|$|E

6000|$|... "Being {{so young}} {{you still have}} the impatience of youth, Macumazahn, {{although}} your hair grows white. Wait a while and you will understand all. Well, you lay that night on the topmost rock of Isandhlwana, and there you saw and heard strange things. You heard the rest of the white soldiers come and lie down to rest among their dead brothers, and depart again unharmed. Oh! what fools are these Zulu generals nowadays. They send out an impi to attack men behind walls, spears against rifles, and are defeated. Had they kept that impi to fall {{on the rest of the}} English when they walked into the trap, not a man of your people would have been left alive. <b>Would</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> happened in the time of Chaka?" ...|$|E
6000|$|And, {{saddening}} on the sudden, spake Isolt, [...] "I {{had forgotten}} {{all in my}} strong joy To see thee--yearnings?--ay! for, hour by hour, Here in the never-ended afternoon, O sweeter than all memories of thee, Deeper than any yearnings after thee Seem'd those far-rolling, westward-smiling seas, Watched from this tower.

60|$|On warm mornings {{we would}} choose some secluded {{spot on the}} beach, or on the fragrant, green-turfed cliffs, or in the Uplyme meadows. Though I could never persuade Mrs Bowater to join me, I {{sometimes}} dabbled in the sun in some ice-cold, shallow, seaweedy pool between the rocks. Then, while she read the newspaper, or crocheted, I also, over book or needle, indulged in endless reverie. For hours together, with {{eyes fixed on the}} glass-green, tumbling water, I would listen to its enormous, far, phantom bells and voices, happier than words can tell. And I would lie at full length, basking in the heat, for it was a hot May, almost wishing that the huge furnace of the sun would melt me away into a little bit of glass: and what colour <b>would</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been, I wonder? If a small heart can {{fall in love with the}} whole world, that heart was mine. But the very intensity of this greed and delight--and the tiniest shell or pebble on the beach seemed to be all but exploding with it--was a severe test of my strength.|$|E
60|$|Ralph Newton did nothing, gentle reader, {{which would}} have caused thee greatly to grieve for him, nothing {{certainly}} {{which would have}} caused thee to repudiate him, had he been thy brother. And gentlest, sweetest reader, had he come to thee as thy lover, with sufficient protest of love, and with all his history written in his hand, <b>would</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> caused thee to reject his suit? Had he been thy neighbour, thou well-to-do reader, with {{a house in the}} country, would he not have been welcome to thy table? Wouldst thou have avoided him at his club, thou reader from the West-end? Has he not settled himself respectably, thou grey-haired, novel-reading paterfamilias, thou materfamilias, with daughters of thine own to be married? In life would he have been held to have disgraced himself,--except in the very moment in which he seemed to be in danger? Nevertheless, the faults of a Ralph Newton, and not the vices of a Varney or a Barry Lyndon are the evils against which men should in these days be taught to guard themselves;--which women also should be made to hate. Such is the writer's apology for his very indifferent hero, Ralph the Heir.|$|E
60|$|As {{the next}} {{scene in the}} play, the State of South Carolina bombarded Fort Sumter. Was {{that to be the}} moment for a peaceable separation? Let us suppose that O'Connell had marched down to the Pigeon House, at Dublin, and had taken it, in 1843, let us say, <b>would</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been an {{argument}} to us for allowing Ireland to set up for herself? Is that the way of men's minds, or of the minds of nations? The powers of the President were defined by law, as agreed upon among all the States of the Union, and against that power and against that law South Carolina raised her hand, and the other States joined her in rebellion. When circumstances had come to that, it was no longer possible that the North should shun the war. To my thinking the rights of rebellion are holy. Where would the world have been, or where would the world hope to be, without rebellion? But let rebellion look the truth in the face, and not blanch from its own consequences. She has to judge her own opportunities and to decide on her own fitness. Success is the test of her judgment. But rebellion can never be successful except by overcoming the power against which she raises herself. She has no right to expect bloodless triumphs; and if she be not the stronger in the encounter which she creates, she must bear the penalty of her rashness. Rebellion is justified by being better served than constituted authority, but cannot be justified otherwise. Now and again it may happen that rebellion's cause is so good that constituted authority will fall to the ground at the first glance of her sword. This was so the other day in Naples, when Garibaldi blew away the king's armies with a breath. But this is not so often. Rebellion knows that it must fight, and the legalized power against which rebels rise must of necessity fight also.|$|E
