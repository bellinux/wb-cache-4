5|$|Enamel is {{the hardest}} and most highly mineralized {{substance}} of the body. It {{is one of the}} four major tissues which make up the tooth, along with dentin, cementum, and dental pulp. It is normally visible and must be supported by underlying dentin. 96% of enamel consists of mineral, with water and organic material comprising the rest. The normal color of enamel varies from light yellow to grayish white. At the edges of teeth where there is no dentin underlying the enamel, the color sometimes has a slightly blue tone. Since enamel is semitranslucent, the color of dentin and any restorative dental material underneath the enamel strongly affects the appearance of a tooth. Enamel varies in thickness over the surface of the tooth and is often thickest at the cusp, up to 2.5mm, and thinnest at its border, which is seen clinically as the CEJ. The <b>wear</b> <b>rate</b> of enamel, called attrition, is 8 micrometers a year from normal factors.|$|E
25|$|The point angle, or {{the angle}} formed {{at the tip}} of the bit, is {{determined}} by the material the bit will be operating in. Harder materials require a larger point angle, and softer materials require a sharper angle. The correct point angle for the hardness of the material influences wandering, chatter, hole shape, and <b>wear</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to bacterial invasion, enamel is also susceptible to other destructive forces. [...] Bruxism, {{also known as}} clenching of or grinding on teeth, destroys enamel very quickly. The <b>wear</b> <b>rate</b> of enamel, called attrition, is 8micrometers a year from normal factors. A common misconception is that enamel wears away mostly from chewing, but actually teeth rarely touch during chewing. Furthermore, normal tooth contact is compensated physiologically by the periodontal ligaments (pdl) and the arrangement of dental occlusion. The truly destructive forces are the parafunctional movements, as found in bruxism, which can cause irreversible damage to the enamel.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, {{the wear}} of {{materials}} {{has been characterized}} by weight loss and <b>wear</b> <b>rate.</b> However, {{studies have found that}} wear coefficient is more suitable.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to use wear {{simulation}} to develop <b>wear</b> <b>rates</b> for two modern composite systems and then compare these rates with clinical studies on the same materials. METHOD AND MATERIALS: A spring-loaded piston wear simulator was used to generate localized <b>wear</b> <b>rates</b> for P 50 and Z 100 at 100, 000, 200, 000, 300, 000, and 400, 000 cycles. Clinical studies on P 50 and Z 100 conducted at Creighton University and the Catholic University of Leuven were used for comparison of clinical wear to the laboratory values. Regression analysis was employed to define the <b>wear</b> <b>rates.</b> RESULTS: The laboratory <b>wear</b> <b>rates</b> determined with simulation for P 50 and Z 100 were similar. Clinical occlusal contact area (OCA) wear for P 50 and Z 100 had small differences and were pooled to provide comparison with laboratory data. <b>Wear</b> <b>rates</b> determined from linear regression analysis provided equivalency factors between laboratory localized wear and clinical OCA wear that could be used for future studies. Further regression analysis comparing OCA and generalized clinical wear allowed a conversion factor of 4. 5 to be determined. CONCLUSION: Localized wear from laboratory simulation may be a useful predictor of localized clinical wear and also clinical generalized wear using a conversion factor. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|The rate of erosive wear is {{dependent}} upon a number of factors. The material characteristics of the particles, such as their shape, hardness, impact velocity and impingement angle are primary factors along with {{the properties of the}} surface being eroded. The impingement angle {{is one of the most}} important factors and is widely recognized in literature. For ductile materials the maximum <b>wear</b> <b>rate</b> is found when the impingement angle is approximately 30°, whilst for non ductile materials the maximum <b>wear</b> <b>rate</b> occurs when the impingement angle is normal to the surface.|$|E

40|$|Differences in {{body size}} and diet type (browsergrazer continuum) have formed {{functional}} traits of ruminants, including tooth design. Grazers and mixed-feeders eat a more fibrous diet than browsers, which arguably increase tooth wear. Tooth wear {{has also been}} suggested to increase with body size. Moreover, for species with large distribution ranges, different populations may be exposed to very different ecological factors affecting diet and thus tooth <b>wear</b> <b>rates.</b> Therefore, evolutionary history and contemporary ecological conditions, both operating through diet, may be important for patterns of tooth wear. Here, we compare inter- and intraspecific <b>rates</b> of tooth <b>wear</b> in multiple populations of one large browser (moose Alces alces) and one mixed-feeder (red deer Cervus elaphus) covering the main distribution range of each species in Norway. We found that the mixed-feeding red deer wore teeth faster than the larger and browsing moose, suggesting that feeding-type {{was more important than}} body size for patterns of wear. There was substantial spatial variation in tooth <b>wear</b> <b>rates,</b> but the inter-specific difference in wear was consistent. Molar <b>wear</b> <b>rates,</b> but not incisors <b>wear</b> <b>rates,</b> in the browser were less variable between populations than in the mixed-feeder. There was no close link between incisor and molar <b>wear</b> <b>rates</b> at the population level.

40|$|Abstract. Abrasion <b>wear</b> <b>rates</b> of {{conventional}} and two-step austempered {{ductile cast iron}} (ADI) were investigated. Conventional austempering and two-step austempering processes were carried out at 280, 300, and 320 °C. Microstructures revealed that higher austemperig temperature resulted in coarser ausferrite and higher volume fractions of blocky retained austenite. The ausferrite in two-step austempered ADI was slightly coarser comparing to the coventional ADI since the temperature was raised by 30 °C during austempering. Two-body abrasion <b>wear</b> <b>rates</b> of ADIs were studied using a Suga abrasion wear tester. It was found <b>wear</b> <b>rates</b> of the two-step ADI become significantly lower than those of the conventional ADI, especially when the austempering was carried out at low temperature, i. e. 280 °C.

50|$|Grinding wheel wear is an {{important}} measured factor of grinding in the manufacturing process of engineered parts and tools. Grinding involves the removal process of material and modifying {{the surface of a}} workpiece to some desired finish which might otherwise be unachievable through conventional machining processes. The grinding process itself has been compared to machining operations which employ multipoint cutting tools. The abrasive grains which make up the entire geometry of wheel act as independent small cutting tools. The quality, characteristics, and rate of grinding wheel wear can be affected by contributions of the characteristics of the material of the workpiece, the temperature increase of the workpiece, and the rate of wear of the grinding wheel itself. Moderate <b>wear</b> <b>rate</b> allows for more consistent material size. Maintaining stable grinding forces is preferred rather than high wheel <b>wear</b> <b>rate</b> which can decrease the effectiveness of material removal from the workpiece.|$|E

Self-lubricating chains that require no additional lubrication are available {{from a variety of}} chain manufacturers as well.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are also}} {{stand-alone}} small hole drilling EDM machines with an x-y axis {{also known as}} a super drill or hole popper that can machine blind or through holes.

The electrode tubes operate like the wire in wire-cut EDM machines, having a spark gap and <b>wear</b> <b>rate.</b> Some small-hole drilling EDMs are able to drill through 100 mm of soft or through hardened steel in less than 10 seconds, averaging 50% to 80% <b>wear</b> <b>rate.</b> Holes of 0.3 mm to 6.1 mm can be achieved in this drilling operation. Brass electrodes are easier to machine but are not recommended for wire-cut operations due to eroded brass particles causing [...] "brass on brass" [...] wire breakage, therefore copper is recommended.|$|E

For the modelling of wear of homogeneous bulk materials the models of plastic deformation and brittle fracture are developed.
