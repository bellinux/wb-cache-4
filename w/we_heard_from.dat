500|$|Harrington handed former SDS {{activist and}} New York City {{journalist}} Jack Newfield {{a speech by}} AFL–CIO President George Meany. Addressing the September 1972 Convention of the United Steelworkers of America, Meany ridiculed the Democratic Party Convention, which had been held in Miami: <b>We</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> the gay-lib [...] {{people who want to}} legalize marriage between boys and boys, and between girls and girls... <b>We</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> the people who looked like Jacks, acted like Jills, and had the odor of Johns [...] about them. This gay-baiting taunt was attributed to Kahn by Harrington, and repeated by Newfield in his autobiography. [...] Maurice Isserman's biography of Harrington also described this speech as Kahn's selfhatred, as [...] "Kahn's resort to gaybashing".|$|E
500|$|For his part, anchor Mike Wallace came {{to regret}} his {{participation}} in the episode. [...] "I should have known better," [...] he said in 1992. Speaking in 1996, Wallace stated, [...] "That is [...] God help us [...] what our understanding was of the homosexual lifestyle a mere twenty-five years ago because nobody {{was out of the}} closet and because that's what <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> doctors [...] that's what Socarides told us, {{it was a matter of}} shame." [...] However, Wallace was at the time of broadcast close friends with noted designer James Amster (creator of the landmark Amster Yard courtyard in New York City) and Amster's male long-term companion, men whom Wallace later described as [...] "a wonderful old married couple" [...] and [...] "oth people that [...] admired". Despite this personal knowledge, Wallace relied on the American Psychiatric Association's categorization of homosexuality as a mental illness rather than his own experience in creating the episode. As recently as 1995, Wallace told an interviewer that he believed homosexuals could change their orientation if they really wanted to.|$|E
60|$|But at {{this moment}} <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> the town behind us the long {{sustained}} note of a steam whistle blowing the hour of noon.|$|E
60|$|In a {{few words}} I told her the tale that <b>we</b> had <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> the dying soldier, and she listened eagerly.|$|R
6000|$|And this is {{the story}} as <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> it <b>from</b> one source and another until there could be no {{question}} but that we had all the facts with no embellishments: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you," [...] {{answered}} Tom. [...] "Tad Sobber {{used to go}} to school with us, but he ran away a short while ago and <b>we</b> haven't <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> him since." ...|$|R
60|$|Instantly <b>we</b> <b>heard,</b> <b>from</b> I {{know not}} what recess, a rolling fire of applause and admiration, which swept past us with stately and solemn music, like a hymn of praise.|$|E
6000|$|... "What induced {{you to do}} that, Ruth?" [...] Mary asked, in surprise. [...] "I {{thought you}} had quite settled to say nothing about it until <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Captain Mervyn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I am glad <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Luke,” said Dave. “That {{gives us}} a little to work on. I hope the Emma Brown, or {{whatever}} her name may be, hasn’t sailed yet.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, shucks! We're talkin' same ez we graze," [...] said Nip, [...] "raound an' raound {{in circles}} Rod, <b>we</b> hain't <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> you yet, an' you've more {{know-how}} than any span here." ...|$|R
60|$|After this, <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> little <b>from</b> my brother. His {{letters were}} few and short, and {{generally}} ended with petitions for money. The only important news {{of him that}} reached us, reached us through public channels.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's strange <b>we</b> haven't <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Lawrence yet," [...] {{he said in}} a {{disturbed}} voice. [...] "He hasn't {{given the}} Canadian post office his new address, because here's a letter they have sent on." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's {{been very}} ill, Rob; {{and the doctor}} said to-day that unless <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> you soon {{he would not be}} able to save her life. The {{uncertainty}} about you is killing her." ...|$|E
60|$|The next day, <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> our {{informer}} at Kensington {{that the}} Queen was somewhat better, {{and had been}} up for an hour, though she was not well enough yet to receive any visitor.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{who come}} here to look on have done what we could towards making a success of this here 'blow-out,' and now, {{according}} to my way of thinking, it's time <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Mr. Daniel Roberts." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Belding, I've come west {{to look up}} my lost son," [...] said Mr. Gale. [...] "His sister's {{letters were}} unanswered. <b>We</b> haven't <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> him in months. Is he still here with you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... (6) When <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> all the counties, {{we shall}} {{be able to tell}} with similar {{accuracy}} the political complexion of the State. This information will be forwarded to you as soon as received.|$|R
6000|$|... "Continue, Prince and brother. <b>We</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> {{you that}} which we already know too well--that I am childless. Tell us what we do not know, the desire of your heart which lies hid beneath all these words." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{congratulate you}} on having got through, Captain D'Estrelles," [...] the general said, as he entered. [...] "It is ten days since <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Zamora. We have sent off six messengers, I don't know {{whether any of}} them have arrived." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wast sure, Charity, {{that the}} howl <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> the forest was the yell of the beaten hound?" [...] demanded a handmaiden of Ruth, of a blue-eyed companion, who seemed equally well {{disposed}} to contribute {{her share of}} {{evidence in support of}} any exciting legend.|$|E
6000|$|... 'On that point, fortunately, we {{have not}} got to consult him, Ned--Dorothy has {{definitely}} broken off the engagement. As soon as <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Gilliat of the robbery, she declared that it was positively impossible that the matter should go on, and I quite agreed with her decision.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] Major Swan admitted. [...] "It {{is merely}} a {{corroboration}} of what <b>we</b> have already <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Mullins and Sir Terence." ...|$|R
6000|$|BUILDER. [In a voice {{different}} <b>from</b> any <b>we</b> have <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> him] Say! What {{business had}} he to touch me, a magistrate? I gave my daughter two taps {{with a cane}} in a private house, for interfering with me for taking my wife home-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} wife, [...] "suppose {{you were to}} advance some money on the things yourself, and then if she liked to redeem 'em when she got home, she could. But if <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> nothing <b>from</b> her after two months, we might do as we liked with 'em." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{must confess}} that I agreed with her, though I would have {{preferred}} to postpone it till <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> your family." [...] He was thoughtfully silent a moment; then he said, [...] "But if their decision is to have no weight with us, I think he ought to be told at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you go at once {{into the}} salon, Francisco. You will find my daughters expecting you there, {{for the news}} came an hour ago that the Bonito was {{entering}} port. Of course, <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> the letters from Candia of your adventures with the pirates, and the gallant {{way in which the}} Bonito defeated them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Fortunately, {{the cavalry}} were all down looting their own lines, or {{we must have}} been {{overtaken}} at once. May happily had fainted as I lifted her on to my horse--happily, because the fearful screams that <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> the various bungalows almost drove me mad, and would probably have killed her, for the poor ladies were all her intimate friends.|$|E
60|$|Just as {{the dusk}} shut down and, {{with a very}} heavy heart, I was {{beginning}} to saddle up my horse, <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> wild shouts <b>from</b> the river.|$|R
5000|$|According to Clinton, {{he tried}} to find the guitarist without success. [...] "I tried to find the guy {{and put him on}} another song, but he was gone. He never resurfaced. <b>We</b> never <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> him. He's not {{credited}} on the record because we have no idea who he was." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{certainly}} doesn't {{get into}} as much mischief since {{he began to}} go to school," [...] acknowledged Marilla. [...] "I suppose he works off the tendency with the other boys. But it's a wonder to me <b>we</b> haven't <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Richard Keith before this. Never a word since last May." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{drive me}} to a further disclosure," [...] he declared, after a moment's hesitation, [...] "one, perhaps, which I ought already to have made. I have {{arranged}} for a duplicate of that packet to be prepared and forwarded. I set this matter on foot the moment <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> Miss Abbeway here of her mishap. The duplicate may reach us at any moment." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{not until}} the night had fallen, and the fires of our savage allies glowed red in the shadows, that our two men of science could be dragged away from the fascinations of that primeval lake. Even in the {{darkness}} as we lay upon the strand, <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> time to time the snort and plunge of the huge creatures who lived therein.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! Baas," [...] he answered, [...] "the Basutos {{have got}} them. <b>We</b> <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> an old black woman that Sekukuni had an impi out, so we {{waited on the}} top of that hill about an hour's ride away {{to see if it was}} true. Then {{suddenly}} the doctor Baas appeared riding, and I ran out and asked him if it were safe to go on. He knew me again and answered-- ...|$|E
5000|$|The song isn't {{actually}} {{about the}} Great Salt Lake, but about Lake Murray, a reservoir in Ben Bridwell's {{home state of}} South Carolina. He explained, [...] "A lot of the imagery is about South Carolina, combined with some incidents <b>we</b> <b>heard</b> about <b>from</b> some hilarious fuck-ups we knew from Salt Lake City." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} stranger. [...] "That's what they did. You see, {{the folks in}} Victoria had moved on Eshelby, and the new man was doing what he could for us within reason. Anyway, <b>we</b> hadn't <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> you, and the boys weren't going to make trouble for nothing when Slavin was there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure I don't know, {{excepting}} to {{hold him}} for a ransom. But if they intended to do that it is likely <b>we</b> should have <b>heard</b> <b>from</b> them before this." ...|$|R
