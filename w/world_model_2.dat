40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} constructing a map of an unknown environment by an autonomous agent such as a mobile robot. Because accurate positional information is often difficulty to assure, we {{consider the}} problem of exploration {{in the absence of}} met-ric (positional) information. Worlds are represented by graphs (not necessarily planar) consisting of a fixed number of discrete places linked by bidirectional paths. We assume the robot can consistently enumerate the edges leaving a vertex (that is, it can assign a cyclic ordering). A mobile robot is assigned the task of creating a topological map, i. e. a graph-like representation of the places in the world and their connectivity, by moving from place to place along the paths it encounters. It can detect edges and count them, but cannot directly sense the labels associated with a place or an edge. In principle, this types of representation could be used for non-spatial environments such as computer networks. We present an approach to the exploration of unknown environments for which local sensing information alone is insufficient to distinguish distinct places, based simply on the structure of the world itself. Places are identified by a non-unique signature and by using a collection of such non-unique local signatures, an extended signature may be constructed which determines the robot’s position (although in certain ‘degenerate ’ worlds additional information is required). We describe the “exploration tree ” as a representation of a collection of alternative descriptions of the environment. In addition, heuristics are presented that can accelerate the search for the correct <b>world</b> <b>model.</b> <b>2...</b>|$|E

40|$|We study thick brane <b>world</b> <b>models</b> as Z <b>2</b> -symmetric domain walls {{supported}} by a scalar field with an arbitrary potential V (φ) in 5 D general relativity. Under the global regularity requirement, such configurations (i) have always an AdS asymptotic far from the brane, (ii) are only possible if V (φ) has an alternating sign and (iii) V (φ) should satisfy a certain fine-tuning type equality. Thus a thick brane with any admissible V (φ) is a regularized version of the RS 2 brane immersed in the AdS 5 bulk. The thin brane limit is realized in a universal manner by including an arbitrary thick brane model in a one-parameter family, where the parameter a is associated with brane thickness; the asymptotic value of V (φ) (related to Λ 5, the effective cosmological constant) remains a-independent. The problem of ordinary matter confinement on the brane is discussed for a test scalar field. Its stress-energy tensor is found to diverge at the AdS horizon for both thin and thick branes, making a serious problem for this class of brane <b>world</b> <b>models.</b> 1...|$|R

Learning and adaption are the core paradigms of the intelligent control concepts which enable to increase skilled manipulation and to achieve higher levels of autonomy.

40|$|A vehicle {{simulation}} is "surface-interacting" if {{the state}} of the vehicle (position, velocity, and acceleration) relative to the surface is important. Surface-interacting simulations perform ascent, entry, descent, landing, surface travel, or atmospheric flight. The dynamics of surface-interacting simulations are influenced by the modeling of gravity. Gravity is the sum of gravitation and the centrifugal acceleration due to the world s rotation. Both components are functions of position relative to the world s center and that position for a given set of geodetic coordinates (latitude, longitude, and altitude) depends on the <b>world</b> <b>model</b> (<b>world</b> shape and dynamics). Thus, gravity fidelity depends on the fidelities of the gravitation <b>model</b> and the <b>world</b> <b>model</b> and on the interaction of the gravitation and <b>world</b> <b>model.</b> A surface-interacting simulation cannot treat the gravitation separately from the <b>world</b> <b>model.</b> This paper examines the actual performance of different pairs of <b>world</b> and gravitation <b>models</b> (or direct gravity models) on the travel of a subsonic civil transport in level flight under various starting conditions...|$|R

In general, a <b>world</b> <b>model</b> {{can serve as}} a central component in autonomous and cognitive systems for integrating, storing and disseminating information about an observed environment. Thus, a <b>world</b> <b>model</b> creates an abstract, simplified representation of an observed real-world domain. For allowing high-level information processing on a semantic layer, representations of real-world entities can be semantically enriched by domain models. In general, a domain model contains only a fixed number of a priori defined concepts from a closed world. However, in many real-life applications, the considered environment is not closed. For coping with changing environments, a cognitive system must be equipped with an adaptive <b>world</b> <b>model</b> able to adjust to an observed open environment.

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{unanswered}} questions {{about the nature and}} development of the Late Neolithic in Orkney, a summary is given of research up to 2015 on the major site at the Ness of Brodgar, Mainland, concentrating on the impressive buildings. Finding sufficient samples for radiocarbon dating was a considerable challenge. There are indications from both features and finds of activity predating the main set of buildings exposed so far by excavation. Forty-six dates on 39 samples are presented and are interpreted in a formal chronological framework. Two models are presented, reflecting different possible readings of the sequence. Both indicate that piered architecture was in use by the 30 th century cal BC and that the massive Structure 10, not the first building in the sequence, was also in existence by the 30 th century cal BC. Activity associated with piered architecture came to an end (in <b>Model</b> <b>2)</b> c. 2800 cal BC. Midden and rubble infill followed. After an appreciable interval, the hearth at the centre of Structure 10 was last used c. 2500 cal BC, perhaps the only activity in an otherwise abandoned site. The remains of some 400 or more cattle were deposited over the ruins of Structure 10 : in <b>Model</b> <b>2,</b> in the mid- 25 th century cal BC, but in Model 1 in the late 24 th or 23 rd century cal BC. The chronologies invite comparison with the near-neighbour of Barnhouse, in use from the later 32 nd to the earlier 29 th century cal BC, and the Stones of Stenness, probably constructed by the 30 th century cal BC. The Ness, including Structure 10, appears to have outlasted Barnhouse, but probably did not endure in its primary form for as long as previously envisaged.
