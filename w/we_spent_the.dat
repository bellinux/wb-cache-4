500|$|As {{they grew}} older Madonna {{and her sisters}} would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began {{drifting}} farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come {{to think that she}} resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with Sylvia Plath being her favourite. Later, Madonna commented: [...] "We were all wounded {{in one way or another}} by , and then <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself." [...] Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. [...] "Her death had taught [...] a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own—and wanted to be the queen of her own castle." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{his funeral}} service, {{his body was}} cremated. His {{brothers}} Barry and Robin ceased performing as a group for a time, but later decided to perform occasionally under the Bee Gees banner before twin brother Robin died of liver and kidney failure after a long battle with colorectal cancer on 20 May 2012. Barry and Robin Gibb told the BBC about Maurice's death, [...] "The {{fact that they had}} to operate on Maurice during the shock of cardiac arrest is questionable." [...] Barry said [...] "None of the sequence of events have yet made sense to us." [...] Robin Gibb spoke to Mojo magazine about Maurice's death in 2003: [...] "We were kids together, and teenagers. <b>We</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> whole of our lives with each other because of our music. I can't accept that he's dead. I just imagine he's alive somewhere else." ...|$|E
2500|$|Under the {{occupation}} Bunin never ceased writing but, according to Zurov, [...] "published {{not a single}} word. He was receiving offers to contribute to newspapers in unoccupied Switzerland, but declined them. Somebody visited him once, a guest who {{proved to be an}} agent, and proposed some literary work, but again Ivan Alekseyevich refused." [...] On 24 September 1944, Bunin wrote to Nikolai Roshchin: [...] "Thank God, the Germans fled Grasse without a fight, on August 23. In the early morning of the 24th the Americans came. What {{was going on in the}} town, and in our souls, that's beyond description." [...] "For all this hunger, I'm glad <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> War years in the South, sharing the life and difficulties of the people, I'm glad that we've managed even to help some", Vera Muromtseva-Bunina later wrote.|$|E
6000|$|... “Yes,” said Jimmy softly. “I’m {{sorry for}} him. He’s {{a man you}} soon feel a strong liking for; {{and there was a}} good deal to admire in his father. In fact, we were on very {{friendly}} terms during the last few days <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> at <b>the</b> wreck.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has been}} a {{fortunate}} journey for us both," [...] Dias said, [...] "and I shall always look back to <b>the</b> time <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> together with <b>the</b> greatest pleasure." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{had already}} passed by broad {{daylight}} {{the scene of}} our encampment at Coos Falls, and at length we pitched our camp on the west bank, {{in the northern part}} of Merrimack, nearly opposite to the large island on which <b>we</b> had <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> noon in our way up the river.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> {{afternoon}} pitching camp on an aspen knoll, with water, grass, {{and wood}} near at hand, and the splendid view of mountains and valleys below.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{cannot be}} helped," [...] he said. [...] "The {{only thing we}} can do is to conceal the fact that <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> night beneath this tent alone." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{were all}} excited. <b>We</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> evening speculating on the {{possible}} contents of the chest, and Cecily dreamed miserably that night that the moths had eaten everything in it.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} when I have enjoyed a week so much as <b>the</b> time <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> at <b>the</b> Chace, Rupert. Your {{grandfather}} is a wonderful old man, as hard as iron; and your lady mother was most kind and cordial. She clearly bore no malice for my interference in her love affair some years ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|She leaned {{towards him}} and dropped {{her voice a}} little. [...] "Tell me," [...] she begged, [...] "do {{you ever think of}} <b>the</b> years <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> {{together}} in <b>the</b> country? Do you ever regret?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> lads <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> {{entire day}} roaming {{here and there}} {{throughout}} the encampment without hindrance, and I had even grown so bold that I went up to Silver Heels while she was tethered {{on the bank of}} the river, caressing her silky nose as she whinnied with delight at being with me once more.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{carnival}} time, you know," [...] said Miriam, {{as if in}} {{explanation of}} Donatello's and her own costume. [...] "Do you remember how merrily <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> Carnival, last year?" ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{not very}} {{agreeable}} work, but {{for the sake of}} being near him, {{and at the same time}} to please Captain Hannock, I lent a hand, and <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the day together.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a {{new role}} for Sedgwick," [...] she remarked. [...] "When he has finished, we are going into the cathedral to hear the music. I'm fond of churches, and <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> {{afternoon}} in Notre Dame." ...|$|E
60|$|We return {{slowly through}} the city, where <b>we</b> have <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> whole day, from nine till four o'clock. We linger on the way, imploring Ventisei {{if there is not}} {{something}} to be seen in this or that house; we make our weariness an excuse for sitting down, and cannot rend ourselves from the bliss of being in Pompeii.|$|R
6000|$|They {{returned}} hand-in-hand, and the Bellman, unmanned [...] (For a moment) with noble emotion, [...] Said [...] "This amply repays all the wearisome days [...] <b>We</b> have <b>spent</b> on <b>the</b> billowy ocean!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Jodi Walker of Entertainment Weekly gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} episode, stating: [...] "Because this show, in between all the creepy, killer families and Russian mystery men, always ends up boiling down to the relationships. That’s why tonight worked so well on both the big and small scale. Even in <b>the</b> little time <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> with <b>the</b> Kings, those were some juicy family dynamics." ...|$|R
60|$|It was Friday, but we {{were not}} to begin going to school again until Monday, so <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> day in the granary, sorting apples and hearing tales. In the evening the rain ceased, the wind came around to the northwest, {{freezing}} suddenly, and a chilly yellow sunset beyond the dark hills seemed to herald a brighter morrow.|$|E
60|$|Blondin {{laughed and}} went off to attend to his nose in the men's house, {{accompanied}} by the others, while we set to work to clean ourselves and our abode. Thereafter, with moderated fire, we again got under our buffalo robes, where <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> remainder of a disturbed night in thinking and dreaming about the thrilling contents of the winter packet.|$|E
60|$|In July {{he made a}} {{pleasure}} trip in one of Sir Donald Currie’s steamers, from London to Dartmouth. “We set out at 10.20,” he says, “for the docks. Started in the Dublin Castle at noon. <b>We</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> night at the Nore, good weather, kind reception, splendid fare. The Cape deputies came with us as far as Gravesend.” Among these deputies was Mr. Kruger.|$|E
6000|$|That night again <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> at <b>the</b> Lakeside Hotel. In {{the small}} {{hours of the}} morning, as I lay awake and meditated, a thought broke across me. I was so excited by it that I rose and rushed into my brother-in-law's bedroom. [...] "Charles, Charles!" [...] I exclaimed, [...] "we have taken too much for granted once more. Perhaps Elihu Quackenboss carried off your dispatch-box!" ...|$|R
60|$|So, {{since it}} was {{dangerous}} to linger, lest the darkness should overtake us on our return journey, we descended the peak again, reaching the cave about sunset. The next four days <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> in <b>the</b> same way. Every morning we crawled up those wearisome banks of snow, and every afternoon we slid and tobogganed down them again, till I grew heartily tired of the exercise.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{wish we had}} stayed," [...] said March, idly humoring a {{conception}} of the accomplished fact. [...] "Mrs. Green would have let us have the gimcrackery very cheap for the summer months; and we could have made all sorts of nice little excursions and trips off and been twice as well as if <b>we</b> had <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> summer away." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have I {{not already}} told you," [...] she said, [...] "that {{he left the}} cottage in the country, where <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> week-end, before half-past seven this morning? Naturally, therefore, I did not see him. The servants, however, noticed nothing unusual. Last night Mr. Chetwode here was with us, and he {{can tell you what}} was {{apparent}} to all of us. Mr. Weatherley seemed then in excellent health and spirits." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> evening delightfully, {{the more}} so {{that we were not}} likely to have such an {{opportunity}} again, as the Prince of Wales would shortly part company from us, and direct her course to Moose Factory, in James Bay, while we should proceed across Hudson Bay to York Factory. We left the ship just as a few cats-paws {{on the surface of the}} water gave indications of a coming breeze.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> {{evening in}} talking over these things, and also various topics {{relating}} to the antislavery movement. Mr. Sturge was very confident that something more was to be done than had ever been done yet, by combinations for the encouragement of free, {{in the place of}} slave-grown, produce; a question which has, ever since the days of Clarkson, more or less deeply occupied the minds of abolitionists in England.|$|E
60|$|Henry has {{developed}} rheumatism in his back, ten skins have peeled off {{my hands and}} the eleventh is now peeling, while Tehei is more lunatic than ever and day and night prays God not to kill him. Also, Nakata and I are slashing away at fever again. And finally up to date, Nakata last evening had an attack of ptomaine poisoning, and <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> half <b>the</b> night pulling him through.|$|R
50|$|Lynch {{toured the}} spring of 2010 with Souls of <b>We</b> and <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> summer and winter touring with Lynch Mob. In the summer of 2010 Souls of We changed their line-up and were forced to {{discontinue}} with the name. Fan members of the Lynch website {{are being asked to}} think up a new name as the project itself would be continuing with a new name and musicians.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> have <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> {{past four}} months {{up here on}} top of a breezy hill, six hundred feet high, some few miles from Elmira, N. Y., and {{overlooking}} that town; (Elmira is my wife's birthplace and that of Susie and the new baby). This little summer house on the hill-top (named Quarry Farm because there's a quarry on it,) belongs to my wife's sister, Mrs. Crane.|$|R
6000|$|... "She's crazy about, it. That's {{what made}} it so awkward when I happened--quite inadvertently--to give it this sort of {{accidental}} shove. Well, <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> {{rest of the day}} trying to get her on the 'phone at her apartment, and finally we heard that she had come here. So I took the next train, and tried to persuade her to come back. She wouldn't listen. And that's how matters stand." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> next forenoon in camp {{to let our}} horses feed up, and {{incidentally}} to rest our own weary bones. All the forenoon great, gray clouds crushed {{against the}} divide behind us, flinging themselves in rage against the rocks like hungry vultures baffled in their chase. We exulted over their impotence. [...] "We are done with you, you storms of the Skeena--we're out of your reach at last!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{country about}} Lynton is wonderfully beautiful, with rocks and valleys, and velvet lawns {{running into the}} sea, and woods and ancestral mansions, and <b>we</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> day seeing all this, and also going down to Lynmouth, where the little ships lie high and dry on the sand when the tide goes out, and the carts drive {{up to them and}} put goods on board, and when the tide rises the ships sail away, which is very convenient.|$|E
50|$|On April 5, 2008, Wood was {{designated}} for assignment by the Marlins {{to open a}} roster spot for the recently re-acquired <b>Wes</b> Helms. He <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> rest of the season, his final as a professional, back with the Isotopes.|$|R
40|$|I {{will begin}} this article with a {{pertinent}} story from my tenure as a mediocre {{graduate student in}} Physics. A fellow student and I were working together on a homework set. <b>We</b> had <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> majority of the day on a particularly difficult problem {{that resulted in a}} lengthy equation expressed in terms of assorted variables.

6000|$|... "I've {{tried to}} do my duty as I saw it, and it comes to this--that <b>we</b> who have <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> best years of our lives in striving to develop this country have no thanks from our {{children}} or from any one else." ...|$|R
