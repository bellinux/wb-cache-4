For example, 0, 3, 7, 13, 20, 28, 36, 43, 47, 45, 32, 0, −64, n2 minus the nth Fibonacci number, is a sequence that is technically not in the OEIS, but the very similar sequence 0, −3, −7, −13, −20, −28, −36, −43, −47, −45, −32, 0, 64, is in the OEIS and <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> when one searches for its reversed signs counterpart.|$|E
500|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the indoor-outdoor {{thermometer}} is to allow the outside temperature to be indicated inside a building, thus removing the need to go outside to take a temperature reading. [...] They are also used in vehicles, and are particularly useful for municipal vehicles involved in snow and ice clearance. Building maintenance engineers can use an indoor-outdoor thermometer that has not been installed to get a quick reading of air temperature in a location inside a building. [...] This is done by swinging the bulb of the outdoor sensor in the air while still attached to the instrument. This will get a faster reading because the bulb <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> to temperature much more quickly than the indoor sensor built into the instrument.|$|E

500|$|In 1999 Hippe became Editor-in-Chief of Økonomisk Rapport (ØR). Hippe openly {{supported}} the Labour Party Prime Minister of Norway, Jens Stoltenberg from mid 2000 in Stoltenberg's first term (17 March 2000 to 19 October 2001). Hippe believed the government needed {{to spend more}} money from the Norwegian oil fund, saying: [...] "The greatest paradox today is that the government refuses to investigate what it will mean to buy goods and services abroad in fear that someone <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with the idea of spending more money than we do today. The government plays with the lives of the sick and aggravates children's education because of the dogma that oil money cannot be used". Hippe left his position as Editor-in-Chief in 2002 because the new owners did not share the same future plans for the magazine as he did. He was succeeded by Joachim Bamrud. Six months after Hippe left a number of journalists and most of the old leadership staff had also left the magazine.|$|E

[...] Scully said he was [...] "the main reason" [...] why The Simpsons [...] still so good after all these years." [...] Vitti has said Meyer's [...] "fingerprints are on nearly every script" [...] and he [...] "exerts as much influence on the show as anyone can without {{being one of the}} creators," [...] while recounting how [...] "a show that you have the writer's credit for will run, and the next day people <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> to you and tell you how great it was.

500|$|The {{effect of}} Shelby's advent on Puck evoked the most praise. Benigno called the segment where Puck meets Beth [...] "the best scene {{of this very}} young season", The Hollywood Reporter Lesley Goldberg {{said it was a}} [...] "top moment", and Abby West of Entertainment Weekly dubbed it [...] "the sweetest scene of the night". VanDerWerff also called it [...] "very sweet" [...] and {{expressed}} hope that [...] "the show <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with something for him to do after mostly relegating him to weird comic relief last season." [...] The effect of her return on Quinn was greeted with less enthusiasm. Reiter was [...] "not thrilled" [...] by the possibility of a custody battle between Quinn and Shelby and called Quinn's plan [...] "half-baked", and Canning dismissed it as [...] "clichéd drama". Kubicek expressed interest in seeing [...] "where this goes", and VanDerWerff noted that Quinn has been [...] "grieving giving up her child all this time and she didn't even know it", and characterized it as a [...] "fairly powerful storyline".|$|E
500|$|Developers tasked both art and map design {{personnel}} {{with creating}} levels, ensuring visual quality. Hall implemented a [...] "grow as you play" [...] philosophy, choosing to show certain features and statistics (like [...] "Beat" [...] {{or the use}} of MysTech) only after the player enabled their use. Developers sought to make the game accessible to expert and casual players through two statistic displays—numerical or qualitative (using categories such as [...] "very good" [...] or [...] "bad"). Hall disparaged complicated number systems found in other games: [...] "One of the things I hate about RPGs is, you've got, like, 'here's this thing and here's that thing' and it's like 'this is 52 and that's 53' I mean, what's the difference? It's like, OK it's 'a point,' and the formula <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> to be like 'two points' and like, sure, that's going to make a difference. So now I have to hit the guy three times..." [...] Hall also sought to ensure players knew their next goal, and invented the character of Fatima Doohan to keep track of missions. Fatima's name is a pun born from the phrase, [...] "What am I doing?" [...] Hall named her after the experience of loading an old saved game in an RPG and having forgotten what comes next in the current quest or storyline.|$|E
500|$|In March 2011, Spears's manager Larry Rudolph told MTV News {{that the}} tour {{would have a}} [...] "post-apocalyptic vibe", and commented that [...] "Till The World Ends" [...] "keeps {{becoming}} a theme for us." [...] He also confirmed Jamie King as the tour director and Brian Friedman as the choreographer. The following month, Friedman {{announced that he had}} pulled out of the tour due to scheduling conflicts with his own reality series. In a video interview posted on Spears's official website, she said, [...] "The Femme Fatale Tour will hopefully just be outrageously spectacular. I'm just hoping that the choreographers <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with just the most outrageous things, and I'm really excited. This {{is one of the most}} excited I've been about a project in a really long time, so I can't wait." [...] The script of the show was created by Jamie King, and was inspired by the concept of the femme fatale and femme fatales throughout the ages. Rudolph stated that the idea for the show was to have Spears as an [...] "international woman of mystery". The setlist was composed mostly of songs from Femme Fatale, but also included hits from her previous albums, as Spears explained, [...] "The fans really like a lot of the old songs, because that's what they are used to. So it's just about finding the balance, and how many songs I wanna incorporate from the past and from the present." ...|$|E

2500|$|For instance, {{suppose we}} have a {{radioactive}} sample that emits, on average, five particles every ten minutes. [...] We take measurements of how many particles the sample emits over ten-minute periods. [...] The measurements exhibit different values of k, and if the sample behaves according to Poisson statistics, then each value of k <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> in a proportion given by the probability mass function above. [...] From measurement to measurement, however, λ remains constant at 5. [...] If we do not alter the system, then the parameter λ is unchanged from measurement to measurement; if, on the other hand, we modulate the system by replacing the sample with a more radioactive one, then the parameter λ would increase.|$|E

[...] It's based on many hotels in Los Angeles... Angel lived in a larger suite in the hotel, like a honeymoon suite, the producers wanted Angel to have enough room to relax and {{get away from it}} all, do a little pondering, a little brooding, and a little research.

2500|$|Now {{consider}} {{the example of}} a coin toss. Assuming the probability of heads {{is the same as the}} probability of tails, then the entropy of the coin toss is as high as it could be. This is because there is no way to predict the outcome of the coin toss ahead of time: if we have to choose, the best we can do is predict that the coin <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> heads, and this prediction will be correct with probability 1/2. Such a coin toss has one bit of entropy since there are two possible outcomes that occur with equal probability, and learning the actual outcome contains one bit of information. In contrast, a coin toss using a coin that has two heads and no tails has zero entropy since the coin will always come up heads, and the outcome can be predicted perfectly. Analogously, one binary-outcome with equiprobable values has a Shannon entropy of [...] bit. Similarly, one trit with equiprobable values contains [...] (about 1.58496) bits of information because it can have one of three values.|$|E
2500|$|Bilingual lexical {{access is}} an area in {{psycholinguistics}} research that studies the activation or retrieval process of the mental lexicon for people who can speak two languages. Bilingual lexical access {{can be understood as}} all aspects of word processing, including all the mental activity from the perception of the word from one language until all its lexical knowledge from the target language is available. Research in this field seeks to fully understand these mental processes. Bilingual individuals have two mental lexical representations for an item or concept and are able to successfully select words from one language without significant interference from the other language. Thus, {{it is important to understand}} whether these dual representations interact or affect one another. Bilingual lexical access researchers focus on the control mechanisms bilinguals use to suppress the language not in use when in a monolingual mode and the degree to which the related representations within the language not in use are activated. [...] For example, when a Dutch-English bilingual is asked to name a picture of a dog in English, he or she <b>will</b> <b>come</b> <b>up</b> with the English word dog. Bilingual lexical access is the mental process that underlies this seemingly simple task: the process that makes the connection between the [...] "idea" [...] dog and the word dog in the target language. While activating the English word dog, the Dutch word hond (its equivalent in Dutch), is most likely also in a state of activation.|$|E
