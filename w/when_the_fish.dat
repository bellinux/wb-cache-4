5|$|Its {{toxicity}} {{is due to}} tetrodotoxin, {{which is}} concentrated particularly in the liver, ovaries, intestines and skin. Many species of pufferfish bear this toxin, obtaining it from tetrodotoxin-containing bacteria in their diet. Eating the fish can have fatal consequences. The symptoms of poisoning, which are predominantly neurological, include ataxia, in addition to numbness and/or paraesthesia (tingling) around the mouth, lips, and limb extremities. Cases of pets being poisoned have occurred <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> have been left where they can eat them.|$|E

An indistinct silver-yellow mid-lateral band extends across some specimens. The spinous dorsal fin is olive green with faint darker blotches, the second dorsal fin also a pale olive with rows of dark brown to blackish spots. The anal and ventral fins are pale yellow, the pectorals are pale yellow to pale brown with a well defined dark blue-black blotch at the base. The caudal fin is yellow to olive in colour with darker margins. Juveniles less than 90mm may have darker blotches along their sides and backs.|$|E
5|$|The Bhagavata Purana and the Kathasaritsagara continue, that on {{advice of}} Shiva, Rati assumes {{the form of}} Sambara's kitchen-maid Mayavati and awaits her husband's arrival in Sambara's house. Sambara is foretold that the reborn Kama would be his destroyer. Sambara finds out that Kama was born as Pradyumna, the son of Krishna and his wife Rukmini. He steals the child and throws him in the ocean, where the child is {{swallowed}} by a fish. This fish is caught by fishermen and sent to Sambara's kitchen. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> is cut, the child is found by Mayavati, who decides to nurture him. The divine sage Narada reveals to Mayavati that she was Rati and the child was Kama and she was to rear him. As the child grew up, the motherly love of Mayavati changes to the passionate love of a wife. The reborn Kama resents her advances, as he considers her his mother. Mayavati tells him the secret of their previous births as narrated by Narada {{and that he was}} not her son, but that of Krishna and Rukmini. Mayavati trains Pradyumna in magic and war and advises him to kill Sambara. Pradyumna defeats Sambara and slays him. He returns to Dvārakā, Krishna's capital with Mayavati as his wife, where they are welcomed.|$|E

25|$|Most mesopelagic fish make daily {{vertical}} migrations, {{moving at}} night into the epipelagic zone, often following similar migrations of zooplankton, {{and returning to}} the depths for safety during the day. These vertical migrations often occur over a large vertical distances, and are undertaken {{with the assistance of}} a swimbladder. The swimbladder is inflated <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> wants to move up, and, given the high pressures in the messoplegic zone, this requires significant energy. As the fish ascends, the pressure in the swimbladder must adjust to prevent it from bursting. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> wants to return to the depths, the swimbladder is deflated. Some mesopelagic fishes make daily migrations through the thermocline, where the temperature changes between 10 and 20°C, thus displaying considerable tolerances for temperature change.|$|E

25|$|The swimbladders of {{deep sea}} fish are either absent or {{scarcely}} operational, and bathypelagic fish do not normally undertake vertical migrations.

25|$|Coloration can vary, as blackeye gobies {{are capable}} of rapidly {{changing}} color during social interactions and for camouflage. The basic body color is creamy white to pale tan, but can become a mottled dark purple-brown. The body is irregularly speckled with metallic blue-green. Below the eye is an iridescent bluish spot clearly visible if illuminated (the source of their other common name – bluespot goby). The first dorsal fin has a distinctive black upper anterior edge that is retained even <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> changes color.

When Ole Vandsvik was one of the owners Anna Karoline started the new year with a voyage to Lofoten to buy fish.

25|$|Birds {{that fish}} by stealth from {{above the water}} have to correct for {{refraction}} particularly <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> are observed at an angle. Reef herons and little egrets appear {{to be able to}} make the corrections needed when capturing fish and are more successful in catching fish when strikes are made at an acute angle and this higher success may be due to the inability of the fish to detect their predators. Other studies indicate that egrets work within a preferred angle of strike and that the probability of misses increase when the angle becomes too far from the vertical leading to an increased difference between the apparent and real depth of prey.|$|E

The research employed four types of fishing gears, i. e. purse seine, cantrang,gillnet and boat-liftnet with five replicates each. Five species of the dominant catch were taken for qualitydetermination on-board, at landing sites, and after auctioning. The condition of handling facilities andmethods were evaluated. Fish transit time (time lapse between <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> lifting and auction process) was also determined.

25|$|The {{bar jack}} has a gray to grayish blue upper {{body with a}} silvery tint, which fades ventrally to a white belly. As {{indicated}} by their common name, adult bar jack have a horizontal stripe running along their back and through the lower lobe of the caudal fin. This bar is a golden brownish to blackish color, often with an electric blue bar running parallel immediately underneath it. All other fins are pale dusky to hyaline. Juveniles have up to 6 dark bands on their body and a darker lower caudal lobe than the upper lobe, foreshadowing the bar that develops at a later stage. At these early stages, they are difficult to distinguish from Carangoides bartholomaei, with the best identifier being gill raker counts. The entire body has been observed to change colour to a blackish colour <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> is feeding near the bottom.|$|E
25|$|Other senses {{are also}} used. Pheromones or sound may {{also play a}} part but {{supporting}} evidence has not been found so far. The lateral line is a line running along {{each side of the}} fish from the gill covers {{to the base of the}} tail. In laboratory experiments the lateral lines of schooling fish have been removed. They swam closer, leading to a theory that the lateral lines provide additional stimuli input <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> get too close. The lateral-line system is very sensitive to changes in water currents and vibration in the water. It uses receptors called neuromasts, each of which is composed of a group of hair cells. The hairs are surrounded by a protruding jelly-like cupula, typically 0.1 to 0.2mm long. The hair cells in the lateral line are similar to the hair cells inside the vertebrate inner ear, indicating that the lateral line and the inner ear share a common origin.|$|E
25|$|Corydoras panda has an off-white to pinkish-orange ground colour, {{and when}} {{observed}} under certain lighting conditions, a faint greenish iridescence is present upon the flanks and the operculum. The fins {{of the fish}} match the body in ground colour, upon close inspection being seen to be hyaline or translucent with coloured fin rays, with the dorsal fin being marked by a conspicuous black blotch that covers almost the entire fin area. The caudal peduncle is marked with a black band, this black band encircling the caudal peduncle from dorsal to ventral surface. The adipose fin, supported by a small fin spine, sometimes contains black pigmentation. The head is the same ground colour as the body, with a black mask surrounding the eyes, descending vertically from the fontanel, over each eye, and ending in a triangular wedge immediately before the ventral surface of the head. The pectoral fins are positioned immediately behind the operculum, and are usually oriented horizontally <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>fish</b> is at rest, extended {{in a manner similar}} to the wings of an aeroplane. The pelvic fins are positioned upon the ventral surface of the fish, located some way behind the pectoral fins. The first ray of the dorsal fin emanates from the body at approximately its point of greatest elevation, and a vertical line drawn downwards from this point meets the attachment point of the pelvic fins. The anal fin is located far to the rear of the ventral surface of the body, the attachment point of the first fin ray being somewhat forward of the black caudal peduncle marking described above.|$|E
