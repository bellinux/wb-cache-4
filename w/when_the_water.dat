5|$|Although not well-studied, {{there is}} growing {{acceptance}} of three species of Malagasy hippopotamus. It is not known when or exactly how these hippos arrived {{on the island of}} Madagascar. As hippos are semi-aquatic, it is possible that they survived the 400km (248mi) trek across the channel, although presumably <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> was shallower and there were perhaps small islands along the way. It is possible that the three species of hippopotamus represent three distinct and successful colonizations of the island. Hippos are the only endemic ungulates ever to have lived on Madagascar.|$|E

5|$|Although it {{has been}} {{reported}} from a depth of , the blacktip reef shark is usually found in water only a few meters deep, and can often be seen swimming close to shore with its dorsal fin exposed. Younger sharks prefer shallow, sandy flats, while older sharks are most common around reef ledges and can also be found near reef drop-offs. This species has also been reported from brackish estuaries and lakes in Madagascar, and freshwater environments in Malaysia, though it is not able to tolerate low salinity to the same degree as the bull shark (C.leucas). At Aldabra in the Indian Ocean, blacktip reef sharks congregate in the channels between reef flats during low tide and travel to the mangroves <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> rises. There is equivocal evidence that sharks from the northern and southern extremes of its distribution are migratory.|$|E
5|$|American {{alligators}} {{are less}} vulnerable to cold than American crocodiles. Unlike an American crocodile, which would immediately succumb to the cold and drown in water at , an American alligator can survive in such temperatures for some time without displaying any signs of discomfort.

In fact, the American alligator is found farther from the equator and is more equipped to handle cooler conditions than any other crocodilian. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> begins to freeze, American alligators stick their snouts through the surface which allows them to breathe above the ice.|$|E
5|$|An {{independent}} study revealed {{the water to}} be radioactive and potentially dangerous to drink, initially surrounding the project with controversy.

The Ministry said the {{independent study}} was inaccurate, as it did not test water from any of the wells that will be used in the project. The President of the Jordanian Geologists Association Bahjat Al Adwan stated that the radiation is present in the water in the form of Radon, and thus dissipates harmlessly <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> is exposed to air on the surface.|$|E

5|$|Fossil Springs, {{the source}} of about 80percent {{of the water in}} Fossil Creek, issues from several vents in close {{proximity}} to one another {{at the base of the}} Mogollon Rim. The rim is the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau. Water percolating through limestone layers in the rim becomes laden with dissolved carbon dioxide and calcium carbonate. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> emerges at the springs, it begins to release carbon dioxide as a gas and calcium carbonate as travertine, a porous form of calcite often found around hot springs such as Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park. The release, affected by stream turbulence and other factors, does not occur all at once but continues downstream.|$|E

5|$|In 1642 the English Civil War {{broke out}} between the Royalist {{supporters}} of Charles I and those of Parliament. South Wales was predominantly Royalist in sympathy, and during the conflict, a sconce, or small fort, was built overlooking Caerphilly Castle to the north-west, {{on the site of}} the old Roman fort. It is uncertain if this was built by Royalist forces or by the Parliamentary army that occupied the area during the final months of the war in March 1646, but the fort's guns would have dominated the interior of the castle. It is also uncertain whether or not Caerphilly Castle was deliberately slighted by Parliament to prevent its future use as a fortification. Although several towers had collapsed by the 18th century, possibly as a result of such an operation, it is probable that this deterioration was actually the result of subsidence damage caused <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> defences retreated, as there is no evidence of deliberate destruction having been ordered.|$|E
5|$|In 1967 U.S. recon {{photographs}} uncovered {{an unusual}} sight. POL barrels were spotted {{floating in the}} waters of the Kong River south of Ban Bak, Laos. Soon, PAVN was making use of the Banghiang River which flowed southwestward from the Demilitarized Zone {{all the way to the}} Mekong River, for the same purposes. The watertight drums were launched en masse from tributary streams into the main channel, floated downstream, and were recovered by systems of nets and booms. The Kaman River was added to the system in 1969. By 1970 the North Vietnamese were making intense use of streams and rivers to supplement their logistical route, especially in the rainy season, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> levels rose and the roadways became impassable mires. During one two and one-half month period during 1969, over 10,000 POL barrels were spotted in the waterways of southeastern Laos.|$|E
5|$|Most {{neptunium}} (and plutonium) now {{encountered in}} the environment is due to atmospheric nuclear explosions that took place between the detonation of the first atomic bomb in 1945 and the ratification of the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty in 1963. The total amount of neptunium released by these explosions and the few atmospheric tests that {{have been carried out}} since 1963 is estimated to be around 2500kg. The overwhelming majority of this is composed of the long-lived isotopes 236Np and 237Np since even the moderately long-lived 235Np (half-life 396days) would have decayed to less than one-billionth (10−9) its original concentration over the intervening decades. An additional very small amount of neptunium, created by neutron irradiation of natural uranium in nuclear reactor cooling water, is released <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> is discharged into rivers or lakes. The concentration of 237Np in seawater is approximately 6.5×10−5millibecquerels per liter: this concentration is between 0.1% and 1% that of plutonium.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent uplift of the Colorado Plateau and tilting of the Markagunt Plateau started 13million years ago. This steepened {{the stream}} {{gradient}} of the ancestral Virgin River (Zion Canyon {{section of the}} park), and Taylor and La Verkin creeks (Kolob Canyons section of the park), causing them to flow and downcut faster into the underlying Markagunt Plateau. Downcutting continues to be especially rapid after heavy rainstorms and winter runoff <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> contains large amounts of suspended and abrasive sand grains. Uplift and downcutting are so fast that slot canyons (very narrow river-cut features with vertical walls), such as the Zion Narrows, formed.|$|E
5|$|The John Day River, which {{passes through}} the Sheep Rock Unit, is the longest undammed {{tributary}} of the Columbia River, although two Columbia River dams below the John Day River mouth impede migratory fish travel to some degree. Chinook salmon and steelhead pass through the monument {{on their way to}} and from upstream spawning beds and the Pacific Ocean. Species observed at the Sheep Rock Unit also include those able to tolerate warm summer river temperatures: bridgelip suckers, northern pikeminnow, redside shiners, and smallmouth bass. From October through June, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> is cooler, Columbia River redband trout and sculpin are among species that move downriver through the park. The Park Service has removed or replaced irrigation diversions along the river or Rock Creek that formerly impeded fish movement, and it is restoring riparian vegetation such as black cottonwood trees that shade the water in summer and provide habitat for aquatic insects.|$|E
5|$|The {{life-cycle}} of the phumdis {{has generally}} been subject to seasonal variation. During the monsoon season <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>water</b> level is high, the phumdis float, but during the dry season, as the water level falls, the phumdis touch the lake bed and absorb nutrients from it. When the wet season returns, they again float, and the biomass, which has enough nutrients stored in the plants' roots, survives. However, the contemporary situation, with high water levels in the lake throughout the year, has meant {{that the process of}} 'feeding' on lakebottom nutrients has been seriously disturbed, resulting in a loss of biomass and a thinning of the islands each year. In January 1999, it was reported that a large section of phumdi in the north of the park had shattered into pieces and drifted away from the park area, threatening the habitat of the sangai.|$|E
