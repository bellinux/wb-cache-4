500|$|Eurogamer Schilling {{called the}} self-referential {{nature of the}} release a [...] "very postmodern conceit", which he thought worked well despite the dual faux pas of parodying The Matrix and overtly [...] "satirizing game mechanics".

Patterson of Electronic Gaming Monthly noted that those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>for</b> cost benefit would be disappointed by lack of content, especially those who had already finished the main game, but he was interested in Enter the Dominatrix for its behind-the-scenes aspects, which he encouraged other developers to use more often.|$|E
