25|$|Only the {{original}} <b>wingtip</b> <b>ailerons</b> from the Baddeck No. 1 still {{exist in the}} Alexander Graham Bell Museum in Baddeck.|$|R
50|$|The AEA {{produced}} {{several different}} aircraft in quick succession, with each member acting as principal designer {{for at least}} one. The group introduced key technical innovations, notably <b>wingtip</b> <b>ailerons</b> and the tricycle landing gear.|$|R
5|$|Curtiss was at {{the time}} a member of the Aerial Experiment Association (AEA), headed by Alexander Graham Bell, where in 1908 he had helped reinvent <b>wingtip</b> <b>ailerons</b> for their Aerodrome No. 2, known as the AEA White Wing (the AEA's other members became dismayed when Curtiss {{unexpectedly}} dropped out of their organization; they later came to believe he had sold the rights to their joint innovation to the United States Government).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Wingtip</b> <b>ailerons</b> {{were also}} used on the {{contemporary}} Bleriot VIII—the first known flightworthy aircraft to use the joystick and rudder bar pioneering form of modern flight controls in a single airframe, and the 1911-vintage Curtiss Model D pusher biplane had spanwise rectangular interplane ailerons of a similar nature to those on the final form of the Santos-Dumont 14-bis, but mounted on, and pivoted from the outer rear interplane struts instead.|$|R
25|$|The triplane {{design that}} was chosen {{employed}} a longer central plane with <b>wingtip</b> <b>ailerons,</b> with flying controls {{based on a}} fixed biplane tail and rudder at the rear and a canard biplane elevator section at the front. The internal structure was based on tubular-steel with linen-covered wings and interior sections; a four-wheel chassis or running gear formed the undercarriage. A Curtiss pusher engine drove a propeller through a chain and sprocket arrangement; later a Kirkham engine from the Baddeck No. 2 was substituted.|$|R
50|$|The Type 74 {{incorporated}} some of {{the innovations}} Horace Short had introduced to the Short Admiralty Type 42, including manganese-steel tube struts instead of wood. In addition to the two main rubber-sprung floats below the fuselage and the single tail float, it also had smaller floats attached below the lower <b>wingtips.</b> <b>Ailerons</b> were mounted on the upper wing only, the latter extending beyond the span of the lower wing. The extensions were braced by diagonal struts to the lower wingtips.|$|R

50|$|Sharing {{its origins}} in the {{original}} PFI requirements issued by TsAGI, the MiG-29 has broad aerodynamic similarities to the Sukhoi Su-27, however, there are some notable differences. The MiG-29 has a mid-mounted swept wing with blended leading-edge root extensions (LERXs) swept at around 40°; there are swept tailplanes and two vertical fins, mounted on booms outboard of the engines. Automatic slats are mounted on the leading edges of the wings; they are four-segment on early models and five-segment on some later variants. On the trailing edge, there are maneuvering flaps and <b>wingtip</b> <b>ailerons.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... 5 December 2015 - A Embraer ERJ 145 {{registered}} G-CGWV {{left wing}} touched the runway surface during a night landing in gusty wind conditions. Damage {{to the left}} <b>wingtip</b> and <b>aileron</b> was found after the flight. The crew were uninjured although the aircraft suffered damage.|$|R
5000|$|The Goupy No.2 was an {{experimental}} aircraft designed by Ambroise Goupy and Mario Calderara and built in France in 1909 at the Blériot factory at Buc. The Goupy No.2 is significant for two major and influential innovations in aircraft design: {{it was the}} first tractor configuration biplane to fly and the first biplane to feature staggered wings, built with a landing gear configuration nearly identical in appearance to the Blériot XI monoplane, flown earlier that year. While both these features would very soon become the norm in aircraft design, the No.2 was described in the aviation press at the time as having a [...] "somewhat unusual design". The only features that would not be typical of aircraft {{in the years to come}} would be its biplane tail unit, and the whole-chord <b>wingtip</b> <b>ailerons</b> fitted to both upper and lower wings. The uncovered wood box-girder fuselage, typical of early aircraft, was later covered.|$|R
5000|$|Model {{introduced}} in 2012, {{powered by a}} [...] Lycoming AEIO-390-A1B6 engine driving an MT-Propeller 76 in propeller. This model also has redesigned longer main landing gear legs to accommodate the longer propeller, a new airfoil-section tailplane with 10% larger area, clipped <b>wingtips</b> and greater <b>aileron</b> effectiveness.|$|R
50|$|The Nieuport 27's design closely {{followed}} the early {{form of the}} 24, including its semi-rounded rear fuselage and rounded <b>wingtips</b> and <b>ailerons.</b> The structural problems with the redesigned, rounded tail surfaces of the 24, which had resulted {{in the use of}} a Nieuport 17 type tail in the 24bis., were by now overcome, so that the new version was able to standardise on the new tail. By now most Nieuport fighters were actually used as advanced trainers, and the 130 hp Le Rhône 9J Rotary engine of the 24bis. was often replaced by a 110 or 120 hp version.|$|R
50|$|Earlier TriStar 500s were {{delivered}} {{with the standard}} wing; these were later retrofitted with <b>ailerons</b> and extended <b>wingtips.</b> Pan Am was the first customer to order the -500 with the extended <b>wingtips</b> and active <b>ailerons.</b> Msn 1176, the first for Pan Am, was the first TriStar 500 to be fitted with them as standard.|$|R
50|$|First {{trials were}} made at Issy-les-Moulineaux on 7 July but the {{aircraft}} failed to lift off. Blériot then enlarged the wings slightly, and on 11 July a short successful flight of around 25-30 metres (84-100 ft) was made, reaching an altitude of around 2 m (7 ft). Because some onlookers were in the way Blériot then shut off the engine and landed. Although the achievement was marred by slight damage to the undercarriage, this was Blériot's first truly successful flight. Further successful flights took place that month, and by 25 July he had managed a flight of 150 m. During these flights Blériot made various modifications: he locked the <b>wingtip</b> <b>ailerons</b> and installed a sliding seat, {{so that he could}} maintain longitudinal trim by shifting the aircraft's centre of gravity, and extended the vertical tail surface. On 6 August he managed to reach an altitude of 12 m, but one of the blades of the propeller worked loose, resulting in a heavy landing which damaged the aircraft. He then fitted a 50 hp (37 kW) V-16 Antoinette engine. Tests on the 17 September showed a startling improvement in performance, with the aircraft quickly reaching an altitude of 25 m, when the engine suddenly cut out and the aircraft went into a spiralling nosedive. Blériot later said that his immediate thought was that he was finished: in desperation he climbed out of his seat and threw himself towards the tail. The aircraft partially pulled out of the dive, and came to earth in a more or less horizontal attitude. His only injuries were some minor cuts on the face, caused by fragments of glass from his broken goggles. After this crash Blériot abandoned development of the aircraft, concentrating on his next machine, the Type VII.|$|R
50|$|In {{a coordinated}} turn, adverse yaw is {{effectively}} compensated {{by the use}} of the rudder, which results in a sideforce on the vertical tail that opposes the adverse yaw by creating a favorable yawing moment. Another method of compensation is 'differential ailerons', which have been rigged such that the down-going aileron deflects less than the up-going one. In this case the opposing yaw moment is generated by a difference in profile drag between the left and right <b>wingtips.</b> Frise <b>ailerons</b> accentuate this profile drag imbalance by protruding beneath the wing of an upward-deflected aileron, most often by being hinged slightly behind the leading edge and {{near the bottom of the}} surface, with the lower section of the aileron surface's leading edge protruding slightly below the wing's undersurface when the aileron is deflected upwards, substantially increasing profile drag on that side. Ailerons may also be designed to use a combination of these methods.|$|R
2500|$|The {{design was}} an equal-span single-bay biplane with {{staggered}} parallel-chord wings with raked <b>wingtips</b> and <b>ailerons</b> fitted {{to the upper}} and lower wings, which were rigged with about half a degree of dihedral, making them look almost straight when viewed from the front. [...] The wing section was one designed by Coanda which had been used for the wings of the Bristol Coanda Biplanes. [...] The rectangular-section fuselage was an orthodox wire-braced wooden structure constructed from ash and spruce, with the forward section covered with aluminium sheeting and the rear section fabric covered. [...] It was powered by an 80hp (60kW) Gnome Lambda rotary engine enclosed in a cowling that had no open frontal area, although the bottom was cut away to allow cooling air to get to the engine. It had a rectangular balanced rudder with no fixed fin and split elevators attached to a non-lifting horizontal stabiliser. The fixed horizontal tail surfaces were outlined in steel tube with wooden ribs and the elevators constructed entirely of steel tube.|$|R
50|$|The Acrostar is a {{conventionally}} arranged {{low wing}} single engine aircraft. The wing is straight tapered, {{the leading edge}} slightly swept and the trailing edge unswept. The aerofoil section, designed by Eppler, is quite thick with a thickness to chord ratio of 20%. It is a symmetric section and mounted at zero incidence. There is also zero dihedral. Full span control surfaces are fitted, flaps inboard and proportionally moving ailerons outboard. The ailerons are balanced not by the usual horn or hinge line extensions but by small surfaces which project beyond the <b>wingtips.</b> Unusually, both <b>ailerons</b> and flaps are coupled to the elevator position; this camber changing control system, together with the highly symmetric wing, produces the same control characteristics for normal and inverted manoeuvres. The basic idea in this arrangement {{was to keep the}} centerline of the fuselage horizontal in both normal and inverted horizontal flight. The result, beside this, is good controllability in low speed ballistic flight, around zero G.|$|R
2500|$|The Skycar I {{was first}} {{displayed}} at the spring 1931 Detroit Show. The aircraft was a two-seat high-wing monoplane, accommodating the occupants in tandem layout. It had an all-metal steel-tube frame covered with corrugated metal skin. Centre-line nose and tail-wheels plus a standard landing gear were fitted. The rear fuselage was constructed from an open framework carrying a single fin and rudder, inside which was located the rear pusher engine. The Sky Car was displayed with a Moorhouse engine (Alfred Moorhouse of Detroit, assignor to Packard Motor Car Company). Fuel was carried in two tanks in the leading portion of the central section of the engine housing, from where it was fed by gravity to the engine. At a later date the aircraft was fitted with twin booms carrying the single fin and rudder (see photo of preserved aircraft). The aircraft featured balanced pivoting outboard <b>wingtips</b> rather than <b>ailerons.</b> Stout attempted to design a simple aircraft that would have controls similar to early model Fords including the ignition switch and the starter button. Stout planned to build the Sky Car (i.e. its original name was [...] "Sky Car" [...] but various newspaper and magazine articles spelled it [...] "Skycar") [...] and sell it {{at the price of}} a moderately priced car (approximately $2000) if mass-produced in numbers.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} leave a cleaner {{environmental}} space to future generations, {{the international community has}} been mobilized to find green solutions that are effective and feasible in all sectors. The CRIAQ MDO 505 project was initiated to test the morphing <b>wingtip</b> (wing and <b>aileron)</b> technology as one of these possible solutions. The main objectives of this project are: the design and manufacturing of a morphing wing prototype, the extension and control of the laminar region over the extrados, and to compare the effects of morphing and rigid aileron in terms of lift, drag and pressure distributions. The advantage of the extension of the laminar region over a wing is the drag reduction that results by delaying the transition towards its trailing edge. The location of the transition region depends on the flight case and it is controlled, for a morphing wing, via the actuators positions and displacements. Therefore, this thesis work focuses on the control of the actuators positions and displacements. This thesis presents essentially the modeling, instrumentation and wind tunnel testing results. Three series of wind tunnel tests with different values of aileron deflection angle, angle of attack and Mach number have been performed in the subsonic wind tunnel of the IAR-NRC. The used wing airfoil consisted of stringers, ribs, spars and a flexible upper surface mad of composite materials (glass fiber carbon), a rigid aileron and flexible aileron. The aileron was able to move between +/- 6 degrees. The demonstrator’s span measures 1. 5 m and its chord measures 1. 5 m. Structural analyses have been performed to determine the plies orientation, and the number of fiberglass layers for the flexible skin. These analyses allowed also to determine the actuator’s forces to push and pull the wing upper surface. The 2 D XFoil and 3 D solvers Fluent were used to find the optimized airfoil and the optimal location of the transition for each flight case. Based on the analyses done by the aerodynamic and structural teams in the MDO 5050 project, the most efficient actuators and pressure sensors to integrate inside the wing were selected. The actuators (4 in total) are attached to the ribs and placed inside of the wing to deform the upper surface thereof. The actuators are controlled by a controller whose gains were obtained with different methodologies. Pressure sensors (32 in total) were fixed in the wing upper surface in order to estimate the transition zone from the measured and analyzed data. The evaluation code for raw pressure sensors data was designed at the LARCASE using the Matlab / Simulink software...|$|R
