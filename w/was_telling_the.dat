5|$|Elizabeth {{was held}} in the YMCA for nearly 200days, during which time the Kempeitai meticulously {{followed}} up every point in her story, cross-examining people she said she had helped. After a huge dossier of interviews had been compiled, the Japanese concluded that she <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> truth and set her free. Khun Heng, however, was sentenced to 12years in Outram Road Prison. People avoided Elizabeth following her release, too terrified to speak to her. Fifteen internees died in the Kempeitais cells during the Double Tenth inquisition. The suffering spread to the entire civilian population of Changi Prison; rations were cut, and games, concerts, plays, and school lessons were forbidden for months.|$|E
5|$|In Bhattikavya, Jatayu dies in {{the arms}} of Rama without {{revealing}} that Sita is in the clutches of Ravana. After his arms are chopped, the unnamed demon – identified with Kabandha – falls and starts his counsel. The funeral pyre scene is dropped here. The demon tells Rama that Ravana abducted Sita and has taken her to Lanka. He advises Rama to form an alliance with Sugriva, without which Ravana will not be overcome. He instructs Rama to negotiate a deal with Sugriva as per which Rama will kill Vali and end Sugriva's sorrows and in return, Sugriva would mobilize his forces to defeat Ravana.

5|$|No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World's First Supermodel is an {{autobiography}} by fashion model, photographer, author and talent agent Janice Dickinson. It {{was published in}} hardcover format in 2002 by ReganBooks, an imprint of HarperCollins. The author's friend make-up artist Way Bandy advised her to begin putting her past experiences down on paper {{as a form of}} therapy from prior trauma in her life. After gaining sobriety, she started compiling her notes into book format. She contacted book publisher Judith Regan who agreed to help her publish her book after hearing her tale on the phone, without first seeing a writing sample. In November 2014, Dickinson asserted in an interview with Entertainment Tonight that pressure from Bill Cosby and his lawyers resulted in the removal of an account of sexual assault and rape by Cosby when she visited him at a hotel in Lake Tahoe, California in 1982. After Cosby's attorney disputed this account, she reappeared on the program to proclaim she <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> truth and explained she was speaking out publicly because of a need to be heard and to represent other women who stated they experienced a similar trauma.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey {{accepted}} Burchard's {{appointment in}} December 1189, but then excommunicated Burchard in January 1190. The excommunication, which was shared with Henry Marshal, was retaliation for {{a dispute with}} the archbishop-elect that happened during a church service. The actual dispute occurred on 5 January 1190 when Burchard and Marshal were conducting vespers, either early or on time, depending on whose side <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> story. Geoffrey appeared {{in the middle of}} their service and attempted to perform the same service, either late or on time, again depending on who was relating the story. When Burchard and Marshal finished their service, they put out all the lights in the church, leaving the archbishop in the dark. Despite that, he finished the service but then complained to the cathedral chapter of York about the incident. Attempts to mediate a dispute led nowhere, and the citizens of York soon became involved. Geoffrey attempted to keep the townspeople from abusing his two opponents, but Burchard was eventually forced to take refuge in the tomb of William of York, an earlier Archbishop of York. Hugh du Puiset then intervened with the king, and Geoffrey once more lost the royal favour. The king sent Burchard to Rome, along with Reginald fitzJocelin the Bishop of Bath, to attempt to secure the deposition of Geoffrey from York. Although Burchard's efforts in Rome in mid-1190 contributed to a papal prohibition on Geoffrey's consecration by Pope Clement III, Geoffrey was not deposed. Burchard did secure his own absolution of the excommunication placed by Geoffrey in January.|$|E
5|$|Twenty {{years after}} Sarah's death, Joel {{works as a}} {{smuggler}} in the Boston quarantine zone with his friend and partner Tess. While out searching for a former accomplice who stole some of their merchandise, Joel and Tess are tasked by Marlene, an acquaintance and leader of a rebel militia called the Fireflies, to smuggle Ellie to a rendezvous point at the Massachusetts State House. Making their way there, Joel discovers that Ellie is immune to the infection. Upon their arrival, Tess reveals that she has sustained a bite on the journey, and insists Joel finds Tommy {{in order to continue}} the mission. Joel is initially surly and short towards Ellie, though he begins to warm up to her as their journey continues. This is compounded when Joel, having initially asked Tommy to carry on in his place after meeting up with him at his settlement in Jackson County, Colorado, changes his mind and carries on as planned. Their bond deepens when Ellie nearly loses Joel to a severe injury, and when he comes to her aid after she is nearly killed by a band of cannibals. Ultimately, Joel shows his devotion to Ellie when he chooses to rescue her from the doctors who plan to remove and examine her brain, as opposed to allowing her to die. To ensure they are not pursued, Joel kills Marlene. Driving away, Ellie wakes up, after which Joel tells her the doctors gave up on discovering a cure. Ellie later confronts him about the events, and Joel swears to her that he <b>was</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> truth.|$|E
