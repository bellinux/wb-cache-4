5|$|By June 1992, the Nordiques {{announced}} that they were moving towards trading Lindros, and were engaged in trade discussions with the Toronto Maple Leafs, Calgary Flames, New Jersey Devils, Philadelphia Flyers, and Detroit Red Wings. The Red Wings were reported to be <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> Steve Yzerman, Steve Chiasson, and numerous draft picks to the Nordiques for Lindros. Yzerman indicated that he would also hold out from the Nordiques, should Detroit trade him to Quebec.|$|E
5|$|From {{the figure}} 8, {{it is clear}} that an economy {{operating}} at a position where the MRS of either Crusoe or Friday is not equal to the MRT between coconuts and fish cannot be Pareto efficient. This is because the rate at which, say Friday is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> coconuts for fish is different from the rate at which coconuts can be transformed into fish. Thus, {{there is a way to}} make Friday better off by rearranging the production pattern.|$|E

5|$|Houtteman {{remained}} a reliever during the 1956 Cleveland Indians season. He continued to get trade offers in 1956, though, as the Chicago White Sox were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> outfielder Jim Rivera for him. A three-team, nine-player deal involving Houtteman again {{becoming part of}} the White Sox along with George Strickland was also scrapped at the last second. Houtteman finished the 1956 season having only made 22 appearances on the mound, earning a 2–2 record. However, he had a high ERA of 6.56, his highest since 1946, when he made one appearance.|$|E
5|$|During the winter, Ellie and Joel {{shelter in}} the mountains. Joel is {{on the brink of}} death and relies on Ellie to care for him. Hunting for food, Ellie {{encounters}} David (Nolan North) and James (Reuben Langdon), scavengers <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> medicine for food; David turns hostile after revealing the university bandits were part of his group. Ellie manages to lead David's group away from Joel, but is eventually captured; David intends to recruit her into his cannibal group. Refusing the offer, she escapes after killing James, but David corners her in a burning restaurant. Meanwhile, Joel recovers from his wounds and sets out to find Ellie. He reaches Ellie as she kills David and breaks down crying; Joel comforts her before they flee.|$|E
25|$|That {{is not to}} {{say that}} the price of any good or service is simply a {{function}} of the marginal utility that it has for any one individual nor for some ostensibly typical individual. Rather, individuals are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> based upon the respective marginal utilities of the goods that they have or desire (with these marginal utilities being distinct for each potential trader), and prices thus develop constrained by these marginal utilities.|$|E

The cost of the war still weighed heavily on the Soviet economy. Beria craved the vast financial resources that another (more sustained) relationship with the United States could provide. For example, Beria gave Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania serious prospects of national autonomy, possibly similarly to other Soviet satellite states in Europe.|$|E
25|$|Carcetti {{watches a}} news {{report about the}} exhumed bodies and {{discusses}} the political implications with his staff. Norman Wilson remarks that the bodies are attributable to the Royce administration and Michael Steintorf, the new chief of staff, states that the silver lining {{of the story is}} that it draws attention away from the massive school deficit. Steintorf counsels that they should use this as cover to avoid dealing with the deficit as it would hamstring Carcetti's plans to run for governor and that Carcetti will have the funds to address the city's education problems when he becomes governor. Wilson is disappointed to see that Carcetti is <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> fulfilling his responsibilities as mayor with increasing his chances of becoming governor.|$|E
25|$|Plans {{for raising}} the wrecks resumed in 2004, after the German Museum of Technology in Berlin {{offered to pay}} {{the cost of the}} work. They lacked a He 111 in their {{collection}} and were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> an airworthy Lockheed F-104 Starfighter to the Norwegian Armed Forces Aircraft Collection in exchange for the two wrecks. Norwegian aviation museums had both a He 111 and Ju 88 and were therefore not interested in paying the cost of retrieving them. The operation received support from the municipality and the Food Safety Authority, although it was opposed by Nature and Youth and the Museum of Natural History and Archaeology, who both stated that the process could pollute more than the aircraft just lying there. The museum also questioned if sending wrecks to Germany was good heritage management.|$|E

50|$|A rapid attack isn't {{guaranteed}} to be successful, since Ranging Rook <b>will</b> try <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> off the bishops and bring the game into a full-scale battle. This can lead static rook into a difficult game, because their Boat castle is too weak compared to the opponent's Mino castle. As such, Static Rook would rather resort to making stronger castles, such as Anaguma or Left Mino.|$|R
500|$|The Yankees viewed Núñez as a {{possible}} replacement at shortstop for Jeter. Though they were <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> Jesús Montero, their top hitting prospect, the Yankees considered Núñez untouchable in trade negotiations. Scouts consider Núñez's throwing arm to be strong, and compliment his ability to hit for average, hit for power, and baserunning ability. However, scouts feel he can get [...] "lackadaisical in the field" [...] and swings at too many pitches outside of the strike zone.|$|E
500|$|The {{developers}} intended Ultima Underworld to be {{a realistic}} and interactive [...] "dungeon simulation", {{rather than a}} straightforward role-playing game. For example, many objects in the game have no actual use, while a lit torch may be used on corn to create popcorn. Weapons deteriorate with use, and the player character must eat and rest; light sources burn out unless extinguished before sleeping. A physics system allows, among other things, for items to bounce when thrown against surfaces. The game contains non-player characters (NPCs) with whom the player may interact by selecting dialogue choices from a menu. Most NPCs have possessions, and are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> them. The game was designed to give players [...] "a palette of strategies" [...] with which to approach situations, and its simulation systems allow for emergent gameplay.|$|E
500|$|The game {{received}} critical acclaim, {{according to}} Metacritic. The game was considered fun and satisfying by several reviewers. X-Play claimed {{that it was}} a [...] "pleasure to play", and praised its [...] "beautiful" [...] graphics and audio. The game satisfied IGN, which appreciated the lengthy minimum of 10 to 12 hours of playtime required to complete the game, further hailing it as an [...] "outstanding achievement on the Game Boy Advance". GamesRadar and GamePro, however, felt that the game was [...] "a little short", but still [...] "love every minute of it", finding the hidden secrets and new power-ups [...] "sublimely ingenious". The sentiment was shared with GameSpot, which was disappointed that the game ended so soon, but still stated, [...] "Metroid fans should absolutely get it, as should anyone <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> off some quantity for some serious quality in their gaming time." [...] Metroid Fusion received several accolades. It was named Handheld Game of the Year at the 2002 Interactive Achievement Awards. The game was also chosen as Best Game Boy Advance Adventure Game by IGN and Best Action Game on Game Boy Advance by GameSpot.|$|E

500|$|Thome {{missed a}} {{significant}} portion of the first half of the Phillies' 2005 season due to injury; he compiled only a [...]207 batting average with 7 home runs and 30 RBIs going into the All-Star break. He was only sporadically effective; one result was that Phillies fans booed him and cheered for replacement Ryan Howard instead. He had season-ending surgery on his right elbow in August, while Howard won the NL Rookie of the Year Award. The Phillies traded Thome and cash considerations to the Chicago White Sox on November 25, 2005, for outfielder Aaron Rowand and minor league pitching prospects Gio González and Daniel Haigwood. Though the emergence of Howard made Thome more expendable to the squad, another factor in his trade to the White Sox was his family situation – Thome's mother, the [...] "go-to lady" [...] in his family and his biggest fan, had died a year earlier, and he worried about his father. Since Philadelphia was <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> him, Thome waived the no-trade clause in his contract for the good of the team and requested that if possible, they trade him to Chicago so he could be with his father.|$|E
2500|$|Marginalism and neoclassical {{economics}} typically explain {{price formation}} broadly through {{the interaction of}} curves or schedules of supply and demand.

50|$|People <b>trading</b> stock <b>will</b> prefer <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> on {{the most}} popular {{exchange}} since this gives {{the largest number of}} potential counterparties (buyers for a seller, sellers for a buyer) and probably the best price. However, there have always been alternatives such as brokers trying to bring parties together <b>to</b> <b>trade</b> outside the exchange. Some third markets that were popular are Instinet, and later Island and Archipelago (the later two have since been acquired by Nasdaq and NYSE, respectively). One advantage is that this avoids the commissions of the exchange. However, it also has problems such as adverse selection. Financial regulators are probing dark pools.|$|R
40|$|Demand {{response}} is widely employed by today's data centers to reduce energy consumption {{in response to}} the increasing of electricity cost. To incentivize users of data centers participate in the demand response programs, i. e., breaking the "split incentive" hurdle, some prior researches propose market-based mechanisms such as dynamic pricing and static monetary rewards. However, these mechanisms are either intrusive or unfair. In this paper, we use time-varying rewards to incentivize users, who have flexible deadlines and are <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>trading</b> performance degradation for monetary rewards, grant time-shifting of their requests. With a game-theoretic framework, we model the game between a single data center and its users. Further, we extend our design via integrating it with two other emerging practical demand response strategies: server shutdown and local renewable energy generation. With real-world data traces, we show that a DC with our design can effectively shed its peak electricity load and overall electricity cost without reducing its profit, when comparing it with the current practice where no incentive mechanism is established...|$|R
