500|$|Lennon gave Mimi an {{allowance}} of £30 per week, {{but when she}} found out that his wife's mother was being given the same amount, she phoned the Lennons' house and said, [...] "What has she [...] done to deserve anything? Tell John, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> to him, that I am very, very annoyed", before slamming down the phone. Lennon moved to New York in 1971, and never returned to England again. Despite losing touch with several family members, he kept in close contact with her and telephoned her every week. On 5 December 1980, three days before Lennon was murdered, he called her to say he was homesick and was planning a trip back to England. After Lennon's death, Mimi was furious to find out that he had never transferred the ownership of the house over to her, which meant that Ono owned the house, and could sell it at any time.|$|E

2500|$|Professor Gerhard von Rad of Heidelberg University in the mid-20th-century {{argued that}} the Joseph {{narrative}} {{is closely related to}} earlier Egyptian wisdom writings. Von Rad likened Joseph's actions (for example in [...] ) to the admonition of Ptahhotep (an Egyptian vizier during the late 25th and early 24th centuries BCE): “If you are a tried counselor who sits in the hall of his lord, gather your wits together right well. [...] When you are silent, it will be better than tef-tef flowers. [...] <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>speak,</b> you must know how to bring the matter to a conclusion. [...] The one who gives counsel is an accomplished man; to speak is harder than any labor.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Many of Zinzendorf's {{beliefs and}} acts were based upon his father's words: “I live no more; {{he lives in}} me. I speak no more; he speaks in me. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> with me, you speak with him. When you have love for me, so too you have love for him, and when you hate me, so too you hate him, {{and when you have}} a word from me, so too you have it from him.” [...] Seeing Christ in Christian's eyes is a theme from the period in poetry, {{painting}} and engraving. An engraving complete with his portrait states that one can see the departed Christ by looking at Christel's forehead, meaning his eyes. A portrait of him now in the Moravian Archives in Herrnhut, Germany, includes the words Gebrochne Augen(broken eyes), again referring to seeing Christ at the moment of death in Christian's eyes, or at the moment of his completed sacrifice.|$|E
2500|$|By 1996, the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, then Lucienne Robillard, stated on the {{suggested}} alterations to the oath: [...] "This {{is a difficult}} decision to make, because I realise that <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>speak</b> about changing the oath, people {{think you want to}} change all the monarchy system. We don't want a discussion like that in Canada right now." [...] According to an Angus Reid Strategies survey for Citizenship and Immigration Canada, conducted in January 1996, 51% of respondents felt that a new oath of allegiance should remove any reference to the Queen, and 38% felt that allegiance should be pledged to both Canada and its sovereign. Only 5% favoured swearing allegiance only to the monarch; though, at the same time, only 5% of Canadians were aware the Queen was their head of state. Meanwhile, press reaction to the continued proposals for alternate oaths was muted. The Globe and Mail editorial of 12 December 1998 stated: [...] "The language is being drained dry, killed by a thousand smiley-faced cuts," [...] while the Ottawa Citizen was more critical on 11 December: [...] "The new citizenship oath... leaves us cold... It would strengthen the political argument for abolishing the monarchy on the death of Queen Elizabeth; and it would test monarchist support by seeing how many Canadians even notice or holler. We noticed. Consider this a holler." ...|$|E
