Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction. Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists.|$|E
5|$|Fishers {{have five}} toes on each foot, with unsheathed, {{retractable}} claws. Their feet are disproportionately large for their legs, {{making it easier}} for them to move on top of snow packs. In addition to the toes, there are four central pads on each foot. On the hind paws there are coarse hairs that grow between the pads and the toes, giving them added traction when walking on a variety of surfaces. Fishers have highly mobile ankle joints that can rotate their hind paws almost 180 degrees, allowing them to maneuver well in trees and climb down head-first. The fisher is one of relatively few mammalian species <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> descend trees head-first.|$|E

5|$|In low-duty cycle echolocation, bats can {{separate}} their calls and returning echoes by time. They have to time their short calls to finish before echoes return. This {{is important because}} these bats contract their middle ear muscles when emitting a call, so they can avoid deafening themselves. The time interval between the call and echo allows them to relax these muscles, so they can clearly hear the returning echo. The delay of the returning echoes provides the bat <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> estimate the range to their prey.|$|E

5|$|In the post-Second World War period, the Soviet Union began {{developing}} a capable fleet of long-range bombers <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> deliver nuclear weapons across North America and Europe. The main threat was principally from high-speed, high-altitude bombing runs launched from the Soviet Union travelling over the Arctic against military bases and built-up industrial centres in Canada and the United States.

5|$|Joshua Humphreys' {{design was}} {{unusual for the}} time, being long on keel and narrow of beam (width) and {{mounting}} very heavy guns. The design called for a diagonal scantling (rib) scheme intended to restrict hogging while giving the ships extremely heavy planking. This design gave the hull a greater strength than a more lightly built frigate. Humphreys' design was based on his realization that the fledgling United States of the period could not match the European states {{in the size of}} their navies. This being so, the frigates were designed to overpower other frigates <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> escape from a ship of the line.|$|E
5|$|Lee {{remained}} in New York City until March, when the Continental Congress {{sent him to}} South Carolina; the defenses' construction was left to General William Alexander (Lord Stirling). Troops were in limited supply, so Washington found the defenses incomplete, but Lee had concluded {{that it would be}} impossible to hold the city with the British commanding the sea. He reasoned that the defenses should be located <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> inflict heavy casualties upon the British if any move was made to take and hold ground. Barricades and redoubts were established in and around the city, and the bastion of Fort Stirling across the East River in Brooklyn Heights, facing the city. Lee also saw that the immediate area was cleared of Loyalists.|$|E

From theoretical side, the paper analyzes the effect on the spin transition by a time dependent longitudinal field.
