5|$|The {{principal}} damage {{sustained by}} aircraft flying into a {{volcanic ash cloud}} is abrasion to forward-facing surfaces, such as the windshield and leading edges of the wings, and accumulation of ash into surface openings, including engines. Abrasion of <b>windshields</b> and landing lights will reduce visibility forcing pilots to rely on their instruments. However, some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors (e.g., pitot tubes) can become blocked with ash. Ingestion of ash into engines causes abrasion damage to compressor fan blades. The ash erodes sharp blades in the compressor, reducing its efficiency. The ash melts in the combustion chamber to form molten glass. The ash then solidifies on turbine blades, blocking air flow and causing the engine to stall.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of most ash {{is such that}} its melting temperature is within the operating temperature (>1000 °C) of modern large jet engines. The degree of impact depends upon the concentration of ash in the plume, {{the length of time}} the aircraft spends within the plume and the actions taken by the pilots. Critically, melting of ash, particularly volcanic glass, can result in accumulation of resolidified ash on turbine nozzle guide vanes, resulting in compressor stall and complete loss of engine thrust. The standard procedure of the engine control system when it detects a possible stall is to increase power which would exacerbate the problem. It is recommended that pilots reduce engine power and quickly exit the cloud by performing a descending 180° turn. Volcanic gases, which are present within ash clouds, can also cause damage to engines and acrylic <b>windshields,</b> although this damage may not surface for many years.|$|E

40|$|Both {{experiment}} and numerical simulation of bird impact on aircraft <b>windshield</b> was studied. The {{finite element model}} of bird impact on the <b>windshield</b> was established to predict the damage initiation and propagation of the <b>windshield</b> after bird impact via the nonlinear finite element method, combined with the user-defined materials subroutine (VUMAT) of the ABAQUS/Explicit software. In the model, an elastic-plastic and a nonlinear viscoelasticity constitutive model were adopted to define the material constitutive response of bird and <b>windshield,</b> respectively. The shear failure criteria and the tensile failure were selected to identify the damage of bird and <b>windshield,</b> respectively. The corresponding elements will be removed when the materials meet the above failure criteria. The supporting structure of the <b>windshield</b> glass was modeled with skins and rubber gaskets herein instead of modeled with the boundary condition directly. The analysis results include the instantaneous deformation of bird and <b>windshield,</b> the damage modes of the <b>windshield,</b> displacement curves and strain curves of the measured points on the <b>windshield,</b> which agree well with the experimental results.
