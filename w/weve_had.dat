5000|$|Chambers, close colleagues, {{and many}} staff members {{as of the}} 1930s helped elevate TIME-"interstitial intellectuals," [...] as {{historian}} Robert Vanderlan has called them. [...] Colleague John Hersey described them as follows: [...] Time was in an interesting phase; an editor named Tom Matthews had gathered a brilliant group of writers, including James Agee, Robert Fitzgerald, Whittaker Chambers, Robert Cantwell, Louis Kronenberger, and Calvin Fixx... They were dazzling. Time’s style was still very hokey—“backward ran sentences till reeled the mind”—but I could tell, even as a neophyte, who had written each of the pieces in the magazine, because each of these writers had such a distinctive voice. [...] By early 1948, Chambers {{had become one of}} the best known writer-editors at Time. First had come his scathing commentary [...] "The Ghosts on the Roof" [...] (March 5, 1945) on the Yalta Conference (in which Hiss partook). Subsequent cover-story essays profiled Marian Anderson, Arnold J. Toynbee, Rebecca West and Reinhold Niebuhr. The cover story on Marian Anderson (December 30, 1946) proved so popular that the magazine broke its rule of non-attribution in response to readers letters: [...] Most Time cover stories are written and edited by the regular staffs of the section in which they appear. Certain cover stories, that present special difficulties or call for a special literary skill, are written by Senior Editor Whittaker Chambers." [...] In a 1945 letter to Time colleague Charles Wertenbaker, Time-Life deputy editorial director John Shaw Billings said of Chambers, [...] "Whit puts on the best show in words of any writer <b>weve</b> ever <b>had...</b> a superb technician, particularly skilled in the mosaic art of putting a Time section together."

40|$|Today, cross-device {{capabilities}} {{has become}} the de facto standard among most applications, enabling users to access an application, and in some cases, resume their previous session, from a various of devices. While this allows the user to run the same application on different devices, there still exists no widespread solution providing the ability to transfer an ongoing application session from one device to another, continuing the ongoing session immediately. As users <b>we?ve</b> asked <b>have</b> considered such functionality to be of potential great value, this is definitely something worth exploring. In this thesis, we have investigated and proved that a generic, cross-device session mobility platform is possible and feasible, but not without {{a certain level of}} application modification, which we believe is a reasonable requirement. A truly generic cross-device session mobility platform should work with any application, irrespective of the type of the application and the type of terminal it is running on. This becomes a challenge, considering that the nature of an application may vary a lot from application to application. Our proposed solution, the Migration Platform (MP), is realized as a centralized peer-to-peer architecture. It consists of two entities; the Migration Server (MS) and the Migration Client (MC), the latter installed as a software on each device. Together, the MS and MC will provide any application with cross-device session mobility capabilities. Upon switching device (i. e. upon a migration), a direct data channel between source and target device is established. The state of the application about to be migrated is transferred over this data channel, and passed to the application on the target device. This enables the application to resume the application session from where it was left off on the source device. By suggesting a workaround, we also make this scheme viable for real-time communication applications. The applications that are to utilize the capabilities provided by the MP need to implement an interface to the MC, as well as a user interface enabling the user to trigger migration functions from the application. This way, the application can invoke migration functions provided by the MC, and the MC can invoke the application-specific functions specified in the interface. By having the application developers implement the required functions, we provide them with complete freedom when it comes to how they want to apply the migration functionalities, both when it comes to behavior and appearance. We implemented a proof of concept in the web environment, primarily based on the bleeding edge technology, WebRTC, an API currently being drafted, enabling browser to browser communication. Using the exact same generic scripts, we implement session mobility features in four, arguably different, demo applications; a HTML 5 video streaming application, a YouTube streaming application, a videochat application and a Chrome browsing extension. With this, we showcased the behavior of the session mobility features, as well as proved the viability of our proposed solution. </p...|$|R

The deck had been broken open, so that one could look down into the ship. From beam to beam the deck was buckled, but the ship held together. Another sixty Junkers 87 Stuka dive bombers attacked the convoy, focusing on Ohio. A series of near misses ensued as the tanker approached the island of Pantelleria. Bombs threw spray over the decks of the tanker, while aircraft used their machine guns. One near-miss buckled the ships plates and the forward tank filled with water. The 3-inch (76 mm) gun at the bows was twisted in its mountings and put out of action. A formation of five Junkers 88s was broken up by the tankers anti aircraft guns, with the bombs falling harmlessly into the sea. Another plane, this time a Junkers 87, was shot down by an Ohio gunner; however, the aircraft crashed into Ohios starboard side, forward of the upper bridge, and exploded.

40|$|A {{new model}} for land use {{planning}} Cue: Africa is well known as a continent rich in natural resources. However, if those resources are to bring prosperity and development, how they are used and managed is clearly critical. But who {{has the right to}} decide how the resources should be used? Local communities? Town councils? Government ministries or planning departments? An obvious answer is that it depends on who owns the land, but in many areas ownership is disputed. In much of rural South Africa, as elsewhere, two different systems of land ownership exist side-by-side, the formal system based on legal documents, and traditional systems rooted in local culture. Not surprisingly, reaching agreements on how land should be used in this context can be extremely difficult, and may lead to open conflict. According to Pat Luckin, a land use planner working in South Africa, preventing conflict and developing agreement over land use depends on involving local communities in planning, and creating better communication between the communities and other interest groups. In recent work with two communities, Pat has experimented with a new approach which she believes has greatly improved that communication process, and has given people a much better understanding of the resources that they have. She spoke to Susanna Thorp about the new approach and the way it has been used. IN:		?I {{think the most important thing}} ? OUT:		? reduction of conflict in certain areas. ? DUR?N		 3 ? 38 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Pat Luckin, on some new approaches to {{land use planning}} that have recently been piloted in South Africa. Transcript Luckin	I think the most important thing to realise when one deals with planning processes is trust, and that people participate in the planning process. Now that?s quite difficult with the formal planning tools that we have which are quite abstract and often come from other countries and sometimes aren?t applicable to our local conditions. So what we?ve done is we built three-dimensional models, physical models, so people can physically see the land and touch a model. Immediately people then identify where they live, where their schools are, where the rivers are, where the hills are, where the forests are etc. Thorp	So how has that made a difference in the way that people have worked together and if they have identified these things, how have they then used those results? Luckin	What we have done in our communities is we have brought people together, traditional leaders, women, other community members, people with disabilities, to make sure that we have a good range of people living in that particular area and ensure that they can participate on how land in that particular area should be used. Obviously one does this in an area where people are demanding a change in land use or more appropriate land use or where there are some conflicts in land use and people need to resolve these problems. So bring all the different parties together around the model and they just start discussing how they want to use different pieces of land. Thorp	Now you mentioned that there had previously been a lot of conflict. Has this process allowed some of those conflicts to be resolved, can you give me examples? Luckin	Often when one has large areas of land, like particularly in South Africa, there is often distrust or lack of communication between different sectors of communities, between traditional leaders and municipalities, and what these particular projects have facilitated is that by bringing the people together around the model, <b>we?ve</b> <b>had</b> municipal officials, <b>we?ve</b> <b>had</b> traditional leaders, <b>we?ve</b> <b>had</b> elders and women all talking around the same issues and agreeing and understanding one another. And I think that the modeling process has huge potential for helping people to genuinely communicate with one another and realise that they are much closer to one another than they had thought before, and that they all have the same intention which is the management of land and the development of a particular area concerned. Thorp	So a very powerful tool obviously, but you?ve only used it in two communities? Luckin		Very small, yes. Thorp	How would you take this process on now? Are there lessons that you have learned that you would perhaps do differently or is this something that you would like to try elsewhere? Luckin	Oh yes well the responsibility of using models in a community are very huge. So as I said earlier they must be based on trust. There is certain information in communities relating to biodiversity, relating to plants and animals which have specific significance to communities which they might not want to divulge and they have the right to keep that information private and within the community and not make it public, particularly relating to medicinal plants where people invariably get exploited. Next time I go into a community we would write up protocols of how the information would be managed, who would own the information, how much of it would become mapped in a public map for public consumption and how much of it would be kept within the community. It does not solve all problems there are obviously lots of other land legal problems which require other kinds of solutions but it definitely can facilitate the reduction of conflict in certain areas.

SECTION II To explain, or not to explain: that is the question; Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer The slings and arrows of outrageous misinterpretation, Or to take arms against a sea of the uneducated, And by explaining end them.

To write, to explain, To explain: perchance to understand: Ay, there???s the rub; For in o???erwaxing our ideas what reinterpretations my come, When we have shuffles off this mortal coil, Must give us a pause: there???s the fear That makes short any long thesis; For who would bear the whips of scorns of this peers, The typist???s errors, the thesis advisor???s contumely.

Thus self-protection does make authors of us all, And thus the native hue of rebellion Is sickles o???er with the obligation to explain, And artworks of great pitch and moment With this regard their intent turn awry And lose the name oblique...|$|E
