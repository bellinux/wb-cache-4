40|$|Abstract- Paper <b>cups</b> <b>waste</b> {{represents}} a valuable source of energy. Therefore, it is studied {{to determine the}} quantity of energy obtained from waste of known amount and composition. For a waste to become an energy system, the kinetic parameter of waste {{is one of the}} important characteristics that determine the energy obtainable from wastes. TGA has frequently been employed in the kinetic study of the thermal degradation of cellulosic materials. In this work, we have studied the thermo gravimetric analysis of paper <b>cup</b> <b>waste</b> at 25 °C/min, 30 °C/min in the air and 30 °C/min in the nitrogen atmosphere and determine the activation energy by using thermogravimetric curves. The Activation energy increases from 17 KJ/mol to 28 KJ/mol with increasing heating rate from 25 °C/min to 30 °C/min in the air atmosphere. Activation energy is less 22 KJ/mol in nitrogen atmosphere as compared to 28 KJ/mol in air atmosphere at a heating rate of 30 °C/min.

50|$|Big {{events such}} as Musilac often {{end up with a}} large amount of garbage such as plastic cups {{covering}} the area, bottles, etc. The festival has thus created two projects allowing them to be ecological friendly. To avoid <b>waste</b> of <b>cups,</b> they are given to spectators with a one euro caution fee, that will be then given back when it is returned. By being partners with Ecocup, the festival then recycles all the cups giving them a second life as beach ash trays or even car accessories. Musilac also offers a recycling garden put in place with their partner Coca-Cola, where in exchange of plastic bottles they offer gifts created from bottle recycling, and then reuse the plastic to create garden furniture for Musilac.|$|R
50|$|Under a new {{environmental}} program, between August 29 and December 11, 2008, the cafeteria collected {{an average of}} 243 pounds of compostables a day. Besides food waste, this includes biodegradable paper <b>waste,</b> like <b>cups,</b> soup bowls, compostable lids, napkins and paper towels. It also includes to-go containers, cup lids, and straws and portion cups made from sugar-based polylactic acid plastic. The composting program took about 27,216 pounds of materials out of the waste stream in Thurston County in the fall semester alone. This material was transported to the Silver Springs composting facility and will be used again in many different forms. Saint Martin's is also setting up a program with Standard Biodiesel to start picking up used cooking oil and rendered grease for use in biodiesel.|$|R
40|$|Biomass {{has been}} {{identified}} as an ideal resource for partly substituting the fossil fuels. Cellulosic biomass including paper, wood, fibrous plant materials etc., being abundant and low in cost, offers a potential solution for bio-fuels production. <b>Waste</b> paper <b>cups</b> (cellulosic feedstock) are piling up very rapidly on earth’s surface and urgently needs attention. Pyrolysis is one of the latest technologies which have the potential to provide valuable liquid and gaseous fuels from these biomass sources. Hence pyrolysis of paper cups is done and the bio oil and solid char were analyzed. Physical and Chemical analysis was done for the pyrolytic oil.

40|$|Abstract In this work, {{we studied}} the {{addition}} of sulfonated polystyrene produced from <b>waste</b> plastic <b>cups</b> as an admixture for mortars. Mortars were analyzed with polystyrene content of 0. 0; 0. 2; 0. 6; 1. 0 and 1. 4 % {{in relation to the}} cement mass. The influence of polystyrene on the mortars' properties was evaluated by the consistency index, water retention, water absorption, porosity, elasticity modulus, compressive strength, flexural strength, bond tensile strength and microscopy. The increase in the sulfonated polystyrene content decreased the elasticity modulus of the mortar and, despite higher porosity, there was a reduction of water absorption by capillarity. In relation to mortar without admixture, the modified mortar showed an increase in water retention and consistency index, and a large increase in flexural strength and bond tensile strength. The significant increase of bond tensile strength (214 % with admixture 1 %) highlights the potential of the produced material as an adhesive mortar...|$|R
