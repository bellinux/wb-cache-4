50|$|The Discovery 5 is {{the first}} Discovery to be built on a unibody chassis, unlike its {{predecessors}} which were built body on frame. This allows the vehicle to have higher torsional rigidity with less weight. According to the automotive press, the latest generation has a higher <b>wading</b> <b>depth</b> (up to 35.6”), improved ground clearance and a more comfortable ride while traversing adverse terrain.|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 106 juveniles ranging from 8. 5 to 46. 0 mm SL of striped jewfish Stereolepis doederleini were {{collected}} along a beach of Nagasaki Prefecture. The juveniles occurred from April to June with {{the peak of}} occurrence in April or May. Within <b>wading</b> <b>depths</b> they were caught exclusively from the bottom layer. We often found and collected them with a small scoop net along the beach line, 10 to 50 cm deep, at low tide. The juveniles were sporadically distributed among small pieces of seaweeds and terrestrial plants scattered drifting on the sea bottom. Usually their movement was very slow, often swimming quietly in a small circle with their tail bending to form L-shape. A juvenile 10. 4 mm SL had 22 rings on lapillus, and a juvenile 30. 5 mm SL had 61 rings. Within this range, standard length (y, mm) of the fish related {{to the number of}} rings (x) of lapilli as y= 33. 99 /(1 +e². ¹³⁻⁰. ⁰x). The main food item of the fish up to 20 mm SL was Copepoda, and changed to Mysidacea thereafter, while fishes also became to consist a significant part of stomach contents of the fish. They began to disappear from the beach when they reached about 30 mm SL and five vertical stripes appeared on the side...|$|R

40|$|This article {{covers the}} biology {{and the history}} of the bay scallop {{habitats}} and fishery from Massachusetts to North Carolina. The scallop species that ranges from Massachusetts to New York is Argopecten irradians irradians. In New Jersey, this species grades into A. i. concentricus, which then ranges from Maryland though North Carolina. Bay scallops inhabit broad, shallow bays usually containing eelgrass meadows, an important component in their habitat. Eelgrass appears to be a factor in the production of scallop larvae and also the protection of juveniles, especially, from predation. Bay scallops spawn during the warm months and live for 18 – 30 months. Only two generations of scallops are present at any time. The abundances of each vary widely among bays and years. Scallops were harvested along with other mollusks on a small scale by Native Americans. During most of the 1800 ’s, people of European descent gathered them at <b>wading</b> <b>depths</b> or from beaches where storms had washed them ashore. Scallop shells were also and continue to be commonly used in ornaments. Some fishing for bay scallops began in the 1850 ’s and 1860 ’s, when the A-frame dredge became available and markets were being developed for the large, white, tasty scallop adductor muscles, and by the 1870 ’s commercial-scale fishing was underway. This has always been a cold-season fishery: scallops achieve full size by late fall, and the eyes or hearts (adductor muscles) remain preserved in the cold weather while enroute by trains and trucks to city markets. The first boats used were sailing catboats and sloops in New England and New York. To a lesser extent, scallops probably were also harvested by using push nets, picking them up with scoop nets, and anchor-roading. In the 1910 ’s and 1920 ’s, the sails on catboats were replaced with gasoline engines. By the mid 1940 ’s, outboard motors became more available and with them the numbers of fishermen increased. The increases consisted of parttimers who took leaves of 2 – 4 weeks from their regular jobs to earn extra money. In the years when scallops were abundant on local beds, the fishery employed as many as 10 – 50...|$|R
5000|$|Other protests {{were that}} the project would remove {{citizens}} from the natural wetland vegetation of the river systems and their traditional recreational usage, by deepening the rivers to beyond safe <b>wading</b> <b>depth</b> and replacing native river flora with garden flowers and oak trees. Thus, this [...] "Disneyfication" [...] of the rivers meant less unplanned recreation and more reliance on business-oriented recreation, such as cruise boats.|$|E
50|$|Off-road {{performance}} remains broadly {{similar to}} the Freelander 2 model, ground clearance is 212 mm, {{the same as the}} Freelander 2 and <b>wading</b> <b>depth</b> is 600 mm, an improvement of 100 mm. The approach angle for the Discovery Sport is 25° and the ramp angle is 21°, reductions of 6° and 2° respectively, when compared to the Freelander 2. The departure angle remains unchanged at 31°. The Discovery Sport features removable components on the lower sections of the front bumper which improves the approach angle.|$|E
50|$|KSUS {{project was}} in two variants, {{assuming}} {{the usage of}} 75mm anti-aircraft gun and 35 mm armor. There were also two turrets {{at the front of}} the vehicle equipped with heavy machine guns and one heavy machine gun in the main turret. Weight of the tank was 22 tonnes. The drive consisted of two petrol engines of 300 hp each. The ability to cross the ditches reached 2.5 meters, <b>wading</b> <b>depth</b> reached up to 1.2 m. The tank would have a length of 7.3 m, width 2.6 m, height 2.8 m Assumed speed of travel on the road was 45 km/h. The crew was six people.|$|E
60|$|More {{lanterns}} were procured, and {{the river}} examined; and then, at last, on the opposite shore, which was open to the fields, some little boot-tracks were discerned in the mud, which left {{no doubt that the}} too excitable girl had <b>waded</b> through a <b>depth</b> of water reaching nearly to her shoulders--for this was the chief river of the county, and was mentioned in all the geography books with respect. As Sue had not brought disgrace upon the school by drowning herself, the matron began to speak superciliously of her, and to express gladness that she was gone.|$|R
50|$|The {{braking system}} was by Girling {{and was a}} simple {{single-line}} hydraulic layout without power assistance. The engine, fuel system and all electrical items were waterproofed so the vehicle could <b>wade</b> to a <b>depth</b> of 6 ft with minimal preparation; a snorkel attached to the air cleaner and normally carried horizontally on the right wing (US = fender) could be raised during wading operations. Maintaining this level of capability {{was found to be}} expensive and of limited value, and the policy of CT vehicles was abandoned in 1956 and the CT family were downgraded to General Service (GS) status.|$|R
60|$|He {{returned}} {{to the beach and}} clambered about over the rocky backbone, again hunting for me with lighted matches. The closeness of the shave impelled me to further flight. Not daring to wade upright, on account of the noise made by floundering and by the suck of the mud, I remained lying down in the mud and propelled myself over its surface by means of my hands. Still keeping the trail made by the Chinese in going from and to the junk, I held on until I reached the water. Into this I <b>waded</b> to a <b>depth</b> of three feet, and then I turned off to the side on a line parallel with the beach.|$|R
40|$|Fish larvae and juveniles were {{collected}} {{in the waters of}} <b>wading</b> <b>depth</b> along sandy beaches of western Japan with a 0. 7 -mm-mesh, 1. 3 - by 5 -m seine. Presence of Chanos chanos, Salangichthys microdon, Plecoglossus altivelis, Allanetta bleekeri, Gerres oyena, Sparus sarba, Acanthopagrus schlegeli, A. latus, and Lateolabrax latus and absence of Engraulis japonica, Gonorhynchus abbreviatus, Upeneus bensasi, and Macrorhamphosus scolopax distinguished the larval ichthyofauna of surf zones from those in other known biotopes of fish nursery. The surfichthyofauna was usually more diverse in spring and summer than in autumn and winter. Monthly total catches of individuals fluctuated greatly according to the abundances of a few influential species such as Clupanodon punctatus in spring and Plecoglossus altivelis in autumn to winter. Most larval fishes seemed to inhabit surf zones only during daytime. An influence of tidal phases on occurrence of larval fishes was not apparent. Categories of pelagic and demersal components were suggested for surf zone ichthyofauna...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{study the}} {{characteristics}} and mechanism of mine blast injury that wading in shoal of different depths through an animal model. Methods Ninety-six healthy adult New Zealand white rabbits weighing 2. 19 ± 0. 12 kg were randomly divided into land group (n= 16), limb wading group (n= 16, the water depth reaching {{up the middle}} of the thighs of rabbits), and chest wading group (n= 16, the water depth reaching up the thoracic xiphoid), stress test group (n= 30), fake injury group (n= 18). Punctiform burster was used to simulate landmine. Electric ignited the simulated mine away, causing landmine explosion injury to rabbits' one-sided hind limbs in upright state. High-speed photography was used to observe the movement of water accompanying the simulated mine explosion. Arterial blood serum markers of myocardial injury (CK-MB, cTnI) and nerve injury (MBP, NSE) were detected before injury, and 3, 6 and 12 h after injury, and echocardiography, electrocardiography, CT, DSA and other examinations were implemented at the same time. Survival animals were killed 12 h after injury for anatomy to record their injuries to the limbs and distant organs. The histopathological examination was done to define the injury characteristics further. Results Feet and distal tibia were broken, and closed femoral fractures and arterial damage were often found away from the stump in limb wading group. This type of injury was different from the mop-like tearing tissue in the land group. Chest, abdominal organs and the brain, spinal cord injury in wading group were more severe than those in land group. There were higher incidences of chest, abdominal organs and spinal cord injury in chest wading Group. Conclusion The energy transfer of underwater explosion is affected by water depth and limbs or trunk mutually, which is an important mechanism of the complex and serious injuries in the wading group. The <b>wading</b> <b>depth</b> is an important factor affecting severity of the injury. Based on characteristics and unique mechanism of wading explosion, emergency treatment and the principle of early treatment for injury warrant further explored.

5000|$|King's Quest is {{the first}} {{adventure}} game to integrate graphical animation into the player's view of game world. Because of this, King's Quest shifted the focus away from the static scenery, to the player's character, which was now animated on-screen. There are animation sequences for most player-world interactions reachable through {{the normal course of}} exploration. For example, there were different animation sequences showing Graham picking up objects from the ground, opening doors, and <b>wading</b> through water. <b>Depth</b> perspective was simulated as well; Graham could walk behind objects, causing his character to be 'hidden' from view, or walk in front of them, obscuring the object. This attention to graphical animation, while commonplace in action games, earned King's Quest the distinction as the first [...] "3D-animated" [...] adventure game.|$|R
40|$|Studies {{measuring}} the energy costs of wading in water {{have been limited}} to higher walking speeds in straight lines, in deep water. However, much foraging in water, by both humans and other primates, is conducted in the shallows and at low speeds of locomotion that include elements of turning, as befits searching for cryptic or hidden foods within a patch. The present study brings together data on the rate of oxygen consumption during wading by humans from previous studies, and augments these with new data for <b>wading</b> in shallower <b>depths,</b> with slower and more tortuous walking, to obtain a better understanding both of the absolute costs of wading in typical scenarios of aquatic foraging and of how the cost of wading varies {{as a function of}} water depth and speed of locomotion. Previous and present data indicate that, at low speeds, wading has a similar energetic cost to walking on land, particularly at lower water depths, and only at higher speeds is the cost of wading noticeably more expensive than when water is absent. This is probably explained by the relatively small volume of water that must be displaced during locomotion in shallow waters coupled with the compensating support to the limbs that the water affords. The support to the limbs/body provided by water is discussed further, in the context of bipedal locomotion by non-human primates during wading...|$|R
