5|$|Anti-Earp {{writers and}} {{researchers}} use Frank Waters' Earp Brothers of Tombstone, {{as their primary}} source for material that presents Wyatt Earp {{as something of a}} villainous monster, aided and abetted by his brothers who were almost brutes. Waters detested the Earps so badly that he presented a book that <b>was</b> <b>terribly</b> flawed, poorly edited, and brimming with prevarications. In his other work, Waters is poetic. In the Earp Brothers of Tombstone, he {{is little more than a}} tabloid hack, trying to slander someone he dislikes. To date, no reason has been uncovered for the bias Frank Waters exhibited against Wyatt Earp and his brothers.|$|E
5|$|Wheelbarrow: The {{earliest}} wheelbarrows with {{archaeological evidence}} {{in the form of}} a one-wheel cart come from 2nd century Han Dynasty Emperor Hui's tomb murals and brick tomb reliefs. The painted tomb mural of a man pushing a wheelbarrow was found in a tomb at Chengdu, Sichuan province, dated precisely to 118 CE. The stone carved relief of a man pushing a wheelbarrow was found in the tomb of Shen Fujun in Sichuan province, dated circa 150 CE. And then there is the story of the pious Dong Yuan pushing his father around in a single-wheel lu che barrow, depicted in a mural of the Wu Liang tomb-shrine of Shandong (dated to 147 CE). However, there are even earlier accounts than this that date back to the 1st century BCE and 1st century CE. The 5th century Book of Later Han stated that the wife of the once poor and youthful imperial censor Bao Xuan helped him push a lu che back to his village during their feeble wedding ceremony, around 30 BCE. Later, during the Red Eyebrows Rebellion (c. 20 CE) against Xin dynasty's Wang Mang (45 BCE23 CE), the official Zhao Xi saved his wife from danger by disguising himself and pushing her along in his lu che barrow, past a group of brigand rebels who questioned him, and allowed him to pass after he convinced them that his wife <b>was</b> <b>terribly</b> ill.|$|E
25|$|As long as Cervera {{remained}} within Santiago Harbor, his fleet {{was relatively}} safe. The guns {{of the city}} were quite sufficient {{to make up for}} his fleet's deficiencies, and the area was well defended with sea mines, torpedoes and other obstructions. Nevertheless, Cervera <b>was</b> <b>terribly</b> outmatched. Though his ships were modern, they were too few, and their technical problems compounded his worries. The lack of refitting facilities in Santiago to assist with the repairs of the vessels in Cervera's squadron made the situation all the more desperate.|$|E

Except for one thing: First and foremost, we must have a new schoolbuilding. Mr. Mott says they <b>are</b> <b>terribly</b> cramped." ...|$|R
25|$|It {{was never}} a success financially. In fact, we lost money, if I {{remember}} correctly, on every single release bar one. I did quite like it but it <b>was</b> <b>terribly</b> indulgent. Not as indulgent {{as it would have}} been had I not had a business partner, admittedly... I liked having a label. It enabled you to put out stuff that you liked without, in those days, having to worry about whether it was going to work commercially. I've never been a good business man.|$|E
25|$|On January 17, 2009, Steve Spagnuolo {{was named}} the new {{head coach of the}} franchise. In his {{previous}} post as Defensive Coordinator with the New York Giants, Spagnuolo masterminded a defensive scheme that shut down the potent offense of the previously undefeated and untied New England Patriots, the odds on favorite to win the Super Bowl that year. In one of the greatest upsets in Super Bowl history, the New York Giants defeated the Patriots 17–14. In spite of his success as Defensive Coordinator with the New York Giants, Spagnuolo's first season as Head Coach of the Rams <b>was</b> <b>terribly</b> disappointing as the team won only once in 16 attempts.|$|E
25|$|According to Pasternak, {{during the}} 1937 show trial of General Iona Yakir and Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, the Union of Soviet Writers {{requested}} all members to add {{their names to}} a statement supporting {{the death penalty for}} the defendants. They demanded Pasternak's signature as well, but he refused to give it. Vladimir Stavski, the chairman of the Union, was terrified that he would be punished for Pasternak's dissent. The leadership of the Union travelled to Pasternak's dacha at Peredelkino and severely threatened the writer, who refused to sign the statement and returned to his dacha. Hearing this, Zinaida Pasternak, who was pregnant, <b>was</b> <b>terribly</b> upset, accusing him of risking the destruction of their family. Pasternak went to bed. He and Zinaida expected to be arrested that evening. They later learned that an NKVD agent was hiding in the bushes outside their window and wrote down every word they said to each other.|$|E

25|$|Necker {{was viewed}} as the savior of France {{by many as the}} country stood on the brink of ruin, but his actions could not stop the French Revolution. Necker put a stop to the {{rebellion}} in the Dauphiné by legalizing the Assembly of Vizille, and then set to work to arrange for the summons of the Estates-General of 1789. He advocated doubling the representation of the Third Estate to satisfy the people. But he failed to address the matter of voting – rather than voting by head count, which is what the people wanted, voting remained as one vote for each estate. Also, his address at the Estates-General <b>was</b> <b>terribly</b> miscalculated: it lasted for hours, and while those present expected a reforming policy to save the nation, he gave them financial data. This approach had serious repercussions on Necker's reputation; he appeared to consider the Estates-General to be a facility designed to help the administration rather than to reform government.|$|E

500|$|A year later, {{while working}} with Tin Machine on their second album, he mused on his {{previous}} few albums: [...] "You can tell I <b>was</b> <b>terribly</b> unhappy {{in the late}} '80s. ... I was in that netherworld of commercial acceptance. It was an awful trip. 1983, '84, '85, '86, '87 - those five years were simply dreadful. ... Never Let Me Down had good songs that I mistreated. I didn't really apply myself. I wasn't quite sure what I {{was supposed to be}} doing. I wish there had been someone around who could have told me." ...|$|E
500|$|Elections {{director}} Alexander Payne {{was eager}} to cast Witherspoon as Tracy, based on her performances in Freeway and the 1991 film The Man in the Moon, and Witherspoon was equally eager {{to sign on to}} the project—but not to play Tracy. Witherspoon was drawn to the part of Tammy Metzler, the cynical outcast who becomes the election's dark horse presidential candidate. Referring to the scene in which Tammy delivers a shocking campaign speech denouncing the school's administration and the entire concept of elected student government, Witherspoon said, [...] "That speech alone made me want to play Tammy! So I <b>was</b> <b>terribly</b> conflicted." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{angelshark}} {{is generally}} not aggressive towards humans, though it can deliver a severe bite if disturbed. When approached underwater, the angelshark usually remains still or swims away, though one circling a diver with its mouth open is recorded. Fishery workers in particular should treat it with caution; in the 1776 edition of British Zoology, Thomas Pennant wrote that it is [...] "extremely fierce and dangerous to be approached. We know of an instance of a fisherman, whose leg <b>was</b> <b>terribly</b> torn by a large one of this species, which lay within his nets in shallow water, and which he went to lay hold of incautiously." ...|$|E

500|$|Game Show Network (GSN) {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} air Press Your Luck in September 2001, and high viewership ratings prompted the network to order {{a revival of the}} series. Two pilots were taped on February 13, 2002: one with original Press Your Luck host Peter Tomarken and the other hosted by Todd Newton. Newton was ultimately chosen to host the show. Tomarken explained that he was asked to change his style of hosting, saying, [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>terribly</b> hurtful and I think I was doomed before I did [...] I remember being told, 'No, no. Be nice. Be sure everybody likes you.' I took that advice with the pilot. I made the same mistake." [...] Tomarken also acknowledged that GSN wanted to employ a younger host in an effort to attract a younger audience.|$|E
500|$|Shaw's {{enthusiasm for}} the Soviet Union dated to the early 1920s when he had hailed Lenin as [...] "the one really {{interesting}} statesman in Europe". Having turned down several chances to visit, in 1931 he joined a party led by Nancy Astor. The carefully managed trip culminated in a lengthy meeting with Stalin, whom Shaw later described as [...] "a Georgian gentleman" [...] with no malice in him. At a dinner given in his honour, Shaw told the gathering: [...] "I have seen all the 'terrors' and I <b>was</b> <b>terribly</b> pleased by them". In March 1933 Shaw was a co-signatory to a letter in The Manchester Guardian protesting at the continuing misrepresentation of Soviet achievements: [...] "No lie is too fantastic, no slander is too stale... for employment by the more reckless elements of the British press." ...|$|E
500|$|Historian Alex von Tunzelmann {{gave the}} film a mixed review in The Guardian: [...] "The Girl {{is perhaps a}} more {{effective}} piece of film-making than Hitchcock, though it is also more questionable in its portrayal of the directorhe film depicts [...] accurately, though Jones's Hitchcock {{appears to be more}} gratified by the spectacle than the real Hitch was". Simon quotes Donald Spoto's book The Dark Side of Genius (1983), in which Hedren told Spoto [...] " [...] <b>was</b> <b>terribly</b> upset by all this"; screenwriter Evan Hunter said, [...] "e wanted to shoot it, but something in him didn't want to shoot it, and everybody could hear how nervous he was". Nancy deWolf Smith of The Wall Street Journal wrote that the film should not be viewed in terms of truths or untruths, but instead as [...] "an exquisitely lurid morality play in the Hitchcock style", calling The Girl [...] "an original masterpiece that pays tribute to Hitchcock's talent and vision".|$|E

500|$|She {{graduated}} from high school in 1918, and began working as a stenographer at a local law office. There she met Bernard Nevelson, co-owner with his brother Charles of the Nevelson Brothers Company, a shipping business. Bernard introduced her to his brother, and Charles and Louise Nevelson were married in June 1920 in a Jewish wedding at the Copley Plaza Hotel in Boston. Having satisfied her parent's hope that she would marry into a wealthy family, she and her new husband moved to New York City, where she began to study painting, drawing, singing, acting and dancing. She also became pregnant, and in 1922 she gave birth to her son Myron (later called Mike), who grew up to be a sculptor. Nevelson studied art, despite the disapproval of her parents-in-law. She commented: [...] "My husband's family <b>was</b> <b>terribly</b> refined. Within that circle you could know Beethoven, but God forbid if you were Beethoven." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I {{wanted to}} put two {{characters}} of flesh and bone {{in the middle of}} all these artificial creatures," [...] Henson explained, [...] "and David Bowie embodies a certain maturity, with his sexuality, his disturbing aspect, all sorts of things that characterize the adult world". Henson met David Bowie in the summer of 1983 to seek his involvement, as Bowie was in the U.S. for his Serious Moonlight Tour at the time. Henson continued to pursue Bowie for the role of Jareth, and sent him each revised draft of the film's script for his comments. During a meeting that took place on June 18, 1984, Henson showed Bowie The Dark Crystal and a selection of Brian Froud's concept drawings to pique his interest in the project. Bowie formally agreed to take part on February 15, 1985, several months before filming began. Discussing why he chose to be involved in the film, Bowie explained, [...] "I'd always wanted to be involved in the music-writing aspect of a movie that would appeal to children of all ages, as well as everyone else, and I must say that Jim gave me a completely free hand with it. The script itself <b>was</b> <b>terribly</b> amusing without being vicious or spiteful or bloody, and it had a lot more heart in it than many other special effects movies. So I was pretty hooked from the beginning." ...|$|E
