5|$|Senator Joseph S. Clark's and Senator Robert F. Kennedy's {{tour of the}} Mississippi Delta {{occurred}} on April 10, 1967. At the behest of civil rights lawyer Marian Wright, Clark and Kennedy, together with two other Senators, traveled to Mississippi to investigate reports of extreme poverty and starvation. Following a field hearing, they drove from Greenville to Clarkesdale, stopping and touring impoverished communities as they went. Deeply disturbed by what they saw, the senators returned to Washington D.C. and began pushing {{for a series of}} reforms to alleviate the situation. Extensive media coverage of the event exposed the American public to real instances of malnutrition and starvation. The country <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>and</b> hunger became an important topic nationwide as people began looking for solutions.

25|$|In 206 BC, Xiang Yu's army {{arrived at}} Hangu Pass (eastern gateway to Guanzhong) and Liu ordered {{his men to}} prevent Xiang's forces from {{entering}} Guanzhong. Xiang Yu was furious when he learnt that Liu Bang had beat him {{in the race to}} Guanzhong, and he wanted to kill Liu after being instigated by Fan Zeng and a defector from Liu's side, Cao Wushang. Xiang Yu's uncle, Xiang Bo, was an old friend of Zhang Liang and he secretly warned Zhang that Xiang Yu was planning to attack Liu Bang. Liu Bang <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>and</b> fearful when he heard that, as his forces were too weak to counter Xiang Yu. Zhang Liang advised Liu Bang to attend the Feast at Hong Gate hosted by Xiang Yu, to put Xiang off guard and dismiss Xiang's suspicions that Liu was intending to oppose him. With help from Xiang Bo, Liu Bang managed to survive the dangerous banquet and Xiang Yu dismissed the idea of killing Liu. However, Fan Zeng was dissatisfied and he asked Xiang Yu's cousin Xiang Zhuang to pretend to perform a sword dance and use the opportunity to kill Liu Bang. Xiang Bo intervened again and saved Liu Bang's life.|$|E
25|$|The British Chiefs of Staff decided {{early on}} to base the BPF in Australia rather than India. While it was {{apparent}} that Australia, with its population of only about seven million could not support the projected 675,000 {{men and women of the}} BPF, the actual extent of the Australian contribution was undetermined. The Australian government agreed to contribute to the support of the BPF but the Australian economy was fully committed to the war effort and manpower and stores for the BPF could only come from taking them from American and Australian forces fighting the Japanese. Unfortunately, Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser arrived in Sydney on 10 December 1944 under the mistaken impression that Australia had asked for the BPF and promised to provide for its needs. Two days later, the Acting Prime Minister of Australia Frank Forde announced the allocation of £21,156,500 for the maintenance of the BPF. In January 1945, General of the Army Douglas MacArthur agreed to release American stockpiles in Australia to support the BPF. The Australian government soon became concerned at the voracious demands of the BPF works programme, which was criticised by Australian military leaders. In April 1945, Fraser publicly criticised the Australian government's handling of waterside industrial disputes that were holding up British ships. The government <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>and</b> angered but agreed to allocate £6,562,500 for BPF naval works. Fraser was not satisfied. On 8 August 1945, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Clement Attlee felt obliged to express his regret for the misunderstandings to the Australian government.|$|E

25|$|For {{several months}} prior to Survivor Series, Hart and Shawn Michaels had several {{backstage}} arguments including a fight before a house show in Hartford, Connecticut (after Michaels had publicly accused Hart of {{having an affair with}} Sunny), which saw Michaels suspended for two months. After a show in San Jose, California on October 12, 1997, Hart claimed he spoke to Michaels about being professional and trusting one another in the ring. Hart allegedly said he would have no problem losing to Michaels if McMahon requested. Hart also claimed that when Michaels replied that he would never lose to Hart, Bret <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>and</b> became angry. This led to Hart's outright refusal to lose the WWF World Heavyweight Championship to Michaels at the pay-per-view event in Montreal, although in , Hart states to McMahon that he would happily drop the belt but not in Canada. However, in his own autobiography, Michaels refuted Hart's claim, saying that he would have cleanly lost to Hart had storylines demanded so (however others, including Jim Cornette in various shoot interviews, have often refuted this saying that they knew first hand that Michaels had no intention of jobbing to Hart). Michaels also pointed out that he had lost cleanly to Hart several times in the past, most notably in the WWF's first ever ladder match at a Wrestling Challenge taping on July 21, 1992, which would subsequently be made available on multiple Coliseum/WWE Home Video releases and in the main event of Survivor Series 1992. Michaels also lost to Hart in a Steel Cage match in December 1993.|$|E
500|$|Garfield {{opposed the}} initial talk of impeaching President Johnson when Congress convened in December 1866. However, he {{supported}} legislation to limit Johnson's powers, {{such as the}} Tenure of Office Act, which restricted Johnson in removing presidential appointees. Distracted by committee duties, he rarely spoke in connection with these bills, but was a loyal Republican vote against Johnson. [...] Due to a court case, he was absent on the day in April 1868 when the House impeached Johnson, but soon gave a speech aligning himself with Thaddeus Stevens and others who sought Johnson's removal. When the president was acquitted in trial before the Senate, Garfield <b>was</b> <b>shocked,</b> <b>and</b> blamed {{the outcome of the}} trial on its presiding officer, Chief Justice Chase, his onetime mentor.|$|E

500|$|While these folklore-gathering trips {{were going}} on, Andrade {{developed}} {{a group of}} friends among young artists and writers in São Paulo, who, like him, were aware of the growing modernist movement in Europe. [...] Several of them were later known as the Grupo dos Cinco (the Group of Five): Andrade, poets Oswald de Andrade (no relation) and Menotti del Picchia, and artists Tarsila do Amaral and Anita Malfatti. [...] Malfatti had been to Europe before World War I, and introduced São Paulo to expressionism. [...] Jack E. Tomlins, the translator of Andrade's second book, describes in his introduction a particularly crucial event in the development of Andrade's modernist philosophy. [...] In 1920, he had recently met the modernist sculptor Victor Brecheret, and bought a sculpture from him entitled [...] "Bust of Christ," [...] which depicted Christ as a Brazilian with braided hair. [...] His family (apparently to his surprise) <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>and</b> furious. [...] Andrade retreated to his room alone, and later recalled, in a lecture translated by Tomlins, that—still [...] "delirious"—he went out onto his balcony and [...] "looked down at the square below without actually seeing it." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{signing the}} group, Virgin Records {{launched}} a major campaign for their debut song to promote {{them as the}} new high-profile act. There {{was a period of}} indecision about what song would be released as the first single; the label wanted to get everything right for the campaign, because the all-girl group format was untested. The group, led by Brown and Halliwell, was adamant that the debut song should be [...] "Wannabe", they felt it served as an introduction to their personalities and the Girl Power statement. Virgin's executives believed that the first single should either be [...] "Say You'll Be There", which they considered a much [...] "cooler" [...] track, or [...] "Love Thing". At the beginning of 1996 the impasse between the group and their record label about the release of the single was temporarily solved. In March, Fuller announced that he agreed with Virgin in that [...] "Wannabe" [...] should not be the first single. The label wanted a song that appealed to the mainstream market, and nothing considered too radical. Halliwell <b>was</b> <b>shocked</b> <b>and</b> furious; she told Fuller, [...] "It's not negotiable as far as we're concerned. 'Wannabe' is our first single." [...] Fuller and the executives at Virgin relented, and the song was chosen as their first single.|$|E
