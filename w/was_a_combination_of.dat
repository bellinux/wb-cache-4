The derailment, which saw all bar two carriages rolled over entirely, cost two passengers their lives, with eight more seriously hurt and a further 34 suffering minor injuries such as shock.|$|E

5|$|Typically, {{tropical}} cyclones do {{not form}} in the South Atlantic Ocean, due to strong upper level shear, cool water temperatures, {{and the lack of}} a convergence zone of convection. Occasionally though, as seen in 1991 and early 2004, conditions can become slightly more favorable. For Catarina, it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> climatic and atmospheric anomalies. Water temperatures on Catarina's path ranged from 24 to 25°C, slightly less than the 26.5°C temperature of a normal tropical cyclone, but sufficient for a storm of baroclinic origin.|$|E

5|$|By contract, the top {{two teams}} in the BCS Poll at the {{conclusion}} of the regular season were invited to the BCS national championship game. In 2000, the BCS Poll <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> four different systems: media and coaches' polls (Associated Press college football poll and USA Today Coaches' Poll), team records, a collection of eight different computer ranking systems, and a strength-of-schedule component based on opponent records. Under the BCS, the site of the national championship game rotated every year. In 2000, there were four BCS bowl games: the Rose Bowl, the Sugar Bowl, the Orange Bowl, and the Fiesta Bowl. The national championship game rotated to a different location each year, and the other three games served as bowl games for lower-ranked teams. Later, in 2007, the BCS National Championship was created, adding a fifth BCS bowl. In 2000, the Sugar Bowl was scheduled to host the national championship game.|$|E
5|$|Figures for troops {{involved}} in ancient battles are often unreliable, and Cannae is no exception. They {{should be treated}} with caution, especially those for the Carthaginian side. The Carthaginian army <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> warriors from numerous regions, and may have numbered between 40,000-50,000. Along with the core of an estimated 8,000 Libyans, there were 8,000 Iberians, 16,000 Gauls (8,000 were left at camp the day of battle) and around 5,500 Gaetulian infantry. Hannibal's cavalry also came from diverse backgrounds. He commanded 4,000 Numidian, 2,000 Iberian, 4,000 Gallic and 450 Libyan-Phoenician cavalry. Finally, Hannibal had around 8,000 skirmishers consisting of Balearic slingers and mixed-nationality spearmen. The uniting factor for the Carthaginian army was the personal tie each group had with Hannibal.|$|E
5|$|In 1746 Franklin {{began working}} on {{electrical}} experiments with Ebenezer Kinnersley after he bought all of Archibald Spencer's electrical equipment that he used in his lectures. Later he was also associated with Thomas Hopkinson and Philip Syng in experimentation with electricity. In the summer of 1747 they had received an electrical system from Thomas Penn. While no records exists to tell us exactly what parts {{were included in the}} system, historian J. A. Leo LeMay believes it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> an electricity generating machine, a Leyden jar, a glass tube, and a stool that was electrically insulated from the ground. This gave Franklin a complete system to experiment with generating and storing electricity.|$|E

5|$|In China, the {{art form}} has been known by many other names in {{different}} times and places. The earliest Chinese name <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> the Xipi and Erhuang melodies, and was called Pi Huang. As it increased in popularity, its name became Jingju or Jingxi, which reflected its start in the capital city, Jing, and {{the form of the}} performance, Xi. From 1927 to 1949, Beijing was known as Beiping, and Peking opera was known as Pingxi or Pingju (Traditional 平劇, Simplified 平剧) to reflect this change. Finally, with the establishment of the People's Republic of China, the name of the capital city was reverted to Beijing, and the formal name of Beijing theatre in Mainland China was established as Jingju. The Taiwanese name for this type of opera, Guoju, national theatre style, reflects disputes over the true seat of the Chinese government.|$|E

5|$|Superman is {{well known}} for its {{large-scale}} visual effects sequences, all of which were created before the digital age.

Young Clark Kent's long-distance football punt was executed with a wooden football loaded into an air blaster placed in the ground.

In addition to the add-on models, Sega also released the Genesis CDX (Multi-Mega in Europe). This console <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> the Genesis and Sega CD in one unit and initially retailed at US$399. Unique to this model was its additional functionality as a portable compact disc player.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{was followed by}} a national day of mourning in Canada, and a ban on all E350 Ford Club Wagon type vehicles being used for student transport in New Brunswick. Two investigations, one by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and the other by Transport Canada, found that the cause of the disaster <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> poor road conditions, lack of proper snow tires, and possible driver error. Pressure from the public and victims' families prompted the chief coroner of the province to launch an inquiry, which produced recommendations to improve student transport safety in New Brunswick. The provincial government agreed with the majority of the suggestions and has since enacted many of them.|$|E
5|$|The {{avalanche}} {{scenes were}} due to be filmed in co-operation with the Swiss army who annually used explosions to prevent snow build-up by causing avalanches, but the area chosen naturally avalanched just before filming. The final result <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>combination</b> <b>of</b> a man-made avalanche at an isolated Swiss location shot by the second unit, stock footage, and images created by the special effects crew with salt. The stuntmen were filmed later, added by optical effects. For the scene where Bond and Tracy crash into a car race while being pursued, an ice rink was constructed over an unused aeroplane track, with water and snow sprayed on it constantly. Lazenby and Rigg {{did most of the}} driving due to the high number of close-ups.|$|E
