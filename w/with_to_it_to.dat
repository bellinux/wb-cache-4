New Trends in Dentistry The main emphasis in dentistry is changing from a primarily technical operation to an increasingly personal service. More succinctly expressed by Walsh (1966), "Dental education and practice is moving from a two-dimensional concept based on technology and science into a third personal or psychosocial dimension (p. 480). " This transition is in part made possible by the delegation of many of the dentist's technical duties to auxiliary personnel. Consequently, the dentist is now finding himself able to spend more of his energies in the interactive aspects of his profession like motivating, consulting, and educating, not onl...|$|R
30|$|Table  4 reports both {{estimates}} and average partial {{effects of the}} semiparametric ordered response models. The semiparametric estimation {{is based on the}} index representation of the model variables with normalized coefficients by coefficient of one of model’s continuous variables. Since parametrically estimated models show a positive and statistically significant estimate on the age variable, we normalized other coefficients of the model using this variable. 5 The positive coefficient on age allows us to consistently estimate signs of normalized coefficients of other variables. Its significance allows ratios of other coefficients <b>with</b> respect <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be finite. Taking into account the positive relationship between individual age and reported job satisfaction, we expect that the signs of the semiparametric estimates of variable coefficients would reflect the right direction of correlations. Table  4 shows that variables on intra- and inter-country wage differences, monthly consumption (pcnf), education from universities (heduc), male gender (male), affiliation with social security (ssec), working in a fixed building (fdpl), and working in the street or market (smpl) in the semiparametric model 1 and model 2 have the same sign effects on individual job satisfaction as in parametric models. Interesting to note is that the sign of living in the capital (capl) has changed (coefficient estimates of vocational education and number of children were not statistically significant), and the significance of coefficient estimates of variables has increased in semiparametrically estimated models 1 and 2, which might be due to our relaxed distributional assumptions.|$|R
40|$|Many future space {{missions}} {{will require}} that proximity operations be accomplished reliably, precisely and efficiently without a {{pilot in the}} loop. This thesis examines one element of an autonomous proximity operations controller, the trajectory planner. The trajectory planner uses a modified gradient search to find a locally optimal trajectory from the initial state to the target state that does not violate any of the mission constraints. The mission constraints are defined as the maximum time of flight for the operation, the maximum closing velocity allowed, and the obstacles {{in close proximity to}} the chase and target craft. The obstacles in this space are not assumed to be stationary; therefore, the planner must be able to develop a solution that, although not guaranteed globally optimal, meets all mission constraints-in real time. This will enable the autonomous controller to avoid obstacles moving rapidly <b>with</b> respect <b>to</b> <b>it</b> and <b>to</b> correct for failed actuators.
