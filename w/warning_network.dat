5|$|The Dnestr/Dnepr radars were {{intended}} {{to be replaced by}} the newer Daryal radars starting in the 1990s. Only two of the planned Daryal radars became operational, due to issues such as the dissolution of the Soviet Union. As of 2012, the Russian early <b>warning</b> <b>network</b> still consists of some radars of this vintage. It is likely that all the existing radars will be replaced by the third generation Voronezh radars by 2020.|$|E
5|$|Allied armies {{had also}} reached the pre-war German {{territorial}} borders and now occupied some German towns and cities. In the West the defeat in Normandy and the Allied advance across Western Europe had significant {{consequences for the}} Luftwaffe's ability to defend Germany from British night attacks. The Kammhuber Line—German air defence system—which had extended through occupied France, Belgium and the Netherlands was now broken and much of its early <b>warning</b> <b>network</b> had been lost. Along with the battlefield reverses was {{the inability of the}} Luftwaffe to produce enough experienced night fighter crews which was exacerbated by the crippling shortage of fuel at this stage in the war which contributed to the collapse of training programs and grounded combat units. Equally serious was the threat posed by RAF de Havilland Mosquito night fighter intruders operating over Germany.|$|E

40|$|Many serious {{automobile}} accidents {{could be}} avoided if drivers were warned of impending crashes before they occur. Creating such warning systems by hand, however, is a difficult and time-consuming task. This paper describes three advances toward evolving neural networks with NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) to warn about such crashes in real-world environments. First, NEAT was evaluated in a complex, dynamic simulation with other cars, where it outperformed three hand-coded strawman warning policies and generated warning levels comparable with those of an open-road warning system. Second, <b>warning</b> <b>networks</b> were trained using raw pixel data from a simulated camera. Surprisingly, NEAT was able to generate <b>warning</b> <b>networks</b> that performed similarly to those trained with higher-level input and still outperformed the baseline hand-coded warning policies. Third, the NEAT approach was evaluated {{in the real world}} using a robotic vehicle testbed. Despite noisy and ambiguous sensor data, NEAT successfully evolved <b>warning</b> <b>networks</b> using both laser rangefinders and visual sensors. The results in this paper set the stage for developing <b>warning</b> <b>networks</b> for real-world traffic, which may someday save lives in real vehicles...|$|R

25|$|After Mao died on September 9, 1976, his rival, Deng Xiaoping, denounced {{during the}} Cultural Revolution as reactionary and {{therefore}} forced {{to retire from}} all his offices, slowly re-emerged as China's new leader in 1978. At first, new development was slowed. Then, several key projects deemed unnecessary were simply cancelled—the Fanji ABM system, the Xianfeng Anti-Missile Super Gun, the ICBM Early <b>Warning</b> <b>Network</b> 7010 Tracking Radar and the land-based high-power anti-missile laser program. Nevertheless, some development did proceed.|$|E
25|$|The space {{surveillance}} {{network was}} part of the Soviet Air Defences, called the PVO, and was incorporated as part of the missile defence and space defence force. In 1998 SKKP became part of the missile and space defence organisation ракетно-космической обороны (RKO) together with missile <b>warning</b> <b>network</b> SPRN and the anti-missile forces. In 2001 these services became part of the newly founded Space Troops, and were incorporated as the 3rd Independent Missile and Space Defence Army.|$|E
50|$|Many {{air forces}} are also {{responsible}} for operations of the military space, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), and communications equipment. Some air forces may command and control other air defence assets such as anti-aircraft artillery, surface-to-air missiles, or anti-ballistic missile <b>warning</b> <b>networks</b> and defensive systems. Some nations, principally Russia, the former Soviet Union and countries who modelled their militaries along Soviet lines, have or had an air defence force which is organizationally separate from their air force.|$|R
50|$|After World War II most, if not all, early <b>warning</b> <b>networks</b> {{had been}} dismantled. At {{the height of}} the Cold War, {{paranoia}} ran deep within the halls of the United States military establishment. By 1949, the USSR had developed the atomic bomb and the capacity to deliver it by air. The United States considered that it needed to protect itself from the Soviets, formerly allies. To this end, the US constructed early-warning stations. This system was called the Distant Early Warning system or the DEW Line, which was a state of the art product.|$|R
50|$|Once the European {{invasion}} in June 1944 had stabilised and the Allied armies commenced an advance into France, the Nachtjagdgeschwadern found their early <b>warning</b> radar <b>network</b> and monitoring infrastructure increasingly compromised, as territory {{was lost to}} the Allies.|$|R
500|$|The port {{was subject}} to long range {{shelling}} by medium guns in Bardia, known to the Australians as [...] "Bardia Bill", and to Italian air attacks. Only one antiaircraft battery could be spared for Sallum. An air raid on Christmas Eve killed or wounded 60 New Zealanders and Cypriots. Without a proper <b>warning</b> <b>network,</b> interception was very difficult. However, on 26 December eight Gloster Gladiators of No. 3 Squadron RAAF sighted and attacked ten Savoia-Marchetti SM.79 bombers escorted by 24 Fiat CR.42 biplane fighters over the Gulf of Sallum. The Australians claimed to have shot down two CR 42s, while three Gladiators were damaged.|$|E
2500|$|The USAAF's Aircraft Warning Corps {{provided}} {{air defense}} warning with information centers that networked an area's [...] "Army Radar Stations" [...] which communicated radar tracks by telephone. [...] The AWC information centers also integrated visual reports processed by Ground Observer Corps filter centers. [...] AWC information centers notified air defense command posts of the [...] "4 continental air forces" [...] for deploying interceptor aircraft which used command guidance for ground-controlled interception. [...] The USAAF inactivated the aircraft <b>warning</b> <b>network</b> in April 1944.|$|E
2500|$|With {{advances}} in Soviet bombers, ADC completed improved radar networks and manned interceptors in the 1950s. At {{the end of}} the decade it computerized Air Defense Direction Centers to allow air defense controllers to more quickly review integrated military air defense warning (MADW) data and dispatch defenses (e.g., surface-to-air missiles in 1959). [...] ADC began missile warning and space surveillance missions in 1960 and 1961, and established a temporary missile <b>warning</b> <b>network</b> for the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1968 it was redesignated Aerospace Defense Command (ADCOM).|$|E
50|$|The {{role of the}} {{facility}} was to establish, integrate, and coordinate a nationwide early <b>warning</b> radar <b>network</b> in SFRJ akin to NORAD. The complex was designed and built to sustain a direct hit from a 20-kiloton nuclear bomb, equivalent to the one dropped on Nagasaki.|$|R
40|$|The Atlantic Richfield Hanford Company (ARHCO) has {{developed}} comprehensive plans {{for coping with}} emergencies ranging from criticality to civil disturbance. A unique notification system provides for immediate contact with key personnel by using a central communications center, crash alarm <b>warning</b> <b>networks,</b> and a continuing telephone cascade notification system. There is also the capability of immediately contacting other contractor key personnel. Certain jobs have been predetermined as necessary for coping with an emergency. An emergency staff consisting of responsible management, with alternates, has been preselected to automatically fill these jobs when notified. Control centers for headquarters and ''field'' are established with telephone and radio communication capabilities and are also supplied with some source materials to assist initiating plans for containing an emergency for recovery. A comprehensive emergency procedures manual has been developed, which contains information of company-wide application and procedures for specific facilities covering almost all accident situations.

The Duga-3 over-the-horizon radar array, several miles outside of Chernobyl, was the origin of the infamous Russian Woodpecker; it was {{designed}} as part of an anti-ballistic missile early <b>warning</b> radar <b>network.</b> With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Chernobyl remained part of Ukraine.|$|R
2500|$|The 820th Main Centre for Missile Attack Warning (...) is the Russian early <b>warning</b> <b>network</b> against {{ballistic}} missile attack. It has {{headquarters in the}} village of Timonovo [...] near Solnechnogorsk outside Moscow and is part of the Russian Space Forces. The centre consists of a network of early warning radar stations which transmit their data to the control centre near Solnechnogorsk. Other information comes from the early warning Oko and EKS satellites as well as the Don-2N missile defence radar. Information from the centre could be used for a launch on warning nuclear missile attack or to engage the A-135 anti-{{ballistic missile}} system.|$|E
2500|$|The 821st Main Space Intelligence Centre (...) is the {{headquarters}} of the Russian military's space surveillance network, SKKP. The centre is part of the Russian Space Forces and receives intelligence from a network of reporting stations which includes the Russian missile attack early <b>warning</b> <b>network</b> as well as some stations only used for space surveillance such as Okno and Krona. The purpose of SKKP is to detect satellites, identify them and to discern their orbits. It maintains the Russian catalogue of space objects and provides data which could be used to support space launches, feed an anti-satellite programme and provide intelligence on hostile military satellites. It is the Russian equivalent of the United States Space Surveillance Network.|$|E

40|$|The 2005 {{food crisis}} {{centered}} in Niger received worldwide attention and extensive media coverage. Crops suffered from poor rainfall and were plagued by locusts throughout the growing season. Malnutrition flourished with the sudden disruption in food supplies. One-fifth of Niger's children suffered from {{moderate to severe}} forms of malnutrition {{by the summer of}} 2005. In an era of increased awareness and the introduction of famine early warning systems, the development community was left wondering why they were for the most part caught off guard by the food crisis. This paper tests whether market prices and price discovery could have played an active role in detecting the food crisis. Directed acyclic graphs are used to test whether price discovery mechanisms within Niger's millet markets were ahead of the early warning systems. Results suggest that as early as October 2005 markets in Arlit and the Dosso province had price anomalies that appeared to begin signaling the upcoming food crisis. This market based discovery came about two months earlier than the warnings issued by the regional early <b>warning</b> <b>networks.</b> Food Security and Poverty,...|$|R
