5000|$|The <b>white-nosed</b> <b>coati</b> (Nasua narica), {{also known}} as the coatimundi (...) , is a species of coati {{and a member of the}} family Procyonidae (raccoons and relatives). Local names include pizote, antoon, and tejón. It weighs about 4 - 6 kg. However, males are much larger than females, and small females weigh as little as 2.5 kg and large males as much as 12.2 kg. On average, the total length is about 110 cm, about half of that being the tail length.|$|E
50|$|The South American coati, or ring-tailed coati (Nasua nasua), is {{a species}} of coati, members of the raccoon family (Procyonidae), from {{tropical}} and subtropical South America. In Brazilian Portuguese it is known as quati. Weight in this species is 2 - 7.2 kg and total length is 85 - 113 cm, half of that being its tail. Its color is highly variable and the rings on the tail may be quite weak, but it lacks the largely white muzzle ("nose") of its northern cousin, the <b>white-nosed</b> <b>coati.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The gray- and red fox {{are found}} {{throughout}} the South, while the swift fox is found in northern Texas and Oklahoma.

50|$|Carnivorans (order Carnivora) {{are native}} only to islands {{at the margins}} of the Caribbean. On Trinidad, the tayra (Eira barbara), the Neotropical otter (Lontra longicaudis), the ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), and the crab-eating raccoon (Procyon cancrivorus) have been recorded. Three carnivorans are known from the island of Cozumel off eastern Mexico, all of which are {{diminutive}} in size relative to their mainland relatives. The Cozumel coati, sometimes recognized as a separate species, Nasua nelsoni, belongs to the same species as the mainland <b>white-nosed</b> <b>coati</b> (Nasua narica), but the raccoon is still classified as a distinct species, the Cozumel raccoon (Procyon pygmaeus). The Cozumel fox, related to the mainland gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus), has yet to receive a scientific name. The kinkajou (Potos flavus) has been recorded a few times, but may not be native to the island. The greater grison (Galictis vittata) has also been recorded, but apparently in error.|$|E
50|$|They carve deep burrows into soil banks, {{which keeps}} them {{protected}} from predators, like the <b>white-nosed</b> <b>coati,</b> and {{enables them to}} ambush passing prey. The females spend {{the majority of their}} lives in their burrows. The burrows are typically located in or not far from vegetation and consist of a single entrance with a tunnel leading to one or two chambers. The entrance is just slightly larger than the body size of the spider. The tunnel, usually about three times the tarantula's leg span in length, leads to a chamber which is large enough for the spider to safely molt. Further down the burrow, via a shorter tunnel, a larger chamber is located where the spider rests and eats its prey. When the tarantula needs privacy, e.g. when molting or laying eggs, the entrance is sealed with silk sometimes supplemented with soil and leaves.|$|E

50|$|Ancon Hill is a 654-foot {{hill that}} overlooks Panama City, Panama, {{adjacent}} to the township of Ancón. Ancón Hill is an area in Panama that was used for administration of the Panama Canal. It was under U.S. jurisdiction {{as part of the}} Panama Canal Zone until being returned to Panama in 1977. Largely undeveloped, the area is now a reserve. The hill includes the highest point in Panama City. The summit of the hill can be reached by a 30-minute hike. According to a local Ancon resident, at this time it is no longer possible to drive to the summit of Cerro Ancon (February 12, 2017). Relatively undeveloped it includes jungle in an otherwise urban area, and wildlife still survives cut off from other jungle areas. It is not uncommon to see sloths, <b>white-nosed</b> <b>coati,</b> nine-banded armadillos, Geoffroy's tamarins, or deer on Ancon Hill, which now has protected status. Its name is used as an acronym by a Panamanian environmental group, Asociación Nacional para la Conservación de la Naturaleza (ANCON).|$|E

It is home to swift foxes, black-footed ferrets, and black-tailed prairie dogs. Pineywoods and Swamps represents East Texas. This section of the exhibit includes red wolves, river otters, alligators, and black bears. Gulf Coast is home to Southern Texas animals including the aquatic animals and waterfowl of the delta marsh, and includes an aviary that is home to birds including the roseate spoonbill and white and brown pelicans. Brush Country represents Southern Texas. This section includes bobcats, cougars, coyotes, jaguars, ocelots, ring-tailed cats, river otters, and <b>white-nosed</b> <b>coati,</b> as well as birds of prey which are the roadrunner, burrowing owl, and bald eagle. Mountains and Desert completes the tour in a mine shaft where visitors can see bats, dung beetles, Texas horned lizards, western diamondback rattlesnakes, and other animals endemic to the area.|$|E
50|$|Most animal {{sightings}} can {{be expected}} on the coastal track, with scarlet macaws (the largest population in the country) flying overhead, hermit crabs on the beach, pelicans fishing in the sea and, on the sections that go slightly inland, spider monkeys (take care not to get urinated on {{when they are in}} a tree overhead), tamandua anteaters, pumas, white faced capuchin monkeys, lineated woodpeckers and coatis (to name just a few). With luck one might even spot a tapir, even though they're nocturnal. Corcovado is also a good place to spot the red-eyed tree frog, as well as the glass frog with its transparent skin, and the enamel-bright poison-arrow frogs. From Estación Sirena one can follow many short tracks, on which one can also take short night-strolls into the forest with a good chance of running into a tapir. They're impressive to see but harmless if left in peace. Jaguars are present and some individuals frequent the beach near Madrigal at night. You are very likely to see their tracks, sometimes very fresh and frequent, but very unlikely to see the actual cat. The most common animal in the park is by far the <b>white-nosed</b> <b>coati,</b> which one can expect to encounter dozens of times on the beach hike between La Leona and Sirena, digging for and feeding on the abundant moon crabs.|$|E
40|$|Angiostrongylus costaricensis (Strongylida, Angiostrongylidae) is a {{roundworm}} of rodents, {{which may}} cause a severe or fatal zoonosis {{in several countries}} of the Americas. A single report indicated that the <b>white-nosed</b> <b>coati</b> (Nasua narica), acts as a potential free-ranging wildlife reservoir. Here we investigated the prevalence and features of A. costaricensis infection in two procyonid species, the <b>white-nosed</b> <b>coati</b> and the raccoon (Procyon lotor) from Costa Rica to better understand their possible role in the epidemiology of this zoonotic infection. Eighteen of 32 (56. 2 %) white-nosed coatis collected between July 2010 and March 2016 were infected with A. costaricensis but none of 97 raccoons from the same localities were diagnosed with this infection. First-stage larvae of A. costaricensis were obtained from feces of 17 fresh <b>white-nosed</b> <b>coati</b> carcasses by Baermann technique. Parasite identity was confirmed by morphology, histology and molecular characterization of target genes.
