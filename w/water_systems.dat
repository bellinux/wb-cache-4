5|$|By {{the time}} the Khmer Rouge {{initiated}} their dry-season offensive to capture the beleaguered Cambodian capital on 1 January 1975, the Republic was in chaos.

The cost of food was 20 times greater than pre-war levels and unemployment was not even measured anymore.|$|E
5|$|Other major streams that drained into Lake Cahuilla were Whitewater River {{from the}} north, and San Felipe Creek and Carrizo Creek from the southwest. More minor {{drainage}} came from Arroyo Salado {{on the western}} shore, and Salt Creek and Mammoth Wash on the eastern shore. Additional unnamed drainages did exist. Drainage from the Chocolate Mountains and the Cargo Muchacho Mountains may have reached the lake but are now buried by the Algodones Dunes. All these <b>water</b> <b>systems</b> are ephemeral.|$|E

5|$|Americans' {{eagerness to}} expand westward {{prompted}} {{a long series}} of American Indian Wars. The Louisiana Purchase of French-claimed territory in 1803 almost doubled the nation's area. The War of 1812, declared against Britain over various grievances and fought to a draw, strengthened U.S. nationalism. A series of military incursions into Florida led Spain to cede it and other Gulf Coast territory in 1819. Expansion was aided by steam power, when steamboats began traveling along America's large <b>water</b> <b>systems,</b> which were connected by new canals, such as the Erie and the I; then, even faster railroads began their stretch across the nation's land.|$|E

5|$|Many industrially {{important}} compounds, such as ammonia, nitric acid, organic nitrates (propellants and explosives), and cyanides, contain nitrogen. The extremely strong {{triple bond}} in elemental nitrogen (N≡N), the second strongest bond in any diatomic molecule after carbon monoxide (CO), dominates nitrogen chemistry. This causes difficulty for both organisms and industry in converting N2 into useful compounds, {{but at the}} same time means that burning, exploding, or decomposing nitrogen compounds to form nitrogen gas releases large amounts of often useful energy. Synthetically produced ammonia and nitrates are key industrial fertilisers, and fertiliser nitrates are key pollutants in the eutrophication of <b>water</b> <b>systems.</b>|$|E
