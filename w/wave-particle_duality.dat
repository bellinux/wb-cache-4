5|$|As {{with all}} particles, {{electrons}} {{can act as}} waves. This is called the <b>wave–particle</b> <b>duality</b> and can be demonstrated using the double-slit experiment.|$|E
5|$|Newton {{argued that}} light is {{composed}} of particles or corpuscles, which were refracted by accelerating into a denser medium. He verged on soundlike waves to explain the repeated pattern of reflection and transmission by thin films (Opticks Bk.II, Props. 12), but still retained his theory of 'fits' that disposed corpuscles to be reflected or transmitted (Props.13). However, later physicists favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light {{to account for the}} interference patterns and the general phenomenon of diffraction. Today's quantum mechanics, photons, and the idea of <b>wave–particle</b> <b>duality</b> bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, Louis de Broglie {{proposed}} that all moving particles—particularly subatomic particles such as electrons—exhibit {{a degree of}} wave-like behavior. Erwin Schrödinger, fascinated by this idea, explored {{whether or not the}} movement of an electron in an atom could be better explained as a wave rather than as a particle. Schrödinger's equation, published in 1926, describes an electron as a wavefunction instead of as a point particle. This approach elegantly predicted many of the spectral phenomena that Bohr's model failed to explain. Although this concept was mathematically convenient, it was difficult to visualize, and faced opposition. One of its critics, Max Born, proposed instead that Schrödinger's wavefunction described not the electron but rather all its possible states, and thus could be used to calculate the probability of finding an electron at any given location around the nucleus. This reconciled the two opposing theories of particle versus wave electrons and the idea of <b>wave–particle</b> <b>duality</b> was introduced. This theory stated that the electron may exhibit the properties of both a wave and a particle. For example, it can be refracted like a wave, and has mass like a particle.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, {{researchers}} from the University of Vienna demonstrated that <b>wave-particle</b> <b>duality</b> applied to molecules such as fullerene.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the use of}} the <b>wave-particle</b> <b>duality</b> {{has worked}} well in physics, the meaning or {{interpretation}} has not been satisfactorily resolved; see Interpretations of quantum mechanics.|$|E
25|$|It {{was found}} that {{subatomic}} particles and electromagnetic waves are neither simply particle nor wave but have certain properties of each. This originated the concept of <b>wave–particle</b> <b>duality.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to draw a line separating <b>wave–particle</b> <b>duality</b> from the rest of quantum mechanics, it is nevertheless possible to list some applications of this basic idea.|$|E
25|$|<b>Wave–particle</b> <b>duality</b> is {{exploited}} in electron microscopy, {{where the}} small wavelengths {{associated with the}} electron {{can be used to}} view objects much smaller than what is visible using visible light.|$|E
25|$|The wave {{function}} expresses a necessary and fundamental <b>wave–particle</b> <b>duality.</b> This should {{be reflected in}} ordinary language accounts of experiments. An experiment can show particle-like properties, or wave-like properties, according to the complementarity principle of Niels Bohr.|$|E
25|$|Below is an {{illustration}} of <b>wave–particle</b> <b>duality</b> {{as it relates to}} De Broglie's hypothesis and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle (above), in terms of the position and momentum space wavefunctions for one spinless particle with mass in one dimension. These wavefunctions are Fourier transforms of each other.|$|E
25|$|Quantum {{mechanics}} {{differs from}} classical physics in that: energy, momentum and other quantities {{of a system}} may be restricted to discrete values (quantization), objects have characteristics of both particles and waves (<b>wave-particle</b> <b>duality),</b> and {{there are limits to}} the precision with which quantities can be known (uncertainty principle).|$|E
25|$|Relational quantum {{mechanics}} {{has been developed}} {{as a point of}} view that regards the event of particle detection as having established a relationship between the quantized field and the detector. The inherent ambiguity associated with applying Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle is consequently avoided; hence there is no <b>wave-particle</b> <b>duality.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Gunther has {{embarked}} on joint research into quantum information systems based on photonics. During {{the course of his}} research in this area, he has developed a theory of photon bifurcation that is currently being tested experimentally at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne. This represents yet another application of path integral formulation to circumvent the <b>wave-particle</b> <b>duality</b> of light.|$|E
25|$|After that, the corpuscular {{theory of}} light was vanquished, {{not to be}} heard of again until in a very {{different}} form, the 20th century revived it as the newly developed <b>wave-particle</b> <b>duality.</b> Arago later noted that the diffraction bright spot (which later became known as both the Arago spot and the Poisson spot) had already been observed by Joseph-Nicolas Delisle and Giacomo F. Maraldi a century earlier.|$|E
25|$|Still in {{the days}} of the old quantum theory, a pre-quantum-mechanical version of <b>wave–particle</b> <b>duality</b> was pioneered by William Duane, and {{developed}} by others including Alfred Landé. Duane explained diffraction of x-rays by a crystal in terms solely of their particle aspect. The deflection of the trajectory of each diffracted photon was explained as due to quantized momentum transfer from the spatially regular structure of the diffracting crystal.|$|E
25|$|On {{his return}} from Russia, Bothe {{continued}} his employment at the PTR under Hans Geiger in the Laboratory for Radioactivity there. In 1924, Bothe published on his coincidence method. Then and in the following years, he applied this method to the experimental study of the nuclear reactions, the Compton effect, and the <b>wave–particle</b> <b>duality</b> of light. Bothe's coincidence method and his applications of it earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1954.|$|E
25|$|De Broglie {{himself had}} {{proposed}} a pilot wave construct {{to explain the}} observed <b>wave-particle</b> <b>duality.</b> In this view, each particle has a well-defined position and momentum, but is guided by a wave function derived from Schrödinger's equation. The pilot wave theory was initially rejected because it generated non-local effects when applied to systems involving more than one particle. Non-locality, however, soon became established as an integral feature of quantum theory (see EPR paradox), and David Bohm extended de Broglie's model to explicitly include it.|$|E
25|$|A phonon is {{a quantum}} {{mechanical}} description of an elementary vibrational motion {{in which a}} lattice of atoms or molecules uniformly oscillates at a single frequency. In classical mechanics this designates a normal mode of vibration. Normal modes are important because any arbitrary lattice vibration can {{be considered to be}} a superposition of these elementary vibration modes (cf. Fourier analysis). While normal modes are wave-like phenomena in classical mechanics, phonons have particle-like properties too, in a way related to the <b>wave–particle</b> <b>duality</b> of quantum mechanics.|$|E
25|$|The {{photoelectric}} effect helped to propel the then-emerging concept of <b>wave–particle</b> <b>duality</b> {{in the nature}} of light. Light simultaneously possesses the characteristics of both waves and particles, each being manifested according to the circumstances. The effect was impossible to understand in terms of the classical wave description of light, as the energy of the emitted electrons did not depend on the intensity of the incident radiation. Classical theory predicted that the electrons would 'gather up' energy over a period of time, and then be emitted.|$|E
25|$|In addition, general {{relativity}} {{is inconsistent with}} quantum mechanics, the physical theory that describes the <b>wave–particle</b> <b>duality</b> of matter, and quantum mechanics does not currently describe gravitational attraction at relevant (microscopic) scales. There {{is a great deal}} of speculation in the physics community as to the modifications that might be needed to both {{general relativity}} and quantum mechanics in order to unite them consistently. The speculative theory that unites general relativity and quantum mechanics is usually called quantum gravity, prominent examples of which include String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity.|$|E
25|$|Bohr was {{the first}} to point out the ‘indivisibility of the quantum of action’, his way of {{describing}} the uncertainty principle, implying that not all aspects of a system can be viewed simultaneously. For example, the <b>wave–particle</b> <b>duality</b> of physical objects are such complementary phenomena. Both concepts are borrowed from classical mechanics, i.e., measurements such as the double-slit experiment can demonstrate one or the other, but not both phenomena at a particular moment in time or position in space. It is impossible to empirically demonstrate both phenomena simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|Electron {{diffraction}} {{refers to}} the wave nature of electrons. However, from a technical or practical point of view, it may {{be regarded as a}} technique used to study matter by firing electrons at a sample and observing the resulting interference pattern. This phenomenon is commonly known as <b>wave–particle</b> <b>duality,</b> which states that a particle of matter (in this case the incident electron) can be described as a wave. For this reason, an electron can be regarded as a wave much like sound or water waves. This technique is similar to X-ray and neutron diffraction.|$|E
25|$|<b>Wave–particle</b> <b>duality</b> {{is deeply}} {{embedded}} into {{the foundations of}} quantum mechanics. In the formalism of the theory, all the information about a particle is encoded in its wave function, a complex-valued function roughly analogous to the amplitude of a wave at each point in space. This function evolves according to a differential equation (generically called the Schrödinger equation). For particles with mass this equation has solutions that follow {{the form of the}} wave equation. Propagation of such waves leads to wave-like phenomena such as interference and diffraction. Particles without mass, like photons, have no solutions of the Schrödinger equation so have another wave.|$|E
25|$|In 1913, {{he joined}} the newly created Laboratory for Radioactivity at the Reich Physical and Technical Institute (PTR), where he {{remained}} until 1930, the latter few years {{as the director of}} the laboratory. He served in the military during World War I from 1914, and he was a prisoner of war of the Russians, returning to Germany in 1920. Upon his return to the laboratory, he developed and applied coincidence methods to the study of nuclear reactions, the Compton effect, cosmic rays, and the <b>wave–particle</b> <b>duality</b> of radiation, for which he would receive the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1954.|$|E
25|$|A {{dramatic}} {{series of}} experiments emphasizing the action of gravity in relation to <b>wave–particle</b> <b>duality</b> was conducted in the 1970s using the neutron interferometer. Neutrons, one {{of the components of}} the atomic nucleus, provide much of the mass of a nucleus and thus of ordinary matter. In the neutron interferometer, they act as quantum-mechanical waves directly subject to the force of gravity. While the results were not surprising since gravity was known to act on everything, including light (see tests of general relativity and the Pound–Rebka falling photon experiment), the self-interference of the quantum mechanical wave of a massive fermion in a gravitational field had never been experimentally confirmed before.|$|E
25|$|The {{photoelectric}} effect requires photons with energies approaching zero (in {{the case of}} negative electron affinity) to over 1 MeV for core electrons in elements with a high atomic number. Emission of conduction electrons from typical metals usually requires a few electron-volts, corresponding to short-wavelength visible or ultraviolet light. Study of the {{photoelectric effect}} led to important steps in understanding the quantum nature of light and electrons and influenced {{the formation of the}} concept of <b>wave–particle</b> <b>duality.</b> Other phenomena where light affects the movement of electric charges include the photoconductive effect (also known as photoconductivity or photoresistivity), the photovoltaic effect, and the photoelectrochemical effect.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, Albert Einstein solved this {{apparent}} paradox by describing light as composed of discrete quanta, now called photons, rather than continuous waves. Based upon Max Planck's theory of black-body radiation, Einstein theorized {{that the energy}} in each quantum of light was equal to the frequency multiplied by a constant, later called Planck's constant. A photon above a threshold frequency has the required energy to eject a single electron, creating the observed effect. This discovery led to the quantum revolution in physics and earned Einstein the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. By <b>wave-particle</b> <b>duality</b> the effect can be analyzed purely in terms of waves though not as conveniently.|$|E
25|$|Einstein was {{the first}} {{physicist}} to say that Planck's discovery of the quantum (h) would require a rewriting {{of the laws of}} physics. To support his point, in 1905 he proposed that light sometimes acts as a particle which he called a light quantum (see photon and <b>wave–particle</b> <b>duality).</b> Bohr {{was one of the most}} vocal opponents of the photon idea and did not openly embrace it until 1925. The photon appealed to Einstein because he saw it as a physical reality (although a confusing one) behind the numbers. Bohr disliked it because it made the choice of mathematical solution arbitrary. He did not like a scientist's having to choose between equations.|$|E
25|$|In quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger {{equation}} is a mathematical equation {{that describes the}} changes over time of a physical system in which quantum effects, such as <b>wave–particle</b> <b>duality,</b> are significant. The {{equation is}} a mathematical formulation for studying quantum mechanical systems. It is considered a central result {{in the study of}} quantum systems and its derivation was a significant landmark in developing the theory of quantum mechanics. It was named after Erwin Schrödinger, who derived the equation in 1925 and published it in 1926, forming the basis for his work that resulted in Schrödinger being awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933. The equation is a type of differential equation known as a wave-equation, which serves as a mathematical model of the movement of waves.|$|E
25|$|The {{uncertainty}} principle states that no object can ever have precise values of position and velocity simultaneously. The total {{energy of a}} quantum mechanical object (potential and kinetic) is described by its Hamiltonian which also describes {{the system as a}} harmonic oscillator, or wave function, that fluctuates between various energy states (see <b>wave-particle</b> <b>duality).</b> All quantum mechanical systems undergo fluctuations even in their ground state, a consequence of their wave-like nature. The {{uncertainty principle}} requires every quantum mechanical system to have a fluctuating zero-point energy greater than the minimum of its classical potential well. This results in motion even at absolute zero. For example, liquid helium does not freeze under atmospheric pressure regardless of temperature due to its zero-point energy.|$|E
25|$|Huygens had experimented in 1672 {{with double}} {{refraction}} (birefringence) in Icelandic spar (calcite), a phenomenon discovered in 1669 by Rasmus Bartholin. At first {{he could not}} elucidate what he found. He later explained it with his wave front theory and concept of evolutes. He also developed ideas on caustics. Newton in his Opticks of 1704 proposed instead a corpuscular theory of light. The theory of Huygens was not accepted, by some, because longitudinal waves cannot show birefringence. The interference experiments of Thomas Young vindicated a wave theory in 1801: the results could not be explained with light particles. The {{solution to the problem}} Huygens had faced was then resolved by a transverse wave theory. For a view from modern physics see <b>wave–particle</b> <b>duality.</b>|$|E
25|$|Following the {{development}} of quantum field theory the ambiguity disappeared. The field permits solutions that follow the wave equation, which {{are referred to as}} the wave functions. The term particle is used to label the irreducible representations of the Lorentz group that are permitted by the field. An interaction as in a Feynman diagram is accepted as a calculationally convenient approximation where the outgoing legs are known to be simplifications of the propagation and the internal lines are for some order in an expansion of the field interaction. Since the field is non-local and quantized, the phenomena which previously were thought of as paradoxes are explained. Within the limits of the <b>wave-particle</b> <b>duality</b> the quantum field theory gives the same results.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{version of}} this experiment involves single particles (or waves—for consistency, they are called particles here). Sending particles through a double-slit apparatus {{one at a time}} results in single particles appearing on the screen, as expected. Remarkably, however, an interference pattern emerges when these particles are allowed to build up one by one (see the adjacent image). This demonstrates the <b>wave–particle</b> <b>duality,</b> which states that all matter exhibits both wave and particle properties: the particle is measured as a single pulse at a single position, while the wave describes the probability of absorbing the particle at a specific place on the screen. This phenomenon has been shown to occur with photons, electrons, atoms and even some molecules, including buckyballs. So experiments with electrons add confirmatory evidence to the view that electrons, protons, neutrons, and even larger entities that are ordinarily called particles nevertheless have their own wave nature and even a wavelength (related to their momentum).|$|E
25|$|Isaac Newton (1643–1727) {{investigated}} the refraction of light, demonstrating that a prism could decompose white light into {{a spectrum of}} colours, and that a lens and a second prism could recompose the multicoloured spectrum into white light. He also showed that the coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects. Newton noted that {{regardless of whether it}} was reflected or scattered or transmitted, it stayed the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour. From this work he concluded that any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours, and invented a reflecting telescope (today known as a Newtonian telescope) to bypass that problem. By grinding his own mirrors, using Newton's rings to judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes, he was able to produce a superior instrument to the refracting telescope, due primarily to the wider diameter of the mirror. In 1671 the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes On Colour, which he later expanded into his Opticks. Newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles and were refracted by accelerating toward the denser medium, but he had to associate them with waves to explain the diffraction of light (Opticks Bk. II, Props. XII-L). Later physicists instead favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for diffraction. Today's quantum mechanics, photons and the idea of <b>wave-particle</b> <b>duality</b> bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light.|$|E
