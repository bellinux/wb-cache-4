25|$|I must own, I cannot {{conceive}} what {{ideas of}} art and dramatic connexion those persons have who suppose that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>at</b> pleasure tack a double conclusion to a tragedy; a melancholy one for hard-hearted spectators, and a happy one for souls of a softer mould. After surviving so many sufferings, Lear can only die, and what more truly tragic end for him than to die from grief {{for the death of}} Cordelia? and if he is also to be saved and to pass the remainder of his days in happiness, the whole loses its signification.|$|E
25|$|Imperatives {{are either}} {{hypothetical}} or categorical. Hypothetical imperatives provide the rules an agent must follow when she adopts a contingent end (an end based on desire or inclination). So, for example, if I want ice cream, I {{should go to}} the ice cream shop or make myself some ice cream. But notice that this imperative only applies if I want ice cream. If I have no interest in ice cream, the imperative does not apply to me. Kant thinks that {{there are two types of}} hypothetical imperative—rules of skill and counsels of prudence. Rules of skill are determined by the particular ends we set and tell us what is necessary to achieve those particular ends. However, Kant observes that there is one end that we all share, namely our own happiness. Unfortunately, it is difficult, if not impossible, to know what will make us happy or how to achieve the things that will make us happy. Therefore, Kant argues, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>at</b> best have counsels of prudence, as opposed to outright rules.|$|E
500|$|Himmler was {{inspired}} by the noted successes of the Bosnian-Herzegovinian Infantry in World War I. He [...] "endeavored to restore what he called 'an old Austrian' tradition by reviving the Bosnian regiments of the former Austro-Hungarian Army {{in the form of a}} Bosnian Muslim SS Division". Once raised, the division was to engage and destroy Josip Broz Tito's Partisan forces operating in north-eastern Bosnia, thus restoring local [...] "order". Himmler's primary concern in the region was not the security of the local Muslim population, but the welfare of ethnic German settlers to the north in Syrmia. [...] "Srem (Syrmia) is the breadbasket of Croatia, and hopefully it and our beloved German settlements will be secured. I hope that the area south of Srem will be liberated by... the Bosnian division... so that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>at</b> least restore partial order in this ridiculous (Croatian) state." ...|$|E

(This operator is actually [...] "essentially self-adjoint.")

Sun Chen executed Zhu Yi and returned to Jiangdong. He is actually putting on a front when he sent troops to help us.

2500|$|Blumenthal {{has been}} a vocal {{advocate}} of the position that human activity is responsible for rising global temperatures and that prompt action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions must be taken.
