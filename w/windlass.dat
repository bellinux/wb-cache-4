5|$|Ramp stubs for {{the planned}} <b>Windlass</b> Freeway are {{present at the}} {{proposed}} west end at I-95 and Moravia Road, and at the present east end at the Southeast Freeway. The junction of the <b>Windlass</b> and Patapsco Freeways was originally built with provisions for extensions of each, but this has since been reconstructed.|$|E
5|$|At {{the northeastern}} terminus, the Baltimore Beltway was planned to extend {{southeast}} along the Back River Neck peninsula and turn south {{to cross the}} river near the Essex Skypark Airport, heading towards an outer crossing of the Patapsco River. Part of this alignment was completed south of US 40 in 1972 with a further extension to MD 150 opening as the Southeast Freeway (designated MD 702) by 1975. However, the Baltimore Beltway was diverted to two freeways not planned {{to be part of}} it. The first was the <b>Windlass</b> Freeway (MD 149), a route planned to run from I-95 at Moravia Road northeast to Chase, paralleling US 40 to the south. The other freeway that was incorporated into the Baltimore Beltway was the Patapsco Freeway, a short connector from the <b>Windlass</b> Freeway southeast to the originally-planned Baltimore Beltway. Only the segment of the <b>Windlass</b> Freeway between MD 702 the planned intersection with the Patapsco Freeway south to MD 151 (North Point Boulevard) were constructed, opening to traffic in 1973.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Windlass</b> Room, or Winch Room, {{is in the}} Gatehouse, entered {{from the}} Drawing Room. It {{contains}} a working mechanism for operating the drawbridge and the portcullis. The equipment was originally intended for the second floor, which Burges considered the most historically authentic location. When later design modifications led him to move Lord Bute's Bedroom into that space, the equipment was simplified and placed on the first floor. The <b>Windlass</b> Room includes murder holes, which Burges thought would have enabled medieval inhabitants of the castle to pour boiling water and oil on attackers.|$|E

50|$|Apart from treadwheels, medieval depictions {{also show}} cranes {{to be powered}} {{manually}} by <b>windlasses</b> with radiating spokes, cranks and by the 15th century also by <b>windlasses</b> shaped like a ship's wheel. To smooth out irregularities of impulse and get over 'dead-spots' in the lifting process flywheels {{are known to be}} in use as early as 1123.|$|R
5|$|Disruptions in the plantar fascia's normal {{mechanical}} movement during standing and walking (known as the <b>Windlass</b> mechanism) {{are thought to}} {{contribute to the development of}} plantar fasciitis by placing excess strain on the calcaneal tuberosity. Other studies have also suggested that plantar fasciitis is not actually due to inflamed plantar fascia, but may be a tendon injury involving the flexor digitorum brevis muscle located immediately deep to the plantar fascia.|$|E
5|$|Continuing south, the Baltimore Beltway officially becomes MD 695 again, {{despite being}} signed as I-695, and soon {{encounters}} MD 7 (Philadelphia Road). Between I-95 and MD 7, the route’s changes from eastwest to northsouth. Immediately after MD 7, the route interchanges with US 40 (Pulaski Highway) northwest of Essex near The Centre at Golden Ring. After US 40, I-695 crosses over CSX’s Philadelphia Subdivision {{and comes to}} a partial directional interchange with MD 702 (Southeast Boulevard). At this interchange, I-695 turns south onto the <b>Windlass</b> Freeway, crossing over the Northeast Corridor again within the interchange.|$|E
5|$|When {{the weather}} improved, work {{commenced}} outside. The cap circle was mostly constructed {{before the first}} work-in commenced. The work-ins took place over two separate weeks in July and August, with 35 people participating. During the first work-in, the fantail posts and braces were fitted. The oak cap ribs, which had been prefabricated offsite were fitted and the finial was supported by scaffolding ready for final fitting. Intermdiate noggings of oak were fitted and the finial was pulled into position using a <b>windlass.</b> The cap frame was competed with the fitting of intermediate ribs and noggings. The rear of the cap circle was also completed during this time.|$|E

25|$|Materials : Early <b>windlasses</b> were {{individually}} hand forged from {{a single}} piece of wrought iron by a blacksmith. More modern techniques include casting of iron or bronze, drop forging and (the most common technique) welding. Some boatmen had their <b>windlasses</b> 'silvered' (or chrome plated) for increased comfort and to prevent rusting. <b>Windlasses</b> are now only rarely plated, but a popular modern choice of metal is aluminium, whose smooth and rustproof surface has the same advantages of longevity and blister-reduction, and is also very light. One type of these, the Dunton Double, has only a single eye, but by clever tapering it will operate either size of spindle.|$|R

5|$|The {{builders}} {{would have}} made extensive use of cranes and block and tackle pulleys to lift the stones into place. Much of the work {{could have been done}} using simple sheers operated by a <b>windlass.</b> For the largest blocks, a massive human-powered treadmill would have been used; such machines were still being used in the quarries of Provence until as late as the start of the 20th century. A complex scaffold was erected to support the bridge as it was being built. Large blocks were left protruding from the bridge to support the frames and scaffolds used during construction. The aqueduct as a whole would have been a very expensive undertaking; Émile Espérandieu estimated the cost to be over 30 million sesterces, equivalent to 50 years' pay for 500 new recruits in a Roman legion.|$|E
5|$|Running {{south along}} the <b>Windlass</b> Freeway, {{parallel}} to the Northeast Corridor, I-695, now narrowed to four lanes, turns west before making a sharp turn to the south, crossing over the railroad line twice. The road becomes the Patapsco Freeway and continues south to an interchange with MD 150 (Eastern Avenue) and MD 157 (Merritt Boulevard) near the Eastpoint Mall. A short distance later, I-695 comes to an interchange with MD 151 (North Point Boulevard). From here, the route continues southeast along the Back River into residential and industrial Dundalk, interchanging with Cove Road. The route turns south, with the median briefly widening to include trees, before coming to another interchange with MD 151. Past MD 151, the Baltimore Beltway continues southwest through industrial areas, with maintenance switching to the Maryland Transportation Authority at the crossing of a CSX rail line. It comes to an interchange with MD 157 (Peninsula Expressway) and MD 158 (Bethlehem Boulevard) before heading west. The route runs past the Sparrows Point Industrial Complex before crossing over Bear Creek and interchanging with unsigned MD 695A (Broening Highway) south of the Dundalk Marine Terminal, with an eastbound exit and westbound entrance.|$|E
5|$|The highway veers {{northeast}} and crosses both the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision before Exit 13 with US 40 (Pulaski Highway) and MD 151 (Erdman Avenue); the entrance ramp {{extends from the}} US 40MD 151 partial cloverleaf interchange immediately {{to the north and}} west. After crossing Herring Run, I-895 meets Moravia Road at Exit 14, a five-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange that lacks an exit from northbound I-895, which is accessed via Exit 13 and a loop ramp to the northwest. This interchange complements Exit 60 off I-95, where the eastern terminus of Moravia Road meets the planned western terminus of the <b>Windlass</b> Freeway. A branch of the I-95 Express Toll Lanes begin within the interchange with Moravia Road, and there is a ramp from northbound I-895 to the northbound toll lanes. The highway crosses Moores Run before reaching its northern terminus at Exit 62 of I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway), a pair of flyover ramps from I-895 to northbound I-95 and from southbound I-95 to I-895 on the boundary between the city of Baltimore and the Baltimore County community of Rosedale.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{archaeology}} {{has led to}} {{the discovery}} of Han artwork portraying inventions which were otherwise absent in Han literary sources. This includes the crank handle. Han pottery tomb models of farmyards and gristmills possess the first known depictions of crank handles, which were used to operate the fans of winnowing machines. The machine was used to separate chaff from grain, but the Chinese of later dynasties also employed the crank handle for silk-reeling, hemp-spinning, flour-sifting, and drawing water from a well using the <b>windlass.</b> To measure distance traveled, the Han-era Chinese also created the odometer cart. This invention is depicted in Han artwork by the 2nd century CE, yet detailed written descriptions were not offered until the 3rd century CE. The wheels of this device rotated a set of gears which in turn forced mechanical figures to bang gongs and drums that alerted the travelers of the distance traveled (measured in li). From existing specimens found at archaeological sites, it is known that Han-era craftsmen made use of the sliding metal caliper to make minute measurements. Although Han-era calipers bear incised inscriptions of the exact day of the year they were manufactured, they are not mentioned in any Han literary sources.|$|E
5|$|The Baltimore Beltway {{was first}} planned in 1949 by Baltimore County; the state {{eventually}} {{took over the}} project and it {{became part of the}} Interstate Highway System planned in 1956. The length of the route from MD 2 south of Baltimore clockwise to U.S. Route 40 (US40) northeast of the city opened in stages from 1955 to 1962, providing an Interstate bypass of Baltimore. It was the first beltway in the United States to be built as part of the Interstate Highway System. Plans were made to finish the remainder of the route, with a diversion to the <b>Windlass</b> Freeway and the Patapsco Freeway, opened in 1973, following the cancellation of a more outer route that was to partly follow what is today MD702 (Southeast Boulevard). The Outer Harbor Crossing over the Patapsco River, which was dedicated to Francis Scott Key, who wrote The Star-Spangled Banner, and its approaches were finished in 1977, completing the route around Baltimore. The approaches to the bridge were originally two lanes to accommodate a tunnel that was originally proposed to run under the river; in subsequent years, they were upgraded to a four-lane configuration compliant with Interstate Highway standards, allowing for this portion of route to be signed as I-695 rather than MD695. There are future plans for I-695 that include high-occupancy toll lanes to ease traffic. In addition, the northeastern interchange with I-95 has been reconstructed to accommodate express toll lanes that were added to I-95 (completed in 2014, but construction is in progress in 2016 to remove I-695's carriageway crossovers here).|$|E
25|$|Grampus {{needed a}} <b>windlass</b> {{in order to}} work her gear, and the Fish Commission opted for a steam <b>windlass.</b> United States Navy Lieutenant Commander Zera Luther Tanner, an {{influential}} inventor and oceanographer of the era, commanding officer of the Fish Commissions fisheries research ship USFC Albatross, and previously the first commanding officer of Fish Hawk, received the task of determining what type of steam apparatus Grampus should carry. He chose a steam <b>windlass</b> with engines of 35-horsepower (26.1-kW). Operating the <b>windlass</b> required the installation of a boiler, steam pump, iron water tanks, and associated piping.|$|E

25|$|During {{sea trials}} in 1886, the steam <b>windlass</b> and its engines and boiler {{proved to be}} far too heavy and large for Grampus. The steam {{apparatus}} was removed and the steam <b>windlass</b> {{was replaced by a}} wooden one, making Grampus much easier to handle at sea.|$|E
25|$|At the bow area, the <b>windlass</b> {{and a large}} {{mound of}} chain remain.|$|E
25|$|By {{the spring}} of 1885, the United States Congress had {{appropriated}} $14,000 (USD) for the design and constriction of Grampus and design of the ship began. Grampus hull was constructed at Noank, Connecticut, by Robert Palmer & Sons, which launched her on 23 March 1886. Her sails, rigging, blocks, and ground tackle came from E. L. Rowe & Son, of Gloucester; her boats from Higgins & Gifford, of Gloucester; her steam <b>windlass</b> from the American Ship <b>Windlass</b> Company of Providence, Rhode Island; and the boiler for the <b>windlass</b> from M. V. B. Darling of Providence. The rest of her equipment came mainly from Bliss Brothers and H. M. Greenough of Boston, Massachusetts.|$|E
50|$|On the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, the lockkeepers were {{required}} to remove the <b>windlasses</b> from all lock paddles at night, to prevent unauthorized use. But {{they had to get}} up and man the lock if a boat came through at night.|$|R
50|$|While most <b>windlasses</b> require power, {{many are}} {{manually}} driven {{in the same}} manner as most sailing boats' winches for sheets. In fact only modern boats have practical sources for power, and ships in the old days have always required manual power.|$|R
5000|$|Ground tackle {{includes}} {{equipment such as}} mooring winches, <b>windlasses,</b> and anchors. Anchors {{are used}} to moor ships in shallow water. They {{are connected to the}} ship by a rope or chain. On larger vessels, the chain runs through a hawsepipe.|$|R

60|$|Suiting {{the action}} to the word, Jack gave forth, {{at the top}} of his voice, one or two of those peculiarly {{nautical}} howls wherewith seamen are wont to constrain <b>windlasses</b> and capstans to creak, and anchors to let go their hold.|$|R
60|$|Lawrence Pentfield and Corry Hutchinson were millionaires, {{though they}} did not look it. There seemed nothing unusual about them, while they would have passed muster as fair {{specimens}} of lumbermen in any Michigan camp. But outside, in the darkness, where holes yawned in the ground, were many men engaged in <b>windlassing</b> muck and gravel and gold from the bottoms of the holes where other men received fifteen dollars per day for scraping it from off the bedrock. Each day thousands of dollars' worth of gold were scraped from bedrock and <b>windlassed</b> to the surface, and it all belonged to Pentfield and Hutchinson, who took their rank among the richest kings of Bonanza.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{reference to}} a treadwheel in archival literature is in France about 1225, followed by an illuminated depiction in a manuscript of probably also French origin dating to 1240.
