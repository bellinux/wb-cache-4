We leverage the canonical form of the multilevel bipartite directed graph to formalize a unit-grid model that allows us to define and evalutate parameters such as total wire crossing, critical wire crossing, total wire length, critical wire length, critical wire density, total wire density, as well as height, width, and area of the embedded graph. We implemented a prototype placement algorithm TOCO that minimizes the cost of wire crossing, and a universal unit-grid based placement evaluator place eval. We have designed a number of statistical experiments to demonstrate the feasibility and the promise of the proposed approach...|$|E
40|$|Channel routing is a {{well-known}} NP-complete problem in VLSI design. The problem is to find routing paths {{among a group of}} terminals that satisfy a given connection requirement without overlapping each other. This problem can be regarded as a constraint satisfaction problem. For a HV channel where there is only one horizontal layer and one vertical layer, the problem can be described easily in finite-domain constraint logic programming languages. However, for a nHV channel where n ? 1, the modelization is not so straightforward because some entailment constraints are involved. We use delay to implement the entailment constraints. The resulting program is very simple, but demonstrates good performance that is comparable to that of previous programs. 1.

30|$|In Hunan province, each highway toll station must {{transfer}} the collected information on vehicles and roads to the Management Center located in Changsha city {{from time to}} time. The Management Center (MC) plays a role as centralized data center for highway information computing, storage, and monitoring. A toll station can {{transfer the}} traffic information by private highway fiber network or by VPN rented from China Telecom as a backup line. While in some areas, especially the mountainous areas, the <b>wired</b> <b>channel</b> to MC is very disruption prone due to disrepair and aging of lines. Toll stations would have to choose the wireless broadband service rented from China Mobile when the <b>wired</b> <b>channel</b> failed and toll stations were disconnected from the MC. But in these areas, all stations are not equipped with access points connecting RRHs, and those with access points may have a different wireless channel QoS due to the difference of distance, terrain, and devices. One of possible solutions under this condition is to select a toll station as a relay node, which should have the best wireless QoS compared to other stations nearby. The nearby stations could transfer the traffic information to the relay node by <b>wired</b> <b>channel</b> (providing the <b>wired</b> <b>channel</b> between them is working well) or by D 2 D communications. After that, the relay node would transfer the traffic information to MC by wireless broadband channel. Thus, it is desirable for the relay node to be dynamically configured to choose an optimal solution for reducing communication cost while subject to time constraints. The service provided by this relay node is the data service in this context. The relay node is a service provider who should take responsibilities of configuring and optimizing the data transferring procedure.|$|R
