5|$|Edward {{informed}} Baldwin that {{he would}} abdicate {{if he could not}} marry Simpson. Baldwin then presented Edward with three choices: give up the idea of marriage; marry against his ministers' wishes; or abdicate. It was clear that Edward <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to give up Simpson, and he knew that if he married against the advice of his ministers, he would cause the government to resign, prompting a constitutional crisis. He chose to abdicate.|$|E
5|$|Goebbels' efforts {{had little}} impact {{for the time}} being, as while Hitler was in {{principle}} in favour of total war, he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to implement changes {{over the objections of}} his ministers. The discovery around this time of a mass grave of Polish officers that had been killed by the Red Army in the 1940 Katyn massacre was made use of by Goebbels in his propaganda in an attempt to drive a wedge between the Soviets and the other western allies.|$|E
5|$|Henry II died in 1189 and was {{succeeded by}} Richard I. Rhys {{considered}} {{that he was}} no longer bound by the agreement with King Henry and attacked the Norman lordships surrounding his territory. He ravaged Pembroke, Haverfordwest, and Gower and captured the castles of St. Clear's, Laugharne, and Llansteffan. Richard's brother, Prince John (later King John), came to Wales in September and tried to make peace. He persuaded Rhys to raise the siege of Carmarthen and accompany him to Oxford to meet Richard. Rhys arrived at Oxford to discover that Richard <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to travel there to meet him, and hostilities continued.|$|E

5|$|In 1572, Sigismund II Augustus, {{the last}} {{king of the}} Jagiellonian dynasty, died without any heirs. The {{political}} system <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> for this eventuality, as there was no method of choosing a new king. After much debate {{it was determined that}} the entire nobility of Poland and Lithuania would decide who the king was to be. The nobility were to gather at Wola, near Warsaw, to vote in the royal election.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next few years, Bloom spent some £16,000 {{restoring}} the locomotive (along with some 20,000 man hours) and in May 1974 it was restored to steam once more. Unfortunately, as 1976 progressed it was discovered that No. 46233 would require a new firebox tubeplate at a projected cost of £12,000. Bloom <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to spend further money at this time and the engine became a static exhibit at Bressingham.|$|E
5|$|The Confirmatio Cartarum (Confirmation of Charters) {{was issued}} in Norman French by Edward I in 1297. Edward, needing money, had taxed the nobility, {{and they had}} armed {{themselves}} against him, forcing Edward to issue his confirmation of Magna Carta and the Forest Charter to avoid civil war. The nobles had sought to add another document, the De Tallagio, to Magna Carta. Edward I's government <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to concede this, they agreed to the issuing of the Confirmatio, confirming the previous charters and confirming the principle that taxation should be by consent, although the precise manner of that consent was not laid down.|$|E

5|$|The French 55th Infantry Division <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> {{for such}} an attack. French {{soldiers}} had commented on the massive psychological effect of the bombardment, in particular the siren of the Ju 87. However, after the war, {{it was discovered that}} none of the bunkers had been destroyed by direct hits. Moreover, just 56 French casualties were suffered. It was the indirect effect that did the damage. The telecommunication cables were destroyed (most had been laid out in the open) through bombing, paralysing the division's communications, and the psychological damage crippled its defensive capacity.|$|E
5|$|Although she {{had long}} broken her formal ties with the British Communist Party, Wilkinson {{retained}} strong links with other communist organisations at home and abroad. Her association with leading communists such as Willi Münzenberg and Otto Katz is revealed in British intelligence files held on her. However, she <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to risk losing her parliamentary seat, and thus kept her rebellious behaviour within bounds. In 1937 Wilkinson {{was one of a}} group of Labour figures—Aneurin Bevan, Harold Laski and Stafford Cripps were others—who founded the left-wing magazine Tribune; in the first issue she wrote of the need to fight unemployment, poverty, malnutrition and inadequate housing. Mindful of the dependence of many low-income families on credit, she introduced a bill to regulate hire purchase agreements, at the time a subject of frequent abuse, and with all-party support she secured the passage of the Hire Purchase Act 1938.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{majority}} of LMAs involve the outsourcing of one television station's operations to another, occasionally, a company may operate a station under an LMA, JSA or SSA {{even if it does}} not already own a station in that market. One example occurred in December 2013, when the Louisiana Media Company (owned by New Orleans Saints and New Orleans Hornets owner Tom Benson) entered into a shared services agreement with Raycom Media to run the former company's Fox affiliate in New Orleans, Louisiana, WVUE-DT; while Louisiana Media Company retained the station's ownership and license, other assets were assumed by Raycom, which owns stations in markets adjacent to New Orleans (including Baton Rouge, Jackson, Biloxi, Lake Charles and Shreveport) but not within New Orleans itself. Benson had received offers from Raycom and others to buy the station, but <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to sell WVUE outright.|$|E

5|$|Maha Chakkraphat, {{being unable}} to repel the Burmese, {{sent a message to}} his {{son-in-law}} Maha Thammaracha at Phitsanulok, ordering his vassal to come to his aid by bringing an army southwards towards Ayutthaya and if possible to engage the enemy in battle. Thammaracha quickly mobilized his forces {{and with the help of}} the Governor of Sawankhalok, marched southward with a large army to attack the Burmese rear. Upon hearing of this and on the advice of Bayinnaung; Tabinshwehti decided to withdraw, abandoning the mission altogether. His decision was compounded by news from Burma that the Mons, who had never been entirely subjugated by the Taungoo dynasty, rebelled in the absence of the king. Other factors included the scarcity of supplies and sickness in his army, which <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> for a long siege.|$|E
5|$|Neither paramountcy nor the {{subsidiary}} alliances {{could continue}} after Indian independence. The British took {{the view that}} {{because they had been}} established directly between the British crown and the princely states, they could not be transferred to the newly independent dominions of India and Pakistan. At the same time, the alliances imposed obligations on Britain that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to continue to carry out, such as the obligation to maintain troops in India for the defence of the princely states. The British government therefore decided that paramountcy, together with all treaties between them and the princely states, would come to an end upon the British departure from India.|$|E
5|$|The Barrier (later {{known as}} the Ross Ice Shelf) was sighted on 23 January, but the inlet had disappeared; the Barrier edge had changed {{significantly}} in the intervening years, and the section which had included the inlet had broken away to form a considerable bay, which Shackleton named the Bay of Whales after {{the large number of}} whales seen there. Shackleton <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to risk wintering on a Barrier surface that might calve into the sea, so he turned the ship towards King Edward VII Land. After repeated efforts to approach this coast had failed, and with rapidly moving ice threatening to trap the ship, Nimrod was forced to retreat. Shackleton's only choice now, other than abandonment of the expedition's goals, was to break the promise he had given to Scott. On 25 January he ordered the ship to head for McMurdo Sound.|$|E

5|$|The {{diplomatic}} context at Constance {{included the}} revolt of the Bohemian Hussites, who looked upon Poland {{as an ally}} in their wars against Sigismund, the emperor elect and new king of Bohemia. In 1421, the Bohemian Diet declared Sigismund deposed and formally offered the crown to Władysław on condition that he accept the religious principles of the Four Articles of Prague, which he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to do. After Władysław's refusal, Vytautas was postulated (elected in absentia) as Bohemian king, but he assured the pope that he opposed the heretics. Between 1422 and 1428, Władysław's nephew, Sigismund Korybut, attempted a regency in war-torn Bohemia, with little success. Vytautas accepted Sigismund's offer of a royal crown in 1429 — apparently with Władysław's blessing — but Polish forces intercepted the crown in transit and the coronation was cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately for Captain Segond, when dawn broke on 18 October, HMS Anson was {{revealed}} {{only a short}} distance off, limping southwards after the damage its rigging and masts had suffered before the battle on 12 October. Although his ship was almost unmanageable, Captain Durham <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to lose a second opportunity to engage, and slowly brought his vessel to bear on Loire, which was unable to escape. Accompanying Anson was Kangaroo, recovered from the damage of 16 October and ready for further action. At 10:30, Anson and Loire began firing on one another, neither able to effectively manoeuvre and both relying on firepower to overwhelm their opponent. Kangaroo closed on the unprotected stern of Loire, firing {{as she did so}} and repeatedly raking the immobile French ship. By 12:00 Loire had lost her mainmast and was leaking badly, forcing Segond to surrender. His ship was towed to port as the sixth prize of the campaign.|$|E
5|$|With {{his newly}} {{acquired}} flotillas, the Flanders Flotilla′s commander - Admiral Ludwig von Schröder - decided {{to launch a}} raid in the Dover Strait against the Dover Barrage {{as well as any}} Allied shipping that could be found in the Channel. Although the British had prohibited transports from being in the Channel at night in anticipation of a German raid, the Dover Barrage <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>prepared</b> to meet such an attack. Facing Schröder′s 23 boats, the Dover Barrage was guarded by only the old destroyer , the yacht Ombra, and the naval trawler H. E. Straud. The four divisions of drifters manning the barrage′s anti-submarine nets were armed with only a single rifle each for defence. In addition to the forces guarding the Barrage, there were six Tribal-class destroyers at Dover that could be called upon {{in the event of a}} raid as well as several units of Harwich Force dispersed at the Downs.|$|E
