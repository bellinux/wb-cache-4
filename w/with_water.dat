5|$|Hydrogen and {{fluorine}} {{combine to}} yield hydrogen fluoride, in which discrete molecules form clusters by hydrogen bonding, resembling water more than hydrogen chloride. It boils {{at a much}} higher temperature than heavier hydrogen halides and unlike them is fully miscible <b>with</b> <b>water.</b> Hydrogen fluoride readily hydrates on contact <b>with</b> <b>water</b> to form aqueous hydrogen fluoride, also known as hydrofluoric acid. Unlike the other hydrohalic acids, which are strong, hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid at low concentrations. However, it can attack glass, something the other acids cannot do.|$|E
5|$|Like many powders, {{dysprosium}} powder {{may present}} an explosion hazard when {{mixed with air}} and when an ignition source is present.

It can react <b>with</b> <b>water</b> to produce flammable hydrogen gas. Dysprosium chloride fires, however, can be extinguished <b>with</b> <b>water,</b> while dysprosium fluoride and dysprosium oxide are non-flammable. Dysprosium nitrate, Dy(NO3)3, is a strong oxidizing agent and will readily ignite on contact with organic substances.|$|E

5|$|Potassium is an {{extremely}} active metal that reacts violently with oxygen in water and air. With oxygen it forms potassium peroxide, and <b>with</b> <b>water</b> potassium forms potassium hydroxide. The reaction of potassium <b>with</b> <b>water</b> is dangerous because of its violent exothermic character {{and the production of}} hydrogen gas. Hydrogen reacts again with atmospheric oxygen, producing water, which reacts with the remaining potassium. This reaction requires only traces of water; because of this, potassium and the liquid sodium-potassium — NaK — are potent desiccants {{that can be used to}} dry solvents prior to distillation.|$|E

40|$|Over a {{two year}} period 100 infants with {{histories}} of wheeze were challenged <b>with</b> nebulised <b>water.</b> They were sedated and lung function measured by total body plethysmography.

After challenge <b>with</b> nebulised <b>water</b> and sodium cromoglycate there were significant decreases in specific conductance compared with those found after challenge with normal saline. After rechallenge <b>with</b> nebulised <b>water</b> there was no deterioration in lung function. Although sodium cromoglycate caused a deterioration in lung function in these infants, it protected their airways from challenge <b>with</b> nebulised <b>water...</b>|$|R

5|$|All the {{alkali metals}} are highly {{reactive}} and are never found in elemental forms in nature. Because of this, {{they are usually}} stored in mineral oil or kerosene (paraffin oil). They react aggressively with the halogens to form the alkali metal halides, which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all soluble in water except lithium fluoride (LiF). The alkali metals also react <b>with</b> <b>water</b> to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should be handled with great care. The heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter ones; for example, when dropped into water, caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium if {{the same number of}} moles of each metal is used. The alkali metals have the lowest first ionisation energies in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain a noble gas configuration by losing just one electron. Not only do the alkali metals react <b>with</b> <b>water,</b> but also with proton donors like alcohols and phenols, gaseous ammonia, and alkynes, the last demonstrating the phenomenal degree of their reactivity. Their great power as reducing agents makes them very useful in liberating other metals from their oxides or halides.|$|E
