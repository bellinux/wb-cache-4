25|$|Glaciations in East Africa are {{associated}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>colder,</b> drier climate when the precipitation is less, but the extra temperature drop means any solid precipitation stays.

5|$|September 2, 2006– The {{remnants}} of Hurricane John, an East Pacific storm, cause moderate to heavy rainfall. In northern Texas, {{moisture from the}} storm combined <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front produces rainfall of over , helping alleviate severe drought.|$|E
5|$|Sinatra <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> is Picasso without paint, Ferrari without fuel--only worse. For {{the common}} cold robs Sinatra of that uninsurable jewel, his voice, cutting into {{the core of his}} confidence, and it affects not only his own psyche but also seems to cause a kind of {{psychosomatic}} nasal drip within dozens of people who work for him, drink with him, love him, depend on him for their own welfare and stability. A Sinatra <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> can, in a small way, send vibrations through the entertainment industry and beyond as surely as a President of the United States, suddenly sick, can shake the national economy.|$|E
5|$|While Hazel {{caused the}} most {{damage in the}} Carolinas, the storm did not lose all of its intensity. Going north, Hazel turned extratropical by midday when it merged <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front; however, it {{retained}} hurricane-strength winds and it was continuing to drop heavy rainfall.|$|E

5|$|After {{crossing}} into Virginia, Jeanne transitioned into an extratropical cyclone by September 29 near Washington, D.C. In Wilmington, Delaware, {{the storm}} spawned an F2 tornado. Across the Mid-Atlantic and New England, {{moisture from the}} storm produced light to heavy rainfall, with totals of over 7inches (175mm) near Philadelphia and Nantucket. Subsequent to becoming extratropical, the remnants of Jeanne turned eastward, exited into the Atlantic Ocean, and merged <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front.|$|E
5|$|Further inland, {{moisture}} from Bonnie combined <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front to produce widespread thunderstorms over Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee. In Arkansas, lightning from a severe thunderstorm knocked out power {{to much of}} the city of Rison after striking a transformer. Significant wind damage took place in Dallas County where awnings were blown off homes, structures sustained roof damage, and trees were felled. Heavy rains also triggered localized flash flooding, covering several highways. Throughout the state, storm damage was estimated at $356,000 (2010USD).|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Paine {{contributed to}} one of the most {{significant}} flooding events in Oklahoma history. The 16th tropical storm and 8th hurricane of the 1986 Pacific hurricane season, Paine formed on September 28 off the southeast coast of Mexico. It moved around a ridge, later turning to the north and brushing the Baja California Peninsula. By that time, Paine had attained peak winds of 100mph (155km/h), but it weakened slightly before hitting the Mexican state of Sonora. The remnant moisture combined <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front to produce heavy rainfall in the south-central United States.|$|E

Rattray had a small role in the CBS soap opera Guiding Light as Wendy in 1988 and led a primetime career before and after her time on ATWT. The show's then-head writer Douglas Marland lured Byrne back to the role when Rattray announced her departure.|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Waldo was a Pacific {{hurricane}} {{that caused}} significant flooding in Kansas during October 1985. After developing into a tropical depression on October 7, it steadily intensified, becoming {{a tropical storm}} within a day. Waldo reached hurricane intensity on October 8. After peaking as a moderate Category 2 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale, it re-curved to the east, making landfall at peak intensity near Culiacán. Afterward, it rapidly dissipated. In all, Waldo caused moderate damage in Sonora. The remnants of the storm combined <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front over the Great Plains. Significant flooding and one death was recorded in Kansas. Many rivers and creeks overflowed its banks.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the {{granular}} pavement {{section of}} Highway 2 south of Watrous was tested <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> in-place recycling or “CIR” method to rehabilitate highways. This CIR {{process is a}} cost-effective method which recycles the top surface of a road. This pulverized material is mixed with asphalt emulsion and spread and compacted back onto the highway surface. This surface is then recovered with a new seal dependent on traffic volume.|$|E
5|$|Its {{associated}} thunderstorm {{activity was}} sporadic and relatively disorganized, and the storm weakened to a tropical depression on July16. Claudette briefly re-intensified into {{a tropical storm}} before becoming extratropical later that day. Shortly thereafter, it merged <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front, while the remnants were last noted near the Azores on July23. Tropical Storm Claudette had minimal effects on land. Severe rip currents from Claudette in North Carolina caused several rescues and one person was injured, although no fatalities occurred. Some residents of coastal North Carolina were even disappointed that Claudette was to remain offshore, as the region was suffering from dry conditions.|$|E

She finished eighth in the sprint, in which she crashed on a downhill slope, and came in eleventh in the pursuit race. She was not appointed for the individual race and could not start in the mixed relay due to her cold. On 21 February 2009, Neuner claimed silver as part Germany's women's relay team, alongside Martina Beck, Andrea Henkel and Kati Wilhelm. On {{the last day of the}} championships, she came in seventh in the mass start race.|$|E
5|$|On March 26, 1841, William Henry Harrison {{became ill}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold.</b> According to the {{prevailing}} medical misconception of that time, {{it was believed that}} his illness was directly caused by the bad weather at his inauguration; however, Harrison's illness did not arise until more than three weeks after the event. The cold worsened, rapidly turning to pneumonia and pleurisy. He sought to rest in the White House, but could not find a quiet room because of the steady crowd of office seekers. His extremely busy social schedule made any rest time scarce.|$|E
5|$|On October8, the {{remnants}} of Laura reached the Netherlands. At the time, its rain bands began interacting <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> front associated with a well-developed low west of Norway, dropping up to 113mm (4.4in) of precipitation in the northwestern Netherlands. Consequently, streets and homes {{in the village of}} Hippolytushoef were reportedly inundated. The large amounts of precipitation broke the daily and monthly rainfall records for October, which were previously set in 2006. Gradually passing through Norway, {{the remnants}} of the storm caused significant damage to electric utilities. As a result, more than 10,000 people lost power in southern parts of the country.|$|E

5|$|The 2nd Army's command {{structure}} fell apart as Bagration was evacuated {{from the battlefield}} and the report of him being hit quickly spread and caused morale collapse. Napoleon, who had been sick <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> and was {{too far from the}} action to really observe what was going on, refused to send his subordinates reinforcements. He was hesitant to release his last reserve, the Imperial Guard, so far from France.|$|E
5|$|The bath complex {{featured}} {{an entrance}} room (vestibulum), an exercise hall (basilica thermarum), a sweating room (sudatorium), a cold room <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> pool (frigidarium), a warm room (tepidarium), {{and a hot}} room with a hot plunge bath (caldarium). An unsheltered exercise yard (palaestra) also formed part of the complex. The baths had mosaic floors and were heated by a hypocaust under-floor system connected to three furnaces. Such furnaces required several metric tons of wood each day.|$|E
5|$|The system {{originated}} {{out of an}} upper-level low {{just west}} of the Canary Islands on September28. The low organized itself over the next days, producing several bursts of convection. While remaining non-tropical <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cold</b> core it moved gradually west to northwest. On October3, it became a broad surface low about 400 nautical miles (460mi, 740km) southwest of São Miguel Island in the Azores. Early on October4, convection increased as the surface low organized itself, and the system became a subtropical depression.|$|E
