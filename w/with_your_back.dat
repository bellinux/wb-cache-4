Rocket was being driven by Joseph Locke, George Stephenson's assistant and future eminent engineer in his own rights. A shout went up, [...] "An engine is approaching. Take care, gentlemen!" [...] The other disembarked passengers either climbed back into their seats, or stepped over the northern line and {{completely out of the}} way. A third option was available, to stand <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>back</b> to the stationary coaches, as there was a four-foot gap between the lines, and even though the Duke's private carriage was wider that then standard carriage, it would have still been possible to stand between the stationary and the travelling train and remain safe. However, what unfolded was a calamitous series of events. Huskisson was known to be clumsy. He had endured a long list of problems from his regular trips and falls, and he had twice broken his arm and never fully recovered the use of it. Add to this, that he was only a few weeks post surgery and was there against his doctor's advice.|$|E

50|$|In Blåkulla, people partied {{as if at}} a wedding; they drank, ate, {{danced and}} had sex {{by the light of}} candles that were placed in vaginas while Satan sat under the table and laughed so that the whole room shook and the fire of hell poured up from a hole in the floor, where you could see the tormented souls in hell. You danced <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>backs</b> towards each other, as well as doing {{everything}} else backwards, married several people at the same time, and had sex with them and with Satan himself, and with his devils and demons, whose penises were cold and whose sperm was made of water and gave birth to frogs that were swept up from the floor with a broom and were made into butter. When you woke up afterwards, your body ached, the food you had eaten had vanished and made you hungry and the gifts you had received had turned to wood chip.|$|R

5000|$|In {{spite of}} all that has {{happened}} and what still may happen, the primary issue in the heart and mind of every person in our Arab Islamic nation is the restoration of legitimate rights in Palestine, Syria and Lebanon.... We believe in taking up arms in self-defence and to deter aggression. But we also believe in peace when {{it is based on}} justice and equity, and when it brings an end to conflict. Only within the context of true peace can normal relations flourish between the people of the region and allow the region to pursue development rather than war. In light of the above, and <b>with</b> <b>your</b> <b>backing</b> and that of the Almighty, I propose that the Arab summit put forward a clear and unanimous initiative addressed to the United Nations security council based on two basic issues: normal relations and security for Israel in exchange for full withdrawal from all occupied Arab territories, recognition of an independent Palestinian state with al-Quds al-Sharif as its capital, and the return of refugees.|$|R

60|$|It was a rainy afternoon, and we {{had been}} passing the time by telling ghost stories.

You then duck your head down, throw your heels up, turn round on your back, and let go with your hands, all at the same moment.
