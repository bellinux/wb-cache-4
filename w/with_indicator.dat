5|$|The LS 400 {{was among}} the first luxury sedans to feature an {{automatic}} tilt-and-telescoping steering wheel with SRS airbag, power adjustable shoulder seat belts, and an electrochromic rear-view mirror. The five-passenger cabin included California walnut and leather trim, power-adjustable seats, and soft-touch controls. A back-lit electro-luminescent gauge cluster featured a holographic visual effect, <b>with</b> <b>indicator</b> lights projected onto the instrument panel. The memory system stored the driver's seat, side mirror, steering wheel, and seat belt positions. Available luxury options included a Nakamichi premium sound system and an integrated cellular telephone with hands-free capabilities. The LS 400 further contained some 300 technological innovations to aid smooth operation and silence, including fluid-damped cabin fixtures, vibration-insulating rubber mounts, airflow fairings, and sandwich steel body panels.|$|E
25|$|One of the Bizon's {{more unusual}} {{features}} is the magazine, {{which is often}} mistaken for a grenade launcher. The cylinder below the barrel {{is in fact a}} 64-round helical-feed magazine, similar to the type used in the American Calico M960 submachine gun. The magazine is made from a durable glass-reinforced polyamide and mounts under the handguard in line with the barrel. This layout makes the weapon more compact and concealable. All cartridges are aligned nose forward in the Bizon magazine and cannot be loaded incorrectly. Early magazines were fabricated from aluminium tubing and had a capacity of 67 rounds. The production magazine capacity of 64 was selected as 64 is a multiple of 16, and 9×18mm Makarov rounds are packaged in boxes of 16. The magazine has hooks on top of the front end that engage a pair of pins under the front sight, and the rear end of the magazine interfaces with a Kalashnikov pattern spring-loaded paddle type magazine catch/release located in front of the trigger guard. Some magazines were produced <b>with</b> <b>indicator</b> holes allowing the user to verify the amount of ammunition loaded; these are spaced at 4, 24, 44 and 64-round increments.|$|E

40|$|Forty-four {{patients}} with allergic (ABA) and non-allergic (NABA) variants of bronchial asthma (BA) were examined to evaluate levels of key adipokines (leptin, resistin, adiponectin) in sputum in different variants of BA. Adipokines in sputum and blood plasma were measured by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The indices {{that reflect the}} percentage of adipokines in sputum regarding adipokines in plasma of the same patients were worked out to evaluate the ratio of levels of corresponding adipokines in plasma and sputum in {{patients with}} BA. Two regularities are clearly seen in the study: the first - levels of proinflammatory adipokines (leptin, resistin) in sputum in ABA correlate directly <b>with</b> <b>indicators</b> of respiratory function but levels of anti-inflammatory adipokines (adiponectin) in sputum correlate inversely <b>with</b> <b>indicators</b> of respiratory function; the second -correlation of levels of the studied adipokines <b>with</b> <b>indicators</b> of respiratory function are almost not revealed in NABA. The first regularity reflects the important fact that the content of adipokines in bronchial secretion is {{to a certain extent}} one of regulating local mechanisms in target organ controlled system levels of corresponding adipokines in exacerbation of BA...|$|R

50|$|It {{was little}} publicized {{that there were}} two {{versions}} of the Model 30, known (on the rare occasions when they were distinguished at all) as the 30-1 and the 30-2. The original 30-1 had a 2.0 microsecond storage cycle. Later, after the first 1000 30-1 were shipped, it was replaced by the 1.5-microsecond 30-2, although the 30-1 was silently retained in the sales catalog. The two were cosmetically different; the 30-1 looked like other System/360 models, <b>with</b> <b>indicator</b> lamps exposed on the front panel and labeled, but the 30-2 took a retrograde design step, putting the lights behind a stencil, as they had been on pre-360 machines like the IBM 1401.|$|E

A total of 155,850 cars were hand built over the period, including 27 thousand original Volgas with the ZMZ-4022 engines.|$|E

40|$|Different frailty {{definitions}} {{are suitable}} for different purposes. When investigating its key multidimensional predictors and effects, narrower definitions of frailty that exclude these elements may be more desirable. For this purpose, candidate physical frailty specifications are constructed and then evaluated on their construct and concurrent validity. For 4638 participants aged 65 to 89 years from wave 2 (2004) of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, confirmatory factor analysis is performed to create physical frailty specifications <b>with</b> four <b>indicators</b> (slowness, weakness, exhaustion, and weight loss) and <b>with</b> three <b>indicators</b> (slowness, weakness, and either exhaustion or weight loss). Using derived factor scores, their convergent, discriminant, and concurrent validity are compared. For specifications <b>with</b> four <b>indicators</b> and <b>with</b> three <b>indicators</b> including exhaustion, slowness contributes dominantly to the physical frailty factor. However, <b>with</b> three <b>indicators</b> including weight loss, weakness contributes most. Where represented, weight loss only contributes minimally. Higher factor scores are significantly associated with chronic diseases, functional impairment, and poor self-rated health, although less so for the third specification. Factor scores {{for the first two}} specifications have low correlation with psychological and social frailty while those for the third have negligible correlation. Factor scores increase with higher Frailty Index although again less so for the third specification. Minor differences are seen across gender. On account of their convergent, discriminatory, and concurrent validity, physical frailty specifications <b>with</b> four <b>indicators</b> and <b>with</b> three <b>indicators</b> including exhaustion hold promise for use in investigation of frailty pathways involving multidimensional predictors and effects...|$|R

Seeds are banked in hermetically sealed glass containers along with Silica gel packets impregnated <b>with</b> <b>indicator</b> compounds that change colour if moisture seeps into the collection. Seeds are tested for viability with a germination test shortly after banking and then at regular 10 year intervals. If seed collections are low, re-harvesting from the wild is always the preferred option.|$|E

There were {{complaints}} about {{conditions on board}} Empire Orwell when she was returning troops from the Far East to the United Kingdom in 1958.

Complaints that soldiers below the rank of sergeant were generally unable to visit their families were stated to be a matter of military discipline.
