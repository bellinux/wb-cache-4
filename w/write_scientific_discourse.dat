Questionnaires and interviews were used to collect data from students. An interview was also conducted with one key science lecturer. The questionnaire and interview responses were analysed using the framework of four features of scientific academic writing - Generic Structure, Content, Surface Level Features and Access. The students' questionnaire and interview responses provided insights about their perceptions of the differences between writing at school and at university and also about the difficulties they experienced with learning to <b>write</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>discourse.</b> The students came to realise during the semester that they were not adequately prepared to cope with writing across the range of scientific genres or with the more sophisticated level of contextual knowledge required in their university studies. The interview with the science lecturer revealed a gap between the students' and the lecturer's perceptions that may be a factor in the problematic nature of learning to <b>write</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>discourse</b> at university. While the students did not appear to consider the language of science relevant to their contextual knowledge, the lecturer indicated that he perceived the language of science to be intrinsically bound with a command of the content. The students also indicated that the lecturer's expectations about discourse requirements were not sufficiently explicit. The lecturer, on the other hand, indicated that explicit instructions about discourse requirements were provided for students. This study signals the need for closer collaboration between Communication Skills lecturers and science subject lecturers in bringing the perceptions of the students and the lecturers closer together. The Communication Skills lecturer can assist students to learn the required scientific discourse by working alongside science subject lecturers to collaboratively provide in-context, explicit instruction, scaffolding and modelling of specific written tasks.

40|$|The present article {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the definitions of emotivity and expressiveness from the viewpoint of the various branches of linguistics. Emotivity and expressiveness are claimed to be the key concepts of a new branch of linguistics called text emotivity, for they render emotions of the author into the text. The article pays specific attention to emotivity of <b>scientific</b> <b>discourse.</b> Two types of <b>written</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>discourse</b> are characterized in the article regarding their lexical, grammatical, stylistic and iconographic differences. It has been demonstrated that emotivity spectrum and the way it is expressed in the <b>written</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>discourse</b> depends on its type. Emotive potential of <b>written</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>discourse</b> is often conveyed by lexical linguistic devices such as adjectives with highly positive evaluations. Such devices influence emotivity of the whole text, and reflect the author's pragmatic intentions as well as his or her emotions...|$|R

40|$|Do {{we need to}} {{standardize}} <b>written</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>discourse?</b> Almost ten years ago we wrote that academicians had been debating about the exact place of English for Specific Purposes (ESP) and English for Academic Purposes (EAP) –and similarly, Languages for Specific Purposes (LSP) and Languages for Academic Purposes (LAP) –, {{and whether or not}} ESP was valued on a par in higher education vis-à-vis EAP and vice versa. Some linguists tended to reject this parity on the grounds that one devalues the other. Our proposal, at that time, was that we "concentrate on what can be developed in common to contribute positively to the debate " (Piqué et al., 1996 : 6). LSP is sufficiently diversified, as Kachru (1988 : 9) wrote, to cover three basic assumptions: […] appropriateness of language corpus; format organization of the corpus at various linguistic levels; phonetic, phonological, lexical, syntactic, and discoursal; and the relationship between the formal features and the functions of the texts in terms of the profession, participants, and so on. And Alcaraz (2003 : 5), in his prologue to Rosario Bueno's bibliographical study, wrote...|$|R

40|$|That the English {{language}} is the prevailing language in international <b>scientific</b> <b>discourse</b> is an undeniable fact for research professionals who are non-native speakers of English (NNSE). An exploratory, survey-based study of {{scientists in the}} experimental disciplines of neuroscience and medicine seeks to reveal, on the one hand, the habits of scientists who in their research practice come across neologisms in English and need to use them in oral and <b>written</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>discourse</b> in their own languages, and, on the other hand, their attitudes towards these neologisms and towards English as the language of international science. We found that all scientists write and publish their research articles (RAs) in English and most submit them unrevised by native speakers of English. When first encountering a neologism in English, scientists tend {{to pay close attention}} to these new concepts, ideas or terms and very early in the reception process attempt to coin acceptable, natural-sounding Spanish equivalents for use in the laboratory and in their Spanish texts. In conjunction with the naturalized Spanish term, they often use the English neologism verbatim in a coexistent bilingual form, but they avoid using only the English term and very literal translations. These behaviors show an ambivalent attitude towards English (the language of both new knowledge reception and dissemination of their RAs) and Spanish (used for local professional purposes and for popularization) : while accepting to write in their acquired non-native language, they simultaneously recognize that their native language needs to preserve its specificity as a language of science...|$|R
30|$|Chapter four, “Language and Learning in the Primary School”, {{explores the}} {{learning}} process from four perspectives: initial literacy, style and registers in the primary school, the beginnings of <b>scientific</b> <b>discourse,</b> spoken and <b>written</b> language in education. When children begin their school education, they have to call up experiences stored previously, to help them learn to read and write. There {{is much more to}} children’s writing ability than just writing a narrative. Children should also learn to write other types of <b>writing</b> including <b>scientific</b> <b>discourse,</b> for they learn, not just scientific knowledge, but also the language in which knowledge is presented. In the process, children gradually become aware of the differences between spoken language and written language, i.e. the grammatical intricacy of the spoken language vs. the lexical density of the written language. Specifically how subject-oriented learning takes place is further explored in the next chapter.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{makes use}} of three commonly used qualitative methods, visual ethnography, rephotography and a type of photo-elicitation, to examine an innovative theory of visual knowledge called Know, Believe, and Imagine. KBI {{is first and foremost}} an innovative model of visual perception. The discovery of KBI led to an award-winning art practice. This study moves the theoretical foundations of KBI from the studio to a qualitative research setting to determine if KBI can be used for reliable and valid knowledge production. The invention of the printing press and the resulting mass production of literature in the fifteenth century presaged an immediate institutional commitment to verbal literacy, as embodied in the field of Library and Information Studies (LIS). However, despite the invention of technologies that have enabled the mass production of both still and moving images, a parallel institutional commitment to visual literacy in the social sciences has not transpired. The twenty-first century is awash in visual imagery due in no small measure to the computer, the Internet, and graphical user interfaces and remediation associated with computerization. Visual literacy refers to a group of vision competencies, integrated with other sensory modes, which are used to make sense of visual experience. Epistemological discourse regarding knowledge claims from visual records has tended to mimic the reductive paradigms applied to <b>written</b> <b>scientific</b> <b>discourse,</b> even though it has long been accepted that visual information is cognitively processed differently than verbal information. The examination of documentary photographs described in this dissertation examines a theory of seeing that emerged from art practice, and form the foundation for a discursive system that accounts for the role that existing knowledge, heuristics, and imagination performs in visual literacy. This study demonstrates that a knowledge-based approach, associated with research in cognitive psychology, is better suited for advancing visual literacy and visual epistemologies. Documentary photographs were examined in two phases using qualitative methods that provided evidence of the robustness of the theoretical model for meaningful social <b>scientific</b> <b>discourse.</b> The specific type of documentary photographs used for this research was black-and-white postcards created {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century. While sufficient time has elapsed to provide significant socio-cultural movement, not so much time has elapsed to render the artifactual material obsolete, allowing for the construction of rich socio-cultural narratives grounded in the trace evidence of still images. A pragmatic benefit of this research might include an increased valuation and access to visual archives, and improved methods for making sense of visual experience...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Romantic era {{was a time}} of {{tremendous}} change in the relationship between literary creation and scientific knowledge. Scientists framed a specific language and distinctive methods as they moved away from natural philosophy, which had thus far combined physics with metaphysics and united the observation of nature with its celebration. While William Wordsworth stated that « we murder to dissect », thus declaring the secession of poetic <b>writing</b> from <b>scientific</b> <b>discourse,</b> Percy Bysshe Shelley (1792 - 1822) was steadily studying science at Eton and then at Oxford, before embarking on a medical training at Saint Bartholomew’s Hospital in London. This thesis explores the poetic transfiguration of the scientific theories and concepts that Shelley came across in his readings and during his studies. It focuses on the way science is subverted by the poet’s imagination, as scientific representations undergo a fruitful metamorphosis, and become part of the webs of metaphors woven by the text according to its own laws. Shelley recreates the mythical and imaginary foundations as well as the ethical and metaphysical implications which lie dormant in the scientific writings he looks into. This study examines the encounter of two heuristic endeavours, of two highly formalised ways of writing. Science and poetry are in search of the hidden harmonies which underlie appearances. Measuring the measureless, encompassing absolute beauty within poetic metrics, subsuming the infinite richness of the natural world within the rules of mathematical calculation, such are the parallel endeavours of Shelley’s poetry and the science of his age...|$|R
