5|$|In ancient Egypt, cattle <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> livestock, and sheep, goats, {{and pigs}} were also kept; poultry {{including}} ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and bred on farms, {{where they were}} force-fed with dough to fatten them. The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish. Honey bees were domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, providing both honey and wax.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, raisin exports <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> {{export of}} the islands during the Venetian rule. By the early 18th century Zante, Cephalonia, and part of Ithaca had become a major centre of the currant trade. Because of the fierce {{competition}} in the raisin trade between Venice and the United Kingdom, Venice prohibited the free export of raisins from the islands. Another measure was the , a heavy export tax for foreign ships.|$|E

5|$|During British rule, a Governor was {{the chief}} {{administrative}} and political officer of Bombay. The executive Government of the Presidency was administered by the Governor. He had the same power and right in the Presidency as the Governor-General of India, and observed the same order and course in their proceedings. Governors of Bombay and Madras Presidencies, who were appointed by the British Crown, <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> officials after the Viceroy. Bombay Castle was the official residence of the Governor of Bombay until the 1770s, when it was moved to Parel; a century later, in 1883, it was moved to Malabar Hill.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, choral {{associations}} became common in Maryland, and Baltimore, {{buoyed by the}} immigration of numerous Germans. These groups were formed {{for the purpose of}} instruction in choral music, eventually performing oratorios. The popularity of these choral associations helped to garner support among the local population for putting music education in the city's public schools. The Baltimore Oratorio Society, the Liederkranz and the Germania Männerchor <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> of these associations, and their traditions were maintained into the 20th century by organizations like the Bach Choir, Choral Arts Society, Concert Artists of Baltimore, Handel Society and the Baltimore Symphony Chorus.|$|E
5|$|The attacks {{also caused}} {{extensive}} damage to Japan's urban areas. Approximately 40percent {{of the urban}} area of the 66 cities subjected to area attacks were destroyed. This included the loss of about 2.5million housing units, which rendered 8.5million people homeless. The urban area attacks reduced {{the morale of the}} Japanese population, and postwar surveys conducted by the USSBS found that air attacks <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> factor in convincing the Japanese that the war had been lost. During the final months of the war the raids also contributed to the deterioration of the Japanese social fabric. However, civilian morale did not collapse due to the bombing, and post-war investigations found that most Japanese had remained willing to continue the war if necessary.|$|E

5|$|Land {{ownership}} was important. Most of {{the growers}} were tenant farmers and {{were given the}} right of part ownership of the land over time. Tax policies encouraging needed produce made distinctions between land use to determine tax levies. For example, the daily market availability of rose petals was important for perfumers, so cultivation of roses received a lower tax assessment. Salt production and the manufacture of salt pans were controlled by similar means. The making of ghee (clarified butter), which was sold as an oil for human consumption and as a fuel for lighting lamps, was profitable. Exports to China intensified and included cotton, spices, jewels, semi-precious stones, ivory, rhino horn, ebony, amber, coral, and aromatic products such as perfumes. Large vessels from China made frequent visits, some captained by the Chinese Admiral Zheng He, and brought Chinese products to the empire's 300 ports, large and small, on the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. The ports of Mangalore, Honavar, Bhatkal, Barkur, Cochin, Cannanore, Machilipatnam, and Dharmadam <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Early Netherlandish masters' {{influence}} reached {{artists such}} as Stefan Lochner and the painter known as the Master of the Life of the Virgin, both of whom, working in mid-15th-century Cologne, drew inspiration from imported works by van der Weyden and Bouts. New and distinctive painterly cultures sprang up; Ulm, Nuremberg, Vienna and Munich <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> artistic centres in the Holy Roman Empire {{at the start of}} the 16th century. There was a rise in demand for printmaking (using woodcuts or copperplate engraving) and other innovations borrowed from France and southern Italy. Some 16th-century painters borrowed heavily from the previous century's techniques and styles. Even progressive {{artists such as}} Jan Gossaert made copies, such as his reworking of van Eyck's Madonna in the Church. Gerard David linked the styles of Bruges and Antwerp, often travelling between the cities. He moved to Antwerp in 1505, when Quentin Matsys was the head of the local painters' guild, and the two became friends.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians {{believed}} that a balanced relationship between people and animals was {{an essential element of}} the cosmic order; thus humans, animals and plants were believed to be members of a single whole. Animals, both domesticated and wild, were therefore a critical source of spirituality, companionship, and sustenance to the ancient Egyptians. Cattle <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> livestock; the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular censuses, and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them. In addition to cattle, the ancient Egyptians kept sheep, goats, and pigs. Poultry, such as ducks, geese, and pigeons, were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them. The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish. Bees were also domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, and provided both honey and wax.|$|E

5|$|The diet {{of adult}} American {{alligators}} from central Florida lakes {{was dominated by}} fish, highly opportunistically based upon local availability. In Lake Griffin, fish made up 54% of the diet by weight, with catfish being most commonly consumed while in Lake Apopka, fish made up 90% {{of the food and}} mostly shad were taken and in Lake Woodruff the diet was 84% fish and largely consists of bass and sunfish. Unusually in these regions, reptiles and amphibians <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> non-piscivore prey, mostly comprised by turtles and water snakes. In southern Louisiana, crustaceans (largely crayfish and crabs) were found to be present in the southeastern American alligators but largely absent in the southwestern American alligator which consumed a relatively high proportion of reptiles, although fish were the most recorded prey for adult American alligators and adult males consumed a large portion of mammals. In East Texas, diets were diverse and adult American alligators took mammals, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates (i.e. snails) in often equal measure as they did fish.|$|E
5|$|The early Middle Ages were {{a period}} of climate deterioration, {{resulting}} in more land becoming unproductive. Self-sufficient farms were based around a single homestead or a small cluster of homes. More oats and barley were grown than corn, and cattle <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> domesticated animal. From c. 1150 to 1300, warm dry summers and less severe winters allowed cultivation at greater heights and made land more productive. The system of infield and outfield agriculture may have been introduced with feudalism from the twelfth century. By the late Medieval period, most farming {{was based on the}} Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile. These were settlements of a handful of families that jointly farmed an area notionally suitable for two or three plough teams, organised in run rigs. Most ploughing was done with a heavy wooden plough with an iron coulter, pulled by oxen. The rural economy boomed in the thirteenth century and {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the Black Death was still buoyant, but by the 1360s there was a severe falling off in incomes to be followed by a slow recovery in the fifteenth century.|$|E
5|$|When {{the news}} of the fall of the Junta of Seville arrived, the group headed by Castelli and Belgrano led the process leading to the May Revolution. Castelli and Saavedra <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> leaders of the time, and first {{discarded}} Martín Rodríguez's plan to expel Cisneros in a coup d'état. After several discussions, they decided to request an open cabildo, an emergency popular assembly. Castelli and Belgrano negotiated with the senior alcalde and nobleman, Juan de Lezica, and the procurator, Julián de Leiva. Although they convinced them, they still needed the permission of Cisneros himself, for which Castelli and Rodriguez went to his office at the Fort of Buenos Aires. Previously, Cornelio Saavedra had denied Cisneros the support of the Regiment of Patricians, on the premise that with the disappearance of the Junta of Seville—who had appointed him as viceroy—he no longer had the right to hold that position.|$|E
