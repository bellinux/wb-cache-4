5|$|Chadwick's Clerk-Maxwell studentship {{expired in}} 1923, {{and he was}} succeeded by the Russian {{physicist}} Pyotr Kapitza. The Chairman of the Advisory Council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Sir William McCormick arranged for Chadwick to become Rutherford's assistant director of research. In this role, Chadwick helped Rutherford select PhD students. Over {{the next few years}} these would include John Cockcroft, Norman Feather and Mark Oliphant, who would become firm friends with Chadwick. As many students had no idea <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> research, Rutherford and Chadwick would suggest topics. Chadwick edited all the papers produced by the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Mao Zedong's People's Liberation Army {{defeated}} Chiang Kai-shek's United States-backed Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalist Government in China, and the Soviet Union promptly {{created an}} alliance with the newly formed People's Republic of China. According to Norwegian historian Odd Arne Westad, the communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek made, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China. Moreover, his party was weakened during the war against Japan. Meanwhile, the communists told different groups, such as the peasants, exactly <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hear, and they cloaked themselves {{under the cover of}} Chinese nationalism.|$|E
5|$|Shearer co-created, co-wrote and co-starred in Rob Reiner's 1984 film This Is Spinal Tap. Shearer, Reiner, Michael McKean and Christopher Guest {{received}} {{a deal to}} write a first draft of a screenplay for a company called Marble Arch. They decided that the film could not be written and instead filmed a 20-minute demo of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do. It was eventually greenlighted by Norman Lear and Jerry Perenchio at Embassy Pictures. The film satirizes the wild personal behavior and musical pretensions of hard rock and heavy metal bands, {{as well as the}} hagiographic tendencies of rockumentaries of the time. The three core members of the band Spinal Tap—David St. Hubbins, Derek Smalls and Nigel Tufnel—were portrayed by McKean, Shearer and Guest respectively. The three actors play their musical instruments and speak with mock English accents throughout the film. There was no script, although there was a written breakdown of most of the scenes, and many of the lines were ad-libbed. It was filmed in 25 days.|$|E
5000|$|A key {{component}} of the HighScope approach is the plan-do-review sequence. Children first plan <b>what</b> materials <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> work with, <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do, and whom <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do it with (this can be done formally or informally in small groups). Once {{they have made a}} plan, however vague, of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do, <b>they</b> can go and do it. Then, after this chosen worktime, the children discuss <b>what</b> <b>they</b> did and whether it was the same as, or different from, <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had planned.|$|R

5|$|Thirty Seconds to Mars {{retreated to}} the {{isolation}} of Wyoming's countryside in 2001 to record their debut album, working with Bob Ezrin and Brian Virtue. They contacted Ezrin because they {{grew up listening to}} his work with Pink Floyd, Kiss and Alice Cooper and they felt {{he was the only one}} who could help them capture the size and scope of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> accomplish on their debut recording. The band chose an empty warehouse lot on 15,000 acres, striving for the precise location that would enhance their sound. Even before the album was released, Puddle of Mudd invited Thirty Seconds to Mars to open a six-week tour for them in the spring of 2002. The band later embarked on a North American tour to support Incubus and began a club tour in August.|$|E
5|$|For Invasion of the Vorticons, John Carmack and Romero focused {{exclusively}} on the programming, while Adrian Carmack joined late in development and had a personal art style that did not match with the game. As a result, the game was largely shaped by designer Tom Hall's personal experiences and interests. Keen's red sneakers and Green Bay Packers football helmet were items Hall wore as a child, dead enemies left behind corpses due to his belief that child players should be taught that death had permanent consequences, and enemies were based loosely on his reading of Sigmund Freud's psychological theories, {{such as that of}} the id. For Keen Dreams, the team reprised their roles, and used the game as a prototype for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> change for the next Keen games for Apogee: an increase in graphical quality with parallax scrolling to make the background move at a different speed than the foreground, a pseudo-3D view rather than a side-on view, ramps rather than solely flat surfaces, support for sound cards, and changes to the design based on player feedback. The game's plot, as a result, was designed to be a standalone game outside of the continuity of the main series, and not a true sequel.|$|E

25|$|For {{much of its}} history, {{the bulk}} of NetSpan/Telemundo's children's {{programming}} has been derived of mainly live-action and animated programming from American and international producers, with most consisting of dubbed versions of series natively produced in English. In September 1995, Telemundo launched a Saturday morning program block, Telemundo Infantil ("Telemundo Kids"), which was developed via input from viewers on <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be featured in a children's show.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the album's creation each Weezer member asked themselves <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get out of the album. With that in mind, they set out to record. Recording was done in three sessions. Half of the album was recorded during the spring of 2007 with Rick Rubin overseeing production. The second session, started in July and finished on October 18, was produced by Weezer themselves at Malibu. The third and final session of recording was done at the request of Geffen Records, who claimed that there was not enough commercial material on the album. This session was produced by Jacknife Lee and completed in March 2008.|$|E
25|$|The monsters of {{the week}} in the series, Ghosts are twisted aberrations born from the regrets or {{suffering}} {{of people who have}} died and become lost in limbo. Panty and Stocking are tasked with their destruction, which allows them to pass on to Heaven, leaving behind Heaven Coins. Although most Ghosts are savage or destructive, some are relatively harmless annoyances or even oppose their true nature and try to live peacefully. Ghosts are usually slain with angelic weapons, but there are other means of destroying them, such as Ghosts killing each other or peacefully accomplishing <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> achieve in life. As a recurring joke, whenever Panty and Stocking defeat a Ghost with their angelic weapons, a paper-mache model of the Ghost is filmed being blown-up.|$|E

25|$|Florence Hawley (September 17, 1906-1991) {{was one of}} {{the first}} anthropologists to work {{extensively}} on dendrochronology, or tree-ring dating. She conducted archaeological and ethnographic research in the Southwestern United States; and undertook some of the first dendrochronological research in eastern North America in the mid 20th century, examining samples from a number of archaeological sites. She was also highly regarded as a passionate teacher who pushed her students toward greatness by encouraging them to think for themselves and work hard for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> achieve. Although faced with many challenges in her career, and discriminated against for being a woman, she persevered in her research and became a great influence both for her students and for other women in her field.|$|E
25|$|Both Art and Horace were very, {{very aware}} of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do. They {{wanted to get away}} from the jazz scene of the early '50s, which was the Birdland scene—you hire Phil Woods or Charlie Parker or J. J. Johnson, they come and sit in with the house rhythm section, and they only play blues and {{standards}} that everybody knows. There's no rehearsal, there's no thought given to the audience. Both Horace and Art knew that the only way to get the jazz audience back and make it bigger than ever was to really make music that was memorable and planned, where you consider the audience and keep everything short. They really liked digging into blues and gospel, things with universal appeal. So they put together what was to be called the Jazz Messengers.|$|E
25|$|Since {{very early}} on, the {{publishing}} duties and design duties {{had actually been}} split, with the Amarillo Design Bureau (ADB) handling all of the product design, while TFG had published, and indicated <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> produce. The end of TFG put everything under one house again, and ADB, Inc. spent some time picking up the pieces of nearly three years without SFB. The first order of business, in fact, was to reprint Basic Set and Advanced Missions which {{had been out of}} stock for about three years at this point. While they were at it, all the errata and questions were evaluated, and many sections of the rules were re-written {{in an effort to make}} the game clearer. These editions featured new cover colors and a '1999' legend at the bottom of the cover to show when they were printed.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{time goes}} through a pattern {{throughout}} its entirety of one 4:4 bar, one 2:4 bar and then two 4:4 bars. In writing [...] "Lost and Running", the band was influenced by bands that they have cited as being influences on their music from early on, including David Bowie, The Rolling Stones and Neil Young. In an interview with The Courier Mail, Fanning noted that the song was a very simple one, stating [...] "the actual style of song is quite different as it has very little movement.

500|$|Middleton first {{encountered}} Powderfinger when {{it consisted of}} Bernard Fanning, Ian Haug, John Collins, and Jon Coghill. At the time, Middleton had been playing with Sonic Tapestry, and another band named Pirate. After seeing his band perform, Powderfinger invited Middleton to join them, and he accepted. Middleton described Powderfinger's early days as highly influenced by other popular heavy metal bands at the time, especially Pantera. Despite the band's members all having come from casual projects, the band's meetings were highly serious, according to Middleton, although he admitted they were [...] "confused" [...] in exactly <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> do. Powderfinger generally performed covers of The Rolling Stones, The Doors, Led Zeppelin, and Steppenwolf, as well as Neil Young in their early days, in similar clubs to those in which Middleton had first played.|$|E
500|$|Throughout development, {{staff members}} enjoyed {{the level of}} freedom the game offered, in {{particular}} the transforming abilities of Mario. Iwata noted that Mario's Bee Suit was popular with women, and also stated that the titular character's other suits were designed to add variations to the gameplay. According to Hayashida, the idea to include transformations in the game came from Koizumi. One of the female members of staff who worked on Super Mario Galaxy wrote a note saying [...] "I want a Bee Mario" [...] when asked by Koizumi <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> transform Mario into.
