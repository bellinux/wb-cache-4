25|$|Reference {{has been}} made to the rib vault in Roman work, where the {{intersecting}} barrel vaults were not of the same diameter. Their construction must at all times have been somewhat difficult, but where the barrel vaulting was carried round over the choir aisle and was intersected (as in St Bartholomew-the-Great in Smithfield, London) by semicones instead of cylinders, it became worse and the groins more complicated. This would seem to have led to a change of system and to the introduction of a new feature, which completely revolutionized the construction of the vault. Hitherto the intersecting features were geometrical surfaces, of which the diagonal groins were the intersections, elliptical in form, generally weak in construction and often twisting. The medieval builder reversed the process, and set up the diagonal ribs first, which were utilized as permanent centres, and on these he carried his vault or web, which henceforward took its shape from the ribs. Instead of the elliptical curve which was given by the intersection of two semicircular barrel vaults, or cylinders, he employed the semicircular arch for the diagonal ribs; this, however, raised the centre of the square bay vaulted above the level of the transverse arches and of the <b>wall</b> <b>ribs,</b> and thus gave the appearance of a dome to the vault, such as may be seen in the nave of Sant'Ambrogio, Florence. To meet this, at first the transverse and <b>wall</b> <b>ribs</b> were stilted, or the upper part of their arches was raised, as in the Abbaye-aux-Hommes at Caen, and the Abbey of Lessay, in Normandy. The problem was ultimately solved by the introduction of the pointed arch for the transverse and <b>wall</b> <b>ribs</b> - the pointed arch had long been known and employed, on account of its much greater strength and of the less thrust it exerted on the walls. When employed for the ribs of a vault, however narrow the span might be, by adopting a pointed arch, its summit could be made to range in height with the diagonal rib; and, moreover, when utilized for the ribs of the annular vault, as in the aisle round the apsidal termination of the choir, it was not necessary that the half ribs on the outer side should be in the same plane as those of the inner side; for when the opposite ribs met in the centre of the annular vault, the thrust was equally transmitted from one to the other, and being already a broken arch the change of its direction was not noticeable.|$|E
25|$|In {{the earlier}} stage of rib vaulting, the arched ribs {{consisted}} of independent or separate voussoirs {{down to the}} springing; the difficulty, however, of working the ribs separately led to two other important changes: (1) {{the lower part of}} the transverse diagonal and <b>wall</b> <b>ribs</b> were all worked out of one stone; and (2) the lower horizontal, constituting what is known as the tas-de-charge or solid springer. The tas-de-charge, or solid springer, had two advantages: (1) it enabled the stone courses to run straight through the wall, so as to bond the whole together much better; and (2) it lessened the span of the vault, which then required a centering of smaller dimensions. As soon as the ribs were completed, the web or stone shell of the vault was laid on them. In some English work each course of stone was of uniform height from one side to the other; but, as the diagonal rib was longer than either the transverse or wall rib, the courses dipped towards the former, and at the apex of the vault were cut to fit one another. In the early English Gothic period, in consequence of the great span of the vault and the very slight rise or curvature of the web, it was thought better to simplify the construction of the web by introducing intermediate ribs between the wall rib and the diagonal rib and between the diagonal and the transverse ribs; and in order to meet the thrust of these intermediate ribs a ridge rib was required, and the prolongation of this rib to the wall rib hid the junction of the web at the summit, which was not always very sightly, and constituted the ridge rib. In France, on the other hand, the web courses were always laid horizontally, and they are therefore of unequal height, increasing towards the diagonal rib. Each course also was given a slight rise in the centre, so as to increase its strength; this enabled the French masons to dispense with the intermediate rib, which was not introduced by them till the 15th century, and then more as a decorative than a constructive feature, as the domical form given to the French web rendered unnecessary the ridge rib, which, with some few exceptions, exists only in England. In both English and French vaulting centering was rarely required for the building of the web, a template (Fr. cerce) being employed to support the stones of each ring until it was complete. In Italy, Germany and Spain the French method of building the web was adopted, with horizontal courses and a domical form. Sometimes, in the case of comparatively narrow compartments, and more especially in clerestories, the wall rib was stilted, and this caused a peculiar twisting of the web, where the springing of the wall rib is at K: to these twisted surfaces the term ploughshare vaulting is given.|$|E

40|$|The {{vortical}} {{structure of}} a plane impinging jet is considered. The jet was locked both in phase and laterally in space, and time series digital particle image velocimetry measurements were made both of the jet exiting the nozzle and as it impinged on a perpendicular wall. Iso-vorticity and iso-lambda (2) surfaces coupled with critical point theory were used to identify and clarify structure. The flow near the nozzle was much as observed in mixing layers, where the shear layer evolves into spanwise rollers, only here the rollers occurred symmetrically about the jet midplane. Accordingly the rollers were seen to depict spanwise perturbations with the wavelength of flutes at the nozzle edge and were connected, {{on the same side}} of the jet, with streamwise 2 ̆ 7 successive ribs 2 ̆ 7 of the same wavelength. This wavelength was 0. 71 of the distance between rollers and, contrary to some experiments in mixing layers, did not double when the rollers paired. Structures not reported previously but evident here with iso-vorticity, lambda (2) and critical point theory are 2 ̆ 7 cross ribs 2 ̆ 7, which extend from the downstream side of each roller to its counterpart across the symmetry plane; their spanwise periodic spacing exceeds that of successive ribs by a factor of three. Cross ribs stretch because of the diverging flow as the rollers approach the wall and move apart, causing the vorticity within them to intensify. This process continues until the cross ribs reach the wall and merge with 2 ̆ 7 <b>wall</b> <b>ribs</b> 2 ̆ 7. <b>Wall</b> <b>ribs</b> remain near the wall throughout the cycle and are composed of vorticity of the same sign as the cross ribs, but the intensity level of the vorticity within them is cyclic. Details of the expansion of fluid elements, evaluated from the rate of strain tenser, revealed that both cross and successive ribs align with the principal axis and that the vorticity comprising them is continuously amplified by stretching. It is further shown, by appeal to the production terms of the phase-averaged vorticity equation, that <b>wall</b> <b>ribs</b> are sustained by merging and stretching rather than reorientation of vorticity. Moreover production of vorticity is a maximum when cross and <b>wall</b> <b>ribs</b> merge and is greatest near the symmetry plane of the jet. The demise of successive ribs on the other hand occurs away from the symmetry plane and would appear to be less important dynamically than cross ribs merging with <b>wall</b> <b>ribs...</b>|$|E

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} examples of {{the introduction of the}} intermediate rib is found in the nave of Lincoln Cathedral, and there the ridge rib is not carried to the <b>wall</b> <b>rib.</b> It was soon found, however, that the construction of the web was much facilitated by additional ribs, and consequently there was a tendency to increase their number, so that in the nave of Exeter Cathedral three intermediate ribs were provided between the <b>wall</b> <b>rib</b> and the diagonal rib. In order to mask the junction of the various ribs, their intersections were ornamented with richly carved bosses, and this practice increased on the introduction of another short rib, known as the lierne, a term in France given to the ridge rib. Lierne ribs are short ribs crossing between the main ribs, and were employed chiefly as decorative features, as, for instance, in the Liebfrauenkirche (1482) of Mühlacker, Germany. One of the best examples of Lierne ribs exists in the vault of the oriel window of Crosby Hall, London. The tendency {{to increase the number of}} ribs led to singular results in some cases, as in the choir of Gloucester Cathedral, where the ordinary diagonal ribs become mere ornamental mouldings on the surface of an intersected pointed barrel vault, and again in the cloisters, where the introduction of the fan vault, forming a concave-sided conoid, returned to the principles of the Roman geometrical vault. This is further shown in the construction of these fan vaults, for although in {{the earliest}} examples each of the ribs above the tas-de-charge was an independent feature, eventually it was found easier to carve them and the web out of the solid stone, so that the rib and web were purely decorative and had no constructional or independent functions.|$|R

The rib height and spacing were 0. 1 and 1. 0 passage heights, respectively. The measurements were obtained for Reynolds numbers of 25000, 50000 and 70000. One geometry is equipped with extraction holes to simulate holes for film cooling. Two series of holes are placed solely in the bottom wall, 4 holes are located in the bend, and 12 in the downstream leg. The global extraction through the holes was set to 30 %, 40 % and 50 % of the inlet massflow. This paper presents new measurements of the heat transfer in the straight legs, and in the bend of the passage. It shows the influence of Reynolds number and extraction on full surface measurements and area averaged results...|$|E
40|$|The {{necessity}} {{in detecting}} pregnancy particularly estimating the gestation period in goat is undeniable. This objectives {{of this study}} were to observe images of fetus and fetal-related images in goats throughout pregnancy period, to test the reliability of fetal counting using Real-time B mode ultrasound, to measure and then to compare the development of fetal heart size in both single and twin pregnancies, to compare the changes in heart echogenicity in both single and twin pregnancies in does and to estimate the accuracy of pregnancy detection as well as age related pregnancy structures using ultrasonography. Structures were detected during gestation period including sac, fetus, fetal heart, amniotic fluid, uterine <b>wall,</b> <b>ribs,</b> spinal cord, fetal organ and placentomes. Changes in fetal heart echogenicity and area throughout both single and twin pregnancy were determined and evaluated using ultrasound scanning. Equations to estimate age of gestation were derived from polynomial and linear regression between gestational age and heart area in does for single and twin pregnancies. Blind test was conducted on polynomial and linear relationships between heart area size and gestational age. For polynomial relationship, 65, 69 and 92 % of pregnant does delivered within ± 1, ± 2 and ± 3 weeks of the delivery dates, respectively. Meanwhile, linear relationship gave 62, 69 and 77 %, respectively. In conclusion, sonographic fetometry of fetal heart size is reliable to estimate the age of gestation in goat...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} flow, in three {{stationary}} models of two-pass internal coolant passages is presented, {{which focuses on}} the flow characteristics in the 180 -deg bend region and downstream of the bend, where the flow is redeveloping. A stereoscopic digital Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system, measured all three velocity-components simultaneously to obtain mean-velocity and turbulence quantities of the flow field. The coolant passage models consisted of two square passages, each having a 20 hydraulic diameter length, separated by a web of 0. 2 passage widths, and connected by a sharp 180 deg bend with a rectangular outer <b>wall.</b> <b>Ribs</b> were mounted {{on the bottom and}} top walls of both legs, with a staggered arrangement and at 45 deg to the flow. The rib height and spacing were 0. 1 and 1. 0 passage heights, respectively. They were equipped with extraction holes, to simulate holes for film cooling. Two series of holes were placed solely in the bottom wall, 4 holes were located in the bend, and 12 in the downstream leg. One of the configurations was also provided with a turning vane in the bend, and was equipped with a 60 deg rib arrangement in the downstream leg. The measurements were obtained for a flow condition with a Reynolds number of 50, 000. The global extraction through the holes was set to 50 % of the inlet massflow. This paper presents new measurements, and a comparison of the flow between the two configurations, in the straight legs of the passages, in the bend regions, and details of the flow recovery from the bend in the second legs...|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of the church has a plaster ceiling in a shallow, curved vault. The window bays are demarcated by half-vaults from the <b>wall</b> and <b>ribs</b> on the ceiling, connected with small pendentives. The current interior was installed during the 1957 renovation, including the predella and altar, communion rail, {{and parts of the}} side altars, done in three types of marble.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} an LES study of effects of destabilising {{rotation}} on heat transfer over a ribbed surface in a rectangular duct at Re = 15000. The duct bottom <b>wall,</b> <b>ribbed</b> by flow-normal, equally-spaced squaresectioned ribs, was uniformly heated (except for the ribs) by a constant heat flux. The duct was rotated with angular velocity {{corresponding to the}} rotation number of 0. 3, around an axis parallel to the ribs in counterclockwise direction destabilising the ribbed-wall adjacent flow. These well-resolved LES gave some new insight into the rotation effects on flow and heat transfer providing information that are not easily accessible to experiments. An {{attempt was made to}} identify the heat transfer effects due to the rotation-induced modifications of the secondary motion, and the direct effects on the turbulence statistics, especially the budgets of the temperature variance and turbulent heat flux. It turned out that the former is predominant in the recirculation zone, whereas the latter prevails just after it...|$|R
40|$|Open {{instrumented}} anterior spinal fusion {{for adolescent}} idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a proven technique for vertebral derotation that, compared with posterior spinal fusion procedures, invariably requires fewer distal fusion levels to be performed. With the advent {{and evolution of}} endoscopic anterior instrumentation, further clinical benefits are possible such as reduced pulmonary morbidity, improved cosmesis and less postoperative pain. However, quantitative data on the radiological improvement of vertebral rotation using this method is limited. The {{aim of this study}} was to measure preoperative and postoperative axial vertebral rotational deformity at the apex of the curve in endoscopic anterior instrumented scoliosis surgery patients using computed tomography (CT), and assess the relevance of these findings to clinically measured chest <b>wall</b> <b>rib</b> hump deformity correction. We believe this is the first quantitative CT study to confirm that endoscopic anterior instrumented fusion for AIS substantially improves the axial vertebral body rotational deformity at the apex of the curve. The margin of correction of 43...|$|R
