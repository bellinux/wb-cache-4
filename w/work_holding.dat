25|$|Unlike {{most other}} machine collet systems, 5C collets were {{developed}} primarily for <b>work</b> <b>holding.</b> Superficially similar to R8 collets, 5C collets have an external thread {{at the rear}} for drawing the collet closed and so work pieces may pass right through the collet and chuck (5C collets often also have an internal thread). Collets are also available to hold square stock. 5C collets have a limited closing range and so shank and collet diameters must be a close match.|$|E

[...] The {{fountain}} {{is composed}} of an oblong basin with semi-circular ends, in which are placed allegorical statues related to arts and professions, since the fountain was next to the conservatory of arts and metiers. [...] On one side are two statues by Ottin, who also did the statues in the Medici Fountain; a statue of Mercury, holding a scale, an anchor, and a horn of plenty; and Music, wearing a laurel wreath, holding a lyre and a torch. [...] On {{the other end of}} the fountain are two statues by Gumery; Agriculture, holding sheaves of wheat, and <b>Work,</b> <b>holding</b> a hammer. [...] Between the two groups is a single vasque fountain with a spray of water and water pouring from the heads of lions.|$|E

60|$|June 6.--I arose {{much better}} this morning, having taken some medicine, which has removed the strange and aching {{feeling in my}} back and breast. I believe {{it is from the}} diaphragm; it must be looked to, however. I have not yet breakfasted, yet have cleared half my day's <b>work</b> <b>holding</b> it at the {{ordinary}} stint.|$|E
60|$|Hard work rowing the cab {{through the}} City to the Temple, {{for a cup}} of from five to ten {{thousand}} pounds value, given by Mr Boffin; and hard <b>work</b> <b>holding</b> forth at that immeasurable length to Eugene (when he had been rescued with a rope from the running pavement) for making off in that extraordinary manner! But he offered such ample apologies, and was so very penitent, that when Lightwood got out of the cab, he gave the driver a particular charge to be careful of him. Which the driver (knowing there was no other fare left inside) stared at prodigiously.|$|E
60|$|When {{they had}} {{procured}} sufficient bait, they went toward the river. Their way led them {{not very far}} from the house, and they were several times in situations where they were exposed to view, in case Marco's uncle had looked toward them. Marco, however, contrived to walk by these places {{in such a manner}} as to cover himself as much as possible from view by the other boys; and besides, he hoped that his uncle was too much occupied with his pruning, to notice what boys were prowling about the village. They passed across the street in this manner, and then went down over the intervales toward the river. Marco felt quite relieved at seeing that his uncle kept steadily at his <b>work,</b> <b>holding</b> the ladder for the other man to mount by, or sawing off low branches himself, without appearing to notice the boys at all.|$|E

60|$|The above {{character}} {{may have}} presented {{itself to the}} garrison as applicable to Dirk Schuiler, whom they familiarly dubbed Gallows Dirk. Certain it is, he acknowledged allegiance to no one--was an utter enemy to <b>work,</b> <b>holding</b> it in no manner of estimation--but lounging about the fort, depending upon chance for a subsistence, getting drunk whenever he could get liquor, and stealing whatever he could lay his hands on. Every day or two he was sure to get a sound rib-roasting for some of his misdemeanors; which, however, as it broke no bones, he made very light of, and scrupled not to repeat the offence whenever another opportunity presented. Sometimes, in consequence of some flagrant villainy, he would abscond from the garrison, and be absent for a month at a time; skulking about the woods and swamps, with a long fowling-piece on his shoulder, lying in ambush for game, or squatting himself {{down on the edge}} of a pond catching fish for hours together, and bearing no little resemblance to that notable bird of the crane family, yclept the mudpoke. When he thought his crimes had been forgotten or forgiven, he would sneak back to the fort with a bundle of skins or a load of poultry, which, perchance, he had stolen, and would exchange them for liquor, with which having well soaked his carcase, he would lie in the sun, and enjoy all the luxurious indolence of that swinish philosopher Diogenes. He was the terror of all the farmyards in the country, into which he made fearful inroads; and sometimes he would make his sudden appearance in the garrison at daybreak, with the whole neighborhood at his heels; like the scoundrel thief of a fox, detected in his maraudings and hunted to his hole. Such was this Dirk Schuiler; and from the total indifference he showed to the world and its concerns, and from his truly Indian stoicism and taciturnity, no one would ever have dreamt that he would have been the publisher of the treachery of Risingh.|$|E
