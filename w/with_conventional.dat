5|$|A Passenger Information Display System (PIDS) was {{installed}} in all Metrorail stations in 2000. Displays are located on all track platforms and at the mezzanine entrances of stations, and provide real-time information on next train arrivals, delayed trains, emergency announcements, and related information. WMATA also provides current train and related information to customers <b>with</b> <b>conventional</b> web browsers, as well as users of smartphones and other mobile devices. In 2010 Metro began sharing its PIDS data with outside software developers, for use in creating additional real-time applications for mobile devices. Free apps are {{available to the public}} on major mobile device software platforms (iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Palm). WMATA also began providing real-time train information by phone in 2010.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, {{renewable}} energy {{plays a major}} role in the energy mix of many countries globally. Renewables are becoming increasingly economic in both developing and developed countries. Prices for {{renewable energy}} technologies, primarily wind power and solar power, continued to drop, making renewables competitive <b>with</b> <b>conventional</b> energy sources. Without a level playing field, however, high market penetration of renewables is still dependent on a robust promotional policies. Fossil fuel subsidies, which are far higher than those for renewable energy, remain in place and quickly need to be phased out.|$|E

5|$|As of 2014, {{the wind}} {{industry}} in the USA is able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300 feet to 400 {{feet above the ground}} can now compete <b>with</b> <b>conventional</b> fossil fuels like coal. Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.|$|E
5|$|Between 1978 and 1980, the DoD and USN {{repeatedly}} {{attempted to}} terminate the AV-8B program. There had previously been conflict between the USMC and USN over budgetary issues. At the time, the USN wanted to procure A-18s for its ground attack force and, to cut costs, pressured the USMC to adopt the similarly-designed F-18 fighter instead of the AV-8B to fulfill the role of close air support (both designs were eventually amalgamated to create the multirole F/A-18 Hornet). Despite these bureaucratic obstacles, in 1981, the DoD included the Harrier II in its annual budget and five-year defense plan. The USN declined {{to participate in the}} procurement, citing the limited range and payload compared <b>with</b> <b>conventional</b> aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Concentrated {{solar power}} plants may use thermal storage to store solar energy, such as in {{high-temperature}} molten salts. These salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible <b>with</b> <b>conventional</b> power systems. This method of energy storage is used, for example, by the Solar Two power station, allowing it to store 1.44TJ in its 68m³ storage tank, enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours, with an efficiency of about 99%.|$|E

5|$|During 1958–1960 VAT focused {{increasingly}} on custom-building vehicles {{according to}} customer request. Typically a potential customer just {{walked into the}} main office in Helsinki or factory in Hämeenlinna and described what kind of vehicle he wanted. The enthusiastic engineers listened carefully to every individual customer's wishes and designed vehicles accordingly, {{with two or three}} axles, desired layout, wheelbase and <b>with</b> <b>conventional</b> or forward control cabin. Many vehicle types were only produced for one or two units. The volume model, however, was a nine-tonne variant of the VAK series.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, the Pennsylvania took {{delivery}} of two rail cars that operated in car-and-trailer configuration. Largely {{similar to the}} car ordered by the Reading, these rail cars were also beset by problems with their rubber-tired wheels, which were later replaced <b>with</b> <b>conventional</b> trucks. After being retrofitted, these cars {{went on to become}} the longest surviving of the Budd–Michelin rail cars. They remained with the Pennsylvania until 1943, when they were sold to the Washington and Old Dominion Railroad, a Virginia short line that operated them for only a few months; they were ultimately scrapped in 1948.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to some strengthening, there were alterations {{to the air}} intake, which had throughout the P.1127 and Kestrel series featured an inflatable lip to smooth the intake airflow when the aircraft was almost stationary. There were concerns about the service life of these devices, so they were replaced <b>with</b> <b>conventional</b> suction relief doors. Experience gained during naval testing on board the commando carrier HMS Bulwark in 1966 convinced project officers that less reactive materials would be substituted for all uses of magnesium in the Kestrel's airframe, in any further prototypes and production aircraft. The Kestrel became the prototype for pre-production Harriers.|$|E

The evidence for the effectiveness for such treatments in most cases is weak or absent. Treatments of unproven benefit used by people with MS include dietary supplementation and regimens, vitamin D, relaxation techniques such as yoga, herbal medicine (including medical cannabis), hyperbaric oxygen therapy, self-infection with hookworms, reflexology, acupuncture, and mindfulness.

5|$|Partially {{because of}} the Crewkerne incident, and due to the incessant {{modification}} of Bulleid’s original design, British Railways took the decision to rebuild the entire class to a more conventional design by R. G. Jarvis, adopting many features from the BR 'Standard' locomotive classes that had been introduced since 1950. The air-smoothed casing was removed and replaced <b>with</b> <b>conventional</b> boiler cladding, and the chain-driven valve gear was replaced with three separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear. The rebuilds were provided with a completely revised cylindrical smokebox, a new Lord Nelson-type chimney and LMS-style smoke deflectors. Together {{with the lack of}} air-smoothed casing, these helped reduce the problem of smoke and steam obscuring the driver's vision of the line.|$|E
5|$|Pharmacologically active plant {{extracts}} {{can interact}} <b>with</b> <b>conventional</b> drugs, both {{because they may}} provide an increased dose of similar compounds, and because some phytochemicals interfere with the body's systems that metabolise drugs in the liver including the cytochrome P450 system, making the drugs last longer {{in the body and}} have a more powerful cumulative effect. Plant medicines can be dangerous during pregnancy. Since plants may contain many different substances, plant extracts may have complex effects on the human body.|$|E

5|$|The PV {{industry}} has seen drops in module prices since 2008. In late 2011, factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the $1.00/W mark. The $1.00/W installed cost, is often regarded in the PV industry as marking {{the achievement of}} grid parity for PV. These reductions have taken many stakeholders, including industry analysts, by surprise, and perceptions of current solar power economics often lags behind reality. Some stakeholders still have the perspective that solar PV remains too costly on an unsubsidized basis to compete <b>with</b> <b>conventional</b> generation options. Yet technological advancements, manufacturing process improvements, and industry re-structuring, mean that further price reductions are likely in coming years.|$|E
5|$|The Skylon design {{features}} several distinct differences {{when compared with}} the earlier HOTOL programme. Whereas HOTOL would have launched from a rocket sled as a weight-saving measure, Skylon is to be equipped <b>with</b> <b>conventional</b> retractable undercarriage. The revised engine design, using the SABRE engine, is expected to offer higher performance than its predecessor. The rear mounted engine of HOTOL meant that the vehicle possessed intrinsically poor in-flight stability; early attempts to resolve this problem had ended up sacrificing much of HOTOL's payload potential, which in turn contributed to the failure of the overall project. Skylon's solution to the issue was to position its engines {{at the end of its}} wings, which located them further forward and much closer to the vehicle's longitudinal centre of mass, thereby resolving the instability problem.|$|E
