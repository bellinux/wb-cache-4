A sample of 127 survivors revealed that half have criminal records; 65% have been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder; 21% have been diagnosed with major depression; 7% have been diagnosed with anxiety disorder; and 7% have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.|$|E
5|$|When compared, Black signers <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> were White signers {{to produce}} signs {{outside of the}} typical signing space and to use two-handed signs. Adverbs {{are most likely to}} use a larger signing space. Less marked forms, such as pronouns, determiners, plain verbs, and nouns, tend to be less likely to be {{produced}} outside the typical signing space. The selection of two-handed signs over one-handed signs was found to have systematic constraints on their production. When the sign could be produced with one or two hands, Black signers often produced the variant that matched the handedness of the following sign; if the following sign was two-handed, {{they were more likely to}} produce a two-handed variant, while if the following sign was one-handed, they were more likely to produce the one-handed variant. The use of innovative one-handed forms, though, even in environments which favored them, did not exceed 50 percent.|$|E

25|$|Medicaid super utilizers (defined as Medicaid {{patients}} with {{four or more}} admissions in one year) account for more hospital stays (5.9 vs.1.3 stays), longer length of stay (6.1 vs. 4.5 days), and higher hospital costs per stay ($11,766 vs. $9,032).

25|$|Problem {{benzodiazepine}} use can {{be associated}} with various deviant behaviors, including drug-related crime. In a survey of police detainees carried out by the Australian Government, both legal and illegal users of benzodiazepines were found to be more likely to have lived on the streets, less likely to have been in full-time work and more likely to have used heroin or methamphetamines in the past 30 days from the date of taking part in the survey. Benzodiazepine users {{were also more likely to}} be receiving illegal incomes and more likely to have been arrested or imprisoned in the previous year. Benzodiazepines were sometimes reported to be used alone, but most often formed part of a poly drug-using problem. Female users <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> men to be using heroin, whereas male users were more likely to report amphetamine use. Benzodiazepine users <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> non-users to claim government financial benefits and benzodiazepine users who were also poly-drug users were the most likely to be claiming government financial benefits. Those who reported using benzodiazepines alone were found to be in the mid-range when compared to other drug using patterns in terms of property crimes and criminal breaches. Of the detainees reporting benzodiazepine use, one in five reported injection use, mostly of illicit temazepam, with some who reported injecting prescribed benzodiazepines. The injection was a concern in this survey due to increased health risks. The main problems highlighted in this survey were concerns of dependence, the potential for overdose of benzodiazepines in combination with opiates and the health problems associated with injection of benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} two decades {{following}} the ratification of the Second Amendment, public opposition to standing armies, among Anti-Federalists and Federalists alike, persisted and manifested itself locally as a general reluctance to create a professional armed police force, instead relying on county sheriffs, constables and night watchmen to enforce local ordinances. Though sometimes compensated, often these positions were unpaid – held {{as a matter of}} civic duty. In these early decades, law enforcement officers were rarely armed with firearms, using billy clubs as their sole defensive weapons. In serious emergencies, a posse comitatus, militia company, or group of vigilantes assumed law enforcement duties; these individuals <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> the local sheriff to be armed with firearms.|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} factor determining social mobility in Finland was education. Children who attained {{a higher level of}} education than their parents were often able to rise in the hierarchy of occupations. A tripling or quadrupling in any one generation of the numbers receiving schooling beyond the required minimum reflected the needs of a developing economy for skilled employees. Obtaining advanced training or education was easier for some than for others, however, and the children of white-collar employees still were more likely to become white-collar employees themselves than were the children of farmers and blue-collar workers. In addition, children of white-collar professionals <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> not to remain in that class.|$|E
25|$|In a {{study of}} 135 IVF clinics, 88% had websites, 70% {{mentioned}} PGD and 27% of the latter were university- or hospital-based and 63% were private clinics. Sites mentioning PGD also mentioned uses and benefits of PGD {{far more than the}} associated risks. Of the sites mentioning PGD, 76% described testing for single-gene diseases, but only 35% mentioned risks of missing target diagnoses, and only 18% mentioned risks for loss of the embryo. 14% described PGD as new or controversial. Private clinics <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> other programs to list certain PGD risks like for example diagnostic error, or note that PGD was new or controversial, reference sources of PGD information, provide accuracy rates of genetic testing of embryos, and offer gender selection for social reasons.|$|E
25|$|According to {{results from}} the fifth wave of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study, which interviewed over 14,000 people about their sexual orientation, 94.2% of New Zealanders {{identify}} as heterosexual, 2.6% as gay or lesbian, 1.8% as bisexual, 0.6% as bicurious, 0.5% as pansexual, and 0.3% as asexual. No gender {{differences were found in}} the share of New Zealanders identifying as heterosexual (94.1% of men and 94.4% of women) or pansexual (0.5% of both men and women), but men were more likely to identify as gay (3.5%) than women (1.8%), and women <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> men to identify as bisexual (2.1% versus 1.5%), bicurious (0.7% v. 0.4%) and asexual (0.4% v. 0.1%).

40|$|What {{characteristics}} distinguish liars from truth-tellers? Recent {{research has}} explored "when" and "why" people lie. Yet {{little is known}} about "who" lies. Previous studies have led to mixed results about the effect of gender on deception, and they have largely neglected the role of other characteristics, such as age and level of education. To shed light on these questions, here I report a meta-analysis of 6, 508 distinct observations, collected in 50 Deception Game treatments, by 6 research groups. I find that: (i) males <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> females to tell black lies; (ii) males <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> females to tell altruistic white lies; (iii) males <b>are</b> (marginally) <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> females to tell Pareto white lies; (iv) age has no effect on the decision to tell black lies; (v) age has no effect on the decision to tell altruistic white lies; (vi) age has no effect on the decision to tell Pareto white lies; (vii) educated subjects <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> non-educated subjects to tell black lies; (viii) the level of education has no effect on the decision to tell altruistic white lies; (ix) educated subjects <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> non-educated subjects to tell Pareto white lies.

25|$|One {{study from}} 1996 {{documented}} the interviews {{of a sample}} of junior {{high school students in}} the United States. The girls were less likely to state that they ever had sex than adolescent boys. Among boys and girls who had experienced sexual intercourse, the proportion of girls and boys who had recently had sex and were regularly sexually active was the same. Those conducting the study speculated that fewer girls say they have ever had sex because girls viewed teenage parenthood as more of a problem than boys. Girls were thought to be more restricted in their sexual attitudes; they <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> boys to believe that {{they would be able to}} control their sexual urges. Girls had a more negative association in how being sexually active could affect their future goals. In general, girls said they felt less pressure from peers to begin having sex, while boys reported feeling more pressure.|$|E
25|$|Females <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> {{males to}} be monogamous. One third {{or more of}} the lesbians were monogamous, while the rest fell into the other categories. There were even larger {{differences}} between males and females in sexual behavior. Nearly half of the males had over 500 different sexual partners in a lifetime, another third had between 100 and 500, and over 90 per cent had at least 25 (black gay men were on average slightly less promiscuous than white gay men). Much sex between men took place between strangers, met in baths or bars. 25 per cent of white gay men at some time had sex with boys who were sixteen or younger, after they themselves reached the age of 21. Most lesbians, however, had fewer than 10 same-sex partners over a lifetime, and very few cruised or looked for casual sex. Little lesbian sex took place between strangers. Women's sexual behavior showed a relatively greater level of heterosexual activity and a relatively lower level of homosexual activity compared to that of men.|$|E
25|$|Thinking of virginity as {{a stigma}} disempowered many boys {{because they felt}} deeply ashamed and often tried {{to hide the fact}} that they were virgins from their partners, which for some {{resulted}} in their partners teasing them and criticizing them about their limited sexual techniques. The girls who viewed virginity as a stigma did not experience this shaming. Even though they privately thought of virginity as a stigma, these girls believed that society valued their virginity because of the stereotype that women are sexually passive. This, they said, made it easier for them to lose their virginity once they wanted to because they felt society had a more positive view on female virgins and that this may have made them sexually attractive. Thinking of losing virginity as part of a natural developmental process resulted in less power imbalance between boys and girls because these individuals felt less affected by other people and were more in control of their individual sexual experience. Adolescent boys, however, <b>were</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> <b>than</b> adolescent girls to view their loss of virginity as a positive aspect of their sexuality because it is more accepted by peers.|$|E
