Behind {{him was the}} flour-miller's field, and beyond it the Den, of which only some tree-tops were visible. He looked wearily east the road, but no one emerged from Thrums; he looked wearily west the road, which doubled out of sight at Aaron Latta's cottage, {{little more than a}} stone's throw distant. On the inside of Aaron's window an endless procession seemed to be passing, but it was only the <b>warping</b> <b>mill</b> going round. It was an empty day, but Dite, the accursed, was used to them; nothing ever happened where he was, but many things as soon as he had gone.|$|E
50|$|The {{company can}} trace its origins back to 1797. David Scott, a weaver from Hawkhill near Dundee, bought a {{property}} in Mid Wynd {{in order to}} establish a flax <b>warping</b> <b>mill</b> and hand weaving shed. For the next 150 years, the firm evolved, aided by colonialism, world-wide expansion and two world wars.|$|E
50|$|The mill was {{powered by}} a low breastshot water wheel, 5 ft in {{diameter}} driving the machinery through line shafting. There are currently 15 looms in total, 10 Tappet looms dating to 1890-1932, 3 Dobby looms dating to the 1950s and 2 1960s Hattersley looms acquired in 1972. These days the looms are powered by individual electric motors. In addition there is a <b>warping</b> <b>mill</b> and winding frames also dating from the 1890s.|$|E

The district extends {{on either side of}} Allen Street, an road isolated between Truman Drive (built in the mid-20th century) and the Blackstone River, and includes buildings dating from c. 1860 to c. 1930. Of the five textile mill buildings in the district, four are brick structures built between about 1900 and 1920; the oldest building in the district is the c. 1860 Pond's <b>Warp</b> <b>Mill</b> at 148 Bernon Street. The latter is also adjacent to a rare visible fragment of the once-extensive canal works (now mostly filled in and built over) that characterized the industrial center of Woonsocket. [...] Many of the district's buildings have been converted to housing.|$|R
50|$|The Johnson Family were early {{owners of}} the land in the area and in 1818 sold the {{property}} to Ezra Ramsdell to build a <b>warp</b> thread <b>mill</b> along the Spring Lake River (Mishnock River). Mill housing was constructed along the highway from Washington Village to the Maple Root Meeting House. After the mill burned in 1830 Christopher A. Whitman acquired the land and constructed a mill known as Whitmans’ Yard, which produced shirting material and in 1852, he leased the complex to Pardon Olney and it operated for another thirty years.In 1865 the Peckham family bought the mill and ran it until it burned around 1907. Today the area where the mill village once stood is where the Coventry Plaza, Wood Estates, and the McDonald's on Tiogue Avenue are now located where the mills once stood.|$|R
50|$|Livesey {{was born}} on 5 March 1794 at Walton-le-Dale near Preston, Lancashire, the son of John Livesey, a cloth manufacturer, and Jennett (née Ainsley). His father had a {{warehouse}} and <b>warping</b> <b>mill</b> {{in the village and}} contracted work out to local weavers. However, both Joseph's parents died of tuberculosis when he was 7, and his grandfather, also Joseph Livesey, and uncle, Thomas Livesey, stepped in to run the business and look after the boy; they were not successful and the business had to be wound up after 3-4 years.|$|E
50|$|To {{prepare to}} weave, the warp must be made. By hand {{this is done}} {{with the help of}} a warping board. The length the warp is made is about a quarter to half yard more than the amount of cloth needed. Warping boards come in a variety of shapes, from the two nearest door handles to a board with pegs on it, or a device called a <b>warping</b> <b>mill</b> that looks similar to a swift. Warping the loom, mean {{threading}} each end through an eye in a heddle, and then sleying it through the reed. The warp is set (verb) at X ends per inch. It then has a sett (noun) of X ends per inch. The weft is measured in picks per inch.|$|E

There was also a Dobby version.|$|E
