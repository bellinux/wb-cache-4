In this paper we have investigated an algorithm to detect and predict sudden cardiac death, by processing of heart rate variability signal through the classical and time-frequency methods. At first, one minute of ECG signals, just before the cardiac death event are extracted and used to compute heart rate variability (HRV) signal. Five features in time domain and four features in frequency domain are extracted from the HRV signal and used as classical linear features. Then the <b>Wigner</b> <b>Ville</b> <b>transform</b> is applied to the HRV signal, and 11 extra features in the time-frequency (TF) domain are obtained. In order to improve the performance of classification, the principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to the obtained features vector. Finally a neural network classifier is applied to the reduced features. The obtained results show that the TF method can classify normal and SCD subjects, more efficiently than the classical methods. A MIT-BIH ECG database was used to evaluate the proposed method. The proposed method was implemented using MLP classifier and had 74. 36 % and 99. 16 % correct detection rate (accuracy) for classical features and TF method, respectively. Also, the accuracy of the KNN classifier were 73. 87 % and 96. 04 %...|$|E

SR is a phenomenon in which the response of a nonlinear system to a sub-threshold (weak) input signal is enhanced {{with the addition of}} an optimal amount of noise. There have been an increasing amount of applications based on SR in various fields.
