5|$|Among the key {{indicators}} of Christianisation are long-cist cemeteries that generally indicate Christian burials {{due to their}} East-West orientation, although this correlation has been challenged by recent research. These burials are found {{between the end of}} the Roman era and the 7th century, after which point they become rarer. They are concentrated strongly in eastern Scotland south of the Tay, in Angus, the Mearns, Lothian and the Borders. It is generally accepted among scholars that place-name element eccles-, from the Brythonic word for church, represents evidence of the British church of the Roman and immediate post-Roman period, most of which are located in the south-west, south and east. About a dozen inscribed stones of the 5th and 6th centuries, beginning <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> Latinus stone of Whithorn, dating to c. 450, indicate Christianity through their dedications and are spread across southern Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many other}} Latin American intellectuals, Vargas Llosa was {{initially}} {{a supporter of}} the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro. He studied Marxism in depth as a university student and was later persuaded by communist ideals after the success of the Cuban Revolution. Gradually, Vargas Llosa came to believe that socialism was incompatible with what he considered to be general liberties and freedoms. The official rupture between the writer and the policies of the Cuban government occurred <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> 'Padilla Affair', when the Castro regime imprisoned the poet Heberto Padilla for a month in 1971. Vargas Llosa, along with other intellectuals of the time, wrote to Castro protesting the Cuban political system and its imprisonment of the artist. Vargas Llosa has identified himself with liberalism rather than extreme left-wing political ideologies ever since. Since he relinquished his earlier leftism, he has opposed both left- and right-wing authoritarian regimes.|$|E
5|$|The {{reign of}} Edward III coincided <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> Babylonian Captivity of the papacy at Avignon. During the wars with France, {{opposition}} emerged in England against perceived injustices by a papacy largely {{controlled by the}} French crown. Papal taxation of the English Church was suspected to be financing the nation's enemies, while the practice of provisions – the Pope providing benefices for clerics – caused resentment in the English population. The statutes of Provisors and Praemunire, of 1350 and 1353 respectively, aimed to amend this by banning papal benefices, as well as limiting {{the power of the}} papal court over English subjects. The statutes did not sever the ties between the king and the Pope, who were equally dependent upon each other.|$|E

25|$|The main {{characteristic}} of the Villanovans (with some similarities <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> protovillanovian epoch of the late Bronze Age) were the incinerated sepultures, in which the dead's ashes were housed in double-cone shaped urns and buried. The burial characteristics relate the Villanovan culture to the Central European Urnfield culture (c. 1300–750 BC), and Hallstatt culture (which succeeded the Urnfield culture).|$|E
25|$|The {{police had}} {{lost control of}} the {{situation}} and the National Guard was called in to regain control.

25|$|In 96 BC Rome peacefully {{obtained}} Cyrenaica (left as inheritance by {{the king}} Ptolemy Apion) <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> sovereign Pentapolis, formed by the cities of Cyrene (near the modern village of Shahat), its port of Apollonia, Arsinoe (Tocra), Berenice (near modern Benghazi) and Barce (Marj), that will {{be transformed into a}} Roman province a couple of decades later in 74 BC. The Roman advance southward, however, was stopped by the Garamantes.|$|E
25|$|As {{concerns}} the water flows, the link must comply <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> zero-solution. This {{has been achieved}} by deepening parts of the Great Belt, so that the water flow cross section has been increased. This excavation compensates for the blocking effect caused by the bridge pylons and approach ramps. The conclusion of the report is that water flows are now almost at the level they were before the bridge was built.|$|E

In Northern Amami (Amami Ōshima, Tokunoshima and Kikai Island), the ritsu, min'yō and miyakobushi tetrachords can be found. In this respect, Northern Amami stands {{in sharp contrast}} with the Okinawa Islands, where the ryūkyū and ritsu scales are prevalent. Southern Amami (Okinoerabu and Yoron Islands) are similar to northern Okinawa.|$|E
25|$|In 1204, {{the monks}} at Mt. Hiei implored the head priest {{to ban the}} teachings of {{exclusive}} nembutsu and to banish any adherents from their principality. In 1205 the temple of Kōfuku-ji, located in Nara, implored Emperor Toba II to sanction Hōnen and his followers. The temple provided the emperor with nine charges alleging unappeasable differences <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> eight schools. Hōnen's detractors cited examples of his followers, such as Gyoku and Kōsai, who committed vandalism against Buddhist temples, intentionally broke the Buddhist precepts, or caused others to intentionally turn away from established Buddhist teachings.|$|E
25|$|<b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>so-called</b> Primary Chronicle, also {{attributed}} to Nestor, begins the {{long series of}} the Russian annalists. There is a regular catena of these chronicles, extending with only two breaks to the seventeenth century. Besides the work {{attributed to}} Nestor the Chronicler, we have chronicles of Novgorod, Kiev, Volhynia and many others. Every town of any importance could boast of its annalists, Pskov and Suzdal among others. In some respects these compilations, the productions of monks in their cloisters, remind us of Herodotus, dry details alternating with {{here and there a}} picturesque incident; and many of these annals abound with the quaintest stories.|$|E
