5|$|By 1960, Carson {{had more}} than enough {{research}} material, and the <b>writing</b> <b>was</b> progressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough literature search, she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted. However, in January, a duodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of Silent Spring. As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her left breast, one of which necessitated a mastectomy. Though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December Carson discovered that the tumor was in fact malignant and the cancer had metastasized. Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of The Sea Around Us, and by a collaborative photo essay with Erich Hartmann. Most of the research and <b>writing</b> <b>was</b> done {{by the fall of}} 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on biological controls and investigations of a handful of new pesticides. However, further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962.|$|E
5|$|His {{primary focus}} was gay-themed writing, though {{he also wrote}} about the {{entertainment}} industry. Mostly satirical, his <b>writing</b> <b>was</b> filled with increasingly clear anger and disdain for the Republican neo-con agenda, especially after the AIDS pandemic began to take a large toll on the gay community. A very strong voice in gay literature, Baker had admirers and detractors for his gay radical stance, both in the mainstream literary {{community as well as}} the gay community itself.|$|E

50|$|The {{progressive}} (or continuous) {{aspect is}} expressed with {{a form of}} be together with the present participle of the verb. Thus present progressive (present continuous) constructions take forms like <b>am</b> <b>writing,</b> <b>is</b> <b>writing,</b> <b>are</b> <b>writing,</b> while the past progressive (past continuous, also called imperfect) <b>is</b> <b>was</b> <b>writing,</b> <b>were</b> <b>writing.</b> There <b>is</b> a progressive infinitive (to) <b>be</b> <b>writing</b> and a progressive subjunctive <b>be</b> <b>writing.</b> Other progressive forms, made with compound forms of be, are described below.|$|R
5000|$|Professional <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> {{any type}} of <b>writing</b> that <b>is</b> <b>written</b> with the {{intention}} of communicating with others in a professional and courteous manner to facilitate work. Professional <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> either internal or external to a business or organization, which means that the audience of a <b>written</b> work <b>is</b> either an insider or outsider of the professional writer's organization; examples of internal business writing include email messages, memos, and reports while some examples of external business <b>writing</b> <b>are</b> letters and email messages.|$|R
5|$|Innis {{argued that}} {{a balance between the}} spoken word and writing contributed to the flourishing of ancient Greece in the time of Plato. This balance between the time-biased medium of speech and the space-biased medium of <b>writing</b> <b>was</b> {{eventually}} upset, Innis argued, as the oral tradition gave way to the dominance of writing. The torch of empire then passed from Greece to Rome.|$|E
5|$|Teachers were {{employed}} in the village in 1811 and a Sunday school, built by the Brandlings, providing education in reading and <b>writing,</b> <b>was</b> established by 1833 and used for worship before the church was built. The 1833 school was the premises of a national school in 1845. It became Middleton St Mary's C of E School {{and moved to a}} new site in 1972.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom of the Picts {{as it was}} in {{the early}} 8th century, when Bede was <b>writing,</b> <b>was</b> largely the same as the kingdom of the Scots in the reign of Alexander I (1107–1124). However, by the tenth century, the Pictish kingdom was {{dominated}} by what we can recognise as Gaelic culture, and had developed a traditional story of an Irish conquest around the ancestor of the contemporary royal dynasty, Cináed mac Ailpín (Kenneth MacAlpin).|$|E

40|$|This <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> an experiment, created {{primarily}} {{out of a}} synergy of rhizome, flesh, {{concept and}} hypercreature, although there are also infinite others resonating through the work. This <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> not, however, a ‘rhizomic’ or ‘fleshy’ work: it is neither faithful, nor does it seek to represent; {{it is not a}} rhizomic performance, but rather the <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> performative of hypercreature, rhizome and flesh. It is not a duplicity, but a multiplicity: this <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> an evolution or perhaps a ‘creative involution’ of these concepts...|$|R
5|$|The {{earliest}} Hebrew writing yet discovered, {{found at}} Khirbet Qeiyafa, {{dates to the}} 10th century BCE. The 15 cm x 16.5 cm (5.9 in x 6.5 in) trapezoid pottery sherd (ostracon) has five lines of text written in ink written in the Proto-Canaanite alphabet (the old form of the Phoenician alphabet). The tablet is written from left to right, indicating that Hebrew <b>writing</b> <b>was</b> still in the formative stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{invention}} of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary {{with the beginning of}} the Bronze Age in the late 4th millennium BC. The Sumerian archaic cuneiform script and the Egyptian hieroglyphs are generally considered to be the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400–3200 BC with the earliest coherent texts from about 2600 BC. It is generally agreed that Sumerian <b>writing</b> <b>was</b> an independent invention; however, it is debated whether Egyptian <b>writing</b> <b>was</b> developed completely independently of Sumerian, or was a case of cultural diffusion. A similar debate exists for the Chinese script, which developed around 1200 BC. The pre-Columbian Mesoamerican writing systems (including among others Olmec and Maya scripts) are generally believed to have had independent origins.|$|E
5|$|The older <b>writing</b> <b>was</b> {{first noticed}} by Pierre Allix, a Protestant pastor. Jean Boivin, {{supervisor}} of the Royal Library, made the first extracts of various readings of the codex (under the notation of Paris 9) to Ludolph Küster, who published Mill's New Testament in 1710. In 1834–1835 potassium ferricyanide was used to bring out faded or eradicated ink, which {{had the effect of}} defacing the vellum from green and blue to black and brown.|$|E
5000|$|The {{technique}} of Wilson Harris {{has been called}} experimental and innovative. Harris describes that conventional <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> different from his style of writing in that [...] "conventional <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> straightforward writing" [...] and [...] "My <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> quantum <b>writing.</b> Do you know of the quantum bullet? The quantum bullet, when it's fired, leaves not one hole but two." ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Writing</b> <b>is</b> {{a medium}} of human {{communication}} that represents language and emotion with signs and symbols. In most languages, <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> a complement to speech or spoken language. <b>Writing</b> <b>is</b> not a language, but a tool {{used to make}} languages be read. Within a language system, writing relies {{on many of the}} same structures as speech, such as vocabulary, grammar, and semantics, with the added dependency of a system of signs or symbols. The result of <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> called text, and the recipient of text is called a reader. Motivations for writing include publication, storytelling, correspondence and diary. <b>Writing</b> has <b>been</b> instrumental in keeping history, maintaining culture, dissemination of knowledge through the media and the formation of legal systems.|$|R
50|$|The text <b>is</b> <b>written</b> in one column per page, {{original}} {{number of}} lines is unknown, the survived fragment has only two lines.

5|$|Upon release, Halo: The Flood {{cracked the}} Publishers Weekly Top Ten Bestsellers List for Paperbacks, but {{critical}} reception {{to the novel}} was less positive than Eric Nylund's Fall of Reach or other Halo novels. The repetitive fight scenes and dramatically different characterization of the protagonist compared to Nylund's work were seen as major flaws, and Dietz's style of <b>writing</b> <b>was</b> alternatively praised and lambasted. The next Halo novel, , would serve {{to bridge the gap}} between Combat Evolved and its sequel, Halo 2.|$|E
5|$|When released, Raptor Red was {{generally}} praised: Bakker's anthropomorphism {{was seen as}} a unique and positive aspect of the book, and his <b>writing</b> <b>was</b> described as folksy and heartfelt. Criticisms of the novel included a perceived lack of characterization and average writing. Some scientists, such as paleontologist David B. Norman, took issue with the scientific theories portrayed in the novel, fearing that the public would accept them as fact, while Discovery Channel host Jay Ingram defended Bakker's creative decisions in an editorial.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} his first novel was {{published}} Maugham began contributing to magazines and periodicals; initially these were short stories, but he also wrote opinion pieces, non-fictional and autobiographical work, and letters. Much of his non-fictional <b>writing</b> <b>was</b> published in book form, and covered a range of topics, including travel, current affairs, autobiography and belles lettres. Maugham was also editor {{on a number of}} works, which often included adding a preface or introductory chapter to the work of other writers. In 1903 his first play was performed, A Man of Honour at the Imperial Theatre, London. It was the first of many of his works that were produced for the stage, and with the later development of cinema, his novels and stories were also adapted for the big screen.|$|E
5000|$|Digital <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> a {{new type}} of {{composition}} being taught increasingly within universities. Digital <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> a pedagogy focused on technology's impact on <b>writing</b> environments; it <b>is</b> not simply using a computer to write. Rather than the traditional print perspective, digital writing enables students to explore modern technologies and learn how different writing spaces affect the meaning, audience, and readability of text. Educators in favor of digital writing argue that it is necessary because [...] "technology fundamentally changes how <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> produced, delivered, and received." [...] The goal of teaching digital <b>writing</b> <b>is</b> that students will increase their ability to produce a relevant, high-quality product, instead of just a standard academic paper.|$|R

But its also what makes it resonate, makes it mean {{something}} {{to the person who}} reads it. <b>Writing</b> <b>is</b> exhibitionism. <b>Writing</b> <b>is</b> dragging something out of you, kicking and screaming. <b>Writing</b> <b>is</b> also craft, which is only achieved through pure drudgery. At the end of it all, someone says, you spoke to me, and its all worth it." ...|$|R

5|$|Agârbiceanu's {{old and new}} {{writings}} {{came out}} in several editions: Pagini alese ("Selected Works", 1956), Din munți și din câmpii ("From Mountains and Plains", 1957), Din copilărie ("Childhood Memories", 1957), File din cartea naturii ("Pages from the Book of Nature", 1959), Povestind copiilor ("Stories for Children", 1961) and Faraonii ("The Pharaohs", 1961). Although formally congratulated by the regime, Agârbiceanu fell out with its censorship apparatus. According to various accounts, he allowed the censors to operate multiple changes, {{as long as the}} substance of his <b>writing</b> <b>was</b> not itself altered. Portions of his work were cut out during reediting, and a novel, Prăbușirea ("The Downfall"), serialized in Gazeta Literară, was so crudely handled that seven of its pages were lost forever.|$|E
5|$|Although {{most of the}} {{writings}} that have survived from this period are religious in nature, there is sufficient literary evidence that secular <b>writing</b> <b>was</b> also popular in the imperial court. Some of these writings carry useful information on urban life, grandeur of the imperial and provincial courts, royal weddings and ceremonies. Other works refer the general town planning, fortifications and ordnance details at Vijayanagara and other important cities, irrigation reservoirs, merchants and shops dealing {{in a variety of}} commodities. On occasion, authors dwell on mythical cities that reflect their idealised views on contemporary life. Commonly found in these works are description of artists and professionals and their relationship with the court. These included poets, bards, composers, painters, sculptors, dancers, theatrical performers and even wrestlers. Others who find mention are political leaders, ambassadors, concubines, accountants, goldsmiths, moneylenders and even servants and door keepers.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the first}} century AD, the Coptic {{alphabet}} started to be used alongside the Demotic script. Coptic is a modified Greek alphabet {{with the addition of}} some Demotic signs. Although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the fourth century, towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read them. As the traditional religious establishments were disbanded, knowledge of hieroglyphic <b>writing</b> <b>was</b> mostly lost. Attempts to decipher them date to the Byzantine and Islamic periods in Egypt, but only in 1822, after the discovery of the Rosetta stone and years of research by Thomas Young and Jean-François Champollion, were hieroglyphs almost fully deciphered.|$|E

5|$|As he was {{completing}} work on Dubliners in 1906, Joyce considered {{adding another}} story featuring a Jewish advertising canvasser called Leopold Bloom {{under the title}} Ulysses. Although he did not pursue the idea further at the time, he eventually commenced work on a novel using both the title and basic premise in 1914. The <b>writing</b> <b>was</b> completed in October 1921. Three more months were devoted to working on the proofs of the book before Joyce halted work shortly before his self-imposed deadline, his 40th birthday (2 February 1922).|$|E
5|$|Cardus's {{approach}} to cricket <b>writing</b> <b>was</b> innovative, turning what {{had previously been}} largely a factual form into vivid description and criticism; he is considered by contemporaries to have influenced every subsequent cricket writer. Although he achieved his largest readership for his cricket reports and books, he considered music criticism as his principal vocation. Without any formal musical training, he was initially influenced by the older generation of critics, in particular Samuel Langford and Ernest Newman, but developed his own individual style of criticism—subjective, romantic and personal, {{in contrast to the}} objective analysis practised by Newman. Cardus's opinions and judgments were often forthright and unsparing, which sometimes caused friction with leading performers. Nevertheless, his personal charm and gregarious manner enabled him to form lasting friendships in the cricketing and musical worlds, with among others Newman, Sir Thomas Beecham and Sir Donald Bradman.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin's <b>writing</b> <b>was</b> {{shaped by}} {{his work as}} a {{cataloguer}} at Sotheby's, which provided him with years of practice writing concise yet vivid descriptions of objects with the intention of enticing buyers. In addition, Chatwin's interest in nomads also influenced his writing. One aspect of nomadic culture that interested him was the few possessions they had. Their spartan way of life appealed to his aesthetic sense, and it was something he sought to emulate in both his life and his writing. He strove to strip unnecessary objects from his life and unnecessary words from his prose.|$|E
