One key issue that affects the application of wear debris analysis for machine condition monitoring is whether the morphology of the wear particles accurately depicts their original states and the surface morphology of the components from which the particles separate. This study aimed to investigate {{the evolution of the}} surface morphology of wear debris in relation to change in the surface morphology of <b>wear</b> <b>components</b> in sliding <b>wear</b> process. Sliding wear tests were conducted using a ball-on-disc tester under proper lubrication and improper lubrication conditions.

40|$|Driving {{and timing}} chains {{are widely used}} machine {{elements}} which are continuously improved regarding wear and energy efficiency. Especially for timing chains, reducing wear is of high importance as the chain is critical for {{the function of the}} combustion engine. To achieve this goal, the wear within the chain joint has to be measured precisely which is usually done by measuring the length of the entire chain. With this measurement, no information about the distribution of wear between the contacting bodies, pin and bush, is available. An additional measuring and analyzing technique using a standard roundness instrument is developed with which more detailed information about the wear within the chain joint is obtained. With this new method, unworn chain joint components are characterized and the wear on <b>worn</b> <b>components</b> is measured and compared for pins with different surface treatments.

Moreover, for the surfaces of <b>wear</b> <b>components</b> that are difficult to access or analyze, it is possible to evaluate the quantitative surface information of the <b>wear</b> <b>components</b> through studying the surface characterization of corresponding wear particles.

Wear particles were collected in running-in and steady-state wear stages and analysed using ferrography, a particle analyser, confocal laser scanning microscopy and computer image analysis techniques. Surface roughness parameters w;ere used to study the evolutions of the surface morphology of wear particles from running-in to steady state wear stages.

40|$|Running in is {{a complex}} process, and it {{significantly}} influences the performance and service life of <b>wear</b> <b>components</b> as the initial phase of the entire wear process. Surface topography is an important feature of <b>wear</b> <b>components.</b> Therefore, {{it is reasonable to}} investigate the running-in process with the help of surface topography for improvement. Because the surface roughness after running in is independent of the nature of initial roughness, it is difficult to predict the surface topography after running in based on unworn surface topography. Aiming to build a connection of surface topographies before and after the running-in process, a black-box model predicting surface topography after the running-in process was established based on least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), and the areal surface evaluation parameters were adopted as model variables. To increase the adaptability of the predictive model, the main factors of the work condition were also taken into consideration. The prediction effect and sensitivity of the model were tested and analyzed. The analysis indicates that the hybrid property of surface topographies before and after running in is closely related. Moreover, the surface topography after running in is influenced more by the initial surface topography than by the work condition...|$|R

40|$|Wear is {{responsible}} for numerous industrial problems leading to increased maintenance costs due to the necessity of replacing <b>worn</b> <b>components</b> or due to equipment failure and manufacturing process downtime. Surface treatments can improve performance because the component maintains its ductile interior but with significantly improved surface wear resistance while using a minimal amount of material. Niobizing the surface of tool steel leads {{to the formation of}} very hard coatings, in the range of 2300 HV, composed of niobium carbide but with limited thickness. Boriding also produces very hard coatings, on order of 2000 HV, but with a much thicker layer than attainable by the niobizing treatment. If both were applied to the same material they could potentially complement each other by forming a duplex coating with a thin, but very hard, surface coating supported by an inner layer with slightly lower hardness but substantially thicker. The objective of this work was to evaluate the wear resistance of a coating formed by the niobizing and boriding diffusion treatments. Boron and niobium coatings were prepared on AISI H 13 tool steel by thermo-reactive diffusion treatment in molten borax with 10 [*]wt% aluminum followed by the niobium carbide pack process. The boriding treatment was performed at 900 °C for 2 h, followed by a pack process at 1000 °C for 2, 4, and 6 h. Optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, micro-adhesive wear test, and Vickers micro-hardness were used to analyze the samples.

40|$|Use of {{the high}} powered diode laser (HPDL) for direct metal {{deposition}} enables multiple layer cladding to be performed with a nominally rectangular beam, traversed at different angles to the fast axis, or with a fiber-coupled, circular beam. These factors may provide an advantage over the traditional beam profiles of CO 2 and Nd:YAG lasers, {{so there is a}} need to examine the effect that they have on the process and final product characteristics. This article reports such an examination. A 1. 5 kW HPDL and 316 L stainless steel powder are used to experimentally investigate the dimensions, microstructure, surface finish, and hardness of multiple layer walls produced using nominally rectangular and circular beams under a range of conditions. The diode beam profiles are modeled using a "Gaussian beam array" method for the nominally rectangular beam and a "concentric series" method for the fiber-coupled beam. Quasistationary state temperature profiles are produced for both beam shapes by superposition of Gaussian source solutions. The experimental results show little difference in microstructural properties, elemental composition, or hardness due to beam shape or traverse direction, but track dimensions are dependent on beam geometry. Wall width is particularly dependent on beam size orthogonal to the traverse direction. Modeling allows some of the results encountered to be explained in terms of temperature distributions and cooling rates. Fiber coupling seems to provide a benefit if even thin-wall dimensions are required for applications such as rapid prototyping, while using the rectangular beam provides advantages for bulk material addition for applications such as repair and refurbishment of <b>worn</b> <b>components.</b> (C) 2005 Laser Institute of America...|$|E

The production of high-end structural components poses a challenge {{to bring about the}} closed loop recycling of <b>worn</b> <b>components</b> and increase the use of recycled aluminum scraps. Designers will need to integrate the environmental dimension in the design of aluminum-alloyed parts over their entire lifecycle. Although many ecodesign methods and tools are currently available, there is a gap in their integration into the design process in industry, {{as well as in the}} daily practice of the designers. Moreover, existing ecodesign methods are not tailored to the lightweight context. This paper proposes a holistic approach to ecodesign geared to operate within a PLM (Product Life cycle Management) system. A PLM system is a set of tools used to create and manage the product information through its whole life cycle. Within the mechanical design area, a PLM system is composed of the traditional design tools such as Computer-aided design (CAD), Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), Computer-aided engineering (CAE), etc … and allows bidirectional informational flows between the embedded tools. The proposition aims to foster sustainable design solutions for high-end structural parts used in the transport sector, especially in the automotive and aeronautic industries. It consists on developing a PLM-based single-block ecodesign method in order to achieve: (1) a simplified environmental assessment of a reference product and its design alternatives by providing results in a comparative way; and (2) the stimulation of improvement ideas and a solutions-generation phase thanks to dedicated environmental guidelines. The expected result is an efficient iterative and continuous ecodesign tasks between the environmental assessment and improvement. The proposition is conceived to be handled by the design team and to exchange product information with their traditional design tools within a PLM platform...|$|E
40|$|The High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) Thermal Spraying {{technique}} {{has been widely}} adopted in many industries due to its flexibility, and cost effectiveness in producing superior quality of coating. The demand of high-technology industries {{and the availability of}} new advanced materials have generated major advances in this field. The HVOF thermal spray process has been utilised in many industries to apply coatings on components to protect against wear, heat and corrosion, and also to build up <b>worn</b> <b>components.</b> This spraying technology is not limited to coating substrates but also encompasses the manufacture of net shaped component from materials which are sometimes difficult to form by conventional methods. A knowledge of coating properties, testing and evaluation methods is essential in order to apply coating technology to a specific application. While spraying parameters and substrate surface preparations directly impact the coating properties, it is equally important to know the spraying technique required to deposit coating having these properties and the processing parameters which have to be applied. The thesis reports the development and optimisation of the HVOF thermal spray process for coating, forming and repair of components. A die was designed to manufacture free standing WC-Co inserts, and a similar technique was then followed to fabricate free standing annular rings and solid discs. The effects of spraying parameters on the components properties such as residual stresses and hardness were investigated and limitations identified. Experiments to assess the coatings properties involved the combinations of three spraying powders, (1) Austenitic stainless steel (2) WC-Co and (3) Tool steel match powder on stainless steel 316 L andD 2 tool steel substrates. Investigations were carried out on the effect of spraying distance, sprayed coating thickness and pre-spray heat treatment on coating properties including hardness, bond strength and residual stress. Results reveal that there are strong correlations between the bonding strength, coating thickness and residual stress in coatings. The tensile residual stresses coupled with increasing coating thickness cause the degradation of bond strength with increasing coating thickness. Optimisation of the repair of damaged components using the HVOF technique involved the use of similar combinations of powder and substrate materials. Tests were carried out to identify the adhesion strength of the repaired material sprayed under various conditions which were varied, including (1) repair thickness (2) prerepair and post-repair heat treatment (3) repair wall angle and (4) substrate surface preparation. In addition, the finish machining possibility of these repaired components was evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Reclamation of <b>worn</b> <b>components</b> by {{arc welding}} is {{considered}} to be a standard costeffective industrial practice. However, gaps remain in the understanding of the solidification process and phase transformations in distinct weld zones of metal to metal wear resistant welds, deposited by self shielded flux cored arc process, as well as the interaction between thermal cycles and heat flow in the weld metal and the base metal. Improved understanding is necessary to guide alloy and process development to ensure the quality, reliability and performance of repaired components, extending service life of industrial assets and avoiding catastrophic engineering and environmental failures. Three metal-to-metal wear resistant alloys designed for deposition using self-shielded, flux cored arc welding (SSAW) have been investigated. The alloys have been designated LSMM 30, MSMM 40 and HSMM 55; and have carbon equivalents (CE (IIW)) ranging from - 0. 8 to 2 and deposited hardness from 30 to 50 HRC. The objective was to investigate the effect on structure and properties of pre-heat in the range 100 degrees celsius to 300 degrees celsius, as well as a non-conventional high pre-heat temperature above the estimated martensitic start temperature, MS. It was found that weld deposits produced for cooling rates representative of recommended pre-heats (below MS) consisted of 3 distinct macroscopic regions: Region 1 comprising the primary as solidified weld metal (WM); Region 2, a reaustenitised heat affected zone consisting of a grain coarsened heat affected zone (GCHAZ) and a grain refined heat affected zone (GRHAZ); and Region 3, a 2 ̆ 2 dark etching 2 ̆ 2 region extending from the intercritical heat affected zone (ICHAZ) to a subcritical tempered region developed from welded structure that had experienced a peak temperature above about 600 degrees celsius. Although two distinct weld regions (WM and HAZ) are usually identified for conventional ferritic weld deposits, the hard facing weld metals investigated in the current research showed a sub-division of the HAZ into two distinct regions. It is concluded that the 2 ̆ 2 dark etching 2 ̆ 2 Region 3 is a result of a strong etching response because of the presence of significant residual carbide and the occurrence of tempering via the weld thermal cycle. In contrast, Region 2 experiences complete re-austenitisation with subsequent transformation to substantially untempered martensite and/or bainite. This structure shows a comparatively lower etching response...|$|E
