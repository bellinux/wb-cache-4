25|$|The first fully {{terrestrial}} vertebrates were amniotes — {{their eggs}} had internal membranes {{that allowed the}} developing embryo to breathe but kept water in. This allowed amniotes to lay eggs on dry land, while amphibians generally need to lay their eggs in water (a few amphibians, such as the Surinam toad, have evolved other <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> around this limitation). The first amniotes apparently arose in the middle Carboniferous from the ancestral reptiliomorphs.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{prior to}} 1840 the postal system was expensive, {{confusing}} and seen as corrupt. Letters were {{paid for by}} the recipient rather than the sender, and were charged according to the distance the letter had travelled and the number of sheets of paper it contained. Sir Rowland Hill reformed the postal system based on the concepts of penny postage and pre payment. In his proposal Hill also called for official pre-printed envelopes and adhesive postage stamps as alternative <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> the sender to pay for the postage, at a time when prepayment was optional, which led to the invention of the postage stamp, the Penny Black.|$|E

25|$|The various {{techniques}} of fast bowling {{lend themselves to}} three <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> the batsman out. They may be bowled or caught LBW either by speed, the yorker or by seam or swing causing the ball to move in toward them, in which case placement of fielders is irrelevant. Swing or seam may be employed to move the ball away from the batsman {{in which case the}} ball will strike the outside edge of the bat and may be caught in the slips. A badly-played bouncer will either fly off the outside edge as above or may result in a mistimed shot that can be caught near the boundary.|$|E
25|$|Common <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> concussions are any {{head to head}} hits or any hits {{that involve}} a hard blow to the skull. Every year nearly 135,000 {{children}} ranging from age 5 to 18 are treated for concussions and other head injures from sports or other recreational activities. Many concussions come from sports such as wrestling, football, boxing and any other sport that risks getting hit in the head. Wearing head gear can help prevent concussions. Also wearing a frontal paid that protects the forehead and {{top of the head}} is very effective in protecting the head from a hit that may cause a concussion. Wearing a mouth piece can help prevent concussions as well.|$|E

[...] Although Arbuckle was eventually acquitted, motion picture executives sought <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> good publicity for Hollywood. [...] One means was an exposition, to be held in Los Angeles in mid-1923. [...] To induce Congress to issue a commemorative coin as a fundraiser for the fair, organizers associated the exposition with the 100th anniversary of the Monroe Doctrine, and legislation for a commemorative half dollar for the centennial was passed.|$|E

500|$|Early in December 1968 Bessell {{was summoned}} to Thorpe's office in the House of Commons. According to Bessell, Thorpe said of Scott: [...] "We've {{got to get rid}} of him", and later: [...] "It is no worse than {{shooting}} a sick dog." [...] Bessell said later that he was unsure whether Thorpe was serious, but decided to play along, by discussing various <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> rid of Scott's body. Thorpe supposedly thought that disposal down one of Cornwall's many disused tin mines offered the best option, and also suggested his friend David Holmes as an appropriate assassin. Holmes, one of four assistant treasurers of the Liberal Party appointed by Thorpe in 1965, had been best man at Thorpe's wedding, and was completely loyal to him.|$|E

500|$|There {{are four}} {{categories}} of uncertainty {{that can affect}} the validity of a trust: conceptual uncertainty, evidential uncertainty, ascertainability and administrative unworkability. [...] "Conceptual uncertainty" [...] is where the language is unclear, something {{which leads to the}} trust being declared invalid. [...] "Evidential uncertainty" [...] is where a question of fact, such as whether a claimant is a beneficiary, cannot be answered; this does not always lead to invalidity. [...] "Ascertainability" [...] is where a beneficiary cannot be found, while [...] "administrative unworkability" [...] is where the nature of the trust is such that it cannot realistically carried out. Trustees and the courts have developed various <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> around uncertainties, including the appointment of experts to work out evidential uncertainty, and giving trustees the power to decide who is or is not a beneficiary.|$|E

On Friday 2 October, 10:10 placed a notice on their website saying, [...] "Many people found the resulting film extremely funny, but unfortunately some didn't and we sincerely apologise to anybody we have offended. [...] At 10:10 we're all about trying new and creative <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> people to take action on climate change. Unfortunately in this instance we missed the mark.

[...] A spokesman for 10:10 also denied that the withdrawal had been planned from the beginning in order to generate publicity. After removing the video from YouTube, 10:10 issued a statement: [...] "We won't be making any attempt to censor or remove other versions currently in circulation on the internet". Then, on Monday 5 October 10:10 director Eugenie Harvey issued a second, more comprehensive apology, stating: [...] "We are... sorry to our corporate sponsors, delivery partners and board members, who have been implicated in this situation despite having no involvement in the film's production or release." ...|$|E

Like all matter, electrons have both wave and particle properties (as theorized by Louis-Victor de Broglie), and their wave-like properties mean that a beam of electrons can be made to behave like a beam of electromagnetic radiation. The wavelength of electrons is related to their kinetic energy via the de Broglie equation. An additional correction must be made to account for relativistic effects, as in a TEM an electron's velocity approaches the speed of light,c.|$|E

2500|$|Heine and {{his fellow}} radical exile in Paris, Ludwig Börne, had become the role models for a younger {{generation}} of writers who were given the name [...] "Young Germany". They included Karl Gutzkow, Heinrich Laube, Theodor Mundt and Ludolf Wienbarg. They were liberal, but not actively political. Nevertheless, they still fell foul of the authorities. In 1835 Gutzkow published a novel, Wally die Zweiflerin ("Wally the Sceptic"), which contained criticism of {{the institution of marriage}} and some mildly erotic passages. In November of that year, the German Diet consequently banned publication of works by the Young Germans in Germany and – on Metternich's insistence – Heine's name was added to their number. Heine, however, continued to comment on German politics and society from a distance. His publisher was able to find some <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> around the censors and he was still free, of course, to publish in France.|$|E
2500|$|Back in Portugal, {{the news}} of the defeat at Tangier and the {{subsequent}} treaty were received with shock. John of Reguengos immediately set sail for Asilah, hoping to negotiate Ferdinand's release in return for Salah ibn Salah's son (still being held hostage by Henry), but to no avail. [...] The question of what to do divided Ferdinand's older brothers. Ceuta was highly symbolic – the brothers had been made knights there when their father conquered the city back in 1415. [...] Peter of Coimbra, who had been adamantly opposed to the whole Tangier expedition to begin with, urged their eldest brother, King Edward of Portugal, to fulfill the treaty immediately, order the evacuation of Ceuta and secure Ferdinand's release. [...] But Edward was caught in indecision. Henry the Navigator, who stayed in Ceuta, depressed and incommunicado after the defeat in Tangier, eventually dispatched letters to Edward counseling against ratifying the treaty he had himself negotiated and suggesting other <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> Ferdinand released without surrendering Ceuta. [...] But Ferdinand himself wrote letters to Edward and Henry from Asilah noting that the Marinids were not likely to release him for anything less than Ceuta, urging them to fulfill the treaty and wondering what the delay was.|$|E
2500|$|Horrobin, within {{several years}} of {{founding}} Efamol, was selling EPO in more than 25 countries. He marketed the supplement {{as a treatment for}} [...] "PMS, alcoholism, pregnancy-induced hypertension, atopic eczema, elevated cholesterol levels, hypertension, scleroderma, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, mastalgia (breast pain) and other problems", but according to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Horrobin did not satisfactorily demonstrate the efficacy and safety of his supplement. The FDA advised Efamol not to ship EPO to the United States without obtaining approval. Horrobin agreed, but began making shipments. Horrobin conspired with General Nutrition, Inc. to process Efamol into capsules in California; it would then be sold to General Nutrition and relabeled for resale under a different brand name. According to an FDA investigation, Horrobin suggested marketing strategies to circumvent the laws, including coaching retail representatives on making oral claims to customers, [...] "planting articles on their research in the media, deploying researchers to make claims on their behalf, using radio phone-ins" [...] and other tactics. Horrobin wrote to General Nutrition, [...] "Obviously you could not advertise Efamol for these purposes but equally obviously there are <b>ways</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> the information across". As a result, the FDA began to seize shipments of EPO and handed down felony indictments to General Nutrition, several executives and store managers for [...] "conspiring to defraud the FDA and violating provisions of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act". General Nutrition and its president entered guilty pleas and paid fines, but Horrobin was not prosecuted.|$|E
