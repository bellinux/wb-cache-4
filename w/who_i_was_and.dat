And you know, when no one understands you, no one can call you to account. Not even the court could call me to account. But the dead can. They understand. They don't even have to have been there, but if they do, they understand even better. Here in prison they were with me a lot. They came every night, whether I wanted them to or not. Before the trial I could still chase them away when they wanted to come.|$|E
500|$|Headstrong is {{the debut}} studio album by American singer Ashley Tisdale, {{released}} on February 6, 2007, by Warner Bros. Records. [...] Tisdale {{began working on}} the project after the first installment of High School Musical (2006), and after she had achieved the feat {{of being the first}} female artist to debut with two songs on the Billboard Hot 100. Tisdale describes her work on the album saying. [...] "I didn't really know <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>and</b> I {{was trying to figure out}} who to do. I now am way more comfortable in my own skin." [...] The singer worked with a variety of established writers and producers on the album, including Diane Warren, J.R. Rotem, Ryan Tedder, Evan [...] "Kidd" [...] Bogart, and Kara DioGuardi, among others. Commenting that the album garnered its title from her personality, Tisdale said she wanted to use her first album to formally introduce herself personally, and as not one of the characters she portrays.|$|E
500|$|Dismayed {{at being}} typecast as the token pretty girl in British films, Zeta-Jones {{relocated}} to Los Angeles. She remarked, [...] "There {{was all this}} fuss about <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>and</b> wasn't dating. I was a pretty face and a big bust and nothing else. People in the business believed what they read about me. So I decided to move away and start again." [...] She believed that the anonymity she faced in America helped her get roles on merit and not due to her public image. She earned the part of Sala, the hench-woman to the villainous Drax (Treat Williams) in the superhero film The Phantom (1996), starring Billy Zane in the titular role. A reviewer for Variety considered Zeta-Jones to be a standout in her part, but the film received a negative critical reception and earned little at the box office. The CBS television miniseries Titanic (1996), however, was better received. Starring opposite Peter Gallagher and George C. Scott, she portrayed the lead role of Isabella Paradine, a young mother engaged in an extramarital affair on the [...]|$|E

500|$|On 22 May 1911 Mahler {{was buried}} in the Grinzing {{cemetery}} (...) , as he had requested, under a tombstone inscribed only with his name because [...] "any who come to look for me will know <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>and</b> the rest don't need to know." [...] Alma, on doctors' orders, was absent, but among the mourners at a relatively pomp-free funeral were Arnold Schoenberg (whose wreath described Mahler as [...] "the holy Gustav Mahler"), Bruno Walter, Alfred Roller, the Secessionist painter Gustav Klimt, and representatives from many of the great European opera houses. The New York Times, reporting Mahler's death, called him [...] "one of the towering musical figures of his day," [...] but discussed his symphonies mainly in terms of their duration, incidentally exaggerating the length of the Second Symphony to [...] "two hours and forty minutes." [...] In London, The Times obituary said his conducting was [...] "more accomplished than that of any man save Richter," [...] and that his symphonies were [...] "undoubtedly interesting in their union of modern orchestral richness with a melodic simplicity that often approached banality," [...] though it was too early to judge their ultimate worth.|$|E

Speaking to his lifelong friend Roger Hill, Orson Welles expressed his concern about the visit's effect on his daughter. [...] "Rita barely knows me now," [...] Welles said. He recalled seeing Hayworth three years before at an event which the Reagans held for Frank Sinatra. [...] "When it was over, I came over to her table and I saw that she was very beautiful, very reposed looking, and didn't know me at first. After about four minutes of speaking, I could see that she realized <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> <b>and</b> she began to cry quietly." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2001, Reznor {{successfully}} completed rehab, and eventually moved from New Orleans to Los Angeles. In a 2005 interview with Kerrang, he reflected on his self-destructive past: [...] "There was a persona that had run its course. I {{needed to get}} my priorities straight, my head screwed on. Instead of always working, I {{took a couple of}} years off, just to figure out <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>and</b> working out if I wanted to keep doing this or not. I had become a terrible addict; I needed to get my shit together, figure out what had happened." [...] In contrast to his former suicidal tendencies, he admitted in another interview that he is [...] "pretty happy". Nine Inch Nails' next full-length album, With Teeth (2005), reached number one on the Billboard 200.|$|E

In that process, I've had to determine <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>am.</b> <b>I</b> do not think you can {{be all things to all}} people.

She explained, [...] "I never looked deeply at the pain from my past, {{never tried to}} understand that pain and work it through. It was a journey I had avoided. But one I now had to face." [...] Robert Hilburn added, [...] "Jackson found a universal symbol to use in exploring issues of insecurity and self-worth. At some point, everyone is {{on the wrong side}} of the velvet rope, excluded because of race, social status, age or some other division." [...] Jackson regarded commercial success as a secondary consideration, commenting, [...] "I needed to express <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>and</b> what I'd learned. I found out who I really was... If that can inspire people who hear this album to do the same, I'd rather have that than the biggest selling album in the world." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her autobiography, , was {{published}} during July 2003 by HarperCollins. In the book, Lords chronicled her childhood, career and mostly her {{past in the}} porno movie industry. The book received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success making The New York Times Best Seller list. It was criticized by porno movie industry insiders. In the book, Lords revealed that she received only $35,000 as total compensation for all her porno movies, including the $5,000 for her underage appearance in Penthouse. Lords continued to use the now famous stage name that she had given herself as a minor, and ultimately made it her legal name. She explained, [...] "I chose to stop running from it. Instead, I won it, legally changing my name to Traci Elizabeth Lords. That's <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was,</b> <b>and</b> that's who I was going to be." [...] In her interview with Oprah Winfrey she stated: [...] "I found you can run, but you cannot hide." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} recorded in 2005 for a DVD special feature, Remington Steele co-creator Michael Gleason and star Stephanie Zimbalist discuss {{the large number}} of women who have approached them over the years to express their appreciation for the character of Laura Holt. Speaking of the women she meets, Zimbalist said [...] "They are extraordinary women.... They are interesting. They do interesting things. They are smart. They're independent. They're sort of, what my character was – and I meet them all the time." [...] Also in 2005, Robin Rauzi published an article in the Los Angeles Times saying that Laura Holt was her hero. In a subsequent interview Rauzi elaborated, saying that Laura [...] "was one of the only examples of an unmarried modern career woman on TV that I could identify with at that time" [...] and that Laura [...] "didn’t seem that far away from <b>who</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>and</b> who I could be."
