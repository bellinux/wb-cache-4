25|$|When Emma regains consciousness, {{she gets}} out of the car to confront Ingrid, believing that she was there. But Emma refuses to believe Ingrid when she warns her that Gold only <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> her for his own self-benefits. Emma notices that the image is an {{illusion}} as she tries to touch Ingrid, so she returns to the car and speeds off to the mansion. As Emma arrives at the place, Gold sets up the hat to absorb her and her powers in a closed room. Emma waits for Gold at the other side, and before she opens the door, Gold appears behind her, telling Emma that everything will be fine once her powers are gone, and that she will be able to live a normal life. Emma then thanks Gold, not knowing will happen next as she ponders about opening the door.|$|E

500|$|From 1973 {{until the}} PDPA {{unification}} in 1977, Amin was {{second only to}} Taraki in the Khalqist PDPA. When the PDPA ruled Afghanistan, their relationship {{was referred to as}} a disciple (Amin) following his mentor (Taraki). This official portrayal of the situation was misleading; their relationship was more work-oriented. Taraki needed Amin's [...] "tactical and strategic talents"; Amin's motivations are more uncertain, but it is commonly believed that he associated with Taraki to protect his own position. Amin had attracted many enemies during his career, the most notable being Karmal. According to the official version of events, Taraki protected Amin from party members or others who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> the PDPA and the country.|$|E

500|$|One day, Vivien hears {{crying in}} the {{basement}} and goes down to investigate where she finds an exhausted and stressed Nora (Lily Rabe), taking care of a baby. Vivien approaches a confused Nora who mistakes her for a nanny and demands she be called Mrs. Montgomery. Vivien complies and Nora confesses the baby took one breath before dying, thus keeping the baby's ghost in the house. Nora recognizes Vivien and insults her for having a baby that won't stop crying to which Vivien defends the baby. Vivien asks for permission to hold him, to which Nora angrily refuses and proclaims the baby as hers as arrangements were made with which Vivien regretfully complies. Vivien offers help in calming her still crying son to which Nora finally agrees. Vivien calms her child almost immediately, Nora confesses she does not have the constitution to be a caring mother and she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> the baby and leaves the baby to Vivien to get a [...] "good rest". Finally free of anyone trying to claim her child, [...] Vivien asks Moira to join their family as the baby's godmother, which she happily accepts. Vivien names their baby Jeffrey. Together, as one happy family, they all celebrate Christmas by decorating a tree in the abandoned house with various ornaments found in the attic. Watching from outside, Hayden tells Tate that Violet will never forgive him for what he did and that he should get over her, but he resolves to wait for her [...] "forever".|$|E

2500|$|After {{a search}} of Celia’s cabin turned up nothing, William Powell interrogated Celia, who {{made no attempt to}} flee after killing her [...] "owner", and instead resumed her normal activities. Celia {{initially}} denied any knowledge of what had happened to Newsom, but Powell continued to interrogate her, using accusations and threats to get her to confess. Eventually, Celia confessed that she had killed Newsom and attempted to dispose of his body, although she maintained that [...] "she did not intend to kill him when she struck him, but only <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> him." [...] After obtaining Celia’s confession, the family gathered evidence of Robert Newsom’s remains and collected them in a box.|$|E

2500|$|When Silas {{suffers a}} heart attack, Lynsey {{is faced with}} a dilemma when he is placed under her care. Hassan {{revealed}} that her character is not [...] "thinking straight" [...] {{and even though it}} is her job to save lives, Lynsey can not decide if she should {{come to the aid of}} the person who attempted to kill her. Lynsey is not sure if Silas is genuinely ill. In March 2011, Hassan revealed that Silas would want revenge on Lynsey after her telling people that he is behind recent murders. Hassan told a reporter from All About Soap that Lynsey innocently buys diet pills for Cheryl off the internet but Silas sees this as an opportunity to seek revenge and switches them with his heart medication, leading to Cheryl collapsing in Chez Chez. Cheryl is found by Lynsey, who is terrified for Cheryl and feels guilty. Lynsey is told that Cheryl has sedatives in her system although she is [...] "completely flummoxed" [...] as to how this happened as she does not consider that Silas would have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> Cheryl. Hassan explained that Silas plans to [...] "blacken" [...] Lynsey's name with the scheme. Rawle revealed that Silas would work on [...] "discrediting" [...] Lynsey and would undermine her because she is aware of his secret. He explained that Silas would do this by breaking into her flat and moving things around in the middle of the night, adding that [...] "it's like a war of attrition" [...] with Silas planning to [...] "wear her down and send her mad".|$|E
2500|$|After {{receiving}} {{letters from}} Violet Keppel from Paris assuring her she only had feelings for her, Sackville-West had almost fainted {{when she read}} an announcement in a newspaper of Violet's engagement to Major Denys Trefusis. Sackville-West's response was to travel to Paris to see Keppel, taking her to the Hotel Roosevelt where she wrote in her diary: [...] "I treated savagely, I made love to her, I had her, I didn't care, I only <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> Denys". Keppel had used the engagement {{as a way of}} eliciting the response from Sackville-West she had wanted, and the next day Major Trefusis [...] "almost turned white" [...] when he discovered his fiancee and Sackville-West together in bed, a discovery that came as a great shock as he believed the two were just friends, and had apparently believed that women were incapable of falling in love with one another. That night, Sackville-West had dinner alone at the Ritz while Keppel watched her lovingly from the window in her room at an adjoining hotel while Denys Trefusis laid on the bed crying. Under strong pressure from her mother Alice Keppel, a deeply depressed and suicidal Keppel did marry Major Trefusis, though she made it clear that she did not love him. Sackville-West called the marriage her greatest failure as she made a plan for Keppel to escape with her to avoid marrying Trefusis, but was too cowardly to carry it out, later writing [...] "I sat quite dazed in my room holding my watch in my hand and watching the hands tick past the hour of Violet's wedding. All the time, I knew, she was expecting a prearranged message from me, which I never sent".|$|E

60|$|Sometimes, {{down the}} trough of {{darkness}} {{formed by the}} path under the hedges, men came lurching home.

60|$|Rose {{slammed the}} door behind him and left Philip alone. Philip shivered with rage. He went back to his study and turned the {{conversation}} over in his mind. He hated Rose now, he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> him, he thought of biting things he might have said to him. He brooded over the end to their friendship and fancied that others were talking of it. In his sensitiveness he saw sneers and wonderings in other fellows' manner when they were not bothering their heads with him at all. He imagined to himself what they were saying.|$|E

Years ago, when he hated her because she made him so unhappy, he would have been glad to tell her. He <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> her then as she hurt him, because his hatred was only love.

I don't think they <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hurt</b> me: it was rather curiosity than anger I saw in their faces. But I was afraid, and shrank back. They were eager to see me, however, and pressed forward with loud cries, so that the men in blue suits had hard work to prevent them.|$|E
