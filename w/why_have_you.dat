25|$|In 1998, a Christian {{organization}} {{asked to}} ban caricatures {{published by the}} satirical magazine La Grosse Bertha. One of its covers represented the Christ dying with the inscription: I suck was his name by Robert Obscene and Alain Porno from the Acadébite (a play on the words Academy and penis), on inside page a cartoon with the Christ saying <b>Why</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> forsaken Me Jerk? and the apostles {{at the foot of}} the cross carrying banners: pension forced to 33 years, Job insecurity, in back page, a drawing titled miscellaneous news item illustrated with a disemboweled slept naked woman a crucifix crashed in the vagina and on another cover under the title: the Pope at the transvestites, a drawing representing Pope John-Paul II sodomized by a transvestite who exclaims: welcome to Brazil. The courts of first instance and appeal decided that they didn't constituted an incitement to hatred towards the Catholics. The Supreme Court of Appeal held that the first court of appeal had made a procedural error, and referred the matter back to another court which confirmed the absence of conviction decided by the lower courts and considered that mockery of the Catholic religion, the faiths, the symbols and the rites of the religious practice had not caused any state of mind for incitement to discrimination, hatred or violence and was no justification to restrict the liberty of the press.|$|E

Having demonstrated Persian power at Naxos, Datis now intended to show clemency {{to the other}} islands, if they submitted to him. He sent a herald to the Delians, proclaiming: [...] "Holy men, <b>why</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> fled away, and so misjudged my intent? It is my own desire, and the king's command to me, to do no harm to the land where the two gods were born, neither to the land itself nor to its inhabitants. So return now to your homes and dwell on your island." [...] Datis then burned 300 talents of frankincense {{on the altar of}} Apollo on Delos, to show his respect for one of the gods of the island. The fleet then proceeded to island-hop across the rest of Aegean on its way to Eretria, taking hostages and troops from each island.|$|E

2500|$|The {{theme of}} divine hiddenness, silence or {{darkness}} {{has a long}} history in Judeo-Christian theology. The roots of the Judeo-Christian description of God as hidden are in the Bible, for example in the Psalms, [...] "My God, my God, <b>why</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> forsaken me?....I cry by day, but you do not answer....", and in Isaiah: [...] "Truly you are a God who hides himself, O God of Israel, the Savior." ...|$|E

[...] Hezbollah blamed US Defense Secretary Robert Gates, saying his visit coincided with the Bahraini crackdown. After the Bahraini government formally complained to Beirut over Hezbollah's criticism, Lebanese President Michel Sleiman called King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa {{and asked him to}} ensure the safety of Lebanese expatriates in Bahrain, who had reportedly expressed concern about facing potential retaliation over Nasrallah's remarks.|$|E

2500|$|Kolodiejchuk (the {{official}} {{responsible for}} gathering evidence for her canonisation) thought that her unhappiness might be misinterpreted by some, but her faith that God was working through her was undiminished; although she pined for lost closeness to God, {{she did not}} question his existence. Teresa may have experienced something similar to Jesus, who said when he was crucified: [...] "Eli Eli lama sabachthani?" [...] ("My God, my God, <b>why</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> forsaken me?") Kolodiejchuk drew a comparisons to the 16th-century mystic John of the Cross, who coined the phrase [...] "Dark Night of the Soul". Other saints (including Teresa's namesake Thérèse of Lisieux, who called it a [...] "night of nothingness") had similar experiences of spiritual dryness. According to James Langford, these doubts were typical {{and would not be}} an impediment to canonisation.|$|E
2500|$|Mark's gospel is {{nevertheless}} still {{seen as the}} most reliable of the four {{in terms of its}} overall description of Jesus's life and ministry. This recognition allows scholars to chart the evolution of Jesus in the scriptures: Mark's Christ, for example, dies with the cry, [...] "My God, my God, <b>why</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> forsaken me?"; Matthew, the next gospel to be written, repeats this word for word but manages to make clear that Jesus's death {{is the beginning of the}} resurrection of Israel; Luke has a still more positive picture, replacing Mark's (and Matthew's) cry of despair with one of submission to God's will ("Father, into your hands I commend my spirit"); while John, the last gospel, has Jesus dying without apparent suffering in fulfillment of the divine plan. Historical reconstruction suggests that the original despairing death of Jesus has become more and more victorious over time.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{noted that}} God had already {{informed}} Moses that Pharaoh {{would not allow}} the Israelites to go, as in [...] God told Moses, [...] "I know that the King of Egypt will not allow you to go," [...] and in [...] God told Moses, [...] "I will harden his heart." [...] But Moses did not keep this in mind, but came instead to doubt the wisdom of God's decree, and began to argue with God, saying in [...] "Lord, <b>why</b> <b>have</b> <b>You</b> dealt ill with this people?" [...] For this reason, the Attribute of Justice sought to attack Moses, as [...] says: [...] "And God spoke to Moses" [...] (employing the name of God ( [...] , Elohim) indicative of God's Justice). But when God reflected that Moses only asked this because of Israel's suffering, God retracted and dealt with Moses according to the Attribute of Mercy, as [...] says: [...] "And He said to him: ‘I am the Lord'" [...] (employing the name of God ( [...] , the Tetragrammaton) indicative of God's Mercy). The Midrash viewed the question of Moses in [...] as an application of Ecclesiastes [...] "And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness and folly; for what can the man do who comes after the King? even that which has been already done." [...] The Midrash taught that [...] refers to both Solomon and Moses. The Midrash taught that [...] refers to Solomon, for God gave some commandments for kings, as it says in [...] "Only he shall not multiply horses to himself [...] [...] [...] Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away; neither silver and gold." [...] Solomon read in [...] that the reason of God's decree was [...] "that his heart turn not away." [...] The Midrash taught that Solomon thus thought to himself that he would multiply his wives but still not allow his heart to turn away. And the Midrash taught that [...] refers to Moses because Moses began to argue with God in [...] "Lord, <b>why</b> <b>have</b> <b>you</b> dealt ill with this people?" [...] On account of this, the Midrash taught that {{at that point the}} wisdom and knowledge of Moses was only (in the words of [...] ) [...] "madness and folly." [...] The Midrash asked what right Moses had to question God's ways and in the words of [...] "that which had been already done" [...] that God had revealed to him.|$|E
