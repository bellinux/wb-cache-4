2500|$|The {{name for}} this event is from a Norwegian word meaning [...] "sloping path." [...] This event is the most {{technical}} para-alpine skiing disciplines, with a vertical drop of only [...] to [...] on an intentionally iced course. This is the shortest of all the para-alpine skiing events and uses two different courses. Skiers go down each course once, with their finishing position being determined based on their combined course completion time. There are gates in this event, about 55-75 for men and 40-60 for women, and if a skier misses a gate, they are disqualified from the race. After the first run, the bottom 20% of finishers can be eliminated from the competition {{at the discretion of}} the judges. The starting order for the second run is starts with the slowest of the top 15 skiers, with the fastest skier in the first run skiing 15th. Any skiers who finished outside the top 15 then ski in order based on their times from the first run. For example, the 18th fastest finisher in the first run skis 18th in the second run. Skiers used straight ski poles for this event. In some competitions that require qualification for entry, a skier can qualify for this discipline through Downhill, Slalom or Super-G. The IPC/FIS run jointly sanctioned events for Slalom. This race is included on the current Paralympic programme. Skiers often <b>wear</b> <b>pads</b> when competing in this discipline.|$|E

50|$|The catcher is {{normally}} behind home plate in a squatted position (some plays may require the catcher {{to stand at}} an angle for intentional walks). At the plate the catcher is responsible for catching pitches, keeping mispitched balls {{in front of the}} plate, calling pitches that are normally done through hand signals, and they are considered the leaders of the field. Catchers must know how many outs there are, the number of strikes and balls on the batter so they can relay that to their teammates. They must also know how many runners are on base and where the ball should be thrown next in the following play. Catchers are strong, need to be smart and quick on their feet, and have accurate throws so they can pick runners off at each base. Catchers should be able to have strong and muscular legs to squat {{for a long period of}} time. The gear worn by a catcher protects them from balls thrown in the dirt or wild pitches. The catcher is allowed to take off his/her mask to catch a pop fly or to watch the play. The catchers gear can be very hot. Some catchers <b>wear</b> <b>pads</b> under their knees to help keep the knees healthy.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Currently {{there is}} an {{increasing}} demand for composites and joints composed of hard materials, such as ceramics, superabrasives or metal-carbides, and metals. <b>Wear</b> <b>pads,</b> welded or brazed machining tools or composites employed for grinding tools are typical fields of application. All those various materials solutions have in common that there are interfaces between materials that typically have a covalent or ionic bonding and metals. Consequently, wetting and bonding problems arise. The paper presents different examples and discusses them with emphasize on the corresponding interfacial interactions. Furthermore measures are analysed {{that can be taken}} to influence the intensity and strength of the interfacial bonding between the materials to be joined...|$|E

With {{preservation of}} the anal transitional zone, a mean maximum resting pressure of 57. 6 ± 3. 8 mmHg was obtained compared with 47. 3 ± 4 mmHg in the mucosectomy group. Preservation of the resting pressure is dependent on preservation of internal anal sphincter integrity. The integrity of the sphincter is injured during mucosectomy due to anal dilation.

40|$|AIM: To {{examine the}} use and {{satisfaction}} of absorbent (incontinence) pads in independently living men and women aged 60 and above with urinary incontinence (UI). METHODS: The subjects participated in a large-scale study about the prevalence of UI. All the independently living patients in nine family practices aged 60 or above with uncomplicated UI, {{who were willing to}} participate in the study were interviewed at home. RESULTS: In total, 56 men and 314 women were interviewed. Fifteen per cent of the men and 87 % of the women with UI used pads. All men and nine out of 10 women used different kinds of absorbent pads, and half of the men and women used pads specifically made for UI. Only half of the men and two-third of the women felt satisfied with the pads. The reasons for not being satisfied were: leakage, irritation and discomfort. The use of pads, the use at daytime and the type of pads were correlated to the severity of incontinence. CONCLUSION: Only one out of nine men with UI uses pads in contrast with four out of five women. Only half of them <b>wear</b> <b>pads</b> specifically made for UI.

40|$|There {{is a high}} {{prevalence}} of pelvic floor disorders amongst the female population which increases with increasing age and may have {{a great impact on}} the quality of life. Young nulliparous women might be suffering from pelvic floor symptoms after pelvic fractures although exact incidences are not known. Women with stress or urge urinary incontinence may also complain of incontinence during sexual intercourse although this is seldom mentioned voluntarily. The conservative and surgical treatment of coital incontinence is not clear and has not been examined scientifically. The aim of any surgical pelvic floor intervention is to improve and maintain normal bladder, bowel and sexual function. Due to high recurrence rates after native tissue pelvic organ prolapse operations, synthetic mesh is increasingly used to serve as a substitute for insufficient connective tissue. However, meshes can result in severe complications including chronic inflammation and infection. This manuscript focuses on pelvic floor function which is evaluated with specific standardised or validated instruments to assess bladder, bowel and sexual function, prolapse symptoms and symptom-specific quality of life. Three retrospective studies assess pelvic floor symptoms after pelvic trauma, coital incontinence after Burch colposuspension and mesh-induced postoperative complications. Two interventional studies look at pelvic floor symptoms after abdominal sacrocolpopexies. Methods All women after pelvic fractures were asked to fill in a standardised questionnaire on pelvic floor symptoms. Coital incontinence and other symptoms were assessed after Burch-colposuspension in women with stress and coital incontinence. In women with complications after multifilament mesh insertion, pelvic floor symptoms and pain patterns were analysed in different pelvic floor centres. In two studies, the effect of abdominal sacrocolpopexy on the posterior compartment was studied using pelvic floor questionnaires. Results Two third of the mainly nulliparous women developed pelvic floor disorders. Incontinence and the need to <b>wear</b> <b>pads</b> significantly reduced {{the quality of life in}} these women. Burch colposuspension resulted in cure of coital incontinence in 70 % leading to improved sexual function. Severe pelvic pain syndromes including dyschezia and dyspareunia are possible complications of multifilament vaginal mesh insertion and severely impact on the quality of life. Although sacrocolpopexy resulted in excellent anatomical apical cure, symptomatic rectoceles recurred in up to 36 %. Excessive defaecation straining increased the risk for mesh detachment from the perineum which resulted in recurrent rectoceles. Discussion Pelvic floor function and patient satisfaction are important outcome parameters in observational and interventional studies which might contribute to improved patient care. Pelvic floor symptoms and quality of life should routinely be assessed...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: We {{evaluated}} the somatic and autonomic innervation of the pelvic floor and rhabdosphincter {{before and after}} nerve sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy using neurophysiological tests and correlated findings with clinical parameters and urinary continence. Materials and Methods: From February 2003 to October 2005, 46 patients with prostate cancer were enrolled in a controlled, prospective study. Patients were evaluated before and 6 months after nerve sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy using the UCLA-PCI urinary function domain and neurophysiological tests, including somatosensory evoked potential, and the pudendo-urethral, pudendo-anal and urethro-anal reflexes. Clinical parameters and urinary continence were correlated with afferent and efferent innervation of the membranous urethra and pelvic floor. We used strict criteria to define urinary continence as complete dryness with no leakage at all, not requiring any pads or diapers and with a UCLA-PCI score of 500. Patients with a sporadic drop of leakage, requiring up to 1 pad daily, were defined as having occasional urinary leakage. Results: Two patients were excluded from study due to urethral stricture postoperatively. We evaluated 44 patients within 6 months after surgery. the pudendo-anal and pudendo-urethral reflexes were unchanged postoperatively (p = 0. 93 and 0. 09, respectively), demonstrating that afferent and efferent pudendal innervation to this pelvic region was not affected by the surgery. Autonomic afferent denervation of the membranous urethral mucosa was found in 34 patients (77. 3 %), as demonstrated by a postoperative increase in the urethro-anal reflex sensory threshold and urethro-anal reflex latency (p< 0. 001 and 0. 0007, respectively). Six of the 44 patients used pads. One patient with more severe leakage required 3 pads daily and 23 showed urinary leakage, including 5 who needed 1 pad per day and 18 who did not <b>wear</b> <b>pads.</b> Afferent autonomic denervation at the membranous urethral mucosa was found in 91. 7 % of patients with urinary leakage. of 10 patients with preserved urethro-anal reflex latency 80 % were continent. Conclusions: Sensory and motor pudendal innervation to this specific pelvic region did not change after nerve sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy. Significant autonomic afferent denervation of the membranous urethral mucosa was present in most patients postoperatively. Impaired membranous urethral sensitivity seemed {{to be associated with}} urinary incontinence, particularly in patients with occasional urinary leakage. Damage to the afferent autonomic innervation may have a role in the continence mechanism after nerve sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy.
