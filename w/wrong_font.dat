For a moment I froze {{in front of the}} computer, {{thinking}} about writing a letter of complaint to the company for sending us the <b>wrong</b> <b>font.</b> After a while I checked the Bembo Italic and I slowly began to realise that the fonts were Bembo. I calmed down enough to recall that the typeface was originally designed for metal type, and most of the specimens and texts I saw were set in metal type in text size. That was why the images of the characters did not overlap. I knew that a metal typeface was cut or designed separately for each size, but a film composition or digital face is a kind of compromise having proportions designed for reduction and enlargement. I was overwhelmed to see the huge gap. Then I looked into the types used in Western offset-litho prints to see the digital Bembo types in use... the types that were originally designed for hot-metal often looked too light and feeble... Bembo Book is more or less what I expected." ...|$|E

5|$|Release of The X-Files seasons on Blu-ray, {{restored}} in high-definition, {{was rumored to}} begin in late 2013. The German TV channel ProSieben Maxx began airing first-season episodes reformatted in widescreen and in high-definition on January 20, 2014. On April 23, 2015, Netflix began streaming episodes of The X-Files in high definition, marking {{the first time that}} the series has been made available in the high resolution format in North America. In October 2015, it was confirmed that the complete series would be reissued on Blu-ray, and the full set was released on December 8, 2015. The set was criticized for using the <b>wrong</b> <b>fonts</b> for the title sequence and season 8 was affected by color balance issues making the picture appear darker in most episodes. These issues let to Fox offering corrected discs and eventually issuing new sets with the correct color balance.|$|R

50|$|As {{early as}} 1821, {{at least one}} of the missionaries, Hiram Bingham, was using macrons (and breves) in making {{handwritten}} transcriptions of Hawaiian vowels. The missionaries specifically requested their sponsor in Boston to send them some type (fonts) with accented vowel characters, including vowels with macrons, but the sponsor made only one response and sent the <b>wrong</b> <b>font</b> size (pica instead of small pica). Thus, they could not print ā, ē, ī, ō, nor ū (at the right size), even though they wanted to.|$|E
5000|$|However, due to {{features}} such as its 'a' and 'e', with larger counters and apertures than in Granjon's design, its ball terminal detailing and an increased level of contrast between thick and thin strokes, {{it has also been}} compared to fonts from the late eighteenth century, the so-called 'transitional' genre, in particular the Baskerville typeface of the 1750s. Historian and sometime Monotype executive Allan Haley commented that compared to Plantin [...] "serifs had been sharpened...contrast was increased and character curves were refined," [...] while Lawson described Times's higher-contrast crispness as having [...] "a sparkle Plantin never achieved." [...] (The 'a' of Plantin was already not directly sourced from Granjon's work: the sheet from the Plantin-Moretus Museum used as a specimen for Monotype to use in designing Plantin had an 'a' from the <b>wrong</b> <b>font.)</b> Other changes from Plantin include a straight-sided 'M' and 'W' with three upper terminals not Plantin's four, both choices that move away from the old-style model.|$|E
