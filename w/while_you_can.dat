That is, <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> sign 'dog chew bone' for the dog chewed on a bone, or 'she look-at me' for she looked at me, you cannot {{do the same in}} the durative to mean the dog gnawed on the bone or she stared at me. Instead, you must use other strategies, such as a topic construction (see below) to avoid having an object for the verb.|$|E

His father built engines as the crew chief for Norm Nelson and Roger McCluskey's United States Automobile Club (USAC) racecars. Because his work {{involved}} travel, Kulwicki's father was unable to help his son at most kart races, so Kulwicki's resourcefulness was often tested trying {{to find someone to}} transport his kart to the track. Even when Kulwicki asked his father for advice, he typically ended up doing most of the work himself. [...] "I showed him how", Gerry Kulwicki said. [...] "And he said: 'Why don't you do it? You can do it better.' And I said, 'Well, if you do it for a <b>while,</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> do it better.'" ...|$|E
500|$|It was {{met with}} general acclaim from {{television}} critics. Calling it engaging, Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly opined that A Very Gaga Thanksgiving was [...] "disarmingly direct, sincere, and unpretentious." [...] Tucker praised Lady Gaga's performances in the television special, expressing {{that they were a}} [...] "warm, low-key collection of solid performances of her hits and pop standards." [...] Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times deemed the television special as a [...] "dream or a hallucination." [...] The Guardian journalist Hadley Freeman wrote, [...] "It was all inoffensive, silly and knowing, and laid down the groundwork for what looks likely to be the singer's next career: as America's in-house eccentric, fearless enough to satirize the country's traditions but canny enough to know that <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> deface as many Irving Berlin songs as you like, the turkey is non-negotiable." [...] In contrast, A Very Gaga Thanksgiving was critically panned by Jen Carlson of Gothamist, who felt that it was a [...] "very transparent marketing ploy for the new Gaga holiday release." ...|$|E

500|$|An {{avenue of}} oak trees runs up Lennie Hill from the Grotto Bridge. At the summit, Hope-Weir had an {{ornamental}} temple built in 1759, commanding wide {{views of the}} expanded estate and beyond. Craigiehall Temple was a circular two-storey structure, with a stair tower at the rear and a pedimented portico on the front. The segmental pediment bears {{the arms of the}} 1st Marquess of Annandale, and so predates the temple. In The Buildings of Scotland: Edinburgh, it is suggested that this portico may have formed part of a gate to the forecourt of the house. If so, it may have been made by Alexander McGill, to a design by John Erskine, Earl of Mar. It was incorporated into the temple, which was again to the design of one of the Adam brothers. A Latin inscription on the temple, again from Horace, can be translated as [...] "live happy <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> among joyful things". The structure was burned by vandals in the early 1970s, and in 1977 the upper storey was removed as a hazard to aviation, following {{the development of a new}} longer runway at nearby Edinburgh Airport. The remaining storey was renovated, and now forms part of a private house.|$|E

They also staged Michael Landy's Market. At this time, Hirst said, [...] "I can’t wait {{to get into a}} position to make really bad art and get away with it.

2500|$|Wario's Woods has {{received}} mild to favorable reviews. Reviewing the SNES version, GamePro called it [...] "a ho-hum puzzler", commenting that {{though it has}} some interesting gameplay mechanics, it ultimately fails {{to be more than}} a standard Tetris clone. They also regarded the controls as difficult. Nintendo Power reviewed the game noting that it had a fun two-player mode and was challenging and fast-paced while saying that it's not as easy to control as Tetris 2. For the individual scores, the game ranked scores evenly for graphic and sound for both systems, but gave slightly higher scores for the Super NES in the Play Control, Challenge, and Theme and Fun categories. A reviewer for Next Generation argued that the gameplay mechanics are too complicated for an action puzzle game, concluding that, [...] "After a <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> become interested, but the learning curve is just too steep, the rewards too slim." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some of the game's {{criticism}} {{stemmed from}} the limitations of what procedural generation can bring to a game. While the engine can produce {{a vast array of}} different planets, it is built atop a finite number of predetermined assets, such as basic creature shapes or planetary biomes, and one quickly exhausts these core assets even with the variations allowed by procedural generation. An evaluation of the game's code showed that Hello Games had the foresight to enable new predetermined assets to be added into the game through updates, which Gamasutra Alissa McAloon suggested that with more artists to provide more content, Hello Games or third-parties could exponentially expand the perceived uniqueness of each planet. Kate Compton, who worked on the procedural generation elements of Spore, called this issue [...] "procedural oatmeal", in that <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> pour a near infinite number of bowls of oatmeal with various differences, the end result still will look like a bowl of oatmeal. Compton noted that No Man's Sky lacks a quality of perceptual uniqueness, a problem that other game researchers are looking to try to solve to provide a more crafted but still procedurally generated experience to the player, placing less emphasis on the vastness of potential outcomes as No Man's Skys marketing relied on.|$|E
2500|$|Hammond {{was made}} captain of England in 1938 when he {{achieved}} amateur status through {{being given a}} top job in a tyre company. This was {{the age of the}} [...] "Shamateur", when cricketers were given lucrative posts so that they would qualify for amateur status and captaincy of their county and country. He was with the RAF in South Africa during the war, but returned to play in 1945 and in the first full county season in 1946 made 1,783 runs (84.90) including six centuries in seven innings, making him easily the best batsman in England. Though the [...] at the MCC disliked having an ex-professional as England captain Hammond had no rivals to the post. On his arrival in Australia the news broke that he was divorcing his wife of 17 years to marry a South African beauty queen and the press had a field day. Hammond made centuries in his first two innings on the tour, 131 off Northam (with 19 fours and 4 sixes) and 208 against Western Australia, but suffered from fibrositis and let Yardley captain most of the early tour games. Hammond proved to be aloof and distant and at 43 was a generation older than the rest of his team, who held in him awe. Amateur captains used to readily consult their senior professional, but Hammond the ex-pro rarely sought anybody's advice, and [...] "sphinx-like marched from slip at one end to slip at the other, apparently, as Plum Warner wrote of him 'just letting the game go on'". He ordered his batsmen to stay in their crease and not attack the bowling and had his best bowlers running around the outfield between overs. In the Tests his highest Test score was only 37 and simply failed to concentrate as he used to; [...] "When I consider the hours I have spent against men like Grimmett and O'Reilly, never taking the slightest chance and patiently waiting for the loose ball to come along, I cannot understand why in 1946 I tried to hit spin bowlers off their length before I had been at the wicket ten minutes". Although averse to public speaking Hammond was very popular with the Australian public and was cheered whenever he appeared. One newspaper told its readers [...] "See him <b>while</b> <b>you</b> <b>can.</b> Your grandsons will feel you have let them down if you haven't seen him on their behalf". However, Hammond came [...] "as a cricket god, only to leave a failure both as a batsman and a captain". He retired on his return to England and moved to South Africa, where he remained detached from cricket until he took to the habit of visiting M.J.K. Smith's touring team just before he died in a car accident in 1965.|$|E
