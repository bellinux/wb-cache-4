Cyanide’s strong affinity for metals makes it favorable {{as an agent}} for metal finishing and treatment and also as a lixiviate for metal leaching, particularly gold. These technologies are environmentally sound but require safeguards to prevent accidental spills from contaminating soils as well as surface and ground waters. In this work, total cyanide, sodium, cadmium, iron, zinc and copper concentrations were determined in soil, cassava, hand dug wells and pipe-borne water from Bibiani, a gold mining town in the Western Region of Ghana. Total cyanide levels in soil ranged from 6. 04 to 26. 17 mg/kg and in water, from 2. 17 to 7. 83 mg/L. Total cyanide concentrations in raw cassava ranged from 82. 45 to 142. 91 mg/kg fresh <b>weight.</b> The <b>cooked</b> cassava had cyanide concentrations ranging from 6. 79 to 24. 91 mg/kg and the cassava peels, 360. 05 to 509. 51 mg/kg.

30|$|Agaricus bisporus (Lange) Sing is {{the most}} widely {{cultivated}} and most consumed edible mushroom with the highest yield in the world, accounting for about 25 % of the total world edible fungus production. Due to the short storage period of fresh A. bisporus, the main form of international trade is mainly canned processed products. During tank processing, fresh mushrooms are promptly pre-cooked to prevent mushrooms umbrella, and the <b>weight</b> of <b>cooked</b> mushrooms is 35 – 40 % {{lower than that of}} fresh mushrooms; the loss of weight goes to industrial wastewater—A. bisporus wastewater. In China, A. bisporus used for canned processing accounts for about 80 % of the total production of A. bisporus. About 30 % of A. bisporus production is lost to industrial wastewater every year. The mushroom pre-cooking liquid is a production wastewater with high BOD and COD content, of which the content of COD is 540.29  g/L, which is 13.07 times higher than the national three level emission standard. The direct discharge of pre-cooking liquid will cause environmental pollution, and wastewater treatment will increase the production cost (Huang et al. 2016); however, the water soluble nutrients can be extracted by pre-cooking fresh A. bisporus. The preboiled liquid of A. bisporus contains a variety of nutrients such as free protein, polysaccharides, mannitol, and mineral ions (Lin et al. 2016), so it {{can be used as a}} natural medium for the cultivation of certain beneficial bacteria or plants (Zhan et al. 2017).

The altitude of the experimental field was 178 m. The location has a continental climate with an average temperature 19. 7 °C in July and - 1. 7 °C in January, an average annual precipitations are 561 mm. The aim of this work was to evaluate the quality of white and wholegrain noodles made from winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown in ecological and integrated farming system. A split - plot design was used with two main treatments, ecological (ES) and integrated (IS) cropping systems. The ecological system was composed of a six course crop rotation: beans + alfalfa – alfalfa – winter wheat – peas – maize – spring barley. The integrated system consisted of the crop rotation: winter wheat – peas – winter wheat – maize – spring barley – alfalfa (3 years at the same plot). Subplots were fertilised (F) and unfertilised (N) variants. The fertilised variant in ES was based on 40 t of manure while the IS also received 40 t of manure plus synthetic fertilisers. Based on the reached results, winter wheat noodle qualitative parameters were significantly affected by farming system, fertilisation, forecrop and by external impacts of the weather. Noodle quality evaluated by cooking time, volume and <b>weight</b> of <b>cooked</b> noodles, noodle absorption and by cooking loss showed higher values {{of each of the}} cooking quality parameters of wholegrain noodles, it also applies to longer cooking time or higher cooking loss. Noodles from the ecological farming system, especially wholegrain noodles, have better quality than noodles from the winter wheat cultivated in integrated farming system.

After the meat load (2 g. kg- 1 body <b>weight</b> of <b>cooked</b> unsalted red meat), GFR increased by 26. 9 % (peak value) over baseline in healthy subjects and by 32 % in CRF patients. The acid-base status of the healthy subjects was in the normal range, whereas the CRF patients disclosed a slight metabolic acidosis. After a meat load, there was, in the healthy subjects, {{an increase in the}} filtered load of bicarbonate coupled to an enhanced tubular reabsorption and urinary excretion. The time course between bicarbonate load and urinary excretion was coincident. In CRF patients, the increase of bicarbonate tubular load after the meal was associated with an increase in tubular reabsorption but not in urinary excretion of this anion. The relationship between bicarbonate load and reabsorption was linear in both groups up to the highest filtered loads. Baseline titratable acidity (TA) and ammonium (NH 4 +) excretion (expressed per ml GFR) were increased in CRF patients as compared with control subjects, but no changes were found after the meat load in both groups in these experimental conditions. The data indicate that the renal tubules contribute to the maintenance of acid-base balance both in healthy subjects and in CRF patients by reabsorbing most of the additional bicarbonate load. The transient, but significant, increase in bicarbonate excretion observed in healthy subjects could be related to the increased tubular load of bicarbonate. In CRF patients, tubular bicarbonate reabsorption was more complete, possibly because of the stimulation of H+ secretion by the mild metabolic acidosis. TA and NH 4 + did not participate in tubular compensation of the increased buffer load...|$|R

The major difference among genotypes was in the sharpness of the peak, with some showing a very sharp peak while others showed a broad peak. This difference was related to time from onset of pasting to peak viscosity, and to stability ratio (holding viscosity/peak viscosity), which were also highly correlated (r = 0. 84, P < 0. 01) to each other. Stability ratio was also correlated to noodle firmness (r = 0. 95, P < 0. 01), rehydration (<b>cooked</b> <b>weight)</b> (r = - 0. 89, P < 0. 01), and swelling volume of the starch (r = - 0. 62, P < 0. 05).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to analyze the nutritional and sensory profiles of decorticated legumes (dhals) cooked in a microwave oven in comparison with pressure-cooked samples. Four dhals, namely Bengal gram (Cicer arietinum), green gram (Phaseolus aureus Roxb.), lentils (Lens esculenta) and red gram (Cajanus cajan), were selected for this study. <b>Cooked</b> <b>weight,</b> cooking time, water uptake and extent of sedimentation were the parameters used to determine the cooking quality. Samples were analyzed for their nutrient composition and in vitro protein and starch digestibility. The sensory attributes were measured using a ranking test and quantitative descriptive analysis (QDA). Microwave cooking required more time with a higher water uptake. The ranges of nutrients analyzed in 100 g of cooked samples were as follows: moisture (72. 1 - 77. 3 g), protein (21. 5 - 23. 2 g), fat (1. 0 - 6. 4 g), ash (1. 8 - 3. 5 g), iron (3. 0 - 5. 4 mg, calcium (37 - 59 mg), phosphorus (256 - 377 mg) and thiamine (0. 17 - 0. 41 mg). The cooking methods did not affect the nutrient composition of legumes except for thiamine, which was lost to a significant extent in microwave-cooked samples. Cooking altered the dietary fiber content of some dhals. The mean in vitro protein digestibility values of pressure- and microwave-cooked samples were 81. 0 and 75. 2 %, respectively. The in vitro starch and protein digestibility values of pressure-cooked samples were higher. The sensory evaluation of legume samples exhibited a significant difference in the overall quality of green gram in the ranking test, whereas varied responses were obtained for different dhals in the QDA...|$|R
30|$|According to {{a number}} of reports from China, {{alginates}} were widely involved in the formulations of Chinese dry noodles and fresh noodles. Generally, noodles with optimum quantity of alginates usually exhibited an increase in the <b>cooked</b> <b>weight,</b> a decrease in the cooking loss and significant increase in the cutting and tensile forces [77, 78]. Moreover, the noodles containing more alginate showed lower lightness and redness, while yellowness was increased. The optimum additive amount of alginates for different noodles was also investigated. Zhao et al. [78] found that the sodium alginate with the viscosity of 300  mPa. s was suitable for noodle making, and the optimum concentration was 0.2 – 0.25 %. Yang et al. [77] reported that the oat flour containing 0.3 % sodium alginate exhibited best quality in oat noodle making. As for the buckwheat flour with high dietary fiber (5 %), 4 % sodium alginate contributed to the best performance of buckwheat noodles [79]. According to the quantity variation of sodium alginate incorporated in different noodles, it is supposed that the optimum quantity of sodium alginate is partially depended on the gluten strength of mixed flour. Wheat flour had stronger gluten strength comparing with oat and buckwheat flour, hence lower quantity of sodium alginate was used in the noodle making. Conversely, relatively the higher quantity of sodium alginate was required for the noodle making using oat flour or buckwheat flour due to their weak gluten caused by lack of gluten proteins. Apart from application in noodle making, alginates, acting as an anti-staling agent, were also increasingly involved in the making of CSB. The results from the study of Sim et al. [30] suggest that at 0.2 % addition level, alginate is better than konjac glucomannan in delaying staling of CSB though slight reduction in spread ratio and specific volume were evident.|$|R

In our laboratory we have shown these heterocyclic amines are capable of producing both reverse and forward mutations in Salmonella bacteria and forward mutations in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO). We have also been able to show a statistically significant increase in mutations in the pancreas of the "mutamouse " following PhIP exposure. The pancreas also shows relatively high DNA binding compared to other organs in the mouse. The number and type of mutations depend on the repair capacity of the cells for both Salmonella and CHO. In Salmonella the mutations are primarily 2 -base deletions when the cells lack uvrB repair, but mutations are more complex (larger deletions and insertions) but lower in frequency when repair is functional. Efforts are now under way to assess specific sequence changes in the aprt gene in mutant CHO cells. - Environ Healt...|$|R
40|$|O caranguejo uÃÃ Ã um importante habitante dos manguezais que ocorre em quase todo o litoral brasileiro destacando-se pelo seu considerÃvel valor comercial. A carne Ã geralmente embalada em envoltÃrio plÃstico e seu beneficiamento Ã realizado muitas vezes de forma artesanal em locais nÃo licenciados pelo ServiÃo de InspeÃÃo Federal - SIF, sendo preparado sem o mÃnimo controle higiÃnico. No beneficiamento seguido por estes locais, antes do cozimento para retirada da carne, o abdÃmen do caranguejo Ã torcido com forÃa ou perfurado com objeto cortante, manualmente, para provocar a morte do animal, contribuindo para uma possÃvel contaminaÃÃo {{no local}} onde foi traumatizado. Foram utilizadas, durante os seis meses de experimento, duas amostras mensais de 50 caranguejos uÃÃ, adquiridos vivos, comercializados ao ar livre em Fortaleza-CearÃ. Neste trabalho pretende-se beneficiar a carne de caranguejo de acordo com as Boas PrÃticas de FabricaÃÃo (BPF), utilizando dois outros mÃtodos de abate: choque tÃrmico (CT) e choque elÃtrico com o Sistema de ImobilizaÃÃo e abate por choque elÃtrico (SIAC). Esta mÃquina paralisa os animais com a aplicaÃÃo de pulsos elÃtricos com controle de forÃa e tempo. Assim avaliou-se os rendimentos da carne extraÃda com os dois mÃtodos de abate e a perda de peso por cocÃÃo. Os rendimentos mÃdios totais de acordo com mÃtodo de abate, em cada mÃs do experimento, em termos percentuais apresentaram os seguintes valores respectivamente: CT - Peso animal in natura 25, 34; 23, 28; 24, 63; 25, 38; 26, 29; 26, 19 %, CT - Peso animal cozido 27, 18; 24, 81; 26, 32; 26, 99; 27, 81; 27, 74 %, SIAC - Peso animal in natura 26, 56; 26, 01; 26, 32; 25, 77; 27, 54; 26, 97 % e SIAC - Peso animal cozido 28, 35; 27, 77; 27, 69; 27, 19; 28, 95; 28, 21 %. Em relaÃÃo aos rendimentos mÃdios da carne extraÃda dos trÃs segmentos pereÃdos (PP), pinÃas ou quelas (PQ) e cefalotorax (C) separadamente os caranguejos abatidos na mÃquina SIAC apresentaram diferenÃas significativas no rendimento da carne extraÃda do segmento PQ o que pode ter favorecido seu melhor rendimento em relaÃÃo ao abate CT, tambÃm nÃo soltaram as patas durante o cozimento o que ocorreu algumas vezes com abate CT. JÃ a mÃdia de perda de peso por cocÃÃo de acordo com os mÃtodos de abate durante o experimento apresentou valores prÃximos, respectivamente CT - 6, 68; 6, 20; 6, 32; 5, 94; 5, 38; 5, 97 % e SIAC â 5, 26; 5, 29; 4, 97; 5, 22; 4, 91; 4, 43 % nÃo apresentando diferenÃas significativas entre os mÃtodos de abate, fenÃmeno causado provavelmente pela padronizaÃÃo do processo. The {{mangrove}} crab (Ucides cordatus) {{is an important}} resource of mangroves which occurs in almost all in the Brazilian coast and it is notable for its considerable commercial value. The meat is usually wrapped {{in plastic wrap and}} its treatment is in a handmade way, in places where are not licensed by the Federal Inspection Service (SIF) and without the minimum hygienic control. In these places the animalâs death, done by hand, contributes to a possible contamination of the meat. In this experiment were analized 50 crabs purchased live in the outdoor market in Fortaleza, Ceara which were used during the six months of the experiment, two monthly samples. This work intends to benefit the crab meat according to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), using two other methods of processing: heat shock (CT) and electric shock to the system of restraint and killed by electric shock (SIAC). This machine paralyzes the animal with the application of electric pulses with controlled force and time. Thus it was evaluated the yields of meat extracted with both methods of slaughter and loss of weight due to cooking. The total average yield according to the method of slaughter, each month of the experiment, presented in percentage terms the following values respectively: CT - animal fresh weight 25. 34, 23. 28, 24. 63, 25. 38, 26, 29, 26. 19 % CT - 27. 18 animal <b>cooked</b> <b>weight,</b> 24. 81, 26. 32, 26. 99, 27. 81, 27. 74 %, SIAC - animal fresh weight 26. 56, 26. 01, 26. 32, 25. 77, 27. 54, 26. 97 % and SIAC - animal <b>cooked</b> <b>weight</b> 28. 35, 27. 77, 27. 69, 27. 19, 28. 95, 28. 21 %. In relation to average yields of meat extracted from the three segments pereiopod (PP), forceps or chelae (PQ) and carapace (C) separately crabs killed on the machine SIAC showed significant differences in yield of meat obtained from the segment PQ which may have favored its best performance in relation to slaughter CT, did not lose their legs during cooking which sometimes occurred with CT slaughter. Finally, the mean weight loss by cooking according to the methods of slaughter during the experiment showed similar, respectively CT - 6. 68, 6. 20, 6. 32, 5. 94, 5. 38, 5. 97 % and SIAC - 5. 26, 5. 29, 4. 97, 5. 22, 4. 91, 4. 43 % without {{no significant difference between the}} methods of slaughter, a phenomenon probably caused by the standardization process...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} effects of added native tapioca starch; N and starch ester (starch acetate; A, starch phosphate; P, and acetylated distarch phosphate; PA) on the cooking characteristics and textural stability of frozen noodles. Physical and chemical analyses were done after the starches were differentiated based on noodle starch added at 10, 20 and 30 %. The research results showed that added of starch ester showed lower viscosity break down (BD), (p< 0. 05) and viscosity set back (SB), with the maximum decrease in the starch phosphate (BD values decreased from 110. 75 ± 2. 83 RVU to 63. 66 ± 5. 87 RVU; SB values decreased from 109. 22 ± 1. 51 RVU to 67. 00 ± 3. 86 RVU), but the set back value of acetylated distarch phosphate (PA) increased along {{with an increase in}} starch added. The starch added of starch phosphate showed increased peak viscosity (p< 0. 05) (increased from 255. 47 ± 2. 34 RVU to 291. 42 ± 0. 82 RVU), holding viscosity (increased from 144. 72 ± 0. 81 RVU to 227. 75 ± 5. 24 RVU), final viscosity (increased from 253. 94 ± 0. 97 RVU to 294. 75 ± 1. 38 RVU). The starch added of acetate showed decreased peak viscosity (decreased from 255. 47 ± 2. 34 RVU to 218. 39 ± 2. 55 RVU), final viscosity (decreased from 253. 94 ± 0. 97 RVU to 225. 42 ± 2. 01 RVU). For the swelling power, the starch added of native tapioca starch, starch acetate and starch phosphate showed increased swelling power (p< 0. 05), among which the starch phosphate showed the maximum increase (the swelling power increased from 14. 66 ± 0. 24 to 30. 40 ± 0. 35 at 95 ℃). Moreover, there were no changes in the swelling power of acetylated distarch phosphate. The results of the cooking characteristic of starch added of noodles at different starch levels showed that there was a weight gain in the starch added of starch (p< 0. 05), which could be caused by the increase in the swelling power of starch added. There was a decrease in the cooking loss of starch added, but there were no changes in the acetylated distarch phosphate noodle, instead there was a slight increase, which could be caused by short cooking time. The results of textural analysis of noodles showed that an increase in the various starch added, would decrease the hardness, chewiness, adhesiveness and tensile strength of the noodles. After the freeze-thaw cycles of the noodles, the thickness increased, while the hardness, chewiness, tensile strength and tensile distance decreased. The break down value showed a negative relationship (p< 0. 01) with the <b>cooked</b> <b>weight</b> gain of noodle and a positive relationship (p< 0. 05) with the hardness, chewiness, adhesiveness and tensile strength of noodle. The set back value showed a positive relationship (p< 0. 001) with the cooking loss of noodles and a negative relationship (p< 0. 05) with the Elasticity of noodle. The swelling power showed a positive relationship (p< 0. 05) with the cooking weight gain and cooking volume gain of noodles and a negative relationship (p< 0. 05) with the cooking loss of noodles. 本論文擬探討天然樹薯澱粉(Native tapioca starch；N) 及不同酯化修飾澱粉：醋酸酯化澱粉(Starch acetate；A) 、磷酸酯化澱粉(Starch phosphate；P) 與乙醯化磷酸二澱粉(Acetylated Distarch Phosphate；PA) 的添加對冷凍熟麵條烹煮特性及質地穩定性的影響。先將澱粉分別對麵粉添加 10 %、 20 %、 30 %三種比例後進行理化性分析，分析結果顯示，添加酯化修飾澱粉可顯著的(p< 0. 05) 降低黏度裂解值(Break Down；BD) 和黏度回昇值(Set Back；SB) ，以添加磷酸酯化澱粉(P) 的降幅最大， (BD值由 110. 75 ± 2. 83 RVU下降至 63. 66 ± 5. 87 RVU；SB值由 109. 22 ± 1. 51 RVU下降至 67. 00 ± 3. 86 RVU) ，但添加乙醯化磷酸二澱粉(PA) 黏度回昇值(SB) 則隨著添加量增加而增加黏度。添加磷酸酯化澱粉(P) 可顯著的(p< 0. 05) 提升尖峰黏度(由 255. 47 ± 2. 34 RVU上升至 291. 42 ± 0. 82 RVU) 、恆溫黏度(由 144. 72 ± 0. 81 RVU上升至 227. 75 ± 5. 24 RVU) 、最終黏度(由 253. 94 ± 0. 97 RVU上升至 294. 75 ± 1. 38 RVU) ；添加醋酸酯化澱粉(A) 可顯著的(p< 0. 05) 降低尖峰黏度(由 255. 47 ± 2. 34 RVU下降至 218. 39 ± 2. 55 RVU) 、最終黏度(由 253. 94 ± 0. 97 RVU下降至 225. 42 ± 2. 01 RVU) 。在膨潤力(Swelling Powder) 方面，添加天然樹薯澱粉(N) 、醋酸酯化澱粉(A) 和磷酸酯化澱粉(P) 均顯著增加膨潤力(p< 0. 05) ，其中以磷酸酯化澱粉(P) 增加的幅度最大(於 95 ℃時膨潤力由 14. 66 ± 0. 24 提升至 30. 40 ± 0. 35) ，另添加乙醯化磷酸二澱粉(PA) 的麵條粉，膨潤力無顯著改變。 將添加不同澱粉比例的麵粉製成麵條後進行烹煮特性分析與質地分析，烹煮特性分析結果顯示，澱粉之添加有顯著增加麵條煮麵增重率之趨勢(p< 0. 05) ，其造成的原因可能與澱粉添加後膨潤力增加有關；澱粉的添加會顯著降低麵條的煮麵損失率，但添加乙醯化磷酸二澱粉(PA) 的麵條無顯著降低，反而稍微增加，煮麵時間短可能是造成其增加的原因。熟麵條質地分析結果顯示，隨著各種澱粉添加量的增加，會降低麵條的硬度(Hardness) 、咀嚼性(Chewiness) 、附著度(Adhesiveness) 和抗拉強度(Tensile strength) 。麵條在冷凍-解凍循環後，厚度(Thickness) 會增加，硬度、咀嚼度、抗拉強度和抗拉距離會降低。 麵粉理化特性的黏度裂解值(BD) 與麵條煮麵增重率有顯著的負相關性(p< 0. 01) ，而與麵條硬度、咀嚼性、附著性和抗拉強度有顯著的正相關性(p< 0. 05) ；黏度回升值(SB) 與麵條的煮麵損失率有顯著的正相關性(p< 0. 001) ，而與麵條感官品評的彈性(Elasticity) 有顯著的負相關性(p< 0. 05) ；膨潤力與麵條的煮麵增重率和煮麵增容率有顯著的正相關性 (p< 0. 05) ，而與煮麵損失率有顯著的負相關性(p< 0. 05) 。摘 要	 1 目 錄	V 圖 次	VIII 表 次	X 前 言	 1 第一章、文獻整理	 2 一、冷凍麵條及其市場概況	 2 (一) 麵條(Noodles) 	 2 (二) 冷凍麵條之特性及種類	 3 (三) 冷凍麵條市場概況	 5 二、冷凍熟麵條之製備及質地特性	 7 (一) 冷凍麵條之製備	 7 (二) 冷凍熟麵條之質地特性	 7 (三) 冷凍麵條品質影響因子	 13 三、澱粉之介紹	 23 (一) 天然澱粉 (Native starch) 	 23 (二) 修飾澱粉 (Modified starches) 	 30 第二章、材料與方法	 39 一、實驗架構	 39 二、材料	 39 (一) 麵粉 (Wheat flour) 	 39 (二) 澱粉 (Starch) 	 39 (三) 鹽 (Salt) 	 39 三、實驗方法	 41 (一) 麵條粉理化特性分析	 41 (二) 麵條製備	 42 (三) 麵條烹煮特性分析	 43 (四) 麵條質地分析	 45 (五) 冷凍-解凍試驗(Freeze-Thaw cycles) 	 47 (六) 統計分析	 47 第三章、結果與討論	 48 一、酯化澱粉添加對麵粉理化性質之影響	 48 (一) 快速糊化黏度分析(Rapid viscosity analyzer, RVA) 	 48 (二) 示差熱掃瞄分析(Differential scanning calorimeter, DSC) 	 54 (三) 膨潤力(Swelling power) 	 56 (四) 溶解度 (Solubility) 	 57 (五) 凝膠質地(Gel texture) 	 58 二、酯化澱粉添加對麵條烹煮特性之影響	 67 (一) 烹煮時間(Cooking time) 	 67 (二) 煮麵損失率(Cooking loss) 	 67 (三) 煮麵增重率(Cooked weigh gain) 	 68 (四) 煮麵增容率(Cooked volume gain) 	 68 (五) 冷凍-解凍對麵條烹煮特性之影響	 68 三、酯化澱粉添加對麵條質地之影響	 73 (一) 質地剖面分析(Texture profile analysis, TPA) 	 73 (二) 抗拉強度(Tensile strength) 	 88 (三) 微細構造(SEM) 	 94 (四) 感官品評(Sensory evaluation) 	 94 四、麵條特性與澱粉特性之相關性	 100 (一) 澱粉理化特性與麵條烹煮特性之相關性	 100 (二) 澱粉理化特性與麵條質地之相關性	 100 (三) 麵條烹煮特性與麵條質地之相關性	 101 第四章、結論	 115 參考文獻	 116 附 錄	 12...|$|R
