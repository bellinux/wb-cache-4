5|$|Mysts story {{concerns}} {{an explorer}} named Atrus {{who has the}} ability to <b>write</b> <b>books</b> which serve as links to other worlds, known as Ages. This practice of creating linking books was developed by an ancient civilization known as the D'ni, whose society crumbled after being ravaged by disease. The player takes the role of an unnamed person referred to as the Stranger and assists Atrus by traveling to other Ages and solving puzzles. Over the course of the series Atrus writes a new Age for the D'ni survivors to live on, and players of the games set the course the civilization will follow.|$|E

5|$|After {{visiting the}} village of Annisa to see his dying sister Macrina, he {{returned}} to Nyssa in August. In 380 he travelled to Sebaste, {{in the province of}} Armenia Prima, to support a pro-Nicene candidate for the election to the bishopric. To his surprise, he himself was elected to the seat, perhaps due to the population's association of him with his brother. However, Gregory deeply disliked the relatively unhellenized society of Armenia, and he was confronted by an investigation into his orthodoxy by local opponents of the Nicene theology. After a stay of several months, a substitute was found - possibly Gregory's brother Peter, who was bishop of Sebaste from 381 - and Gregory returned home to Nyssa to <b>write</b> <b>books</b> I and II of Against Eunomius.|$|E

25|$|In 1881 Warfield wrote a joint article with A. A. Hodge on the {{inspiration}} of the Bible. It drew attention because of its scholarly and forceful defense of the inerrancy of the Bible. In many of his writings, Warfield attempted {{to demonstrate that the}} doctrine of Biblical inerrancy was simply orthodox Christian teaching, and not merely a concept invented in the nineteenth century. His passion was to refute the liberal element within Presbyterianism and within Christianity at large. Throughout his life, he continued to <b>write</b> <b>books</b> and articles, which are still widely read today.|$|E

In 1977 she moved to become Director of the Nursing Education Research Unit at Chelsea College of the University of London. She was also made an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons. She was also concerned with education and backed the reforms to reduce powers of Local Education Authorities in 1993, arguing for a more strongly religious element to teaching. Her background in sociology led her to <b>write</b> <b>books</b> on the subject for nurses, and she also co-wrote a book (Rape of Reason) attacking communist activity at the Polytechnic of North London in 1975. She was founding Chancellor of Bournemouth University.|$|E
25|$|Packard soon {{developed}} this basic premise into a manuscript titled The Adventures of You on Sugar Cane Island. He {{set out in}} 1970 to find a publisher but was rejected by nine publishing companies, causing him to shelve the idea. In 1975, {{he was able to}} convince Ray Montgomery, co-owner of Vermont Crossroads Press, to publish the book and it sold 8,000 copies, a large amount for a small local publishing house. The series was later marketed to Pocket Books, where it also sold well, but Montgomery believed that it would sell better if a bigger publisher could be found. After some discussion, Montgomery was able to make a contract for the series with Bantam Books. Packard and Montgomery were selected to <b>write</b> <b>books</b> for the series, including the contracting out of titles to additional authors.|$|E

25|$|In 1952, after Comet in Moominland and Finn Family Moomintroll {{had been}} {{translated}} into English, a British publisher asked if Tove Jansson {{would be interested in}} drawing comic strips about the Moomins. Jansson had already drawn a long Moomin comic adventure, Mumintrollet och jordens undergång ("Moomintrolls and the End of the World"), based loosely on Comet in Moominland, for the Swedish-language newspaper Ny Tid, and she accepted the offer. The comic strip Moomintroll, started in 1954 in the Evening News, a newspaper for the London area and London commuters (no longer in business). Tove Jansson drew 21 long Moomin stories from 1954 to 1959, writing them at first by herself and then with her brother Lars Jansson. She eventually gave the strip up because the daily work of a comic artist did not leave her time to <b>write</b> <b>books</b> and paint, but Lars took over the strip and continued it until 1975.|$|E
25|$|He {{came from}} a family of criminals: his father died when he was a child, and his mother died after being riddled by machine gun fire during a botched robbery attempt in his teenage years. He has three younger brothers, a set of {{triplets}} called Tim, Tom and Tumb, who are professional criminals and frequently try to use Bob as the scapegoat in their criminal schemes. Despite this, Bob refuses to follow the criminal career path and frequently berates his brothers for it, despite them being clearly more successful than Bob. He stopped berating them after they joined the TNT under The Great Caesar. Bob has a poetic side: he frequently tries to <b>write</b> <b>books</b> or poems that end up being rejected by even the worst publishers and/or ridiculed by other TNT members. He is mostly at odds with Number One for abnormally poor salary and his tyrannical attitude, and he is usually attacked by Number One with his stick when Bob provokes him. Despite this, {{he is one of the}} most trusted TNT agents.|$|E
25|$|Concerning {{the overall}} literacy, the sources allow us only a rough image. In total, only around 5% of all known written records of Christian Nubia {{come from the}} domains of Alodia. The thought of Ochala, that {{northern}} Nubia produced more sources mostly because of its proximity to Egypt should be rejected, not only because, as he also says, the north is way more studied than the south, {{but also because of}} the fact that Alodia housed the very heartland of the former Meroitic kingdom, a kingdom which was considerable literate. It seems plausible to suggest that like in other Medieval societies, the art of reading and writing was taught by the clerics to nobles and officials, but would the average population have had basic writing skills as well. In the case of Alodia, the latter can be attested by two types of sources: First, ostraca and other incised pottery as well as a few incised bricks predominantly coming from Soba and second, graffiti incised into former Meroitic monuments and sites. The graffiti from Meroitic sites have hitherto been largely ignored by scholars and therefore comprise only a fraction of all known written sources, but is a study in preparation now. Content-wise, all known inscriptions consist of personal names, names of saints (Often in the form of monograms) and short, predominantly religious, sentences. Except of graffiti, the Alodians also used to <b>write</b> <b>books,</b> which they did, according to the Fung Chronichle, in Greek, but commentated upon them in Nubian.|$|E
