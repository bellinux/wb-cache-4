Every year, the facility collects and processed only about 60% {{of the entire}} city's waste with landfilling and recycling services. The dumpsite uses rice hull ash as daily cover and odor control material for the waste collected in the area. Lingunan Controlled Dumpsite also conducted some limited waste segregation and resource recovery operations prior to burial of residual waste. In 2006, the controlled dumpsite was closed per MMDA order in 2003 and was subsequently converted into a sanitary landfill as directed by RA 9003.|$|E

[...] In 1983, during the tenure of governor Bob Kerrey, Nebraska had joined Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma to form the Central Interstate Low-Level Radioactive Waste Compact, under which a single disposal site would be constructed for all five states. [...] In 1987, {{the members of the}} compact voted 4–1 to place the facility in Nebraska. [...] At that time, Orr declared that she was not pleased with the choice, but had to acquiesce in the other states' decision. [...] U.S. Ecology, the company chosen to construct and operate the facility, considered a variety of sites in the state. [...] In January 1989, they announced that they had narrowed their choices to sites in Boyd, Nemaha, and Nuckolls counties; in January 1990, they declared that they had chosen the Boyd County location.|$|E

We had failed to secure sites for final disposal even before an accident occurred," [...] concluding that [...] "it's better {{to spend money on}} developing natural energy resources--citizens are more likely to agree with that idea--than using such large amounts of expenses and energy to advance such a feckless project [...]" [...] He explained that in August, he had visited a nuclear <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>facility</b> in Finland, where he learned that nuclear waste would have to be sealed up for 100,000 years. A poll by the Asahi Shimbun in November 2013 found that 54% of the public supported Koizumi's anti-nuclear statements.

Premiering on October 25, 1994, the first of five sequels entitled , was released with a plot surrounding a distinct Newcomer arriving on Earth attempting to lure the aliens back into a life of slavery. The film was written on a screenplay conceived by Andrew Schneider and Diane Frolov. [...] would follow on October 10, 1995 with a story revolving around a slaveship medical experiment involving a child who appears to be part human and part Newcomer. A side plot also involves the character of Sikes and a female Tenctonese exploring a relationship. Harry and Renee Longstreet were credited writers for the storyline. The franchise would see two more sequels in 1996. [...] was released on January 2, 1996, and dealt with a mysterious cult that uses mind-altering alien artifacts to lure Newcomer followers into a doomsday scenario. The film's plot is a tie-in to one of the television episodes titled: Generation to Generation that premiered on January 29, 1990. [...] was aired on November 12, 1996 and revolved around a story from which the detectives try to save their city from an alien threat originating from a <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>facility.</b> Racism was a key theme encountered by the character of Francisco. The fifth and final sequel would appear on July 29, 1997. , finds the detectives trying to stop a resistance group among the Newcomers trying to indoctrinate those among them into causing mayhem. A smaller plot is introduced with the younger Newcomer Buck, played by actor Sean Six, enlisting to become a police officer.

40|$|In {{this problem}} {{there is a}} set of <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>facilities,</b> a set of {{customers}} at which waste is collected and an unlimited number of homogeneous vehicles based at a single depot. Empty vehicles leave the depot and collect waste from customers, emptying themselves at the <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>facilities</b> as and when necessary. Vehicles return to the depot empty. We take into consideration time windows associated with customers, <b>disposal</b> <b>facilities</b> and the depot. We also have a driver rest period. The problem is solved heuristically. A neighbour set is defined for each customer as the set of customers that are close, but with compatible time windows. A procedure that attempts to fully utilise a vehicle is used to obtain an initial solution, with this initial solution being improved using an interchange procedure. We present two metaheuristic algorithms using tabu search and variable neighbourhood search that are based around the neighbour sets. We also present a metaheuristic based on variable neighbourhood tabu search, where the variable neighbourhood is searched via tabu search. Computational results are presented for publicly available waste collection problems involving up to 2092 customers and 19 <b>waste</b> <b>disposal</b> <b>facilities,</b> which indicate that our algorithms produce better quality solutions than previous work presented in the literature...|$|R
