He watches another {{man on the}} plane <b>who</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> following him. The man heads to the plane's bathroom, where he assembles a zip gun. However, {{when he comes back}} out, the airplane begins shaking and a bright light flashes outside, showing that the plane is encountering a UFO. The emergency door next to Max's seat is opened.|$|E

Meanwhile, Scully heads to a hotel to hide from the Bounty Hunter. Returning to the lab, she finds four more clones, who claim to be the last. Scully arranges for them to be transported to a safe place, but the Bounty Hunter follows her and watches. At her hotel room, Scully lets in a man <b>who</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Mulder, only to receive {{a phone call from the}} actual Mulder soon after.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Doggett, Reyes, and Scully investigate a series of bizarre killings {{that seem to be}} due to demonic possession but which Doggett believes is a hoax. The agents soon meet Josef Kobold (James Remar), a man <b>who</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> playing some sort of demonic game.|$|E

In attempt to get Billy to speak, Doggett keeps his backpack from him. This infuriates Lisa and leads Scully to question Doggett’s expertise in child abduction cases. Scully suggests that Billy is an alien abductee, but Doggett believes Ronald Purnell, a local , may {{have been involved in the}} boy's disappearance. Doggett questions Purnell, who expresses confusion when the agent suggests that he should meet Billy. As Doggett sits in his car, he pulls out a photo of his deceased son, Luke.|$|E

25|$|In 1801, Lockwood, {{a wealthy}} {{young man from}} the South of England who is seeking peace and recuperation, rents Thrushcross Grange in Yorkshire. He visits his landlord, Heathcliff, {{who lives in a}} remote moorland farmhouse, Wuthering Heights. There Lockwood finds an odd assemblage: Heathcliff <b>who</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a gentleman, but his manners are uncouth; the {{reserved}} mistress of the house who is in her mid-teens; and a young man <b>who</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a member of the family, yet dresses and speaks as if he is a servant.|$|E

25|$|The {{television}} series Alias prominently features the character Milo Rambaldi, a fictional prophet <b>who</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{an amalgam of}} Nostradamus and the non-prophetic but visionary inventor, artist, and genius Leonardo da Vinci. In the science fiction series First Wave, the protagonists use a previously unknown book of quatrains of Nostradamus to fight back against an alien invasion. Nostradamus was also a regular character on This Morning With Richard Not Judy, played by Emma Kennedy. Nostradamus appeared semi-regularly on the Warner Bros. animated series Histeria! as an eccentric red-bearded man in stereotypical wizard garb.|$|E
25|$|To {{the upper}} right of the horse, a frightened female figure, <b>who</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{witnessing}} the scenes before her, appears to have floated into the room through a window. Her arm, also floating in, carries a flame-lit lamp. The lamp is positioned {{very close to the}} bulb, and is a symbol of hope, clashing with the lightbulb. From the right, an awe-struck woman staggers towards the center below the floating female figure. She looks up blankly into the blazing light bulb. Daggers that suggest screaming replace the tongues of the bull, grieving woman, and horse. A dove is scribed on the wall behind the bull. Part of its body comprises a crack in the wall through which bright light (hope, or the outside world) can be seen. On the far right, a woman with arms raised in terror is entrapped by fire from above and below; her right hand suggests the shape of an airplane. A dark wall with an open door defines the right end of the mural.|$|E

[...] represents a new level of quality and ingenuity from Huang, <b>who</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> building on his now established visual style.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "chestburster" [...] {{effect was}} parodied in Mel Brooks' comedy Spaceballs. [...] Near the end, in a diner, John Hurt does a cameo {{appearance}} as a customer <b>who</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> suffering indigestion. [...] However, he {{turns out to}} have an [...] "alien" [...] in his gut, and moans, [...] "Oh, no...not again!" [...] The [...] "alien" [...] then does a song-and-dance, singing a line of [...] "Hello, Ma Baby", from the classic Warner Bros. cartoon One Froggy Evening.|$|E
500|$|Writer Joss Whedon {{says that}} [...] "Rhonda the Immortal Waitress" [...] {{was really the}} first {{incarnation}} of the Buffy concept, [...] "just the idea of some woman <b>who</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> completely insignificant who {{turns out to be}} extraordinary". This early, unproduced idea evolved into Buffy, an inversion of the Hollywood formula of [...] "the little blonde girl who goes into a dark alley and gets killed in every horror movie". Whedon wanted [...] "to subvert that idea and create someone who was a hero". He explained, [...] "The very first mission statement of the show was the joy of female power: having it, using it, sharing it".|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Cruz {{appeared}} in the Christmas film Noel as Nina, the girlfriend of Paul Walker's character and as Mia in the romantic drama, Head in the Clouds, set in the 1930s. Head in the Clouds performed poorly at the box office. For Head in the Clouds, Bruce Birkland of Jam! Canoe said, [...] "The story feels forced and the performances dreary, with the notable exception of Cruz, <b>who</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in a different film {{from the rest of}} the cast." [...] Desson Thompson of The Washington Post was more critical; his comment about the character's [...] "pronounced limp" [...] was that [...] "Cruz (hardly the world's greatest actress) can't even perform without looking fake". She also starred in Sergio Castellitto's melodrama Don't Move. Cruz, who learned Italian for the role, earned critical acclaim for her performance and won the David di Donatello. She was also awarded the European Film Award for Best Actress for the film in 2004.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} {{appearance}} of the Nightmaster, a fat man <b>who</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a closet homosexual gay basher repeatedly calls Jim Rook a [...] "cutie pie", compliments his hair, and grabs his girlfriend, saying (to Rook) [...] "And what? You gonna hit me with your purse?" [...] after which his friends start hitting Rook with a chair. The first obviously gay character featured by DC was Extraño, an effeminate Peruvian man whose name means [...] "strange" [...] in Spanish, created by Steve Englehart and Joe Staton, and appeared in Millennium and New Guardians in 1987. New Guardians was not successful, but during its short run it also featured one team member, Jet, contracting AIDS. The series was controversial, as several characters on the team were infected with HIV through the scratch of a character called the Hemo-Goblin. Many angry letters were printed {{in response to this}} misinformation about HIV transmission, along with some gay readers complaining that Extraño was too stereotypical. An official aftermath to Millennium, The Spectre (vol. 2) #11, depicted a [...] "mostly male and mostly gay" [...] AIDS rally. Several characters, including the Enchantress (describing them as [...] "filthy disgusting men") and a police helicopter pilot named Ed (screaming about [...] "fags") are influenced into attempting to crush the rally by a seven-headed spirit. Thanks to the actions of the Spectre, Doctor Fate, Deadman, Madame Xanadu (later herself revealed to be bisexual), and Ben Turner, the men are saved.|$|E
500|$|While Hurley {{had been}} able to command Friday's respect, {{it soon became clear that}} Andrews was unable to control him and that the Londoner disliked his new manager. Indeed, soon after moving to Cardiff, Friday {{appeared}} one day in Hurley's office at Elm Park asking to come back to Reading. [...] "He still called me boss", Hurley recalled. [...] "I can't play for that little bastard", Friday told Hurley, referring to Andrews. [...] "You're the one <b>who</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to get me right. Can I come back to you?" [...] Hurley replied that although he would be happy to have Friday back on the team, the club could not afford to repay the £28,000 transfer fee to Cardiff, so he would have to go back and continue playing there. Unhappy living so far from home, Friday began to travel back to London at weekends; he avoided paying rail fares by knocking on locked toilet doors and shouting, [...] "Tickets, please!", pretending to be the ticket inspector. When the occupant passed his ticket under the door to be checked, Friday would pick it up, walk off and use it for himself. Paul Went also recalled an incident during training when he had thrown a ball out from goal and accidentally hit Friday on the back of the head. A player standing near the forward started laughing, leading Friday to conclude that he had thrown the ball. Friday viciously punched the laughing player in the jaw, striking him with such force that he wore a neck brace for two weeks afterwards.|$|E
500|$|Casablanca Records {{commissioned}} a music video {{to be directed}} by Jake Nava, who previously worked {{in the same year}} with Britney Spears on her music video for [...] "My Prerogative" [...] (2004). The music video for [...] "Rumors" [...] premiered on October 14, 2004 and October 20, 2004 through Disney Channel and MTV. In the beginning of the video, Lohan is followed by paparazzi as she is entering her car. It is revealed that this is a Lindsay-look-alike, and that the real Lohan is entering another car to go to a club. The car comes to a stop, and she then steps into an elevator and sings the first verse of the song, while she is filmed by a CCTV camera in the elevator. The next sequence shows her running through a hallway, dressed up, before getting into the club. There, she dances in the crowd, where she takes a picture of one of the paparazzi herself to get back at him. In the next sequence, she is walking slowly through the club where she finds the man <b>who</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> her boyfriend. She takes a seat next to her lover and they begin kissing and touching each other, all the while being constantly filmed by cameras in the club. While Lohan sings the second chorus, she is trapped in a cage {{in the middle of the}} club and the whole crowd is watching her. After this Lohan is shown dancing in the club with her friends. At the end of the music video Lohan and her friends enter the top of a high-rise and perform a dance routine while helicopters are circling around them. Finally Lohan gets into a helicopter and escapes. In the end, she throws her camera away with all the pictures taken of her.|$|E

2500|$|The 2003 film Peter Pan briefly {{describes}} mermaids {{as different}} from those in traditional story books, but as [...] "dark creatures in touch with all things mysterious", and who will drown humans who get too close, but do not harm Peter <b>who</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{the only one who}} can speak the mermaid's language. They always seem to know Hook's whereabouts on the island at any given time and tell Peter.|$|E
2500|$|In the film, {{the motive}} of the ghosts is {{apparently}} to [...] "reclaim" [...] Jack (even though Grady expresses {{an interest in}} Danny's [...] "shining" [...] ability), <b>who</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a reincarnation of a previous caretaker of the hotel, {{as suggested by the}} 1920s photograph of Jack {{at the end of the}} film and Jack's repeated claims to have [...] "not just a deja vu". The film is even more focused on Jack (as opposed to Danny) than the novel.|$|E
