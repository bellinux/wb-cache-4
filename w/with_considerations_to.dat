30|$|Over {{the last}} four decades of research, {{numerous}} cell formation algorithms have been developed and tested, still this research remains of interest to this day. Appropriate manufacturing cells formation {{is the first step in}} designing a cellular manufacturing system. In cellular manufacturing, consideration to manufacturing flexibility and production-related data is vital for cell formation. The consideration to this realistic data makes cell formation problem very complex and tedious. It leads to the invention and implementation of highly advanced and complex cell formation methods. In this paper an effort has been made to develop a simple and easy to understand/implement manufacturing cell formation heuristic procedure <b>with</b> <b>considerations</b> <b>to</b> the number of production and manufacturing flexibility-related parameters. The heuristic minimizes inter-cellular movement cost/time. Further, the proposed heuristic is modified for the application of principal component analysis and Taguchi’s method. Numerical example is explained to illustrate the approach. A refinement in the results is observed with adoption of principal component analysis and Taguchi’s method.|$|E

The workpiece table has a working area of 100 x 100 mm and a nominal working range of 45 mum. The {{resolution of the}} workpiece table is less than 20 nm and the natural frequency is 579. 2 Hz. The rigidity of the workpiece table under the open loop condition is approximately 17 N/mum. Under the closed loop condition, the rigidity is better than 400 N/mum. The design of the workpiece table is presented together <b>with</b> <b>considerations</b> <b>to</b> achieve the high dynamic characteristics, where the maximum acceleration is up to 33 g (g is the acceleration of gravity).

40|$|Abstract: The {{reduction}} {{of carbon dioxide}} to useful chemicals has received {{a great deal of}} attention as an alternative to the depletion of fossil resources without altering the atmospheric CO 2 balance. As the chemical {{reduction of}} CO 2 is energetically uphill due to its remarkable thermodynamic stability, this process requires a significant transfer of energy. Achievements in the fields of photocatalysis during the last decade sparked increased interest in the possibility of using sunlight to reduce CO 2. In this review we discuss some general features associated with the photocatalytic reduction of CO 2 for the production of solar fuels, <b>with</b> <b>considerations</b> <b>to</b> be taken into account of the photocatalyst design, of the limitations arising from the lack of visible light response of titania, of the use of co-catalysts to overcome this shortcoming, together with several strategies that have been applied to enhance the photocatalytic efficiency of CO 2 reduction.
