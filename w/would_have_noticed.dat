Hitler-Barassi was photographed in 1993 {{at the opening}} night of Madame Butterfly, which was published on 4 April 1993; the book revealed the member to be Peter Minack, who later released a book of his own (Campaigning With Grant) in 2000, which was about the American Civil War. The book contains thin references to TISM. In interviews about his book, Minack revealed he was a teacher, his father fought in World War II for the Germans {{and that he is}} fanatical about the Richmond Football Club, explaining his stage moniker.|$|E

Charts for the Antarctic were not available to the pilot for planning purposes, being withheld until the flight was about to depart. The charts eventually provided, which were carried on the aircraft, were neither comprehensive enough nor large enough in scale to support detailed plotting.|$|E
25|$|On April 20, neighbors saw Frank Jr., age 6, lugging a {{pick and}} shovel out into South Troy Street and start digging. Upon inquiry, Frank {{said there had}} been a lot of {{construction}} on the street the day Elsie disappeared, and he had heard his parents discussing the possibility that she had fallen into a hole. As she struggled to climb out, she might have been buried under falling sand and gravel. Workers still fixing the street said that it was possible, but they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> immediately. Meanwhile, people in the West End and a woman in Kings, Illinois reported sightings of light-skinned girls traveling with gypsies.|$|E

25|$|Concerning {{the final}} , Fogg {{had thought it}} was one day later than it {{actually}} was, because he had forgotten this simple fact: during his journey, he had added a full day to his clock, at the rhythm of an hour per fifteen degrees, or four minutes per degree, as Verne writes. In fact, {{at the time and}} until 1884, the concept of a de jure International Date Line did not exist. If it did, he would have been made aware of the change in date once he reached this line. Thus, the day he added to his clock throughout his journey would be removed upon crossing this imaginary line. However, in the real world, Fogg's mistake would not have occurred because a de facto date line did exist. The UK, India and the US had the same calendar with different local times. He <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed,</b> when he arrived in San Francisco, that the local date was actually one day earlier than shown in his travel diary. As a consequence he could not fail to notice that the departure dates of the transcontinental train in San Francisco and of the China steamer in New York were actually one day earlier than his personal travel diary.|$|E
500|$|The men {{are called}} to the trench {{to prepare for the}} big push. There is a moment of hope when the British barrage lifts, but Blackadder reminds his colleagues that they have stopped only to avoid hitting their own men. Baldrick tells Blackadder that he has a plan to escape certain death, {{but for the first time}} in any series, does not call it a [...] "cunning plan". Blackadder replies Baldrick's idea will have to wait, but admits it couldn't fail to improve over his own plan to feign {{insanity}} because [...] "who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> another madman round here?" [...] The series concludes with Blackadder earnestly wishing his comrades good luck, and they charge over the top into thunderous machine-gun fire. The sequence enters slow motion as a slow piano version of the Blackadder theme is played. The series ends as the violent chaos of no man's land fades into a tranquil field of poppies, with only birdsong to be heard.|$|E
500|$|Gawain's {{refusal of}} the Lady Bertilak's ring has major {{implications}} {{for the remainder of}} the story. While the modern student may tend to pay more attention to the girdle as the eminent object offered by the lady, readers in the time of Gawain <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> the significance of the offer of the ring as they believed that rings, and especially the embedded gems, had talismanic properties similarly done by the Gawain-poet in Pearl. This is especially true of the lady's ring as scholars believe it to be a ruby or carbuncle, indicated when the Gawain-Poet describes it as a [...] "brygt sunne" [...] (line 1819), a [...] "fiery sun." [...] This red colour can be seen as symbolizing royalty, divinity, and the Passion the Christ, something that Gawain as a knight of the Round Table would strive for, but this colour could also represent the negative qualities of temptation and covetousness. Given the importance of magic rings in Arthurian romance, this remarkable ring would also have been believed to protect the wearer from harm just as Lady Bertilak claims the girdle will.|$|E

2500|$|Case Study 3: An {{elderly woman}} {{was found dead}} in March 2002 in her {{apartment}} in Germany. [...] Several insects were found on the body: larval Fannia canicularis (Little House Fly), larval Muscina stabulans (False Stable Fly), and adult Dermestes lardarius (Larder Beetle). [...] Fannia are drawn to feces and urine, and their presence is strong evidence of neglect. The woman probably had not changed clothes or bathed in some time. [...] She had developed pressure spots where her head had been resting on her chest for long periods of time. [...] If she had been taken care of, the caregiver <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> these wounds.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the third}} trial Alcala elected {{to act as}} his own attorney. He took the stand in his own defense, and for five hours played the roles of both {{interrogator}} and witness, asking himself questions (addressing himself as [...] "Mr. Alcala" [...] in a deeper-than-normal voice), and then answering them. During this bizarre self-questioning and answering session he told jurors, often in a rambling monotone, {{that he was at}} Knott's Berry Farm applying for a job as a photographer at the time Samsoe was kidnapped. He showed the jury a portion of his 1978 appearance on The Dating Game in an attempt to prove that the earrings found in his Seattle locker were his, not Samsoe's. Jed Mills, the actor who competed against Alcala on the show, told a reporter that earrings were not yet a socially acceptable accoutrement for men in 1978. [...] "I had never seen a man with an earring in his ear", he said. [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> them on him".|$|E

2500|$|The catchphrase [...] "I have a cunning plan" [...] {{made its}} first {{appearance}} in the pilot episode, {{but it is not}} regularly used until the third series; Blackadder had mentioned the phrase twice in the first series and Baldrick once. Baldrick had also claimed to have [...] "a plan" [...] in a [...] "cunning" [...] voice on one occasion in Blackadder II. In the final episode of the last series, Blackadder Goes Forth, Baldrick announces that he has a cunning plan to save the main characters from [...] "going over the top", although it is never revealed what this plan might be (other than that it is [...] "as cunning as a fox who's just been appointed Professor of Cunning at Oxford University"). Blackadder, perhaps realising he cannot postpone going into battle (and certain death) indefinitely, dismisses it, telling Baldrick [...] "Whatever it was, I'm sure it was better than my plan {{to get out of here}} by pretending to be mad. I mean, who <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> another madman around here?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Médecins Sans Frontières said no Taliban {{fighters were}} in the compound. Christopher Stokes, general {{director}} of Médecins Sans Frontières, {{said in a statement}} late 4 October 2015: [...] "MSF is disgusted by the recent statements coming from some Afghanistan government authorities justifying the attack on its hospital in Kunduz. These statements imply that Afghan and U.S. forces working together decided to raze to the ground a fully functioning hospital– with more than 180 staff and patients inside– because they claim that members of the Taliban were present. This amounts to an admission of a war crime." [...] Stokes said, [...] "If there was a major military operation going on there, our staff <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed.</b> And that wasn't the case when the strikes occurred." [...] On 5 October, the organization released a statement saying, [...] "Their [...] description of the attack keeps changing -- from collateral damage, to a tragic incident, to now attempting to pass responsibility to the Afghanistan government...There can be no justification for this horrible attack." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prosecutors {{later called}} a Japanese woman, also a student, {{who had been}} raped four months before St. Guillen's death {{in a manner similar}} to that of the 2005 Woodard case for which Littlejohn was convicted. According to one Daily News article, she testified that Littlejohn had taped her face [...] "almost exactly like St. Guillen's." [...] David, who objected to both Woodard's and the Japanese woman's testimonies, {{verbally}} attacked the second victim's inability to identify Littlejohn in a lineup, stating: [...] "My client has scars on his face and a tattoo that's very noticeable under his eye and that's something that one would expect that she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> and had them put either in the sketch or at least mentioned it". [...] While Littlejohn had not been charged in the Japanese student's attack, prosecutors insisted there was [...] "compelling proof" [...] that he was her attacker, based on the DNA evidence from the T-shirt and the manner in which she was attacked, similar to Woodard and St. Guillen.|$|E

2500|$|As counterpoint, Twain's {{essay on}} [...] "The Literary Offenses of Fenimore Cooper" [...] offers a much kinder view of Indians. [...] "No, other Indians <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> these things, but Cooper's Indians never notice anything. Cooper thinks they are {{marvelous}} creatures for noticing, {{but he was}} almost always in error about his Indians. There was seldom a sane one among them." [...] In his later travelogue Following the Equator (1897), Twain observes that in colonized lands all over the world, [...] "savages" [...] have always been wronged by [...] "whites" [...] in the most merciless ways, such as [...] "robbery, humiliation, and slow, slow murder, through poverty and the white man's whiskey"; his conclusion is that [...] "there are many humorous things in this world; among them the white man's notion that he is less savage than the other savages". In an expression that captures his Indian experiences, he wrote, [...] "So far as I am able to judge nothing has been left undone, either by man or Nature, to make India the most extraordinary country that the sun visits on his rounds. Where every prospect pleases, and only man is vile." ...|$|E
