It features American country singer-songwriter Vince Gill. The song {{is set in a}} [...] "drowsy, take-it-easy beat" [...] which is composed of a layer of Clarkson's and Gill's soulful harmonies. The song begins with a breezy soft-rock tune. In the first verse, Clarkson sings [...] "I see the way you’re looking at me / Baby know I’m feeling it too / <b>We</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> light up every candle / Move from room to room" [...] which was ensued by the sound of Gill's guitar.

Writer Paul Cornell, discussing continuity errors, opines that the modern programme's Time War can explain away (or retcon) such discontinuities, giving the example of Earth's different destructions in The Ark (1966) and [...] "The End of the World" [...] (2005).
