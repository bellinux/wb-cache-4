In principle, new <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> project construction for a region {{shall not be}} arranged if the <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> curtailment is more than 20 % of the total <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> to be generated. <b>Wind</b> <b>power</b> curtailment will not only affect the level of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> development and the utilization of clean energy, but also will reduce the wind farm investment income. Application of an energy storage system can coordinate a grid to accommodate <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> maximally. Furthermore, energy storage device can absorb the renewable generation in “off peak” load period, and conduct the peak shaving in “peak” load period.

30|$|Reasonable {{modeling}} of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> {{is the key}} {{for the establishment of}} the probabilistic production simulation in <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> integrated power system. In the current study, the {{modeling of}} <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> can be divided into a deterministic model and a random model. <b>Wind</b> <b>power</b> model in [11] is the deterministic model. Based on the wind speed sequence, <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> is obtained by the function relation between <b>power</b> and <b>wind</b> speeds. Here the <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> sequence is separated from the time-series load curve. The deterministic method cannot reflect the randomness of <b>wind</b> <b>power.</b> Random modeling of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> mainly includes the multiple-state model and Monte Carlo simulation method. However, Monte Carlo method has the disadvantage of taking too long to calculate. The multiple-state model can better reflect the randomness of <b>wind</b> <b>power,</b> but it uses one probability distribution of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> in all periods of time, which means that <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> is supposed to have the same volatility in any period of time. In fact, the probability distribution of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> is different from time to time. Therefore, the model needs to be further improved. For this reason, a multiple-period multiple-state model is proposed based on the multiple-state model in this paper.|$|R
30|$|Based on {{the theory}} of UGF, power system {{probabilistic}} production simulation considering <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> is proposed in this paper. The method {{is based on the}} time-series of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> and load, thus the method can reflect the time-varying characteristics of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> and load. In addition, taking the planned maintenance of generators into account, it can accurately describe the actual operation. <b>Wind</b> <b>power</b> modeling is the basis of the algorithm for probabilistic production simulation of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> integrated power system. Multiple-period multiple-state model is adopted in this paper for its characteristic of well-reflecting the randomness and volatility of <b>wind</b> <b>power.</b> The proposed method considers the pollutant emission in the process of power system probabilistic production simulation, and is capable of assessing <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> accommodation as well as achieving the probability and expectations of <b>wind</b> <b>power</b> curtailment.
