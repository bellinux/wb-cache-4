25|$|Nietzsche {{considered}} a free spirit {{to be the}} embodiment of a transvaluation of all values. Prior to Nietzsche's time, he claimed, the scientific method of searching for truth and knowledge was met with scorn and derision. A quiet, cautious, modest manner was seen with contempt. Our present modesty compels us to recognize man's derivation from animals, not divinities. Also, we know that man is not superior to other animals. By reducing man to a mere machine, devoid of free <b>will,</b> <b>we</b> have learned much about his physiology. Will is now {{known to be a}} necessary reaction to a stimulus. Consciousness and spirit derive from instinct.|$|E
500|$|In construing {{the concept}} of {{equality}} in Article 12, the Court held that equality {{does not mean that}} all persons are to be treated equally, but simply that all persons in like situations will be treated alike. Chief Justice Yong Pung How arrived at this conclusion by considering the history that underpinned the notion of equality. The Court traced the origin of Article 12 back to the 40th article of the Magna Carta which reads, [...] "To none <b>will</b> <b>we</b> sell, to none <b>will</b> <b>we</b> deny, to none <b>will</b> <b>we</b> delay right or justice." ...|$|E

500|$|In the 1998 {{decision}} Public Prosecutor v. Taw Cheng Kong, the Court of Appeal {{regarded the}} concept of equality {{as a component of}} the wider doctrine of the rule of law, and traced its origin to the 40th article of the Magna Carta of 1215 which states: [...] "To none <b>will</b> <b>we</b> sell, to none <b>will</b> <b>we</b> deny, to none <b>will</b> <b>we</b> delay right or justice." [...] Article 12(1) of the Constitution bears a strong resemblance to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which prohibits any state from denying [...] "to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws", and to Article 14 of the Constitution of India which bars the state from denying [...] "to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India". Article 12(1) is identical to Article 8(1) of the Constitution of Malaysia, from which it was adopted following Singapore's independence from Malaysia in 1965.|$|E

[...] Article 9(1) is similar, but by no means identical, to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution which prohibits any state from denying [...] "any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law", and to Article 21 of the Constitution of India which states: [...] "No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law."

500|$|The {{resolution}} to this isolation and ineffectiveness is speaking out: restoring {{the voices of}} the people of Sunnydale. Shade states that this facet of the episode gives it a political overtone. Noel Murray from The A.V.

[...] Authority figures in the series, such as the school principal, the mayor's office, and the Sunnydale Police Department, repeatedly either abet the town's endemic evil or choose not to hear about it. During [...] "Hush", at Giles' apartment the Scoobies listen to a newscaster reporting that authorities in the town attribute the silence to a flu vaccine gone awry, causing mass laryngitis. Wilcox writes, [...] "ow many times <b>will</b> <b>we</b> see those in power maintain such a silence while evil proceeds?
