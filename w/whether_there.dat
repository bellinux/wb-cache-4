5|$|The Znám {{problem is}} closely related to Egyptian fractions. It is known that there are only finitely many {{solutions}} for any fixed k. It is unknown <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> are any solutions to Znám's problem using only odd numbers, and there remain several other open questions.|$|E
5|$|The new Congress met for a {{few weeks}} in March 1867, then adjourned, leaving the House Committee on the Judiciary behind, charged with {{reporting}} back to the full House <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> were grounds for Johnson to be impeached. This committee duly met, examined the President's bank accounts, and summoned members of the Cabinet to testify.|$|E

5|$|Today, the {{majority}} of all subway delays are caused by signal problems. Whenever a track circuit stops working, all of the signals which are affected by it turn red, as it is uncertain <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> is a train in that section, and the system properly reverts to a safe state.|$|E
5|$|Wheeler {{presented}} the {{bill on the}} floor of the House of Representatives on April 6, 1918. He was quizzed by North Carolina's Claude Kitchin, who asked <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> had been a unanimous recommendation by the committee, whether McAdoo and Baker had approved the bill, and <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> was precedent for a half dollar in honor of a state's centennial (there was not). Wheeler reassured Kitchin as to the unanimity of the committee, and the approval by the officials, but did not answer the centennial question definitively, instead citing instances of prior commemorative issues (the Louisiana Purchase Exposition dollar and the Panama-Pacific commemorative coins). Ashbrook intervened, assuring Kitchin that his committee had unanimously approved it. Kitchin had no more questions, and the House approved the bill without a recorded vote.|$|E
5|$|A second {{reservoir}} {{was built}} around 1860 in Brown Cove, between Swirral Edge and Lower Man, {{along with one}} further down the valley in Keppel Cove. These provided water to generate hydroelectric power for the lead mine. The dam in Keppel Cove is still in place, but water now leaks through its base. The remains of the dam in Brown Cove can be seen, but again water leaks freely through it. It is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> ever was a natural tarn in Brown Cove. Guidebook writers before 1860 refer only to Keppel Cove Tarn {{to the north of}} Swirral Edge.|$|E

5|$|A {{year after}} he took office, Bruce began {{investigating}} <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> would be interest in building a religious center and chapel complex at the school. After several years of negotiations with the various religious denominations which had operated on and off campus, Bruce engineered a consensus that the university would build a center based {{on the model of}} the Armed Forces Base Chapel. The new religious center would have a single chapel which would be shared by all of the groups, and office space for each group. The center opened in 1965 and was named for Bruce.|$|E
5|$|An extinct {{relative}} of the fossa was described in 1902 from subfossil remains and recognized as a separate species, Cryptoprocta spelea, in 1935. This species was larger than the living fossa (with a body mass estimate roughly twice as great), but otherwise similar. Across Madagascar, people distinguish two kinds of fossa—a large fosa mainty ("black fossa") and the smaller fosa mena ("reddish fossa")—and a white form {{has been reported in}} the southwest. It is unclear whether this is purely folklore or individual variation—related to sex, age or instances of melanism and leucism—or <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> is indeed more than one species of living fossa.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reason that}} was put forward by Jayakumar to justify a limited role by the {{judiciary}} was that the judicial process is unsuitable for deciding preventive detention issues. Persons who are potential threats to national security may act covertly, hindering the collection of evidence to secure a conviction in a court trial. By its nature, however, preventive detention is a precautionary measure and involves making decisions on limited information to prevent threats to national security from materializing. Jayakumar said that the court is ill-equipped to determine <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> are suspicious circumstances which justify pre-emptive action. Tham agrees with this view, but argues that it applies only where the courts review the exercise of executive power. He distinguishes the objective test applied in Chng Suan Tze from the situation mentioned by Jayakumar, since the court is only interested in <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> is a national security issue involved.|$|E

5|$|At {{the request}} of the Presbytery of Paisley the Scottish Privy Council set up a {{commission}} to investigate the case. Under the chairmanship of Lord Blantyre, the hearing opened on 5February 1697. The commission's task was to decide <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> was a prima facie case against those accused by Shaw before they were committed for trial.|$|E
5|$|Danny K. Davis {{running for}} Chicago mayor in the Democratic primary {{scheduled}} for February 26, 1991, made police brutality and excessive force {{an issue in}} the campaign. He sought an independent citizens' review of the police department. On January 28, 1991, Amnesty International called for an investigation into police torture in Chicago. After Mayor of Chicago Richard M. Daley seemed reluctant to initiate an investigation, his opponent Davis questioned <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> was a police and city coverup. Eventually, after pressure by citizens' organizations and anti-brutality organizations, the police department resumed an internal investigation.|$|E
5|$|During Sophia's lifetime, {{there were}} various rumours about her alleged incestuous {{relationship}} with her brother, Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, who later became the King of Hanover. The Prince Regent supposedly warned his sisters not to be alone {{in the same room}} with the Duke, and Cumberland was deeply unpopular with the British people. It is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> was truth to these rumours or whether they were circulated by the Duke's numerous political enemies.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, in Fong Thin Choo, the High Court {{expressed}} {{the view that}} under regulation 12(6) of the Customs Regulations 1979, the fact that goods had not been exported from Singapore was a precedent fact to the customs officer's power to require {{the owner of the}} goods to pay customs duty. Therefore, the Court had to decide whether the customs officer's decision was justified by the evidence, and not merely <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> was some evidence on which he could reasonably have reached his decision. However, the Court did not pursue the point since the applicant had not argued the case on this basis.|$|E
5|$|Librarians at Valley Library {{began using}} text {{messaging}} in March 2010 {{to communicate with}} some library patrons, and earlier started to loan out Amazon's Kindle reader. In April, the school started allowing students to use the library 24-hours-a-day from Sunday through Thursday to test <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> was enough demand to allow 24-hour access on a permanent basis. The program {{was sponsored by the}} Associated Students of Oregon State University and paid for by university technology funds, and was {{due in part to the}} closure of some computer labs that had been 24-hour study areas.|$|E
5|$|On 18 September, a {{preliminary}} enquiry {{in a district}} court was held to determine <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> was sufficient evidence for a trial to proceed. The magistrate overseeing the enquiry ordered Martin to stand trial for Gerard Lowe's murder on 2 October after hearing statements from 39 witnesses, and looking at more than 100 exhibits and 100 photographs that the prosecution had prepared as evidence.|$|E

5|$|On {{appeal to}} the Court of Appeal, three issues were raised. The first issue was whether the plaintiffs (appellants) had the {{requisite}} locus standi. The second was <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> had been an inordinate delay on the appellants' part in pursuing the matter in court. The third issue is the most significant, namely, whether the acquisition of the temple property violated Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, type of leisure {{activity}} is substantially {{influenced by the}} individual's immediate situation—whether he has a family, <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> are recreational facilities nearby, and age. Early family influences, particularly involving the more social leisure activities, can be profound. The type of leisure activity also depends on the individual's current place in the life cycle.|$|E
5|$|One type of inter-cellular {{communication}} by {{a molecular}} signal is called quorum sensing, which serves {{the purpose of}} determining <b>whether</b> <b>there</b> is a local population density that is sufficiently high that it is productive to invest in processes that are only successful if large numbers of similar organisms behave similarly, as in excreting digestive enzymes or emitting light.|$|E
