5|$|Hurricane John was the {{eleventh}} named storm, seventh hurricane, and fifth major hurricane of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season.

Eyewall replacement cycles and land interaction <b>with</b> <b>western</b> Mexico weakened the hurricane, and John made landfall on southeastern Baja California Sur with winds of 110mph (180km/h) on September 1. It slowly weakened as it moved northwestward through the Baja California peninsula, and dissipated on September 4. Moisture from the remnants of the storm entered the southwest United States.|$|E

Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold, taxpayers paid their government bills in silver, while international creditors demanded payment in gold, resulting in a depletion of the nation's gold supply.|$|E

He has been the subject of several biographies and fictionalized portrayals.|$|E
