40|$|To reduce {{emissions}} of carbon dioxide, alternative sources for energy production have been adopted in high extent, e. g. biomass. However, since biomass contains higher concentrations of alkali metals and heavy metals compared to fossil fuels [1], corrosion problems e. g. on the <b>waterwalls</b> in biomass fired boilers occur in larger extent. In this work, the corrosion behavior of the low alloyed steel Fe- 2. 25 Cr- 1 Mo, used in <b>waterwalls</b> due to its economical advantage and mechanical properties, in presence of low amounts of ZnCl 2 at 300 – 400 °C is investigated. Laboratory experiments were carried out in a tube furnace in wet atmosphere containing 5 % O 2, 40 % H 2 O in N 2, with exposure times up to 168 h. Prior exposures, sample coupons were cleaned, polished, dried and deposited with 0. 1 mg ZnCl 2 /cm 2. After exposure, the coupons were analyzed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and X-ray diffraction (XRD).

In the presence of ZnCl 2, a local corrosion attack concentrated to the deposits was observed matching the composition of ZnO, the spinel Fe 2 ZnO 4 and iron oxides. 1 and 24 h exposure yield a mass loss, partly explained by evaporation of solvent and chlorine.

40|$|Abstract. Inconel 625 is {{utilised}} in both biomass {{and waste}} incineration plants in Denmark. In both cases, the performance is good however the morphology of corrosion attack is different which indicates different corrosion mechanisms. In {{waste incineration plants}} there is general attack and shallow pitting, {{and in some cases}} dendritic attack especially on the fins of <b>waterwalls.</b> The dendritic attack is in the dendritic core. The presence of pits or dendritic attack is linked to the temperature of the metallic surface and the molten salt composition. In a woodchip biomass plant, chromium depletion was observed {{on the surface of the}} weld overlay leaving behind a nickel and molybdenum rich porous structure. The corrosion attack was not related to the dendritic microstructure of the weld. In two straw-fired biomass plants, co-extruded Sanicro 63 (alloy 625 type) as well as Inconel 625 weld overlay revealed the same type of attack, again chromium depletion. This indicates that the corrosion mechanism in woodchip and straw power plants are similar. Another interesting result in straw-fired boilers was that Nibas welds (alloy 625 composition) could provoke excessive corrosion in adjacent 18 - 8 stainless steels indicating a galvanic reaction. The corrosion mechanisms observed in each case are discussed in relation to temperature and corrosive environment...|$|R

40|$|Corrosion probes {{are being}} {{developed}} and combined with an existing measurement technology to provide a tool for assessing the extent of corrosion of metallic materials on the fireside in coal-fired boilers. The successful development of this technology will provide power plant operators the ability to (1) accurately monitor metal loss in critical regions of the boiler, such as <b>waterwalls,</b> superheaters, and reheaters; and (2) use corrosion rates as process variables. In the former, corrosion data {{could be used to}} schedule maintenance periods and in the later, processes can be altered to decrease corrosion rates. The research approach involves laboratory research in simulated environments that will lead to field tests of corrosion probes in coal-fired boilers. Laboratory research has already shown that electrochemically-measured corrosion rates for ash-covered metals are similar to actual mass loss corrosion rates. Electrochemical tests conducted using a potentiostat show the corrosion reaction of ash-covered probes at 500 ?C to be electrochemical in nature. Corrosion rates measured are similar to those from an automated corrosion monitoring system. Tests of corrosion probes made with mild steel, 304 L stainless steel (SS), and 316 L SS sensors showed that corrosion of the sensors in a very aggressive incinerator ash was controlled by the ash and not by the alloy content. Corrosion rates in nitrogen atmospheres tended to decrease slowly with time. The addition of oxygen-containing gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide to nitrogen caused a more rapid decrease in corrosion rate, while the addition of water vapor increased the corrosion rate...|$|R
40|$|A 3 -dimensional {{model for}} the heat {{transfer}} in the furnace of a fluidized bed boiler is presented. The model, {{which is part of}} a comprehensive modeling work for large-scale CFB boilers, describes separately the convective and radiative heat transfer mechanisms at different heat extraction surfaces in the furnace (<b>waterwalls,</b> wing walls and division walls). The focus of the paper is on the heat transfer in the furnace, but the heat balance closure at a unit level including the return leg is also treated. Modeled data are compared to measurements from CFB boilers at two different scales: in the Chalmers 12 MWth research boiler and in a large scale boiler of about 300 MWth. Modeled and measured data generally show a good agreement. Since convective heat extraction depends strongly on the local properties of the solids flow, 3 D modeling of the convective heat transfer requires other expressions than those found in literature (which are typically. based on cross-sectional averaged solids concentration). In regions with low solids concentration (upper part of furnace), the radiative heat transfer is significantly influenced from regions several meters away from the heat extraction surface. Thus, in the description of the radiative heat transfer, optical factors accounting for the absorption in the gas-solids suspension are used. The model results reveal the importance of the exchange of radiative heat between the upflowing core and the downflowing wall layers. In addition, the importance of the fluid dynamics (wall layer flow properties, local solids flow properties such as the backflow effect and corner effects,) on the heat transfer is discussed with help of the model presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of the furnace and heat recovery area design and analysis task of the Conceptual Design of Oxygen-Based PC Boiler study is to optimize the location and design of the furnace, burners, over-fire gas ports, and internal radiant surfaces. The furnace and heat recovery area were designed and analyzed using the FW-FIRE and HEATEX computer programs. The furnace is designed with opposed wall-firing burners and over-fire air ports. Water is circulated in the furnace by natural circulation to the <b>waterwalls</b> and divisional wall panels. Compared to the air-fired furnace, the oxygen-fired furnace requires only 65 % of the surface area and 45 % of the volume. Two oxygen-fired designs were simulated: (1) without over-fire air and (2) with 20 % over-fire air. The maximum wall heat flux in the oxygen-fired furnace is more than double that of the air-fired furnace due to the higher flame temperature and higher H{sub 2 }O and CO{sub 2 } concentrations. The coal burnout for the oxygen-fired case is 100 % due to a 500 F higher furnace temperature and higher concentration of O{sub 2 }. Because of the higher furnace wall temperature of the oxygen-fired case compared to the air-fired case, furnace water wall material was upgraded from carbon steel to T 91. The total heat transfer surface required in the oxygen-fired heat recovery area (HRA) is 25 % less than the air-fired HRA due to more heat being absorbed in the oxygen-fired furnace and the greater molecular weight of the oxygen-fired flue gas. The HRA tube materials and wall thickness are practically {{the same for the}} air-fired and oxygen-fired design since the flue gas and water/steam temperature profiles encountered by the heat transfer banks are very similar...|$|R

40|$|Forced outages and boiler {{unavailability}} of coal-fired fossil {{plants is}} most often caused by fire-side corrosion of boiler <b>waterwalls</b> and tubing. Reliable coatings are required for Ultrasupercritical (USC) application to mitigate corrosion since these boilers will operate {{at a much higher}} temperatures and pressures than in supercritical (565 C {at} 24 MPa) boilers. Computational modeling efforts have been undertaken to design and assess potential Fe-Cr-Ni-Al systems to produce stable nanocrystalline coatings that form a protective, continuous scale of either Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } or Cr{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }. The computational modeling results identified a new series of Fe- 25 Cr- 40 Ni with or without 10 wt. % Al nanocrystalline coatings that maintain long-term stability by forming a diffusion barrier layer at the coating/substrate interface. The computational modeling predictions of microstructure, formation of continuous Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } scale, inward Al diffusion, grain growth, and sintering behavior were validated with experimental results. Advanced coatings, such as MCrAl (where M is Fe, Ni, or Co) nanocrystalline coatings, have been processed using different magnetron sputtering deposition techniques. Several coating trials were performed and among the processing methods evaluated, the DC pulsed magnetron sputtering technique produced the best quality coating with a minimum number of shallow defects and the results of multiple deposition trials showed that the process is repeatable. scale, inward Al diffusion, grain growth, and sintering behavior were validated with experimental results. The cyclic oxidation test results revealed that the nanocrystalline coatings offer better oxidation resistance, in terms of weight loss, localized oxidation, and formation of mixed oxides in the Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 } scale, than widely used MCrAlY coatings. However, the ultra-fine grain structure in these coatings, consistent with the computational model predictions, resulted in accelerated Al diffusion from the coating into the substrate. An effective diffusion barrier interlayer coating was developed to prevent inward Al diffusion. The fire-side corrosion test results showed that the nanocrystalline coatings with a minimum number of defects have a great potential in providing corrosion protection. The coating tested in the most aggressive environment showed no evidence of coating spallation and/or corrosion attack after 1050 hours exposure. In contrast, evidence of coating spallation in isolated areas and corrosion attack of the base metal in the spalled areas were observed after 500 hours. These contrasting results after 500 and 1050 hours exposure suggest that the premature coating spallation in isolated areas {{may be related to the}} variation of defects in the coating between the samples. It is suspected that the cauliflower-type defects in the coating were presumably responsible for coating spallation in isolated areas. Thus, a defect free good quality coating is the key for the long-term durability of nanocrystalline coatings in corrosive environments. Thus, additional process optimization work is required to produce defect-free coatings prior to development of a coating application method for production parts...|$|R
40|$|Compared {{to the use}} of {{traditional}} fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas), combustion of biomass and waste fuels has several environmental and economic advantages for heat and power generation. However, biomass and waste fuels might contain halogens (Cl, Br, F), alkali metals (Na, K) and heavy metals (Zn, Pb), which may cause harmful emissions and corrosion problems. Hightemperature corrosion occurs typically on furnace <b>waterwalls</b> and superheaters. The corrosion of the boiler tube materials limits the increase of thermal efficiency of steam boilers and leads to costly shutdowns and repairs. In recent years, some concerns have been raised about halogen (Cl, Br, and F) -related hightemperature corrosion in biomass- and waste-fired boilers. Chlorine-related high-temperature corrosion has been studied extensively. The presence of alkali chlorides in the deposits is believed {{to play a major role}} in the corrosion observed in biomass and waste fired boilers. However, there is much less information found in literature on the corrosion effect of bromine and fluorine. According to the literature, bromine is only assumed to play a role similar to chlorine; the role of fluorine is even less understood. In this work, a series of bubbling fluidized bed (BFB) bench-scale tests were carried out to characterize the formation and sulfation behaviors of KCl and KBr in BFB combustion conditions. Furthermore, a series of laboratory tests were carried out to investigate the hightemperature corrosion behaviors of three different superheater steels (10 CrMo 9 - 10, AISI 347 and Sanicro 28) exposed to potassium halides in ambient air and wet air (containing 30 % H 2 O). The influence of H 2 O and O 2 on the high-temperature corrosion of steels both with and without a salt (KCl) in three gas atmospheres (2 % H 2 O- 30 % O 2 -N 2, 2 % H 2 O- 2 % O 2 -N 2 and 30 % H 2 O- 2 % O 2 -N 2) was also studied. From the bench-scale BFB combustion tests, it was found that HBr has a clearly higher affinity for the available K forming KBr than HCl forming KCl. The tests also indicated that KCl has a higher tendency for sulfation than KBr. From the laboratory corrosion tests in ambient air (also called “dry air” in Paper III and Paper IV), it was found that at relatively low temperatures (≤ 550 °C) the corrosivity of KBr and KF are similar to KCl. At 600 °C, KF showed much stronger corrosivity than KBr and KCl, especially for 10 CrMo 9 - 10 and AISI 347. When exposed to KBr or KF, 10 CrMo 9 - 10 was durable at least up to 450 °C, while AISI 347 and Sanicro 28 were durable at least up to 550 °C. From the laboratory corrosion tests in wet air (30 % H 2 O), no obvious effect of water vapor was detected at 450 °C. At 550 °C, the influence of water vapor became significant in some cases, but the trend was not consistent. At 550 °C, after exposure with KBr, 10 CrMo 9 - 10 suffered from extreme corrosion; after exposure with KF and KCl, the corrosion was less severe, but still high. At 550 °C, local deep pitting corrosion occurred on AISI 347 and Sanicro 28 after exposure with KF. Some formation of K 2 CrO 4 was observed in the oxide layer. At 550 °C, AISI 347 and Sanicro 28 suffered from low corrosion (oxide layer thickness of < 10 μm) after exposure with KBr and KCl. No formation of K 2 CrO 4 was observed. Internal oxidation occurred in the cases of AISI 347 with KBr and KCl. From the laboratory corrosion tests in three different gas atmospheres (2 % H 2 O- 30 % O 2 -N 2, 2 % H 2 O- 2 % O 2 -N 2 and 30 % H 2 O- 2 % O 2 -N 2), it was found that in tests with no salt, no corrosion occurred on AISI 347 and Sanicro 28 up to 600 °C in both the “O 2 -rich” (2 % H 2 O- 30 % O 2 -N 2) and “H 2 O-rich” (30 % H 2 O- 2 % O 2 -N 2) gas atmospheres; only 10 CrMo 9 - 10 showed increased corrosion with increasing temperature. For 10 CrMo 9 - 10 in the “O 2 -rich” atmosphere, the presence of KCl significantly increased the corrosion compared to the “no salt” cases. For 10 CrMo 9 - 10 in the “H 2 O-rich” atmosphere, the presence or absence of KCl did not show any big influence on corrosion. The formation of K 2 CrO 4 was observed only in the case with the “O 2 -rich” atmosphere. Considering both the results from the BFB tests and the laboratory corrosion tests, if fuels containing Br were to be combusted, the corrosion damage of superheaters would be expected to be higher than if the fuels contain only Cl. Information generated from these studies can be used to help the boiler manufacturers in selecting materials for the most demanding combustion systems...|$|R
