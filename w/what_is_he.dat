500|$|In one {{sequence}} {{the character}} Martin Vanger plays the song [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] by Enya before beginning his torture of Mikael Blomkvist. David Fincher, the director, {{said that he}} believed that Martin [...] "doesn’t like to kill, he doesn’t like to hear the screams, without hearing his favorite music" [...] so therefore the character should play a song during the scene. Daniel Craig, the actor who played Blomkvist, selected [...] "Orinoco Flow" [...] on his iPod as a candidate song. Fincher said [...] "And we all almost pissed ourselves, we were laughing so hard. No, actually, it’s worse than that. He said, ‘Orinoco Flow!’ Everybody looked at each other, like, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> talking about?

500|$|Second-term U.S Representative Joe Sestak, {{a former}} U.S. Navy admiral, began privately {{discussing}} {{the possibility of}} seeking the Democratic nomination {{with his family in}} December 2008. Senator Bob Menendez, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, approached Sestak in April 2009 and asked him to run, but Sestak claimed he was not initially interested. Nevertheless, media speculation about Sestak's possible campaign began as early as mid-April 2009, and intensified the day [...] Specter changed political parties. While most Democrats embraced the long-time Senator, Sestak issued a statement criticizing Specter's decision, declaring it an opportunist move that should have been made in consultation with Pennsylvanians rather than the Senate Democratic leadership and the Washington political establishment. Menendez approached Sestak again, this time asking him not to run against Specter, but Sestak did not agree to back down. Later, when asked by Fox News, Sestak insisted he had not decided whether he would run for the office, but declined to immediately endorse Specter and said he had to [...] "wait and see". During a May 3 appearance on CNN's State of the Union with John King, Sestak questioned whether Specter was really a genuine Democrat, adding, [...] "I think Arlen has to tell us not that it was too hard to run against someone. ... What I need to know is, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> running for?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge" [...] {{was written}} by Dana Gould and {{directed}} by Pete Michels. It was first broadcast on the Fox network in the United States on May 22, 2002. The idea for the episode was also pitched by Gould, who had just moved to southern California with his wife. After moving in, the two decided to install an alarm system because, Gould quipped, [...] "the police aren't enough. Too many people wanna kill you." [...] When meeting the other writers, Gould pitched an episode in which Homer becomes {{the owner of a}} security company, which then became [...] "Poppa's Got a Brand New Badge." [...] Although current showrunner Al Jean found it [...] "very funny," [...] the episode's first draft was heavily altered after the first table-read, a process in which the script is read out loud to the other writers. During the blackout, Lenny and Carl accidentally crash their cars into a store, causing a riot to erupt. The sequence was conceived by Gould who, after the 1992 Los Angeles riots, was [...] "somewhat obsessed" [...] with civil unrest issues. In the DVD commentary for the episode, he said [...] "I love the idea of, 'All you need is for the power to go out and slowly the fabric of society unravels." [...] While trying to determine who stole Lisa's Malibu Stacy car, Homer holds Bart as his prime suspect. Unbeknownst to Bart, who is eating an apple, Homer tells Lisa [...] "Look at him over there, eating that apple. <b>What</b> <b>is</b> <b>he</b> planning?" [...] Originally, the scene would show Homer suspecting Lisa, but because it bothered the character's voice actor, Yeardley Smith, the scene was changed. American actor Joe Mantegna reprises his role as Fat Tony in the episode.|$|E
