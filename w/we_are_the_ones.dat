On September 26, 2013, We the Kings set up a crowd-funding campaign on the website IndieGoGo to record a new album with a target goal of $35,000. The band offered 12 perks to fans who could receive rewards for their contribution such as a [...] "Thank You" [...] in the album's credits section, or spending {{a day in the}} studio. While the campaign ran for 30 days, the goal was met within 24 hours. The group received $67,000 in a matter of two days and eventually received at total of $149,483 from 2,309 contributors. Initially, the group thought that this figure was an error. After being contacted, IndieGoGo confirmed the amount was correct. Clark commented that their fans [...] "can expect this to be the best album we've ever made, because there are no strings attached. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> deciding everything about this album and with your help we can truly make the best WTK album yet." ...|$|E
500|$|... "We Are the World" [...] is sung from a {{first person}} viewpoint, {{allowing}} {{the audience to}} [...] "internalize" [...] the message by singing the word we together. It {{has been described as}} [...] "an appeal to human compassion". The first lines in the song's repetitive chorus proclaim, [...] "We are the world, we are the children, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> who make a brighter day, so let's start giving". [...] "We Are the World" [...] opens with Lionel Richie, Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Kenny Rogers, James Ingram, Tina Turner and Billy Joel singing the first verse. Michael Jackson and Diana Ross follow, completing the first chorus together. Dionne Warwick, Willie Nelson and Al Jarreau sing the second verse, before Bruce Springsteen, Kenny Loggins, Steve Perry and Daryl Hall go through the second chorus. Co-writer Jackson, Huey Lewis, Cyndi Lauper and Kim Carnes follow with the song's bridge. This structuring of the song is said to [...] "create a sense of continuous surprise and emotional buildup". [...] "We Are the World" [...] concludes with Bob Dylan and Ray Charles singing a full chorus, Wonder and Springsteen duetting, and ad libs from Charles and Ingram.|$|E

2500|$|Rosenqvist was {{confused}} over his ten-second time penalty for his pit stop release which saw him narrowly avoid hitting his teammate Heidfeld, saying he realised his teammate was entering the pit lane and applied his brakes to enable his teammate to overtake him: [...] "I feel like I was always behind {{and it was}} not really my fault. That's why I'm a bit confused why I got the penalty." [...] Mahindra was also fined €1,500 for unsafely releasing Heidfeld from his garage and into the path of Piquet. Dilbagh Gill described Heidfeld's rise up the field to finish in tenth place as a [...] "master class in wheel-to-wheel racing" [...] and said his team would look forward to preparing for the season's remaining races. Heidfeld called the result [...] "bittersweet" [...] as he stated his strong form meant had his sensor problem emerged in qualifying he could have finished in a higher position. Rosenqvist said with his team's strong pace in the two Berlin races, he believed he could further increase his advantage over Prost in the Drivers' Championship: [...] "It was a very long and tough weekend!

In early March, Zendaya was cast in the film as Michelle, and Tomei was confirmed as May Parker. The following month, Feige confirmed that characters from previous MCU films would appear, and clarified that the deal formed with Sony does not specify which characters can and cannot crossover. He noted that the sharing between the studios was done with [...] "good faith" [...] in order [...] "to have more toys to play with as we put together a story", and that [...] "the agreement was {{that it is very}} much a Sony Pictures movie... we are the creative producers. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> hiring the actor, introducing him in , and then working right now on the script and soon to be shooting". Sony Pictures chairman Thomas Rothman further added that Sony has final greenlight authority, but were deferring creatively to Marvel.

Tony Revolori and Laura Harrier joined the cast as classmates of Parker's, and Downey Jr. was revealed to be in the film as Stark.
