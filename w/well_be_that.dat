5|$|Eowa {{was killed}} at Maserfield along with Oswald, {{although}} on which side he fought is unknown. It may <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> he fought as a dependent ally of Oswald against Penda. If Eowa {{was in fact}} dominant among the Mercians during the period {{leading up to the}} battle, then his death could have marked what the author of the Historia Brittonum regarded as the beginning of Penda's ten-year reign. Thus it may be that Penda prevailed not only over the Northumbrians but also over his rivals among the Mercians.|$|E
5|$|Kentish {{manufacture}} before 600 included glass beakers and jewelry. Kentish jewellers {{were highly}} skilled, {{and before the}} end of the sixth century they gained access to gold. Goods from Kent are found in cemeteries across the channel and as far away as at the mouth of the Loire. It is not known what Kent traded for all of this wealth, although it seems likely that there was a flourishing slave trade. It may <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> this wealth was the foundation of Æthelberht's strength, although his overlordship and the associated right to demand tribute would have brought wealth in its turn.|$|E
5|$|Warelwast {{served the}} king as an envoy to Pope Urban II in 1095, when {{the king was}} seeking to have the newly {{appointed}} Archbishop of Canterbury, Anselm of Canterbury, removed from office. He visited the pope with another royal clerk, Gerard, with orders to recognize Urban as pope in return for Anselm's deposition, {{at least according to}} Eadmer, an Anselm partisan. The two clerks travelled very quickly, as they did not leave before 28February 1095 and were back in England by 13May 1095. Eadmer claimed that the ambassadors were supposed to acquire a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, for the king to give to his new choice as archbishop. But although the king may have instructed his envoys to attempt to secure these objects, he was probably willing to negotiate and to settle for less. The two clerks returned with a papal legate, Walter of Albano, who accepted the king's recognition of Urban but refused to allow Anselm's deposition. The king did nevertheless manage to secure recognition of his royal rights in the church, and a concession that no papal legates or communications would be sent without his approval. It may <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the king always regarded Anselm's deposition as unlikely.|$|E

5|$|To sustain this {{military}} machine and meet other state expenses, {{large amounts of}} revenue were necessary. Greater Poland had some natural resources used for trade, such as fur, hide, honey and wax, but those surely did not provide enough income. According to Ibrahim ibn Yaqub, Prague in Bohemia, a city built of stone, was the main center for the exchange of trading commodities {{in this part of}} Europe. From Kraków, the Slavic traders brought tin, salt, amber and whatever other products they had, most importantly slaves; Muslim, Jewish, Hungarian and other traders were the buyers. The Life of St. Adalbert, written {{at the end of the}} 10th century by John Canaparius, records the fate of many Christian slaves sold in Prague as the main curse of the time. Dragging of shackled slaves is shown as a scene in the bronze 12th-century Gniezno Doors. It may <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the territorial expansion financed itself by being the source of loot, of which the captured local people were the most valuable part. The scale of the human trade practice is arguable, however, because much of the population from the defeated tribes was resettled for agricultural work or in the near-gord settlements, where they could serve the victors in various capacities and thus contribute to the economic and demographic potential of the state. Considerable increase of population density was characteristic of the newly established states in eastern and central Europe. The slave trade not insufficient to meet all revenue needs, the Piast state had to look for other options.|$|E
25|$|Common cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) {{have been}} noted as regular brood parasites of L. e. excubitor in the past; for reasons unknown this has ceased since the late 1970s or so.

Among predators of eggs and nestlings, corvids (Corvidae) – {{extremely}} close relatives of the shrikes (Laniidae) as it happens – are most significant.|$|E

It was noted that {{in other parts of}} the world, chickens were more susceptible to such infections than in the study area, but it may <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> Muscovy ducks are generally more often infected with such parasites (which might not cause pronounced disease though, and are harmless to humans).|$|E

25|$|One {{explanation}} for Venus's lack of plate tectonics {{is that on}} Venus temperatures are too high for significant water to be present. The Earth's crust is soaked with water, and water {{plays an important role}} in the development of shear zones. Plate tectonics requires weak surfaces in the crust along which crustal slices can move, and it may <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> such weakening never took place on Venus because of the absence of water. However, some researchers remain convinced that plate tectonics is or was once active on this planet.|$|E
25|$|According to Atimal and Ellenblum the Islamization of Palestine had its {{beginnings}} {{in the early}} Islamic period (ca. 640–1099 C.E.), but had halted and apparently even been reversed {{during the time of}} Frankish rule (Kingdom of Jerusalem). In the aftermath of the Muslim reconquest, which began in 1187, and the advent of Ayyubid rule (1187–1260) in parts of Palestine and then the Mamluk rule, it appears that the process of religious conversion was accelerated. With the beginning of the Ottoman period in 1516, it is commonly assumed, and may <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the Muslim majority in the country was more-or-less like that of the mid-19th century.|$|E
25|$|The date of {{construction}} for the stone bridge can be accurately determined from contemporary sources: two laudatory poems of Paul the Silentiary and Agathias, dating to the year 562, celebrate its completion, and the chronicler Theophanes records that the work began in Anno Mundi 6052, which corresponds to 559–560. Conversely, since Procopius states that the bridge was still under construction when he wrote his work on Justinian's building projects (De Aedificiis), this would mean that {{it was written in}} the years 560–561, five to six years later than earlier presumed. However, given that Theophanes' dating is somewhat inaccurate, it may <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the bridge's construction had originally started in ca. 554.|$|E

25|$|Julia Robinson and Yuri Matiyasevich {{showed that}} every Diophantine set has {{dimension}} no greater than 13. Later, Matiyasevich sharpened their methods {{to show that}} 9 unknowns suffice. Although it may <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> this result {{is not the best}} possible, there has been no further progress. So, in particular, there is no algorithm for testing Diophantine equations with 9 or fewer unknowns for solvability in natural numbers. For the case of rational integer solutions (as Hilbert had originally posed it), the 4 squares trick shows that there is no algorithm for equations with no more than 36 unknowns. But Zhi Wei Sun showed that the problem for integers is unsolvable even for equations with no more than 11 unknowns.|$|E
25|$|While for {{bodies in}} their own {{thermodynamic}} equilibrium states, the notion of temperature requires that all empirical thermometers must agree as to which of two bodies is the hotter or that {{they are at the}} same temperature, this requirement is not safe for bodies that are in steady states though not in thermodynamic equilibrium. It can then <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> different empirical thermometers disagree about which is the hotter, and if this is so, then {{at least one of the}} bodies does not have a well defined absolute thermodynamic temperature. Nevertheless, any one given body and any one suitable empirical thermometer can still support notions of empirical, non-absolute, hotness and temperature, for a suitable range of processes. This is a matter for study in non-equilibrium thermodynamics.|$|E

500|$|Another {{point of}} {{contention}} concerns precisely how, and by what means, the individual was beaten.

500|$|Kaplony has {{proposed}} that Shepseskare started {{to build a}} sun temple named Ḥtp-jb-Rˁ, reading [...] "Hotepibre" [...] and meaning [...] "Satisfied {{is the heart of}} Ra". Although all the kings of the early to mid-Fifth Dynasty, from Userkaf to Menkauhor Kaiu, did build sun temples, Verner regards Kaplony's hypothesis as [...] "sheer speculation" [...] since {{it is based on the}} tentative reconstruction of a single clay seal. Verner first argues that this seal is not inscribed with Shepseskare's name but rather bears traces of a Horus name which could equally <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> of Djedkare Isesi. Second, Verner notes that the name of a sun temple is rarely found with that of the king who built it: more often it is found with the name of another king during whose reign the seal was made. Finally, he doubts that the sign reading Ḥtp, [...] "Hotep", is really part of the name of a sun temple. Instead, he believes it is more probable that the seal either refers to the sun temple of Neferirkare, named St-jb-Rˁ.w, that is [...] "Setibraw"; or to that of Nyuserre, which was called Šsp-jb-Rˁ, [...] "Shesepibraw".|$|E
500|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding Manhunt reached a peak on July 28, 2004, {{when the game}} {{was linked to the}} murder of 14-year-old Stefan Pakeerah by his 17-year-old friend Warren Leblanc in Leicestershire, England. Initial media reports claimed that police had found a copy of the game in Leblanc's bedroom, which police had seized as evidence, and Giselle Pakeerah, the victim's mother, stated [...] "I think that I heard some of Warren's friends say that he was obsessed by this game. To quote from the website that promotes it, it calls it a psychological experience, not a game, and it encourages brutal killing. If he was obsessed by it, it could <b>well</b> <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the boundaries for him became quite hazy." [...] Stefan's father, Patrick, added [...] "they were playing a game called Manhunt. The way Warren committed the murder this is how the game is set out, killing people using weapons like hammers and knives. There is some connection between the game and what he has done." [...] Patrick continued [...] "The object of Manhunt is not just to go out and kill people. It's a point-scoring game where you increase your score depending on how violent the killing is. That explains why Stefan's murder was as horrific as it was. If these games influence kids to go out and kill, then we do not want them in the shops." [...] A spokesman for the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers' Association (ELSPA) responded to the accusations by stating [...] "We sympathize enormously with the family and parents of Stefan Pakeerah. However, we reject any suggestion or association between the tragic events and the sale of the video game Manhunt. The game in question is classified 18 by the British Board of Film Classification and therefore its copies should not be in the possession of a minor. Simply being in someone's possession does not and should not lead to the conclusion that a game is responsible for these tragic events." ...|$|E
