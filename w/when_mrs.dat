5|$|Smythe {{first became}} {{interested}} in horse racing as a boy, when he would take stories his father wrote at the track to the newspaper office downtown. Smythe started owning horses in the late 1920s, but he rarely had any success. One early purchase {{turned out to be}} one of his most famous. <b>When</b> <b>Mrs.</b> L. A. Livingston sold off her stable, he bought Rare Jewel, a filly, for $250. The filly regularly ran last. The horse was eligible for the Coronation Futurity Stakes, one of the best two-year-old races. Smythe was full of blind hope, and on the trainer's advice, entered her in the race. The day of the race, both the trainer and his partner gave the horse some brandy, unknown to Smythe, who bet over $100 on Rare Jewel. She won the race, a 100–1 longshot paying $214.40 on a $2 bet, besting future Queen's Plate winner Froth Blower. Between the winnings from his bets and his portion of the winner's purse as horse owner, Smythe won more than $10,000 on that one race. Three weeks later, he put his windfall to work for the Maple Leafs by purchasing star defenceman King Clancy from the depression-strapped Ottawa Senators for $35,000. The purchase was only possible because of his gambling winnings, as the other Maple Leafs owners refused to pay the Senators' then-high price, and only agreed when Smythe volunteered to use his own money.|$|E

40|$|This paper assesses whether {{labor market}} frictions, {{in the form}} of searching and matching, can help explain {{movements}} in the labor wedge - the gap between the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) and the marginal productivity of labor in a perfectly competitive business cycle model. Results suggest that those frictions are not able to explain fluctuations in the labor wedge, per se. However, the introduction of extensive and intensive margin shows that measuring the MRS in terms of total hours artificially introduces procyclicality in the <b>MRS.</b> <b>When</b> the <b>MRS</b> is correctly measured in terms of hours per worker, the labor wedge obtained is less variable than the one of the perfectly competitive model. A Frisch elasticity of 2. 8, as in most macro models, implies a 20 percent decline in the variability of the labor wedge. A Frisch elasticity closer to micro estimates implies an even higher reduction. Finally, we show {{that it is possible to}} measure a strongly procyclical labor wedge as in CKM (2007) even if the actual data generating process does not have any labor wedge but has search frictions that allow for movements in both labor margins...|$|R

40|$|Phosphorus {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to study muscle phosphates metabolism in several brain disorders. Those with primary mitochondrial encephalomyopathies showed the typical pattern of impaired oxidative metabolism at rest and during recovery after exercise. In migraine, Parkinson's disease and alternating hemiplegia muscle MRS observations lend support to a possible mitochondrial dysfunction. Similar observations in multiple sclerosis {{are probably the result}} of secondary deconditioning. In post polio syndrome and in some of the hereditary ataxias, elevated intracellular inorganic phosphates {{may be the result of}} another, yet unknown, metabolic impairment. Thus, muscle phosphate metabolism may be altered in various central nervous system (CNS) disorders by different metabolic impairments.

Autoaggregating (AA) L. crispatus strains showed 50 % more CRB than the reference strain, the curli-producing E. coli MC 4100. CRB of L. crispatus 12005, L. paracasei F 8, L. plantarum F 44 and L. paracasei F 19 was enhanced <b>when</b> grown in <b>MRS</b> broth with 0. 5 % taurocholic acid (TA) or 5 % porcine bile (PB) (P< 0. 05). CSH was also enhanced for the non-AA strains, L. plantarum F 44, L. paracasei F 19 and L. rhamnosus GG <b>when</b> grown in <b>MRS</b> broth with 0. 5 % TA, 5 % PB or 0. 25 % mucin with enhanced biofilm formation in MRS broth with bile (P< 0. 05). Two AA strains, L. crispatus 12005 and L. paracasei F 8, developed biofilm independent of bile or mucin. In summary, under bile stressed growth conditions, early (24 h cultures) biofilm formation is associated with an increase in hydrophobic cell surface proteins and high CRB.

40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{techniques for}} comparing {{the ability of}} Markov regime switching (MRS) models to fit underlying regimes {{of a series of}} interest. This is particularly important in the business cycle literature where one may be interested in determining whether using leading indicators to allow transition probabilities to vary improves the ability of MRS models to fit the NBER business cycle chronology. This is typically done using the quadratic probability score, or QPS (Diebold and Rudebusch (1989)). Although it is possible to statistically compare the QPS statistics for two MRS models using the Diebold and Mariano (1995) (DM) test statistic for comparing forecasts, we find using a Monte Carlo experiment that the DM statistic tends to under-reject (the null of “no difference in forecast accuracy”) <b>when</b> comparing <b>MRS</b> models. This we believe is because of the strong non-normality of the forecast errors of such models.

40|$|Most Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) {{localization}} {{methods can}} generate gradient vibrations at acoustic frequencies and/or magnetic field oscillation, {{which can cause}} a time-varying magnetic field superimposed onto the static one. This effect can produce frequency modulations of the spectral resonances. <b>When</b> localized <b>MRS</b> data are acquired without water suppression, the associated frequency modulations are manifested as a manifold of spurious peaks, called sidebands, which occur symmetrically around the water resonance. These sidebands can be larger than the small metabolite resonances and can present {{a problem for the}} quantitation of the spectra, especially at short echo times. Furthermore, the resonance lineshapes may be distorted if any low frequency modulations are present. A simple solution is presented which consists of selecting the modulus of the acquired Free Induction Decay (FID) signal. Since the frequency modulations affect only the phase of the FID signal, the obtained real spectrum of the modulus is free from the spurious peaks where quantitative results may be directly obtained. Using this method, the distortions caused by the sidebands are removed. This is demonstrated by processing proton MRS spectra acquired without water suppression collected from a phantom containing metabolites at concentrations comparable t...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIt has {{previously}} been reported that the heterogeneity of the geomagnetic field disturbs the currently- measured free induction decay signal of magnetic resonance sounding (MRS). To overcome the limitation of MRS in a non-homogeneous geomagnetic field, we adapted the spin-echo methodology usually used at the laboratory scale and in boreholes. We present examples of measurements carried out in a sandy aquifer in southern India. The 15 - 25 m thick sand deposit overlays a gneissic basement. Two sources of geomagnetic field heterogeneity have been identified at this site, both affecting the geomagnetic field within the sandy aquifer: the gneissic bedrock and an intruded dyke into the bedrock. Spin-echo and free induction decay signals have been recorded at six locations. We found that the groundwater content, {{the thickness of the}} saturated aquifer and its transmissivity calculated with free induction decay measurements are underestimated compared to those derived from spin-echo measurements. The closer to the dyke the higher the underestimation. Time-domain electromagnetic measurements indicate that the aquifer is rather homogeneous at the site scale, as suggested by spin-echo results. We also found that a small heterogeneity of the geomagnetic field can go unnoticed, thus leading to an unknown mis-estimate of aquifer properties when using free induction decay measurements. Thus spin-echo measurements can be used to improve the accuracy of aquifer characterization <b>when</b> using <b>MRS</b> in geological contexts where geomagnetic field heterogeneity exists...|$|R
40|$|Lactobacilli {{belong to}} the group of lactic acid {{bacteria}} (LAB), that have several distinguished abilities such as production of lactic acid, enzymes such as β -Galactosidase and natural antimicrobial substances called bacteriocins. Bacteriocin is a biopreservative agent potential of suppressing growth of some contaminant bacteria in food industry but its commercial availability is limited and costly. The study aimed to select isolates of Lactobacillus spp. potential for producing bacteriocins to suppress the growth of Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 and Bacillus subtilis NCIB 3610, and to optimize the process of bacteriocin production. Results obtained in this study showed that L. acidophilus isolate CH 1 was selected as the best candidate for bacteriocin among the four isolates that tested.

40|$|Objective Reliable {{biomarkers}} for {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS) are needed, {{given the}} clinical heterogeneity of the disease. Here, we provide proof‐of‐concept for using multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a diagnostic biomarker for ALS. Specifically, we evaluated the added diagnostic utility of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Methods Twenty‐nine patients with ALS and 30 age‐ and gender‐matched healthy controls underwent brain MRI which used proton MRS including spectral editing techniques to measure γ‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) and DTI to measure fractional anisotropy of the corticospinal tract. Data were analyzed using logistic regression, t ‐tests, and generalized linear models with leave‐one‐out analysis to generate and compare the resulting receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results The diagnostic accuracy is significantly improved <b>when</b> the <b>MRS</b> data were combined with the DTI data {{as compared to the}} DTI data only (area under the ROC curves (AUC)  =  0. 93 vs. AUC  =  0. 81; P  =  0. 05). The combined MRS and DTI data resulted in sensitivity of 0. 93, specificity of 0. 85, positive likelihood ratio of 6. 20, and negative likelihood ratio of 0. 08 whereas the DTI data only resulted in sensitivity of 0. 86, specificity of 0. 70, positive likelihood ratio of 2. 87, and negative likelihood ratio of 0. 20.

40|$|Background: Multiple rapid {{swallows}} (MRS) is {{a provocative}} test for assessment of contraction reserve, however reproducibility on repetitive MRS is incompletely understood. Our {{aim was to}} determine the optimal number of MRS sequences for consistent assessment of contraction reserve. Methods: One hundred and fifty-nine consecutive patients (79 IEM and 80 normal motility) who underwent high-resolution manometers were enrolled. Ten single swallows (SS) and 10 MRS were performed. Gold standard for evaluation of the contraction reserve was the ratio between the mean DCI of 10 MRS and the mean DCI of 10 SS (MRS/SS DCI ratio). Rates of false negatives and false positives were calculated for increasing numbers of MRS sequences, using either mean DCI or the MRS with the highest DCI. Key Results: According to the gold standard, 50 IEM and 50 normal motility patients had contraction reserve. With progressively increasing numbers of MRS sequences, contraction reserve was detected using mean MRS DCI within three and four MRS sequences in IEM and normal motility respectively, whereas two and three MRS sequences were needed using the MRS sequence with the highest DCI. False positives were much higher with highest DCI method compared with mean DCI, (22 % vs 9 % respectively in IEM; 24 % vs 9 % in normal motility) <b>when</b> three <b>MRS</b> sequences were considered. Conclusions & Inferences: At least three MRS are needed to reliably assess contraction reserve.
