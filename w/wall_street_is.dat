500|$|<b>Wall</b> <b>Street</b> <b>is</b> not a {{wholesale}} criticism of capitalism, {{but of the}} cynical, quick-buck culture of the 1980s. The [...] "good" [...] characters in the film are themselves capitalists, but in a more steady, hardworking sense. In one scene, Gekko scoffs at Bud Fox's question as to the moral value of hard work, quoting the example of his (Gekko's) father, who worked hard his entire life only to die in debt. Lou Mannheim, the film's archetypal mentor, says early in the film, that [...] "good things sometimes take time", referring to IBM and Hilton—in contrast, Gekko's [...] "Greed is Good" [...] credo typifies the short-term view prevalent in the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|Jeffrey [...] "Mad Dog" [...] Beck, a star {{investment}} banker {{at the time}} with Drexel Burnham Lambert, {{was one of the}} film's technical advisers and has a cameo appearance in the film as the man speaking at the meeting discussing the breakup of Bluestar. Kenneth Lipper, {{investment banker}} and former deputy mayor of New York for Finance and Economic Development, was also hired as chief technical adviser. At first, he turned Stone down because he felt that the film would be a one-sided attack. Stone asked him to reconsider and Lipper read the script responding with a 13-page critique. For example, he argued that it was unrealistic to have all the characters be [...] "morally bankrupt". Lipper advised Stone on the kind of computers used on the trading floor, the accurate proportion of women at a business meeting, and the kinds of extras that should be seated at the annual shareholders meeting where Gekko delivers his [...] "Greed is good" [...] speech. Stone agreed with Lipper's criticism and asked him to rewrite the script. Lipper brought a balance to the film and this helped Stone get permission to shoot {{on the floor of the}} New York Stock Exchange during trading hours. Lipper and Stone disagreed over the character of Lou Mannheim. Stone shot a scene showing the honest Mannheim giving in to insider trading, but Lipper argued that audiences might conclude that everyone on <b>Wall</b> <b>Street</b> <b>is</b> corrupt and insisted that the film needed an unimpeachable character. Stone cut the scene.|$|E

2500|$|Several {{environmentalist}} leaders supported Occupy Wall Street. In 2011, Greenpeace Executive Director Phil Radford expressed Occupy Wall Street, stating:: [...] "We stand – {{as individuals}} and an organization – with Occupiers of {{all walks of life}} who peacefully stand up for a just, democratic, green and peaceful future." [...] Bill McKibben [...] of 350.org stated: [...] "The reason that it’s so great that we’re occupying <b>Wall</b> <b>Street</b> <b>is</b> because Wall Street has been occupying the atmosphere." [...] Sarah Hodgdon of the Sierra Club stated: [...] "Many Sierra Club staff and volunteer leaders have participated in and/or lent support to these demonstrations standing up for the end to corporate greed. The demands and values of the protesters are very much in line with Sierra Club’s strategic priority of confronting the power of the coal and oil industries." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Wall</b> <b>Street</b> <b>is</b> a major {{location}} of tourism in New York City. One report described lower Manhattan as [...] "swarming with camera-carrying tourists". Tour guides highlight {{places such as}} Trinity Church, the Federal Reserve gold vaults 80 feet below street level (worth $100 billion), and the NYSE. A Scoundrels of Wall Street Tour is a walking historical tour which includes a museum visit and discussion of various financiers [...] "who were adept at finding ways around finance laws or loopholes through them". Occasionally artists make impromptu performances; for example, in 2010, a troupe of 22 dancers [...] "contort their bodies and cram themselves into the nooks and crannies of the Financial District in Bodies in Urban Spaces" [...] choreographed by Willi Donner. One chief attraction, the Federal Reserve Building in lower Manhattan, paid $750,000 to open a visitors' gallery in 1997. The New York Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange also spent money in the late 1990s to upgrade facilities for visitors. Attractions include the gold vault beneath the Federal Reserve and that [...] "staring down at the trading floor was as exciting as going to the Statue of Liberty".|$|E
2500|$|Noting {{the growing}} union support, {{an article in}} the progressive-leaning Mother Jones {{magazine}} said that union support could splinter and derail the protests rather than sustain them because while unions are tightly organized, hierarchical, and run with a clear chain of command, Occupy <b>Wall</b> <b>Street</b> <b>is</b> the opposite in that they are [...] "a horizontal, autonomous, leaderless, modified-consensus-based system with roots in anarchist thought." [...] However, the article went on to suggest that if the unions and OWS joined together they could work to create a progressive movement that [...] "effectively taps into the rising feeling among many Americans that economic opportunity has been squashed by corporate greed and the influence of the very rich in politics." [...] As the success of the movement has become apparent, union organizers have begun to embrace some of their social media skills, bold tactics, and the simplicity of the 99% slogan. Damon Silvers, the AFL–CIO's policy director, said, “We think the Occupy movement has given voice to something very basic about what’s going on in our country right now. The fact that they’ve figured out certain concepts and language for doing that, we think is really important and positive.” The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) has endorsed the movement saying, [...] "We recognize the need to work together and learn from each other. The vitality, energy and dialogue growing from the Occupy Wall Street movement show the potential to organize, build power and win justice for the middle class.” ...|$|E
