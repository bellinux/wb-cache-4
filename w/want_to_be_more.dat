The lamb, looking very silly and self-conscious, was holding up a forepaw, in the cleft of which was dangerously perched a little flag with a red cross. Very pale yellow, the lamb, with greenish shadows. Since {{she was a child}} she had liked this creature, with the same feeling she felt for the little woolly lambs on green legs that {{children}} carried home from the fair every year. She had always liked these toys, and she had the same amused, childish liking for this church lamb. Yet she had always been uneasy about it. She was never sure that this lamb with a flag did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> than it appeared. So she half mistrusted it, there was a mixture of dislike in her attitude to it.|$|E
60|$|It {{is proper}} {{to put this}} philosophic matter first, before the æsthetic {{appreciation}} of Meredith, because with Meredith a sort of passing bell has rung and the Victorian orthodoxy is certainly no longer safe. Dickens and Carlyle, as we have said, rebelled against the orthodox compromise: but Meredith has escaped from it. Cosmopolitanism, Socialism, Feminism {{are already in the}} air; and Queen Victoria has begun to look like Mrs. Grundy. But to escape from a city is one thing: to choose a road is another. The free-thinker who found himself outside the Victorian city, found himself also in the fork of two very different naturalistic paths. One of them went upwards through a tangled but living forest to lonely but healthy hills: the other went down to a swamp. Hardy went down to botanise in the swamp, while Meredith climbed towards the sun. Meredith became, at his best, a sort of daintily dressed Walt Whitman: Hardy became a sort of village atheist brooding and blaspheming over the village idiot. It is largely because the free-thinkers, as a school, have hardly made up their minds whether they <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> optimist or more pessimist than Christianity that their small but sincere movement has failed.|$|E
6000|$|My Dear Friend,--By this morning's post I {{have your}} list, and, in general, I highly approve of it. I shall, at more leisure, {{give you a}} {{critique}} on the whole. Clarke goes to your town by to-day's fly, and I wish you would call on him and take his opinion in general; you know his taste is a standard. He will return here again {{in a week or}} two, so please do not miss asking for him. One thing I hope he will do--persuade you to adopt my favourite, [...] "Craigie-burn wood", in your selection; it is as great a favourite of his as of mine. The lady on whom it was made is one of the finest women in Scotland; and, in fact (entre nous), is in a manner to me what Sterne's Eliza was to him--a mistress, a friend, or what you will, in the guileless simplicity of Platonic love. (Now, don't put any of your squinting constructions on this, or have any clishmaclaiver about it among our acquaintances.) I assure you that to my lovely friend you are indebted for many of your best songs of mine. Do you think that the sober gin-horse routine of existence could inspire a man with life, and love, and joy--could fire him with enthusiasm, or melt him with pathos, equal to the genius of your book? No! no! Whenever I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> than ordinary in song--to be in some degree equal to your diviner airs--do you imagine I fast and pray for the divine emanation? Tout au contraire! I have a glorious recipe--the very one that for his own use was invented by the divinity of healing and poetry, when erst he piped to the flocks of Admetus. I put myself on a regimen of admiring a fine woman; and in proportion to the adorability of her charms, in proportion you are delighted with my verses. The lightning of her eye is the godhead of Parnassus, and the witchery of her smile the divinity of Helicon! ...|$|E
