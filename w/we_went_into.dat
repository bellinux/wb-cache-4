But I asked her to sing it all, and she just made up the whole melody on the spot, and sang this amazing solo. At that moment I realised that this girl has a really special gift.|$|E
5|$|Anyone who {{has ever}} studied the history of American diplomacy, {{especially}} military diplomacy, knows that you might start in a war with certain things on your mind as a purpose {{of what you are}} doing, but in the end, you found yourself fighting for entirely different things that you had never thought of before... In other words, war has a momentum of its own and it carries you away from all thoughtful intentions when you get into it. Today, if <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> Iraq, like the president would like us to do, you know where you begin. You never know where you are going to end.|$|E
5|$|I went to New York {{and we were}} in {{the studio}} and came to a break. I was sitting at the piano and told Mariah about this movie. Within two hours, we had this {{incredible}} seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to sing. In her mind, we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, {{it was a little bit}} too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E

[...] Had it been usual, the freedom of Cleveland would have been conferred upon him." [...] According to John Hay, who would later become Secretary of State under McKinley, [...] "What a glorious record Mark Hanna has made this year!

500|$|Their {{politics}} were made explicit in {{the lyrics of}} such early recordings as [...] "White Riot", which encouraged disaffected white youths to riot like their black counterparts; [...] "Career Opportunities", which addressed the alienation of low-paid, routinised jobs and discontent over the lack of alternatives; and [...] "London's Burning", about the bleakness and boredom {{of life in the}} inner city. Artist Caroline Coon, who was associated with the punk scene, argued that [...] "hose tough, militaristic songs were what we needed as <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> Thatcherism". The scope of the band's political interests widened on later recordings.|$|E

500|$|Several former {{intelligence}} officials described the attack as emotionally distressing for the spy agency. Former CIA deputy director John E. McLaughlin said: [...] "It is the nightmare we've been anticipating since <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> Afghanistan and Iraq." [...] Bruce Hoffman, {{a professor at}} Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, characterized the assault as a serious reversal in NATO's war efforts. Former CIA Counterterrorism Chief Robert Grenier described the attack as the Taliban equivalent of a precision guided weapon. [...] "This attack is something {{that will never be}} forgotten in Langley, Virginia," [...] said Jack Rice, who formerly worked as a CIA officer in Afghanistan.|$|E

[...] "He was like, hey, I'll front you the money, and we'll split the profits until you pay me back," [...] {{recalled}} Hoppus in 2001. The two had met when Secor transferred from a north San Diego location. The two became friends quickly, despite Secor's seniority of post. [...] "At that point they'd played around enough to get their chops up so I took all the money I had in savings and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> the studio for two days," [...] said Secor.|$|E

Eight years ago <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> Afghanistan to eliminate al-Qaeda and the “safe haven” that Afghanistan’s Taliban were providing the terrorist group responsible for the 9/11 attacks. Al-Qaeda has no significant presence today in all of Afghanistan.... Instead of increasing our troop presence, the U.S. should limit its mission in Afghanistan to securing strategic Afghan population centers with the troops currently on the ground." ...|$|E

500|$|Filming {{of the two}} episodes {{occurred}} from September 25, 2015, until October 15, 2015. The Flashs {{episode was}} directed by Ralph Hemecker, and Arrows by Thor Freudenthal. Berlanti discussed the logistic nightmare of bringing the three series together since {{the first couple of}} episodes of Legends of Tomorrow had already been shot before the filming of the crossover episodes. In addition, there were characters from The Flash and Arrow [...] "that we were also shooting out of those respective shows before <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> shooting Legends to then have to come back and do the introduction of some of the characters here." [...] Falk Hentschel described the filming as [...] "an acting marathon" [...] constantly moving from one set to another during the day, but had a blast.|$|E
500|$|Three {{weeks after}} Marky joined the band, the Ramones began {{recording}} Road to Ruin in Midtown Manhattan at Media Sound Studios, {{the premises of}} a former Episcopalian Church. [...] Album engineer Ed Stasium explained the recording process: [...] "After Tommy left the band, we went straight into working on the Road to Ruin album with Marky. We rehearsed a long time with Marky, just getting it down. Then <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> the studio, recorded, and mixed the record at Media Sound. We {{spent a lot of}} money, and the entire summer, on Road to Ruin." [...] Music critic John Young of Rolling Stone called the album's production [...] "clean and simple", but pointed out that the track [...] "Bad Brain" [...] contained [...] "funny noises" [...] in between drum beats, which prevents the song from having the humorous asperity that was intended.|$|E
500|$|What {{is certain}} is that the breed took its name from Clumber Park and that the Duke of Newcastle's gamekeeper, William Mansell, is {{credited}} with their development and improvement. Prince Albert, the Prince consort of Queen Victoria, was a fancier and promoter of the breed, as was his son King Edward VII, who bred them at the Sandringham estate in Norfolk. The breed was shown in England from 1859 onward. They are referred to in Queen Victoria's diary: on October 16, 1840, she wrote, [...] "Walked out directly after breakfast before Albert went to shoot. He had his 7 fine Clumber Spaniels with us and <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> the Slopes, with such a funny old Gamekeeper, Walters, in order that I should see how the dogs found out their game. They are such dear, nice dogs." ...|$|E

500|$|Osbourne {{initially}} {{set out to}} form a solo project featuring former Dirty Tricks members John Frazer-Binnie, Terry Horbury, and Andy Bierne. As the new band were in rehearsals in January 1978, Osbourne had {{a change}} of heart and rejoined Black Sabbath. [...] "Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band", Iommi explained. [...] "He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the other guy (Walker), so it made it very difficult. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> the studio with basically no songs. We'd write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn't get time to reflect on stuff. 'Is this right? Is this working properly?' It was very difficult for me to come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick." ...|$|E
500|$|Faye Marsay, who {{portrayed the}} Waif, spoke about her scenes and filming with Williams, saying, [...] " [...] I {{think we did}} a month in Belfast before we started shooting. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> the stunt tent and lived there. It was choreographed like a dance. Maisie is so well coordinated and good at what she does. I'm {{a little bit less}} coordinated and easily pissed off. I would drop the stick down and go, [...] "I can't do it!" [...] And she would {{encourage}} me. She's so supportive. We did a month, and then the day before the cameras turned on, we would go through the moves a couple of times so we wouldn't hurt each other. There were a few times we clipped each other. I remember getting her in the stomach really bad one time, and she nearly cut my ear off at one point. It was fun. It was a lot of fun, but we were exhausted as well." ...|$|E
500|$|Furst {{and the art}} {{department}} deliberately mixed clashing architectural {{styles to}} [...] "make Gotham City the ugliest and bleakest metropolis imaginable". Furst continued, [...] "e imagined what New York City might have become without a planning commission. A city run by crime, with a riot of architectural styles. An essay in ugliness. As if hell erupted through the pavement and kept on going". The 1985 film Brazil by Terry Gilliam was also a notable influence upon the film's production design, as both Burton and Furst studied it as a reference. Derek Meddings served as the visual effects supervisor, while Keith Short helped construct the newly created 1989 Batmobile, adding two Browning machine guns. On designing the Batmobile, Furst explained, [...] "We looked at jet aircraft components, we looked at war machines, we looked at all sorts of things. In the end, <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> pure expressionism, taking the Salt Flat Racers of the 30s and the Sting Ray macho machines of the 50s". The car was built upon a Chevrolet Impala when previous development with a Jaguar and Ford Mustang failed.|$|E

500|$|At dawn, Ya'iri {{requested}} {{approval from}} Adan to withdraw his brigade, the paratroopers having thus far been unsuccessful in reaching Egyptian lines. Gonen denied the request, approving only medevac for the wounded. This was countermanded after Bar-Lev visited Adan at his command post and realized {{the gravity of}} the paratroopers' situation. An armored battalion was tasked with covering the paratroopers, but was unable to locate them. The paratroopers released red smoke to pinpoint their position, but this backfired as the Egyptians also spotted the smoke, directing accurate artillery fire against them and inflicting further casualties. The tanks assaulted the defenses, but suffered losses and fell back. It became evident that withdrawal could not be accomplished in the open; APCs and half-tracks were brought up to extract the paratroopers and the wounded—all the while under fire. The Israelis finally withdrew under cover of friendly tanks. In 14 hours of almost uninterrupted combat, the paratroopers suffered heavy casualties, with some 40–70 killed and 100 wounded. Ya'iri would state that [...] "We had suffered seventy casualties because <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> action too hastily, without proper intelligence on the enemy's defenses." [...] Armored losses sustained during the withdrawal were also heavy.|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Davis said {{regarding}} {{the writing of}} the album [...] "Right after we got done touring with Ozzy Osbourne, Ross [...] hooked up with us. <b>We</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> a rehearsal studio and started writing. It was faster and thrashier. It was us reacting the vibe that we had to hurry up and get this done. We thought, [...] "Let's do something great, but let's not take a year on it." [...] James [...] "Munky" [...] Shaffer collaborated [...] "Some of the songs and riffs from the first record had been lingering around for years. When it was time to write Life Is Peachy, we went back into the rehearsal studio and we wanted to take the elements that the fans liked and we liked about Korn and elaborate on some of those like Jonathan freaking out. [...] "Twist" [...] came to life. There was that dissonant guitar playing. There was more of a punk rock feel and attitude that the band had. I think a lot of that came from touring so much and the energy of the crowds. We wanted to create a really angry album." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{recording}} {{her debut}} studio album in 2005, Rihanna met Ne-Yo {{for the first}} time, {{but they could not}} collaborate on the album. She wanted to work with him since she heard [...] "Let Me Love You" [...] (2004) by Mario, which Ne-Yo wrote. When the production for A Girl like Me started, she considered working with him. She said, [...] "So for the second album, I was like, 'You know what? I have to work with that guy Ne-Yo.' So <b>we</b> <b>went</b> <b>into</b> the studio and we started working on this song." [...] Ne-Yo and Norwegian production duo Mikkel S. Eriksen and Tor Erik Hermansen collectively known as StarGate wrote [...] "Unfaithful", which Rihanna said was [...] "new ground for [...] " [...] because it was a ballad. It was produced by StarGate while Debbie Mounsey served as a production assistant. [...] "Unfaithful" [...] was recorded by Eriksen, Al Hemberger, Malcolm Pollack and Tiger Stylz at Battery and Avatar Studios in New York City, Loft Recording Studios in Bronxville and Digital Insight Recording Studios in Las Vegas. It was mixed by Phil Tan and Makeba Riddick provided the vocal production.|$|E
