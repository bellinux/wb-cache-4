5|$|Traditionally Luffa is held to {{have begun}} the {{building}} of Chichester Cathedral, the eastern section of which was dedicated in 1108. However, this view has been challenged by the art historian R. D. H. Gem, who argues {{that because of the}} conservative nature of the architecture it was more probably begun under Luffa's predecessor, Stigand, who was bishop from 1070 to 1087, and <b>who</b> <b>oversaw</b> <b>the</b> transfer of the seat of the bishopric from Selsey to Chichester. Most historians still incline to the belief that Luffa began the cathedral construction, however.|$|E
5|$|With the Arab {{government}} in Damascus destroyed and Faisal exiled, Hananu's rebels sought {{to compensate for}} the consequent loss of aid from the Arab government.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of Selvo's rule, he took over responsibility for the third construction of St. Mark's Basilica. This final and most famous version of the church, whose construction was begun by Domenico Contarini and finished by Vitale Faliero in 1094, remains an important symbol of the long periods of medieval Venetian wealth and power. The church is also {{a monument to the}} great Byzantine influence on Venetian art and culture throughout its history, but particularly in the 11th century. Though Selvo did not oversee {{the beginning}} or completion of St Mark's Basilica, his rule covered a longer period of its construction than the other two Doges <b>who</b> <b>oversaw</b> <b>the</b> project.|$|E

5|$|Diệm {{was killed}} in a November 1963 coup, {{allowing}} Thi to return to South Vietnam and resume his military service. Soon after arriving home, Thi found himself involved in another coup plot, acting as the link between Khánh and Đỗ Mậu, two generals disgruntled with their position under the military junta of Minh, <b>who</b> <b>oversaw</b> <b>the</b> overthrow of Diệm. Mau was one of the principal tacticians in the 1963 coup; although he did not command troops, he had a thorough knowledge of the backgrounds of the ARVN officers and their strengths, weaknesses and characteristics through his role as Diệm's director of military security, and this understanding had allowed him to engineer the previous coup. Minh's junta feared Mau's shrewdness and tried to sideline him by making him the Minister of Information, a relatively unimportant position.|$|E
5|$|Some of the translators {{hired to}} work on the books were {{well-known}} authors before their work on Harry Potter, such as Viktor Golyshev, <b>who</b> <b>oversaw</b> <b>the</b> Russian translation of the series' fifth book. The Turkish translation of books two to seven was undertaken by Sevin Okyay, a popular literary critic and cultural commentator. For reasons of secrecy, translation on a given book could only start after it had been released in English, leading to a lag of several months before the translations were available. This led to more and more copies of the English editions being sold to impatient fans in non-English speaking countries; for example, such was the clamour to read the fifth book that its English language edition became the first English-language book ever to top the best-seller list in France.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of the metric system into France in 1795 was done on a district by district basis with Paris being the first district, but by modern standards the transition was poorly managed. Although thousands of pamphlets were distributed, the Agency of Weights and Measures <b>who</b> <b>oversaw</b> <b>the</b> introduction underestimated the work involved. Paris alone needed 500,000 metre sticks, yet {{one month after the}} metre became the sole legal unit of measure, they only had 25,000 in store. This, combined with other excesses of the Revolution and the high level of illiteracy made the metric system unpopular.|$|E

5|$|Between 1703 and 1753, reducciones were {{established}} at San José and San Andrés on Lake Petén Itzá, Santa Ana {{just south of}} the lake, and at San Luis, Santo Toribio and Dolores in the south (not to be confused with Dolores del Lakandon). Each of these mission towns had its own minister who answered to the vicario general with the Spanish garrison at Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo. In {{the first decades of the}} 18th century, churches were built in five colonial towns: Dolores, Remedios, San Andrés, San José and Santo Toribio. The church in Dolores was built in 1708; the construction was probably overseen by Juan Antonio Ruiz y Bustamante. In 1699 there were nine priests in Petén but thereafter there was usually a shortage of clergy in colonial Petén. In spite of the objections of the Dominicans who had been working in southern Petén, the Franciscans continued to provide clergy from Yucatán, and it was the Franciscans <b>who</b> <b>oversaw</b> <b>the</b> spiritual welfare of Petén during the colonial period.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Ba Cụt was surrounded, {{and sought}} to make a peace deal with the Diệm {{government}} to avoid being taken prisoner. Ba Cụt {{sent a message to}} Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ, the public official <b>who</b> <b>oversaw</b> <b>the</b> civilian side of the campaign against the Hòa Hảo, asking for negotiations so that his men could be integrated into mainstream society and the nation's armed forces. Thơ agreed to meet Ba Cụt alone in the jungle, and despite fears that the meeting was a Hòa Hảo trap, he was not ambushed. However, Ba Cụt began asking for additional concessions and the meeting ended in a stalemate. According to historian Hue-Tam Ho Tai, Ba Cụt's lifelong antipathy towards Thơ's family influenced his behaviour during his last stand. Ba Cụt was arrested by a patrol on 13 April 1956, and his remaining forces were defeated in battle.|$|E
5|$|In 1370 the French made a {{successful}} attack on Portsmouth, commencing a new sequence of raids along the English coast. In due course first Edward, then Richard II, responded by improving the defences {{in the south}} of England. Part of this involved improving the condition of Southampton Castle, where, owing in part to the theft of building materials, including stone and lead, by the citizens of the town, the defences were in a poor condition. Henry Yevele, <b>who</b> <b>oversaw</b> <b>the</b> improvements to the castle, probably also constructed the Arcades along the western walls in 1380: this involved adopting the 1360 proposal to block up the properties along the western quay to form a solid wall, and adding three towers and gunports. Sir John Sondes and John Polymond were appointed by the king in 1386 to further improve the town walls, working with Sir John Arundel, the castle governor – Polymond and Arundel Towers were probably named after these men around this time.|$|E

5|$|The {{territory}} {{was first}} governed by William Henry Harrison <b>who</b> <b>oversaw</b> <b>the</b> negotiation with the native inhabitants to open {{large parts of}} the territory to settlement. In 1810 a popularly elected government was established as the territory continued to grow in population and develop a very basic road network, government, and education system. At the outbreak of Tecumseh's War, the territory was on the front line of battle and Harrison led a military force in the opening hostilities at the Battle of Tippecanoe, and then in the subsequent invasion of Canada during the War of 1812. Thomas Posey was appointed to the vacant governorship, but the opposition party, led by Congressman Jonathan Jennings, had dominance in the territorial affairs for its remaining years and began pressing for statehood. In June 1816, a constitutional convention was held and a state government was formed. The territory was dissolved on December 11, 1816, by an act of Congress granting statehood to Indiana.|$|E
5|$|In Cairo, an-Nasir Ahmad did not {{partake in}} the usual royal feast and the public prayer during the Eid al-Fitr holiday. He {{surrounded}} himself with his coterie of supporters from al-Karak, refused to meet directly with the Mamluk emirs of Egypt, avoided the public view, and was generally seclusive. He ordered Qawsun and Altunbugha {{as well as the}} governor of Qus <b>who</b> <b>oversaw</b> <b>the</b> execution of Abu Bakr to be executed. He assigned many of his unqualified supporters from al-Karak to senior administrative offices, to the chagrin of the Mamluk emirs in Egypt. Tashtamur played an integral role in an-Nasir Ahmad's administration. However, Tashtamur's arbitrary conduct in office and his selective approach to an-Nasir Ahmad's orders turned the latter against him, and with support from the leading Mamluk emirs who were also frustrated with Tashtamur, an-Nasir Ahmad had Tashtamur imprisoned in May 1342. In addition, an-Nasir Ahmad ordered Qutlubugha to be confined to Damascus, while Mamluk emirs in Egypt sought to eliminate Qutlubugha. The latter was able to leave Egypt unharmed, but before reaching Beisan from Jenin, he was arrested by the governor of Safad, Baybars al-Ahmadi, who extradited him to Egypt.|$|E
5|$|On 3 September 1939, {{two days}} after Germany invaded Poland {{triggering}} the Second World War, began the evacuation of the most precious national treasures, including Szczerbiec, from the Wawel Castle. The cargo was transported on barges, wagons, buses and trucks to Romania. From there, it was shipped by sea to France and later to Britain. On the way from Bordeaux to Falmouth, the ship carrying Polish national treasures came under fire from the Luftwaffe. Karol Estreicher, <b>who</b> <b>oversaw</b> <b>the</b> evacuation, decided then to remove Szczerbiec from a chest and sandwich it between two wooden planks, and to attach to them an explanatory message in a bottle – {{so that in the}} event that the ship was sunk, at least the coronation sword could be salvaged. When the German bombing of Britain began in July 1940, the valuables were transported aboard the Polish ocean liner MS Batory to Canada and finally deposited at the Polish consulate and then other locations in Ottawa. After the war, one of the custodians of the national treasures, who remained loyal to the London-based Polish government-in-exile, was reluctant to return them to Poland, which had fallen under communist rule and Soviet influence. After lengthy negotiations, the first batch of the most important objects, including Szczerbiec, was ultimately returned in 1959; the rest followed in 1961. Since then, the Polish coronation sword has been on permanent display in the treasure vault of the Wawel Castle.|$|E
