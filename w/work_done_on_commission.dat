50|$|A last {{genre of}} Paw Oo Thet are the <b>works</b> he <b>did</b> <b>on</b> <b>commission</b> to {{illustrate}} stories in magazines, book covers, and texts of {{books such as}} The Orange-Robed Boy, written in English by Patricia Wallace Garlan and Marjarene Dunstan (1967). In this book, 21 of his watercolor illustrations lavished the text. His commissioned work for books such as this or for the writings of other authors, oddly, seem to be {{some of his most}} imaginatively inspired watercolor. In The Orange-Robed Boy, Kingman's influence of a free and open composition sometimes appeared, but if the text was in Burmese and the theme he was illustrating was of a strong traditional bent, he might reach back to the techniques of Traditional painting to <b>do</b> the <b>works.</b>|$|R
40|$|Between 1900 and 1930, social {{scientists}} attempted to refashion social ethics by conducting extensive social research. Some of them collaborated with Herbert Hoover {{before and after}} he became president. In the 1920 s, they accepted positions on Herbert Hoover's various <b>commissions.</b> The <b>work</b> they <b>did</b> <b>on</b> these <b>commissions</b> made them a forum for manifesting their interest in modernizing social ethics. At {{one and the same}} time, they were in a position to define both social ethics and the purpose of the social sciences. Throughout this dissertation, I explore the cases of three {{social scientists}} involved with Hoover's commissions: the economist Wesley Clair Mitchell, the political scientist Charles Edward Merriam, and the industrial researcher and social worker Mary van Kleeck. Wesley Clair Mitchell addressed issues of American consumption and economic behaviour. Charles Edward Merriam analyzed the political behaviour of American citizens. Mary van Kleeck surveyed labour relations between American workers and employers. In this dissertation, I have employed methods developed by intellectual historians, focussing on the published and unpublished papers that these social experts and Herbert Hoover himself produced. This collaboration between Hoover and some of the most prominent social scientists of the day explains the ambitious project they undertook, that of adjusting social ethics to the modern living conditions they had discovered while carrying out their social research. In so doing, they sought to adapt the traditional code of conduct of most Americans to the new circumstances that prevailed in {{the first decades of the}} twentieth century...|$|R
