25|$|Basically, an {{information}} society is {{the means of}} getting information {{from one place to}} another (Wark, 1997, p.22). As technology has become more advanced over time so too has the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> adapted in sharing this information with each other.|$|E
25|$|In A1, if we {{view the}} number n'm as the {{function}} type m→n, and m'n as the application m(n), we can reinterpret the numbers i, j, ĵ, and ioĵ as functions of type i:(m→2)→2, j:m→((n→2)→2), ĵ:(n→2)→(m→2), and ioĵ:(n→2)→2. The definition (ioĵ)v= i'ĵ'v in A1 then translates to (ioĵ)(v)= i(ĵ(v)), that is, ioĵ is defined to be composition of i and ĵ understood as functions. So {{the content of}} A1 amounts to defining term application to be essentially composition, modulo the need to transpose the m-tuple j to make the types match up suitably for composition. This composition is the one in Lawvere's previously mentioned category of power sets and their functions. In this <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> translated the commuting diagrams of that category, as the equational theory of Boolean algebras, into the equational consequences of A1 as the logical representation of that particular composition law.|$|E
25|$|In {{mathematical}} terms, the Hausdorff dimension generalizes {{the notion}} of the dimension of a real vector space. That is, the Hausdorff dimension of an n-dimensional inner product space equals n. This underlies the earlier statement that the Hausdorff dimension of a point is zero, of a line is one, etc., and that irregular sets can have noninteger Hausdorff dimensions. For instance, the Koch curve summarized earlier is constructed from an equilateral triangle; in each iteration, its component line segments are divided into 3 segments of unit length, the newly created middle segment is used as the base of a new equilateral triangle that points outward, and this base segment is then deleted to leave a final object from the iteration of unit length of 4. That is, after the first iteration, each original line segment has been replaced with N=4, where each self-similar copy is 1/S = 1/3 as long as the original. Stated another <b>way,</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> taken an object with Euclidean dimension, D, and reduced its linear scale by 1/3 in each direction, so that its length increases to N=SD. This equation is easily solved for D, yielding the ratio of logarithms (or natural logarithms) appearing in the figures, and giving—in the Koch and other fractal cases—non-integer dimensions for these objects.|$|E

500|$|In October 2012, Hedren {{said that}} {{although}} she believed the film accurately portrays Hitchcock's negative behaviour towards her, the time constraints of a 90-minute film prevented telling the entire story of her career with him.

500|$|After a {{game against}} Queens Park Rangers at Loftus Road in September 2010, manager Kenny Jackett said Millwall's {{hooligan}} problems are {{to a certain extent}} exaggerated by media sensationalism. [...] "I see it as unjust. We are an easy club to criticise and in my time , the <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> been reported is unfair", he said. Other examples of this include archive footage of their hooligan element's past bad behaviour being shown, when disorder has occurred at other grounds, not involving them. During a game between Millwall and Huddersfield Town, The Observer reported that a Huddersfield Town fan had thrown a coin at a linesman, and that some Millwall fans had intervened, and handed the culprit over to police. The News of the World, however, bore the headline: [...] "Millwall Thugs Deck Linesman With Concrete". This has led to a siege mentality among supporters of the club, which gave rise to the Millwall fans' famous terrace chant, No one likes us, we don't care, being sung in defiant defence of themselves and their team. In April 2013, Millwall met Wigan Athletic in a semi-final of the FA Cup. Millwall lost the game 2–0. Towards the end of the match, violence broke out in part of the stand allocated to Millwall, with individuals fighting amongst themselves and then against police, resulting in 14 arrests, of which two were Wigan supporters. In January 2014, a Millwall fan ripped a linesman's flag after a corner was not given to his side during {{a game against}} Leicester City; Millwall lost 1–3.|$|E

Galbraith of Otaku2.com {{compared}} {{the design of}} OZ to Takashi Murakami's artwork, specifically [...] "the flatness, or slick, polished surfaces" [...] and then contrasted them with the sequences in Nagano noting, [...] "it has a warm and lived in feel to it, aided by a scrupulous attention to detail." [...] Of the story and characters Galbraith wrote that [...] "scenes such as the large family coming together and talking over dinner are heartwarming and hilarious." [...] and {{compared the}} movie to [...] "a moving picture book, a family photo album turned back a few decades." [...] He also noted the audience response, reporting sold-out screenings two nights in a row, and highlighting handwritten notes left at the theater by [...] "hoardes of fans who on the spot {{decided to move to}} Nagano" [...] In conclusion, Galbraith wrote [...] "there is an innocence and purity to this work that really reminds [...] of Miyazaki Hayao and Studio Ghibli back in the day, and the stellar backgrounds invoke Shinkai Makoto." [...] Justin Sevakis of Anime News Network gave the film an 'A' rating and wrote that [...] "decades from now, Summer Wars will be seen as the official arrival of [...] Mamoru Hosoda into the realm of historically important anime directors." [...] He called the film [...] "a near-perfect blend of social satire and science fiction, at once timely and timeless, sardonic and optimistic." [...] and noted that the film is [...] "practically overflowing with sharp social insight in a <b>way</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> not seen from anime in years." [...] Sevakis praised Yoshiyuki Sadamoto's character designs and highlighted the visuals as [...] "sharp and consistently great". In summing the film up he called Summer Wars [...] "Incredibly entertaining, and intriguingly intelligent. Accessible and fast-paced. Pretty much perfect." [...] Similarities have been commented on between the film and a previous work of Hosoda, [...] Neo magazine has stated that Our War Game is [...] "plainly a prototype" [...] of Summer Wars.|$|E
