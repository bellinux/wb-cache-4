These thoughts constantly recur, and it requires a tremendous mental effort to concentrate on useful and progressive tasks.|$|E
25|$|For all its {{usefulness}} in resolving questions regarding infinite sets, naive set theory has some fatal flaws. In particular, it is prey to logical paradoxes {{such as those}} exposed by Russell's paradox. The discovery of these paradoxes revealed that not all sets which {{can be described in}} the language of naive set theory can actually be said to exist without creating a contradiction. The 20th century saw a resolution to these paradoxes {{in the development of the}} various axiomatizations of set theories such as ZFC and NBG in common use today. However, the gap between the very formalized and symbolic language of these theories and our typical informal use of mathematical language results in various paradoxical situations, as well as the philosophical question of exactly <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> such formal systems actually propose to be talking about.|$|E

500|$|Abrams's {{inspiration}} for Fringe {{came from a}} range of sources, including the writings of Michael Crichton, the film Altered States, films by David Cronenberg, and the television series The X-Files and The Twilight Zone. Orci stated that Fringe is a [...] "new kind of storytelling", combining procedural shows such as Law & Order, and an [...] "extremely serialized and very culty" [...] series like Lost. The procedural aspect was chosen because, {{at the time of its}} premiere, six of the ten top shows were procedural in nature; Orci stated that [...] "you have to be a fool not to go study <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they're doing". Abrams had originally considered naming the series The Lab, as they had envisioned Walter's laboratory to be [...] "the epicenter of the conversation", and where [...] "anything is possible".|$|E
500|$|The Spectators {{literary}} reviewer, Anita Brookner, {{based on}} her reading of the novel in the original French, described the book as a [...] "masterly novel...diabolically (and I use the word advisedly) clever. It is also impressive, not merely {{as an act of}} impersonation but perhaps above all for the fiendish diligence with which it is carried out...presuppose(s) formidable research {{on the part of the}} author, who is American, educated in France and writing fluent, idiomatic and purposeful French. This tour de force, which not everyone will welcome, outclasses all other fictions and will continue to do so for some time to come. No summary can do it justice." [...] The Observer 's Paris correspondent, Jason Burke, praised the book as an [...] "extraordinary Holocaust novel asks <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> turns normal people into mass killers," [...] adding that [...] "notwithstanding the controversial subject matter, this is an extraordinarily powerful novel." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} its sexually {{explicit}} nature, the singer responded: [...] "Erm, yeah. I guess {{a part of}} me wanted to be truthful about <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> really drives me, and maybe give back to the place that is nourishing me... I don't know what to say. When I read books or see films or listen to albums I want certain things. I want a heart—I'm very old school like that, I'm very emotional... I just didn't want anybody to know. I wanted it for myself. The lyric to 'Cocoon' was a whole diary, then I had to edit 90 per cent of it out. It's very hard to explain, but when I read it and the other person it's about reads it, we don't feel abused or anything. I think there's songs where I've been more... scruffy about what I'm expressing. I have a problem with music that's too indulgent. It's like 'Keep your own dirty laundry, please'".|$|E

50|$|Whether Jethro {{went to the}} {{wilderness}} {{before or after the}} Torah was given, and consequently <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> induced him to go to {{the wilderness}}, are disputed points among the ancient rabbis (Zeb. 116a; Yer. Meg. i. 11; Mek. l.c.). According to some, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the giving of the Torah; according to others, the crossing of the Red Sea dry-shod, or the falling of the manna.|$|R
2500|$|The {{writer and}} critic Samuel Johnson wrote that Paradise Lost shows off [...] " [...] {{peculiar}} power to astonish" [...] and that [...] " [...] {{seems to have}} been well acquainted with his own genius, and to know <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Nature had bestowed upon him more bountifully than upon others: the power of displaying the vast, illuminating the splendid, enforcing the awful, darkening the gloomy, and aggravating the dreadful." ...|$|R
500|$|The album {{features}} aggressive multi-tracking of D'Angelo's voice, {{a technique}} {{similar to the}} production of Sly & the Family Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On (1971) and Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On (1973). The multi-tracking on Voodoo significantly affected the clarity of D'Angelo's vocals. In Voodoos liner notes, Saul Williams wrote of its heavy use of multi-tracking, stating [...] "You might respond, 'Lyrics? Yo, I can't even understand half the shit that D'Angelo be saying. That nigga sounds like Bobby McFerrin on opium'. And I'd say, 'You're right. Neither can I. But I am drawn to figure out <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he's saying. His vocal collaging intrigues me'". Music writers have also noted the production style and sound of Voodoo as reminiscent of the sound of the P-Funk opus Mothership Connection (1975), Gaye's downtempo disco-soul record I Want You (1976), and Miles Davis's jazz fusion works In a Silent Way (1969) and Bitches Brew (1970).|$|E
500|$|Over the years, Nielsen {{wrote the}} music for over 290 songs and hymns, most of them for verses and poems by {{well-known}} Danish authors such as N. F. S. Grundtvig, Ingemann, Poul Martin Møller, Adam Oehlenschläger and Jeppe Aakjær. In Denmark, {{many of them are}} still popular today both with adults and children. They are regarded as [...] "the most representative part of the country's most representative composer's output". In 1906, Nielsen had explained the significance of such songs to his countrymen:With certain melodic inflections we Danes unavoidably think of the poems of, for example, Ingemann, Christian Winther or Drachmann, and we often seem to perceive the smell of Danish landscapes and rural images in our songs and music. But {{it is also clear that}} a foreigner, who knows neither our countryside, nor our painters, our poets, or our history in the same intimate way as we do ourselves, will be completely unable to grasp <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> brings us to hear and tremble with sympathetic understanding.|$|E
500|$|With Election Special, Cooder {{wanted to}} write an album with direct lyrics and {{encourage}} urgency in listeners during the US presidential election of 2012. He felt that the election season was [...] "the time of decision in this country... the most critical {{time in the history}} of the country". When asked about concerns over [...] "", Cooder said in an interview for the Los Angeles Times, [...] "I thought I should have a record that says, 'This here record is for you during election time.' Rather than be vague and poetic, let's just call this <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>That</b> way I may get people's attention. That's the idea." [...] Cooder drew on music he grew up listening to such as Depression-era songs and sought to appropriate contemporary subject matter to them. When writing the album, he also touched on the Occupy movement, which he felt optimistic about, saying that [...] "There's a sign of something. Those people are having conversations, and the conversations become issues and the issues become talked about. Pretty soon, the rest of the world picks up on it, even the politicians." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{fact that}} Tucker goes free upholds {{a common theme}} in Homicide: Life on the Street – that life is not always fair, and that criminals {{sometimes}} get away with their crimes, a conviction that often put the show's producers at odds with NBC executives. Fontana deliberately wrote the script {{so that it would}} remain ambiguous whether Tucker committed the murder or not. He wanted the character to have a genuine feeling of love for Adena Watson, but the strong feelings do not specifically mean he killed the girl. Braugher praised Fontana for creating such a three-dimensional character in Tucker, and said, [...] "Fontana's genius is that we are never quite certain as to <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we have on our hands." [...] Fontana also wanted Pembleton and Bayliss to have different interpretations of the same interrogation; Bayliss begins the interview convinced of the man's guilt and becomes uncertain by the end, and Pembleton has the opposite experience. Multiple police departments have requested copies of [...] "Three Men and Adena" [...] for use in training sessions due to its accurate portrayal of the intricacies of the police interrogation process. The interrogation included several police tactics not typically featured in television dramas, including the presentation of false evidence in an attempt to get a confession.|$|E
500|$|On April 2, 2014, the News Journal {{reported}} that Bevin {{spoke at a}} pro-cockfighting rally in Corbin, Kentucky. Asked about his attendance, Bevin said he understood that the rally was a states' rights event: [...] "I {{was the first person}} to speak and then I left." [...] Organizers of the event, which was closed to the media, said there was [...] "never any ambiguity" [...] regarding its purpose, and WAVE in Louisville published an undercover video from the event showing that Bevin was the third speaker; the speaker who immediately preceded Bevin said the rally was held [...] "for the sole purpose of legalizing gamecock fighting at the state level." [...] Bevin told a WAVE reporter, [...] "I honestly wasn't even paying attention. I was thinking about what I was going to say. I don't even remember him saying that." [...] The WAVE video also showed an attendee asking Bevin if he would support the legalization of cockfighting in Kentucky, to which he replied, [...] "I support the people of Kentucky exercising their right, because it is our right to decide <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> we want to do, and not the federal government's. Criminalizing behavior, if it's part of the heritage of this state, is in my opinion a bad idea. A bad idea. I will not support it." [...] Bevin was referencing the Agricultural Act of 2014, commonly called the [...] "farm bill", which contained a provision that criminalized spectators at cockfighting events.|$|E
500|$|Much of Ianto's {{character}} development is centred on the character's relationship with Captain Jack. On the character's evolution from minor character to romantic interest, Gareth David-Lloyd has commented that [...] "To have a storyline where you're {{involved with the}} leading character for any actor is awesome." [...] On the character's development, David-Lloyd has said that through Jack's relationship, [...] "he's found his meaning and ... he's happier." [...] Asked <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Ianto receives from Jack, David-Lloyd responds [...] "Support, meaning. I think he lost meaning. He was tortured and Jack gave him that meaning back. And reliability that he'll always be there, I think." [...] John Barrowman and Gareth David-Lloyd have also opined that Jack's relationship with Ianto has however brought out Jack's empathy, and helped to ground him, with John Barrowman reported as saying that Ianto [...] "brings out the 'human' in him, it brings out more of the empathy because he's actually fallen for someone and he really cares about somebody. So, it's really great and I think that's what makes him warm to other people. It makes him more approachable." [...] In the same interview, Gareth David-Lloyd said of the relationship and his character that [...] "I think Ianto's always made him care and that is really {{the heart of the}} show. Ianto's always bearing his emotional side and vulnerable side and keeping his feet on the ground. I think of all the characters, he's the one who tries to keep everyone else's feet on the ground. He brings everyone back to reality, often with a dry, witty remark or taking a dig at somebody just to sort of bring people back down." ...|$|E
