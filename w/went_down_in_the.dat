5|$|During {{the early}} rounds, Garcia {{steadily}} pulled ahead, outboxing Judah throughout. Judah was {{in serious trouble}} in rounds 5 and 6, then finally <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 8th. From there, things took a surprising turn. Never known for his resolve or ability to turn the fight around late, Judah responded to the knockdown by coming on strong down the stretch. Judah took the last 3 rounds, though his deficit from earlier in the fight meant it wasn't enough and Garcia defeated Judah by unanimous decision (115-112, 114-112, 116-111).|$|E
5|$|In early August, Lerch and U-12 set {{out from}} Pola for Venice to look for enemy ships to sink. On 6 August, the Italian {{destroyer}} Rosolino Pilo rammed U-12, probably by chance, at about 05:00 in the Lido inlet of the Venetian Lagoon. Two days later, when Italian workers were dredging to try to determine the object Rosolino Pilo had hit, they heard a heavy explosion. When divers <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area, they discovered the wreck of U-12 with her stern blown off. U-12s entire complement of 17 men was lost when she went down. U-12 was the first Austro-Hungarian submarine sunk during the war.|$|E
5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the restart, Liverpool had the first attack. Striker Michael Owen went past United defender Brown, but {{he was unable to}} shoot when the ball got stuck in between his feet. A minute later, Liverpool had an appeal for a penalty after striker Emile Heskey <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United penalty area, but referee Paul Durkin did not award a penalty. They had another chance in the 52nd minute after an exchange of passes between Murphy and Heskey, but Murphy's shot went over the bar. United began to exert more pressure on Liverpool after this. A minute later a shot by Keane was blocked by Liverpool defender Sami Hyypiä. The ball went out for a United, which resulted in a throw-in, that was headed into the arms of Dudek. Five minutes later, Van Nistelrooy had a chance to score as he turned and shot at the Liverpool goal, but it was saved by Dudek. Heskey was replaced by striker Milan Baroš following an injury.|$|E

5|$|On 6 March 1944, Jimmy Doolittle ordered 730 bombers to bomb Berlin for {{the first}} time. They were escorted by 644 fighters from 8th Air Force, 9th Air Force and the RAF. The Commander of I. Jagdkorps {{requested}} and received reinforcements from II. Jagdkorps and 7 Jagd-Division. Oesau led Stab./JG 1 and I./JG 1, Major Bär led II./JG 1, and accompanied by I./JG 11 and III./JG 54 they initially intercepted sixteen B-17s of 100th Bomb Group who were escorted by P-47s of the 78th Group. Ten B-17s <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first wave, and in several waves of attacks on the bombers from multiple directions most of the pilots ended up exhausting their ammunition, resulting in twenty bombers being shot down in the 25 minutes before the escorting P-47s arrived.|$|E
5|$|Ray Parlour and Henry {{came off}} {{in the second half}} for Robert Pirès and Sylvain Wiltord. United created an early chance, but Van Nistelrooy was unable {{to make the most of}} Giggs' delivery. The player <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> penalty area under the {{challenge}} of Campbell, prompting United players to appeal for a penalty; however, referee Steve Bennett decided to let play continue. Arsenal countered twice thereafter, but their attacks broke down on both counts. Vieira, Scholes and Quinton Fortune were booked for tackles during a 10-minute spell. Both clubs made substitutions in the midway point of the second half: for Arsenal, Bergkamp, Gilberto and Ljungberg were replaced by Francis Jeffers, Edu and Giovanni van Bronckhorst, whereas for United, Butt and Fortune came off for Eric Djemba-Djemba and John O'Shea. In the 72nd minute, Jeffers was shown a red card for kicking out at Neville. Ferguson brought on striker Diego Forlán for Neville six minutes later. Djemba-Djemba avoided a yellow card for his challenge on Campbell in the 80th minute; Bennett deemed it unintentional.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{minutes into}} the second half, Juventus {{equalised}}: Claudio Marchisio back-heeled the ball to right-back Stephan Lichtsteiner, who set up Carlos Tevez. Barcelona goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen blocked the shot from Tevez, but Álvaro Morata equalised by putting the rebound into the net. In the 67th minute, Juventus appealed for a penalty when Paul Pogba <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> area when challenged by Dani Alves, but the referee did not give it. Two minutes later, Barcelona {{got back into the}} lead when Lionel Messi shot {{from the edge of the}} area, Gianluigi Buffon blocked it and Suárez put in the rebound. Soon after, Neymar put the ball into the net from Alba's cross, but it was disallowed as the referee deemed that Neymar had headed it into his own hand.|$|E

5|$|Green-flag pit stops {{began on}} lap 48. Edwards and Biffle made pit stops on lap 49, handing {{the lead to}} Riggs. Hornish hit the turn-two outside wall on the {{following}} lap after his right-front tire <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tri-oval, and sustained damage to his right-front quarter panel, but no debris came off his car. After the pit stops, Edwards regained the lead and held a five-second lead over Kyle Busch; Martin moved into third place, Riggs regained fourth place, and Harvick moved up to fifth place by lap 65. Three laps later, a second caution was needed when debris was spotted at turn-two. Most of the leaders, including Edwards, made pit stops. Jeff Burton chose {{to remain on the}} track and led on the lap-75 restart, ahead of Earnhardt and Kyle Busch. On lap 78, Kyle Busch moved ahead of Earnhardt to take second place and began to close the gap to Burton. Kyle Busch passed Burton to reclaim the lead three laps later, and opened up a 1.3-second advantage over Burton by the 92nd lap. Earnhardt was passed by Edwards for fifth place on lap 94 and Biffle got ahead of Gordon for seventh on the same lap. Edwards gained fourth place when he passed Stewart on the 96th lap, and Burton lost second to Kenseth two laps later. On lap 102, Burton fell to fourth place after Edwards passed him.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{kicked off}} the second half, but it was Chelsea who had the first attack. Chelsea defender Ashley Cole had space in the Liverpool penalty area, but his pass to Juan Mata was intercepted by the Liverpool defence. They {{subsequently}} went on the attack and won a corner, but {{the ball into the}} Chelsea penalty area by Bellamy was cleared. Liverpool continued to attack, but were denied a penalty in the 50th minute, when Gerrard <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chelsea penalty area. The ball was subsequently put back into the Chelsea penalty area by Downing, but Henderson could only head the ball to Chelsea players. Liverpool were made to rue their missed chances, as two minutes later Chelsea had extended their lead. Lampard got away from Spearing and passed to Drogba {{on the edge of the}} Liverpool penalty area, he advanced past Liverpool defender Martin Škrtel and shot through the legs of Reina and into the Liverpool goal to make the score 2–0. Liverpool went on the offensive after the Chelsea goal. A Suárez shot was saved by Čech and manager Kenny Dalglish replaced midfielder Spearing with striker Andy Carroll. The substation worked, as in the 64th minute Carroll had scored. Downing won a tackle on the left hand side of the pitch, which resulted in the ball breaking to Carroll. His subsequent shot beat Čech in the Chelsea goal to reduce the deficit to 2–1.|$|E

After attacking for most of the match, United went 1–0 down to an Ian Cameron penalty, and things looked even worse as Cameron <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> box with minutes remaining. But a second penalty wasn't given and United desperately pushed for the all important equaliser.|$|E
25|$|Adam Air {{is being}} sued by Indonesian {{consumer}} and labour groups over the accident, {{for a total}} of one trillion rupiahs (US$100 million), to be paid {{to the families of the}} victims. According to a lawyer for the families, speaking in a press conference along with the secretary for the Adam Air KI-574 Passengers' Families Association (formed in the aftermath of the disaster), 30 of the victims' families intend to sue Boeing instead of Adam Air over the accident. However, this does not necessarily mean that all of the others will sue Adam Air, as they may not necessarily exercise their right to sue at all. Representatives of the families have explained that they believe the plane was brought down by a faulty rudder control valve although there is no evidence that proves this, similarly to the accidents involving United Airlines Flight 585 and USAir Flight 427, which <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1990s. They have explained that, as a result, they are suing Boeing and Parker Hannifin, the valve's manufacturer, although airlines using the 737 have been warned about problems with the rudder control valves.|$|E

500|$|Flying {{accidents}} were commonplace at training establishments and No.8 SFTS was no exception; taxiing collisions, crash landings in {{the surrounding}} cane fields, and runway overshoots were regular occurrences. At least two aircraft were damaged each month {{in the early part}} of 1942. The school's first fatality, however, was from drowning, when staff were called out to assist victims of local flooding in February, and an aircraftman died during an attempted rescue. On 1June 1942, an Anson crashed into the sea off Bargara, near Bundaberg; the pilot and two crew were reported as missing, believed killed. Three more aircrew were lost when an Anson apparently <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sea on 5October. On 25February 1943, an Anson crashed during a night-flying exercise, killing both pilots. [...] The school suffered a ground fatality on 25April 1944, when a mechanic walked into the spinning propeller of an Anson he was servicing. Two more pilots were killed when an Anson dived into the ground on 8December, following an apparent structural failure.|$|E
500|$|Midfielder Gilberto Silva {{made his}} {{debut in the}} second half, coming on in place of fellow Brazilian Edu. In the 47th minute, Henry went close to scoring his first goal at the Millennium Stadium; he {{collected}} a pass from Bergkamp and used his pace {{to get past the}} Liverpool defence. His shot caught Dudek and rebounded off the post. Henry created further chances in the 51st and 54th minutes, forcing more saves from the Liverpool goalkeeper. Owen was unable to reach the ball from a corner and Liverpool continued to pressure Arsenal, with Gerrard regaining control of the midfield and making a substitution which saw Danny Murphy come on for Hamann. In spite of this, it was Arsenal who scored the opening goal, in the 68th minute. A move by Liverpool, which had broken down, allowed Gilberto to pass the ball out to Ashley Cole, who in turn fed Bergkamp. His cut-back met the Brazilian's left foot [...] "with a shot that squeezed through Dudek's legs." [...] Diouf <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> penalty box four minutes after, which provoked a reaction by Vieira, who believed he had dived. Both managers made numerous changes in the final 15 minutes, which included Milan Baroš replacing Heskey and midfielder Kolo Touré on for Bergkamp. The final notable chance went to Liverpool a minute before additional time: Sol Campbell was caught out of position in Arsenal's half, but Diouf's shot went over the goal bar.|$|E

500|$|After 97 {{days with}} the [...] "Iron" [...] {{he moved on to}} Coventry City for a £60,000 fee, after impressing in a reserve team game between the two clubs. The {{management}} team of George Curtis and John Sillett offered Houchen £350 a week, £50 an appearance, a £10,000 signing-on fee, as well the chance to play First Division football. He struggled with injuries {{at the start of the}} 1986–87 campaign, but recovered to ensure his name <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> club's history for his exploits in the FA Cup. He bagged five goals in their 1986–87 cup-winning run, the first being the winning goal away at Old Trafford against Alex Ferguson's Manchester United. He then scored two against Sheffield Wednesday in the quarter-finals, and one against Leeds United in the semi-finals, both games being held at Hillsborough. The final and most famous goal of the run came in the 1987 FA Cup Final in front of 98,000 spectators at Wembley Stadium in a 3–2 win over Tottenham Hotspur. However Houchen almost missed the match after catching food poisoning from a trout caught by reserve goalkeeper Jake Findlay. The goal came from a Dave Bennett cross and was an instinctive full-stretch diving header that was impossible for Ray Clemence to save. It levelled the score at 2–2 on 63 minutes, and an own goal from Gary Mabbutt in extra time won the game for Coventry. As well as his FA Cup winning medal, Houchen's header also earned him the BBC Match of the Day's Goal of the Season award for the 1986–87 season. This was due to the acrobatic effort involved and partly due to the incredible run he had made from deep midfield to meet the crossed ball. It is generally considered as one of the most famous goals scored at Wembley, and certainly the best headed goal.|$|E
500|$|Regarded {{as one of}} the RAAF's most skilful {{cross-country}} {{pilots and}} navigators, Eaton came to public attention as leader of three military expeditions to find lost aircraft in Central Australia between 1929 and 1931. In April 1929, he coordinated the Air Force's part in the search for aviators Keith Anderson and Bob Hitchcock, missing in their aircraft the Kookaburra while themselves looking for Charles Kingsford Smith and Charles Ulm, who had force landed the Southern Cross in north Western Australia during a flight from Sydney. Three of the RAAF's five [...] "ancient" [...] DH.9 biplanes <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> search—though all crews escaped injury—including Eaton's, which experienced what he labelled [...] "a good crash" [...] on 21April near Tennant Creek after the engine's pistons melted. The same day, Captain Lester Brain, flying a Qantas aircraft, located the wreck of the Kookaburra in the Tanami Desert, approximately [...] east-south-east of Wave Hill. Setting out from Wave Hill on 23April, Eaton led a ground party across rough terrain that reached the crash site four days later and buried the crew, who had perished of thirst and exposure. Not a particularly religious man, he recalled that after the burial he saw a perfect cross formed by cirrus cloud in an otherwise clear blue sky above the Kookaburra. The Air Board described the RAAF's search as taking 240 hours flying time [...] "under the most trying conditions...where a forced landing meant certain crash". In November 1930, Eaton was selected to lead another expedition for a missing aircraft near Ayers Rock, but it was called off soon afterwards when the pilot showed up in Alice Springs. The next month, he was ordered to search for W.L. Pittendrigh and S.J. Hamre, who had disappeared in the biplane Golden Quest2 while attempting to discover Lasseter's Reef. Employing a total of four DH.60 Moths, the RAAF team located the missing men near Dashwood Creek on 7January 1931, and they were rescued four days later by a ground party accompanied by Eaton. Staying in nearby Alice Springs, he recommended a site for the town's new airfield, which was approved and has remained in use since its construction.|$|E
