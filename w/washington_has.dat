5|$|After his career, <b>Washington</b> <b>has</b> {{complained of}} {{treatment}} {{he has received}} in relation to his punching of Tomjanovich. <b>Washington</b> <b>has</b> sought to portray himself {{as a victim of}} the fight and appears to have exaggerated some of the misfortunes that came his way as a result of it. Washington told The New York Times that he has been refused work as a coach time and again. However, Tom Davis hired him as an assistant coach at Stanford, and Davis wanted to bring him to Iowa when he went to coach there. Washington stayed at Stanford and later quit his assistant coaching position, and he subsequently worked as strength and conditioning coach for the Portland Trail Blazers.|$|E

2500|$|Immediately after Washington's death, {{rumors about}} how Washington died began to surface. On January 6, 1988, Dr. Antonio Senat, Washington's {{personal}} physician, denied [...] "unfounded speculations" [...] that <b>Washington</b> <b>had</b> cocaine {{in his system}} {{at the time of}} his death, or that foul play was involved. Cook County Medical Examiner Robert J. Stein performed an autopsy on Washington and concluded that <b>Washington</b> <b>had</b> died of a heart attack. <b>Washington</b> <b>had</b> weighed , and suffered from hypertension, high cholesterol levels, and an enlarged heart. On June 20, 1988, Alton Miller again indicated that drug reports on <b>Washington</b> <b>had</b> come back negative, and that <b>Washington</b> <b>had</b> not been poisoned prior to his death. Dr. Stein stated that the only drug in Washington's system had been lidocaine, which is used to stabilize the heart after a heart attack takes place. The drug was given to Washington either by paramedics, or by doctors at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Coincidentally, Bernard Epton, Washington's opponent in the 1983 general election, followed him in death just 18 days later, on December 13, 1987.|$|R

5|$|Mount <b>Washington</b> <b>has</b> {{been the}} subject of several famous paintings, part of a New England school of art known as White Mountain art.

Train service in the area spurred increased tourism and the construction of the Glen House where Albert Bierstadt and his photographer brother (Bierstadt Brothers) stayed. John P. Soule, John B.

5|$|The Cascadia {{subduction}} zone rarely influences the western portion of Washington state, but the November 1873 M7.3 shock near the California–Oregon border {{may have been}} associated with it. Although activity in the Pacific Northwest (especially west of the Cascades in <b>Washington)</b> <b>has</b> occasionally been located near the {{subduction zone}}, earthquakes there (1949 Olympia, 1965 Puget Sound, 2001 Nisqually) have mostly been intraslab events. A large M7 earthquake on the Seattle Fault in 900 C.E. may have generated a tsunami in Puget Sound. The 1872 event east of the Cascades is not understood well {{due to the lack of}} instrumental records and reliable felt intensity reports.|$|E

5|$|<b>Washington</b> <b>has</b> had a {{significant}} African American population since the city's foundation. African American residents composed about 30% of the District's total population between 1800 and 1940.

Partly {{as a result of}} gentrification, there was a 31.4% increase in the non-Hispanic white population and an 11.5% decrease in the black population between 2000 and 2010.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, twenty-one {{northwest}} Washington tribes, {{joined by}} the United States filed a Request for Determination in U.S. District Court, asking the court {{to find that the}} State of <b>Washington</b> <b>has</b> a treaty-based duty to preserve fish runs and habitat sufficiently for the tribes to earn a “moderate living,” and sought to compel the state to repair or replace culverts that impede salmon migration. On August 22, 2007, the district court issued a summary judgment order, holding that while culverts impeding andromadous fish migration are not the only factor diminishing their upstream habitat, in building and maintaining culverts that impede salmon migration, Washington State had diminished the size of salmon runs within the case area and thereby violated its obligation under the Stevens Treaties. On March 29, 2013, the court issued an injunction ordering the state to significantly increase the effort for removing state-owned culverts that block habitat for salmon and steelhead, and to replace the state-owned culverts that have the greatest adverse impact on the habitat of andromadous fish by 2030.|$|E
