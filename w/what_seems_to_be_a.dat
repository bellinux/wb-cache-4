5|$|The {{game has}} two endings, a good ending {{and a bad}} ending. The good ending can only be {{achieved}} by completing secret minigames, in which various animatronic characters bring a cake to <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sorrowful child's soul. This ending is thought {{to imply that the}} souls of the murdered children have been set free, although connoted meanings are disputed.|$|E
5|$|The Child has curly {{blond hair}} and sits on a white cloth, {{animated}} and upright, {{at the side of}} the Virgin's lap. Like Mary, his body is shown frontally, his head in three quarters view. He reaches for <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> parrot perched on her lap. At some point the Child's nudity was covered up; this overpaint was removed during a late 20th-century restoration. He is intended to represent both the host and Eucharist, common allusions in Early Netherlandish art and reflecting that the panel was intended for the celebration of mass.|$|E
5|$|The story's {{main part}} {{takes place in}} <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> normal high school, but in fact all {{took place in the}} school term {{previous}} to Little Busters!, and Riki and Rin are reliving it in an artificial world created by {{the other members of the}} Little Busters. They, and the other main characters, were involved in a bus accident during a field trip, and only the two of them will survive. Kyousuke and the others created the artificial world to make them strong enough to deal with what will happen when they awaken in the real world. This was caused by a ripple effect based on all of their desires to save Riki and Rin. The world loops, but though they forget what happens, Riki and Rin do grow stronger, and Kyousuke hopes that they will eventually be strong enough to leave the world. They do manage to survive and get away from the crash site before Riki collapses because he has narcolepsy. Riki vows to fight against his narcoleptic condition, which was the reason why he was only able to save Rin and merely get away from the explosion before collapsing.|$|E

5|$|The porters {{abandon the}} group in fear when mysterious tracks are found, while Tintin, Haddock and Tharkey go on and {{eventually}} reach the crash site. Tintin sets off with Snowy to trace Chang's steps, and finds a cave where Chang has carved his name on a rock. On leaving the cave, he encounters a snowstorm and glimpses <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> human silhouette. Tharkey believes that Tintin saw the Yeti and convinces him to abandon his friend and return with him to Nepal, since the area is too large to search. Tintin spots a scarf on a cliff face, concludes Chang is nearby, and continues with only the Captain. While attempting to scale a cliff face, Haddock slips and hangs out of reach, imperilling Tintin, who is tied to him. He tells Tintin to cut the rope to save himself, but Tintin refuses. Haddock tries to cut it himself, but drops his knife, alerting Tharkey, who has returned in time to rescue them. They try to camp for the night but lose their tent and must trek onwards, unable to sleep lest they freeze, arriving {{within sight of the}} Buddhist monastery of Khor-Biyong before being caught in an avalanche.|$|E
25|$|In {{another example}} of {{aggressive}} mimicry, males are lured toward <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sexually receptive female, only to be eaten. For example, fireflies of the genus Photuris emit the same light signals that females of the genus Photinus emit as a mating signal.|$|E
25|$|Most of the seen Southern Lands {{seem to be}} mountainous, rocky and barren, though <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> more {{tropical}} forested {{nation and}} a colder region have briefly been seen. The people of the Southern Lands are significantly different ethnically and culturally, with nations roughly analogous to real-world Asian cultures such as China and India, {{the most prominent of}} which was Azure City, which greatly resembled feudal Japan (though a few Chinese elements were present). Four separate areas in the South besides Azure city are briefly shown.|$|E

A traumatised child witness swears that the beast {{is controlled by}} <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> human master. Fronsac studies the patterns of the attacks and victims, {{trying to find a}} common thread and reveal the murderer. As the investigation proves to be unfruitful, the king's weapons master, Lord de Beauterne, arrives {{to put an end to}} the beast. However, instead of doing so, Beauterne kills an ordinary wolf and tells Fronsac to alter the corpse so it resembles the monster. Fronsac hesitantly does so, and the bogus wolf is sent back to Paris, where it is put on display, much to the pleasure of the king and the French aristocracy.|$|E
25|$|In one case, a {{boy with}} H5N1 {{experienced}} diarrhea followed rapidly by a coma without developing respiratory or flu-like symptoms. There have been studies of the levels of cytokines in humans infected by the H5N1 flu virus. Of particular concern is elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, a protein associated with tissue destruction at sites of infection and increased production of other cytokines. Flu virus-induced increases {{in the level of}} cytokines is also associated with flu symptoms, including fever, chills, vomiting and headache. Tissue damage associated with pathogenic flu virus infection can ultimately result in death. The inflammatory cascade triggered by H5N1 has been called a 'cytokine storm' by some, because of <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> positive feedback process of damage to the body resulting from immune system stimulation. H5N1 induces higher levels of cytokines than the more common flu virus types.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} Louis XIII Comes of Age {{represents the}} historical {{scene of the}} transferring of power from mother to son in abstract, or allegorical means. Marie has reigned as regent during her son's youth, and now she has handed the rudder of the ship to Louis, the new king of France. The ship represents the state, now in operation as Louis steers the vessel. Each of the rowers can be identified by the emblematic shields that hang {{on the side of}} the ship. The second rower's shield depicts a flaming altar with four sphinxes, a coiling serpent and an open eye that looks downwards. These characteristics are known to be that of Piety or Religion, both of which Maria would want her son to embody. What is also known as a parade boat, Rubens referencing Horace's boat, is adorned with a dragon on front and dolphins on the stern. Louis looks upwards to his mother for guidance on how to steer the ship of state. In the violent clouds are two Fames, one with a Roman buccina and the second with <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> trumpet. Louis guides, while the ship's actual movement is due to the four rowing figures, personifying Force, Religion, Justice, and Concord. The figure adjusting the sail is thought to be Prudence or Temperance. At the center in front of the mast stands France, with a flame in her right hand illustrating steadfastness and the globe of the realm, or the orb of government, in her left. Force, extending her oar and heaving to, is identified by the shield just beneath her showing a lion and column. She is paired with Marie by the color of their hair, and similarly Louis is paired with Religion, or the Order of the Holy Spirit.|$|E

500|$|Newburgh has a {{commercial}} strip {{north of the}} city, featuring the Mid-Valley Mall and another large shopping plaza built around a supermarket anchor. This development ends after [...] when 32 passes the Town of Newburgh's Cronomer Hill Park on the south, near a short drive to the summit observation tower. [...] more brings Route32 {{to the center of}} the hamlet of Cronomer Valley and an unusual junction with NY300. At <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> conventional four-way intersection regulated by a traffic light, both highways turn, and it is necessary to turn to the northeast to stay on NY32 headed north. Traffic that goes straight at this intersection flows onto Route300.|$|E
500|$|Another case {{is where}} males are lured towards <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> sexually {{receptive}} female. The model {{in this situation}} is the same species as the dupe. Beginning in the 1960s, James E. Lloyd's investigation of female fireflies of the genus Photuris revealed they emit the same light signals that females of the genus Photinus use as a mating signal. Further research showed male fireflies from several different genera are attracted to these [...] "femmes fatales", and are subsequently captured and eaten. Female signals are based on that received from the male, each female having a repertoire of signals matching the delay and duration of the female of the corresponding species. This mimicry may have evolved from non-mating signals that have become modified for predation.|$|E
500|$|Agent Leo Fitz, {{searching for}} answers {{concerning}} a mysterious Kree monolith that has apparently consumed his partner Jemma Simmons, acquires an ancient Hebrew scroll describing it as [...] "Death" [...] (...) [...] S.H.I.E.L.D. director Phil Coulson {{searches for the}} leader of the soldiers who have been taking new Inhumans, and discovers a woman who has worked for multiple government agencies around the world under different names. He and Agent Lance Hunter are able to confront her in <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> weak point in her security, but is actually a trap. Giving her name as Rosalind Price, she confronts Coulson about his organisation’s killing of new Inhumans before her group can get to them, which he denies, and the two realize that there is a third party involved.|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, Mulder and Scully {{visit the}} care home where Roland lives. When they gently {{ask him about}} the night of the murder, he tells them he had not seen {{anything}} out of the ordinary. He also inadvertently reveals his mathematical prowess by rapidly counting the star designs visible on Scully's blouse; however, his handwriting does not match the fourth sample taken from the whiteboard. The discussion ends when Roland experiences a violent vision and has <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> fit. Later that night, Roland has another vision in which he sees someone killing Keats. He appears at the lab and murders Keats by submerging his head in a tank of liquid nitrogen. Keats' frozen body is left to shatter as Roland begins typing at one of the computers.|$|E
500|$|Hamlisch and Alan and Marilyn Bergman wrote [...] "The Way We Were" [...] while Marty Paich handled its production.

Streisand sings, [...] "What's too painful to remember / We quickly choose to forget", where she longs for nostalgia, which Rolling Stones Stephen Holden described as an implication that [...] "resonate in the current social malaise".

500|$|The opening {{sequence}} of the episode was meant to replicate the same idea of season 2's premiere [...] "Man of Science, Man of Faith", where <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> flashback is instead set on a new part of the island. Director Jack Bender questioned what Jack's goal was when he pulled on the chain, but Lindelof {{told him not to}} worry, because [...] "Fox will sell it, and he did". Lindelof described when Jack attacks his father at the AA meeting as [...] "pot-committed... it basically means you put so much money on the bluff, you can't fold your cards". The scene with Kate in a dress was inspired by Raiders of the Lost Ark, where Belloq gives a dress for Marion Ravenwood to wear, and was intended to make [...] "tom-boyish" [...] Kate feel vulnerable. The title, inspired by Charles Dickens' eponymous novel, refers to the reveal of another [...] "city" [...] on the island with the place where the Others live, in addition to the castaways' beach camp. The episode has only three characters of the second season's main cast, Jack, Kate and Sawyer. Lindelof later described this limited scope as [...] "a mistake, when the audience is away from the show for that long, they want to see everybody", causing the following season openers to have scenes with most of the main characters.|$|E
500|$|Rotten Tomatoes reports an 82% {{approval}} rating, {{based on}} 11 reviews. The critical consensus reads, [...] ""Afterbirth" [...] is an enjoyable season finale that manages {{to deliver a}} few last minute scares as it ties up loose ends." [...] James Queally from The Star-Ledger commented about the season and its finale, [...] "After a wildly uneven first nine episodes... and two red-hot episodes {{leading up to the}} finale... "Afterbirth" [...] starts out flying high at the way too fast pace that has made American Horror Story an enjoyable ride these past two weeks. But somewhere in the final 30 minutes of this episode, [...] "Afterbirth" [...] turns into a wandering epilogue." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club stated, [...] "Part of the fun of those early episodes – even when I really didn't like them – was that you never quite had a good sense of what the hell kind of show you were watching. The finale sticks us into <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> pretty basic setup for season two." [...] Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Afterbirth" [...] "an exhilarating shocker." [...] Matt Fowler at IGN gave the episode a score eight out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. He stated, [...] ""Afterbirth" [...] was a very odd finale and I'm pretty sure that it was nothing like most of us thought it would be." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} starts {{off with a}} blue monitor screen with an eye showing the {{inscription}} [...] "Welcome". The video progresses inside a blue space ship-style room with Madonna lying prostrate in <b>what</b> <b>seems</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> scientific experiment. The imagery cast in {{this section of the}} video have drawn comparisons to hermeticism. The video progresses into a sequence of dreams, containing varied surrealistic, mystic, new age, Sufi and Egyptian imagery and symbolism. Such include a scene in which Madonna lies on a rotating sunflower, and images of a woman with long hair, an alchemist-type man holding a cube with Madonna's face on each side as well as rotating Sufi dancers. The dream sequence progresses with unusual clips, including Madonna in a pool with half-visible skulls. A scene in which Madonna, dressed in a light dressing gown, gives birth to doves, can also be seen; the image has been compared to the work of René Magritte and Kahlo's 1932 painting My Birth. Suddenly, she floats down a corridor in a white gown and appears in a black-and-white projection in a cinema-like room. As the music gets more dramatic, the dream grows intense, with images of skulls and scars appearing, and the singer can be seen wading through space. A scene in which Madonna's eyes are replaced with her mouth and her mouth with an eye precedes the ending, influenced by the work of Kahlo; the final shots show Madonna waking up and looking out.|$|E
