5|$|A Cape Coloured of Indian and Portuguese ancestry, D'Oliveira left South Africa {{primarily}} because the era's apartheid legislation seriously restricted his career prospects on racial grounds and barred {{him from the}} all-white Test team.

Manoeuvring by cricketing and political figures in both countries did little to bring the matter to a head. The MCC's priority was to maintain traditional links <b>with</b> <b>South</b> Africa and have the series go ahead without incident. South Africa's Prime Minister B.J. Vorster sought to appease international opinion by publicly indicating that D'Oliveira's inclusion would be acceptable, but secretly did all he could to prevent it.|$|E
