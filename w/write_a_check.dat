If the account is not planned to be replenished, then the fraud is colloquially known as paper hanging. If <b>writing</b> <b>a</b> <b>check</b> with insufficient funds is done with the expectation they will be covered by payday - in effect a payday loan - it is called playing the float.|$|R

50|$|It is {{noteworthy}} {{to mention that}} VMS really started to evolve around the time Michael Hammer and James Champy's Reengineering the Corporation became a bestseller. Large enterprises were {{looking for ways to}} compete in the global economy.
