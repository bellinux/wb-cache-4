Smoking can not only make Crohn's disease worse in people <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> but also increase the risk of recurrence after surgery. If a Crohn's disease patient who undergoes surgery does not quit smoking, the disease is likely to recur more aggressively.|$|E

Tilcox is able to return to the ice roads after being treated for his injuries. The expense of his treatment is highlighted on the show as a cause of concern for Tilcox. Despite his ordeals, Tilcox gains respect for the job and the people <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> as well as self-satisfaction for having completed the entire season — a rare feat for a rookie (as mentioned in the finale). He leaves with the respect and admiration of his fellow ice road veterans.|$|E

[...] The MVD breeding protocol recommends that parents {{should be at least}} 2.5 years old and heart clear, and their parents (i.e., the puppy's grandparents) should be heart clear until age 5.|$|E

500|$|... "Commander" [...] is an electro-house-R song, set in {{a common}} time {{signature}} of 125beats per minute. It was written by Kelly Rowland, Rico Love, David Guetta and Sandy Vee with deliberate grammar errors such as [...] "there's no other <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> like I do it" [...] and [...] "you won't find no lady who does it like I does it". The lyrics have themes around hair, fashion and competing with other women. Guetta also produced the synthesized dance beats, {{which is similar to}} his other production, [...] "Sexy Bitch". The end portions of the song were compared to some of the works by hip-hop producer Timbaland. Rowland explained that the hook of the song, [...] "Commander", should be associated with dance instead of the military. [...] "When I command you to dance ... I want you moving, you know? It felt good to have a song that I could express that in." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} Naga Hex, the Naga Hex v2 {{received}} mixed reviews, {{with the major}} criticism being its button arrangement. Amanda Yeo of the website Gizmodo {{said that if the}} reader liked the Naga Hex, the Naga Hex v2 is a definite upgrade. She noted that newer users might be thrown off by the button configuration. Marshall Honorof's biggest criticism of the mouse was that [...] "most people won't need one", though he continued to say that for those <b>who</b> <b>do,</b> <b>it</b> would work exactly as expected. He said that at first, the button arrangement threw him off. Michael Crider of Digital Trends said that once the user gets used to the button layout, the actions are [...] "quick and responsive." [...] Matthew Buzzi of PC Magazine also believed that the user would like it if they play MOBAs, but if not, another mouse might be a better option. He also asserted that the Naga Hex v2 is reliable and well made. Kane Fulton from Techradar listed the Naga Hex v2 as one of the ten best gaming mice.|$|E
500|$|A {{major theme}} {{in the book is}} the {{characterization}} of child abuse. The story follows Bruce Wayne as he learns about the different categories of child abuse, from the ignorant to the incapable and to those <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for pleasure. Batman, whose motivation is to prevent crimes like the murder of his parents, is contrasted against a social worker whose motivation is protecting children; Batman realizes that throughout his career he had been fighting criminals, not crime. Vachss asserts that [...] "child protection and crime prevention are the same thing"; he believes that child abuse is never just a random crime but is done with intent. While Vachss warns that those abused can become future abusers, he also states that [...] "abuse can push two similarly maltreated children in opposite directions. One incest victim becomes a promiscuous adult, another never engages in sex again. ... If you excuse a serial killer because he was tortured as a child, you disrespect the thousands of children who were treated worse and never imitated their oppressor." ...|$|E

500|$|Robinson {{was also}} derided by {{opposing}} teams. Some, notably the St. Louis Cardinals, threatened to strike if Robinson played, {{but also to}} spread the walkout across the entire National League. Existence of the plot was leaked by the Cardinals' team physician, Robert Hyland, to a friend, the New York Herald Tribunes Rutherford [...] "Rud" [...] Rennie. The reporter, concerned about protecting Hyland's anonymity and job, in turn leaked it to his Tribune colleague and editor, Stanley Woodward, whose own subsequent reporting with other sources protected Hyland. The Woodward article made national headlines. After the threat was exposed, National League President Ford Frick and Baseball Commissioner Happy Chandler {{let it be known}} that any striking players would be suspended. [...] "You will find that the friends that you think you have in the press box will not support you, that you will be outcasts," [...] threatened Chandler. [...] "I do not care if half the league strikes. Those <b>who</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> will encounter quick retribution. All will be suspended and I don't care if it wrecks the National League for five years. This is the United States of America and one citizen has as much right to play as another." [...] Woodward's article received the E. P. Dutton Award in 1947 for Best Sports Reporting. New York Times columnist Red Smith turned to the Cardinals' 1947 racial strike in 1977, as a spate of commemorative articles appeared on the 30th anniversary of Robinson's signing with the Dodgers. Smith remembered his old Herald Tribune colleagues' part in exposing the players' strike conspiracy. It would have succeeded, wrote Smith, [...] "…if Rud Rennie and Stanley Woodward hadn't exposed their intentions in the New York Herald Tribune." ...|$|E
