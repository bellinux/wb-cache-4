5|$|Lagenidium giganteum is a <b>water-borne</b> mould that parasitizes the {{larval stage}} of mosquitoes. When applied to water, the motile spores avoid {{unsuitable}} host species and search out suitable mosquito larval hosts. This alga has {{the advantages of}} a dormant phase, resistant to desiccation, with slow-release characteristics over several years. Unfortunately, it is susceptible to many chemicals used in mosquito abatement programmes.|$|E
5|$|Following Cyprien, the Government of Madagascar did not request {{international}} assistance in post-storm recovery. By January10, a cargo plane carrying 65million MGF (2002 MGF; US$10,062) worth of relief supplies was deployed to the affected regions. The supplies, consisting of medical supplies, tents, and one tonne of rice, {{were given to}} local authorities to be distributed to the affected population. Sanitary items were also distributed {{by the government to}} avoid an outbreak of <b>water-borne</b> diseases such as diarrhea and cholera.|$|E
5|$|In {{ecosystems}} such as mangrove swamps, trees {{play a role}} {{in developing}} the habitat, since the roots of the mangrove trees reduce the speed of flow of tidal currents and trap <b>water-borne</b> sediment, reducing the water depth and creating suitable conditions for further mangrove colonisation. Thus mangrove swamps tend to extend seawards in suitable locations. Mangrove swamps also provide an effective buffer against the more damaging effects of cyclones and tsunamis.|$|E
5|$|High water {{remained}} in Salcha through the 31st, though {{the crest of}} the flooding had passed. Water continued to cover roads in and around Salcha, and <b>water-borne</b> debris accumulated under several local bridges, causing impromptu dams. By August 1, the Salcha River had begun to recede to a noticeable extent. Though some roads remained underwater and falling trees knocked out power to areas of the town, residents began to pump out basements and begin recovery efforts. By early afternoon on the first, the Old Richardson Highway had been cleared of water and the National Weather Service canceled its flood warning for the Salcha area.|$|E
5|$|In late 1203, John {{attempted}} to relieve Château Gaillard, which although besieged by Philip was guarding the eastern flank of Normandy. John attempted a synchronised operation involving land-based and <b>water-borne</b> forces, considered by most historians today {{to have been}} imaginative in conception, but overly complex for forces of the period to have carried out successfully. John's relief operation was blocked by Philip's forces, and John turned back to Brittany {{in an attempt to}} draw Philip away from eastern Normandy. John successfully devastated much of Brittany, but did not deflect Philip's main thrust into the east of Normandy. Opinions vary amongst historians as to the military skill shown by John during this campaign, with most recent historians arguing that his performance was passable, although not impressive.|$|E
5|$|The main plant foods {{gathered}} were walnuts, saguaro fruits, juniper berries, acorns, sunflower seeds, manzanita {{berries and}} apples, hackberries, the bulbs of the Quamash, and the greens of the Lamb's quarters, Scrophularia, and Lupinus plants. Agave {{was the most}} crucial harvest, {{as it was the}} only plant food available from late fall through early spring. The hearts of the plant were roasted in stone-lined pits, and could be stored for later use. Primary animals hunted were deer, rabbit, jackrabbit, quail, and woodrat. Fish and <b>water-borne</b> birds were eschewed by most Yavapai groups. Some groups of Tolkepaya began eating fish after contact with their Quechan neighbors.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{population}} density of Varanasi and {{the increasing number of}} tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for the pollution and pressures on infrastructure in the city, mainly the sewage, sanitation, and drainage components. Pollution of the Ganges is a particular source of worry because of the religious significance of the river, the dependence of people on it as a source of drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself. The sewage problem is exacerbated by the role of the Ganges in bathing and in river traffic, which is very difficult to control. Because of the sewage, people using local untreated water have higher risk of contracting a range of <b>water-borne</b> stomach diseases.|$|E
5|$|Local {{residents}} were evicted, including 1,200 {{people who lived}} in shacks around the barracks. Around 300 Jewish residents of Oświęcim were brought in to lay foundations. From 1940 to 1941, 17,000 Polish and Jewish residents of the western districts of Oświęcim were expelled from places adjacent to the camp. The Germans also ordered expulsions of Poles from the villages of Broszkowice, Babice, Brzezinka, Rajsko, Pławy, Harmęże, Bór, and Budy to the General Government. German citizens were offered tax concessions and other benefits if they would relocate to the area. By October 1943, more than 6,000 Reich Germans had arrived. The Nazis planned to build a model modern residential area for incoming Germans, including schools, playing fields, and other amenities. Some of the plans went forward, including the construction of several hundred apartments, but many were never fully implemented. Basic amenities such as water and sewage disposal were inadequate, and <b>water-borne</b> illnesses were commonplace.|$|E
5|$|On December18, 1998, the United Nations {{launched}} a large-scale rehabilitation effort in Cuba. Roughly $14million {{was spent on}} housing and infrastructure reconstruction and repair; {{this portion of the}} project consisted of reconstruction of homes, schools, businesses, hospitals, irrigation and the water system. Another $1.1million was used to inform and protect residents against post-storm diseases. The largest part of the effort involved jump-starting agriculture and fisheries. Roughly $50.4million was provided to reconstruct fishing vessels, purchase new tools and gear. By mid-February 1999, the Governments of Italy, Germany, Canada and the European Union provided $1million, $714,000, $50,000, and $510,200 in funds respectively. The Government of Israel also supplied agricultural tools. The Government of Norway provided $29,100 in <b>water-borne</b> disease prevention funds. Through various agencies, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs provided Cuba with roughly $86million in disaster funding.|$|E
5|$|On October20, the {{government}} of Cuba issued {{an appeal to the}} international community for assistance. The Red Cross provided $1.6million to the country, and various departments of the United Nations provided $80,000. The government of Japan sent about $104,000 worth of medical equipment, and Italy sent about $526,000 worth of medical supplies. The Canadian Red Cross donated a water purification unit, and the Spanish Red Cross sent blankets and cots. The German Red Cross also sent mattresses and blankets. The American Red Cross sent 9.5tons of food. Several other countries sent assistance, including the European Commission which sent $750,000 worth of supplies. There were early difficulties in transporting the relief supplies due to fuel shortages. Due to storm damage, 66,881people resided in shelters until their houses were rebuilt, or until they moved elsewhere. By March 1997, most people had returned to their homes, although some did so without a roof. There was a threat for <b>water-borne</b> diseases due to stagnant waters, although no such outbreaks occurred. The storm decreased the supply of the banana crop in 1997, coupled with a drought.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods of}} {{insertion}} were considered, {{both for the}} paras and the special forces personnel, including an overland approach using four-wheel drive vehicles, and a <b>water-borne</b> insertion using the same method by which the SAS observation teams had arrived at their position. The planning group decided that the overland approach would not allow troops to enter the village undetected, {{largely due to the}} West Side Boys' roadblocks on the road into the village, and that insertion from Rokel Creek was not feasible for large numbers of troops due to the sandbanks and powerful currents in the river. Thus, it was decided that the insertions would be made from three Royal Air Force Chinook helicopters from No. 7 Squadron, which had been in Sierra Leone since the beginning of Operation Palliser.|$|E
5|$|Betjeman {{explores the}} ruins of St Benet's Abbey before seeing its modern {{equivalent}} at a convent of Anglican nuns at the Community of All Hallows, Ditchingham. Betjeman then takes the North Norfolk Railway to Walsingham to see the Anglican pilgrims going to the church of Our Lady of Walsingham. After {{a look at the}} Queen's church in Sandringham and the unusual Victorian church at Booton, choir practices are seen in progress at Martham and Wymondham Abbey. Exulting the work of Sir Ninian Comper at Lound, Suffolk, Betjeman recalls that he looked like Colonel Sanders. As Easter Day approaches, Betjeman reflects on the furthest reaches of the diocese - <b>water-borne</b> ministries, a parish church in Flordon that no one attends, as well as the fate of those churches declared redundant; conversion into hospitals, an artists' studio, a shoe store and dereliction. Easter Day breaks in Lowestoft, and the viewer sees traditionally dressed ladies from the Almshouses in Castle Rising. The film concludes back in Norwich as parishioners of St Peter Mancroft, and parishioners from churches all around the county summoned by bells, walk to worship.|$|E
5|$|Following the cyclone's passage, the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society began {{dispatching}} relief teams, food, {{and other}} supplies to impacted areas. The Bangladesh Army and non-governmental organizations participated in both air- and <b>water-borne</b> relief operations, though inclement weather initially forced the suspension of several planned helicopter flights. Both the Bangladesh Navy and Indian Navy convened in the northern littoral of the Bay of Bengal {{to search for the}} thousands of fishermen and islanders that went missing during the tropical cyclone's landfall. Due to the wide scope of the disaster, the Bangladeshi government appealed for international aid, particularly from Japan and Canada as those countries had played large roles in the relief efforts of past Bangladeshi disasters. The Government of the Netherlands donated US$370,000for use in the relief efforts following the storm. Lord Glenarthur, then British Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, toured effected areas in Bangladesh for three days before announcing a ₤200,000grant (US$370,000) to voluntary relief agencies assisting in cyclone relief operations. Then-Bangladeshi President Hussain Muhammad Ershad also visited the worst impacted districts, including Khulna and Bagerhat. Following these visits, Ershad's administration established a national disaster committee composed of relief specialists to coordinate relief and rehabilitation efforts.|$|E
5|$|The drop in air {{delivery}} to Korea caused Major General Earle E. Partridge, commanding the Far East Air Forces, to complain on August 10 that the Army was not fully using the airlift's 200 tonne daily capacity. That day, Eighth Army ordered curtailment of delivery by the Red Ball Express and {{increased use of}} the airlift to its maximum capacity. The reason given for this action was a sudden apprehension that the port of Pusan could not process the flow of <b>water-borne</b> supplies in a timely manner. The next day, upon Partridge's suggestion, two 2½-ton trucks were airlifted in a C-119 from Tachikawa Air Base in Japan to Taegu. The Air Force planned to airlift two trucks daily in this manner. As a result, on August 12, Eighth Army ordered the Red Ball Express be discontinued August 15 except on Tuesday and Friday of each week when it would carry cargo that was considered too difficult for the planes to handle. Under this arrangement airlift tonnage greatly increased. On August 16, transport planes carried 324tonnes of cargo and 595 passengers; on August 19, 160tonnes of cargo and 381 passengers; on 28 August, 398tonnes of cargo and 343 passengers; and, on August 29, 326tonnes of cargo and 347 passengers.|$|E
5|$|Chennai {{was officially}} {{declared}} a disaster {{area on the}} evening of 2 December. At the MIOT Hospital, 14 patients died after power and oxygen supplies failed. With a letup in rainfall, floodwaters gradually began to recede in Chennai on 4 December, though 40 percent of the city's districts remained submerged and safe food and drinking water remained in short supply. Though relief efforts were well underway across most of the area by 3 December, the lack of any coordinated relief response in North Chennai forced thousands of its residents to evacuate on their own. As intermittent rains returned, thousands of displaced residents from Chennai, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur districts attempted to flee the stricken region by bus or train and travel to their family homes. Chennai International Airport was partly reopened for cargo flights on 5 December, with passenger flights scheduled to resume from the following morning. By 6 December, rescue efforts had largely concluded and relief efforts intensified, with the Chennai Corporation beginning to disburse relief packages. Mobile, banking and power services were gradually restored; fuel and food supplies were reaching their destinations, the airport had fully reopened and rail services slowly resumed. Many city neighbourhoods, however, remained flooded with some lacking basic necessities due to the uncoordinated distribution of relief materials. With the city slowly beginning to recover, state and national health officials remained watchful against disease outbreaks, warning that conditions were right for epidemics of <b>water-borne</b> illnesses to occur. Chennai Corporation officials reported at least 57,000 homes in the city had suffered structural damage, mostly those of working class pincodes. State housing boards said they would conduct safety inspections of both public and residential buildings. After being closed for the past month, schools and colleges across the affected districts began to reopen from 14 December. Relief operations were largely wound up by 19 December.|$|E
5|$|<b>Water-borne</b> {{trade has}} been practiced {{since at least}} the dawn of civilization, when Sumeria was {{connected}} to Harappan India. Around 2000 BC, the Minoans of Crete established the earliest thalassocracy, a maritime empire heavily dependent upon its trade and naval power. The city-states of the Phoenicians and Greeks then replaced them in the centuries after 1200 BC, ultimately establishing far-flung colonial empires which spread from the Sea of Azov to the Atlantic coast of Morocco. Under the Romans, commerce continued to thrive. In the first centuries BC, steppe nomads' interruption of India's access to Siberian gold caused them to open up maritime routes to Malaysia and Indonesia, exposing them first to Hindu and then Muslim traders. With the collapse of the Roman Empire, European trade dwindled but it continued to flourish elsewhere. The Tamil Chola dynasty thrived on trade between Tang China, the Javanese Srivijaya Empire, and the Abbasid Caliphate in the west. Following further conquests, Arabians came to dominate maritime trade in the Indian Ocean, spreading Islam along the East African coast and, eventually, Southeast Asia. A major effect of the Age of Discovery was the unification of the world's regional trade networks into a single world market, largely run by and for the European monarchs and the merchants of Amsterdam, London, and other Atlantic ports. From the 16th to the 19th centuries, about 13 million people were shipped across the Atlantic to be sold as slaves in the Americas. The Hales Trophy was an award for the fastest commercial crossing of the Atlantic and was won by the SS United States in 1952 for a crossing that took three days, ten hours, and forty minutes.|$|E
25|$|Several {{food and}} <b>water-borne</b> {{diseases}} {{are likely to}} be transmitted among susceptible populations, although climate will seldom be the only factor.|$|E
25|$|As {{recently}} as the late 19th century sewerage systems {{in some parts of}} the rapidly industrializing United Kingdom were so inadequate that <b>water-borne</b> diseases such as cholera and typhoid remained a risk.|$|E
25|$|The {{incidence}} of <b>water-borne</b> and enteric diseases—such as gastrointestinal disease, cholera, dysentery, hepatitis A and typhoid—among {{people who use}} the river's waters for bathing, washing dishes and brushing teeth is high, at an estimated 66% per year.|$|E
25|$|The Elan dam {{scheme was}} {{developed}} in the 19th century following rapid growth of the population of Birmingham in England due to the Industrial Revolution. The city's expansion resulted in regular outbreaks of <b>water-borne</b> diseases and major epidemics such as typhoid, cholera and dysentery {{because of the lack of}} clean water.|$|E
25|$|Many Bohol {{residents}} were left without adequate {{safe drinking water}} and sanitary facilities after the quake. Consequently, serious public health issues arose such as cases of diarrhea and <b>water-borne</b> diseases. Worst affected were the municipalities closest to the epicenter, such as Sagbayan, San Isidro, Calape, Tubigon, Clarin and Catigbian.|$|E
25|$|Specifically, the Act {{established}} the United States Maritime Commission and required a United States Merchant Marine {{that consisted of}} U.S.-built, U.S.-flagged, U.S.-crewed, and U.S.-owned vessels capable of carrying all domestic and {{a substantial portion of}} foreign <b>water-borne</b> commerce which could serve as a naval auxiliary in time of war or national emergency.|$|E
25|$|Chichen Itza {{was a major}} {{economic}} power in the northern Maya lowlands during its apogee. Participating in the <b>water-borne</b> circum-peninsular trade route through its port site of Isla Cerritos on the north coast, Chichen Itza was able to obtain locally unavailable resources from distant areas such as obsidian from central Mexico and gold from southern Central America.|$|E
25|$|Cryptosporidiosis {{is found}} worldwide. It causes 50.8% of <b>water-borne</b> {{diseases}} that {{are attributed to}} parasites. In developing countries, 8–19% of diarrheal diseases {{can be attributed to}} Cryptosporidium. Ten percent of the population in developing countries excretes oocysts. In developed countries, the number is lower at 1–3%. The age group most affected are children from 1 to 9 years old.|$|E
25|$|The related Unit 8604 was {{operated}} by the Japanese Southern China Area Army and stationed at Guangzhou (Canton). This installation conducted human experimentation in food and water deprivation as well as <b>water-borne</b> typhus. According to postwar testimony, this facility served as the main rat breeding farm for the medical units {{to provide them with}} bubonic plague vectors for experiments.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{resources}} of Gaza include arable land—about {{a third of}} the strip is irrigated. Recently, natural gas was discovered. Environmental problems include desertification; salination of fresh water; <b>water-borne</b> disease; soil degradation; lack of adequate sewage treatment; and depletion and contamination of underground water resources. The Gaza Strip is largely dependent on water from Wadi Gaza, which also supplies Israel.|$|E
25|$|The Americans, however, {{wanted to}} shift from <b>water-borne</b> trade to a {{land-based}} trade system. Their idea for establishing this depended on something they were masters at: building railways. The American colonial government thought a railway could help boost Nueva Ecija's economic growth, {{in the same way}} that the US railway system helped unite and develop the economy of the North American continent.|$|E
25|$|Fresh water {{remains a}} concern of Kiribati – {{during the dry season}} (Aumaiaki), water has been drilled for instead of using rain water tanks. In recent years, there has been a longer than usual Aumaikai season {{resulting}} in additional water having to be drilled from beneath the water table. This has introduced <b>water-borne</b> illnesses, compounding the health problems within Kiribati.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{these systems}} {{discharged}} sewage directly to surface waters without treatment. Later, cities attempted {{to treat the}} sewage before discharge {{in order to prevent}} water pollution and waterborne diseases. During the half-century around 1900, these public health interventions succeeded in drastically reducing the incidence of <b>water-borne</b> diseases among the urban population, and were an important cause in the increases of life expectancy experienced at the time.|$|E
25|$|Toyota Australia ceased {{manufacturing}} the XV10 at Port Melbourne in December 1994, with inventory stockpiles {{built up}} to last {{into the new}} year. Toyota switched Camry production to its new Altona, Victoria factory two weeks later in January 1995, with the official launch of the assembly line commissioned by Prime Minister Keating on 31 March. There was little difference between the Port Melbourne and Altona vehicles, except for a new <b>water-borne,</b> environmentally friendly paint process.|$|E
25|$|The first {{piped water}} systems were {{completed}} {{during the colonial}} period in the 1930s. <b>Water-borne</b> sewerage was introduced after 1937. The construction of new facilities increased from 1950 to 1965 under the framework of large national development programs. Later, the existing systems were only partly maintained and no new facilities were constructed until 1990. According to a UN-Water document, by 1990 the urban water infrastructure served less than 10 percent of the population in large towns.|$|E
25|$|Cholera is a <b>water-borne</b> disease, {{primarily}} {{spread by}} {{the consumption of}} water or food contaminated by the feces of an infected person. The outbreak was triggered by heavy rainfall and flooding in Sierra Leone and Guinea, combined with poor hygiene practices, unsafe water sources, and ineffective waste management. Crowded living conditions, poor sanitation and inadequate access to safe water {{are responsible for the}} higher rates of the outbreak in the Western Area including Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone.|$|E
25|$|Increased climate variability, that is {{associated}} with global warming, has brought with it periods of heavy rainfall and high tides which in turn results in stagnant water which can stay in the area for up to 4 weeks due to insufficient drainage and improper solid waste disposal. People are often stranded inside their homes and are exposed to <b>water-borne</b> diseases such as dengue and leptospirosis. Better early warning systems are needed to manage the risk associated with increased rainfall.|$|E
25|$|Swimmer’s itch or cercarial dermatitis, is a {{short-term}} immune reaction {{occurring in the}} skin of humans that have been infected by <b>water-borne</b> schistosomatidae. Symptoms, which include itchy, raised papules, commonly occur within hours of infection and do not generally last more than a week. It is common in freshwater, brackish and marine habitats worldwide. Incidence {{may be on the}} rise, although this may also be attributed to better monitoring. Nevertheless, the condition has been regarded as emerging infectious disease.|$|E
25|$|When {{reporting}} air-borne {{rather than}} <b>water-borne</b> densities, {{a slightly different}} convention is used since air is approximately 1000 times less dense than water. In water, 1µg/m3 is roughly equivalent to parts-per-trillion whereas in air, it is roughly equivalent to parts-per-billion. Note also, {{that in the case}} of air, this convention is much less accurate. Whereas one liter of water is almost exactly 1kg, one cubic meter of air is often taken as 1.143kg—much less accurate, but still close enough for many practical uses.|$|E
