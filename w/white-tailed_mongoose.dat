5000|$|The Selous’s {{mongoose}} has a {{total length}} of 63-90 cm and a tail length of 28-43 cm. It weighs about 1.4-2.0 kg. [...] The {{body of the}} mongoose ranges from pale speckled grey to tawny grey with a pale underside, while the legs are brown or black. [...] The tail of the mongoose is white at the tip, making it identifiable from the <b>white-tailed</b> <b>mongoose,</b> which has a tail that is ¾ white. The Selous’s mongoose is also smaller and more slender than the <b>white-tailed</b> <b>mongoose.</b> The mongoose has four digits on each limb and long, slightly curved claws {{that are associated with}} digging. [...] The main difference between the sexes is that the female Selous’s mongoose has three pairs of nipples on her underside, while the male does not.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-tailed</b> <b>mongoose</b> {{lives in}} most of Africa south of the Sahara, and the {{southern}} portion of the Arabian Peninsula.

50|$|Meller’s {{mongoose}} is {{a medium}} to large-size mongoose {{with a light}} to dark brown body and a long tail. It measures about 80 cm in length overall and weighs 2-3 kg. The tail is slightly {{less than half the}} overall length. The tail is variable in colour and may be black, brown or white, although dark brown to black is the most usual. At close quarters the upper parts of Meller’s mongoose are coarsely grizzled. The lower parts of the limbs are darker than the upper parts of the body. The under parts are generally lighter in colour than the upper parts. Meller’s mongoose may be confused with the <b>white-tailed</b> <b>mongoose,</b> however it is smaller and blacker overall than this species. It may also be confused with Selous’s and bushy-tailed mongooses.|$|E

50|$|A {{major threat}} to this species is habitat loss and disturbance. Human {{activity}} such as tourists walking through protected areas, pollution, unsustainable harvesting and urbanisation can destroy nesting sites. Plover populations can also be affected by rural human activity, for example fishermen walking through protected plover breeding sites, bringing large amounts of dogs with them- a known predator of plover eggs. Natural predators are also a problem, {{as many of these}} predators appear to thrive unnaturally well in the presence of plover breeding grounds, such as the brown-necked raven (Corvus ruficollis) in Maio, Cape Verde, the <b>White-tailed</b> <b>Mongoose</b> (Ichneumia albicauda) in Saudi Arabia, and the Grey Monitors (Varanus griseus) in Al Wathba Wetland Reserve. It is thought that the high amount of prey available to these predators attracts them into the breeding grounds- an effect named the ‘honey pot’, Global warming and climate change also plays a role in the decline of areas available for plovers to breed and reside in. It is known that the Kentish plover prefers to build its nests on low-elevated land close to water, and a study untaken in Saudi Arabia discovered that 11% of nests in the study site were in fact below sea level, therefore rising sea levels are predicted to have disastrous consequences for these low-sitting nests,.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-tailed</b> <b>mongoose</b> attains {{a weight}} range of 1.8 to 5.2 kg, {{with an average}} of {{approximately}} 3.38 kg, has a head-and-body length of 53 to 71 cm and a tail length of 40 to 47 cm. On average it appears to be the longest and heaviest extant species of mongoose, although its linear and body mass parameters broadly overlap with other larger mongoose species, in particular the marsh mongoose seems to most closely rival (and possibly match) in range of body masses reported if not average weight. Its legs are relatively long for a mongoose. The head is very long and narrow and tapers to a point. Its large, rounded ears are set low {{on the sides of the}} head. It has a yellow to tan coloration on its body, with long black guard hairs, giving it an overall grizzled grey appearance. The legs and arms are black from the elbow/knee down. The base of the large, bushy tail is brownish yellow, and is white on the latter half. The tail may make up to 40% of the body length and tapers to a point. They lack hair on their upper lip and their hands from the palms to the wrists. Females have four teats.|$|E
5000|$|In South Africa, the commonest foods were (in {{descending}} order of preference): Cape hyrax, Smith's red rock hare (Pronolagus rupertris), meerkat, mountain reedbuck (Redunca fulvorufula), goats and sheep, scrub hare (Lepus saxatilis), Cape francolin (Francolinus capensis), helmeted guineafowl(Numida meleagris), yellow mongoose (Cynictis penicillata) and Angulate tortoise (Chersina angulata). In “poor food areas” of the Matobo Hills, three nests included 53.6% hyrax, 10.7% cane-rats, 7.1% monkeys, 7.1% mongoose and 3.6% antelope. [...] From 1997 to 2005 {{in the same}} area, non-hyrax prey (each representing less than 10 out of 1550 prey items at nests) included <b>white-tailed</b> <b>mongoose</b> (Ichneumia albicauda), steenbok (Raphicerus campestris), domestic goat, vervet monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus), Jameson's red rock hare (Pronolagus randensis), helmeted guineafowl, Swainson's francolin (Pternistis swainsonii), Natal francolin (Pternistis natalensis), southern red-billed hornbill (Tockus rufirostris), rock pigeon (Columba livia), white-necked raven (Corvus albicollis), leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis) and giant plated lizard (Gerrhosaurus validus). In the Walter Sisulu National Botanical Garden of South Africa, the primary prey found around nests after a perceptible hyrax decline has become helmeted guineafowl and francolins, followed by cane rats, rabbits and dikdiks (Rhynchotragus ssp.). Young baboons may also be hunted, even the large-bodied chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) which have issued a predator alarm call {{in response to the}} presence of Verreaux's eagles. Carrion either fairly frequent or none at all. [...] A study of the taking of domestic lambs in the Karoo found only two cases of lambs being eaten by Verreaux's eagle and these were already dead when carried off. This contrasts with the golden eagle, which in some areas may eat many dead lambs and occasionally hunt lives ones. Although any prey weighing over 4.5 kg is rarely taken, some ungulates hunted by Verreaux's eagles can be considerably larger. Klipspringer (Oreotragus oreotragus) lambs brought to the nest have weighed up to 12 kg. A Verreaux's eagle was observed to hunt and kill a mountain reedbuck lamb estimated to weigh 15 kg.|$|E
50|$|Carnivores are {{exceptionally}} important prey for martial eagles. Among {{these many}} mongoose {{tend to be}} well represented in their diet. Most mongoose native to savanna tend to be highly social burrowers. Most {{of these types of}} mongoose are also relatively small (probably the second smallest important martial eagle food source after korhaans) and can effectively escape quickly to the safety of their underground home, so the lighter, more nimble male martial eagle is more likely to habitually pursue them. In southern Africa, the 0.72 kg meerkat (Suricata suricatta) comprises up to at least 9.6% of prey remains (as in the Cape Province) and the 0.75 kg Cape grey mongoose (Galerella pulverulenta) comprising an average of 7.2% of prey remains in the Cape area. The largest of the social savanna-dwelling mongoose is the banded mongoose at 2.12 kg. Despite often being successful in capturing banded mongoose, in one case when a (presumably inexperienced) immature martial eagle took one to a tree, the dominant male banded mongoose of the group scaled the tree and pulled away from the eagle the still-living mongoose prey to safety. The martial eagle is a known predator of the full size range of mongoose species, from the smallest species, the 0.27 kg common dwarf mongoose (Helogale parvula), to the largest, the 3.38 kg <b>white-tailed</b> <b>mongoose</b> (Ichneumia albicauda). Other moderate-sized carnivores known to fall prey to martial eagles include 0.83 kg striped polecat (Ictonyx striatus) and a few species of genet, which are about twice as heavy on average as the polecat. The martial eagle, however, can be a surprisingly effective predator of carnivorans close to their own size or larger. In the Cape Province, 72 bat-eared foxes (Otocyon megalotis), which average about 4.1 kg, were found in the prey remains, 85% of which were adults. Other foxes have also been hunted, as well as both black-backed (Canis mesomelas) and golden jackals (Canis aureus). Some of the black-backed jackals that martial eagles have captured and flown off with have included “half-grown” individuals and a rare adult, averaging some 8.9 kg, may also be killed but is usually grounded prey. Despite being marginally the smallest of the 3 jackals, the black-backed is the most aggressive and predatory species, so are probably taken only in surprise blitzes. Adult domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) of up to a modest size may occasionally be killed by martial eagles. Martial eagles are also known to opportunistically grab pups of African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) as they emerge from their dens. A similarly impressive range of felids have been included in their prey spectrum. Adults of both domestic cats and their ancestors, the 4.65 kg African wildcat (Felis silvestris lybica), are known to fall prey to this species. Arguably their most impressive mammalian carnivore prey though are adults of much larger cat species such as the 10.1 kg serval (Leptailurus serval) and even the 12.7 kg caracal (Caracal caracal). Apparent predatory attacks are even attempted on big cat cubs as they are considered potential predators of lion and leopard (Panthera pardus) cubs and confirmed predators of cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus) cubs. Evidence shows, however, they rapidly abandon hunting attempts if the formidable mother lion or leopard are present. Successful predatory attacks on other relatively large carnivores have included adults of the 12.4 kg African civet (Civettictis civetta) and the 8.16 kg aardwolf (Proteles cristata).While large accipitrids from around the world are credited with attacks on (almost always young) ungulates, perhaps no other species is as accomplished in this regard as this martial eagle. Over 30 species of ungulate have been identified as prey for this species, more species than are attributed to the perhaps more powerful crowned eagles and all the world’s golden eagles, although in all 3 seldom more than 30% of the diet are comprised by ungulates in a given region. In Kruger National Park, the martial eagle is mentioned as the only bird considered as a major predator of ungulate species. A majority of the ungulate diet of martial eagles are comprised by small antelope species or the young of larger antelopes. Locally favored prey are the dik-diks, one of the smallest kind of antelope, and every known species may be vulnerable to this eagle. In Tsavo East National Park, Kirk's dik-dik (Madoqua kirkii) were the second most numerous prey species and it was estimated that at least 86 dik-diks are taken in the park {{over the course of the}} year by two pairs of martial eagles. At an average of 5 kg, these can provide a very fulfilling meal for an eagle family. Adults of other smaller antelope such as 4.95 kg suni (Neotragus moschatus) and 4.93 kg blue duikers (Philantomba monticola) are probably also taken with relative ease. In general, the young of other antelope are usually attacked, including newborns. Occasional ambush attacks or successful predations are reported on adults of much larger species despite young ones being rather more vulnerable, including 12.1 kg klipspringers (Oreotragus oreotragus), 11.1 kg steenboks (Raphicerus campestris), both species of grysbok (7.6 to 10.6 kg on average), 14.6 kg oribis (Ourebia ourebi) and perhaps up to half a dozen larger duikers, potentially weighing from 7.7 to 25 kg. One duiker dispatched via strangulation weighed an estimated 37 kg, the largest known raptorial kill for any species on the African continent. Among extant birds of prey, only wedge-tailed eagles, reportedly capable of killing sheep and female red kangaroos (Macropus rufus) weighing up to 50 kg, and golden eagles, credited with taking adult female deer of several species with weights estimated at 50 to 70 kg and capable of apparently dispatching domestic calves weighing up to 114 kg, have larger kills attributed to them. Calves, including neonatal young, of the following antelope may also be included in their prey spectrum: impala (Aepyceros melampus), hartebeest (Alcelaphus buselaphus), bontebok (Damaliscus pygargus), common tsessebe (Damaliscus lunatus), springbok (Antidorcas marsupialis), Eudorcas gazelles, gerenuk (Litocranius walleri), bushbuck (Tragelaphus sylvaticus), grey rhebok (Pelea capreolus), kob (Kobus kob) and mountain reedbuck (Redunca arundinum). These species can vary in weight from 2.6 kg (i.e. gazelles) to 11 kg (i.e. tsessebe) in newborns. For the newborn impala, weighing already 5.55 kg, the martial eagle is the only bird considered to be a significant predator. Additionally, piglets of warthogs (Phacochoerus africanus) (of which only the martial eagle among accipitrids is similarly mentioned as a significant predator) and bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus) are taken.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The Farasan {{archipelago}} {{is located}} in the southern Red Sea, off the south-western coast of Saudi Arabia. Around the beginning of the 1990 s, these islands were designated as a marine and terrestrial reserve, mainly {{for the protection of the}} Farasan gazelle, which is the only wild ungulate present on the archipelago. As far as is presently known, other mammals reported from the islands are 2 or 3 species of bat, the Eastern spiny mouse, possibly 1 rat, and the <b>white-tailed</b> <b>mongoose.</b> To date there is no evidence for the occurrence of house mice. Furthermore, the occurrence of the Arabian sacred baboon has been reported from Farasan Kebir. The sea surrounding the archipelago is still home to dugongs and several species of cetaceans. All the non-volant mammalian species occurring at present on the Farasan islands appear to be essentially related to human introduction. The aim of the present work is to outline the occurrence and the distribution of the mammals of the Farasan islands in order to offer a starting point for future studies...|$|E
