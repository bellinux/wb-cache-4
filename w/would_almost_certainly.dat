5|$|George Calvert {{went up to}} Trinity College at Oxford University, matriculating in 1593/94, {{where he}} studied foreign {{languages}} and received a bachelor's degree in 1597. As the oath of allegiance was compulsory {{after the age of}} sixteen, he <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> have pledged conformity while at Oxford. The same pattern of conformity, whether pretended or sincere, continued through Calvert's early life. After Oxford, he moved in 1598 to London, where he studied municipal law at Lincoln's Inn for three years.|$|E
5|$|On May 1, 2009, Paul {{said that}} if Bunning, whose {{fundraising}} in 2009 matched his poor numbers in opinion polling for the 2010 election, declined to seek a third term, he <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> run in the Republican Party primary to succeed him, and formed an exploratory committee soon after, while still promising {{to stay out of}} the race if Bunning ultimately decided to run for reelection. Paul made this announcement on MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show, though a Kentucky news site first broke the news.|$|E
5|$|Only three Milky Way naked-eye {{supernova}} {{events have}} been observed during the last thousand years, though many have been seen in other galaxies using telescopes. The most recent directly observed supernova in the Milky Way was Kepler's Supernova in 1604, but the remnants of two more recent supernovae have also been found. Statistical observations of supernovae in other galaxies suggest they occur on average about three times every century in the Milky Way, and that any galactic supernova <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> be observable with modern astronomical telescopes.|$|E

5000|$|Eileen Chang (1920-1995), one of {{the most}} {{influential}} modern Chinese writers, it was stated by poet and University of Southern California professor Dominic Cheung that [...] "had it not been for the political division between the Nationalist and Communist Chinese, she (Eileen Chang) <b>would</b> have <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> won a Nobel Prize".|$|R
50|$|The scheme got an {{unexpected}} boost when the straitlaced Faber could not pitch {{due to a}} bout with the flu. Years later, Schalk said that if Faber had been available, the fix would have likely never happened, since Faber <b>would</b> have <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> gotten starts that went to Cicotte and/or Williams.|$|R
5|$|Recognising the {{increasing}} congestion in the City and its rapidly growing suburbs, Pearson published a pamphlet in 1845 {{calling for the}} construction of an underground railway through the Fleet valley to Farringdon. The proposed railway would have been an atmospheric railway with trains pushed through tunnels by compressed air. Although the proposal was ridiculed and came to nothing (and <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> have failed if it had been built, due to the shortcomings of the technology proposed), Pearson continued to lobby for a variety of railway schemes throughout the 1840s and 1850s.|$|E
5|$|Burke stated on March 27 that he <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> {{enter the}} draft if Michigan won the {{national}} title. On April 9 before boarding the airplane to return from the NCAA Final Four, head coach Beilein met with Burke, Hardaway, Robinson and McGary to direct them to seek {{the advice of the}} NBA advisory committee. The draft board had until April 15 to develop each individual report and the players have until April 28 to enter the draft. On April 13, reports surfaced that Burke would announce that he would enter the NBA draft at a press conference the following day. On April 14, he entered the 2013 NBA draft.|$|E
5|$|By 1704, the War of the Spanish Succession was in {{its fourth}} year. The {{previous}} year {{had been one of}} success for France and her allies, most particularly on the Danube, where Marshal Villars and the Elector of Bavaria had created a direct threat to Vienna, the Habsburg capital. Vienna had been saved by dissension between the two commanders, leading to the brilliant Villars being replaced by the less dynamic Marshal Marsin. Nevertheless, by 1704, the threat was still real: Rákóczi's Hungarian revolt was already threatening the Empire's eastern approaches, and Marshal Vendôme's forces threatened an invasion from northern Italy. In the courts of Versailles and Madrid, Vienna's fall was confidently anticipated, an event which <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> have led to the collapse of the Grand Alliance.|$|E
50|$|The tour almost {{immediately}} {{results in a}} disaster. While entering the hyperchannel, another ship nearly collides with the Mirror which would have forced the ship {{to end up in}} Brauni space. Alex's Czygu passengers <b>would</b> have <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> been taken prisoner. Fortunately, with Janet's quick thinking, they were able to avoid the collision.|$|R
50|$|However, the {{countries}} top cricketers {{were involved in}} the ICC World Cup in the West Indies, leaving the second tier - such as Tino Mawoyo, Graeme Cremer and Timycen Maruma - with more responsibility than they could handle. The absence of the big name players <b>would</b> have <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> been behind the series of low scores throughout the tournament.|$|R

By all accounts, Darwin was a retiring, methodical an...|$|R
5|$|The most {{frequently}} used argument in favour of dualism appeals to the common-sense intuition that conscious experience is distinct from inanimate matter. If asked what the mind is, the average person would usually respond by identifying it with their self, their personality, their soul, or some other such entity. They <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> deny that the mind simply is the brain, or vice versa, finding {{the idea that there}} is just one ontological entity at play to be too mechanistic, or simply unintelligible. Many modern philosophers of mind think that these intuitions are misleading and that we should use our critical faculties, along with empirical evidence from the sciences, to examine these assumptions to determine whether there is any real basis to them.|$|E
5|$|Even if the ARBiH had not {{provided}} aid, the HV <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> have defeated the Banija Corps on its own, albeit at greater cost. The lack of reserves was the ARSK's key weakness that was exploited by the HV and the ARBiH since the ARSK's static defence could not cope with fast-paced attacks. The ARSK military {{was unable to}} check outflanking manoeuvres and their Special Units Corps failed as a mobile reserve, holding back the HV's 1st Guards Brigade south of Slunj {{for less than a}} single day. The ARSK traditionally counted on the VRS and the Yugoslav military as its strategic reserve, but the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina immobilized the VRS reserves and Yugoslavia did not intervene militarily as Milošević did not order it to do so. Even if he had wished to intervene, the speed of the battle would have allowed a very limited time for Yugoslavia to deploy appropriate reinforcements to support the ARSK.|$|E
5|$|Grace's final {{appearance}} in 1878 {{was for the}} USEE against Twenty of Essex in a two-day match at Witham, starting on Friday, 13 September. The game was played {{for the benefit of}} the Essex and USEE stalwart Frank Silcock. Essex at this time was not a first-class club but capable of providing the USEE with a stern test, especially with odds in their favour, and they had by far the best of a drawn game. Essex scored 175 and 235; USEE replied with 134 and 65–5, so Essex <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> have won with more time. Grace starred with the ball and took a total of 26 wickets. But his indifferent form with the bat haunted him right to the end of the season and he could only score 10 and 4.|$|E
50|$|Thomas had an {{outstanding}} performance in Super Bowl XXV, rushing for 135 {{yards and a}} touchdown, while also catching 5 passes for 55 yards. He <b>would</b> have <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> won the Super Bowl MVP award, but the Bills lost the game 20-19 when kicker Scott Norwood missed a 47-yard field goal attempt with 8 seconds remaining.|$|R
5|$|A {{converted}} {{field goal}} {{would have given}} the Vikings a 10-point lead, which <b>would</b> have <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> clinched victory, according to Pro Football Prospectus and the NFL Network documentary The Missing Rings. Citing a mathematical algorithm by sports analytics company numberFire, The New York Post reported that the Vikings had a 95.23% chance of winning the game had Anderson converted the field goal.|$|R
25|$|A {{major threat}} to the {{township}} was the Trawool Water Scheme (announced for implementation in 1908), which <b>would</b> have <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> meant the drowning of the town. Property values became depressed, and two deputations to the state minister {{did not appear to}} change his mind. Survey work commenced, but the scheme was abandoned before it was completed, in favour of the site at Eildon.|$|R
5|$|In February 1975, Whitlam {{decided to}} appoint Senator Murphy a {{justice of the}} High Court of Australia, even though Murphy's Senate seat would not be up for {{election}} if a half-Senate election were held. Under proportional representation, Labor could win {{three of the five}} New South Wales seats, but if Murphy's seat was also contested, it was most unlikely to win four out of six. Thus, appointing Murphy <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> cost the ALP a Senate seat at the next half-Senate election. Whitlam appointed Murphy anyway. By convention, senators appointed by the state legislature to fill casual vacancies were from the same political party as the former senator. The New South Wales premier, Tom Lewis, felt that this convention only applied to vacancies caused by deaths or ill-health, and arranged for the legislature to elect Cleaver Bunton, former mayor of Albury and an independent.|$|E
5|$|On 7 March 2005 Greater Manchester police {{announced}} that they would stop policing Wigan Athletic matches at the stadium from 2 April. This move <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> {{have resulted in the}} stadium's safety certificate being revoked, effectively forcing the team to play behind closed doors. The move was part of an ongoing dispute between the police force and Dave Whelan surrounding GB£300,000 in unpaid policing costs. The police's decision would not have affected Wigan Warriors, whose games are stewarded instead of policed. The situation was temporarily resolved on 8 March with both sides reaching an agreement that would allow Athletic to play at the ground {{until the end of the}} season. Four months later, Wigan Athletic, facing the prospect of playing their home games in the Premier League in an empty stadium, grudgingly paid the money they owed to the police. The club successfully appealed against the payments in court and won damages from the police.|$|E
5|$|Reedman carried {{instructions}} from Salisbury to {{spend up to}} £3million on European weapons, aircraft and equipment {{as soon as he}} could. The Rhodesian government now believed that it <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> declare independence unilaterally and, knowing the purchase of materiel would be more difficult following this, wished to have the Rhodesian Security Forces' necessary ammunition, weapons, spare parts and other equipment in place beforehand. Soon after arriving in Portugal, Reedman contacted the Lisbon-based Zoio brothers, José, Luiz and Jean, who had recently supplied the Portuguese Armed Forces in Angola with British-made weapons in direct contravention of NATO's embargo against arming Portugal's African-based troops. The Zoios were interested in stocking Rhodesia's arsenal, and promptly agreed to arrange an order of weapons from a third party on Reedman's behalf in exchange for a letter of credit from the Rhodesian government.|$|E
50|$|Nussbaum's {{courtroom}} testimony against Steinberg earned substantial media attention, {{due in part}} to {{her face}} showing obvious evidence of physical trauma. There were also indications, as Nussbaum testified in court, that Lisa had been sexually abused by people outside of her immediate family. During the trial, medical experts testified that while Lisa's injuries were severe, she <b>would</b> have <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> survived if given prompt medical treatment.|$|R
60|$|It {{was of no}} {{use that}} Lucas, Van Dyk, and the Mullers, and other {{experienced}} Dutchmen, tried to dissuade them from their enterprise by assuring them {{that it was a}} ridiculous as well as reckless mode of attack, and <b>would</b> be <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> attended with fatal consequences. The brothers Rennie, as yet inexperienced, were obstinate. They were bent on attacking the lion in his den.|$|R
50|$|In 1902, the Duchess and {{her husband}} {{travelled}} to Russia, where they dined with Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and visited his mother, the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna at the Anichkov Palace. During this visit, the Duchess <b>would</b> have <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> seen the Dowager Empress' large collection of Fabergé items, which perhaps inspired her to order this egg. The egg {{is believed to have}} cost over 5,000 rubles.|$|R
5|$|Thucydides {{says that}} 200 Phoenician ships were {{captured}} and destroyed. It {{is highly unlikely}} that this occurred during the apparently brief naval battle, so these were probably grounded ships captured after the battle and destroyed with fire, as has been the case at Mycale. Plutarch says that 200 ships were captured, in addition to those that were destroyed or fled. It is possible that 'destroyed' in this context means sunk during the battle, since the Greeks <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> have destroyed the ships that they captured as well (as Thucydides indeed implies). Since Thucydides only explicitly gives the number of ships destroyed, it is possible to reconcile Plutarch's and Thucydides's numbers, {{but it is not clear}} that this is the best approach. There are no estimates in the ancient sources for casualties amongst the troops of either side.|$|E
5|$|Tuvia Raviv's armored brigade {{began its}} diversionary {{attack against the}} 16th Division's {{bridgehead}} at 5:00 PM on October 15, striking at the bridgehead's center from the east, after a fire preparation. It was repulsed by the Egyptians, as had been expected, but succeeded in its purpose. When the 16th Division's southern flank came under increasing Israeli attack, the Egyptians assumed that the Israeli objective was to roll up the Second Army's right flank, not to open a corridor {{to the west bank}} for Israeli forces to cross the canal. For the next 24 hours, this remained the general impression among Egyptian commanders, and they reacted accordingly. Had they discovered the Israelis' true intentions earlier, the Egyptians <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> have been able to defeat the Israeli operation, in light of the greater strength of their forces and reserves near the Deversoir area, on the east and west banks of the Suez Canal.|$|E
5|$|Bede {{sometimes}} {{included in}} his theological books an {{acknowledgement of the}} predecessors on whose works he drew. In two cases he left instructions that his marginal notes, which gave {{the details of his}} sources, should be preserved by the copyist, and he may have originally added marginal comments about his sources to others of his works. Where he does not specify, it is still possible to identify books to which he must have had access by quotations that he uses. A full catalogue of the library available to Bede in the monastery cannot be reconstructed, but it is possible to tell, for example, that Bede was very familiar with the works of Virgil. There is little evidence that he had access to any other of the pagan Latin writers—he quotes many of these writers but the quotes are almost all {{to be found in the}} Latin grammars that were common in his day, one or more of which would certainly have been at the monastery. Another difficulty is that manuscripts of early writers were often incomplete: it is apparent that Bede had access to Pliny's Encyclopedia, for example, but it seems that the version he had was missing book xviii, as he <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> have quoted from it in his De temporum ratione.|$|E
50|$|The {{collection}} {{appears to}} have been compiled from two different versions: according to some verses there were 300 men of the Gododdin, and only one, Cynon ap Clydno, survived; in others there were 363 warriors and three survivors, in addition to the poet, who as a bard <b>would</b> have <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> not have been counted as one of the warriors. The names of about eighty warriors are given in the poem.|$|R
50|$|Bonanno {{was awarded}} most of Maranzano's crime family. At age 26, Bonanno {{became one of}} the youngest-ever bosses of a crime family. Years later, Bonanno wrote in his {{autobiography}} {{that he did not know}} about the plan to kill Maranzano, but this is highly unlikely; Luciano <b>would</b> have <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> had him killed as well had he still been loyal to Maranzano. In any case, Bonanno had no interest in starting another gang war to avenge his predecessor and quickly reconciled with Luciano.|$|R
40|$|The Stanley Miller {{experiment}} {{suggests that}} amino acid-based life is ubiquitous in our universe, although its varieties {{are not likely}} to have followed the particular, highly contingent and path-dependent, evolutionary trajectory found on Earth. Are many alien organisms likely to be conscious in ways that we <b>would</b> recognize? <b>Almost</b> <b>certainly.</b> Will some develop high order technology? Less likely, but still fairly probable. If so, will we be able to communicate with them? Only on a basic level, and only with profound difficulty. The argument is fairly direct...|$|R
5|$|Deeply in debt, William made {{multiple}} {{attempts at}} marrying a wealthy heiress such as Catherine Tylney-Long, but his suits were unsuccessful. Following {{the death of}} William's niece Princess Charlotte of Wales, then second-in-line to the British throne, in 1817, the king was left with twelve children, but no legitimate grandchildren. The race was on among the royal dukes to marry and produce an heir. William had great advantages in this race—his two older brothers were both childless and estranged from their wives, who were both beyond childbearing age anyway, and William was the healthiest of the three. If he lived long enough, he <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> ascend the British and Hanoverian thrones, and {{have the opportunity to}} sire the next monarch. William's initial choices of potential wives either met with the disapproval of his eldest brother, the Prince of Wales, or turned him down. William's younger brother Adolphus, the Duke of Cambridge, was sent to Germany to scout out the available Protestant princesses; he came up with Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel, but her father Frederick declined the match. Two months later, the Duke of Cambridge married Augusta himself. Eventually, a princess was found who was amiable, home-loving, and was willing to accept, even enthusiastically welcoming William's nine surviving children, several of whom had not yet reached adulthood. In the Drawing Room at Kew Palace on 11 July 1818, William married Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, the daughter of George I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. At 25, Adelaide was half William's age.|$|E

25|$|Ratiu etal. and Van Horn etal. both {{concluded}} that the superior sagittal sinus must have remained intact, both because Harlow does not mention loss of cerebrospinal fluid through the nose, and because otherwise Gage <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> have suffered fatal blood loss or air embolism.|$|E
5000|$|The {{play was}} a {{critical}} point for the 2002 Ohio State Buckeyes football team, as an incomplete pass (or a failed first-down conversion) would have likely resulted in a loss to Purdue, which in turn, <b>would</b> have <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> removed Ohio State from National Championship contention. The nickname [...] "Holy Buckeye" [...] is a play on other similar expressions (i.e., [...] "holy cow", [...] "holy mackerel", etc.) and came from Brent Musburger, the ABC television play-by-play announcer, who exclaimed the phrase as the completion was made.|$|R
50|$|By 1929, each {{of these}} {{companies}} had essentially outgrown its usefulness to the industry. For most of them, the market had some time earlier reached a saturation point. In some instances, their machines were badly dated and rapidly approaching obsolescence. For {{each of these}} companies to have attempted further activity on solo basis <b>would</b> <b>almost</b> have <b>certainly</b> been disastrous. By uniting their various and somewhat diverse product lines into a single company, Oliver Farm Equipment instantly became a virtual full-line manufacturer.|$|R
50|$|By late 1937, {{relations}} with the Lieutenant-Governor became so strained that Bowen even threatened to dismiss Aberhart's government, {{which would have been}} an extraordinary use of his reserve powers. An analogus situation occurred in 1932 in Australia between Jack Lang and Sir Philip Game, the Premier and Governor, respectively, of New South Wales. However, Bowen did not follow through on his threat due in part to Social Credit's immense popularity with the people. Had he dismissed Aberhart, it would have triggered a fresh election that Social Credit <b>would</b> have <b>almost</b> <b>certainly</b> won.|$|R
