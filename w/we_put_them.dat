500|$|The New 52 ongoing {{series are}} {{organized}} under seven different [...] "families," [...] grouping similar characters or themes within the books together. By {{the release of}} the October 2013 solicitations, DC was no longer grouping the titles by these families. They instead began releasing one larger solicit, titled [...] "The New 52 Group". However, titles that were not participating in an event for the month, such as [...] "Forever Evil", were still grouped together in the larger solicit by the previous family headings. In September 2014, DC co-publisher Dan DiDio spoke about classifying the titles into the families, saying, [...] "one of the things we did, when we launched the New 52, we broke those classifications up {{in a way that we}} were able to draw attention to all the characters. So <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> in groupings so we would be able to promote and help them draw attention in groups. It was never made to be a certain amount different stuff. We always want to have different styles of product... with a lot of characters, we're careful. Things like Frankenstein and Grifter and Voodoo and things of that nature, which were really risky characters and risky chances for us to take, and we're very happy to do them. Even though they didn't work, we knew there was value in those characters... We think they brought a lot of value to the launch. They brought a lot of breadth and depth to the line of books, and a diversity to the line. We didn't want to put them out and then forget about them. It was very important to make sure that they were prominent in other series, and that's why <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> in" [...] other series.|$|E
500|$|In 1997, the Strokes {{consisted}} of singer Julian Casablancas, guitarist Nick Valensi, bassist Nikolai Fraiture, and drummer Fabrizio Moretti. Casablancas's stepfather and Moretti's and Fraiture's older brothers introduced the quartet {{to the music}} of reggae artist Bob Marley, protopunk group the Velvet Underground, and alternative rock band Jane's Addiction. Discussing the formative stages of the group, Moretti noted, [...] "Our music was, like, , but trying to be classical. We all took music classes and tried writing songs, and when <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> together they were this crazy amalgam of insane ideas that we thought was really cool." [...] In 1998, Albert Hammond, Jr., who Casablancas knew from his time at a Swiss boarding school, moved to New York City to attend film school and joined The Strokes as a second guitarist. His arrival provided the catalyst for the band's musical and emotional evolution.|$|E
500|$|Another VFX {{supervisor}} from Zoic Studios, Andrew Orloff, {{believed the}} episode's special effects were {{possibly the most}} difficult of the season. He wrote, [...] "Originally, {{it was supposed to be}} a practical effect but they couldn't get it to fall in a natural way, so what we had to do was shoot the practical elements in pieces and <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> all together and timed all those plates and ended up rebuilding a significant part of it and tying it all together in CG. So we took a cyberscan of the guy's body, and on top of all the practical elements we used as a base, we had a matte painting, a reveal matte painting of the cracks that ran through the body, 3D particles of large chunks of ash falling out, 3D particles of small ash bits floating down, residual dust flying off of it and, at one point, his head falls off and crashes to the ground as ash. So we had to do a full-CG head and tumble it down the body. That was pretty complicated and entailed lots of R there was 2D work in After Effects, tracking, retiming, we did a lot of CG lighting for the body parts in Maya/mental ray and all of the particles were a combination of Maya software, and rendered in Maya/mental ray." ...|$|E

2500|$|Mayday Parade {{was formed}} {{in the winter of}} 2005 {{following}} the merger of two local Tallahassee bands, Kid Named Chicago and Defining Moment. Kid Named Chicago featured vocalist/guitarist Jason Lancaster, guitarist Alex Garcia and drummer Jake Bundrick, while Defining Moment featured vocalist Derek Sanders, guitarist Brooks Betts, and bassist Jeremy Lenzo. Both bands previously practiced in the same building, before it occurred to Lenzo that it [...] "made more sense if <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> together instead of playing separately." [...] After composing [...] "When I Get Home, You're So Dead" [...] and [...] "Three Cheers for Five Years", the group realised they had [...] "something special". Tales Told by Dead Friends was recorded at Earthsound Recording, in Valdosta, Georgia. Recording was handled by Lee Dyess, who also did mixing. Dan Shike mastered the EP at Tone and Volume Mastering in Nashville, Tennessee. The group recorded the EP [...] "as fast as we could." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2011 Wal-Mart {{recalled}} {{a quantity of}} infant formula after a baby died in Missouri. [...] "We extend our deepest condolences to this baby boy's family {{as they try to}} come to grips with their loss," [...] said Dianna Gee, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman. [...] "As soon as we heard what happened, we immediately reached out to the manufacturer of the formula and to the Department of Health and Senior Services to provide any information we may have to help with the investigation." [...] Wal-Mart said it pulled a batch of Enfamil from its stores nationwide that matched the size and lot number ZP1k7G of the formula that may have sickened the baby in Missouri, Gee said. The baby formula was purchased from a Wal-Mart in Lebanon, Missouri. After the purchase, a 10-day-old infant died from a rare bacterial infection, CNN affiliate KYTV reported. Authorities ran tests to determine if the death came from the formula, the water to make the formula or any other factor, said Mead Johnson Nutrition, the company that makes Enfamil. [...] "We are highly confident in the safety and quality of our products – and the rigorous testing <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> through," [...] said Chris Perille, a Mead Johnson Nutrition spokesman.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's too bad we didn't {{bring some}} wooden dishes with us," [...] remarked Randy. [...] "Then, {{after we had}} used <b>them,</b> <b>we</b> could <b>put</b> <b>'em</b> in the fire." ...|$|R
50|$|After {{some time}} they gained {{confidence}} amd came so near as {{to take a}} handkerchief and other trifles <b>we</b> <b>put</b> towards <b>them</b> on an oar... having given them all the boat afforded I left them apparently well satisfied.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ay, I remember, old lady. But we hadn't tried {{what it was}} to {{have the}} rest then. Our new shoes had come home, but <b>we</b> hadn't <b>put</b> <b>'em</b> on. We're wearing 'em now, we're wearing 'em, and must step out accordingly.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One by one," [...] said Geoffrey, who was {{a little}} drunk: [...] "One by one <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> out of the field, they are hors de combat. Who remains? Pacohuila, Walgatchka, Allaye--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is our cooperage," [...] said he. [...] "We {{have the}} staves sent out in bundles, and <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> {{together}} ourselves. Now, you don't see anything particularly sinister about this building, do you?" ...|$|E
60|$|It will {{facilitate}} {{the examination of}} these if <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> for the moment aside, and pass to the other division of our dilemma, the question, namely, what kind of lives our gentlemen and ladies are to live, for whom all this hard work is to be done.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{more the}} merrier, Uncle John," [...] the young skipper replied. [...] "There are none others going this journey, so though our {{accommodation}} {{is not very}} extensive, <b>we</b> can <b>put</b> <b>them</b> up comfortably enough if they don't mind roughing it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's the queer {{part of the}} story. I {{had three}} others. Perfectly fresh eggs. Well, <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>'em</b> in the boat, and then I {{went up to the}} tent to make some coffee, leaving my two heathens down by the beach--the one fooling about with his sting and the other helping him. It never {{occurred}} to me that the beggars would take advantage of the peculiar position I was in to pick a quarrel. But I suppose the centipede poison and the kicking I had given him had upset the one--he was always a cantankerous sort--and he persuaded the other.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Let us go in {{for life}} together. We've both done {{uncommon}} well. I'm spending 30,000 dollars a year,--at that rate,--in my own house. You'll see it all. If <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> both together,--what's yours and what's mine,--we can put our foot {{out as far as}} about any one there, I guess.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There are {{distinct}} fragments," [...] Laura continued, [...] "of embroidered stuff {{such as the}} Salvation Army girl might have been wearing. <b>We</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> on one side, but they aren't enough evidence.

60|$|Colman. We {{must make}} {{something}} {{if we are}} to live. But it is more than that I was thinking of; we might coax some of the youngsters to come and learn the basket making; it would make them take to us better if <b>we</b> could <b>put</b> <b>them</b> in the way of earning a few pence.|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, sir, <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> {{on because}} {{we did not want}} to be {{impressed}} by the first ship that came in, but preferred to wait a bit till we saw one to suit us. I see, sir, that you have shipped a swab. That means, of course, that you have got a lieutenancy. I congratulate you indeed, sir, on your promotion.” ...|$|E
60|$|I granted this presently, {{and joined}} my Englishman with them; and we {{concealed}} the man, {{and his wife}} and daughters, on board our ship, till the sloop put out to go to sea; and then (having put all their goods on board the sloop some time before) <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> on board the sloop, after she was got out of the bay.|$|E
60|$|MITCHENER. I never {{supposed}} {{it would}} make much difference. What I cant stand is giving in to that Pankhurst lot. Hang it all, Balsquith, it seems only yesterday that <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> in quod for a month. I {{said at the time}} that it ought to have been ten years. If my advice had been taken this wouldnt have happened. Its a consolation to me that events are proving how thoroughly right I was.|$|E

5000|$|Rafi Sela, an Israeli airport {{security}} expert who helped design security at Ben Gurion International Airport, has said: [...] "I don't know why everybody is running to buy these expensive and useless machines.

6000|$|All {{this was}} too much for Marian's weak strength, and before long she was again {{whirling}} round with Captain Ewing.

6000|$|... "I {{suppose they}} are getting on all right," [...] she said. [...] "I have done nothing {{for the last two}} days but try them on. You see, <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> out to three milliners, and they all three seem to reach the same point together, and I start after breakfast, and it takes about two hours at each place.

6000|$|... "I propose," [...] Forrest answered, [...] "that we {{narrow the}} issues, and that <b>we</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> before him in plain English, now--to-night--while the courage {{is still with}} us. It must be silence or death. I tell you frankly how it is with me. I would as soon press a pistol to my {{forehead}} and pull the trigger as have this boy {{go back into the}} world and tell his story. For you, too, it would be ruin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, señors," [...] Dias said; [...] "it {{is quite}} safe. <b>We</b> have <b>put</b> <b>them</b> all to sleep. Here are their muskets and pistols.
