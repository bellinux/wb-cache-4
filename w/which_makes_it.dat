5|$|When it {{finishes}} its moult migration, {{this bird}} moults its remiges between August and September, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> unable to fly. This moult is preceded {{by an increase}} in weight. During the moult, the breast muscles atrophy. When the moult is completed, this grebe continues to gain weight, often more than doubling its original weight.|$|E
5|$|Alcoholism is characterised by an {{increased}} tolerance to alcohol–which means {{that an individual}} can consume more alcohol–and physical dependence on alcohol, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> hard for an individual to control their consumption. The physical dependency caused by alcohol can lead to an affected individual having a very strong urge to drink alcohol. These characteristics play a role decreasing an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking. Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide. A depressed mood is a common symptom of heavy alcohol drinkers.|$|E
5|$|Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir (Out of {{the depths}} I call, Lord, to You), , is a church cantata by the German {{composer}} Johann Sebastian Bach. It was composed in either 1707 or 1708, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> one of Bach's earliest cantatas. Some sources {{suggest that it}} could be his earliest surviving work in this form, but current thinking is that there are one or two earlier examples.|$|E

All player weapons except the fist require ammunition, which can be collected in power-ups. All weapons, again {{with the exception of}} the fist, have a secondary mode <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> have a different effect than in primary mode. The player has health and shields which are damaged by enemy attacks and some environmental hazards, and may be replenished through power-ups.|$|E
5|$|Ganymede (Jupiter III), {{the third}} Galilean moon {{is named after}} the mythological Ganymede, cupbearer of the Greek gods and Zeus's beloved. Ganymede is the largest natural {{satellite}} in the Solar System at 5262.4 kilometers in diameter, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> larger than the planet Mercury – although only at about half of its mass since Ganymede is an icy world. It is the only satellite in the Solar System known to possess a magnetosphere, likely created through convection within the liquid iron core.|$|E

5|$|Metis has an {{irregular}} shape and measures 60×40×34km across, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> the second {{smallest of the}} four inner satellites of Jupiter. Therefore, a very rough estimate of its surface area could be placed between 5,800 and 11,600 square kilometers (approx. 8,700). The bulk composition and mass of Metis are not known, but assuming that its mean density is like that of Amalthea (~0.86g/cm3), its mass can be estimated as ~3.6×1016kg. This density would imply that it is composed of water ice with a porosity of 10–15%.|$|E
5|$|Miss Malini marked Narayan's {{earliest}} use {{of story}} elements that would recur {{in some of}} his later novels. It was later rewritten by him as the 1949 novel Mr. Sampath– The Printer of Malgudi, which in turn was adapted into the Hindi film Mr. Sampat (1952) directed by S. S. Vasan, and a 1972 Tamil film directed by Cho Ramaswamy. Although no print of Miss Malini is known to survive, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> a lost film, surviving artefacts include its songs, along with a few stills and newspaper advertisements.|$|E
5|$|Service design {{management}} differs {{in several ways}} from product {{design management}}. For example, the application of international trading strategies of services is difficult because the evolution of service 'from a craftsmanship attitude to industrialization of services' requires {{the development of new}} tools, approaches, and policies. Whereas goods can be manufactured centrally and delivered around the globe, services have to be performed at the place of consumption, <b>which</b> <b>makes</b> <b>it</b> difficult to achieve global quality consistency and effective cost control.|$|E
