[...] "Diamonds are hard" [...] only possesses meaning when stated (or believed) at some specific situation, by some specific person, uttered (or believed) for some specific aim. It is the consequences the statement holds for that person’s purposes which constitute its meaning, and its usefulness in accomplishing that person’s purposes that constitutes the statement’s truth or falsity. After all, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> sentence [...] "diamonds are hard" [...] in a particular situation we may find it actually has {{nothing to say about}} diamonds. A speaker may very well be using the sentence as a joke, as a codephrase, or even simply {{as an example of a}} sentence with 15 letters. Which the sentence really means cannot be determined without the specific purpose a person might be using the statement for in a specific context.|$|E

[...] Although he found the new songs [...] "arbitrary in terms of sequencing", Pitchforks Ian Cohen cited the compilation as [...] "some of the best music of the young decade; judging by its already pervasive influence, it's safe to say Trilogy (or at least House of Balloons) will be one of those records that will be viewed as a turning point <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> 2010s as a whole." ...|$|E

6000|$|Now my own fear {{touching}} {{anything in}} the way of phonetic spelling is that it would simply increase this tendency to use words as counters and not as coins. The original life in a word (as in the word [...] "talent") burns low as it is: sensible spelling might extinguish it altogether. Suppose any sentence you like: suppose a man says, [...] "Republics generally encourage holidays." [...] It looks like the top line of a copy-book. Now, it is perfectly true that if you wrote that sentence exactly as it is pronounced, even by highly educated people, the sentence would run: [...] "Ripubliks jenrally inkurrij hollidies." [...] It looks ugly: but I have not the smallest objection to ugliness. My objection is that these four words have each a history and hidden treasures in them: that this history and hidden treasure (which we tend to forget too much as it is) phonetic spelling tends to make us forget altogether. Republic does not mean merely a mode of political choice.

And that expression, too, of the pansy named Love-in-Idleness, has been described, coarsely or rudely it may be, in some of its country names: [...] "Kiss me behind the garden gate," [...] and, better (or worse) still, [...] "Meet-her-i'-th'-entry-kiss-her-i'-th'-buttery."
