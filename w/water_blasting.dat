25|$|One of {{the largest}} {{mechanical}} uses of dry ice is blast cleaning. Dry ice pellets are shot from a nozzle with compressed air, combining {{the power of the}} speed of the pellets with the action of the sublimation. This can remove residues from industrial equipment. Examples of materials removed include ink, glue, oil, paint, mold and rubber. Dry ice blasting can replace sandblasting, steam blasting, <b>water</b> <b>blasting</b> or solvent blasting. The primary environmental residue of dry ice blasting is the sublimed CO2, thus making it a useful technique where residues from other blasting techniques are undesirable. Recently, blast cleaning has been introduced as a method of removing smoke damage from structures after fires.|$|E

50|$|Hydro {{blasting}} {{is not a}} form of {{abrasive blasting}} as no abrasive media is used. Hydro-blasting, commonly known as <b>water</b> <b>blasting,</b> is commonly used because it usually requires only one operator. In hydro-blasting, a highly pressured stream of water is used to remove old paint, chemicals, or buildup without damaging the original surface. This method is ideal for cleaning internal and external surfaces because the operator is generally able to send the stream of water into places {{that are difficult to}} reach using other methods. Another benefit of hydro-blasting is the ability to recapture and reuse the water, reducing waste and mitigating environmental impact.|$|E

40|$|Finite element {{simulations}} of rubber protective coatings with different structures under two dynamic loading cases were performed. They were monolithic coating and honey-comb structures {{with three different}} cell topologies (hexachiral honeycomb, reentrant honeycomb, and circular honeycomb). The two loading cases were a dynamic compres-sion load and <b>water</b> <b>blast</b> shock wave. The dynamic mechanical responses of those coat-ings under these two loading cases were compared. Finite element simulations have been undertaken using the ABAQUS/EXPLICIT software package to provide insights into the coat-ing’s working mechanism and the relation between compression behavior and <b>water</b> <b>blast</b> shock resistance. The rubber materials were modeled as hyperelastic materials. The reac-tion force {{was selected as the}} major comparative criterion. It is concluded that when under dynamic compressive load, the cell topology played an important role at high speed, and when under underwater explosion, the honeycomb coatings can improve the shock resistance significantly at the initial stage.

50|$|Dry-ice {{blasting}} involves propelling pellets at {{extremely high}} speeds. The actual dry-ice pellets are quite soft, {{and much less}} dense than other media used in blast-cleaning (i.e. sand or plastic pellets). Upon impact, the pellet sublimates almost immediately, transferring minimal kinetic energy to the surface on impact and producing minimal abrasion. The sublimation process absorbs a large volume of heat from the surface, producing shear stresses due to thermal shock. This is assumed to improve cleaning as {{the top layer of}} dirt or contaminant is expected to transfer more heat than the underlying substrate and flake off more easily. The efficiency and effectiveness of this process depends on the thermal conductivity of the substrate and contaminant. The rapid change in state from solid to gas also causes microscopic shock waves, which are also thought to assist in removing the contaminant. Dry Ice Blasting is nonabrasive, nonconductive and nonflammable. Dry Ice Blasting generates no additional waste or secondary contamination unlike media and <b>water</b> <b>blasting.</b>|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{the study}} were to carry out a {{comparison}} of grit blasting and other surface pretreatment processes and identify the relation between grit blasting parameters and coating adhesion, because it can be assumed that the adhesion between substrate and coating strongly depends on the physical properties of the substrate surface. By this way, in order to improve the bonding between substrate and coating, it is necessary to study the influence of different surface pre-treatment parameters and to compare different pre-treatment techniques. Grit <b>blasting,</b> <b>water</b> jet <b>blasting</b> and mechanicals processes (milling and grinding) have been studied. In order to compare them, the roughness of the surface, the adhesive straights, the topography, the contact surface and the residual stresses have been the considered parameters to carry out the research. Two different substrates have been studied, AlMg 7 and St_ 42. For grit blasting, five different blasting parameters have been analyzed and combined to obtain reliable results, attack angle, air pressure, lineal velocity, number of passes, and distance between substrate and nozzle. After measuring the obtained values, the most influence parameters were recombined and analyzed to obtain better surface conditions. In the case of mechanicals processes (milling and grinding), the samples were studied for different mechanical parameters, analyzed and compared with the other surface pretreatments in order to obtain the most suitable method. For <b>water</b> jet <b>blasting,</b> eight samples were sent to WLH (University of Hannover) to be treated. To carry out the pretreatment, the velocity of the <b>water</b> jet <b>blasting</b> was modify while the other blasting parameters remained constant, in order to compare the obtained values of roughness, adhesion, activate area and residual stresses for water jet with grit blasting and mechanical processes. The next conclusions can be assumed: The roughness is not so important than the topography to obtain the best adhesive bonding between the substrate and the coating, and the best bonding was obtained for homogeneous topographies (obtained for <b>water</b> jet <b>blasting</b> and grit blasting). Comparing the surface pretreatments is observed that <b>water</b> jet <b>blasting</b> is the surface pretreatment method which leads to the highest bonding between substrate and coating. It can be assumed that a higher contact surface area leads to a better adhesion between substrate and coating. The residual stresses strongly depend on the surface pretreatment used. Grit blasting leads to the highest compressive stresses while <b>water</b> jet <b>blasting</b> almost does not cause variations and grinding obtains the same values than for a raw surface (untreated surface).

5000|$|Except {{for very}} common sizes, liners {{are not usually}} stocked and must be made {{specifically}} for each project. CIPP requires bypass of the flow in the existing pipeline while the liner is being installed. The curing may take from one hour to 30 hours depending on pipe diameter and curing system (steam / water / uv) and must be carefully monitored, inspected, and tested. Obstructions in the existing pipeline, such as protruding laterals, must be removed prior to installation. Cost should be compared with similar methods such as Shotcrete, thermoformed pipe, close-fit pipe, spiral wound pipe and sliplining as these other methods can provide a similar design solution for similar or less cost in certain situations. CIPP must also be carefully monitored for release of chemical agents utilized in the reaction process for contamination downstream of rehabilitated pipes. The liner material used for common sizes is normally a felted fabric (non-woven) and does not go around bends well without wrinkling and going out of round on corners. Liners used for pipes with bends (particularly 100 mm pipes) are made from a woven fabric allowing it to go around bends with minimal wrinkling.

50|$|When {{creating}} hydrophobic concrete {{through a}} coating process, a coating is sprayed or brushed onto a porous surfaces. In most cases, it {{is applied to}} a regular concrete slab that then undergoes a corrosive process to expose more of the concrete’s capillaries. This {{can be achieved by}} <b>water</b> <b>blasting</b> the surface at about 3,000-4,000 psi. Sandblasting and acid etching are also suitable processes. The addition of water is the next step. It can be applied either vertically or horizontally, but temperatures should not go below 33 degrees Fahrenheit to prevent freezing. Excessive evaporation should also be avoided. In areas with high evaporation rates, this process often takes place overnight when temperatures are cooler. Once the pores are saturated as much as possible with water, the coating is applied. Hydrophobic chemicals are in a powder form and mixed with water at a ratio of five parts powder to two parts water for application by brush. For spray application, the ratio is five parts powder to three parts water. The coating is applied between 1.25-1.5 lb per square yard and continues until the whole surface is covered. If the surface requires another coat, it must be applied within forty eight hours of the initial application of the hydrophobic mixture. Once applied, the concrete must cure in a moist environment two to three hours after the application. This is achieved by spraying the surface with water {{at least three times a}} day for a few days. Evaporation retardants are also ccasionally used. Depending on the climate, the curing process may take longer and require more frequent wetting. Once the concrete is cured, it sits for two to three weeks before the process is complete.|$|E
