5|$|According to Plutarch, one {{tradition}} had it {{that the}} Persian king (who at the time <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> been Xerxes) agreed a humiliating peace treaty {{in the aftermath of}} the Eurymedon. However, as Plutarch admits, other authors denied that such a peace was made at this time, and the more logical date for any peace treaty would have been after the Cyprus campaign of 450 BC. The alternative suggested by Plutarch is that the Persian king acted as if he had made a humiliating peace with the Greeks, because he was so fearful of engaging in battle with them again. It is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a peace treaty was made in the aftermath of Eurymedon.|$|E
5|$|FIFA {{president}} Jules Rimet intervened, {{and eventually}} four European teams {{made the trip}} by sea: Belgium, France, Romania, and Yugoslavia. The Romanians, managed by Constantin Rădulescu and coached by their captain Rudolf Wetzer and Octav Luchide, entered the competition following the intervention of newly crowned King CarolII. He selected the squad personally, and negotiated with employers {{to ensure that the}} players <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> jobs upon their return. The French entered at the personal intervention of Rimet, but neither France's star defender Manuel Anatol nor the team's regular coach Gaston Barreau could be persuaded to make the trip. The Belgians participated at the instigation of German-Belgian FIFA vice-president Rodolphe Seeldrayers.|$|E
5|$|For instance, {{if he had}} 100,000 strings {{worth of}} gold and silver and used this money to buy {{productive}} property, in a year he would gain 10,000 strings; after ten years or so, he would have regained the 100,000 strings {{and what would be}} divided among the family would be interest. If it were invested in a pawn broking business, in three years the interest would equal the capital. He <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> the 100,000 strings, and the rest, being interest, could be divided. Moreover, it could be doubled again in another three years, ad infinitum.|$|E

5|$|In 2009 {{the sails}} were {{replaced}} and the mill re-thatched and restored by local craftsmen {{at a cost}} of a £100,000; the mill was re-opened later that year. The work was funded by the Grantscape Community Heritage Fund. Although the sails do not rotate with the wind, they are moved 90 degrees four times per year for maintenance. Before the restoration work was undertaken surveys revealed that the mill was used as a roost for long-eared and lesser horseshoe bats. It was ensured that the bats <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> access after the restoration.|$|E
5|$|On March 26, 2001, Heisley {{announced}} that he had selected Memphis. Memphis and Louisville were the most promising cities, with Heisley selecting Memphis because it offered a better deal and because of poor local executive leadership in Louisville. The choice <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> to be studied by a five-member NBA group before permission was granted from the league. The team's final game at GM Place was a 95–100 loss against the Houston Rockets on April 14; the team's final game as a Vancouver-based franchise was a road 95–81 win against the Golden State Warriors on April 18.|$|E
5|$|Rieber has {{suggested}} a {{package for the}} politicians, where he would create a company that would borrow money to build both the Ulriken Tunnel, a shortening of the line from Hønefoss to Sandvika (the Ringerike Line) and electrify the railway. Since NSB based their fares on the route length traveled, financing would be covered by a surcharge equal to the distance saved; ticket price would remain the same and within twenty years the debt would be covered. The government opposed the suggestion—Trygve Bratteli commenting {{that even though the}} financing was private, it <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> to use the same funding as government debt, and would jeopardize other projects, like the Nordland Line.|$|E

5|$|The {{cemetery}} {{consists of}} neat lines of graves arranged on an east–west alignment, covering a nearly square area of about , in a layout {{not seen in}} any other known Anglo-Saxon cemetery. The enclosure within which the cemetery was laid out was many centuries older, dating to about 200BC; {{the establishment of a}} cemetery within its boundaries was probably intended to serve as a deliberate link to the past. It <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> been clearly visible in Saxon times. The layout of the cemetery seem to have consciously reflected that of the earlier enclosure, with its apparent main entrance aligned with that of the enclosure.|$|E
5|$|As title holders, Manchester City were {{entitled}} to defend the Cup Winners' Cup in the 1970–71 season. Had they not won the trophy, they <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> been qualified for European competition, as City's victory in the 1970 League Cup granted {{a place in the}} Fairs Cup. As a UEFA-organised competition, the Cup Winners' Cup took precedence over the Fairs Cup, and so the club took a place in the former. In the first round Manchester City almost suffered an upset at the hands of Linfield, from Belfast. City held a one-goal lead after the first leg, but Linfield twice took the lead in the second leg. The match finished 2–1 to Linfield, and Manchester City progressed on the away goals rule. Honvéd were the opposition in the second round. Manchester City won both legs, the score 3–0 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Castellaneta started acting {{after his}} {{graduation}} from Northern Illinois University in 1979. He {{decided that if}} his career went nowhere he <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> a chance to try something else. He began taking improvisation classes, where he met his future wife Deb Lacusta. Castellaneta started to work at The Second City, an improvisational theatre in Chicago, in 1983 and continued to work there until 1987. During this period, he did voice-over work with his wife for various radio stations. He auditioned for a role in The Tracey Ullman Show and his first meeting underwhelmed Tracey Ullman and the other producers. Ullman decided to fly to Chicago to watch Castellaneta perform. His performance that night was about a blind man who tries to become a comedian and Ullman later recalled that although there were flashier performances that night, Castellaneta made her cry. She was impressed and Castellaneta was hired.|$|E

5|$|If the German {{air force}} had prevailed and {{attempted}} a landing, a much-reduced Royal Air Force {{would have been}} obliged to operate from airfields {{well away from the}} southeast of England. Any airfield that was in danger of being captured would have been made inoperable and there were plans to remove all portable equipment from vulnerable radar bases and completely destroy anything that could not be moved. Whatever was left of the RAF would have been committed to intercepting the invasion fleet in concert with the Royal Navy—to fly in the presence of an enemy that enjoys air superiority is very dangerous. However, the RAF would have kept several advantages, such as being able to operate largely over friendly territory, as well as having the ability to fly for longer as, until the Germans were able to operate from airfields in England, Luftwaffe pilots <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> to fly significant distances to reach their operational area.|$|E
5|$|In August 2001, an {{expedition}} {{headed by the}} marine archaeologist and author Clive Cussler announced that they had found {{the remains of a}} ship embedded in the Rochelois reef. Only a few pieces of timber and some metal artifacts could be salvaged, the remainder of the wreckage being lost within the coral. Initial tests on the wood indicated that it was the type extensively used in New York shipyards at the time of Mary Celestes 1872 refit, and it seemed the remains of the Mary Celeste had been found. However, dendrochronological tests carried out by Scott St George of the Geological Survey of Canada showed that the wood came from trees, most probably from the US state of Georgia, that <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> been growing in 1894, about ten years after the Mary Celestes demise.|$|E
5|$|In {{early summer}} 1165, Pope Alexander III wrote twice to Foliot, {{ordering}} him to intercede {{with the king}} and protest the royal injunction against appeals to the papacy. Foliot replied that the king respected the pope, heard his protests carefully, and that the archbishop had not been expelled, but had left of his own accord. Foliot wrote that the king had said Becket was free to return at any time, but <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> to answer to the charges he had faced at Northampton. Foliot then advised the pope not to impose any sentences of excommunication and to be patient and continue to negotiate. In 1166, Foliot accused Becket of simony, or the purchase of church offices, basing this on the alleged purchase Becket had made of the chancellorship, {{although there is no}} evidence that Becket bought the office. By 1166, the king had made Foliot the head of the English Church, in fact if not in law. The king and Foliot got along well, and it was probably Foliot's influence that kept the king from more violent measures against Becket.|$|E
50|$|In a piece {{apparently}} from Fyens Stiftstidende in 1999, it {{is claimed}} that the original name of the place was Voldsmose.

50|$|The United States Senate {{elections}} of 1810 and 1811 were elections {{that had the}} majority Democratic-Republican Party gain one seat in the United States Senate. The minority Federalists {{had gone into the}} elections with such a small share of Senate seats (7 out of 34, or 20.6%) that they had won all of the elections, they <b>would</b> <b>still</b> not <b>have</b> controlled a majority.|$|R
5|$|In {{the electoral}} college, {{the vote was}} more decisive. As expected, Hancock carried the South and border states, but Garfield swept {{all but one of}} the Northern states (the {{exception}} was New Jersey, which he lost by just two thousand votes). Both candidates carried nineteen states, but Garfield’s triumphs in the more populous North translated into a 214–155 electoral college victory. The sectional divide of the vote more deeply enforced the Republicans' retreat from the South after Reconstruction, and demonstrated that they could win without competing there. Weaver's resistance to fusion had no effect on the result; the combined Democratic and Greenback vote would have carried Indiana, but not any other of the states Garfield won, and the result <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> been a Republican majority in the electoral college. Hancock was convinced that the Republicans won New York by fraud. Lacking evidence, and mindful of the turmoil caused by the disputed election four years earlier, the Democrats did not pursue the matter.|$|E
5|$|King {{told the}} International Congress of Coptic Studies {{that the text}} does not prove that Jesus had a wife. She noted that even as a {{translation}} of a 2nd-century AD Greek text, it <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> been written more than 100 years {{after the death of}} Jesus. According to King, the earliest and most reliable information about Jesus is silent on the question of his marital status. King also said that the text (which she suggested is a fragment from a non-canonical gospel) showed that some early Christians believed that Jesus was married. A Harvard News Office article reported that King dated the speculative Greek original to {{the second half of the}} second century because it shows close connections to other newly discovered gospels written at that time, particularly the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Mary, and the Gospel of Philip.|$|E
5|$|The Roman {{military}} occupation {{of a significant}} part of what is now northern Scotland lasted only about 40 years; although their influence on the southern section of the country, occupied by Brythonic tribes such as the Votadini and Damnonii, <b>would</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> been considerable between the first and fifth centuries. The Welsh term Hen Ogledd ("Old North") is used by scholars to describe what is now the North of England and the South of Scotland during its habitation by Brittonic-speaking people around AD 500 to 800. According to writings from the 9th and 10th centuries, the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata was founded in the 6th century in western Scotland. The 'traditional' view is that settlers from Ireland founded the kingdom, bringing Gaelic language and culture with them. However, some archaeologists have argued against this view, saying there is no archaeological or placename evidence for a migration or a takeover by a small group of elites.|$|E
