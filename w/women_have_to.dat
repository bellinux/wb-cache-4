5|$|In {{countries}} where <b>women</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do paid work {{in order to}} feed their family, {{there is a lack}} of regulation and safety standards regarding female workers due to the large amount of informal work available. In Thailand for example, due to the severe economic crisis in 1997, many women have jobs in the informal industry, and often do home-based work so that they can do their domestic jobs concurrently with their paid jobs. This increases the work intensity by women doing more than one job at a time, and has been shown to have deteriorating effects on women's health.|$|E
5|$|In Africa, the HIV/AIDS {{pandemic}} {{has been}} the major cause of falling life expectancy. There is currently a crisis of decreasing number of available care workers for an increasing population requiring care. One reason why this phenomenon occurs is because HIV/AIDS affects working age people the most, {{and there has been}} evidence to show that women are affected at a younger age and in greater numbers. Another reason is due to the influx of HIV/AIDS, government-led health policies are breaking down, increasing the amount of care work and community work that <b>women</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do. Because of the lack of care workers available, the very young and the very old have also started participating in care work, resulting in poorer quality of care.|$|E
25|$|One {{problem that}} <b>women</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> face is that mothers who have young {{children}} and want {{to pursue a career}} may face social criticism. In 2014, the governing coalition agreed to impose a 30% female quota for Supervisory board positions from 2016 onwards.|$|E

25|$|The {{ability of}} women to utilize health care is also heavily {{influenced}} by other forms of structural gender inequalities. These include unequal restriction on one’s mobility and behavior, as well as unequal control over financial resources. Many of these social gender inequalities can impact the way women’s health is regarded, which can in turn determine the level of access <b>women</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> healthcare services and {{the extent by which}} households and the larger community are willing to invest in women’s health issues.|$|E
25|$|The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia {{requires}} Muslim {{women to}} cover their hair and all <b>women</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> wear a full-body garment. Saudi women commonly wear the traditional abaya robe, while foreigners sometimes opt for a long coat. These regulations are enforced by the religious police and vigilantes. In 2002 the Saudi religious police were accused by Saudi and international press of hindering the rescue of schoolgirls from a fire {{because they were not}} wearing hijab, which resulted in 15 deaths.|$|E

She held a lot of conferences and talked about the gender issues. As a woman, she never believed gender schema and always fought for herself. She believed that in the science field, women and men are equal, and that the reason why women are fewer in this field is because women are more easily distracted by other things such as gossip, so <b>women</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> memorize more unrelated things and cannot focus on work.|$|E

25|$|Pregnancy {{for women}} has its hardships. Women lock {{themselves}} {{away in the}} woods inside a hut to keep pregnancy localized, only mothers and grandmothers see the women during labor {{to see how she}} is doing. Pregnant <b>women</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> deal with the pregnancy with the help of other women while the men go along their day like nothing else is happening. They are more pleased with the birth of a girl than that of a boy. The reason being is for the sake of multiplication, in other words, even though women are sent away for their pregnancy, they are given more praise for women being born.|$|E

[...] He added: [...] "People began tweeting the other, harder things <b>women</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> deal with, such as {{institutionalized}} oppression, abuse and sexual assault". James Smith, husband of Moira Smith, the only female New York Police Department officer to die on September 11, 2001, returned Moira's [...] "Woman of the Year" [...] award, given posthumously. Referring to Jenner as a man, he stated that he found Glamour giving Jenner the same award insulting to Moira's memory, and referred to the matter as a publicity stunt. Smith later said that, having supported transgender youth and Glamour decision to honor transgender actress Laverne Cox in 2014, he did not object because Jenner is transgender; he objected to Jenner's [...] "hardest part about being a woman" [...] commentary; this proved to him that Jenner [...] "is not truly a woman. I believe this comment and others he has made trivializes the transgender experience as I have witnessed it." ...|$|E
500|$|Sex {{has also}} become an {{important}} book in the LGBT community. Ben Shapiro, author of Porn Generation: How Social Liberalism Is Corrupting Our Future, wrote that due to its iconic status [...] "Sex adorns the coffee tables of hundreds of gay men and sperm banks". Mark Blankenship, from the LGBT-oriented website New Now Next stated that [...] "literature changed forever" [...] with the publishing of Sex. Madonna's portrayal of lesbian love scenes in the book sparked debates about her own sexual orientation. This was an adjunct to the singer's public relationship with comedian Sandra Bernhard, with whom she cavorted around, visiting lesbian night-clubs as well as partying. The LGBT community felt {{it was an important}} portrayal for them. They debated whether Madonna was [...] "ripping" [...] them off for publicity. As Carolin Grace from Diva magazine noted: [...] "Madonna became meaningful in early nineties, when Sex came out, and at that point lesbian culture was really changing." [...] She noted how women were coming out about their sexuality and the book's handling of the taboo issue were [...] "a legacy, our contribution to the show. The lesbian sub-cultural references borrowed by Madonna aren't our only possessions." [...] O'Brien argues in her book , that the book had a confusing philosophy. According to the female critics, who pointed out the vacuousness of Madonna's remarks about porn and abuse, the singer did not have a correct idea that behind these fantasies the [...] "reality is too hard for her to endure", referring to the daily hustles that <b>women</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> face at red light districts and brothels. The author felt that despite the courageous premise of genuine exploration of queer sex, the book crossed over into pornography and a wrong portrayal for the community, while being flippant and commercial. She drew an example of the death of pornographic actor Joey Stefano, one of the models of the book, from drug overdose. Stefano had been thrilled {{to be a part of}} the book, but was underpaid. Once Madonna and her team were done with the shoot, [...] "they packed up and left the Gaiety... They left behind the mundane reality and the boys who have to deal with it seven days a week." ...|$|E
