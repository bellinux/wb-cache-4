5|$|Several local meteorologists, however, did {{depart from}} the {{official}} predictions of a Tampa Bay landfall {{as early as the}} morning of August 13. Jim Farrell of WINK, Robert Van Winkle WBBH, Steve Jerve of WFLA in Tampa, Jim Reif of WZVN in Fort Myers, and Tom Terry of WFTV in Orlando, all broke with their national news forecasts and stated at around 1500 UTC that Charley <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> early, striking around Charlotte Harbor and traveling over Orlando, as would prove to be the case.|$|E
25|$|In March 1998, he {{returned}} to Crystal Palace {{who had just been}} taken over by Mark Goldberg. Venables left acrimoniously in January 1999, as the south-London club went into administration. His appointment had created a media frenzy, with Goldberg boasting that he <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> Palace into a European force within the next five years. But the dream was over within a year, and Palace narrowly avoided going out of business, although they did at least finish in a secure position in Division One. Venables did lead Crystal Palace into Europe, via the InterToto Cup, but chose to field youth and ultimately the adventure ended immediately as Palace faced an uncertain future after his dealings in the transfer market.|$|E
25|$|In 2009 the FBI {{believed}} that Coppola <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> state's evidence against the Genovese family and {{cooperate with the}} FBI. The FBI {{was willing to give}} him immunity from prosecution and enter him in the Witness Protection Program if he cooperated. The FBI believed he was involved in the killing of Lawrence Ricci (along with his son and stepson) on orders of Tino Fiumara, one of the men the FBI was hoping to prosecute with Coppola's cooperation. Coppola waived a speedy arraignment and spent the next two nights sleeping at FBI headquarters in lower Manhattan at an undisclosed hotel. He also met with a government arranged lawyer known as a shadow counsel. On the third day, however, Coppola refused to cooperate. His defense lawyer Henry Mazurek said that Coppola only dragged out the process out of concern for his wife, who he feared would also be arrested and charged.|$|E

500|$|Forecasters {{predicted}} that Cyclone Percy <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> {{to the southeast}} and hit the islands of Pukapuka [...] and Nassau directly. Because of this, evacuations were ordered and emergency shelters were activated in Rarotonga. Forecasters also {{predicted that}} Percy was going to cause a strong storm surge. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center and NOAA also predicted that the storm was going to strengthen further within 12–24hours. In addition, forecast models predicted that Cyclone Percy would take a similar track like Cyclone Olaf weeks earlier. That prompted officials in the southern Cook Islands to order evacuations.|$|E
500|$|A leading theory among audiences {{was that}} Chloe would {{eventually}} change {{her name to}} Lois Lane, Clark's wife in the comics, as she embodies various characteristics that Lois Lane has in the comic books. The creative team removed the notion that Chloe <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> into Clark's future wife when they introduced Lois Lane in season four. Though the characters share similarities, according to Mack, Chloe and Lois are more [...] "different shades of the same color [...] Chloe is a softer version of Lois". Chloe's upbringing allows her to be less jaded than Lois. Chloe also looks to the future, whereas Lois is more shortsighted.|$|E
500|$|Lytle later noted, [...] "It was {{actually}} Jim 's fault. He {{suggested that we}} consider playing some shows, and I went, 'No', [...] he convinced me {{it might be a}} good idea. We talked about it for a little while. I didn't think anyone else in the band would be into it, [...] he checked around and it turns out they were all enthusiastic. I think I was the last one to say yes.... I {{was actually}} blown away that they even wanted to. Once I found that out, I said 'OK, let's start doing the work, figure out how to play the songs.' The weird moment was when he had the first rehearsal; I had no idea how it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> out. After five days of playing together it actually sounded really good. It was too easy, and we were actually really having a good time together." ...|$|E

500|$|Kennedy {{said that}} during this period, {{with all the}} changes on the team and with players {{returning}} from the war he had to [...] "re-establish myself as an NHLer." [...] Due to Kennedy's poor start to the previous season, there was some talk around this time whether Kennedy <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> {{out to be just}} a [...] "wartime flash in the pan". Many of the players in the NHL during this period failed to stick with their teams once the war ended and the stars returned. However, Kennedy was one of the exceptions and he quickly became one of the team's greatest stars and a favourite of the fans. [...] "Come on, Teeder!" [...] was to become a familiar rallying cry in Maple Leaf Gardens. The cheer, a howl that could be heard throughout the building, was performed by, the otherwise quiet, season ticket-holder John Arnott whenever the Leafs needed a goal.|$|E
2500|$|Ben Kenney {{noted that}} the album's overall {{aesthetic}} revealed itself {{at the end of}} the process: [...] "We were trying to figure out an order for the songs. The sound, the overall feel, I don’t think anybody really had an idea that it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> out the way it did." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the fact, some journalists {{questioned}} why {{or how the}} FBI {{got involved}} at all. Lynch forwarded case details to the Little Rock FBI office, where it was assigned to agent Roy Christopher in Jonesboro. He determined that Lavy was {{an active member of}} the American Legion and had no arrest record, not even a driving violation. Christopher enlisted the help of agent Ivian C. Smith in drawing up a raid plan for the cottage where Lavy lived alone. The agents received day and nighttime aerial photographs from the FBI's Nightstalker aircraft. [...] One FBI official later commented that [...] "FBI headquarters <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> the Lavy arrest and search into a media event." ...|$|E

2500|$|The town of Barrow, Alaska is {{preparing}} for its annual [...] "30 Days of Night", a period during the winter {{when there is a}} month-long polar night. As the town gets ready, a stranger (Ben Foster) rows ashore from a large ship and sabotages the town's communications and transport to the outside world. Barrow's sheriff, Eben Oleson (Josh Hartnett) investigates and also learns that his estranged wife, Stella (Melissa George), missed the last plane and must stay the 30 days. That night, a coven of feral vampires, led by Marlow (Danny Huston), attack and slaughter most of the townspeople, forcing Eben, Stella, Eben's younger brother Jake (Mark Rendall), and several other survivors to take shelter in a boarded-up house with a hidden attic. Marlow finds the stranger locked up in the station. [...] The stranger believed Marlow <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> him into a vampire. Marlow thanks him for doing what he asked, and then snaps his neck. [...] Marlow ironically comments to his fellow vampires: [...] "The things they believe." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well--everything--about Marie, you know. When I {{went over}} to Basle the other day, I didn't think how it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> out. I didn't indeed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I'd known," [...] he said, regretfully, [...] "that {{this guy}} <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> out a ruddy Englishman, I'd {{have taken a}} slap at him with m' stick and chanced it!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'What! Mr. Smith!' {{said she}} {{in a tone}} in which {{tenderness}} and contempt, pity and affected carelessness, were strangely mingled. [...] 'So! you <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> gamekeeper to-night?' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Burnamy," [...] he {{answered}} from within. [...] "He's staying in this house. He {{let me know}} just as I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> him out for the night. It's {{one of those little}} uncandors of his that throw suspicion on his honesty in great things." ...|$|E
