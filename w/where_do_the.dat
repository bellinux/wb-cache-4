2500|$|In {{a review}} of Behe's paper 'Design vs. Randomness in Evolution: <b>Where</b> <b>Do</b> <b>the</b> Data Point?', Denis Lamoureux criticised Darwin's Black Box as having become central to {{fundamentalist}} and evangelical anti-evolution critiques against biological evolution. Behe supports the historically incorrect misrepresentation that Darwin's views {{on the origin of}} life were atheistic, when On the Origin of Species repeatedly refers to a Creator in a positive and supportive context as impressing laws on matter. Though Behe has avoided committing himself to the view that God intervenes directly in nature to create purportedly irreducibly complex structures, Darwin's Black Box briefly speculates that divine intervention might have caused the direct creation of a cell from which all of life evolved, supporting creationist views of miraculous acts of creation, but ironically echoing Darwin's stated [...] "view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one". Behe's claim that the creation of an original first cell represents a [...] "gap" [...] in the laws of nature needing divine intervention appears to be the problematic God of the gaps position which is subject to the gaps being filled by scientific discoveries. Behe's thesis that irreducible structures are created in [...] "one fell swoop" [...] is opposed by other biochemists, including many who are devout Christians, and has no support from the fossil record.|$|E

2500|$|If {{all this}} is true, then <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> world senses come in? The early empiricists all {{stumbled}} over this point. Hume asserted that all knowledge comes from the senses, and then gave away the ballgame by excepting abstract propositions, which he called [...] "relations of ideas". These, he said, were absolutely true (although the mathematicians who thought them up, being human, might get them wrong). Mill, on the other hand, tried to deny that abstract ideas exist outside the physical world: all numbers, he said, [...] "must be numbers of something: {{there are no such}} things as numbers in the abstract". When we count to eight or add five and three we are really counting spoons or bumblebees. [...] "All things possess quantity", he said, so that propositions concerning numbers are propositions concerning [...] "all things whatever". But then in almost a contradiction of himself he went on to acknowledge that numerical and algebraic expressions are not necessarily attached to real world objects: they [...] "do not excite in our minds ideas of any things in particular". Mill's low reputation as a philosopher of logic, and the low estate of empiricism in the century and a half following him, derives from this failed attempt to link abstract thoughts to the physical world, when it may be more plausibly arguable that abstraction consists precisely of separating the thought from its physical foundations.|$|E

6000|$|We {{now look}} into Noack's {{theory of the}} Homeric house. <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> lord and lady sleep?

Thus, {{in the hall of}} Alcinous, the whole space runs from the threshold to the muchos, the innermost part (Odyssey, VII. 87-96). In the hall of Odysseus, the Wooers retreat to the muchos, [...] "the innermost part of the hall" [...] (Odyssey, XXII. 270). [...] "The muchos, in Homer, never denotes a separate chamber."
