40|$|Effective {{lubrication}} of the <b>wheel</b> <b>rail</b> <b>interface</b> {{plays an}} important role in prolonging the life of rail and wheels and can save tens of millions of dollars in maintenance and replacement costs. Condition monitoring and control of wayside rail lubrication equipment is a complex issue and is traditionally undertaken using unskilled labour at great cost. Remote monitoring of wayside rail lubricators reduces the need for staff to attend the sites in person, work in the trackside danger zones, and in remote locations. With many different technologies available at hand, decision making can be a difficult process. Wayside rail lubricators come in many types and theirperformance can vary depending on their configuration, placement, and control. The North American model of rail lubrication greatly differs to that of the models used in Australia. Lubricator blades come in many configurations, performance can greatly vary depending on selection and placement. This paper looks at the application of the different real time monitoring systems offered by the two major suppliers of wayside rail lubricators and the benefits of these systems verses the traditional manual monitoring. For this trial general packet radio service (GPRS) / 3 G technology has been used. The wayside rail lubricators in this trial are in remote locationswith poor access conditions. Data available from the test siteinclude the health of lubricators, grease levels, train movementand security of the unit and parameters relating to grease dispensing. Difficulties encountered, system constraints, andlimitations are discussed for the systems and permit maintenancedecisions to be made prior to leaving the depot. Cost benefits ofemploying such technologies are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Material {{integrity}} and properties of wheels are critical in railway traffic, as wheels fulfil the important function of transferring load and traction from {{the vehicle to}} the rail track. Steels with a pearlitic microstructure are commonly used for wheels due to their height strength, low cost and good wear properties. However, the pearlitic microstructure and behaviour can be altered by thermal and mechanical load being present in the contact between wheel and rail. As very high power is available, a few milliseconds of time where the slip between wheel and rail becomes large can cause small material volumes in the contact to be heated several hundred degrees Celsius. The present work was initiated with the main purpose to investigate the effects of rapid thermal heating and cooling on wheel material. Cyclic and monotonic mechanical testing was performed to {{study the effects of}} thermal softening on virgin wheel material and on used wheels taken out from service. Furthermore, material in both pearlitic and martensitic state was investigated during rapid heating and cooling cycles by methods as laser and resistive heating for different loading conditions. It was shown that alloying composition of different wheel steels could decrease sensitivity to thermal loads, while plastic deformation had the opposite effect when the material was subjected to long time thermal loading. For the typically very short heating times present in the <b>wheel</b> <b>rail</b> <b>interface</b> no significant permanent effects on mechanical properties were measured for pearlitic material. However, for martensitic material, substantial permanent hardness decrease progressed within fractions of a second at elevated temperature. This rapid tempering behaviour was observed to progress even faster in the presence of an external load. Moreover, the inherent different behaviours of pearlite and martensite can result in different residual stress fields for the case of local heating on the tread surface, affected by heating rate, peak temperature and duration. Some additional effects of frictional heating and the influence of wear debris within cracks for rolling contact fatigue cracks were also investigated by use of image and chemical analysis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Derailment {{has always}} been one of the major {{concerns}} for railway. It is a unique challenge for railways to ensure that wheels stay on the rail. Railway technologies have advanced significantly in recent years and safety levels are high compared with the early days and also compared with other transport modes. Derailments however, unfortunately, still frequently occur. The issue of comfort in respect to vibration has become a common question to the railways since vibration plays a major role for ride comfort and ability to perform desk activities. Several factors influence vibration discomfort in relation to passenger activities, e. g. seat design, seated posture, use of backrest, etc. To avoid derailments, railway collect comfort related data from multiple profile trains (i. e. Express, Superfast, passenger’s trains etc) for finding the damage among thousands of tracks when trains travel from one station to another station. In this study we analyzed the received data on the basis of ENV 12299 standard and using Visual Studio 6. 0. MS Access database is used to store the report data. The frequency variations observed during the experiment relate only to the cause of losing lateral control at <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> <b>interface...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{calculation}} of {{temperatures in the}} contact zone at the <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> <b>interface</b> {{is a very complex}} and important issue for multidisciplinary studies. The knowledge of temperature in the contact interface between two bodies and with the possible presence of a third body layer allows making informed judgments on processes in areas such as lubricant choice, wear estimation, life cycle prediction, etc. This paper is focused on the development of a temperature modelling methodology in Gensys multibody code which also presents its implementation for the study of temperatures at various common areas of contact (top of rail, gauge corner and gauge face contacts). Under normal operational practice, all these contact areas have different coefficients of friction which should be characterised as velocity and slip dependant variables. In order to show the workability of the developed methodology, numerical experiments for a heavy haul locomotive equipped with a simplified bogie traction control has been performed on curved track, where a locomotive has been operated under maximum traction forces and with longitudinal and lateral coupler forces attached in order to take into account train dynamics. For these experiments, both new and worn rail profiles have been used. Limitations of the proposed methodology as well as proposed future work and further improvements are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This is a PhD Thesis by {{portfolio}} {{and is the}} output of research, development and the practical application of processes for railway track asset management in the UK between 2004 and 2013 and the subsequent development of innovative solutions. There are two major sections to the portfolio; firstly the background, literature review and development phases; and secondly two specific projects. The projects consisted of major works on the UK West Coast Main Line and targeted schemes involving Eurostar and Humberside. The author is a chartered civil engineer and has spent the whole of his career (32 years) in railway civil engineering mainly in design, maintenance and management and culminating in undergraduate and postgraduate teaching. Railway Infrastructure Life Extension is a specialist area {{that has not been}} studied before in this depth and was initially related to specific problem solving. However, it is now clearly accepted that UK railway privatisation was a success and after passenger journeys increased by 80 % in the period 1996 to 2012, there was substantial strain upon the infrastructure. This portfolio is informed by and considers the current and future challenges faced by railways from a safety, performance and efficiency angle. The study is supported as strategically important work being entirely appropriate and relevant to the industry by the two sponsors, Dr Ilias Oraifige, Senior Academic and Reader at the University of Derby and Ken Mee, Managing Director of Quality and Safety Services Ltd. The term “life extension” was uniquely created and applied to railway infrastructure by the author and his teams during the early phases of this project and became the industry standard phrase for the work involved. The historical background and literature review of the research is included to enable the reader to understand the context of the work undertaken previously where the author acted as the major driver behind the work under industrial conditions commencing in 1997. The author has had a direct involvement in the practical application of the techniques and processes through various senior positions in the UK Rail Industry. The work resulted in testing of equipment in live locations including quantifiable risk assessments and actual benefits to safety, economics and performance. The author held a number of key roles relevant to the study. From 1995 – 2000 he was Regional Director of Balfour Beatty Rail Maintenance and set up the Central Maintenance Group at Sandiacre, Nottinghamshire. This was a team of engineers, supervisors and staff employed to carry out heavy maintenance principally on the Erewash Valley line. From 2000 – 2003 he was Engineering Adviser to the Rail Regulator where he was appointed as the government representative on the Hatfield Recovery Board and sat on various working committees including the <b>Wheel</b> <b>Rail</b> <b>Interface</b> System Authority (WRISA). This was a significant contribution to the recovery of the UK rail system to normal working following the Hatfield Accident. A key contribution during this time was the understanding of the impact of track quality upon asset deterioration. From 2004 – 2007, the author, in his role as General Manager of Carillion Rail Ancillary Projects, was commissioned to set up an organisation to develop and provide innovative and original solutions for life extension and refurbishment of railway track systems in the UK. The principle objective was to build upon previous work done during the final years of the UK contracted-out railway infrastructure maintenance term contracts. The innovations chosen for development were related to delivering economic access to facilitate heavy maintenance and the development of new techniques to extend track life. A number of projects and case studies and their specific solutions are identified and reviewed. Of particular strategic importance is the use of the “Railvac” Swedish ballast removal machine developed in the UK between 2004 and 2012. The culmination of the work is the incorporation of the principles and ideas into the UK National Policy under the ongoing strategy approved by the Office of Rail Regulation for 2014 - 2019. The author has published a number of papers in support of the thesis which have been presented at conferences in London and Spain...|$|E

40|$|<b>Rail</b> and <b>wheel</b> wear {{are major}} {{components}} of operating costs with all rail operators and infrastructure owners. Wayside lubrication methods {{are used to}} apply grease to the gauge corner of the rails where it is picked up by train wheels passing through the lubricator site. Different methods and placement locations are currently being used in different rail networks to lubricate <b>rail</b> and <b>wheel.</b> Field investigations show that in many curves effective lubrication ends up within a few meters of wayside lubricator sites. <b>Rail</b> <b>wheel</b> maintenance and replacement costs are huge in most heavy haul networks. Change in placement location, equipment, quality of grease and <b>rail</b> <b>wheel</b> conditions influence the grease carry distance.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} fatigue related {{issues in the}} field of railway mechanics. In {{particular}} rail breaks and deterioration of insulating joints are investigated. The study is largely motivated by plans to increase allowed axle loads in Sweden. The aim is to deliver operational results, as well as exemplify how practical problems in railway mechanics can be assessed by computer based simulations. In the first appended paper the influence of wheel flat impacts on the growth of rail cracks and subsequent rail breaks is analyzed. This calls for an analysis of the dynamic train [...] track interaction combined with a fracture mechanics analysis of crack growth and fracture. To account for high frequency excitations due to wheel flat impacts the in-house code DIFF is employed for the analysis of train [...] track interaction. Stress intensity factors for rail cracks are derived using FE-simulations. Added loading due to restricted thermal contraction of all-welded rails is included. Risks of rail breaks for specified crack sizes and temperatures are evaluated as functions of impact load magnitudes. In addition crack growth rates are quantified. Simulation results indicate that wheel flats increase the risk of rail breaks, but have a limited influence on rack growth rates. The latter is due to the infrequent occurrence of wheel flats and the fact that these need to impact in a rather narrow region to cause any considerable influence on the crack growth rate. In the second paper deterioration of insulated joints is analyzed by 3 D FE-simulations. Repeated negotiations of a loaded wheel over an insulating joint is simulated. To obtain realistic material responses, an advanced constitutive model is employed. The simulations indicate the accumulated strain (ratcheting) to be the dominant damage mechanism. In a parametric study the influence of insulating gap, axel load, frictional force, and coefficient of maximum friction in the <b>wheel</b> [...] <b>rail</b> <b>interface</b> is assessed. In particular the frictional force (traction/braking) is found to have a major influence on joint deterioration. A limited field study has been carried out and provided some qualitative confirmation of the simulations...|$|R

40|$|Numerical {{procedures}} for reliable <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> wear prediction are rare. Recent development of simulation techniques and computer power together with tribological knowledge do however suggest computer aided wear prediction as possible. The present {{objective is to}} devise a numerical procedure able to simulate profile evolution due to uniform wear sufficiently accurate for application to vehicle dynamics simulation. Such a tool should be useful for maintenance planning, optimisation of the railway system and its components as well as trouble-shooting. More specifically, the field of application may include estimation of reprofiling frequency, optimisation of <b>wheel</b> – <b>rail</b> profile match, optimisation of running gear suspension parameters, and recognition of unfavourable profile evolution influencing the dynamic response of the vehicle. The research contribution accounted for in this thesis includes, besides a literature review, modelling of the <b>wheel</b> – <b>rail</b> <b>interface,</b> benchmarking against traditional methods, and validation with respect to full-scale measurements. The first part addresses <b>wheel</b> – <b>rail</b> contact conditions {{in the context of}} wear simulation as well as tribological environment and tractive forces. The current approach includes Archard’s wear model with associated wear maps, vehicle dynamics simulation, and railway network definition. One objective {{is to be able to}} include variations in operation conditions in the set of simulations instead of using scaling factors. In particular the influence of disc braking and varying lubrication conditions have been investigated. Both environmental factors like moist and contamination and deliberate lubrication need to be considered. As part of the associated contact analysis the influence of tangential elastic deformation of the contacting surfaces has been investigated and found to be essential in case of partial slip contact conditions. The influence on the calculated wear of replacing the Hertzian contact by a non-elliptic semi-Hertzian method has been investigated, showing relocation of material loss towards increased profile curvature. In the second part comparisons have been carried out with traditional methods, where the material loss is assumed to be directly related to the energy dissipated in the contact. Attention has been paid to the understanding of the principle differences between the investigated methods, comparing the distribution of friction energy, sliding velocity, and wear depth. As a prerequisite, contact conditions with dependence on wheelset guidance and curving performance as well as influence of tractive forces have been investigated. In the final part validation of the developments related to wheel wear simulation is addressed. Disc braking has been included and a wear map for moist contact conditions based on recent tests has been drafted. Good agreement with measurements from the reference operation, is achieved. Further a procedure for simulation of rail wear and corresponding profile evolution has been formulated. A simulation set is selected defining the vehicles running on the track to be investigated, their operating conditions, and contact parameters. Trial calculations of a few curves show qualitatively good results in terms of profile shape development and difference in wear mechanisms between gauge corner and rail head. The wear rates related to traffic tonnage are however overestimated. The impact of the model improvements accounted for in the first part of the thesis has been investigated, indicating directions for further development. QC 2011012...|$|R

Accurate prediction of this wear can improve economy, ride comfort, prevention of derailment and planning of maintenance interventions.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the thesis has been to extend the capabilities for computational modeling, prediction and simulation of the elastic response of the train, track structure and soil in railway systems. The industrial background is {{the high level of}} ground borne vibrations reported from citizens as a consequence of train traffic (in particular from high speed trains) in several Swedish locations. Computational analysis is a tool for enhanced understanding of the governing phenomena, preliminary tests of different countermeasures and for visualization of the behaviour of the system. An advanced application encompassing finite element analysis, a large variety of solvers for large systems of equations and generation of output for graphical visualisaton was developed prior to this project. During the course of the work described in this thesis, it has been enhanced by three main features: The integration of three-dimensional rigid body dynamics with finite elements for analysis of vehicle / solid interaction problems The insertion of a fictitious layer of viscoelastic elements of a viscoelastic material to reduce unphysical reflections in the solution Moving mesh calculations allowing for analysis over long distances The outcome is an advanced application for vehicle – solid interaction problems over long distances. The inclusion of rigid body equations incorporates the dynamic behaviour of the train components, allows for tests of various passive or semi active suspension strategies and makes it possible to analyse the results in the carbody, bogies and <b>wheels.</b> <b>Wheel</b> – <b>rail</b> <b>interface</b> modelling accounts for contact stiffness theory and opens up for simulations of the effect of various types of imperfections. Usage of a moving mesh extends the capacity to selectively relocate a predefined mesh so that the track / ground geometries and track design can be modified {{as a function of the}} traveled distance. The high level of detail leads to a system with many degrees of freedom. It is of great importance to consider the relationship between the range of problems that can be solved, the computational resources and efficiency of the numerical procedures and the chosen model. This is one of the main themes of the appended articles. Simulations of real world problems confirm that passage at certain critical train speeds leads to strongly magnified vibrations in the track and soil. In another study, mitigation techniques show that lime cement columns can provide very good protection against ground borne vibrations. Finally, it has been shown that rail head irregularities beyond allowed levels can induce vibrations threatening the comfort of the people in the coach...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, wheel/rail {{interface}} optimisation, {{and particularly}} the problems of <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> profile design are considered. The research task pursued by this thesis engenders investigation {{of a range of}} problems. First, geometric properties of contact between <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> are investigated. Then, physical properties of rolling contact between <b>wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> are studied with the help of contact mechanics. Railway vehicle dynamics are then considered using multibody dynamic approach. Finally, a numerical optimisation method is used for the design of the wheel profile. All these disciplines are combined in one <b>wheel</b> (<b>rail)</b> profile design procedure. The <b>wheel</b> (<b>rail)</b> profile design procedure is developed with the idea that the rolling radius difference (RRD) function, to a large extent, describes the wheel/rail contact properties. Therefore, for a known optimal RRD function, a wheel profile that delivers the required contact properties defined by this RRD can be determined. <b>Wheel</b> and <b>rail</b> profile measurements are used to analyse wheelset contact properties in order to design the target RRD function. The problem of finding a wheel profile corresponding to the target RRD function is formulated as an optimisation problem. The dynamic performance of a vehicle with the designed wheel profile is tested for stability, wear, and dynamic contact stresses using the ADAMS/Rail computer package. In this research, three railway system types are considered - tram, metro, and conventional railway. Using the developed design procedure, new wheel profiles are designed for each above mentioned case, solving for, respectively, the problems of flange wear, stability (as a result of excessive tread wear), and RCF. In the first two cases, wheel profiles were successfully implemented on the respective networks. Successful application of the design procedure to real-life problems has proven its usability and expediency. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
