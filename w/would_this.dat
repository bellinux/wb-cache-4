5|$|The brigade's next {{operation}} {{was scheduled for}} early September 1944. Codenamed Comet, the plan called for the 1st Airborne Division's three brigades to land in the Netherlands and capture three river crossings. The first of these was the bridge over the River Waal at Nijmegen, the second the bridge over the River Maas at Grave and finally the River Rhine at Arnhem. The objective of the 4th Parachute Brigade would be the bridge at Grave. Planning for Comet was well advanced when on the 10September the mission was cancelled. Instead, a new operation, Market Garden, was proposed whose objectives {{were the same as}} those of Comet but <b>would</b> <b>this</b> time be carried out by three divisions of the 1st Allied Airborne Army.|$|E
5|$|The production’s incredible. The beat {{is just so}} {{constant}} and powerful. That was the first song that I wrote with Dimitri and Maya. I felt like I’d found my sound. And I was kind {{of looking at it}} like an outfit. So it was, ‘if this was an outfit, what <b>would</b> <b>this</b> song need now?’ So we had the pretty dress, which was the chorus. We had the lovely shoes, which was the verse. ‘But what do we need to really set this song off? A big, fancy, bow in the hair would really set this song off.’ So when I got to the middle eight I wanted to go really erratic, almost like taTu on All The Things She Said. I wanted it to be proper fucked up and crazy – hands in the air.|$|E
5|$|The {{largest and}} most {{influential}} recording label of the time, The Victor Talking Machine (RCA Victor after 1928) was a restraining influence {{on the development of}} “sweet jazz” until the departure of Eddie King in October 1926. King was well known as an authoritarian who would not permit drinking on the job or severe departure from the written music, unless within solos acceptable by popular music standards of the time. This irritated many Victor jazz artists, including famed trumpeter Bix Beiderbecke. Sudhalter, in Lost Chords, cites an example of a 1927 recording by the Goldkette Orchestra in which musicians were allowed considerable freedom, and remarks “What, one wonders, <b>would</b> <b>this</b> performance have been if Eddie King had been in charge, and not the more liberal Nat Shilkret. Since the Victor ledgers show no less than five recording sessions in January and February 1926, when King actually conducted Goldkette’s Orchestra, comparison between the approach of Goldkette and King is readily available.|$|E

25|$|In some cases, the {{modified}} properties of copolymer are more desirable {{for a particular}} application. For example, cyclohexane dimethanol (CHDM) {{can be added to}} the polymer backbone in place of ethylene glycol. Since this building block is much larger (6 additional carbon atoms) than the ethylene glycol unit it replaces, it does not fit in with the neighboring chains the way an ethylene glycol unit <b>would.</b> <b>This</b> interferes with crystallization and lowers the polymer's melting temperature. In general, such PET is known as PETG or PET-G (Polyethylene terephthalate glycol-modified; Eastman Chemical, SK Chemicals, and Artenius Italia are some PETG manufacturers). PETG is a clear amorphous thermoplastic that can be injection molded or sheet extruded. It can be colored during processing.|$|E

25|$|People began petitioning the King {{for relief}} against unfair judgments, {{and as the}} number of petitioners rapidly grew, so the King {{delegated}} the task of hearing petitions to the Lord Chancellor. As the early Chancellors lacked formal legal training and showed little regard for precedent, their decisions were often widely diverse. In 1529, a lawyer, Sir Thomas More, was appointed as Chancellor, marking {{the beginning of a new}} era. After this time, all future Chancellors were lawyers. Beginning around 1557, records of proceedings in the Courts of Chancery were kept and several equitable doctrines developed. Criticisms continued, the most famous being 17th-century jurist John Selden's aphorism:Equity is a roguish thing: for law we have a measure, know what to trust to; equity is according to the conscience of him that is Chancellor, and as that is larger or narrower, so is equity. 'Tis all one as if they should make the standard for the measure we call a foot, a Chancellor's foot; what an uncertain measure <b>would</b> <b>this</b> be? One Chancellor has a long foot, another a short foot, a third an indifferent foot: 'tis the same thing in a Chancellor's conscience.|$|E
500|$|Process {{theology}} typically stresses God's relational nature. Rather {{than seeing}} God as impassive or emotionless, process theologians view God as [...] "the fellow sufferer who understands", {{and as the}} being who is supremely affected by temporal events. [...] Hartshorne points out that people would not praise a human ruler who was unaffected by either the joys or sorrows of his followers – so why <b>would</b> <b>this</b> be a praise-worthy quality in God? [...] Instead, as the being who is most affected by the world, God is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world. [...] However, process theology has been formulated {{in a wide variety}} of ways. [...] C. Robert Mesle, for instance, advocates a [...] "process naturalism", i.e. a process theology without God.|$|E
500|$|... "Trevor" [...] was co-written by Ken Hawryliw and Jim Guttridge. Hawryliw {{had been}} The X-Files {{property}} master from 1993 to 1998 while {{the show was}} filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia. Over the years, he had written several scripts but had never submitted them to The X-Files writing staff. Eventually, {{he moved on to}} work on Millennium, where he developed a friendship with Guttridge. Guttridge showed Hawryliw a script he had been writing that he wanted to submit for The X-Files. Although the story was not written like an X-Files script, Hawryliw enjoyed the premise. The two decided to form a partnership: Guttridge would craft the basic story and script and Hawryliw would help to craft it into an X-Files script. Hawryliw later explained that the idea to make Pinker search out his son: [...] "There's this unique man who can walk through walls. Now, who <b>would</b> <b>this</b> ability best apply to? Well, a convict obviously—a guy in prison. But then we had to give him an even stronger, more compelling reason to want his freedom, and that was where his son came from".|$|E

500|$|The Austrian {{failure to}} hold Kehl and the Strasbourg {{crossing}} in September 1796 gave Moreau {{some measure of}} security in his actions in the Black Forest and the southern flood plain of the Rhine. If the Austrians had held the crossing, General Petrasch's entire corps could have fallen upon the French army, at that time debouching through the Black Forest defiles and congregating in Freiburg. [...] With sufficient forces, Petrasch also could have advanced as far as Hüningen and carried its tete de point, which had fewer defenders than Kehl. Not only <b>would</b> <b>this</b> embarrass the French who had, up to that point, maintained a steady and secure retreat westward out of southern Germany, it would trap the French army in Germany between Petrasch and the approaching Archduke Charles. As it was, when Petrasch could not actually effect capture of the crossing, {{he was forced to}} remain outside Kehl, holding the approaches to the village. Despite the limited success of Petrarsch's action, it had a broad impact on the movements of the main armies of Moreau and Archduke Charles. By preventing French access to the Kehl/Strasbourg crossing, Petrasch forced Moreau to move south; any retreat into France must happen via the bridges at Hüningen.|$|E
500|$|Buffy's {{numbers are}} the most complex, {{changing}} key and tempo when she begins to reveal the secrets she swore she never <b>would.</b> <b>This</b> appears specifically in [...] "Something to Sing About", which starts with uptempo platitudes: [...] "We'll sing a happy song / And you can sing along: / Where there's life, there's hope / Every day's a gift / Wishes can come true / Whistle while you work..." [...] While singing, she kills Sweet's minions with a pool cue. Whedon attempted to make the song tuneful yet chaotic to express the main point of the episode. It transitions suddenly into her desire to be like normal girls, then changes again, slowing the tempo as she challenges Sweet not {{to give her a}} song, but [...] "something to sing about". Musicologist Amy Bauer categorizes the tempo shifts as [...] "rock ballad to punk polka to hymn" [...] that indicates Buffy's turmoil. The key and tempo slow again, as Buffy finally reveals [...] "I live in hell / 'Cause I've been expelled from heaven / I think I was in heaven" [...] with the chord changing from B minor to B diminished, each time she repeats [...] "heaven". When replying to her, Spike has the same shift from minor to diminished each time he repeats the word [...] "living." ...|$|E
