After sometime, Olomu Aperan {{consulted}} Ifa oracle, his chief priest was Famuwagun and it was revealed through Ifa divination that Oyo-Ile would disintegrate therefore, Ifa warned that he should proceed to a new settlement and that wherever he found a plant called Oro Agogo (botanical bell cactus) was his safe place and there he should settle. Hence, Olomu Aperan piloted his way with Ogbo cutlass in his care to his present settlement Omupo where Oro Agogo was found. Some of his families are left behind at Oyo till the present time while some others left for other locations in Yoruba land. While Olomu was leaving Ile-Ife, he cut a branch of Omo tree as a souvenir and he used it as <b>working</b> <b>stick.</b> He passed the <b>working</b> <b>stick</b> on to his male child called Kujenrola the only child that survived him who planted it at Omupo which made him {{to be known as}} Alomoole.|$|E

2500|$|Anguish {{over the}} death of his son of scarlet fever in September 1860 pushed Huxley to the brink, from which Kingsley rescued him by a series of letters. Huxley put his fury {{over the death}} into {{composing}} a paper which violently assaulted Owen's ideas and professional reputation. It was published in January 1861 in the first issue of Huxley's relaunched Natural History Review magazine, and presented citations, quotations and letters from leading anatomists to attack Owen's three claims, aiming to prove him [...] "guilty of wilful and deliberate falsehood" [...] by citing Owen himself, and (with less clear cut justification) the anatomists whose illustrations Owen had used in the 1857 paper. While readily agreeing that the human brain differed from that of apes in size, proportions and complexity of convolutions, Huxley played the significance of these features down, and argued that to a lesser extent these also differed between the [...] "highest" [...] and [...] "lowest" [...] human races. Darwin congratulated Huxley on this [...] "smasher" [...] against the [...] "canting humbug" [...] Owen. From February to May Huxley delivered a very popular series of sixpenny lectures for working men at the School of Mines where he taught, on [...] "The Relation of Man to the Rest of the Animal Kingdom". He told his wife that [...] "My <b>working</b> men <b>stick</b> by me wonderfully, the house being fuller than ever last night.

6000|$|One person {{works the}} [...] "drill-stick" [...] with a rude bow, {{and with his}} other hand holds a piece of stone or of wood above it, both to steady it and to give the {{requisite}} pressure--gentle at first, and increasing judiciously up to the critical moment when the fire is on the point of bursting out. Another man puts his hands on the lower piece of wood, the [...] "fire-block," [...] to steady it, and holds a piece of tinder ready to light it as soon as fire is produced. If a serious emergency should occur, {{it is by no means}} hopeless to obtain fire after this method. A large party have considerable advantages over only one or two men, because as the work is fatiguing, the men can undertake it in turns; and, again, as considerable knack is required for success, it is much more probable that one man out of many should succeed, than that only one man, taken at hazard, should do so. But the best plan of all for a party of three or more men is for one of them to hold the upper block, another to hold the lower block and the tinder, should there be any, and the third man to cause the drill-stick to rotate. He will effect this best by dispensing with the [...] "bow," [...] and by simply using a string or thong of a yard or four feet long. He makes one or two turns with the string round the drill-stick, and then holding one end of the string in either hand, he saws away with all his force. I believe that a party of three men, furnished with dry wood of an appropriate quality and plenty of string, would surely produce smoke on the first few trials, but that they would fail in producing fire. If, however, they had a couple of hours' leisure to master the knack of <b>working</b> these <b>sticks,</b> I think they would succeed in producing fire before the end of that time. The period of time necessary for a successful operation is from one to three minutes. It is of little use fatiguing yourself with sustaining the exertion for a longer period at a time, unless the wood becomes continuously hotter. As soon as the temperature remains uniform it shows that you have let the opportunity slip; it is then the best economy of effort to desist at once, to rest, to take breath, and recommence with fresh vigour.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis was to discover highly efficient, cost effective and environmental friendly electrode material {{for the detection of}} Ruthenium Tris Bypiridil (Ru(bpy) 32 +) using ElectroChemiLuminescence (ECL) technique. In this regard different novel materials, Carbon NanoTubes (CNT), Bismuth oxide (Bi 2 O 3), Bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl), Bi 2 O 3 /CNT composite, BiOCl/CNT composite, Carbon Fiber (CF), Silicon Carbide (SiC) and Biomass material, have been utilized as a working electrode (WE) in the ECL analysis. Throughout the ECL experiments, gold (Au) were used as an auxiliary electrode and silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) were used as a reference electrode. Concerning CNT working electrode, self-standing cylindrical-shaped Multi-Walled Carbon NanoTubes (MWCNT) were grown by means of chemical vapour deposition (CVD) system. The bundles were initially back contacted with copper wire and then encapsulated into epoxy resin to provide electrical insulation. During the measurements, it was observed that emission of light is periodic and it last for hundreds of voltammetric cycles. The efficiency was found out to be far better than commercially used Glassy Carbon (GC) working electrode, used as a benchmark. The only problem with CNT was the non-reproducibility which we don't have in case of GC. The analysis showed that, even they are not cost-effective and environmental friendly; they are highly efficient and can be considered as disposable electrode material for ECL based biosensor platforms. On the other hand, different bismuth based materials were investigated as a WE in ECL experiments. Initially, Bi 2 O 3, BiOCl and their composite with CNT were used to make different kind of pellets and then the process of electrical connection and encapsulation was performed. The ECL analysis showed {{that it is possible to}} have light emission with all bismuth based working electrodes but with lower intensities. Bismuth is considered to be cheap and less toxic then glassy carbon but the efficiency of bismuth based electrodes were found out to be lesser than glassy carbon. CF is now reached to a maturity level and they represent a growing industry with multitude of applications. Due to large surface area and high electrical conductivity, CF is widely used as electrode material for various applications. In order to exploit these properties, CF was also used as WE for ECL analysis. During the analysis, it has been noticed that the light emission were almost constant with very low deviation. The light emission with CF electrode was found to be even better than the standard glassy carbon electrode (GCE) used as benchmark. Sensitivity, bio-compatibility and low cost are the main characteristics which make CF a potential candidate for the future biosensor platforms. The superior bio-electric properties of SiC make it an ideal candidate for bio-electrodes. The SiC is considered to be one of the most favourable bio-compatible materials due to its hydrophilicity and rich surface chemistry. In this work three different kinds of SiC material; (1) SiC with SiO 2 shell (2) SiC without SiO 2 shell (3) SiC thin film, were used as working electrodes. The light emission with all these electrodes was found to be quite strong and stable in time. Biomass, are considered to be one of the best resources for the production of cost-effective and environmental friendly products. These solid wastes have the peculiarity of producing low ash and high carbon contents through the process of pyrolyzation and activation. In this work we have used Bamboo and Pistachio Nut Shells (PNS), two biomass materials, as a precursor for making <b>working</b> electrodes. Bamboo <b>sticks</b> were initially pyrolyzed, using metal oxide chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD) system. This work was carried out in order to prove the possibility of using less expensive carbon based electrodes for ECL analysis. It has also been showed the possibility of making electrodes through biomass materials. Initially bamboo was pyrolyzed in an argon fluxed oven at 850 °C. In order to attain a high amount of purity, the surface of the resulted pyrolysed bamboo sticks were cleaned with an acid attack. The purity was later confirmed by XPS and TGA analysis. The experimental analysis showed that the bamboo electrodes have outstanding electrochemical properties than standard GC electrodes, even if they are lacking good reproducibility. The tubular structure of bamboo was found to be a vital factor for such higher ECL emissions and stability. In order to use PNS as working electrode in ECL experiments, initially, it was carbonized at 500 °C for 2 hours by using Chemical Vapour Deposition (CVD) apparatus. Consequently, the Carbonized Pistachio Nut Shells (CPNS) were activated with KOH at 900 °C in Argon atmosphere. Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) analysis confirmed the grain size, structural porosity, activation with KOH and elemental composition. The experimental analysis showed that the ECL efficiency and stability with CNPS electrodes are comparable with GC electrodes but like bamboo they are also lacking good reproducibility. The very low cost of the raw material combined with such good results make them good candidates for future ECL based disposable biosensor platform...|$|R
