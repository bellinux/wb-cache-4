5|$|At the time, the Hollywood {{characters}} Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto {{were popular}} in the Indies, as were imported detective films in general; however, no films in that genre had yet been produced domestically. This led Jo to make a detective film which he thought would be successful <b>with</b> <b>ethnic</b> Chinese audiences. For this, he approached L.V. Wijnhamer, Jr., an Indo man who was popular within the ethnic Chinese community for his social work; Wijnhamer, better known as Pah Wongso, helped educate abandoned children, ran an employment office, and raised funds for Red Cross aid in war-torn China. Wijnhamer accepted the role.|$|E
5|$|In 1839, the City of Galveston {{adopted a}} charter and was {{incorporated}} by the Congress of the Republic of Texas. The city was by then a burgeoning {{port of entry}} and attracted many new residents in the 1840s and later among the flood of German immigrants to Texas, including Jewish merchants. Together <b>with</b> <b>ethnic</b> Mexican residents, these groups tended to oppose slavery, support the Union during the Civil War, and join the Republican Party after the war.|$|E

5|$|Si Ronda {{was adapted}} from a lenong (a Betawi oral {{tradition}} similar to a stage play) popular <b>with</b> <b>ethnic</b> Chinese and native audiences of the time. The Ronda stories follow the Betawi bandit of the same name, who is skilled at silat (traditional martial arts) and reputed to take from the rich {{to give to the}} poor. The Indonesian film scholar Misbach Yusa Biran suggests that Ronda was selected for adaptation because of its potential action sequences. In the domestic cinema, such sequences had generally been inspired by American works and been well received by audiences.|$|E
5|$|Although the Quiriguá elite {{were clearly}} Maya in ethnicity, the site {{lies on the}} {{southern}} periphery of the Mesoamerican area and the population was at least bi-ethnic, <b>with</b> <b>ethnic</b> Maya in a minority. The {{majority of the population}} belonged ethnically to the less complex Intermediate Area lying beyond the eastern border of Mesoamerica. The population density of the site has been estimated at 400 to 500 per square kilometer (1040 to 1300 per square mile) in the centre of the city during the Late Classic with an estimated peak population of 12001600; surveys have revealed an average of 130 structures per square kilometer (338 per square mile) at the site, compared with 1449 structures/km2 (3767 per square mile) in central Copán. The low population density indicates that Quiriguá served as the focus for a dispersed rural population.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{economic}} activity, permanent {{settlement of the}} peninsula did not intensify until the 1860s and even then it remained sporadic until 1917. The population of Kola in 1880, for example, was only around 500inhabitants living in 80households, compared to 1,900inhabitants in 300households living there in 1582. Transportation facilities were virtually non-existent and the communication {{with the rest of}} Russia irregular. 1887 saw an influx of Izhma Komi and Nenets people who were migrating to the peninsula to escape a reindeer disease epidemic in their home lands and brought their large deer herds with them, resulting in increased competition for the grazing lands, a conflict between the Komi and the Sami, and in marginalization of the local Sami population. By the end of the 19th century, the Sami population had mostly been forced north, <b>with</b> <b>ethnic</b> Russians settling in the south of the peninsula.|$|E

5|$|Since Sri Lanka gained {{independence}} from Britain in 1948, {{relations between the}} majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil communities have been strained. Rising ethnic and political tensions, along <b>with</b> <b>ethnic</b> riots in 1956, 1958, 1977, 1981 and 1983, {{led to the formation}} and strengthening of militant groups advocating independence for Tamils. The ensuing civil war resulted in the deaths of more than 100,000people and the forced disappearance of thousands of others. The civil war ended in 2009 but there are continuing allegations of atrocities being committed by the Sri Lankan Military and the rebel Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam during its final months. A United Nations panel found that as many as 40,000 civilians may {{have been killed in the}} final months of the civil war. The end of the civil war has not improved conditions in Sri Lanka, with press freedom not being restored and judiciary coming under political control.|$|E
5|$|Through his {{paternal}} family, Filitti {{descended from}} historical figures whose careers were {{intertwined with the}} history of Wallachia, the Romanian subregion and former autonomous state. It originated <b>with</b> <b>ethnic</b> Greek migrants from the Epirus—where the Filitti family was known to be residing in the 17th century. The main settlers were male monks, whose presence was attested in Buzău County around 1786: rising through the ranks of the Romanian Orthodox Church, Dositei Filitti served as Wallachian Metropolitan Bishop, assigning nephew Constandie to preside over the Diocese of Buzău. Although his Epirote father was a noted Russophile, the Metropolitan regarded himself as a liberal-minded Wallachian patriot: he founded the local school of divinity, provided scholarships to young Wallachians, and sponsored the growing printing industry. In tandem, he spoke out against the practice of slavery, protecting Romani women from their Wallachian masters and donating money for the release of devșirme victims. During times of turmoil, when Wallachia effectively became a dominion of the Russian Empire, Dositei was swiftly deposed on Russian orders.|$|E
