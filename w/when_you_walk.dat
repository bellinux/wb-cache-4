2500|$|Then verse 7 goes on {{to remind}} the {{community}} to remember all the commandments and to [...] "teach them diligently to your children and speak of them {{when you sit down}} and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk,</b> when you lie down and when you rise", to recite the words of God when retiring or rising; to bind those words [...] "on thy arm and thy head" [...] (classically Jewish oral tradition interprets as tefillin), and to [...] "inscribe them on the door-posts of your house and on your gates" [...] (referring to mezuzah).|$|E
2500|$|The Gospel of Luke notes that, as a child, Jesus was obedient to his earthly parents. For a {{child in}} the home, the commandment to honour parents is comprehensive, {{excluding}} immoral actions. Grown children, while not obligated to obedience in the same way, should continue to afford respect for parental wishes, advice and teaching. [...] "Filial respect is shown by true docility and obedience. 'My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching. ... <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk,</b> they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you...'" [...] (Proverbs 6:20–22) ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Yes, and a fat old {{cockchafer}} hitting {{you in the}} eye <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> home. Smell of hay, and a moon as big as a bandbox {{sitting on}} the top of a haycock; bats,--roses,--milk and midges,' said Lowndes.|$|R
6000|$|Deane {{shook his}} head. [...] "My dear young lady," [...] he said, [...] "you were more in your element <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> bareheaded upon {{the sands of}} Rakney, and saved me from a wetting, than in your present pose." ...|$|R
2500|$|On being wealthy, he {{said that}} [...] "if people know you're rich, they don't talk with you <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> down the street." [...] He kept his wealth an open secret, {{amassing}} media outlets, hotels and casinos with a net worth widely estimated at {{more than a billion}} dollars. Griffin stated he did not really know his worth because it [...] "would keep me from sleeping at night". Former First Lady Nancy Reagan and he exchanged birthday greetings each July 6 for their shared birthday. Griffin was also an honorary pallbearer at the funeral of President Ronald Reagan in 2004, having been friends with both of the Reagans for many years.|$|E
2500|$|Sean Watkins {{began his}} tenure with Nickel Creek playing mandolin, but later {{switched}} to guitar. The band has released three albums and a CD composed of their hits (called Reasons Why: The Very Best) {{and won a}} Grammy for This Side – a coveted trophy that Watkins reportedly put {{on top of his}} toilet at home. Explaining the somewhat odd situation, Watkins said that [...] "it seems like a humble place. I didn't want to put it out in plain view of my house. I didn't feel like displaying it right <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> in. It's a nice crown for the porcelain." [...] In addition to playing with Nickel Creek, Watkins has released 4 solo albums.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the sixth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Moses {{imparted}} God's instructions, the Shema and V'ahavta, saying: [...] "Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God {{with all your}} heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might. And these words, which I command you this day, shall be upon your heart; and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> by the way, and when you lie down, and when thou rise up. And you shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes. And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house, and upon your gates." [...] A closed portion ( [...] , setumah) ends here.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{only mean}} what you mean," [...] {{answered}} the unknown in a temperate voice. [...] "What {{was it that}} you always meant on those million and one nights <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> outside your Ludgate Hill shop and shook your hand in the air?" ...|$|R
5000|$|... 1949 to 1952 — After {{graduating from}} MIT, Howlett {{supported}} himself {{and a wife}} and daughter by creating his first enterprise, repairing TV sets in the home, and by designing and building electronic prototypes—one of which had a proximity detector that caused a dummy {{to talk to you}} in a store <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> up to it.|$|R
6000|$|... "A word of {{kindness}}! Well; {{what shall}} I say? Every night, as I have lain in my bed, I have said words of kindness to you, since--since--since {{longer than you}} will remember; since I first knew you as a child.

2500|$|Of {{his initial}} meeting with President Bush {{regarding}} the surge, Keane said {{he made a}} phone call to Newt Gingrich to ask his advice prior to the meeting. As Keane said in 2014, Gingrich gave me some good advice. He said, [...] "Look, Jack. Most people go in the Oval Office, even people who go in there a lot, have a tendency in front of the President of the United States to always leave something on the table." [...] He said, [...] "Don’t leave anything on the table." [...] He said, [...] "You’re going to get about 15 minutes at best and put it all out there. And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> out of that room, feel good that you got it all out there." [...] So that was sound advice, and I did put it all out there.|$|E
2500|$|DeShannon {{continued}} to record into the 21st century. She released You Know Me, {{an album of}} original songs, for Varèse Sarabande in 2000, and <b>When</b> <b>You</b> <b>Walk</b> In The Room, a new recording of her best-known songs, in 2011. She was portrayed by singer Liz Phair in an episode of American Dreams. On June 17, 2010, DeShannon {{was inducted into the}} Songwriters Hall of Fame.

2500|$|Your {{walking tour}} of Arrakis must include this {{approach}} across the dunes to the Grand Palace at Arrakeen. From a distance, {{the dimensions of}} this construction are deceptive [...] The largest man-made structure ever built, the Grand Palace could cover more than ten of the Imperium's most populous cities under one roof, a fact that becomes more apparent when you learn Atreides attendants and their families, housed spaciously in the Palace Annex, number some thirty-five million souls [...] <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> into the Grand Reception Hall of the Palace at Arrakeen, be prepared to feel dwarfed before an immensity never before conceived. A statue of St. Alia Atreides, shown as [...] "The Soother of Pains," [...] stands twenty-two meters tall but {{is one of the}} smallest adornments in the hall. Two hundred such statues could be stacked one atop the other against the entrance pillars and still fall short of the doorway's capitol arch, which itself is almost a thousand meters below the first beams upholding the lower roof.|$|E
50|$|There were {{no visible}} phone lines or power lines, {{as they were}} all buried in the Canal Zone (with very rare exception). Small square white {{buildings}} hid the electrical transformers in the neighborhood, and one could hear them buzz <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> by them. A transformer house {{can be seen on}} the left in the linked picture of Gamboa's Swimming Pool.|$|R
5000|$|The downstairs {{contains}} the furnishings {{of a typical}} family house of the time, with displays of clothing and other period artifacts. [...] "We {{just wanted you to}} feel like home <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> in and then go explore the museum part upstairs," [...] Haddock told Alexandria Daily Town Talk. The facility is handicapped-accessible with an elevator. A state grant of $65,000 helped fund restoration.|$|R
6000|$|... "You have a rare {{accomplishment}} for an Englishwoman," [...] he resumed--"you walk well. She walked well. I couldn't {{resist the}} temptation of seeing her again, in seeing you. It was her movement, her sweet, simple, unsought grace (not yours), <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> {{to the end of}} the room and returned to me. You raised her from the dead <b>when</b> <b>you</b> fetched the chair and the screen. Pardon me for making use of you: the idea was innocent, the motive was sacred. You have distressed--and delighted me. My heart bleeds--and thanks you." ...|$|R
2500|$|Coonan's casting as Carl was {{announced}} on 6 May 2013, {{when it was}} revealed that the character is Kirsty Branning's (Kierston Wareing) ex-boyfriend and has been in prison, where he had shared a cell with Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). Coonan said of his casting, [...] "EastEnders {{has been a part of}} my life since I was 12 years old. I even remember talking about the storylines in school playgrounds in Tottenham and I am very happy and proud to now be a small part of its life." [...] Executive producer Lorraine Newman said: [...] "It's wonderful to have Daniel Coonan joining us in Walford to play Carl White. Oozing confidence and with a dangerous edge, will Kirsty be able to resist his bad boy charms for long, or can [...] Max [...] save her from the lure of the dark side?" [...] This is Coonan's second role in EastEnders, as he played David Priors in 2011. Coonan said the four-episode role helped him prepare for a bigger role in the programme, though describing his first day on set as Carl, he said, [...] "it still hits you <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walk</b> on to the Square for the very first time. It's like walking into your TV." [...] Coonan filmed his first scene on the Bridge Street market set. Heat reported that Carl's introduction was part of a [...] "rescue plan" [...] to increase ratings for EastEnders, especially with the announced departures of popular characters Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner), Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) and Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), saying [...] "with ever-dwindling ratings and an unusually bare trophy cabinet, producers have been forced to plan some major shake-ups in an attempt to revive the ailing drama with new characters, returning familiar faces and exciting storylines." [...] Coonan later said of being cast, [...] "When they offered the part of Carl to me, I thought about it as long as it takes to blink your eyelids. I knew it would be a great character and fun to play. Something like this can massively raise your profile. I'm beaming into thousands of people's homes four times a week." [...] Coonan was originally contracted to appear in 28 episodes over a six-month period, but instead filmed over 60 episodes. After Danny Dyer was cast as Mick Carter in the show, he revealed that he was approached to play Carl.|$|E

5000|$|The {{antagonist}} cautions the womans {{new boyfriend}} not to [...] "hate on" [...] {{him when she}} intimately mentions his name, and implies that the new relationship is really [...] "just a game", a theory that he argues is proven by her perceived inability to acknowledge his presence as he watches the new couple: [...] Shes still thinkin bout me, And Ill tell you why, She couldnt even hold her head up <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> byThe song ends with the singer recounting and implying to the new boyfriend various intimate acts that the woman performed for him when [...] "she was my girl".|$|R

2500|$|Yu Fan {{was from}} Yuyao County (餘姚縣), Kuaiji Commandery, {{which is in}} present-day Yuyao, Zhejiang. At a young age, he was already known for being studious and extraordinary. When he was 11, a guest who came to visit his elder brother ignored the young Yu Fan when he walked past him. Yu Fan later wrote to the guest, [...] "I heard that amber does not contain rotten plant {{material}} and that magnets do not attract bent needles. Is it not appropriate for you to ignore me <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> past me?" [...] The guest was very surprised after reading Yu Fan's letter. Yu Fan attracted greater attention after this incident.|$|R

2500|$|Later {{during the}} 1980s, Rather gained further renown for his {{forceful}} and skeptical {{reporting on the}} Iran-Contra affair, which eventually led to an on-air confrontation with then Vice President George H. W. Bush: Bush referred to Rather's [...] "dead air incident" [...] saying, [...] "I {{want to talk about}} why I want to be President, why those 41 percent of the people are supporting me. And I don't think it's fair to judge my whole career by a rehash on Iran. How would you like it if I judged your career by those seven minutes <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> off the set in New York?" [...] Rather ignored Bush's comment.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{the book}} Outlaw: Waylon, Willie, Kris, and the Renegades of Nashville, Chet Atkins first heard of Jennings through comedian Don Bowman, {{who had worked with}} Waylon on the radio in Lubbock, and country singer Bobby Bare. In March 1965, the singer made his first {{recordings}} for RCA in what would be a moderately successful but increasingly frustrated artistic partnership. In the authorized Jennings documentary Renegade Outlaw Legend, Jennings recalled that {{at the time he was}} in awe of the legendary Atkins: [...] "That's God's right hand as far as country music. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>walked</b> in there, the most important thing in your life is to impress him." ...|$|R
