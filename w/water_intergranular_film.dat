40|$|The {{ability of}} {{amorphous}} <b>intergranular</b> <b>films</b> to mitigate damage formation at grain boundaries is studied with molecular dynamics simulations. We find that such films can alter both crack nucleation and crack growth rates by efficiently absorbing dislocations, with thicker films being more effective sinks. Local plastic strain brought by incoming dislocations is diffused into a triangular region within the amorphous film and is accommodated by {{a flow of}} boundary atoms which resembles a vortex shape; this vortex grows inside of the amorphous <b>intergranular</b> <b>film</b> as more dislocations are absorbed until it reaches the opposite amorphous-crystalline interface, after which cracks can finally be nucleated. Even after nucleation, these cracks grow more sluggishly in an amorphous <b>intergranular</b> <b>film</b> than they do along a clean grain boundary, since the driving force for crack growth is lower in the amorphous film. The results presented here suggest that amorphous <b>intergranular</b> <b>films</b> can act as toughening features within a microstructure, and thus are promising for designing nanostructured materials with better ductility and fracture toughness.

Differences in the fracture mode {{of these two}} materials have been analysed structurally and compositionally by transmission electron microscopy. In agreement with the chemistry of the starting materials, similar glass compositions are observed for the two samples from energy dispersive X-ray analysis. In both samples the yttrium-to-oxygen count ratio is lower in <b>intergranular</b> <b>films</b> than in pockets. The interfacial structure of prismatic crystal faces is similar in pockets and in <b>intergranular</b> <b>films,</b> with the main structural difference being a reduction in order {{as a function of}} distance from the prism plane, which is related to the film thickness.

Central in this material development has been systematic transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and mechanical characterizations. In particular, atomic-resolution electron microscopy and nanoprobe composition quantification were combined in analyzing grain boundary structure and nanoscale structural features. Elongated SiC grains with 1 nm-wide amorphous <b>intergranular</b> <b>films</b> were believed to be responsible for the in situ toughening of this material, specifically by mechanisms of crack deflection and grain bridging. Two methods were found to be effective in modifying microstructure and optimizing mechanical performance. First, prescribed post-annealing treatments at temperatures between 1100 and 1500 o C were seen to cause full crystallization of the amorphous <b>intergranular</b> <b>films</b> and to introduce uniformly dispersed nanoprecipitates within SiC matrix grains; in addition, lattice diffusion of aluminum at elevated temperatures was seen to alter grain-boundary composition. Second, adjusting the nominal content of sintering additives was also observed to change the grain morphology, the grain-boundary structure, and the phase composition of the ABC-SiC. In this regard, the roles of individual additives in developing boundary microstructures were identified; this was demonstrated to be critical in optimizing the mechanical properties, including fracture toughness and fatigue resistance at ambient and elevated temperatures, flexural strength, wear resistance, and creep resistance...|$|R
40|$|To {{survive in}} deep {{subsurface}} environments, lithotrophic microbial communities require a sustainable energy source such as hydrogen. Though H 2 {{can be produced}} when water reacts with fresh mineral surfaces and oxidizes ferrous iron, this reaction is unreliable since it depends upon the exposure of fresh rock surfaces via the episodic opening of cracks and fissures. A more reliable and potentially more voluminous H 2 source exists in nominally anhydrous minerals of igneous and metamorphic rocks. Our experimental results indicate that H 2 molecules {{can be derived from}} small amounts of H 2 O dissolved in minerals in the form of hydroxyl, OH- or O 3 Si-OH, whenever such minerals crystallized in an H 2 O-laden environment. Two types of experiments were conducted. Single crystal fracture experiments indicated that hydroxyl pairs undergo an in situ redox conversion to H 2 molecules plus peroxy links, O 3 Si/OO 3. While the peroxy links become part of the mineral structure, the H 2 molecules diffused out of the freshly fractured mineral surfaces. If such a mechanism occurred in natural settings, the entire rock column would become a volume source of H 2. Crushing experiments to facilitate the outdiffusion of H 2 were conducted with common crustal igneous rocks such as granite, andesite, and labradorite. At least 70 nmol of H 2 /g diffused out of coarsely crushed andesite, equivalent at standard pressure and temperature to 5, 000 cm 3 of H 2 /m 3 of rock.

40|$|Traditionally, grain {{boundary}} character in nanoscale materials has been tailored to maximize {{different types of}} mechanical behavior, whether it be exhibiting near-theoretical strengths or prolonging fracture by dramatically increasing a material’s ductility. As more complex systems develop for nuclear and other extreme environment applications, the need for these types of materials is quickly identified. Specifically, materials in a nuclear reactor need to be amended to extend their longevity to promote safety and reliable usage. One strategy for improving radiation tolerance is the design and control of internal interfaces in a material. Atomistic simulations can give insight into the foundational principles of {{grain boundary}} structure and formation. Two comprehensive simulation models are developed to bridge this gap with respect to radiation tolerant interfaces and structural transitions in binary alloy systems.

40|$|The {{fundamental}} {{question as to}} whether thin <b>intergranular</b> <b>films</b> can adopt an equilibrium thickness in polycrystalline ceramics is addressed. Two continuum approaches are presented, one based on interfacial energies and the other on the force balance normal to the boundary. These indicate that there will exist a stable thickness for the <b>intergranular</b> <b>film</b> and that it will be of the order of 1 nm. The origin of an equilibrium thickness is shown {{to be the result of}} two competing interactions, an attractive van der Waals-disperson interaction between the grains on either side of the boundary acting to thin the film and a repulsive term, due to the structure of the intergranular liquid, opposing this attraction. As both of these interactions are of short range (<lo nm), it is a natural consequence that the equilibrium thickness is of the order of 1 nm, a value commensurate with that observed experimentally in a wide range of ceramics. Two further consequences of importance are indicated. The first is that thin intergranular liquid phases can support a normal stress. The second is that the dielectric constants of the adjacent grains play an important role in determining the thicknesses of the intergranular phase. This leads to the conclusion, consistent with observations, that the thickness of the intergranular phase in polyphase ceramics is expected to be different at boundaries between dissimilar phases than that between like phases.

With increasing global composition, the six grain boundary types chosen for this study first form ordered complexions, with the local segregation pattern depending on the grain boundary core structure, then transform into disordered complexions when the grain boundary composition reaches a critical value that is temperature dependent. The tendency for this transition to a disordered interfacial structure consistently depends on the relative solute excess, instead of the grain boundary energy or misorientation angle. Grain boundaries with high relative solute excess go through gradual disordering transitions, whereas those with low relative solute excess remain ordered until high global Zr concentrations but then abruptly transform into thick disordered films.

The third chapter presents results and discussion of the classical simulation results. We have carried out calculations on a large number of twist and tilt grain boundary systems and we have investigated the energetics and segregation properties of cobalt and barium to the Σ 7 twist grain boundary core. We have determined the energies of a large number of twist and tilt boundaries and seen how they fit into known models. The structural units of the Σ 13 tilt boundaries were identified and systems for the ab initio calculations selected. The electronic structure calculations on twist grain boundaries are presented in chapter four, along with the results for segregation of antimony and bismuth to the Σ 7 and Σ 13 boundaries. We have found a limit doping that is approximately the same for very different twist and tilt boundaries and suggests a maximum for the density of interfacial impurity states. The impurity states found were of a donor type and, although they were approximately in the right position in the band gap, they did not correspond to the acceptor states associated with varistor behaviour. The fifth chapter describes the results on tilt grain boundaries and doping with antimony, bismuth and defect complexes. We have investigated the shallow interface states that result from the tilt grain boundaries, the states introduced by oxygen interstitial impurities, the effect of Zn vacancies and the electronic structure of defect complexes. The sixth chapter presents a model <b>intergranular</b> <b>film</b> boundary.
