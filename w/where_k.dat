5|$|The Langenberg Quarry, <b>where</b> <b>K.</b> langenbergensis {{is known}} from, {{is part of}} the Lower Saxony Basin, which would {{have been part of the}} landmass {{associated}} with the Rhenisch, Bohemian, and London-Brabant Massifs. During the Kimmeridgian, it would have been a shallow marine environment; however, this does not imply that K. langenbergensis was marine, since the animals and plants of the Langenberg Quarry were probably transported allochthonously (albeit only by a short distance) from the surrounding islands. Brackish and freshwater sediments are also present in the quarry, which implies that there was occasional freshwater influx. Twigs and conifer cones indicate that the araucarian Brachyphyllum was present at the site.|$|E

In 1977, the family, with the addition of Owen Phillip (his third and last child), traveled briefly to England, returning to Maine that fall, <b>where</b> <b>King</b> began teaching creative writing at the University of Maine.

25|$|It {{allows one}} to more easily study {{infinite}} extensions. Again this is important in algebraic number theory, where for example one often discusses the absolute Galois group of Q, defined to be the Galois group of K/Q <b>where</b> <b>K</b> is an algebraic closure of Q.|$|E
25|$|For {{very large}} numbers, these simple methods are inefficient because they perform {{a large number}} of multiplications or {{divisions}} where one operand is very large. A simple divide-and-conquer algorithm is more effective asymptotically: given a binary number, it is divided by 10k, <b>where</b> <b>k</b> is chosen so that the quotient roughly equals the remainder; then each of these pieces is converted to decimal and the two are concatenated. Given a decimal number, it can be split into two pieces of about the same size, each of which is converted to binary, whereupon the first converted piece is multiplied by 10k and added to the second converted piece, <b>where</b> <b>k</b> is the number of decimal digits in the second, least-significant piece before conversion.|$|E

25|$|This {{distribution}} can {{be generalized}} to more complicated sets than intervals.

25|$|An n-sided {{regular polygon}} can be {{constructed}} with compass and straightedge {{if and only if}} n {{is the product of a}} power of 2 and distinct Fermat primes: in other words, if and only if n is of the form n = 2k'p1p2…p's, <b>where</b> <b>k</b> is a nonnegative integer and the p'i are distinct Fermat primes.|$|E
25|$|This {{definition}} {{can also}} be extended <b>where</b> <b>K</b> is a commutative ring R, in which case a matrix is invertible {{if and only if}} its determinant is an invertible element in R. For example, a matrix A with entries in Z, the integers, is invertible (in the sense that there exists an inverse matrix with integer entries) if the determinant is +1 or −1. Such a matrix is called unimodular.|$|E

25|$|Chemical shift can be {{expressed}} using the formula below, <b>where</b> <b>K</b> is a nuclear constant, the difference between Re2 and Rg2 is the effective nuclear charge radius difference between excited state and the ground state, {{and the difference between}} a and b is the electron density difference on the nucleus (a = source, b = sample). Isomer shift does not change with temperature, however, small changes are generally attributed to second-order Doppler effect.|$|E
25|$|The topological genus of this surface, that is {{the number}} of handles or donut holes, is equal to the {{geometric}} genus of the algebraic curve that may be computed by algebraic means. In short, if one consider a plane projection of a nonsingular curve that has degree d and only ordinary singularities (singularities of multiplicity two with distinct tangents), then the genus is (d1)(d2)/2k, <b>where</b> <b>k</b> {{is the number of}} these singularities.|$|E
25|$|This pattern {{also gives}} {{a method for}} {{determining}} {{the direction of the}} nth turn in the turn sequence of a Heighway dragon iteration. First, express n in the form k2m <b>where</b> <b>k</b> is an odd number. The direction of the nth turn is determined by k mod 4 i.e. the remainder left when k is divided by 4. If k mod 4 is 1 then the nth turn is R; if k mod 4 is 3 then the nth turn is L.|$|E

25|$|For {{parameterized}} {{problems that}} admit a kernelization that preserves planarity {{and reduces the}} input graph to a kernel of size linear in the input parameter, this approach {{can be used to}} design fixed-parameter tractable algorithms the running time of which depends polynomially {{on the size of the}} input graph and exponentially on √k, <b>where</b> <b>k</b> is the parameter of the algorithm. For instance, time bounds of this form are known for finding vertex covers and dominating sets of size k.|$|E
25|$|Though {{a palace}} park, {{the general public}} {{had access to the}} grounds but sailors, dogs and people in poor {{clothing}} or carrying large bundles were turned away by the guard at the park's sole entrance. Not until 1865 did access to the park become unrestricted, in line with what was the case elsewhere in the city, such as at Langelinie. Smørrebrødsplænen (Rge Smørrebrød Lawn), on the corner of Toskildevej and Pile Allé, <b>where</b> <b>K.</b> B.'s tennis halls are today, became a popular picnic destination. for families.|$|E
25|$|By comparison, {{the most}} {{efficient}} randomized primality test for general integers, the Miller–Rabin primality test, requires O(k n2 log n log log n) bit operations using FFT multiplication for an n-digit number, <b>where</b> <b>k</b> {{is the number of}} iterations and is related to the error rate. For constant k, this is in the same complexity class as the Lucas-Lehmer test. In practice however, the cost of doing many iterations and other differences leads to worse performance for Miller–Rabin. The most efficient deterministic primality test for any n-digit number, the AKS primality test, requires Õ(n6) bit operations in its best known variant and is dramatically slower in practice.|$|E
