5|$|The main {{sites of}} copper {{accumulation}} are {{the liver and}} the brain, and consequently liver disease and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis. People with liver problems tend to come to medical attention earlier, generally as children or teenagers, than those with neurological and psychiatric symptoms, <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be in their twenties or older. Some are identified only because relatives {{have been diagnosed with}} Wilson's disease; many of these, when tested, turn out to have been experiencing symptoms of the condition but have not received a diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|The show {{follows the}} {{exploits}} of four boys, Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Eric Cartman and Kenny McCormick. The boys live in the fictional small town of South Park, located within the real-life South Park basin in the Rocky Mountains of central Colorado. The town {{is also home to}} an assortment of frequent characters such as students, families, elementary school staff, and other various residents, <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> regard South Park as a bland, quiet place to live. Prominent settings on the show include the local elementary school, bus stop, various neighborhoods and the surrounding snowy landscape, actual Colorado landmarks, and the shops and businesses along the town's main street, all of which are based on the appearance of similar locations in Fairplay.|$|E

A final t-test confirmed that dyads <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> search independently were more accurate than those <b>tending</b> <b>to</b> split search (t(8.699)[*]=[*] 3.053, p[*]=[*] 0.014). Dyads <b>who</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> split search took significantly less time to search than individuals (t(37.824)[*]=[*]– 2.83, p[*]=[*] 0.007) {{but there was no}} significant difference between dyads <b>who</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> search independently and individuals (t(5.162)[*]=[*] 1.079, p[*]=[*] 0.328). The difference in search time between dyads <b>who</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> search independently and dyads <b>who</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> split search failed to reach significance (t(4.389)[*]=[*] 2.315, p[*]=[*] 0.076).|$|R

5|$|The five-year {{survival}} rate for endometrial adenocarcinoma following appropriate treatment is 80%. Most women, over 70%, have FIGO stage I cancer, {{which has the}} best prognosis. Stage III and especially Stage IV cancers has a worse prognosis, but these are relatively rare, occurring in only 13% of cases. The median survival time for stage III-IV endometrial cancer is nine to tenmonths. Older age indicates a worse prognosis. In the United States, white women have a higher {{survival rate}} than black women, <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> develop more aggressive forms of the disease {{by the time of}} their diagnosis. Tumors with high progesterone receptor expression have a good prognosis compared to tumors with low progesterone receptor expression; 93% of women with high progesterone receptor disease survived to threeyears, compared with 36% of women with low progesterone receptor disease. Heart disease is {{the most common cause of}} death among those who survive endometrial cancer, with other obesity-related health problems also being common.|$|E
25|$|Altogether, about 9% of {{the entire}} Spanish {{population}} attends religious services at least once per month.

25|$|Many social wasp (Vespidae) species exhibit Müllerian mimicry, where a {{group of}} {{unpalatable}} species benefit from sharing the same kind of warning (aposematic) colouration. Wasps are decidedly noxious: nasty-tasting and with a painful sting. They form a Mullerian 'ring' of similarly coloured models; the wasps are often accompanied by clusters of hover-fly mimics, <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> arrive at the flowers at a similar time of day, and whose flight pattern is passably similar to wasp flight.|$|E
25|$|Individuals with FXS {{may present}} {{anywhere}} {{on a continuum}} from learning disabilities {{in the context of}} a normal intelligence quotient (IQ) to severe intellectual disability, with an average IQ of 40 in males who have complete silencing of the FMR1 gene. Females, <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be less affected, generally have an IQ which is normal or borderline with learning difficulties. The main difficulties in individuals with FXS are with working and short-term memory, executive function, visual memory, visual-spatial relationships, and mathematics, with verbal abilities being relatively spared.|$|E
25|$|Psychological factors, {{stressful}} life events, life transitions, and environment {{as well as}} often thinking {{in a way that}} exaggerates relatively normal bodily reactions are also believed {{to play a role in}} the onset of panic disorder. Often the first attacks are triggered by physical illnesses, major stress, or certain medications. People <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> take on excessive responsibilities may develop a tendency to suffer panic attacks. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients also show a much higher rate of panic disorder than the general population.|$|E

25|$|In a {{reversal}} of the demographics of party alignment in the post-Civil War nineteenth century, in the 21st century state, Democrats include liberal whites, African Americans, and other minorities. As of October 2017, 50.39% of the state's voters were officially registered as Democrats, 41.10% were registered Republican, <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be conservative whites. Some 8.51% were registered with some other political party or as Independents. Despite this, the majority of persons who vote in the state have generally elected Republican candidates for federal office since {{around the turn of the}} 21st century.|$|E
25|$|About 41% of the Malagasy are Christian. They {{are divided}} almost evenly between Roman Catholic and Protestant, {{but there are}} also Orthodox Christians. Many {{incorporate}} the cult of the dead with their other religious beliefs and bless their dead at church before proceeding with the traditional burial rites. They also may invite a pastor to attend a famadihana. A historical rivalry exists between the predominantly Catholic masses, considered to be underprivileged, and the predominantly Protestant Merina aristocrats, <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> prevail in the civil service, business, and professions.|$|E
25|$|All {{of these}} {{highways}} {{are in good}} condition, with little traffic congestion. Infrastructure on the highways is well maintained.

Nicaraguan bus companies, {{often referred to as}} Chicken Buses, serve both urban and rural areas to remedy the lack of sufficient infrastructure that plagues these towns or villages.|$|E

25|$|People with schizoid {{personality}} disorder rarely seek treatment for their condition. This is an issue found in many personality disorders, which prevents {{many people who are}} afflicted with these conditions, <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> view their condition as not conflicting with their self-image and their abnormal perceptions and behaviors as rational and appropriate, from coming forward for treatment. There is little data on the effectiveness of various treatments on this personality disorder due to the infrequency of encountering this personality disorder in clinical settings.

25|$|Items {{from the}} shanty and sea song {{repertoire}} {{have been brought}} into the repertoires of performers of folk music, rock, and Western classical music. Sources for these renditions include books by folklorists and commercial recordings by shanty revival performers. The forms these performers produce tend to be quite standardized and relate to their source material {{similar to the way}} a cover song does. This can be contrasted with the method of performers focusing on maritime music, <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> think of themselves as operating within that genre or a tradition, and who develop their repertoire from multiple sources and through various experiences.|$|E
25|$|Montgomery County, {{north of}} Houston, is a Republican stronghold, {{supported}} by voters in affluent communities on Lake Conroe and in The Woodlands. Rural {{residents of the}} county, though primarily lower- and middle-class, {{tend to be very}} socially conservative and also have a substantial Republican following. However, the city of Conroe proper, the county seat, tends to lean Democratic. Although The Woodlands is home to many corporate transplants from Europe, Japan, Canada, and Australia, <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be of a more liberal persuasion, most of these people are not U.S. citizens, thus have little impact on the voting trends of the county.|$|E

25|$|The oldest manuscripts {{discovered}} yet, {{including those}} of the Dead Sea Scrolls, date to about the 2nd century BCE. The common traditional dating of the Pentateuch suggests it was written between the 16th century and the 12th century BCE. Some secular scholars, <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> suggest latter dates, believe that there was a final redaction between 900-450 BCE. The traditional view is that all five books were written in immediate succession, but some scholars believe that Deuteronomy was written later than the other four books. Religious and secular scholars generally agree that the other books of the Bible were written at a latter date than the Pentateuch.|$|E
25|$|There is {{a common}} sense of {{confusion}} between the difference of PTSD and a normal response to trauma. If an athlete injures himself or herself in a horrific way, it is normal {{for them to go}} through some adversity before overcoming the injury. They may develop small flashbacks, have bad dreams, or feel like they can't get the traumatic experience out of their mind, however, depending on the athlete’s mental ability, or how determined they are within their chosen sport, these symptoms can be lifted in time. Along with this, those athletes who are weaker mentally are the ones <b>who</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> not be able to recover themselves and fall into the category of PTSD.|$|E

In particular, the promotion of its female flight attendants known as Singapore Girls has been widely successful and is a common feature {{in most of the}} airline's advertisements and publications. This branding strategy aims to build a mythical aura around the Singapore Girl, and portray her as representative of Asian hospitality and grace and the airline's training program for both cabin and technical flight crew complement this objective. This is similar to the tactics that Pan Am used as they also tried to promote their stewardesses as a big attraction to flying on the airline.|$|E
