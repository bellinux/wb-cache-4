50|$|The {{drum motor}} concept was first {{recorded}} in 1928 {{but was not}} realised until the early 1950s {{when it was first}} produced specifically for conveyor belt applications. The idea was to produce a compact, totally enclosed single component drive unit with high efficiency and lower frictional losses than a conventional geared motor. The new design was quick and easy to install, required no maintenance and because of its totally enclosed IP66 sealed design would be unaffected by dust, dirt grease or water. Today you see many examples of drum motor applications in airport check-in conveyors and security machines, supermarket checkstands, food processing conveyors and <b>weighing</b> <b>equipment.</b> Reversible drum motors are also used for roller shutter doors.|$|E

5000|$|In 2001 Steve Thoburn, {{the main}} {{defendant}} {{in the original}} case, was convicted of two offences under the Weights and Measures Act 1985 of using <b>weighing</b> <b>equipment</b> that was not stamped by a Weights and Measures Inspector. The stamps had been obliterated because the scales were not capable of weighing in the metric system as well as imperial, and hence were no longer permitted for commercial use. He was initially convicted and given a six-month conditional discharge. In Thoburn v Sunderland City Council the fines were challenged in court; the verdict was in favour of Sunderland City Council, upholding the imposition of the fines. The challenges were made {{on the grounds that}} British law does not prohibit the use of imperial units when selling loose goods, but metric units must be displayed simultaneously.|$|E
50|$|Upon taking office, Ansell {{discovered}} that the weighing of metals at the mint was extremely loose, at the mint {{it had been the}} custom to weigh silver to within 0.5 ounces and gold to a pennyweight (0.05 ounces), however these standards meant losses were being made from overvalued metals. In one such case Ansell delivered 7920.00 ounces of gold to the mint where it was weighed by an official at 7918.15 ounces, a difference of 1.85 ounces. Requesting a second weighing on more accurate scale, the bullion was certified to weigh 7919.98 ounces, far closer to the previous measurement which was off by 960 grains. To increase the accuracy of weights, more precise <b>weighing</b> <b>equipment</b> was ordered and specifications were revised to 0.10 ounce for silver and gold to 0.01oz. Between 1856 and 1866 the old scales were gradually removed and replaced with ones made by Messrs. De Grave, Short, and Fanner; winners of the 1856 International Exhibition Prize award.|$|E
