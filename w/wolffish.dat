50|$|The {{northern}} <b>wolffish</b> (Anarhichas denticulatus), or rock turbot, {{is a large}} marine fish of the Anarhichadidae family. Other {{common names}} include the bull-headed catfish, blue catfish, broad-headed catfish, jelly <b>wolffish,</b> and the Arctic <b>wolffish.</b> Inuit in the Western Arctic (Bathurst Inlet) do not distinguish between the northern <b>wolffish</b> and the Bering <b>wolffish</b> (A. orientalis), calling both by the name akoak or akoaksaluk ("old woman fish").|$|E
50|$|The spotted <b>wolffish</b> can be {{distinguished}} from the northern (A. denticulatus) and Atlantic <b>wolffish</b> (A. lupus) by its dark spots.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>wolffish</b> can {{be distinguished}} from the spotted <b>wolffish</b> (A. minor) and the Atlantic <b>wolffish</b> (A. lupus) by its more uniform body colour and its soft, jelly-like musculature. Its head is also proportionally larger to its body and its upper lip is thick and covered with papillae.|$|E

50|$|The {{northern}} <b>wolffish</b> {{is protected}} under the Canadian federal Species at Risk Act (SARA). A recovery team for the northern and spotted <b>wolffish</b> has almost completed a recovery strategy and plan for both species. The strategy provides a framework for improving the status of <b>wolffish</b> through an enhanced understanding of their life history, potential sources of harm, and implementing management measures such as live release of captured <b>wolffish.</b> The plan also includes habitat stewardship and educational activities designed to involve stakeholders and inform the public.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>wolffish</b> {{is thick}} and heavyset, {{with a large}} head and teeth {{at the front of}} the jaw that are smaller and sharper than the other two <b>wolffish</b> species found in Atlantic Canada. The shape and size of its mouth and teeth allow it to capture moving (pelagic) prey. It can grow to 145 cm in length and almost 20 kg in weight. The northern <b>wolffish</b> has a more uniform body colour than the other <b>wolffish</b> species, ranging from grey to dark chocolate, sometimes with a light violet sheen.|$|E
50|$|The Bering <b>wolffish</b> has an {{elongate}} and laterally compressed body, {{with a thin}} caudal peduncle. It has a steep snout, and, {{like other}} <b>wolffish,</b> has long, canine teeth that protrude out past {{the tips of the}} jaws.|$|E

40|$|The stomach {{contents}} of 4320 fishes comprising 14 species {{were collected from}} Flemish Cap Bank (NW Newfoundland) at depths ranging from 130 to 730 m, during summer 1993. The general feeding intensity was high in all species. Three main feeding patterns were evident: the genus Sebastes consume primarily pelagic species, although they also feed on preys which migrate vertically such as shrimps, Euphausids and mysids. The benthic group {{is made up of}} American plaice (Hippoglossoides platessoides), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cygnoglossus), arctic eelpout (Lycodes reticulatus), <b>wolffishes</b> (Anarhichas lupus and Anarhichas minor) and thorny skate (Raja radiata). Lastly, the group of benthopelagic fish remains, longf in hake (Urophycis chesteri), cod (Gadus morhua), grenadiers (Nezumia bairdi and Macrourus berglax) and Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides). Pelagic and benthopelagic preys are an important food resource for all fish considered, the abundance of Hyperids, P. borealis and Sebastes sp. in summer makes them an important food resource in the diet of fish in Flemish Cap...|$|R
50|$|The Atlantic <b>wolffish</b> (Anarhichas lupus), {{also known}} as the seawolf, Atlantic catfish, ocean catfish, devil fish, wolf eel (the common name for its Pacific relative), woof or sea cat, is a marine fish of the <b>wolffish</b> family Anarhichadidae. The numbers of the Atlantic <b>wolffish</b> are rapidly being depleted, most likely due to {{overfishing}} and bycatch, and is currently a Species of Concern according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries Service.|$|E

40|$|Since 1988 Greenland Institute of Natural Resources {{annually}} {{has conducted}} a bottom trawl survey off West Greenland. The {{main purpose of}} the survey is to evaluate the biomass and abundance of Northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis), but data on most fish spices have been recorded. This paper presents biomass and abundance estimates together with length frequencies of cod, Greenland halibut, redfish, <b>wolffishes,</b> American plaice and starry skate from the 2001 survey. Further, a recruitment index for Greenland halibut is presented. Materials and Methods The survey covers the offshore areas at West Greenland between 59 째 00 'N and 72 째 30 'N from the 3 -mile limit to the 600 m depth contour line and the inshore area Disko Bay (Figure 1 and Table 1). The survey area is divided into NAFO Divisions, which were further subdivided into three depth strata (0 - 200, 201 - 400 and 401 - 600 m) on basis of depth contour lines.

40|$|The main {{aim of the}} {{ecosystem}} survey was to map the distribution and abundance of the young and adult stages of several demersal and pelagic fish species, {{and in addition to}} gather information about hydrographical features, zooplankton, benthos, seabirds and sea mammals. The water temperature in all observed areas was higher (+ 0. 5 - 1 째C) than the long term mean and somewhat higher than in the same period 2005. The 2006 year-class of capelin, haddock, herring, long rough dab and sandeel are rich. 0 -group of eastern component of polar cod is near the average level. The 2006 cod and redfish year-class is below than average. 0 -group of Greenland halibut, saithe, western component of polar cod, <b>wolffishs</b> and Gonatus were estimated as poor. The total capelin stock was estimated near 0. 8 million tonnes, which is 2. 4 times higher than last years estimate. About 0. 44 million tonnes were assumed to be maturing. The polar cod stock was estimated to be 1. 9 million tonnes, which is 0. 14 million tonnes higher than last year, but by numbers it was two times lower then in 2005. Juvenile Norwegian spring spawning herring was estimated {{in the southern part of}} the Barents Sea to be 0. 643 million tonnes. Blue whiting of age groups 1 to 14 were observed in the western and southwestern parts of the surveyed area, and the biomass of this stock component was estimated to be 0. 770 million tonnes...|$|R

50|$|The {{manner of}} which Atlantic <b>wolffish</b> {{fertilize}} their eggs distinguishes them from many fish. Instead {{of the female}} depositing her eggs in the open ocean for the male fish to fertilize and then continue on his way, they are internally fertilized and the male <b>wolffish</b> stays with the nest and protects the eggs {{for as long as}} four months, until the brood is strong enough to gain independence. Their eggs are 5.5-6.0 mm in diameter, (among the largest fish eggs known), yellow tinted and opaque. The eggs are laid on the ocean floor, many times in shoal water, sticking together in loose clumps, surrounded by seaweed and stones. Atlantic <b>wolffish</b> mature relatively late, at age six.|$|E

50|$|Northern <b>wolffish</b> are {{demersal}} fish. In summer, mature females lay up to 30,000 extremely {{large eggs}} in a nest on the sea floor. Adults are observed to make limited movements and are not migratory. The northern <b>wolffish</b> favours open continental-shelf water that is cold, usually between 2 and 5째C, and mainly at depths between 400 and 1000 m. The fish is thought to prefer a rocky or muddy sea floor, but is found over all types of ocean bottoms. Sharp teeth and powerful jaws allow the northern <b>wolffish</b> to capture moving (pelagic) fish, starfish, sea urchins, and crabs. They also include some bottom-dwelling (benthic) organisms in their diets. Their fearsome teeth, however, ensure they have few natural predators. They are not retained by fishermen for food because of their watery and jelly-like flesh.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from their}} unique {{appearance}} <b>wolffish</b> are distinguished {{by the natural}} antifreeze they produce to keep their blood moving fluidly in their very cold habitat, involvement by both {{the male and female}} in brood bearing, and the large size of their eggs. They are also an important factor in controlling green crab and sea urchin populations, which can become overly disruptive to habitats if left unchecked. <b>Wolffish</b> population success is also an important indicator of the health of other bottom-dweller populations, such as Atlantic cod.|$|E
5000|$|Three {{related species}} (Atlantic, {{northern}} and spotted <b>wolffish)</b> {{occur in the}} north Atlantic. The northern <b>wolffish</b> has loose gelatinous flesh, but the other species are esteemed as food, both fresh and preserved. They are marketed in Britain as [...] "Scotch halibut" [...] and [...] "Scarborough woof", or, simply [...] "woof" [...] {{in other areas of}} the northeast coast, and are a popular ingredient in fish and chips. The oil extracted from the liver is said to be equal in quality to the best cod liver oil.|$|E

5000|$|On October 1, 2008, the Conservation Law Foundation (CLF), {{along with}} Dr. Erica Fuller and Dr. Les Watling, petitioned the US NMFS for the {{protection}} of the Atlantic <b>wolffish</b> under the ESA. The petition called {{for the protection}} of the Atlantic <b>wolffish</b> and <b>wolffish</b> habitat throughout the US northwest Atlantic waters. It recommended a designation of critical habitat be set up to close off both commercial and recreational fishing in those areas (which would overlap closed areas for various other fishing industries for the benefit of fishermen), the development of catch and release protocols, educational programs for fishermen in the Gulf of Maine area, and possession prohibitions. [...] On January 1, 2009 the NMFS announced a positive 90-day finding that the petition was warranted, which triggered the initiation of a status review which will result in a decision on whether to list the species under the ESA. On November 6, 2009, the NMFS issued a finding that the proposed protections were not warranted.|$|E
