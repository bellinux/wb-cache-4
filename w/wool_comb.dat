The family business expanded into a major concern producing {{a quarter of all}} the world's rough yarn and employed almost 4,500 workers in the complex. Labour came from Eastern Europe. Between 1885 and 1905 the population of Delmenhorst tripled causing a chronic lack of housing. The firm responded by building ever more company housing on the “Nordwolle” site.|$|R

50|$|It {{initially}} grew {{around the}} <b>wool</b> <b>combing</b> industry, until {{the onset of}} the plague, which swept the town from 1663 to 1665. To prevent the spread of the disease, the town was chained at either end, which succeeded in its task but at the cost of two-thirds of the populace. The town did not recover for nearly two hundred years, with the canalisation of the River Gipping in the late 18th Century and the introduction of the railway. Modern Needham Market contains two road names that are linked to the plague. Chainhouse Road, named after the chains that ran across the East end of the town. The Causeway, is a modern variation of 'the corpseway' so called because of the route that plague victims were transported out of town, to neighbouring Barking church for interment.|$|R
50|$|In iconography, Blaise is {{represented}} holding two crossed candles {{in his hand}} (the Blessing of St. Blaise), or in a cave surrounded by wild beasts, as he was found by the hunters of the governor. He is often shown with the instruments of his martyrdom, steel combs. The similarity of these instruments of torture to <b>wool</b> <b>combs</b> led to his adoption as {{the patron saint of}} wool combers in particular, and the wool trade in general. He may also be depicted with crossed candles. Such crossed candles are used for the blessing of throats on his feast day, which falls on 3 February, the day after Candlemas on the General Roman Calendar. Blaise is traditionally believed to intercede in cases of throat illnesses, especially for fish-bones stuck in the throat.|$|R
50|$|The second {{building}} was in Manchester Road and {{was completed in}} 1938, {{on the site of}} Joseph Cooper's Central Mills <b>Wool</b> <b>Combing</b> works. It was an 2,713-seat super cinema built for Oscar Deutsch's Odeon Cinemas as a competitor to what was then the New Victoria. Odeon's house style was futuristic Art Deco, and this one was a Streamline Moderne building designed by the architect Robert Bullivant of Harry Weedon and Partners. A Luftwaffe air raid in August 1940 seriously damaged the building, but despite wartime restrictions Deutsch had extensive repairs completed in only 10 weeks, reopening the cinema on Armistice Day 1940. Capacity was slightly reduced to 2,685 seats. Odeon closed the cinema in 1969 and sold it to Bradford City Council, which had it demolished {{to make way for a}} realignment of Manchester Road.|$|R

50|$|All {{were built}} in the early 18th century - and were {{subsequently}} the scene of protests and riots and breaking down of toll bars. The turnpike roads helped establish Bradford's position as a centre of the textile trades- The Bradford Piece Hall was built in 1770 - but they had little impact on life in Bowling. On the eve of the industrial revolution this still followed a centuries-old pattern of small pastoral farmers supplementing their earnings by home handloom weaving and <b>wool</b> <b>combing</b> and small scale coal mining. Most were tenants. Land ownership was still concentrated in the hands of Wood, the owner of Bolling Hall, who was also Lord of The Manor. In 1780 virtually all the land between Wakefield Road and the boundary with West Bowling belonged to him, besides many parcels in West Bowling. Between Back Lane, Sticker Lane and Wakefield Road Rawson (Lord of the manor of Bradford) was the principal landowner. South of Rooley Lane the principal landowner was Richardson of Bierley Hall. Bierley Church, built on land donated by Richardson, was in East Bowling. In the west of the township were a number of smaller landlords.|$|R

5000|$|The first {{official}} reference to Blackpool in Cork City as an urban centre was {{in relation to}} the building of a Guard House in 1734 mentioned in the Cork Corporation minute book. Its early development can be traced to it being on the main thoroughfare from Cork City to the north with roads leading to the important destinations of Mallow, Limerick and Dublin. Dublin Street and Hill in Blackpool were named after this route. Weaving became identified with Blackpool from its early beginnings and it was later recalled that the cabins of Blackpool were a hive of <b>wool</b> <b>combing</b> and weaving. The success of weaving in Blackpool can in part be attributable to British Army and Naval contracts that accrued to the area. The Revolutionary War period (1793-1815) was a buoyant time for weaving in Blackpool as a result. But after the war ended and the Act of Union of 1801 eventually allowed cheaper industrial clothing to invade the Irish market it marked the end of the cabin weaving industry of Blackpool. Many of the weavers from Blackpool emigrated to Britain. Thereafter Blackpool had a concentration of industries such as tanning, bacon curing, brewing and distilling. As well as being a suburb, Blackpool is regarded by some as a now faded commercial and social centre of working class districts on the northside of Cork City. A vibrant working class community developed, its identity reinforced by the area's association with icons such as Taoiseach (Prime Minister of the Republic of Ireland) and hurler Jack Lynch, Christy Ring (commonly regarded as the greatest hurler of all time) and footballer Charlie Hurley.|$|R

5000|$|During the 1970s, Lauren, Calvin Klein and Perry Ellis became {{particularly}} {{known for}} their sportswear designs, made in all-natural fibres such as <b>wool,</b> <b>combed</b> cotton, and linen, which placed them at the top tier of American fashion design alongside the Anne Klein label (designed by Donna Karan and Louis Dell'Olio). Newsweek in 1975 described Calvin Klein as having styled his clean, casual separates with the authority of a couture designer, and by 1985, Martin described him as [...] "one of the great American stylists" [...] with a solid international reputation and worldwide influence entirely based on his skills as a sportswear designer. The industry empires of Lauren and Calvin Klein would be joined in the mid-1980s by Donna Karan's own-name label and Tommy Hilfiger, each of whom created distinctive wardrobes for the American woman based upon stylish but wearable, comfortable and interchangeable multi-purpose clothes that combined practicability with luxury. These clothes were also designed to have a long, stylish and undated life, rather than to only be fashionable for one season. In 1976, the designer Zoran brought out {{the first of a}} number of collections of extremely simple garments made of the finest quality fabrics; garments that barely changed over the years and which became cult objects to his wealthy clientele. In 1993, the fashion journalist Suzy Menkes declared Zoran's less-is-more sportswear prophetic of the early 1990s modernist trend, whilst Zoran stated that the work of Calvin Klein, Karan, and the Anne Klein label epitomised the [...] "comfort, simplicity, and practicality" [...] associated with sportswear. Most early 21st century sportswear design follows in the footsteps of these designers. Other notable sportswear designers of the late 20th century include Norma Kamali, whose 1980s fashionable garments made from sweatshirt fabric were highly influential; [...] Marc Jacobs, whose eponymous label renowned for layered informality in both day and evening wear was founded in 1986, and Isaac Mizrahi, who presented his first collection in 1987.|$|R

50|$|Combing is {{a method}} for {{preparing}} carded fiber for spinning. Combing is divided into linear and circular combing. The Noble comb {{is an example of}} circular combing. The French comb is an example of linear combing. The process of combing is accompanied by gilling, a process of evening out carded or combed top making it suitable for spinning. Combing separates out short fibers by means of a rotating ring or rectilinear row of steel pins. The fibers in the 'top' it produces have been straightened and lie parallel to each other. When <b>combing</b> <b>wool,</b> the discarded short fibers are called noils, and are ground up into shoddy.|$|R

50|$|While the Tone Mills {{site was}} able to use water wheels on the River Tone for power generation, Tonedale Mills {{initially}} used smaller watercourses, Westford Brook and Rockwell Green Stream. In order to ensure that they had a constant supply of water, and that it was used as efficiently as possible, Thomas Fox had water basins excavated between 1801 and 1803, establishing a series of waterways, weirs and sluices to manage the water supply. The original timber mill burned down in 1821, and was replaced by a brick mill, which remains today. The large site features a number of mills, warehouses, workshops and engine houses.

[...] (Top is cleaned <b>combed</b> <b>wool</b> with the fibers all parallel) The finer the average diameter of a single wool fiber, the more hanks could be spun.

By the 1880s Mills was exhibiting at the Hay Agricultural show in which they won 104 champions and 60 second prizes. As his partners died Mills acquired their shares of the enterprise and eventually was the sole owner of Uardry.

5000|$|The Southdowns {{had long}} dark brown or black legs, matured early, {{produced}} {{the best of}} mutton and a fine quality of medium wool. The original Hampshire was larger, coarser, but hardier, slower to mature, with inferior flesh, and a longer but coarser wool. The Southdown had always been remarkable for its power of transmitting its special characteristics to its progeny by other kinds of sheep, and hence it soon impressed its own characteristics on its progeny by the Hampshire.

40|$|Publications on roman {{textiles}} {{have described}} the processing of wool in the following operational sequence: shearing, scouring, combing and spinning. As one can exclude large scale spinning of ‘crude’ wool and degreasing makes fibers too dry and tangled to be worked with, {{it seems likely that}} even in the classical world it was common practice to oil <b>wool</b> before <b>combing</b> and spinning. This procedure has been regularly attested from the late Medieval period up to the present day but was first described in detail in a fifteenth century manuscript from Florence. There are however a few clues that might suggest that the oiling of wool was already known and indeed widespread in classical times and that olive oil was in common use for this purpose. Archaeological evidence for a connection between oil and wool would seem to be limited to a site in Cyprus where it is believed that scented oils were produced, amongst other things, to perfume wool. A reference to this technique could be inferred by Homer’s description of the looms in Alcinoo’s palace “dripping with oil”; and on several attic vases there are scenes of women engaged in processing or perhaps more specifically in the oiling of wool. The possibility that the Romans used oil for softening wool seems convincing above all for the number of classical references to the initial degreasing of untreated wool to remove lanolin, {{as well as to the}} degreasing of finished textiles with fuller’s earth, perhaps to remove oil added in the process. Further information may be gleaned from inscribed lead tags that refer to initial washing and degreasing (indicating lana purgata as opposed to lana sucida), perhaps followed by softening (lana mulsa). Confirmation of the antiquity of this missing link in wool to textile processing has clear implications for future archaeological research in the fields both of textiles and the production/distribution of olive oil for industrial use...|$|R
