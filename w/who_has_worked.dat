5|$|Dominic Fontana, a {{geographer}} at the University of Portsmouth, has voiced {{support for}} du Bellay's {{version of the}} sinking based on the battle as it is depicted in the Cowdray Engraving, and modern GIS analysis of the modern scene of the battle. By plotting the fleets and calculating the conjectured final manoeuvres of the Mary Rose, Fontana reached {{the conclusion that the}} ship had been hit low in the hull by the galleys and was destabilised after taking in water. He has interpreted the final heading of the ship straight due north as a failed attempt to reach the shallows at Spitbank only a few hundred metres away. This theory has been given partial support by Alexzandra Hildred, one of the experts <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>worked</b> with the Mary Rose, though she has suggested that the close proximity to Spitbank could also indicate that the sinking occurred while trying to make a hard turn to avoid running aground.|$|E

Scully and Ritter learn of the crime and {{of the fact that}} Fellig's prints are on the knife.
