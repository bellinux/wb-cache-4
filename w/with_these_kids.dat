50|$|On the February 26 at 9 o’clock, Ninel {{left for}} work.

50|$|Brace {{received}} special {{discounts on}} fares for the orphan {{children from the}} railroads. Whole coaches were sometimes filled <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>kids.</b> Prior to departure, they were bathed, given new clothes, a coat, often a Bible, and reminded of good manners. The trains transported children from lodging houses, orphanages, private homes or the street, bringing them to towns where local organizers had created interest in the program. Notices were posted around town and in newspapers, informing locals when the children would arrive and of the viewing location. The Children's Aid Society (CAS) made arrangements with train companies for the children (in groups {{ranging in size from}} three to 35, along with at least two adult agents) to travel in regular passenger coaches, not in wooden box cars as is sometimes depicted in novels. At towns along the route, the children assembled at the train station or were brought to opera houses, schools, or town halls for the community to meet and interview.|$|E
30|$|Variables {{related to}} number of {{children}} in the household have negative marginal effects as for food security is concerned. That is, when compared to the omitted category, No kids, households with two kids, three kids, four kids and more than four kids are 2.4, 4.9, 7.6, and 11.4 percentage points, respectively, less likely to be food secure. As expected the marginal effects are positive for each of the food insecurity categories, meaning that the probability of being food insecure is higher for households <b>with</b> <b>kids.</b> <b>These</b> probabilities increase monotonically with the number of kids in the household (see Table  2).|$|R

5000|$|Confident {{from their}} recent success, the conspirators viewed the February 10 game against Holy Cross as an {{opportunity}} to reap the full benefits of their scheme. They were aware that bookmakers generally accepted large bets on this game because Boston College and Holy Cross were traditional rivals and also because the game was being nationally televised. Holy Cross was favored to win and, consistent with the scheme, the conspirators bet on Holy Cross to win by a margin greater than the point spread, 7. Holy Cross ultimately won by only two points, 98-96, as Ernie Cobb scored eight points in the final minute to bring BC close, and everyone involved lost a substantial amount of money. Hill stated that, at the time, he and Burke were watching the game on television at Burke's home in Howard Beach, Queens, and when it was over Burke, having lost $50,000 of his own money on the game, put his foot through his television set in a rage. Said Hill, [...] "He wanted me to fly up to Boston. Ultimately, nothing happened. Jimmy said he was finished. He didn't want to be bothered <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> anymore." [...] The scheme thus ended on an unsuccessful note.|$|E
5000|$|... "Documenting wartime {{human rights}} {{violations}} {{used to be my}} job. Over a good few years, working for the United Nations, I witnessed the most appalling acts of cruelty and inhumanity. Often I arrived on a scene to find mutilated bodies, wounded or deeply traumatised survivors and smouldering buildings.A few times I was a direct witness to atrocity, like the summary execution of “rebels” in the streets of Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone. In that country the perpetrators were sometimes just teenagers, many of whom had themselves been abducted years beforehand. I used to speak <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>kids,</b> who were often armed to the teeth and high on drugs, to try to persuade them to release kidnapped children. More than once I came close to being killed, sometimes by being {{in the wrong place at}} the wrong time but more often for such stupid reasons as driving a faulty jeep or begging a lift on an ancient helicopter.My main job was to chronicle what was going on, frame it in terms of the relevant international human-rights law and get the reports up the line to UN decisionmakers in New York and Geneva. The work sometimes seemed futile, even cruel, fuelling false expectations among people who co-operated with us.Often it felt as if no one cared. My own boss when I worked in Bosnia, the former prime minister of Poland Tadeusz Mazowiecki, resigned in protest at the ignoring of his warning about the imminent massacre at Srebrenica. I never quit, but I did have moments of near despair. I recall sitting in tears on a veranda in Freetown, listening to the worsening artillery fire in nearby hills at a moment when the world seemed to have interest in only one conflict: the one far away in Kosovo.What kept my colleagues and I going were the small achievements: protecting some people simply because of our presence, improving conditions in detention facilities, helping to ensure that food and aid were distributed equitably, seeking to keep the situation of innocent victims of war to the forefront of peacemakers’ attention.The chronicling also had its successes, especially for the delivery of postconflict justice. It was very satisfying for me many years later to present my reports and give evidence at the trials in which the Liberian president Charles Taylor and others were convicted of crimes against humanity." ...|$|E

5000|$|We {{had just}} {{advanced}} from our rear camp in Dekemhare into Senafe. We had crossed both trench lines in Senafe and their mine fields. Tensions were very high {{for not only}} the Eritrea and Ethiopian armies but for us as well. There was still military forces in the area, whom {{were not supposed to}} be there. We knew our task of getting the militaries to withdraw would be tuff. We set up camp in the school yard at the base of that amazing cliff. My Lieutenant and I left the camp right away to search for a well in the city and this is when it first happened. The children in the city gathered around us and said [...] "Canada" [...] while pulling our hands to lead us somewhere. Now there was no way we were going anywhere <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>kids.</b> This thing smelled of an ambush badly. How did they know the word [...] "Canada" [...] and why were they so eager to lead us away? The two of us then returned to the schoolyard and reported this unusual event to Headquarters (HQ). 2 weeks went by and each patrol that entered the city had the same experience with the kids. Each time they would report it to HQ and say they did not follow the children. Finally HQ got tired of hearing about these children and orders us to investigate. Now this is when it gets embarrassing for us. We geared up to follow these kids like we were entering an ambush...we were ready for anything that may happen. We had over 300 rounds of ammunition per soldier, flak jackets, radios, machine guns. We {{were not going to be}} caught off guard. When we entered the city, the same routine happened with the kids, but this time we let them lead us. Weapons on our shoulders we walked through the city slowly waiting for something to happen. I remember how hot it was that day and how much I was sweating. Finally we got to a cemetery on the outskirts of the city and the kids started pointing at this tombstone. We looked at the name [...] "COL DUNN". When we got back to camp we radioed in what had happened. HQ sent a report back to Canada asking them to figure out who this DUNN was. A week later we found out. The kids had led us to the grave of a Canadian war hero R. Dunn, one of the first winners of the Victoria Cross. The highest order of merit issues in the Canadian Forces. This man was a legend. He had gone on safari Africa in 1860's and never returned. He was a Canadian hero who had been lost for over a hundred years. These kids whom we thought were leading us into an ambush had done Canada a great service and located Colonel R. Dunn Victoria Cross. If those kids were not as persistent as they were we would never have followed them and we would have never found Colonel Dunn. Ben Mitchell ...|$|E

40|$|I {{chose to}} design a Juvenile Detention Centre because in a city like Jerusalem that is so {{unstable}} and constantly filled with conflict {{a lot of this}} tension is bound to effect the youth. This may lead to uncharacteristically violent and anti-social behavior from the children. Therefore {{there needs to be a}} centre set up that can deal <b>with</b> <b>these</b> <b>kids</b> that have lost their way. This Juvenile Detention centre has been designed with a focus on rehabilitation rather than oppression and punishment. The centre has been designed to get de-railed youth back on track rather than continually punishing them, which can lead to them being embedded in a continuing cycle of criminal activity. The main goal of the centre is for the prisoners to leave the centre as mature young men who have the skills and capabilities necessary to contribute to the community. With large spaces and high light penetration the prison takes advantage of its hilltop position, opening its façade to an expansive view of Jerusalem allowing the prisoners to feel a degree of freedom whilst in confinement. This further emphasizes the philosophy of the centre focused on rehabilitation. Constructive activities are encouraged with plenty of space dedicated to productive outlets such as the wood workshop, rooftop garden, classrooms and gym area which is also on the rooftop. The façade works its way from closed confined spaces at one end to very open spaces at the other which is a metaphor for the inmates journey to once again be able to contribute to the community.
