5|$|The first area {{of major}} dispute was the manner {{by which the}} lower house would be apportioned. A {{minority}} <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to be apportioned so that all states would have equal weight, though this was never seriously considered. Most <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> apportioned in accordance with some mixture of property and population. Though there was discussion on how to calculate property for this purpose, the issue of property was later dropped because of its difficulty, and an assumption that property would closely correlate to population.|$|E

5|$|When I {{would look}} at the films as a whole, I would search for story reasons to use 3-D in {{different}} ways. In Toy Story, for instance, when the toys were alone in their world, I <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to feel consistent to a safer world. And when they went out to the human world, that's when I really blew out the 3-D to make it feel dangerous and deep and overwhelming.|$|E

5|$|When {{some of the}} behind-the-scenes footage {{was used}} in a BET Access Granted special, some of the scenes that Beyoncé was shown {{shooting}} did {{not appear in the}} finished video. Beyoncé said that the video did not turn out the way she <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to be and she had to reshoot most of it. In post-production, she decided that it would be more artistic to play the events in reverse.|$|E
5|$|Al-Maʿarri's {{fundamental}} pessimism {{is expressed}} in his anti-natalist recommendation that no children should be begotten, so as to spare them the pains of life. In an elegy composed by him {{over the loss of}} a relative, he combines his grief with observations on the ephemerality of this life: Even on al-Maʿarri's epitaph, he <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> written that his life was a wrong done by his father and not one that was done by himself.|$|E
5|$|Before Lauper {{covered the}} song, the band The Cars {{produced}} {{an early version}} of it that was not released. Shear's version was originally a folk rock song, but Lauper instead turned it into a pop ballad for her album, with a heavy emphasis on a synthesizer. According to Lauper, she <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to be just like Shear's version, with a bit more of an acoustic sound. However, she changed her mind, saying that she wanted to sing it like herself. Unlike her other singles from the album, this one did not have a music video released with it.|$|E

[...] "I {{would like to have}} a record out," [...] Hill told Billboard.com, [...] "but it hasn't been the right thing yet. I don't <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to be just another record. It's a lot of work to support a record, so I just <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to be ... really great. I <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to represent where I am as a woman. I don't <b>want</b> <b>it</b> to be fake.

5|$|Development of {{the game}} was handled {{by a team of}} seven people over the course of ten months. It was {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi, and was originally planned to be a Game Boy Color game about a private investigator. The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to be easy enough for even his mother to play. While the original version {{of the game}} takes place in Japan, the localization is set in the United States; this became an issue when localizing later games, where the Japanese setting was more obvious.|$|E
5|$|I <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to {{be almost}} like a photo album, so every single scene {{is kind of like}} a picture that you're kind of looking into our relationship. So it is a 1920s vibe, it's black and white, very high fashion—you know, you'll see me very dapper in 1920s, Frank Sinatra-ish. So you'll see the cars from that era, you'll {{definitely}} feel the vibe of the house having that 1920s vibe as well. So it's very different and very intimate, and it's not a lot of dancing—it's more personal.|$|E
5|$|Planning of the {{extension}} of the suburban light rail Holmenkollen Line to the city center started in 1901. Construction began in 1912, but stopped again in 1914 because the municipality and the company could not agree on the location of the terminal station. The municipality <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> at Ruseløkkveien. The following year, the municipality launched a contest to make the best suggestion for the tram networks. It took five years to select a winner, and this allowed the municipality and company to make a compromise by locating the terminus at Nationaltheatret. But not until 1926 was permission granted for the station. Construction commenced and the station and tunnel opened in 1928.|$|E
5000|$|... "I <b>Want</b> <b>It</b> All" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} mainstream music critics and fans alike. The most popular criticism of [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>It</b> All" [...] is that unlike their previous work, [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>It</b> All" [...] {{does not include}} Heidemann's signature rapping. Some people think that [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>It</b> All" [...] was an interesting departure and prefer it over their previous single, [...] "Acapella". Comparisons {{have been made to}} Justin Timberlake's [...] "Take Back the Night" [...] because of its slick disco-tinged pop tune. MTV Buzzworthy noted that [...] "I <b>Want</b> <b>It</b> All" [...] has a mixture of Justin Timberlake's [...] "Take Back the Night" [...] and DJ Cassidy, Jessie J and Robin Thicke's [...] "Calling All Hearts".|$|R

5|$|The Buzz on Maggie is an American {{animated}} {{television series}} created by Dave Polsky for Disney Channel. The series centers on an ambitious and expressive tween fly named Maggie Pesky {{and her family}} and friends. The show is set in Stickyfeet, a city for insects located in a dump. While conceptualizing the series, Polsky <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to contain a playful aspect at adolescence and director Dave Wasson formed the overall look of the characters, being heavily influenced by early Walt Disney cartoon shorts. The Buzz on Maggie was Disney's first series to be fully animated in Adobe Flash, a process done by Bardel Entertainment and Future Thought Productions.|$|E

5|$|The {{committee}} was incensed by the untraditional proposal, but Rodin would not yield. In 1895, Calais succeeded in having Burghers displayed in their preferred form: {{the work was}} {{placed in front of}} a public garden on a high platform, surrounded by a cast-iron railing. Rodin had <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> located near the town hall, where it would engage the public. Only after damage during the First World War, subsequent storage, and Rodin's death was the sculpture displayed as he had intended. It is one of Rodin's best-known and most acclaimed works.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi {{as the last}} game in an Ace Attorney trilogy; he also <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> {{to be the final}} entry in the series, as he felt he had explored Phoenix's character fully. Because he was satisfied with the gameplay in Justice for All, he did not introduce any new gameplay mechanics in Trials and Tribulations. Flashbacks were used as a major theme in the game; this originated in Takumi {{trying to come up with}} a way of handling dialogue-integrated tutorials, and deciding to use a flashback to a case from when Mia was a rookie attorney.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{extending}} the Holmenkollen Line from Majorstuen {{to the city}} center had started in 1901. The process had been delayed several times because of disagreements between {{the city and the}} company, in part because the two could not agree if it should be classified as a railway or a tramway. Construction started in 1912, but stopped again in 1914 because the municipality and the company could not agree on the location of the terminus. The municipality <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> at Ruseløkkveien, but this would make it difficult for the company to build the tunnel through the city center to connect to the suburban tramways east of the city center. Construction was stopped in October 1914.|$|E

5|$|The state {{government}} {{made the decision}} to decommission Fremantle Prison in 1983, but it remained in operation until 30 November 1991. Prisoners were moved to a new metropolitan maximum security prison at Casuarina and the prison was transferred to the Building Management Authority. There were divergent views in the community over the site's future: some <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> demolished and redeveloped, or turned into gardens with a small monument; others wanted the historic site to be preserved, but were opposed to turning the misery of prisoners into entertainment for tourists. The ultimate decision was for conservation of the prison, but allowing for the buildings to be adapted for reuse by the community.|$|E
5|$|All artwork for {{the album}} was {{selected}} from a contest held by DeviantArt. The contestants were asked to design {{a new version of}} Vic Rattlehead, the band mascot which appears on nearly every Megadeth album cover. Mustaine chose from the top 11 finalists {{to be included in the}} CD booklet. The cover was unveiled in August 2006, of which the image depicts the United Nations headquarters in flames and being destroyed by flying oil barrels. Vic Rattlehead (the Megadeth mascot) and the 'Angel of Deth' are pictured in the foreground. Although the cover of the CD was not the winner of the contest, Mustaine chose it as his favorite picture, and <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> for the cover. No photographs of the band were taken for the CD booklet, leaving the entire design as fan-made artwork.|$|E
5|$|Alright, {{the main}} titles. Why the change? As you'll see here, the {{previous}} titles {{were such a}} high school aesthetic. It would have felt silly {{for me to go}} back to college with the same sort of look—the notebook paper. So it felt like we needed to change for college anyway. And in season one when we first did the titles, the network was very clear on wanting to sell it as a high school show rather than a noir show. But once we went to college and had a chance to redo the titles I <b>wanted</b> <b>it</b> to feel noir. For the new theme song, Thomas asked The Dandy Warhols to commission a remix of their original track, which Thomas reported enjoying upon first listening.|$|E
