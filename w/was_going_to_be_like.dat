500|$|Some modern authors {{suggest that}} Druitt was {{dismissed}} {{because he was}} a homosexual or pederast and that may have driven him to suicide. One speculation is that the money found on his body was going to be used for payment to a blackmailer. Others, however, think that {{there is no evidence of}} homosexuality and that his suicide was instead precipitated by an hereditary psychiatric illness. His mother suffered from depression and was institutionalised from July 1888. She died in an asylum in Chiswick in 1890. His maternal grandmother committed suicide while insane, his aunt attempted suicide., and his eldest sister committed suicide in old age. A note written by Druitt and addressed to his brother William, who was a solicitor in Bournemouth, was found in Druitt's room in Blackheath. It read, [...] "Since Friday I felt that I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> mother, and the best thing for me was to die." ...|$|E
500|$|Gibson {{traveled}} to Tokyo in 2001 {{to prepare for}} this new novel, which takes place in London, Moscow, and Tokyo. He did not travel to London or Moscow but used interviews with friends and internet resources for research. In September 2001 Gibson had written about 100pages but was struggling to finish. He stopped writing after watching the September 11, 2001 attacks on television and [...] "realized [...] had become a story {{that took place in}} an alternate time track, in which Sept. 11 hadn't happened". He considered abandoning the novel but a few weeks later re-wrote portions to use the attacks as a motivating factor for the distress the main character feels. In a 2003 interview he said, [...] "There I was, in the winter of 2001, with no idea what the summer of 2002 <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like.</b> ... In the original post-9/11 draft, London felt more like London is feeling right now. Cayce keeps seeing trucks full of soldiers. But I took that out, because as it got closer to the time, it wasn't actually happening." ...|$|E
500|$|Rings Around the World was the Super Furry Animals' {{first album}} for Epic Records {{following}} the demise, in 1999, {{of their previous}} label Creation {{and the success of}} 2000's Mwng, which was issued on the band's own label, Placid Casual. Singer Gruff Rhys has stated that the band aimed to make a [...] "laid back and sort of wiped clean" [...] record with Rings.... In a 2008 interview with Uncut Rhys described the album as [...] "a very ambitious project" [...] stating that [...] "We were trying to make a blockbuster album that <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> The Eagles ... We were trying to make utopian pop music that had pretensions of being progressive and exciting." [...] Rings... was originally going to be called Text Messaging is Destroying the Pub Quiz as We Know It and released as a double album containing 75–90 minutes of material with Rhys stating that he was [...] "into the excess of it, that was the whole point". The group eventually decided against the idea but, drawn by the technical capabilities of the format and the desire to do something that had never been done before, produced a DVD version of Rings..., making it the first album to be simultaneously released on CD and DVD. The DVD features a surround sound mix alongside music videos and remixes and was made possible only by the financial backing of Epic.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from television critics. Aaron Kinney from Salon magazine {{said that the}} episode title showed that the creators at least still {{had a sense of}} humor, but that the episode demonstrated some of the flaws that caused the series to jump the shark in the first place: [...] "cheesy melodrama, deathly slow pacing, and a lack of coherence". John Keegan from Critical Myth was also negative about the episode and awarded it a 4 out of 10. He called it [...] "one of the worst episodes of the season", and hoped that it was no indication of what the series finale <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like.</b> Furthermore, Keegan criticized the fact that David Duchovny did not make a cameo appearance [...] "either full frame or in the distance", given his history with the Lone Gunmen. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five, and noted that [...] "there's nothing celebratory" [...] about the entry. The two were highly critical of the episode's conclusion, calling it [...] "such a bland way of dying that for a moment, you feel you must have missed the point". Shearman and Pearson, furthermore, argued that [...] "The Lone Gunmen deserved better. No, worse than that—we deserved better." [...] M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, criticized the [...] "goofy tone" [...] of the episode, saying it felt [...] "very out of place" [...] {{within the context of the}} series.|$|E
500|$|Before the Clash's founding, the band's future {{members were}} active in {{different}} parts of the London music scene. John Graham Mellor sang and played rhythm guitar in the pub rock act the 101'ers, which formed in 1974. By the time the Clash came together two years later, he had already abandoned his original stage name, [...] "Woody" [...] Mellor, in favour of [...] "Joe Strummer", a reference to his rudimentary strumming skills on the ukulele as a busker in the London Underground. Mick Jones played guitar in protopunk band London SS, which rehearsed for much of 1975 without ever playing a live show and recording only a single demo. London SS was managed by Bernard Rhodes, a sometime associate of impresario Malcolm McLaren and a friend of the members of the McLaren-managed band, the Sex Pistols. Jones and his bandmates became friendly with Sex Pistols Glen Matlock and Steve Jones, who would assist them as they tried out potential new members. Among those who auditioned for London SS without making the cut were Paul Simonon, who tried out as a vocalist, and drummer Terry Chimes. Nicky Headon drummed with the band for a week, then quit. After London SS broke up in early 1976, Rhodes continued as Jones's manager. In February, Jones saw the Sex Pistols perform for the first time: [...] "You knew straight away that was it, and this was what it <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> from now on. It was a new scene, new values—so different from what had happened before. A bit dangerous." [...] At the instigation of Rhodes, Jones contacted Simonon in March, suggesting he learn an instrument so he could join the new band Jones was organising. Soon Jones, Simonon on bass, Keith Levene on guitar and [...] "whoever we could find really to play the drums" [...] were rehearsing. Chimes was asked to audition for the new band and got the job, although he soon quit.|$|E

[...] The first scene Yates shot featured a giant interacting with human characters. The scene was the very first high-scale visual effects piece Yates filmed in his career. After the film's post-production material was well received by the studio, Yates was chosen to direct the sixth film, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, which according to Yates {{was going to be}} [...] "a cross between the chills of Prisoner of Azkaban [...] and the fantastical adventure of Goblet of Fire".|$|E

2500|$|On 3April 1937, Puyi's younger {{full brother}} Prince Pujie was proclaimed heir {{apparent}} after marrying Lady Hiro Saga, a distant cousin to the Japanese Emperor Hirohito. The marriage had been politically arranged by Shigeru Honjō, a {{general of the}} Kwantung Army. Puyi thereafter would not speak candidly {{in front of his}} brother and refused to eat any food provided by Lady Hiro Saga, believing that she was out to poison him. Puyi was forced to sign an agreement that if he himself had a male heir, the child would be sent to Japan to be raised by the Japanese. Puyi initially thought that Lady Saga was a Japanese spy, but came to trust her after the Sinophile Saga discarded her kimono dresses for cheongsam dresses and she repeatedly assured him that she come to the Salt Tax Palace because she was Pujie's wife, not because she was a spy. Behr described Lady Saga as [...] "intelligent" [...] and [...] "level-headed", and noted the irony of Puyi snubbing the one Japanese who really wanted to be his friend. A sign of improved relations came when Puyi gave Lady Saga a diamond encrusted watch as a belated wedding present. Later in April1937, a [...] 16year-old Manchu aristocrat Tan Yuling moved into the Salt Tax Palace to become Puyi's concubine, but though Puyi seemed to have liked her, it remains unclear whether he had sex with her or not. Lady Saga tried to improve relations between Puyi and Wanrong by having them eat dinner together, which {{was the first time that}} they had shared a meal in three years. Wanrong refused to eat with chopsticks, instead using her fingers, which is regarded as [...] "savage" [...] behavior in Asia, but Wanrong stated she was past the point of caring about what others thought about her. Puyi tried to joke away Wanrong's unhappiness by saying that tonight was [...] "Mongol night", and everyone <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> a Mongol [...] "savage" [...] by eating with their fingers, but Lady Saga noted his jesting failed.|$|E
