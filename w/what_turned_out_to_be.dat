5|$|In 1938, Fingleton made <b>what</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his {{international}} farewell as Australia toured England, {{a series}} {{in which he}} found runs difficult to come by. He later attributed this to his inability to play the pull shot. However, Fingleton started the tour well. He passed 30 {{in each of his}} first seven innings on English soil, and converted three of these starts into centuries, scoring 124 against Oxford University, 111 against Cambridge University and 123 not out against Hampshire in the first month of cricket. Fingleton's form tapered just at the wrong time, falling three times for single figures in the last two matches before the Tests. He carried this into the First Test at Trent Bridge, where he made only 9 and 40 in a high-scoring draw in which every innings passed 400.|$|E

Next year's World Championships at Moscow brought Thorkildsen a sixth place with a throw of 81.06 in <b>what</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his last appearance at a major championship competition.

5|$|In {{what was}} the first meeting as {{opposing}} head coaches between Nick Saban and his former assistant coach from both LSU and the Miami Dolphins, Will Muschamp, the Crimson Tide defeated the Florida Gators, 38–10 at The Swamp. After receiving the opening kickoff, Florida scored their only touchdown of the game on their first offensive play from scrimmage. The Gators took an early 7–0 lead when John Brantley threw a 65-yard touchdown pass to Andre Debose. Alabama responded on the following drive with Jeremy Shelley connecting on a 32-yard field goal to cut the Florida lead to 7–3. The Gators responded with <b>what</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> their final points of the game when Caleb Sturgis connected on a 21-yard field goal.

5|$|Scotland and Wales, {{having been}} drawn {{together}} in the same qualifying group for the 1986 World Cup, had been evenly matched throughout the competition, although Wales had secured a 1–0 win over Scotland in <b>what</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a controversial and bad-tempered game at Hampden Park in March 1985. This game, Wales' first win at Hampden for 34 years, saw Scottish complaints over {{what appeared to be a}} foul by Welsh striker Mark Hughes on defender Alex McLeish in the buildup to the goal scored by Ian Rush, and a clash between Scotland captain Graeme Souness and Welsh midfielder Peter Nicholas, for which both were booked, and which led to a number of the Welsh team surrounding the Scottish player. This booking would prove expensive as Souness was subsequently booked in Scotland's next qualifying game against Iceland, which led to him being suspended for the final qualifying game away to Wales.|$|E
5|$|In the January 2006 {{transfer}} window, {{he joined}} Grimsby Town on a two-year deal, {{three years after}} they first {{expressed an interest in}} signing him.

On 26 April 2006, Woodhouse said he planned to retire from football {{at the end of the}} 2005–06 season and embark on a career as a professional boxer. He made 16 appearances in League Two, helping them to finish fourth place, reaching the play-offs. Woodhouse played in both of Grimsby's play-off semi-final victories over Lincoln City, setting up the only goal of the game in the first leg. He played his last Football League game in the play-off final at the Millennium Stadium on 28 May 2006. Grimsby were defeated 1–0 in the final by Cheltenham Town. Woodhouse gave away a penalty in the 70th minute that was saved by goalkeeper Steve Mildenhall.|$|E

5|$|Only {{one species}} of Coelurus, the type species C. fragilis, is still {{recognized}} as valid today, although six other {{species have been}} named over the years. C. agilis, as discussed, was named by Marsh in 1884 for <b>what</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> additional parts of the skeleton of C. fragilis. Cope's C. bauri and C. longicollis, named in 1887 from Late Triassic fossils from New Mexico, were transferred by Cope in 1889 to his new genus Coelophysis. C. daviesi was named by Richard Lydekker in 1888 for Harry Seeley's Thecospondylus daviesi, a neck vertebra from the Early Cretaceous of England, but this species was later transferred to its own genus, Thecocoelurus. C. gracilis, another Early Cretaceous species, was also named in 1888. It was coined by Marsh for {{what seems to be}} an assortment of limb remains, but Gilmore could only find a single claw when he reviewed the species in 1920. This species has been proposed as outside Coelurus since the 1920s (when Gilmore assigned it to Chirostenotes), and has been regarded as a dubious species outside of Coelurus in recent reviews. Finally, during the period when Ornitholestes was thought to be the same as Coelurus, its type species was recognized as distinct by Steel, as C. hermanni.|$|E
5|$|The trio then {{proceeded}} to play together in the next match against Western Australia two weeks later and Merv captained the team as Hassett was away on Test duty. Victoria batted first and Neil came in to join Merv with the score at 2/102, and the pair added 173 together before the younger brother fell for 94. One run later, Merv was out for 141 in <b>what</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his final first-class century; later, Ray made only 1. Victoria ended on 370 and Western Australia took a 59-run lead. In the second innings, Merv made 6 and did not bat with his brothers. He declared the innings at 9/304, setting Western Australia a target of 246 for victory. They reached 5/205 and Victoria avoided defeat. A fortnight later, Harvey again captained the team and made a duck in his only innings in a rain-curtailed match. After the Victorians had made 412, Queensland reached 5/144 {{at the end of}} the match.

5|$|Healey {{played at}} centre forward for The North in an amateur trial match in February 1910; his side lost 3–2, {{and he was}} not {{selected}} for the upcoming fixtures.

Healey made his debut against the French national team at the Stade de Paris, opening the scoring as his team won 3–0, and scored again a couple of days later against Switzerland in a 4–1 win. His next involvement at international level was nearly a year later, against the Wales Amateur XI at the ground of his former club, Bishop Auckland, in February 1912. He was involved in the buildup to the second goal, scored by Sydney Sanders, and scored the third himself as England won 3–0. He was selected as a reserve for matches at home to the Netherlands and away to Belgium in March and April, but did not make his next, and <b>what</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> final, appearance until November against Belgium, in which he scored the second of England's four goals.
