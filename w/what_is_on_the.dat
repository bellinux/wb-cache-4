25|$|In 1971 Konstantīns Raudive wrote Breakthrough, {{detailing}} what {{he believed}} was the discovery of electronic voice phenomena (EVP). EVP {{has been described as}} auditory pareidolia. Allegations of backmasking in popular music, in which a listener claims a message has been recorded backward onto a track meant to be played forward, have also been described as auditory pareidolia. In 1995, the psychologist Diana Deutsch invented an algorithm for producing phantom words and phrases with the sounds coming from two stereo loudspeakers, with one to the listener's left and the other to his right. Each loudspeaker produces a phrase consisting of two words or syllables. The same sequence is presented repeatedly through both loudspeakers; however, they are offset in time so that one when the first sound (word or syllable) is coming from the speaker on the left, the second sound is coming from the speaker on the right, and vice versa. After listening for a while, phantom words and phrases suddenly emerge, and these often appear to reflect <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> listener's mind, and they transform perceptually into different words and phrases as the sequence continues.|$|E

500|$|The song's {{widespread}} {{success has}} made it indispensable to the band's live setlists and has been performed over 640 times since 1991 making it the band's second most performed song behind [...] "Give it Away". Unlike several of the Chili Peppers' other songs, [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] is not interpreted in a different manner than <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> record—aside from being played acoustically, the track is performed {{the same as it}} appears on Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Kiedis is, however, notorious for being incapable of achieving several high notes in live performances; the vocalist has noted that he sometimes forgets or rearranges song lyrics in the verses. Therefore, the song has sometimes suffered from his limitations as a singer. After being released as a single in March 1992, the song would be included in virtually all concerts; Frusciante, however, began to resent the song's popularity and would play convoluted intros, purposefully throwing Kiedis off. An example of this was during a televised performance on the highly rated program Saturday Night Live on February 22, 1992. Kiedis said that it [...] "felt like I was getting stabbed in the back and hung out to dry in front of all of America while [...] was off in a corner in the shadow, playing some dissonant out-of-tune experiment." [...] The guitarist used a distortion pedal for the ending verse and screamed incomprehensibly into the microphone when providing backup vocals, neither of which were originally planned or typical of live performances. Nevertheless, sales of Blood Sugar Sex Magik skyrocketed following the show.|$|E
500|$|Very {{soon after}} its initial release {{in the spring}} of 1968, several critics began championing the film in the UK and US. Robin Wood wrote that [...] "Witchfinder General is {{certainly}} [...] most successfully achieved work ... what one is immediately struck by is the assurance and intensity of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen... the English countryside is felt as a real presence: it is difficult to think of other films in which it has been used so sensitively and meaningfully. With it is associated Paul Ferris’ theme-music, which suggests a traditional air without being actual quotation. Against the peace and fertility of nature is set the depravity of men." [...] David Pirie, who wrote extensively and enthusiastically about the film in his 1973 book A Heritage of Horror, reviewed the film in 1971 for Time Out, commenting: [...] "...one of the most personal and mature statements in the history of British cinema... The performances are generally excellent, and no film before or since has used the British countryside in quite the same way." [...] Danny Peary noted, [...] "The Conqueror Worm is a stunning film in many ways, but probably Reeves's greatest achievement is {{that he was able to}} maintain an extraordinary momentum throughout, until the film ends as it began, with a woman (this time Sara) screaming." [...] In 2000, Derek Malcolm included Witchfinder General as part of his series The Century of Films, a list of what he considered to be the one hundred most [...] "artistically or culturally important" [...] movies of the 20th Century. Malcolm asserted that the film [...] "is one of the most compulsively watchable ever made in Britain" [...] and [...] "transcends its genre with the sheer panache of its making." [...] In 2005, J. Hoberman of the Village Voice stated that the film [...] "...has long been a cult item– in part because its talented 25-year-old director, Michael Reeves, died of a drug overdose before [...] the film's release, but mainly because it is an extraordinarily bleak story of political evil... Reeves shot on location and the movie has a robust autumnal quality perfectly matched by Price's overripe performance... it remains contemporary, and even frightening, in its evocation of cynical Puritanism and mass deception." ...|$|E

2500|$|The legendary Foster Hewitt, who had {{developed}} a style that welcomed Canadians to the radio broadcast each week, proved that his radio style could also work in the new medium of television in 1952. His move from radio to television was successful and Hewitt continued to work in television for many years, including the famed 1972 [...] "Summit Series" [...] between a team representing Canada (an NHL all-star team) and the Soviet National Team. This style of play-by-play announcers in hockey broadcasting really hasn't changed between radio and TV, as broadcasters still describe the action as if viewers cannot see <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen they're watching. Hewitt was followed (in no particular order) by Danny Gallivan, Dan Kelly, Dick Irvin, Jr., Jim Robson, Bob Cole, Hewitt's son, Bill Hewitt, and Jim Hughson. Previous show hosts included Wes McKnight, Ward Cornell, Jack Dennett, Ted Darling, Dave Hodge and George Stroumboulopoulos.|$|E
2500|$|The late Egyptologist, Frank Yurco, {{visited the}} tomb of Ramses III (KV11), and in a 1996 article on the Ramses III tomb reliefs {{he pointed out that}} the {{depiction}} of plate 48 in the Ergänzungsband section is not a correct depiction of what is actually painted {{on the walls of the}} tomb. Yurco notes, instead, that plate 48 is a [...] "pastiche" [...] of samples of <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tomb walls, arranged from Lepsius's notes after his death, and that a picture of a Nubian person has erroneously been labeled in the pastiche as an Egyptian person. Yurco points also to the much more recent photographs of Dr. Erik Hornung as a correct depiction of the actual paintings. (Erik Hornung, The Valley of the Kings: Horizon of Eternity, 1990). Ampim nonetheless continues to claim that plate 48 shows accurately the images that stand on the walls of KV11, and he categorically accuses both Yurco and Hornung of perpetrating a deliberate deception for the purposes of misleading the public about the true race of the ancient Egyptians.|$|E

2500|$|The song's initial {{concept was}} based on a lyric draft Jackson had written and discovered, which she thought would be {{suitable}} for the film's theme. Jackson stated [...] "it really tells you about the movie and how it doesn't matter <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> exterior, but the interior. His heart, his soul, that really matters to me. That's what I'm in love with, that's what matters to me the most, and it doesn't matter what other people say." [...] Following its release, Jackson stated [...] "I really liked that song a lot," [...] adding it was [...] "fun" [...] and [...] "a good summer song." [...] Jackson felt unsure of how the song would fare, but was pleased with its success. An unmastered version leaked and received airplay ahead of its scheduled release, followed by a positive response from critics and fans. Several radio stations created their own edits until the official version was released, prompting producer Jimmy Jam to exclaim [...] "That's wonderful, because it means radio is excited about it." [...] The song's success was likened to Jackson's return to a more positive and upbeat style in comparison to the bleak aura of The Velvet Rope, saying [...] "In the history of Janet, the records that are the happy records, that make people smile, have always traditionally been the more successful records, going back as far to songs like 'When I Think of You' to 'Doesn't Really Matter.'" ...|$|E
