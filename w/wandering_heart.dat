60|$|What {{sort of a}} man was Wakefield? We {{are free}} to shape out our own idea and call it by his name. He was now in the {{meridian}} of life; his matrimonial affections, never violent, were sobered into a calm, habitual sentiment; of all husbands, he {{was likely to be}} the most constant, because a certain sluggishness would keep his heart at rest wherever it might be placed. He was intellectual, but not actively so; his mind occupied itself in long and lazy musings that tended to no purpose or had not vigor to attain it; his thoughts were seldom so energetic as to seize hold of words. Imagination, in the proper meaning of the term, made no part of Wakefield's gifts. With a cold but not depraved nor <b>wandering</b> <b>heart,</b> and a mind never feverish with riotous thoughts nor perplexed with originality, who could have anticipated that our friend would entitle himself to a foremost place among the doers of eccentric deeds? Had his acquaintances been asked who was the man in London the surest to perform nothing to-day which should be remembered on the morrow, they would have thought of Wakefield. Only the wife of his bosom might have hesitated. She, without having analyzed his character, was partly aware of a quiet selfishness that had rusted into his inactive mind; of a peculiar sort of vanity, the most uneasy attribute about him; of a disposition to craft which had seldom produced more positive effects than the keeping of petty secrets hardly worth revealing; and, lastly, of what she called a little strangeness sometimes in the good man. This latter quality is indefinable, and perhaps non-existent.|$|E

It is also that psychic space in which we consider our loneliness, our <b>wandering</b> <b>hearts,</b> our unpacked boxes, our vulgar desires. In Queer Optimism: Lyric Personhood and Other Felicitous Persuasions (Minnesota, 2007), Michael Snediker worked “in the interests of felicity” to undermine {{the ways in which}} queer theory customarily privileges shame and melancholy. Here, in his first full-length collection of poetry, he undertakes a similar upending of expectation, acknowledging “gay sadness” but refusing to fall fully under its sway. The demi-tragedies of daily life are recounted by a voice that is variously wistful, giddy, bawdy, silly, and tart. Along the way, Michael Snediker sets off an impressive pyrotechnic display of literary allusion, drawing on the superstars of the Western canon (think: Virgil, Racine, Proust, James, Wharton, Tennessee Williams) and of popular culture (Lucille Ball, John Travolta, Alex Trebek). Buyer beware: In these pages you will not find advice on how to feng shui your duplex or tame a Cuisinart run amok. Instead, you will find something far rarer: a book of poetic sustenance.

6000|$|Say, lovely youth, that dost {{my heart}} command, Can Phaon's eyes forget his Sappho's hand? Must then her name the wretched writer prove, To thy remembrance lost, as to thy love? Ask {{not the cause}} that I new numbers choose, The lute {{neglected}} and the lyric Muse; Love taught my tears in sadder notes to flow, And tuned my heart to elegies of woe, I burn, I burn, as when through ripen'd corn By driving winds the spreading flames are borne! [...] 10 Phaon to Ætna's scorching fields retires, While I consume with more than Ætna's fires! No more my soul a charm in music finds; Music has charms alone for peaceful minds. Soft scenes of solitude no more can please; Love enters there, and I'm my own disease. No more the Lesbian dames my passion move, Once the dear objects of my guilty love; All other loves are lost in only thine, Ah, youth ungrateful to a flame like mine! [...] 20 Whom would not all those blooming charms surprise, Those heavenly looks, and dear deluding eyes! The harp and bow would you like Phoebus bear, A brighter Phoebus Phaon might appear; Would you with ivy wreath your flowing hair, Not Bacchus' self with Phaon could compare: Yet Phoebus loved, and Bacchus felt the flame, One Daphne warm'd, and one the Cretan dame; Nymphs that in verse no more could rival me, Than e'en those gods contend in charms with thee. [...] 30 The Muses teach me all their softest lays, And the wide world resounds with Sappho's praise. Though great Alcaeus more sublimely sings, And strikes with bolder rage the sounding strings, No less renown attends the moving lyre, Which Venus tunes, and all her loves inspire. To me what nature has in charms denied, Is well by wit's more lasting flames supplied. Though short my stature, yet my name extends To heaven itself, and earth's remotest ends. [...] 40 Brown as I am, an Ethiopian dame Inspired young Perseus with a generous flame; Turtles and doves of different hues unite, And glossy jet is pair'd with shining white. If to no charms thou wilt thy heart resign, But such as merit, such as equal thine, By none, alas! by none thou canst be moved, Phaon alone by Phaon must be loved! Yet once thy Sappho could thy cares employ, Once in her arms you centred all your joy: [...] 50 No time the dear remembrance can remove, For, oh! how vast a memory has love! My music, then, you could for ever hear, And all my words were music to your ear. You stopp'd with kisses my enchanting tongue, And found my kisses sweeter than my song, In all I pleased, but most in what was best; And the last joy was dearer than the rest. Then with each word, each glance, each motion fired, You still enjoy'd, and yet you still desired, [...] 60 Till, all dissolving, in the trance we lay, And in tumultuous raptures died away. The fair Sicilians now thy soul inflame; Why was I born, ye gods, a Lesbian dame? But ah, beware, Sicilian nymphs! nor boast That <b>wandering</b> <b>heart</b> which I so lately lost; Nor be with all those tempting words abused, Those tempting words were all to Sappho used. And you that rule Sicilia's happy plains, Have pity, Venus, on your poet's pains! [...] 70 Shall fortune still in one sad tenor run, And still increase the woes so soon begun? Inured to sorrow from my tender years, My parents' ashes drank my early tears: My brother next, neglecting wealth and fame, Ignobly burn'd in a destructive flame: An infant daughter late my griefs increased, And all a mother's cares distract my breast, Alas! what more could Fate itself impose, But thee, the last, and greatest of my woes? [...] 80 No more my robes in waving purple flow, Nor on my hand the sparkling diamonds glow; No more my locks in ringlets curl'd diffuse The costly sweetness of Arabian dews, Nor braids of gold the varied tresses bind, That fly disorder'd with the wanton wind: For whom should Sappho use such arts as these? He's gone, whom only she desired to please! Cupid's light darts my tender bosom move; Still is there cause for Sappho still to love: [...] 90 So from my birth the Sisters fix'd my doom, And gave to Venus all my life to come; Or, while my Muse in melting notes complains, My yielding heart keeps measure to my strains. By charms like thine, which all my soul have won, Who might not--ah! who would not be undone? For those Aurora Cephalus might scorn, And with fresh blushes paint the conscious morn. For those might Cynthia lengthen Phaon's sleep; And bid Endymion nightly tend his sheep; [...] 100 Venus for those had rapt thee to the skies; But Mars on thee might look with Venus' eyes. Oh scarce a youth, yet scarce a tender boy! Oh useful time for lovers to employ! Pride of thy age, and glory of thy race, Come to these arms, and melt in this embrace! The vows you never will return, receive; And take, at least, the love you will not give. See, while I write, my words are lost in tears! The less my sense, the more my love appears. [...] 110 Sure 'twas not much to bid one kind adieu, (At least to feign was never hard to you) 'Farewell, my Lesbian love,' you might have said; Or coldly thus, 'Farewell, O Lesbian maid!' No tear did you, no parting kiss receive, Nor knew I then how much I was to grieve. No lover's gift your Sappho could confer, And wrongs and woes were all you left with her. No charge I gave you, and no charge could give, But this, 'Be mindful of our loves, and live.' [...] 120 Now by the Nine, those powers adored by me, And Love, the god that ever waits on thee, When first I heard (from whom I hardly knew) That you were fled, and all my joys with you, Like some sad statue, speechless, pale, I stood, Grief chill'd my breast, and stopp'd my freezing blood; No sigh to rise, no tear had power to flow, Fix'd in a stupid lethargy of woe: But when its way the impetuous passion found, I rend my tresses, and my breast I wound: [...] 130 I rave, then weep; I curse, and then complain; Now swell to rage, now melt in tears again. Not fiercer pangs distract the mournful dame, Whose first-born infant feeds the funeral flame. My scornful brother with a smile appears, Insults my woes, and triumphs in my tears; His hated image ever haunts my eyes; 'And why this grief? thy daughter lives!' he cries. Stung with my love, and furious with despair, All torn my garments, and my bosom bare, [...] 140 My woes, thy crimes, I to the world proclaim; Such inconsistent things are love and shame! 'Tis thou art all my care and my delight, My daily longing, and my dream by night; Oh night more pleasing than the brightest day, When fancy gives what absence takes away, And, dress'd in all its visionary charms, Restores my fair deserter to my arms! Then round your neck in wanton wreaths I twine, Then you, methinks, as fondly circle mine: [...] 150 A thousand tender words I hear and speak; A thousand melting kisses give and take: Then fiercer joys, I blush to mention these, Yet, while I blush, confess how much they please. But when, with day, the sweet delusions fly, And all things wake to life and joy but I, As if once more forsaken, I complain, And close my eyes to dream of you again: Then frantic rise, and like some Fury rove Through lonely plains, and through the silent grove; [...] 160 As if the silent grove, and lonely plains, That knew my pleasures, could relieve my pains. I view the grotto, once the scene of love, The rocks around, the hanging roofs above, That charm'd me more, with native moss o'ergrown, Than Phrygian marble, or the Parian stone; I find the shades that veil'd our joys before; But, Phaon gone, those shades delight no more. Here the press'd herbs with bending tops betray Where oft entwined in amorous folds we lay; [...] 170 I kiss that earth which once was press'd by you, And all with tears the withering herbs bedew. For thee the fading trees appear to mourn, And birds defer their songs till thy return: Night shades the groves, and all in silence lie, All but the mournful Philomel and I: With mournful Philomel I join my strain, Of Tereus she, of Phaon I complain.|$|E

But where others would have found affliction, he had consolation, and where they would have lain desperate and squalid, he marched elate and ready to strike the stars. [...] "Never," [...] he says, [...] "did I think so much, exist so much, be myself so much, as in the journeys that I have made alone and on foot.

The sight of the country, the succession of agreeable views, open air, good appetite, {{the freedom of the}} alehouse, the absence of everything that could make me feel dependence, or recall me to my situation--all this sets my soul free, gives me a greater boldness of thought. I dispose of all nature as its sovereign lord; my <b>heart,</b> <b>wandering</b> from object to object, mingles and is one with the things that soothe it, wraps itself up in charming images, and is intoxicated by delicious sentiment. Ideas come as they please, not as I please: they do not come at all, or they come in a crowd, overwhelming me with their number and their force. When I came to a place I only thought of eating, and when I left it I only thought of walking. I felt that a new paradise awaited me at the door, and I thought of nothing but of hastening in search of it."[65] ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a series of}} readings of poems by John Keats (1795 - 1821), and traces through his work {{the idea of a}} self-sensing subject, engaged in a complex relationship both with orders and with its environment. Keats’s imagined subject is singular but contingent, and contests the unshareable condition of being with the affective claims of love and grief. This proposition is explored through Keats’s poetry and with recourse to a range of philosophical and theoretical thinkers, most particularly Immanuel Kant, Martin Heidegger, Gilles Deleuze, Jacques Derrida and Jean-Luc Nancy. Attending to some familiar and other less known works by Keats, the thesis develops chapters exploring the nature of touch, the evocation of presence, the poetics of ecology, the pursuit of freedom and the weight of grief. The thesis interlaces poetic and philosophical material in order to trace a trajectory from a Kantian subject around whom the world forms, to a Heideggerian world in which being takes place constitutively with others. The thesis culminates in a reading of Keats’s Hyperion poems, and draws from them a conception of post-apocalyptic care in which the world and the subjects that dwell upon it are endangered by and entrusted to each other. The thesis has three objectives. First, it presents new readings of Keats’s work. Second, it explores the possibility of a method of critical reading in the present where old poems are allowed to resonate in a contemporary moment. Lastly, the thesis draws from the method of close reading a sense of the particular phenomenality of Keats’s verse (his evocation of touching hands, <b>wandering</b> feet, beating <b>hearts,</b> breathing bodies, and an elemental world of air, water and stone) and proposes that the irreducibly singular ‘life of sensations’ is also thoughtful and committed to the affective claims made by and between human beings.

60|$|One fine May {{morning a}} long time after Hanrahan had left Margaret Rooney's house, he was walking the road near Collooney, {{and the sound of the}} birds singing in the bushes that were white with blossom set him singing as he went. It was to his own little place he was going, that was no more than a cabin, but that pleased him well. For he was tired of so many years of {{wandering}} from shelter to shelter at all times of the year, and although he was seldom refused a welcome and a share of what was in the house, it seemed to him sometimes that his mind was getting stiff like his joints, and it was not so easy to him as it used to be to make fun and sport through the night, and to set all the boys laughing with his pleasant talk, and to coax the women with his songs. And a while ago, he had turned into a cabin that some poor man had left to go harvesting and had never come to again. And when he had mended the thatch and made a bed in the corner with a few sacks and bushes, and had swept out the floor, he was well content to have a little place for himself, where he could go in and out as he liked, and put his head in his hands through the length of an evening if the fret was on him, and loneliness after the old times. One by one the neighbours began to send their children in to get some learning from him, and with what they brought, a few eggs or an oaten cake or a couple of sods of turf, he made out a way of living. And if he went for a wild day and night now and again to the Burrough, no one would say a word, knowing him to be a poet, with <b>wandering</b> in his <b>heart.</b>|$|R
60|$|First: I have {{personally}} known three {{instances where}} a whale, {{after receiving a}} harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by the same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same private cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I think {{it may have been}} something more than that; the man who darted them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other common perils incident to <b>wandering</b> in the <b>heart</b> of unknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose. This man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the other. I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so fell out that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the last time distinctly recognized a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whale's eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I say three years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are three instances, then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach.|$|R
500|$|Tony Norman of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette {{praised the}} episode, {{which he said}} [...] "has <b>wandered</b> into the <b>heart</b> of Dostoyevsky {{territory}} with its storylines". He particularly praised the episode for going outside its normal conventions by portraying lead characters like Pembleton and Gee as being so reluctant {{to do the right}} thing. Alan Pergament of The Buffalo News gave the episode four out of five stars; he particularly praised the performances of Thorne and Gerety, and said the show did an impressive job of introducing the new cast members. Michael Storey of Arkansas Democrat-Gazette said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] lived up to the high standards he said the show had set for itself. Ron Miller of Fort Worth Star-Telegram praised [...] "Blood Ties", although he said he does not always enjoy Homicide: Life on the Street. He said the episode [...] "starts fast and gets better and more intense by the minute", and described the climactic argument in the second episode as [...] "the most turbulent internal dispute we've ever seen among the detectives". Rocky Mountain News writer Dusty Saunders praised the main story-line and said the subplots were well juxtaposed into the episode. He also said [...] "Blood Ties" [...] could serve as a good introduction to the series for new viewers. Alan Sepinwall, television critic for The Star-Ledger, criticized the addition of [...] "silly" [...] action-oriented scenes the traditionally more intelligent show, but praised [...] "Blood Ties" [...] and the addition of the new cast members. Sepinwall particularly praised the acting of Andre Braugher: [...] "Pitted against a powerhouse like James Earl Jones, he not only holds his own, but at times is so dramatically forceful that the former voice of Darth Vader sounds intimidated." [...] Not all reviews of [...] "Blood Ties" [...] were positive. Joanne Ostrow of The Denver Post said the series benefited from the new characters, but that the episode [...] "asks viewers to believe rather too strongly in the inherent racism of certain characters we've come to know as heroes in seasons past". Ostrow also thought Pembleton's clashes with the new detectives was predictable.|$|R

Of course, {{if he can get}} the real air, the real trees, even for an hour, let him take it, in God's name; but how many a man who cannot spare time for a daily country walk, may well slip into the National Gallery in Trafalgar Square (or the South Kensington Museum), or any other {{collection}} of pictures, for ten minutes. That garden, at least, flowers as gaily in winter as in summer. Those noble faces on the wall are never disfigured by grief or passion. There, {{in the space of a}} single room, the townsman may take his country walk--a walk beneath mountain peaks, blushing sunsets, with broad woodlands spreading out below it; a walk through green meadows, under cool mellow shades, and overhanging rocks, by rushing brooks, where he watches and watches till he seems to hear the foam whisper, and to see the fishes leap; and his hard worn <b>heart</b> <b>wanders</b> out free, beyond the grim city-world of stone and iron, smoky chimneys, and roaring wheels, into the world of beautiful things--the world which shall be hereafter--ay, which shall be! Believe it, toil-worn worker, in spite of thy foul alley, thy crowded lodging, thy grimed clothing, thy ill-fed children, thy thin, pale wife--believe it, thou too and thine, will some day have your share of beauty. God made you love beautiful things only because He intends hereafter to give you your fill of them. That pictured face on the wall is lovely, but lovelier still may the wife of thy bosom be when she meets thee on the resurrection morn! Those baby cherubs in the old Italian painting--how gracefully they flutter and sport among the soft clouds, full of rich young life and baby joy! Yes, beautiful indeed, but just such a one at this very moment is that once pining, deformed child of thine, over whose death-cradle thou wast weeping a month ago; now a child-angel, whom thou shalt meet again never to part! Those landscapes, too, painted by loving, wise old Claude, two hundred years ago, are still as fresh as ever. How still the meadows are! how pure and free that vault of deep blue sky! No wonder that thy worn heart, as thou lookest, sighs aloud, [...] "Oh that I had wings as a dove, then would I flee away and be at rest." [...] Ah, but gayer meadows and bluer skies await thee in the world to come--that fairy-land made real--"the new heavens and the new earth," [...] which God has prepared for the pure and the loving, the just and the brave, who have conquered in this sore fight of life! ...|$|R
6000|$|The other {{quarter of}} the Campagna has wider fields and {{smoother}} turf and perhaps {{a greater number of}} delightful rides; the earth is sounder, and there are fewer pitfalls and ditches. The land for the most part lies higher and catches more wind, and the grass is here and there for great stretches as smooth and level as a carpet. You have no Alban Mountains before you, but you have in the distance the waving ridge of the nearer Apennines, and west of them, along the course of the Tiber, the long seaward level of deep-coloured fields, deepening as they recede to the blue and purple of the sea itself. Beyond them, of a very clear day, you may see the glitter of the Mediterranean. These are the occasions perhaps to remember most fondly, for they lead you to enchanting nooks, and the landscape has details of the highest refinement. Indeed when my sense reverts to the lingering impressions of so blest a time, it seems a fool's errand to have attempted to express them, and a waste of words to do more than recommend the reader to go citywards at twilight of the end of March, making for Porta Cavalleggieri, and note what he sees. At this hour the Campagna is to the last point its melancholy self, and I remember roadside [...] "effects" [...] of a strange and intense suggestiveness. Certain mean, mouldering villas behind grass- grown courts have an indefinably sinister look; there was one in especial of which it was impossible not to argue that a despairing creature must have once committed suicide there, behind bolted door and barred window, and that no one has since had the pluck to go in and see why he never came out. Every wayside mark of manners, of history, every stamp of the past in the country about Rome, touches my sense to a thrill, and I may thus exaggerate the appeal of very common things. This is the more likely because the appeal seems ever to rise out of heaven knows what depths of ancient trouble. To delight in the aspects of sentient ruin might appear a heartless pastime, and the pleasure, I confess, shows the note of perversity. The sombre and the hard are as common an influence from southern things as the soft and the bright, I think; sadness rarely fails to assault a northern observer when he misses what he takes for comfort. Beauty is no compensation for the loss, only making it more poignant. Enough beauty of climate hangs over these Roman cottages and farm-houses--beauty of light, of atmosphere and of vegetation; but their charm for the maker-out of the stories in things is the way the golden air shows off their desolation. Man lives more with Nature in Italy than in New or than in Old England; she does more work for him and gives him more holidays than in our short-summered climes, and his home is therefore much more bare of devices for helping him to do without her, forget her and forgive her. These reflections are perhaps the source of the character you find in a moss-coated stone stairway climbing outside of a wall; in a queer inner court, befouled with rubbish and drearily bare of convenience; in an ancient quaintly carven well, worked with infinite labour from an overhanging window; in an arbour of time-twisted vines under which you may sit with your feet in the dirt and remember as a dim fable that there are races for which the type of domestic allurement is the parlour hearth- rug. For reasons apparent or otherwise these things amuse me beyond expression, and I am never weary of staring into gateways, of lingering by dreary, shabby, half-barbaric farm-yards, of feasting a foolish gaze on sun-cracked plaster and unctuous indoor shadows. I mustn't forget, however, that it's not for wayside effects that one rides away behind St. Peter's, but for the strong sense of wandering over boundless space, of seeing great classic lines of landscape, of watching them dispose themselves into pictures so full of [...] "style" [...] that you can think of no painter who deserves to have you admit that they suggest him-- hardly knowing whether it is better pleasure to gallop far and drink deep of air and grassy distance and the whole delicious opportunity, or to walk and pause and linger, and try and grasp some ineffaceable memory of sky and colour and outline. Your pace can hardly help falling into a contemplative measure at the time, everywhere so wonderful, but in Rome so persuasively divine, when the winter begins palpably to soften and quicken. Far out on the Campagna, early in February, you feel the first vague earthly emanations, which in a few weeks come <b>wandering</b> into the <b>heart</b> of the city and throbbing through the close, dark streets. Springtime in Rome is an immensely poetic affair; but you must stand often far out in the ancient waste, between grass and sky, to measure its deep, full, steadily accelerated rhythm. The winter has an incontestable beauty, and is pre-eminently the time of colour--the time when it is no affectation, but homely verity, to talk about the [...] "purple" [...] tone of the atmosphere. As February comes and goes your purple is streaked with green and the rich, dark bloom of the distance begins to lose its intensity. But your loss is made up by other gains; none more precious than that inestimable gain to the ear--the disembodied voice of the lark. It comes with the early flowers, the white narcissus and the cyclamen, the half-buried violets and the pale anemones, and makes the whole atmosphere ring like a vault of tinkling glass. You never see the source of the sound, and are utterly unable to localise his note, which seems to come from everywhere at once, to be some hundred-throated voice of the air. Sometimes you fancy you just catch him, a mere vague spot against the blue, an intenser throb in the universal pulsation of light. As the weeks go on the flowers multiply and the deep blues and purples of the hills, turning to azure and violet, creep higher toward the narrowing snow-line of the Sabines. The temperature rises, the first hour of your ride you feel the heat, but you beguile it with brushing the hawthorn-blossoms as you pass along the hedges, and catching at the wild rose and honeysuckle; and when you get into the meadows there is stir enough in the air to lighten the dead weight of the sun. The Roman air, however, is not a tonic medicine, and it seldom suffers exercise to be all exhilarating. It has always seemed to me indeed part of the charm of the latter that your keenest consciousness is haunted with a vague languor. Occasionally when the sirocco blows that sensation becomes strange and exquisite. Then, under the grey sky, before the dim distances which the south-wind mostly brings with it, you seem to ride forth into a world from which all hope has departed and in which, in spite of the flowers that make your horse's footfalls soundless, nothing is left save some queer probability that your imagination is unable to measure, but from which it hardly shrinks. This quality in the Roman element may now and then [...] "relax" [...] you almost to ecstasy; but a season of sirocco would be an overdose of morbid pleasure. You may at any rate best feel the peculiar beauty of the Campagna on those mild days of winter when the mere quality and temper of the sunshine suffice to move the landscape to joy, and you pause on the brown grass in the sunny stillness and, by listening long enough, almost fancy you hear the shrill of the midsummer cricket. It is detail and ornament that vary from month to month, from week to week even, and make your returns to the same places a constant feast of unexpectedness; but the great essential features of the prospect preserve throughout the year the same impressive serenity. Soracte, be it January or May, rises from its blue horizon like an island from the sea and with an elegance of contour which no mood of the year can deepen or diminish. You know it well; you have seen it often in the mellow backgrounds of Claude; and it has such an irresistibly classic, academic air that while you look at it you begin to take your saddle for a faded old arm- chair in a palace gallery. A month's rides in different directions will show you a dozen prime Claudes. After I had seen them all I went piously to the Doria gallery to refresh my memory of its two famous specimens and to enjoy to the utmost their delightful air of reference to something that had become a part of my personal experience. Delightful it certainly is to feel the common element in one's own sensibility and those of a genius whom that element has helped to do great things. Claude must have haunted the very places of one's personal preference and adjusted their divine undulations to his splendid scheme of romance, his view of the poetry of life. He was familiar with aspects in which there wasn't a single uncompromising line. I saw a few days ago a small finished sketch from his hand, in the possession of an American artist, which was almost startling in its clear reflection of forms unaltered by the two centuries that have dimmed and cracked the paint and canvas.|$|R
