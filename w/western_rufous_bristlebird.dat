50|$|The <b>rufous</b> <b>bristlebird</b> (Dasyornis broadbenti) is one {{of three}} extant species of bristlebirds. It is endemic to Australia where three {{subspecies}} have been described from coastal southwestern Western Australia, southeastern South Australia and southwestern Victoria.

40|$|The <b>Rufous</b> <b>Bristlebird</b> Dasyornis broadbenti is a ground-dwelling {{bird that}} {{is listed as}} nearthreatened (Lower Risk) in Victoria. The species has been {{observed}} {{in a variety of}} habitats ranging from thickets of shrubs in coastal gullies, shrubland and heathlands on limestone cliffs to sheltered gullies. This study aimed to assess the distribution and habitat preferences of a population of the species in Portland, southwest Victoria. Monthly surveys were conducted on foot in the study area for one hour following sunrise and one hour prior to sunset, and bird presence was recorded on the basis of calls and sightings. Observations outside of the survey times were also recorded to determine habitat utilisation. Vegetation floristics and structure and food availability were measured in areas where birds were present as well as surrounding areas where they were absent to determine habitat preferences. A population size of between 45 and 60 individuals was estimated in the 200 ha study area. Bird presence was significantly positively correlated with increasing vegetation density. No significant associations were found between <b>Rufous</b> <b>Bristlebird</b> presence and the floristic associations. Although <b>Rufous</b> <b>Bristlebirds</b> occupy a variety of vegetation communities, results indicate that the key common factor appears to be structure of the vegetation.

40|$|A {{study to}} assess distribution, numbers and habitat of the <b>Rufous</b> <b>Bristlebird</b> was {{conducted}} during 1997 and 1998 {{along the coast}} at Aireys Inlet, Victoria. Monthly surveys were conducted along selected pathways for 1 h at sunrise, noon and late afternoon. Birds were recorded {{on the basis of}} sightings and calls; 75 % of records were from calls. The number of records of birds for April–June was significantly lower than for January–March, July–September and October–December. There was no difference in frequency of records due to weather conditions (clear, overcast or rain), presence of wind or difference in temperature. The <b>Rufous</b> <b>Bristlebird</b> inhabited remnant coastal vegetation, but also utilised nearby house gardens and road verges. Birds appeared to occupy distinct territories, with each separate territory occuring along a narrow strip of land on the coastal cliffs. The number of territories identified ranged from 14 to 33. Territories were occupied predominantly by pairs of birds. The minimum number of birds present was estimated for each survey session and ranged from 2 to 34. A conservative estimate of the bristlebird population in the area, {{based on the assumption that}} a territory was occupied by a pair, was thus between 28 and 66. A number of threats to the <b>Rufous</b> <b>Bristlebird</b> were identified in the study area including loss and fragmentation of habitat from housing developments and walking tracks.

50|$|Bristlebirds are long-tailed, sedentary, ground-frequenting birds. They vary {{in length}} from about 17 cm to 27 cm, with the eastern bristlebird the smallest, and the <b>rufous</b> <b>bristlebird</b> the largest, species.

40|$|Copyright © 2004 CSIROA strong {{pattern has}} emerged between {{sedentary}} behaviour and song sharing between territorial neighbours for avian species that possess song repertoires. This paper investigates song-repertoire size, {{and rates of}} song sharing and type matching, in the <b>Rufous</b> <b>Bristlebird</b> (Dasyornis broadbenti), a southern Australian species {{for which there is}} strong evidence for sedentary and territorial behaviour. For 12 focal individuals (6 male, 6 female), estimated mean repertoire size was 31 song types for male birds, and 14 song types for females, recorded {{at the start of the}} breeding season. While the female song was similar in structure to the final phase of the male song, there was no sharing of song types between the sexes. A high degree of song sharing was exhibited in both sexes, with males sharing an average of 65 % of song types, and females sharing 59 % of song types, with immediate territorial neighbours. These rates of song sharing between neighbours were significantly greater than rates of song sharing between non-neighbouring individuals, although common song types between non-neighbours were encountered. Furthermore, bristlebirds used these common song types significantly more often than song types that were unique to their repertoires. While male neighbours preferentially matched song types, there was no evidence for repertoire matching. The degree of song sharing in neighbouring <b>Rufous</b> <b>Bristlebirds</b> is therefore consistent with the observed relationship between sedentary behaviour and high levels of song sharing.

40|$|Wildlife {{managers}} are often {{faced with the}} difficult task of determining the distribution of species, and their preferred habitats, at large spatial scales. This task is even more challenging when the species of concern is in low abundance and/or the terrain is largely inaccessible. Spatially explicit distribution models, derived from multivariate statistical analyses and implemented in a geographic information system (GIS), can be used to predict the distributions of species and their habitats, thus making them a useful conservation tool. We present two such models: one for a dasyurid, the Swamp Antechinus (Antechinus minimus), and the other for a ground-dwelling bird, the <b>Rufous</b> <b>Bristlebird</b> (Dasyornis broadbenti), both of which are rare species occurring in the coastal heathlands of south-western Victoria. Models were generated using generalized linear modelling (GLM) techniques with species presence or absence as the independent variable and a series of landscape variables derived from GIS layers and high-resolution imagery as the predictors. The most parsimonious model, based on the Akaike Information Criterion, for each species then was extrapolated spatially in a GIS. Probability of species presence was used as an index of habitat suitability. Because habitat fragmentation is thought {{to be one of the}} major threats to these species, an assessment of the spatial distribution of suitable habitat across the landscape is vital in prescribing management actions to prevent further habitat fragmentation. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Copyright © 2003 CSIROThis work {{investigated}} {{whether the}} songs of the <b>rufous</b> <b>bristlebird,</b> Dasyornis broadbenti, vary between populations that have become isolated through habitat clearance, {{in a similar way}} to that found between island populations of other bird species, separated by ocean. In addition, the extent of song variation between the two extant subspecies of D. broadbenti was investigated. The nature of song elements did not differ between isolated sites within each subspecies' distribution more than between sites sampled within continuous populations. However, multivariate analyses of spectral and temporal features suggested that these features differed between isolated populations more than within continuous populations. In addition, both the nature of song elements and spectral and temporal features differed significantly between the two extant subspecies of D. broadbenti. These taxonomic analyses of song thus supported recent revisions of the subspecific boundaries of D. broadbenti. While there was some evidence that temporal and spectral song features varied more between isolated populations than within a continuous population, it was difficult to eliminate the effect of distance on song variation. Although evidence for song variation as a result of isolation was not strong for this species, clearance of the habitat utilised by D. broadbenti is relatively recent. The suggestion that communication systems of animal populations can be disrupted following isolation through habitat clearance is one that warrants further investigation, especially in taxa with older histories of fragmentation. This study also highlighted the potential for using behavioural information to assist with taxonomic investigations. Daniel James Roger...|$|R
40|$|The <b>Rufous</b> <b>Bristlebird</b> (Dasyornis broadbenti) is a sedentary, ground-dwelling {{passerine}} {{of southern}} Australia, which {{is listed as}} nationally vulnerable, and as near-threatened (lower risk) in Victoria. The species inhabits a variety of vegetation, including shrub thickets in coastal gullies to heathlands on limestone cliffs. This study aimed to assess the size, distribution and habitat use of a population of the subspecies D. b.   broadbenti at Portland in south-western Victoria. Monthly surveys (2002 – 03) were conducted on foot for 1 h after official sunrise and 1 h before official sunset, and presence of Bristlebirds recorded using vocalisations and sightings. Observations outside of the survey times were also recorded to estimate the size of territories and core area of occupancy. To quantify habitat preferences, vegetation composition and structure were measured in areas where Bristlebirds were present, as well as surrounding areas where they were not detected. The population in the survey areas was estimated at between 70 and 86 individuals in the 170 -ha survey area. The estimated size of territories of eight selected pairs of Bristlebirds ranged from 0. 5 to 3 ha, with core areas of occupancy ranging from 0. 2 to 0. 6 ha. During the nesting season (August November) Bristlebirds were detected at greater frequencies in the core area of occupancy within each territory. Significant associations {{were found between the}} presence of Bristlebirds and floristic associations dominated by the native environmental weeds Acacia sophorae and Leptospermum laevigatum. Bristlebird presence was significantly positively correlated with increasing vegetation density in the mid-canopy level (80 – 120 cm) indicating that vegetation structure is a key factor in habitat use. <br /...|$|R

Species that declined after logging (Golden Whistler, White-naped Honeyeater) foraged in the canopy and displayed little flexibility in foraging behavior. Species that did not decline (<b>Western</b> Yellow Robin, <b>Rufous</b> Treecreeper) foraged lower, spent a variable proportion {{of time on the}} ground and displayed greater flexibility in foraging behavior. Rufous Treecreepers, obligate tree-hollow nesters, and Western Yellow Robins did not alter nesting sites after logging, but Golden Whistlers nested infrequently in logged areas. There were no consistent differences in the nesting ecologies of the two groups, and it is unclear why Golden Whistlers nested infrequently in logged forest. Western Yellow Robins and Rufous Treecreepers used logged forest as frequently after logging as before and did not appear to require unlogged buffers to persist in forests used for timber production. In contrast, Golden Whistlers used logged forests less frequently after logging and moved their territories to include unlogged buffers. Retention of critical resources for Golden Whistlers and White-naped Honeyeaters in logged forest is unlikely to be feasible because of the effects on timber yield, emphasizing the importance of unlogged buffers in forest management...|$|R
40|$|In Nebraska, {{the species}} of hummingbird {{most likely to}} be seen, and indeed the only one likely to be seen in the eastern half of the state, is the ruby-throated hummingbird. This is the most widely {{distributed}} of all North American hummingbirds, and its breeding range covers virtually all of eastern North America north nearly to Hudson Bay. The nesting range includes most of eastern Nebraska, but only along the Missouri River is nesting at all regular. Nests have been reported as far west as North Platte. Ruby-throats typically arrive in Nebraska in early April, with about half of the total available spring records occurring between May 5 and 17. By June most of these birds will have continued northward, to return again in August during the fall migration. Typically, birds leave in mid September. In mild falls, stragglers may persist until early October. Although ruby-throats have been,reported as far west in Nebraska as Scotts Bluff County, bird watchers in the Panhandle should be on the alert for other species as well.

40|$|Background: Whether or not animals habituate to {{repeated}} exposure to predator scents may depend upon {{whether there are}} predators associated with the cues. Understanding the contexts of habituation is theoretically important and has profound implication {{for the application of}} predator-based herbivore deterrents. We repeatedly exposed a mixed mob of macropod marsupials to olfactory scents (urine, feces) from a sympatric predator (Canis lupus dingo), along with a control (water).

Finally, we scored non-invasive indicators (flight and alarm stomps) to determine whether fear or altered palatability was responsible for the response. Repeated exposure reduced macropodid foraging on food associated with 40 ml of dingo urine, X = 986. 75 ± 3. 97 g food remained as compared to the tap water control, X = 209. 0 ± 107. 0 g (P 0. 5).
