50|$|It is {{important}} that the wet areas of a bathroom be waterproof, and multiple layers of waterproofing can be employed. Grout is used to fill gaps between tiles, but grout and tile setting materials are generally porous. Tiles are generally waterproof, though a shower pan must be installed beneath them as a safety to prevent water leakage. Thus small mosaic tiles offer less of a defense than large format tiles. Sub-tile waterproofing {{is important}} when tiles are being used.

The material tested was boron nitride (BN), the water-repellent properties of which was detailed in our other investigation. Two different methods, chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD), were used to prepare the BN films on a fused quartz substrate (one of the components of thermal protection systems on aerospace vehicles). The deposited films were characterized by a variety of techniques including X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. The BN films were observed to be amorphous in nature, and a CVD-deposited film yielded a contact angle of 60 degrees with water, similar to the pellet BN samples investigated previously.

40|$|A sprayed {{waterproofing}} interlayer between {{primary and}} secondary tunnel linings {{has the potential to}} create composite structural interaction between them, mainly in circumferential flexure. This depends on the bond between sprayed surfaces and on the structural and chemical properties of the material. Data on bond is reviewed. Recent tests in tension, compression and shear to determine the structural properties of a particular elastomeric <b>waterproofing</b> <b>material</b> are presented, analysed and discussed. Values for Young’s modulus and the shear modulus G are proposed, for serviceability verifications that include limitation of crack width caused by excessive local flexure. It is concluded that where sufficient bond is present, composite action arising from transfer of circumferential shear between the linings can be relied upon to improve performance in service for short-term and accidental situations. This allows for reduction of stiffness during the first few years. There is no evidence from tests lasting up to 2. 2 years that significant further reduction would occur, but prediction of 100 -year performance remains difficult...|$|E

The quality of the product that can be produced by industry was evaluated according to the normative NBR 14. 810 : 2006, where density, thickness swell (TS), absorption, modulus of elasticity (MOE), modulus of rupture (MOR) in static bending and internal bond (IB) were determined. From the results, there was a decrease in TS and increase in MOR of coconut fiber panels with polyurethane resin panels compared with coconut fiber and resin urea-formaldehyde. Scanning microscopy electronic images (SEM) indicated that castor oil-based polyurethane adhesive occupies the gaps between the particles, a factor that contributes to improved physical and mechanical properties of the panels. The assessment of durability through accelerated aging tests shows that panels protected with <b>waterproofing</b> <b>material</b> can be used in environments that have contact with moisture.

40|$|Panels for {{openings}} in structures {{have always been}} an essential and integral part of buildings. Their importance {{in terms of a}} building´s functionality was not recognised. However, the general view on this issue has changed from focusing on big planar segments and critical details to sub-elements of these structures. This does not only focus on the forms of connecting joints but also on the supporting systems that keep the panels in the right position and ensure they function properly. One of the most strained segments is the threshold structure, especially the entrance door threshold structure. It is the part where substantial defects in construction occur in terms of waterproofing, {{as well as in the}} static, thermal and technical functions thereof. In conventional buildings, this problem is solved by pulling the floor structure under the entrance door structure and subsequently covering it with <b>waterproofing</b> <b>material.</b> This system cannot work effectively over the long term so local defects occur.
