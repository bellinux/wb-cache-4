50|$|The player's {{health and}} stamina are {{limiting}} factors on the field. The character's health is lost due to taking damage but can <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> by health potions. Stamina depletes with many actions including running or using their weapon, {{and if this}} runs low, the character will slow down or even stop until their stamina <b>is</b> <b>restored.</b> Stamina will <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> normally by doing less aggressive actions. The maximum stamina will drain over time, and though some can <b>be</b> <b>restored</b> through various health items, low stamina can limit the player's effectiveness on the field.|$|R
