5|$|In the {{programming}} language AspectJ, pointcuts, join points, and the modularized code are defined in an aspect block {{similar to that}} of Java classes. Classes are defined using Java syntax.

The DSL Debugging Framework (DDF) generates debuggers automatically from DSL grammar specifications. The debugging concern is <b>weaved</b> <b>into</b> a base grammar in an aspect-oriented style. DDF {{was used to}} generate debuggers for three different types of DSLs (imperative, declarative, and hybrid) that are translated into a General Purpose Language (GPL), such as Java. The demonstration will show how debugging concerns are <b>weaved</b> <b>into</b> the base grammar of a hybrid DSL to generate a debugger. The generated debugger will be demonstrated on a DSL for describing GUIs. Key words: AOP, Debugging, DSL, Grammar...|$|R

5|$|When the College {{first opened}} in 1888 {{there was no}} uniform, instead the girls wore long cotton dresses, gloves and hat. A straw boater was {{introduced}} in the early 20th century, worn with a red and white hat band featuring the college crest with its burning bush <b>woven</b> <b>into</b> it in red. During this time Prefects wore red silk arm-bands embroidered with a gold crest.|$|E
5|$|Fiberglass is a fiber {{reinforced}} polymer made {{of plastic}} reinforced by glass fibers, commonly <b>woven</b> <b>into</b> a mat. The glass fibers used in the material are made of various types of glass depending upon the fiberglass use. These glasses all contain silica or silicate, with varying amounts of oxides of calcium, magnesium, and sometimes boron. The boron is present as borosilicate, borax, or boron oxide, and is added to increase {{the strength of the}} glass, or as a fluxing agent to decrease the melting temperature of silica, which is too high to be easily worked in its pure form to make glass fibers.|$|E
5|$|Many motifs {{are used}} in {{traditional}} kilims, handmade flat-woven rugs, each with many variations. In Turkish Anatolia in particular, village women wove themes significant for their lives into their rugs, whether before marriage or during married life. Some motifs represent desires, such as for happiness and children; others, for protection against threats such as wolves (to the flocks) and scorpions, or against the evil eye. These motifs were often combined when <b>woven</b> <b>into</b> patterns on kilims. With the fading of tribal and village cultures in the 20th century, the meaning of kilim patterns has faded also.|$|E

5|$|Other {{theories}} include André Chastagnol's minimalist {{opinion that}} the author was a pagan who supported the Senate and the Roman aristocracy and scorned the lower classes and the barbarian races, while François Paschoud proposed that the last books of the History are in fact a type of alternative historical narrative, with events and the personalities of recent 4th century emperors <b>woven</b> <b>into</b> the fabric {{of a series of}} 3rd century emperors. According to Paschoud, the representation of the emperor Probus is in fact a version of Julian, with Carus substituting for Valentinian I and Carinus for Gratian.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{staples of}} the Maya diet were maize, beans, and squashes. These were {{supplemented}} {{with a wide}} variety of other plants either cultivated in gardens or gathered in the forest. At Joya de Cerén, a volcanic eruption preserved a record of foodstuffs stored in Maya homes, among them were chilies and tomatoes. Cotton seeds were in the process of being ground, perhaps to produce cooking oil. In addition to basic foodstuffs, the Maya also cultivated prestige crops such as cotton, cacao and vanilla. Cacao was especially prized by the elite, who consumed chocolate beverages. Cotton was spun, dyed, and <b>woven</b> <b>into</b> valuable textiles in order to be traded.|$|E
5|$|He is {{critical}} of greed for gold, such as the absurdity of using the metal for coins in the early Republic. He gives examples of the way rulers proclaimed their prowess by exhibiting gold looted from their campaigns, such as that by Claudius after conquering Britain, and tells the stories of Midas and Croesus. He discusses why gold is unique in its malleability and ductility, far greater than any other metal. The examples given are its ability to be beaten into fine foil with just one ounce, producing 750 leaves four inches square. Fine gold wire can be <b>woven</b> <b>into</b> cloth, although imperial clothes usually combined it with natural fibres like wool. He once saw Agrippina the Younger, wife of Claudius, at a public show on the Fucine Lake involving a naval battle, wearing a military cloak made of gold. He rejects Herodotus's claims of Indian gold obtained by ants or dug up by griffins in Scythia.|$|E
50|$|Hand beaters {{must have}} enough mass {{to force the}} <b>weaving</b> <b>into</b> place, so they {{come in a variety}} of weights and sizes. Some may have lead inserts to provide {{additional}} heft for a smaller beater, and some are made entirely from metal.|$|R
5|$|By the 17th century, Canterbury's {{population}} was 5,000; of whom 2,000 were French-speaking Protestant Huguenots, who had begun fleeing persecution and {{war in the}} Spanish Netherlands in the mid-16th century.
