2500|$|Hawaii {{has had a}} {{long history}} of queer identities. Māhū people, who often traversed gender as defined by Western standards, were a {{respected}} group of pre-colonization people who were widely known in society as healers. Another Hawaiian word, aikāne, referred to same-sex relationships. According to journals written by Captain Cook's crew, it is widely believed that many alii engaged in aikāne relationships. Hawaiian scholar Lilikalā Kameeleihiwa said, [...] "If you didn't sleep with a man, how could you trust him <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> into battle? How would you know {{if he was going to}} be the warrior that would protect you at all costs, if he wasn't your lover?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically {{the songs}} {{reflected}} {{the world of}} an average young teenager, no longer a child but not yet an adult, and his personal development; the dreams, hopes and desires {{as well as the}} fears and frustrations, infatuation and rejection ("När du kommer", [...] "Räcker jag till"), existential ponderings ("Universum", [...] "Snurra du min värld", [...] "Gitarren och jag") alongside typical adolescent fantasies and daydreams of historical figures like the Vikings ("Viking"), [...] "Buffalo Bill", Goliath ("Goliat från Gat") or becoming a super hero like [...] "The Phantom" [...] ("Fantomen"), and naturally, as with most teenagers, also playful hints at an increased interest in the opposite sex. His Melodifestivalen entry [...] "Oh vilken härlig dag" [...] for instance includes phrases like [...] "I snuck down to the lake, to spy on you <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>went</b> skinnydipping" [...] and [...] "I ran naked in the blazing sun" [...] and most importantly [...] "And I could see what you're hiding under your skirt"; a line that was considered particularly risqué when sung by a seventeen-year-old boy in the pre-selections for the Eurovision Song Contest in 1973. Despite the fact that all lyrics were the work of Ted's eight-year-older brother Kenneth and not Ted himself, they were specifically written to reflect Ted's personality and his world, and the feelings of a teenager, not those of his older brother.|$|E
