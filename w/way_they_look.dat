5|$|Leroux {{was one of}} 21 {{professional}} athletes featured in ESPN's The Body Issue in 2013. She appeared semi-nude on one of eight covers for the magazine. Of the experience she said, I {{think a lot of}} females struggle with the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>look,</b> and I wanted to show that everyone's body is different. I think it's a big deal to be an athlete and feel confident in your body and show it off. I'm not going to say I've never struggled with how I look, but I've reached a point in my life where I'm happy with who I am.|$|E
25|$|From October 2005 to April 2006, Ensler toured twenty North American {{cities with}} her play The Good Body, {{following}} engagements on Broadway, at ACT in San Francisco, {{and in a}} workshop production at Seattle Repertory Theatre. The Good Body addresses why women of many cultures and backgrounds perceive pressure to change the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> {{in order to be}} accepted in the eyes of society.|$|E
25|$|Males {{also face}} similar burdens {{in regards to}} attractiveness, whereby the media’s {{depiction}} of the ideal muscular physique has caused numerous body dissatisfaction issues amongst young men Teenage boys in particular, are now {{three times more likely}} to suffer from Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD), with numbers reaching 45% since 1991. BDD is a mental illness whereby an individual compulsively focuses on physical self-perceived flaws. According to a study by Rawhide, 18% of adolescent males were most worried about their weight and physique (Malcore, 2016), while 29% frequently thought about their appearances. Moreover, 50% had recently complained about the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>look.</b> The main causes of male body issues on the other hand, include 25% being teased about their weight, while 33% specified social media as the source for self-consciousness. A number of respondents also admitted to being affected by negative body talk from others.|$|E

60|$|Again {{there was}} a consultation, and the old {{fisherman}} told them how they might reach Bay St. Louis, a town of considerable importance on Mississippi Sound.

500|$|During {{the casting}} process, Shannon was {{compared}} to Paris Hilton, and Lost producer Damon Lindelof described her as a [...] "bitch. She is like a typical spoiled daddy's girl who gets whatever she wants and is not responsible to the slightest bit." [...] Eirik Knutzen of The Repository found Shannon to be [...] "a self-centered twit," [...] and she was also called a [...] "spoiled daddy's girl." [...] Boone describes her as a [...] "self-centered little bitch." [...] On her first night on the Island, Shannon is confident they will be rescued, refusing to help the others organize the luggage. She does not care Rose (L. Scott Caldwell) has lost her husband, and spends {{much of her time}} sunbathing. She manipulates Charlie (Dominic Monaghan) into catching a fish for her, after which Boone apologizes on behalf of Shannon for [...] "using this poor guy like [...] use everyone else." [...] In [...] "Whatever the Case May Be," [...] Boone says to Shannon, [...] "Don't you see the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> at us around here? They don't take us seriously. We're a joke. I'm trying to contribute something. You're just – you're useless." [...] This motivates her to help Sayid translate maps he obtained from Rousseau.|$|E
2500|$|In North America, {{since the}} redress victory in 1988, a {{significant}} evolutionary change has occurred.

2500|$|Robert Barnard {{wrote of}} the book in 1980: [...] "Lively, with {{occasional}} glimpses of a Vile Bodies world, though one short on Waugh's anarchic humour and long on snobbery ('Nobody looks at a chauffeur the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> at a person'). Weakened by lack of proper detective: the investigating pair are bumbling amateurs, {{with more than a}} touch of Tommy and Tuppence" ...|$|E
5000|$|Beth Shalom (lit. [...] "House of Peace") is a Holocaust {{memorial}} centre near Laxton in Nottinghamshire in England. Opened in 1995, it is England's only Holocaust museum. The centre {{was founded}} by brothers James and Stephen Smith following a 1991 visit to Israel during which a trip to Yad Vashem changed the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> at history and the Holocaust.|$|R
5000|$|Williams {{collaborated with}} Supra on the [...] "Estaban" [...] {{signature}} shoe model {{that will be}} released in July 2014. Williams explained in a June 25, 2014 interview: [...] "This is without a doubt my most style-driven and innovative design since my first pro shoe ... Growing up, I’d always wear three-quarter length mid tops. They’re the most stylish to me. The <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> when I skated, with my jeans, when I was hanging out, <b>they</b> always <b>looked</b> the best." ...|$|R
5|$|Actors {{and crew}} used their iPhones to {{communicate}} and store information such as the script—that <b>way,</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> like guests casually using their phones. The phones were also used to record sound, in addition to digital recorders taped to each actor's body that were left running all day. For day scenes, Moore felt comfortable risking {{only three or four}} takes of each scene, but found he could do more at night.|$|R
2500|$|Despite their {{differences}} in social status, the group begins to form friendships {{as the day}} progresses. Claire gives Allison a makeover, to reveal just how pretty she really is, which sparks romantic interest in Andrew. Claire decides to break her [...] "pristine" [...] virgin appearance by kissing Bender {{in the closet and}} giving him a hickey. Although they suspect that the relationships will end with the end of their detention, their mutual experiences will change the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> at their peers afterwards.|$|E
2500|$|What {{they call}} [...] "Israel" [...] is no mere {{military}} state. A subsumed militarism, a systemic mendacity with an ingrained violence constitutional {{to the very}} fusion of its fabric, has penetrated the deepest corners of what these people have to call their [...] "soul."... Half a century of systematic maiming and murdering of another people has left its deep marks {{on the faces of}} these people, the way they talk, the way they walk, the way they handle objects, the way they greet each other, the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> at the world. There is an endemic prevarication to this machinery, a vulgarity of character that is bone-deep and structural to the skeletal vertebrae of its culture.|$|E
2500|$|Similar to Warhammer Fantasy Battle players, Lord of the Rings players {{commonly}} {{collect and}} paint one army (or more) {{of their choice}} and find opponents (with similarly collected armies) to play against. Armies can be built up from through the purchase of boxed sets (usually having 10 or 12 plastic miniatures in each) or [...] "blister packs" [...] (usually containing {{no more than four}} finely detailed metal or resin miniatures) to build up a reasonable-sized fighting force. Others simply collect the miniatures because they like the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>look.</b> One popular way of collecting was through Battle Games in Middle-earth — a De Agostini magazine that came with one or more free miniatures (some of which were initially exclusive to the publication) and contained detailed hobby guides.|$|E
50|$|He {{produced}} numerous genre {{paintings of}} people performing various daily tasks inside upper- and middle-class homes in Stockholm. Dresses and furniture were painted exactly the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> {{and provide a}} valuable {{source of information about}} what life was like in those days. In addition to this he painted craftsmen in action at mills and other early industrial workplaces. Between 1757 and 1772 he worked as a master tapestry weaver, after learning the trade in France.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes in {{different}} sets, the Miners appear {{different from the}} <b>way</b> <b>they</b> usually <b>look</b> (e.g. hair, different facial expression, different hat) {{but most of the}} time they appear the same.|$|R
50|$|Furthermore, {{this style}} of filmmaking suited the filmmaker's {{intuitive}} style perfectly, giving the film a surreal, otherworldly feel. As well as being out of literally out of synch, he also accentuated the oddness by mismatching the soundtrack with what you see - often you'll find sweet and innocent dialogue accompanying grotesque and sometimes violent visuals or a South Island kea screeching on a North Auckland road. He also enjoyed giving the actors voices that were incongruous with the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked.</b>|$|R
2500|$|While Griffin {{established}} {{her career}} with candid observations {{about everyday life}} and her dating experiences, later focusing on mainly mocking celebrities, her act currently consists of recounting embellished stories involving celebrities. Though her humor may be wicked, Griffin hopes people understand that no malice is intended by it. [...] "I'm genuinely a fan {{of most of the}} people I trash in the act," [...] said Griffin in an interview. [...] "I really, really try and focus on making fun of people for their behavior. I'm not so into making fun of someone for the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>look,</b> or something that's out of their control." [...] Her favorite celebrity topics are plastic surgery, Scientology, alcohol intoxication, substance abuse, snooty s, eating disorders, and stars whose sexual orientation is disputed. Among Griffin's staples are Paris Hilton, Clay Aiken, Barbara Walters, Whitney Houston, Larry David, Celine Dion, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jerry Seinfeld, Star Jones, Paula Abdul, Sharon Stone, Oprah Winfrey, Britney Spears, Ryan Seacrest, Lindsay Lohan, Miley and Billy Ray Cyrus, Bravo's The Real Housewives, Kirstie Alley, Sarah Palin, Michele Bachmann, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, Uma Thurman and Renée Zellweger.|$|E
2500|$|Near {{the end of}} the temple's garden, over a hill {{stands the}} Hansōbō, the temple's large tutelary Shinto shrine. The {{enshrined}} spirit is the Hansōbō Daigongen. The gongen was originally the tutelary spirit (...) of Hōkō-ji in Shizuoka and was brought here in 1890 by Aozora Kandō. The statues on the stairs leading to the shrine represent Tengu, entities similar to goblins which accompany the gongen. Some of the creatures have wings and a beak: they are a type of tengu called Karasu-tengu (crow tengu) because of the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>look.</b> On a clear day, from the shrine one can see Mount Fuji to the west, and Sagami bay and Izu Ōshima to the south. The stones in the garden are full of names: they are those of the faithful who donated to the temple, and which belong to over 100 different religious organizations. This area used to be the temple's Inner Sanctuary, which still stands among the trees {{at the very top of}} the hill and which can be reached going up the steep stairs that begin on the right of the shrine, in front of the Jizō-dō. Next to the sanctuary there's an observation deck from which, on clear days, are visible Kamakura, Yuigahama and Mount Fuji.|$|E

[...] Although Vandernoot and Kirsch are three years apart in age (Vandernoot being the older of the two), on set Vandernoot treated Kirsch like a young boy, while Kirsch seemed to her like a younger brother because of his {{youthful}} appearance.|$|R
40|$|This article {{serves as}} an {{introduction}} to the articles that follow, which examine questions of power and sensibility in four discrete <b>ways.</b> <b>They</b> <b>look</b> variously at the moral limits of international law, the extent to which power has been delegated to or asserted by the U. N. Security Council, the successes and failures of efforts at international criminal prosecution, and the challenge of applying the traditional laws of war {{in the context of a}} “Global War on Terror. ” This introduction outlines the various contributions that follow and sketches out some potential implications...|$|R

But whatever we do, wherever we go, you won't take him away from me, Jude dear? I could not let him go now! The cloud upon his young mind makes him so pathetic to me; I do hope to lift it some day! And he loves me so. You won't take him away from me?" ...|$|E

Have you never noticed, monsieur," [...] he continued, [...] "the difference? They do not plod here as do your English people. There is a buoyancy in their footsteps, a mirth in their laughter, an expectancy in the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> around, as though adventures were everywhere.

50|$|The çorape worn in {{the region}} of Rugova are usually white, but during the Ottoman {{presence}} they were most likely red. They were similar to those used in Montenegro for the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> would <b>look</b> on the inside and for the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> would be tied.|$|R

He is a detective, if you like to call him that, the master detective of the world. He has a great house in one of the {{backwater}} squares of New York, for his office. He has wireless telegraphy, private chemists, a little troop of spies, private telegraph and cable, and agents in every city of the world. If he moves against any gang, they break up. No one can really understand him. Sometimes he seems to be {{on the side of the}} law, sometimes on the side of the criminal. He takes just what cases he pleases, and a million dollars wouldn't tempt him to touch one he doesn't care about. Watch him go out. They say that you can almost tell the lives of the people he passes, from the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>look</b> at him.

5|$|In 2010, Letlive {{began writing}} on the third album.

During pre-production, the band listened to styles and ideas that, according to Butler, changed the <b>way</b> <b>they</b> <b>looked</b> at the songs they had initially written. The styles were their most expansive to date, and came from the diversity of their members: Butler had involved himself in the punk rock skateboarding culture when he was eleven, but had also been influenced by his father, {{who was in a}} soul band.|$|R
