5|$|The company DuPont {{and many}} {{industrial}} historians dispute {{a link between}} nylon and hemp.

As a commercial product, nylon was a revolution in textiles. Strong and water-resistant, it was possible to make very thin fibers from cheap raw materials. The first sales in 1938 in New York of nylon stockings created a line with 4000 middle class women. For years to come, nylon demand <b>was</b> <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> DuPont could produce.
