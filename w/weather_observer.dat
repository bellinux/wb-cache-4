25|$|On June 6, {{two days}} after the bombing of Dutch Harbor, 500 Japanese marines landed on Kiska, one of the Aleutian Islands of Alaska. Upon landing, they killed two and {{captured}} eight U.S. Navy officers, then took the remaining inhabitants of the island, and seized control of American soil for the first time. The next day, a total of 1,140 Japanese infantrymen landed on Attu via Holtz Bay, eventually reaching Massacre Bay and Chichagof Harbor. Attu's population at the time consisted of 45 Native American Aleuts, and two Americans - Charles Foster Jones, a 60-year-old ham radio operator and <b>weather</b> <b>observer,</b> and his 62-year-old wife Etta, a teacher and nurse. The Japanese killed Jones after interrogating him, while his wife and the Aleut population were sent to Japan. The invasion was only the second time that American soil had been occupied by a foreign enemy, the first being the British during the War of 1812.|$|E
500|$|Surface weather {{observations}} are the fundamental data used for safety {{as well as}} climatological reasons to forecast weather and issue warnings worldwide. They can be taken manually, by a <b>weather</b> <b>observer,</b> by computer {{through the use of}} automated weather stations, or in a hybrid scheme using weather observers to augment the otherwise automated weather station. The ICAO defines the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA), which is the model of the standard variation of pressure, temperature, density, and viscosity with altitude in the Earth's atmosphere, and is used to reduce a station pressure to sea level pressure. Airport observations can be transmitted worldwide through the use of the METAR observing code. Personal weather stations taking automated observations can transmit their data to the United States mesonet through the Citizen <b>Weather</b> <b>Observer</b> Program (CWOP), the UK Met Office through their Weather Observations Website (WOW), or internationally through the Weather Underground Internet site. [...] A thirty-year average of a location's weather observations is traditionally used to determine the station's climate.|$|E
50|$|The National Weather Service also {{maintains}} {{connections with}} privately operated mesonets {{such as the}} Citizen <b>Weather</b> <b>Observer</b> Program for data collection, in part, through the Meteorological Assimilated Data Ingest System (MADIS).
