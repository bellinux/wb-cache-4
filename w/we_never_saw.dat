500|$|Shortly after forming, {{they gave}} their first public {{performance}} on October 23, 1991, at the Quad of California State University, Northridge. The {{blueprint for the}} group's major-label debut album, demo tape Rage Against the Machine, was laid on a twelve-song self-released cassette, the cover image of which featured newspaper clippings of the stockmarket section with a single match taped to the inlay card. Not all 12 songs made it onto the final album—two were eventually included as B-sides, while three others never saw an official release. Several record labels expressed interest, and the band eventually signed with Epic Records. Morello said, [...] "Epic agreed to everything we asked—and they've followed through... <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> a [...] conflict {{as long as we}} maintained creative control." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1968, Wright {{commented on}} Pink Floyd's sonic reputation: [...] "It's {{hard to see}} why we were cast as the first British {{psychedelic}} group. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> ourselves that way... we realised that we were, after all, only playing for fun... tied to no particular form of music, we could do whatever we wanted... the emphasis... firmly on spontaneity and improvisation." [...] Waters gave a less enthusiastic assessment of the band's early sound: [...] "There wasn't anything 'grand' about it. We were laughable. We were useless. We couldn't play at all so we had to do something stupid and 'experimental'...Syd was a genius, but I wouldn't {{want to go back to}} playing [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] for hours and hours." [...] Unconstrained by conventional pop formats, Pink Floyd were innovators of progressive rock during the 1970s and ambient music during the 1980s.|$|E
500|$|The San'a Institute {{obtained}} an {{exit visa}} {{for him at}} his request, and arranged for a car that {{took him to the}} airport on September 21, 2009 (the day his student visa expired), but the school's director said, [...] "After that, <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> him again, and apparently he did not leave Yemen". In October, Abdulmutallab told his father via text message saying {{that he did not want}} to attend business school in Dubai, and wanted instead to study Islamic law and Arabic in Yemen. When his father refused to pay for it, Abdulmutallab said he was [...] "already getting everything for free". He text-messaged his father, saying [...] "I've found a new religion, the real Islam", [...] "You should just forget about me, I'm never coming back", and [...] "Forgive me for any wrongdoing, I am no longer your child". The family was last in contact with their son in October 2009.|$|E

60|$|He {{accompanied}} {{me to the}} steamboat, {{that was}} to carry me homeward; he stuck close to my side, till {{she was about to}} put off; then, standing on the wharf, he shook me by the hand, till we almost counteracted the play of the paddles; and at last, with a mutual jerk at the arm-pits, <b>we</b> parted. I <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> Harry again.|$|R
500|$|Raonic's {{coaching}} relationship evolved {{during his}} early professional years. Since late 2007, Raonic {{had been working}} with Tennis Canada coaches—including Guillaume Marx, Head Boys National Coach—based out of the National Training Centre at Jarry Park in Montreal. In November 2009, with Raonic's world ranking at No. 377, Tennis Canada hired recently retired former player Frédéric Niemeyer to coach Raonic and travel with him for 18 weeks during the 2010 season. Toward the end of 2010, however, Niemeyer decided to travel less owing to [...] "family considerations." [...] As a result, Tennis Canada arranged for a two-week trial period with former world No. 40 Galo Blanco in co-operation with Niemeyer, including tournaments in Malaysia and Japan in late September and early October. Over this period, Raonic climbed from No. 237 to No. 155. [...] Tennis Canada hired Blanco, and Raonic moved to Barcelona to train with Blanco and trainer Tony Estalella. Commenting on the training regiment, Blanco said [...] "the off-season Milos had this winter in Barcelona was amazing. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> anything like that before, working the way he worked for six weeks." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{was obvious}} that his {{drinking}} problem was getting worse. By this time, Bill and Martha fought {{all the time and}} she told him to stop drinking or move out. He then did move out into a room in their pool house. Martha still took care of him and sometimes he would come in the house to eat, but he ate very little. [...] "There were days <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> him," [...] said his daughter Martha Maria.|$|E
2500|$|On September 20, 1765, Antoine {{had killed}} his third large grey wolf {{measuring}} [...] high, [...] long, and weighing [...] The wolf, which was named Le Loup de Chazes after the nearby Abbaye des Chazes, {{was said to}} have been quite large for a wolf. Antoine officially stated: [...] "We declare by the present report signed from our hand, <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> a big wolf that could be compared to this one. Which is why we estimate this could be the fearsome beast that caused so much damage." [...] The animal was further identified as the culprit by attack survivors who recognised the scars on its body inflicted by victims defending themselves. The wolf was stuffed and sent to Versailles where Antoine was received as a hero, receiving a large sum of money as well as titles and awards.|$|E
6000|$|By {{this time}} Good {{had already begun}} his lessons with the handsomest of the three, and so with a sigh I yielded. That day {{everything}} went very well: the young ladies were certainly very clever, and they only smiled when <b>we</b> blundered. I <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> Good so attentive to his books before, and even Sir Henry appeared to tackle Zu-Vendi with a renewed zest. 'Ah,' thought I, 'will it always be thus?' ...|$|R
60|$|Thus {{ended the}} story of the coming of the Englishmen, and of how Ralph lost his wealth and rank. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> heard or <b>saw</b> more of them, seeing that in those days before the great Trek we did not write letters, and if we had we should not have known where to send them, nor did the post-cart pass the door twice a week as it does in this overcrowded land of Natal.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> {{you before}} now, and <b>we</b> <b>never</b> heard of Mary Lavelle,' {{said the man}} of the house. 'And who is she,' he said, 'and what is it you are talking about?' ...|$|R
2500|$|Samuel Reid, a {{volunteer}} from Louisiana, described McCulloch and his ranger company as [...] "men in groups with long beards and mustaches, dressed in every variety of garment, with one exception, the slouched hat, the unmistakable uniform of a Texas ranger, and a brace of pistols around their waists, [...] were occupied drying their blankets, cleaning and fixing their guns, and some employed cooking at different fires, {{while others were}} grooming their horses. A rougher-looking set <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw.</b> They were without tents, and a miserable shed afforded them the only shelter. Captain McCulloch introduced us to his officers {{and many of his}} men, who appeared orderly and well-mannered people. But from their rough exterior, {{it was hard to tell}} who or what they were. Notwithstanding their ferocious and outlaw look, there were among them doctors and lawyers and many a college graduate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Brando made {{a similar}} comment on Larry King Live in April 1996, saying [...] "Hollywood is run by Jews; it is owned by Jews, {{and they should have}} a greater {{sensitivity}} about the issue of—of people who are suffering. Because they've exploited—we have seen the—we have seen the nigger and greaseball, we've seen the chink, we've seen the slit-eyed dangerous Jap, we have seen the wily Filipino, we've seen everything, but <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> the kike. Because they knew perfectly well, that that is where you draw the wagons around." [...] Larry King, who is Jewish, replied, [...] "When you say—when you say something like that, you are playing right in, though, to anti-Semitic people who say the Jews are—" [...] Brando interrupted: [...] "No, no, because I will be the first one who will appraise the Jews honestly and say 'Thank God for the Jews'." ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2014, during PAX Australia, Bethesda officially {{cancelled}} Prey 2. Hines stated, [...] "It {{was a game}} {{we believed}} in, but we never felt that it got to where {{it needed to be}} –– <b>we</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> a path to success if we finished it. It wasn't up to our quality standard, and we decided to cancel it. It’s no longer in development. That wasn't an easy decision, but it’s one that won’t surprise many folks given that we hadn't been talking about it. Human Head Studios is no longer working on it. It's a franchise we still believe we can do something with — we just need to see what that something is." [...] Tim Gerritsen, business development director at Human Head Studios, said, [...] "While we are disappointed that we won’t be able to deliver our vision of the game, we remain proud of our work on the franchise, which we feel speaks for itself, including the award-winning presentation of the game at E3 2011. We enjoyed working with the many talented people at Bethesda, and we wish them all the best of luck with any future plans they may have for the franchise." ...|$|E
5000|$|Of the 1904 race, Edward Boeglin asked:Was Garin {{the subject}} of an injustice? It's not impossible. But the rigour of the {{sanctions}} {{can be explained by the}} discredit into which professional cycling had (already!) fallen. An example had to be made of a champion.Garin was incontestably the strongest rider of the period, so he was first choice. He was 34. The suspension for two years ... broke his career. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> again <b>saw</b> him at the front of the peloton 'this little and stubborn rider of formidable consistency ... who won all the races that mattered', ... "this rider, intelligent, crafty, instinctive and calculating, ... the little chimney sweep from Arvier, in the Aoste valley near Mont Blanc' Edouard Boeglin, Franco Cuaz. Garin also won the 1904 Tour de France, by a small margin over Lucien Pothier, but was subsequently stripped of the title which was awarded to Henri Cornet. The race aroused a passion among spectators, who felled trees to hold back rivals and beat up others at night outside St-Étienne. Garin was one of the mob's victims. Pierre Chany wrote: ...|$|R
60|$|Selecting a {{sheltered}} cove, {{which appeared to}} be at the mouth of a small creek, we beached the boat, and leaving two men to guard it started inland toward a grove of trees. Before we reached it an animal came out of it and advanced confidently toward us, showing no signs of either fear or hostility. It was a hideous creature, not altogether like anything that we had ever seen, but on its close approach we recognized it as a dog, of an unimaginably loathsome breed. As we were nearly famished one of the sailors shot it for food. Instantly a great crowd of persons, who had doubtless been watching us from among the trees, rushed upon us with fierce exclamations and surrounded us, making the most threatening gestures and brandishing unfamiliar weapons. Unable to resist such odds we were seized, bound with cords and dragged into the forest almost before we knew what had happened to us. Observing the nature of our reception the ship's crew hastily weighed anchor and sailed away. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> again <b>saw</b> them.|$|R
6000|$|To this I agreed. Together we loaned {{him enough}} to make the first payment on a small farm. He was deeply {{grateful}} for this and hope again sprang up in his heart. [...] "You won't regret it," [...] he said brokenly. [...] "This will put me on my feet, and by and by perhaps we'll meet in the old valley."--But <b>we</b> <b>never</b> did. I <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> him again.|$|R

5000|$|March 23, 2007 - DOJ {{releases}} records {{related to}} the controversy which challenge some of Gonzales's previous statements at the March 13 press conference. At that press conference he stated: [...] "I <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> documents. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> had a discussion about where things stood." [...] But DOJ records showed that on his November 27 schedule [...] "he attended an hour-long meeting at which, aides said, he approved a detailed plan for executing the purge.".|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} not; but I cannot help telling you. He thought I was unkind. I {{thought that he}} would go on from one trouble to another;--and he did.

[...] This he said, as he was walking across the hall to the drawing-room.|$|R
60|$|That {{was the end}} of that party. I <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> a party {{break up}} so quietly, and with so little fuss. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> said good-night even to one another. We came downstairs one at a time, walking softly, and keeping the shady side. We asked the servant for our hats and coats in whispers, and opened the door for ourselves, and slipped out, and got round the corner quickly, {{avoiding}} each other as much as possible.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps he {{may know}} nothing about it; he and Rice {{separated}} long ago, even before Grant became so famous. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> much of him, you know, after we came here. Suppose you leave him to ME. I'll see him." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> Mont Blanc at {{his best}} until we were many miles away; then he lifted his majestic {{proportions}} high into the heavens, all white and cold and solemn, and made {{the rest of the}} world seem little and plebeian, and cheap and trivial.|$|E
60|$|We {{passed the}} same group, accidentally, in the evening. <b>We</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> a ‘green’ so drunk, a lord so quarrelsome (no: {{not even in}} the house of peers after dinner), a pair of clowns so melancholy, a lady so muddy, or a party so miserable.|$|E
60|$|Under cool porticoes {{and through}} tall doorways are seen dark 'stores,' filled with {{all manner of}} good things from Britain or from the United States. These older-fashioned houses, built, I presume, on the Spanish model, are not without a certain stateliness, from the depth and breadth of their chiaroscuro. Their doors and windows reach almost to the ceiling, {{and ought to be}} plain proofs, in the eyes of certain discoverers of the 'giant cities of Bashan,' that the old Spanish and French colonists were nine or ten feet high apiece. On the doorsteps sit Negresses in gaudy print dresses, with stiff turbans (which are, {{according}} to this year's fashion, of chocolate and yellow silk plaid, painted with thick yellow paint, and cost in all some four dollars), all aiding in the general work of doing nothing: save where here and there a hugely fat Negress, possibly with her 'head tied across' in a white turban (sign of mourning), sells, or tries to sell, abominable sweetmeats, strange fruits, and junks of sugar-cane, to be gnawed by the dawdlers in mid-street, while they carry on their heads everything and anything, from half a barrow-load of yams to a saucer or a beer-bottle. <b>We</b> <b>never,</b> however, <b>saw,</b> as Tom Cringle did, a Negro carrying a burden on his chin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Uncle Silas, I am {{sure there}} are some things about our trip that <b>we</b> <b>never</b> told you.

And oh, I learned such a lot of French history. All about Francis the First, and Pa took me to see his chateaus along the Loire. Very few tourists go there. You really ought to have gone with us." ...|$|R
60|$|We {{went away}} from Manilla, {{in the island}} of Luconia, the 15th of August, 1714; and, sailing awhile to the southward, passed the Straits between that island and Mindora, another of the Philippines, where we met with little {{extraordinary}}, except extraordinary lightning and thunders, such as <b>we</b> <b>never</b> heard or <b>saw</b> before, though, it seems, it is very familiar in that climate; till, after sixteen days' sailing, we saw the isle of Guam, one of the Ladrones, or Islands of Thieves, for so much the word imports; here we came to an anchor, Sept. 3, under the lee of a steep shore, {{on the north side}} of the isle of Guam; but, as we wanted no trade here, we did not at first inquire after the chief port, or Spanish governor, or anything of that kind; but we changed our situation the next day, and went through the passage to the east side of the island, and came to an anchor near the town.|$|R

5000|$|On March 13, Gonzales {{stated in}} a news conference that he {{accepted}} responsibility for mistakes made in the dismissal and rejected calls for his resignation that Democratic members of Congress had been making.

5000|$|Kane {{conceived}} the character Savage, an espionage agent and troubleshooter, and developed {{the story and}} art. He based his protagonist visually on actor Lee Marvin, whom Kane {{had seen in the}} movie Point Blank. The resemblance was much more pointed on Robert Foster's photo-referenced painted cover, which was replaced by a new Kane illustration for the 1982 Fantagraphics reprint.
