500|$|The {{announcement}} of Kills' second studio album {{was made with}} the release of a music video for its first promotional single [...] "Controversy" [...] in mid-September 2012. During an interview with Glamour, Kills explained that it served as an introductory track to the album [...] "because it's a verbal collage of things <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>on</b> a daily basis that we turn a blind eye to, especially in the Internet age, where you can literally see anything and everything instantly. (...) We all laugh and joke when it's someone else's suffering." [...] The album's first single, [...] "Problem", was digitally released by Interscope in mid-March 2013, followed in June by its music video. In the same month, [...] "Saturday Night" [...] was chosen as Troubles second single. It received mostly positive reviews from music critics.|$|E
500|$|Chris Sokol, Bryan Sokol, and John Waldman {{all of the}} {{professional}} wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer reviewed the Impact! episodes involving the 2008 TNA World X Cup Tournament. For the first round, Chris said the bout between The Motor City Machine Guns and the team of Tyson Dux and Daivari [...] "was a really good match." [...] Meanwhile, Waldman reviewed the match between Team Japan and Team Mexico, in which he stated [...] "the action is fast paced and unlike anything <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>on</b> North American TV." [...] Bryan Sokol reviewed the first two standard matches of round two, with him commenting {{on the encounter between}} Bucanero and Koslov as being an [...] "overall quick match with not much to talk about", but did not give an opinion on the Milano Collection A.T. versus Curry Man bout. Bryan and Chris Sokol reviewed the last two standard matches of round two together, with them saying that the contest pitting Masato Yoshino against Doug Williams was a [...] "nice back and forth match." [...] Neither gave their opinion on Kaz versus Último Guerrero in their review.|$|E
500|$|Writing for USA Today, Brian Mansfield complimented {{the optimistic}} and [...] "self-assured" [...] {{nature of the}} song, adding that [...] "it's the sort of {{determined}} dance anthem Madonna does so well". The Dallas Morning News Hunter Hauk described the song as a [...] "solid melding" [...] of different club musics and appreciated the dance break, and Madonna's singing attitude, calling it [...] "less prickly or defiant than <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>on</b> Instagram these days". Jeff Miers from The Buffalo News compared [...] "Living for Love" [...] to earlier club anthems, songs which had become commercial success for Madonna. Writing for i-D, Nick Levine described the song as a [...] "perfectly-pitched comeback single: rather than returning with a cheap EDM banger... When she sings 'I picked up my crown, {{put it back on}} my head', it feels like a statement of intent." [...] Lewis Corner from Digital Spy listed it {{as one of the top}} ten tracks of the week, adding that the composition made it [...] "an euphoric first cut from... Rebel Heart". Jed Gottlieb from Boston Herald described the track's beats as contemporary, while found the chorus and the hooks to be reminiscent of [...] "old school" [...] Top 40 songs. [...] "True Blue fans will hear a joy and nostalgia in [...] ". Jon Pareles from The New York Times commended [...] "Living for Love"'s ability to transform [...] "the breakup emotions into an uplifting redemption". He called it [...] "one of Madonna's best singles in a decade". Writing for PopMatters, Lisi found the track to be Madonna's [...] "most joyous" [...] release since [...] "Express Yourself".|$|E

2500|$|On the {{negative}} side, Scott Mendelson of Forbes criticized the film {{for being too}} [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "gritty," [...] saying that the film lacked in humor or excitement, offering little nuance and little artistic interpretation beyond hitting the expected goal posts. He added, [...] "Ridley Scott’s Exodus: Gods and Kings is a terrible film. It is a badly acted and badly written melodrama that takes what should be a passionate and emotionally wrenching story and drains it of all life and all dramatic interest." [...] Pete Hammond of Deadline.com in his review said, [...] "Ridley Scott [...] do a plague well, and here, he gets to do 10 of them. But is this oh-so-familiar tale still fresh enough to get people into theaters in the droves needed to make back the very high production values that <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>on</b> screen?" [...] Alonso Duralde of The Wrap also gave a negative review and said, [...] "If you're going into Exodus: Gods and Kings thinking that director Ridley Scott {{is going to give}} the Moses story anything we didn't already get from Cecil B.

Kenyan Foreign Minister Moses Wetangula issued {{a statement to the}} delegations telling them to [...] "put aside your differences and realise that you have only one Congo, and that the international community is here with you to encourage and assist you. Please don't let Africa and your country down." [...] The talks, chaired by President Mwai Kibaki and attended by former President of Tanzania Benjamin Mkapa, who represented the African Union, were referred to as [...] "an opportunity that should neither be lost nor wasted" [...] by Obasanjo, who stated that [...] "A military solution is not an option. We appeal to your principles to make this dialogue a success." [...] Obasanjo went on to declare that the talks should accomplish a permanent cease-fire in eastern Congo, continued reinforcement of a corridor for humanitarian assistance in the region, and a lasting peace in Congo; he also praised the delegations for their efforts. Wetangula added, [...] "The pictures and clips we have been seeing on international TV screens remains a terrible indictment to all of us Africans, you Congolese in particular.

2500|$|Delany {{conceived}} and executed Dhalgren {{as a literary}} Multistable perception—the observer (reader) may choose to shift his perception back and forth. Central to this construction is the notebook itself: Kidd receives the notebook shortly after entering Bellona. In the first several chapters of the novel <b>we</b> <b>see,</b> <b>on</b> several occasions, exactly what Kid reads when {{he looks at the}} open notebook. The notebook appears to take over as the main text of the novel starting at Chapter VII, coming almost seamlessly after Chapter VI. However, though Chapter VII reads as though it is written by Kid, many of the passages shown in earlier chapters appear verbatim in Chapter VII. Yet for Kid to have read those passages earlier, the passages must have been written before he received the notebook. In fact, the last few pages of the novel show Kid leaving Bellona. The last sentence of that departure sequence is the incomplete one that conceivably loops {{back to the beginning of}} the book. However, earlier in the novel the notebook falls to the ground and Kid reads the last page. The reader sees exactly what Kid reads: the last four sentences of the novel, word for word. This happens well before a point in the novel where Kid specifically states that he only wrote the poems, and [...] "all that other stuff" [...] was already in there when he received the notebook. However, those four sentences are part of a longer section at the end of the novel which, when read, was obviously written by Kid. This means he left Bellona—taking the notebook with him, for how else would he be able to write about his departure—prior to that notebook being found inside Bellona and given to him. Delany has specifically stated that it is not a matter of settling or deciding which text is authoritative. It is more a matter of allowing the reader to experience perceptual shifts in the same way that a Necker cube can be viewed. Akin to the hints regarding its circular nature, Dhalgren also contains at least one hint towards the perceptual shifts: Denny's book of M. C. Escher prints. Additionally, Jeffrey Allen Tucker has written that Delany's unpublished notes regarding the writing of Dhalgren contain direct references to the novel itself working as a Moebius Strip, and makes a direct connection to Escher's [...] "Moebius Strip".|$|E
