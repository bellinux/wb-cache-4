5|$|I {{must confess}} that, like many others, I {{did not come}} painlessly to the Natural History. For years I was {{put off by the}} aura of {{sanctity}} and bluffness which seemed to surround it. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> book presented on prize-giving days, and I saw it as a work, in all senses, of the old school. Even when I eventually came to read it, I cannot say my opinion changed dramatically. I could not cope at first with its rambling disorder, its sudden plunges into thickets of taxonomic Latin, and, for a while, I failed to notice the feeling behind the often dispassionate prose.|$|E
25|$|Dange's major work, From Primitive Communism to Slavery was {{published}} in 1949. The book attempted to analyze stages of growth of society in ancient India. The author had painfully researched ancient scriptures and other sources {{to make it a}} definitive tome. Engels’ book The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> road map he used. He analyzed the ancient epics to arrive at the reasons for origin of private property in India. The first draft of the book was written in Yerwada Central Jail between October 1942 and January 1943.|$|E
25|$|Tom van Vollenhoven the brush-cut wing who {{appeared}} on the scene in 1955, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> player who captured the imagination every time he touched the ball. His try for the Light Blues against the Junior Springboks in 1955, when he beat one player after another in spectacular a zigzag run of almost 80 metres, is still lauded as the try of all tries. This got him into the Springbok side against the 1955 British Lions of Robin Thomson and in the second test scored a hat trick of tries. He would probably {{have been one of the}} greatest heroes if he had not gone off to play professional rugby league in England so early in his career.|$|E

25|$|In a 2004 episode, TC watched an NBC ad for Days of Our Lives on his TV, {{and went}} on to praise the writers of Days of our Lives for coming up with such good storylines; Days, at that time, was under the helm of James E. Reilly, head writer of Passions. In the September 4, 2006, episode, Fox was sucked into a black hole; he then told Tabitha that it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> black hole that one gets sucked into on the Sci Fi Channel, which was the channel on which Passions repeats aired in 2006. Tabitha then told him stick with NBC (Passions network). In an episode later in September 2006, Siren tried to get Miguel into bed by singing her Siren's song. Miguel told her that she should not {{audition}} for America's Got Talent, which airs on NBC. In another episode, Tabitha talked about The Biggest Loser season finale, which was also aired on NBC. A more recent episode featured characters watching a trailer for the 2007 Diane Keaton film Because I Said So (produced by Universal Studios, which, like NBC, is owned by General Electric).|$|E
25|$|Modern Archaeognatha and Thysanura {{still have}} {{rudimentary}} appendages on their abdomen called styli, while more primitive and extinct insects known as Monura {{had much more}} developed abdominal appendages. The abdominal and thoracic segments in the earliest terrestrial ancestor of the insects {{would have been more}} similar to each other than they are today, and the head had well-developed compound eyes and long antennae. Their body size is not known yet. As the most primitive group today, Archaeognatha, is most abundant near the coasts, it could mean that this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> habitat where the insect ancestors became terrestrial. But this specialization to coastal niches could also have a secondary origin, just as could their jumping locomotion, as it is the crawling Thysanura who are considered to be most original (plesiomorphic). By looking at how primitive cheliceratan book gills (still seen in horseshoe crabs) evolved into book lungs in primitive spiders and finally into tracheae in more advanced spiders (most of them still have a pair of book lungs intact as well), it is possible the trachea of insects was formed in a similar way, modifying gills at the base of their appendages.|$|E
25|$|A 'Welcome Home Ken Barrington' {{dance was}} {{arranged}} {{on his return}} from New Zealand where he was presented with a silver trophy to a standing ovation {{in front of the}} Surrey team. With the Ashes left in Australia the English press focused on Barrington's achievements and much was hoped for against the West Indies in 1963. Frank Worrell was the first full-time African-Caribbean cricketer to captain the West Indies and had a colourful team in the shape of Conrad Hunte, Rohan Kanhai, Gary Sobers, Basil Butcher, Lance Gibbs, Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith. Barrington made 110 not out against them for Surrey (the next highest score was 22) and joked that the Test match would be over in three days as England had gone 13 Tests against the West Indies without defeat. The First Test was a rude awakening as he was out for 16 and 8 and England lost by an innings. The Second Test at Lord's is one of the Great Tests; the West Indies made 301 and Barrington top scored with 80 in England's reply of 297. The West Indies were out for 229 in the second innings and England needed 234 to win. Barrington made 60, added 99 runs with Colin Cowdrey (whose arm was broken by Wes Hall) and Brian Close and hit Gibbs for a six followed by another onto the Lord's balcony. A last minute collapse left England 228/9 with Cowdrey returning to the crease in the last over with victory, defeat, a tie or a draw still possible. As it was Dave Allen played for a draw. Fred Trueman's 12/119 won the Third Test at Edgbaston, but Barrington made only 9 and 1, followed by 25, 32, 16 and 28 as Worrell's team won the last two Tests and the series 3–1. For all the excitement provided by the tourists it was a bad series for Barrington as this <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> cricket he had forsaken and his 275 runs (27.50) was less than what was expected of him. Even so, he published his first book with Phil Riley called Running in Hundreds, detailing his struggle to play for England and rise to fame.|$|E

[...] A supposed facsimile of this potsherd appeared in Haggard's first edition, and the ancient inscription it bore, once translated, led the English characters to She's ancient kingdom. Critics have compared this device to the Testament of Isildur in The Lord of the Rings and to Tolkien's efforts to produce as an illustration a realistic page from the Book of Mazarbul. Critics starting with Edwin Muir have found resemblances between Haggard's romances and Tolkien's.|$|E

And while Glee sometimes stretches to pick on-the-nose song choices, [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls" [...] was just a perfect choice and performance—not just on topic but actually in Puck's musical wheelhouse." ...|$|E

500|$|Although Kelly {{was raised}} as a Roman Catholic, he later {{described}} himself as a non-believer in any religion. He is the great great grandson of Jeremiah Kelly, who emigrated from Ireland in 1852 and settled in Clare, South Australia. His paternal grandfather, Francis Kelly, established a law firm in 1917, which his father, John, joined in 1937. John Kelly died in 1968 at the age of 52, after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease three years earlier. Paul Kelly was thirteen years old when his father died. Kelly described his father: [...] "I have good memories, he <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> father that, well, I missed him when he died very much.

500|$|Immediately after (Turn On) The Music Machine was released, {{the band}} left for another U.S. tour, despite pleas {{by the group}} to arrange an {{appearance}} at the Monterey Pop Festival. In the small off-periods in their hard-pressed schedule, the Music Machine demoed a new batch of Bonniwell originals at RCA Studios in New York City and Cosimo Matassa's facility in New Orleans, before polishing the tunes back in Los Angeles. From the sessions emerged the group's third single [...] "Double Yellow Line", which was released in April 1967, and bubbled under the Billboard Hot 100 at number 111. The subsequent release, [...] "Eagle Never Hunts the Fly" [...] failed to chart, but {{is often described as}} Bonniwell's tour de force—a tune Ross praised as [...] "sonically compelling works and a lot to listen to, for the time. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thing you just didn’t hear, you almost worried about getting those sounds onto a 45".|$|E
500|$|Although Safran {{initially}} {{intended the}} series {{to be an}} ensemble, with Alex the lead protagonist, this changed after Chopra was cast. As the show's [...] "face" [...] and featuring in its publicity campaign, Alex dominated the storyline and became the main character of the series. Although the character was initially written as Caucasian, Safran completely rewrote her character with Chopra in his mind, tweaking her background as she became half-Indian and spent ten years in Mumbai. Her casting also helped change Alex's personality; in one change, the [...] "jaded and brooding" [...] Alex became [...] "fun and warm". Safran initially focused on the character's dark side, {{saying that he had}} never imagined a positive side: [...] "Priyanka came in and played all of that but as a character who was always in control. And still warm and vibrant because she knew no one was going to get through her walls. From that point on, Alex <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> character who can have humor, who can have heart".|$|E

Records called Kiedis to congratulate him on the successful deal, and complimented the rival record label. Kiedis recalled of the situation: [...] "The coolest, most real person we had met during all these negotiations had just personally called to encourage me to make a great record for a rival company. That <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> guy I'd want to be working for." [...] The group pursued the idea, and eventually dropped the {{contract with}} Sony in favor of a deal with Warner Bros.
