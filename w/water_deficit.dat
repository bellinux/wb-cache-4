25|$|The National Water Strategy defines “water deficit” as “water demand” minus “water resources”. “Water demand” is {{not used}} in an {{economic}} sense where demand depends on price. Instead demand is defined as water needs derived from policy objectives. Thus the figure given in the strategy for water demand in agriculture - 1,080 million m3 (MCM)/year - is far greater than actual water use of about 600 MCM/year. In 2007, agriculture accounted for 72% of “water demand”, while the municipal share was 24% and the shares of tourism and industries were 3% and 1%, respectively. The <b>water</b> <b>deficit</b> of 565 million m3 (MCM)/year for 2007 thus is mainly caused by assumptions about “water needs” in agriculture.|$|E
25|$|The Syrian {{government}} has {{at various times}} considered two alternative mega-projects to bring additional water to the Greater Damascus area. One plan consisted in the transfer {{of water from the}} coastal region over a distance of at least 225km and a cumulated difference in altitude of about 1000m. The water sources considered were two reservoirs in the coastal basin and even offshore springs in the Mediterranean or desalination of seawater at a total cost of more than US$1 per cubic meter including its transfer. By 2010 this plan was considered to have been abandoned. The other plan consists in building a pipeline from the Euphrates River. In 2006 Syrian officials said they were “pressing ahead” with a feasibility study by a Swiss company to transfer water from the Euphrates to Damascus at an estimated cost of US$2 billion. The project would involve conveying water from Lake Assad, some 441 kilometers away with pumping over an altitude of 712 meters. A capacity of 850 million m3 per annum has been envisaged, about twice the current <b>water</b> <b>deficit</b> in Greater Damascus. The cost for bulk water before distribution losses would be more than US$0.50 per cubic meter.|$|E
25|$|In May 2009, King Abdullah {{gave the}} go-ahead {{for a new}} National Water Strategy until 2022, {{replacing}} an earlier Water Strategy from 1998. The strategy included investments of Jordanian Dinar 5.86 billion (US$8.24 billion) {{over a period of}} 15 years, corresponding to more than 160% of Jordan's GDP. It also foresaw a decreasing reliance on groundwater from 32% in 2007 to 17%, increased use of treated wastewater in agriculture from 10% to 13% and increased use of desalination from 1% to 31%. According to then-Minister of Water, Raed Abu Soud, even after the completion of the Disi Water Conveyance Project, the <b>water</b> <b>deficit</b> in 2022 would be about 500 million cubic metres, highlighting the need to include desalination under the Red Sea-Dead Sea canal in the strategy. The strategy also envisaged institutional reforms such as enacting a new water law, separating operational from administrative functions, as well as production from distribution operations, creating a Water Council with advisory functions and establishing a Water Regulatory Commission. While the legal and institutional reforms were not implemented, the Disi Water Conveyance Project was completed in 2013 by the Turkish firm Gama. The influx of about one million refugees from Syria since 2012 increased the population of Jordan to more than nine million. It also increased water demand substantially. For lack of finaning, the Red Sea-Dead Sea Canal is not being pursued any more in its original form for the time being. Instead, a scaled-down, more realistic version is being pursued. This project involves a water swap between Jordan and Israel, with Jordan supplying desalinated water from Aqaba to Southern Israel, while Israel provides additional water from the Sea of Galilee to Northern Jordan. Brine water from the desalination plant is to be supplied to the Dead Sea. As of 2015, the bidding for the desalination plant at Aqaba was under preparation.|$|E

In Poland <b>water</b> <b>deficits</b> in agriculture are occurring more frequently, causing losses in yield, {{not only in the}} Lowland areas but also in the Uplands. This paper presents an assessment of the <b>water</b> <b>deficits</b> at various excedance probability levels for four varieties of field crop and for soil types with various water retention capacity, which occur in the Małopolska Upland. Calculations were performed by balancing the amount of available soil water in the root zone. The study was based on the meteorological data from the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management for the years 1971 – 2010. Daily precipitation data from six rainfall stations: Borusowa, Igołomia, Książ Wielki, Miechów, Olewin and Sielec was utilised as well as average decadal air temperature, water vapour pressure, wind speed and sunshine hours from the meteorological station at Kraków–Balice. The <b>water</b> <b>deficits</b> at an excedance probability level of 20 % fluctuated during the growing season from 5 mm (Phaeozems) to 190 mm (Leptosols). In the Małopolska Upland in soils with a medium capacity to retain water (110 – 160 mm), <b>water</b> <b>deficits</b> have occurred even in years of average rainfall (with probability 50 %).

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the growth response of three European species (Fagus sylvatica, Quercus petraea and Pinus sylvestris) to climatic variations and soil <b>water</b> <b>deficits</b> in the same temperate forest. Three mature stands per species were sampled to obtain earlywood, latewood and total ring chronologies from 1960 to 2007. Climate-growth relationships were established by bootstrapped correlations and response function analysis. Monthly bioclimatic regressors were simulated by a physiological water balance model that used daily climatic data and stand parameters to estimate soil <b>water</b> <b>deficits.</b> Our results highlighted a common sensitivity to precipitation from May to July for the dominant tree growth of the three species but also differences in the species vulnerability to climate and soil <b>water</b> <b>deficits.</b> Beech was the most sensitive species to the climatic conditions of the current growing season. Beech growth was positively correlated with precipitation from May to July and negatively with maximal temperatures in June and July. Oak growth was negatively correlated with minimal temperatures in the previous August and September and positively with precipitation in the previous October and December during pointer years. This led to long-term consequences for growth, probably due to carbon reserve depletion. Pine growth was positively influenced by warm December but was also vulnerable to maximal temperatures and soil <b>water</b> <b>deficits</b> from June to August. The climate in August only influenced the pine growth probably because the growing season of pine was longer than that of the deciduous species. For both oak and pine, latewood was the component that was most sensitive to climatic variations and soil <b>water</b> <b>deficits.</b> According to the study findings, an increase in the frequency {{and the intensity of}} droughts could affect the three species. Maximum summer temperatures could have negative impacts for beech and pine growth. Dry and warm autumns could lead to long-term consequences and decrease the oak growth. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
