40|$|Electrochemical sensor {{devices have}} {{gathered}} great attention in food analysis namely for olive oil evaluation. The adulteration of {{extra-virgin olive oil}} with lower-grade olive oil is a common worldwide fraudulent practice, which detection is a challenging task. The potentiometric fingerprints recorded by lipid polymeric sensor membranes of an electronic tongue, together with linear discriminant analysis and simulated annealing meta-heuristic algorithm, enabled the detection of extra-virgin olive oil adulterated with olive oil for which an intense sensory defect could be perceived, specifically rancid or <b>winey-vinegary</b> negative sensations. The homemade designed taste device allowed the identification of admixing of extra-virgin olive oil with more than 2. 5 % or 5 % of rancid or <b>winey-vinegary</b> olive oil, respectively. Predictive mean sensitivities of 84 ± 4 % or 92 ± 4 % and specificities of 79 ± 6 % or 93 ± 3 % were obtained for rancid or <b>winey-vinegary</b> adulterations, respectively, regarding an internal-validation procedure based on a repeated K-fold cross-validation variant (4 folds× 10 repeats, ensuring that the dataset was forty times randomly split into 4 folds, leaving 25 % of the data for validation purposes). This performance was satisfactory since, according to the legal physicochemical and sensory analysis, the intentionally adulterated olive oil with percentages of 2. 510 %, could still be commercialized as virgin olive oil. It could also be concluded that at a 5 % significance level, the trained panelists could not distinguish extra-virgin olive oil samples from those adulterated with 2. 5 % of rancid olive oil or up to 5 % of <b>winey-vinegary</b> olive oil. Thus, the electronic tongue proposed in this study can be foreseen as a practical and powerful tool to detect this kind of worldwide common fraudulent practice of high quality olive oil.

40|$|Table olives {{are prone}} to the {{appearance}} of sensory defects that decrease their quality {{and in some cases}} result in olives unsuitable for consumption. The evaluation of the type and intensity of the sensory negative attributes of table olives is recommended by the International Olive Council, although not being legally required for commercialization. However, the accomplishment of this task requires the training and implementation of sensory panels according to strict directives, turning out in a time-consuming and expensive procedure that involves a degree of subjectivity. In this work, an electronic tongue is proposed as a taste sensor device for evaluating the intensity of sensory defects of table olives. The potentiometric signal profiles gathered allowed establishing multiple linear regression models, based on the most informative subsets of signals (from 24 to 29 recorded during the analysis of olive aqueous pastes and brine solutions) selected using a simulated annealing meta-heuristic algorithm. The models enabled the prediction of the median intensities (R 2 ≥ 0. 942 and RMSE ≤ 0. 356, for leave-one-out or repeated K-fold cross-validation procedures) of butyric, musty, putrid, <b>winey-vinegary,</b> and zapateria negative sensations being, in general, the predicted intensities within the range of intensities perceived by the sensory panel. Indeed, based on the predicted mean intensities of the sensory defects, the electrochemical-chemometric approach developed could correctly classify 86. 4 % of the table olive samples according to their trade category based on a sensory panel evaluation and following the International Olive Council regulations (i. e., extra, 1 st choice, 2 nd choice, and olives that may not be sold as table olives). So, the satisfactory overall predictions achieved demonstrate that the electronic tongue could be a complementary tool for assessing table olive defects, reducing the effort of trained panelists and minimizing the risk of subjective evaluations.

40|$|The {{capability}} of perceiving olive oils sensory defects and intensities {{plays a key}} role on olive oils quality grade classification since olive oils can only be classified as extra-virgin if no defect can be perceived by a human trained sensory panel. Otherwise, olive oils may be classified as virgin or lampante depending on the median intensity of the defect predominantly perceived and on the physicochemical levels. However, sensory analysis is time-consuming and requires an official sensory panel, which can only evaluate a low number of samples per day. In this work, the potential use of an electronic tongue as a taste sensor device to identify the defect predominantly perceived in olive oils was evaluated. The potentiometric profiles recorded showed that intra- and inter-day signal drifts could be neglected (i. e., relative standard deviations lower than 25 %), being not statistically significant the effect of the analysis day on the overall recorded E-tongue sensor fingerprints (P-value= 0. 5715, for multivariate analysis of variance using Pillai's trace test), which significantly differ according to the olive oils sensory defect (P-value= 0. 0084, for multivariate analysis of variance using Pillai's trace test). Thus, a linear discriminant model based on 19 potentiometric signal sensors, selected by the simulated annealing algorithm, could be established to correctly predict the olive oil main sensory defect (fusty, rancid, wet-wood or <b>winey-vinegary)</b> with average sensitivity of 75 ± 3 % and specificity of 73 ± 4 % (repeated K-fold cross-validation variant: 4 folds× 10 repeats). Similarly, a linear discriminant model, based on 24 selected sensors, correctly classified 92 ± 3 % of the olive oils as virgin or lampante, being an average specificity of 93 ± 3 % achieved. The overall satisfactory predictive performances strengthen the feasibility of the developed taste sensor device as a complementary methodology for olive oils defects analysis and subsequent quality grade classification. Furthermore, the {{capability of}} identifying the type of sensory defect of an olive oil may allow establishing helpful insights regarding bad practices of olives or olive oils production, harvesting, transport and storage.
