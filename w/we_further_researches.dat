30|$|About {{two decades}} ago Lutwak {{introduced}} the concept of p-affine surface area. More recently, the results of Lutwak have been generalized by Ma to the entire class of so-called ith p-affine surface areas.

Affine isoperimetric and Blaschke-Santaló inequalities, which generalize the inequalities obtained by Lutwak, are established.

30|$|It is of {{important}} to note that the average diameter of nanofibers (100 / 0) is about 155 nm (Figure 1 a), whereas being 211 nm in Figure 2 a. This slight contradiction is probably due to the dissolving conditions, including dissolving temperature and time of the nanofibers. The dissolving temperature and time of SS/SF 100 / 0 (Figure 1 a) are 25 °C and 3 h, respectively, while dissolving temperature and time for the nanofibers from SS/SF 100 / 0 (Figure 2 a) are 25 °C and 10 days. <b>We</b> <b>further</b> <b>research</b> the effect of the dissolving conditions on diameter distribution of nanofibers.
