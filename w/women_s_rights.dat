40|$|Betty Friedan {{has been}} celebrated {{as the author}} of the 1963 bestseller, The Feminine Mystique, a book that changed women s lives and was {{inspiration}} for the women s liberation movement. In The Feminine Mystique Betty Friedan gave a name to the frustration white middle-class women living in suburbia with 3. 2 children felt. Women suddenly realized that they were not alone with their problems. Betty Friedan named the frustration that many career homemakers felt the problem that has no name, and urged them to break away from their domestic confines, go back to school, pursue careers, and revive the vision of female independence that had been alive before World War II. The Feminine Mystique lit a spark for the women s liberation movement in the late 1960 s. The movement included the Old Left women in National Organization of Women (NOW), and the young women who created loosely affiliated small groups collectively known as the women s liberation movement. <b>Women</b> <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> entered the political agenda, with giving women the right to abortion in 1973 among the most important victories...|$|E
40|$|The {{best things}} come in threes, and that s {{why we are}} {{bundling}} three books together here. For starters, five case studies from Africa, Asia and Central America, on gender perspectives in natural resources management, are presented in the sixth book in the Gender, Society & Development series of the Royal Tropical Institute (KIT). It is a good read and includes a useful bibliography of both printed and online publications, as well as Web links. One case addresses the changing rights to common pool resources and land in West Africa. If these issues interest you, then {{you might want to}} read a new publication in FAO s Legislative Studies. Issue 76 is dedicated to gender and law in agriculture. A standard factual work, describing rights and laws for women with regard to natural resources, it is for female agricultural workers and self-employed rural women. Regional overviews are offered from all continents; some countries, such as Burkina Faso, Fiji and Kenya, are described in more detail than others. Once you have finished the final chapter on legal reform and the implementation of gender responsive laws, you can start reading Gender and access to land in issue 4 in the FAO Land Tenure Studies. It seeks to raise awareness on gender issues and access to land, and provides guidelines for land administrators to take more account of the specifics of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> and roles.

40|$|Violence {{against women}} (VAW) is only {{beginning}} {{to be recognized as}} a major societal problem within and across Asia. This is evidenced by the high level of self-reporting by men and women of sexual violence and domestic violence in recent UN surveys; the extremely low conviction rates for these forms of violence; the slow, partial or non-adoption of anti-VAW laws; and the lack of a regional anti-VAW Convention in Asia. This UNRISD working paper explores how the global context of norm diffusion, state ranking, conflict and advocacy networking affects societal and policy change in the region to strengthen <b>women</b> 4 <b>s</b> <b>rights.</b> It highlights the increased visibility and reporting of VAW as a result of international norm diffusion particularly via the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) and the pressure exerted by intergovernmental organizations on governments to address VAW. It argues that non-state actors, especially global media and regional advocacy networks, have energized the push to end the culture of impunity for VAW. In combination, these transnational forces are radically altering the policy environment in Asia, making it non-negotiable for governments to respond to VAW and halt the slow progress to date in achieving <b>women</b> 4 <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> to bodily integrity...|$|R
40|$|<b>Women</b> <b>s</b> {{entrepreneurial}} skills and activities greatly enhance {{the development of}} rural Africa. To bring together some major thinking in this area, the Ministry of Agriculture of Greece, Austrian Development Cooperation (ADC) and CTA co-organised a seminar entitled The economic {{role of women in}} rural and agricultural development - the promotion of income-generating activities, which was held in October 1999 in Athens, Greece. The seminar was attended by around fifty women from sixteen African countries. The largest CTA event yet held in this field, it addressed root obstacles and prerequisites for <b>women</b> <b>s</b> income-generating activities. Despite their predominant role in agriculture women rarely have legal or customary rights to have access to, or to control, factors of production, like credit, land, water and training. They usually miss out on the profits from production too. The issue of limited access to land - an important drawback for women across rural Africa - drew much comment at the seminar. Under successive series of customary, colonial and post-colonial legislation in most countries, <b>women</b> <b>s</b> land <b>rights</b> have not been defined and they remain denied today. The seminar suggested that land laws should be set right, and harmonised with civil and criminal laws and accompanied by people s awareness-raising programmes. Various presentations at the seminar were clear proof of women organising themselves to access resources, such as commercial credits. In village banking programmes in rural South Africa, 80 % of members are female. Their motto Invest first where your best interests are, instead of invest where the best interest is works well for them! Women, after all, should be the subjects rather than the objects of development. That was the main message of the seminar, and the availability of its full proceedings will be announced in a future issue of Spore. seminar entitled The economic role of women in rural and agricultural development - the promotion of income-generating activities, which was held in October 1999 in Athens, Greec...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the theme of}} Afro-American Women facing hidden racism has been {{compiled}} into useful information. The theme is still of worldwide concern after centuries of slavery and discrimination against Afro-Americans. The investigation has been divided into three main chapters. The first chapter deals with Afro-American women under pro-slavery rules. It describes the physical, sexual, and moral exploitation of black women during the era of slavery in the United States. The second chapter relates the first struggles against oppression. Here we talk about Anti-slavery Movements; Racism in the Women s Suffrage Movement; the Sense of Emancipation according to Black women; Education and Liberation; the Black Women s point of view; the Birth of Black <b>Women</b> <b>s</b> <b>Rights,</b> and Violence and Segregation coming from feminine Ku Klux Klan Groups. The third and last chapter refers to twentieth century Afro-American women and their progress during the last 100 years. Here we find information about Birth Control and Reproductive Rights; Myths; Language and Identity; the Challenge of Being Hired; the Color of Beauty; and interesting biographies of four important black women at the present time.

40|$|Why have Western donors {{efforts to}} {{encourage}} development of Russian nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) varied dramatically {{in two different}} NGO sectors, despite similar levels of assistance? I forward a norms-based explanation for varying success in bolstering the Russian women s and soldiers rights movements. Where foreign assistance is employed to promote norms that are universally embraced, it is highly {{likely to lead to}} a successful NGO movement. In contrast, when foreign assistance pursues norms that are specific to other societal contexts, it will fail to develop an NGO movement, regardless of the amount of funding foreign donors devote. NGOs and foreign donors have succeeded by articulating a universal norm against physical harm in the cases of soldiers rights and domestic violence, but have failed by voicing specifically Western norms of gender equality and feminism in the case of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> <b>rights.</b> I wish to thank Kathleen Collins, Elisabeth Friedman, Kathryn Hochstetler, David Holloway, Stephen Krasner, Gail Lapidus, Michael McFaul, and especially Richard Price, Lisa Martin, and two anonymous reviewers for their close readings and comments on versions of this article.

40|$|A Human Rights-Based Approach (HRBA) to {{development}} has been adopted by numerous international NGOs, multilateral and bilateral agencies. In theory, the HRBA {{has the potential to}} dislodge inequalities and discrimination that perpetuate poverty. However, the implementation of the HRBA at the local level has been a challenge. This thesis is an examination of how the HRBA is operationalized at the local level by international NGOs and its actual impact on women s empowerment. In order to achieve this, a case of ActionAid s intervention on <b>women</b> <b>s</b> <b>rights</b> in Malawi s Rumphi district, was studied. Contrary to what an HRBA assumes, the study indicates a top-down approach during the implementation of the project. This shows that the HRBA as applied by AAM did not lead to a radical transformation of power relations among development actors namely: the donor, AAM staff, the RWF and the right-holders. This in turn limited the desired empowerment outcomes among the right-holders. The study established that there are many challenges that affect the implementation of the HRBA. These include low education levels among the right-holders, high poverty levels and lack of financial resources to implement a holistic approach. The study further indicates that the HRBA aided in filling the knowledge gap among women on various developmental issues. However, the study confirmed that such intangible benefits do not address the immediate needs of the right-holders. The study suggests that for effective poverty reduction, development actors must consider blending the HRBA with other approaches in order to address the immediate needs of the right-holders...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{legal and}} {{institutional}} reforms in Morocco, particularly the amended constitution of 2011, which guarantees gender equality and women s political participation, {{along with the}} reform of the Family Code in 2004, have significantly impacted democracy and the modernization process in Moroccan society. Unlike Libya and Egypt, Morocco did not experience a revolution. Yet, it did not escape the tumult of the so-called Arab spring. Thousands of protesters {{took to the streets}} in a dozen of cities led by the February 20 Movement, which demanded the end of corruption and the right to social justice and gender equity. Women were strongly represented in these protests for democracy; they came from different ethnic and political backgrounds and marched alongside the men, demanding social and political change. The post Arab Spring government has committed to implement the new constitution through women s increased political participation. As a result, more women joined parliament through the quota system for women and youth. The 2011 constitution reserved ten per cent of seats for women and ten percent for youth, in the hope of encouraging their political participation and their representation in parliament and government. Despite the positive changes in Morocco and the growing emancipation of women in all domains, there are still hurdles that hinder their emancipation and participation in public life, such as illiteracy, unemployment, poverty, lack of education and professional training, insufficient resources, difficult access to loans, and weak representation in decision and policy-making.

40|$|Background: Vietnam has {{undergone}} a rapid transition in the past 20 years, moving towards a more equal situation for men and women. However, Confucian doctrine is still strong and {{little is known about}} men <b>s</b> violence against <b>women</b> within the Vietnamese family. Aim: To improve knowledge of intimate partner violence (IPV) in a Vietnamese context, by focusing on professionals and trusted community inhabitants explanations of the violence and their suggestions for preventive activities. Further, to present data on prevalence, risk factors and health effects and to suggest appropriate intervention and prevention activities. Method: Qualitative and quantitative data were collected in the rural district, Ba Vi in northern Vietnam in 2002. Five focus group discussions were held and face-to-face interviews following a questionnaire developed by WHO for violence research were performed. In the epidemiological part, 883 married/partnered women aged 17 60 were included. Bi- and multivariate analyses were undertaken, with effect modification analyses and calculation of attributable fractions and population attributable fractions. Main findings: In the explorative qualitative study, intimate partner violence was explained as interplay between individual and family-related factors and socio-cultural norms and practices where Confucian ideology exerted a strong influence (paper I). It further revealed that IPV was rarely discussed openly in the community and women subjected to violence kept silent. The epidemiological study revealed that out of the 883 married/partnered women, 30. 9 % had been subjected to physical violence in their lifetime, and 8. 3 % in the preceding year. For the combined exposure to physical and sexual violence, the corresponding figures were 32. 7 % and 9. 2 %. The most commonly occurring form was psychological abuse (lifetime 55. 4 %; past year 33. 7 %). Lifetime experience of sexual violence was reported by 6. 6 % of the women, and by 2. 2 % for previous year exposure. In the majority of cases, the violence was exerted as repeated acts (paper II). The risk factors found for lifetime and past year physical/sexual violence were <b>women</b> <b>s</b> low education, husbands low education, low household income and male polygamy. The pattern of factors associated with psychological abuse alone were husband s low professional status and <b>women</b> <b>s</b> intermediate level of education (paper II). Women who witnessed interparental violence during childhood {{were significantly more likely to}} report experience of physical and sexual intimate partner violence in their own relationship at adult age and they also displayed a more tolerant attitude towards violence (paper III). When health effects were investigated, itwas found that physical and sexual violence caused chronic pain, injuries and serious mental health problems such as sadness/depression and suicidal thoughts in exposed women (Paper IV). Conclusions: IPV is commonly occurring in rural Vietnam, more so among the low educated and in poorer households. Violence perpetration is a serious violation of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> human <b>rights</b> that causes long-term suffering in exposed women. These findings call for legal and policy actions.

40|$|Like {{many other}} African countries, {{the system of}} {{traditional}} leadership and chieftainship in Lesotho is strongly embraced and deeply embedded. Under customary law chiefs have been regarded as and served as governors of their societies with power over different aspects of life. However the traditional leadership systems have been {{and continue to be}} predominantly male. The study therefore will examine the institution of chieftainship in Lesotho under both the Constitution and customary and; how this has led to gender inequality and infringement of international human rights law. Under customary law which is recognized by common law women, daughters in particular are denied the right to succeed to chieftainship on the basis of gender and sex. As a result, this has led to gender inequality and discrimination against women. Although the kingdom of Lesotho practices a dual system, obligating itself to incorporate international law into domestic law, it has been evident that both the constitution and customary law are inconsistent with international law particularly Article 2 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women, which aims to protect and promote human rights; In this case <b>women</b> <b>s</b> <b>rights.</b> Although chieftainship perceived to be important and relevant, {{it has been argued that}} the institution of traditional leadership no longer has a place in the modern world therefore should be abolished. The study further examines some similar cases and judicial responses as well as the application of international law in addressing the issue of gender inequality that results from customary law. I also question under what or which circumstances shall customary law take precedence over international law and when should international law precede over customary/ domestic law. I therefore argue and recommend for the reformation and amendment of Chieftainship Act as well as the Constitution of Lesotho which continues to advocate for gender inequality based on cultural practices and customary law and lastly, the adoption of positive practices from the other African states the paper look at.
