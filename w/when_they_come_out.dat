5|$|Miles, Richard, and Ben {{go back to}} {{the barracks}} to get some C4 that Ben {{secretly}} kept in his closet behind the bookcase. When they get there Miles hears the screams of Ben's daughter Alex, buried there. They get the C4 but <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> they are confronted by Widmore and his geologist Zoe. Widmore says he needs a hiding place because the monster was coming. Ben reluctantly says he can hide in his secret room. When The Man in Black comes Richard says he can talk to it, claiming all he wants is for Richard to join him. Ben goes with him but Miles; saying he is sticking to surviving, decides to leave them and run back into the jungle.|$|E
5|$|Great spotted kiwis are monogamous, with pairings {{sometimes}} lasting twenty years. Nests {{are made}} in burrows. The breeding season begins in June and ends in March, as this is when food is plentiful. Males reach sexual maturity at 18months in captivity, while females are able to lay eggs after three years. In the wild, sexual maturity for both sexes is between ages three and five. Great spotted kiwi males chase females around until the females either run off or mate. The pair mates about {{two to three times}} during peak activity. The gestation period is about a month. Females do not eat during this period, as the eggs will take up a fourth of a kiwi's body mass. The yolk takes up 65% of the egg. In most bird eggs, the yolk takes up about 35 to 40% of the egg. This makes the kiwi egg the largest in proportion to the body. Females must rely on fat stored from the previous five months to survive. Because of the large size of the egg, gestation is uncomfortable for the female, and they do not move much. To relieve the pain, females soak themselves in water <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> of the burrows by dipping their abdomens into puddles. The egg-laying season is between August and January.|$|E
25|$|Openly {{transsexual}} {{people can}} have difficulty maintaining employment. Most {{find it necessary to}} remain employed during transition in order to cover the costs of living and transition. However, employment discrimination against trans people is rampant {{and many of them are}} fired <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> or are involuntarily outed at work. Transsexual people must decide whether to transition on-the-job, or to find a new job when they make their social transition. Other stresses that transsexual people face in the workplace are being fearful of coworkers negatively responding to their transition, and losing job experience under a previous name—even deciding which rest room to use can prove challenging. Finding employment can be especially challenging for those in mid-transition.|$|E

25|$|Outdoors, {{house centipedes}} prefer {{to live in}} cool, damp places. Centipede {{respiratory}} systems do not provide any mechanism for shutting the spiracles, {{and that is why}} they need an environment that protects them from dehydration and excessive cold. Most live outside, primarily under large rocks, piles of wood, and especially in compost piles. Within the home, these centipedes are found in almost any part of the house. Most commonly they are encountered in basements, bathrooms, and lavatories, which tend to be humid, but they can also be found in drier places like offices, bedrooms and dining rooms. The greatest likelihood of encountering them is in spring, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> because the weather gets warmer, and in autumn/fall, when the cooling weather forces them to find shelter in human habitats.|$|E
500|$|Some {{denizens of}} Chulip only {{come out of}} their underground, living apartments through holes in the ground at certain times of the day. If the player looks through these holes, clues are given in regard to <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> or when to kiss them. After an NPC comes out of the ground, the player has a very limited {{opportunity}} to give them a kiss. If the player successfully kisses enough NPCs and returns home to sleep, the hero's father will recite his progress and the Lover's Tree will give the player more hearts and an improved reputation if he advances. Secondary to improving his reputation, the player must track down all the pieces to the [...] "Love Letter Set" [...] by traveling throughout Long Life Town. As the story progresses, the player gains access to new areas of the game world via train, which include many more underground residents and hazards. Saving takes place in various bathrooms.|$|E

2500|$|It's not ill-conceived to look {{at certain}} people and {{question}} <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> <b>out</b> here what they bring with them ... We have strict quarantine laws {{and it should be}} the same when it comes to cultures that do not want to integrate. We should be very careful about where certain Muslims come from and what they believe. If you come here, you should behave yourself – it's as simple as that... If people come and live in any country and their way of life is so different they need their own special laws, then possibly they have to pick somewhere else to live. The idea of any Muslim being photographed for a passport or a licence with one of those shrouds on – sorry, it just can't happen.|$|E
