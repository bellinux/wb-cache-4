500|$|The film project {{started in}} late 2004 when John Nordling, a {{producer}} at the production company EFTI, contacted Ajvide Lindqvist's publisher Ordfront {{to acquire the}} rights for a film adaptation of his novel, Let the Right One In: [...] "At Ordfront they just laughed when I called, I was like the 48th they put on the list. But I called John Ajvide Lindqvist {{and it turned out}} we had the same idea of what kind of film we should make. It wasn't about money, but about the right constellation". A friend introduced Tomas Alfredson to the novel. While he normally does not like to receive books, because [...] "it's a private thing to choose what to read", he decided after a few weeks to read it. The depiction of bullying in the novel affected Alfredson deeply. [...] "It's very hard and very down-to-earth, unsentimental (...) I had some period <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> when I had hard times in school (...) So it really shook me", he told the Los Angeles Times. Ajvide Lindqvist already knew Alfredson's previous work, and he and Alfredson discovered that they [...] "understood each other very well".|$|E

2500|$|In her childhood, Jemison {{learned to}} make {{connections}} to science by studying nature. Once when a splinter infected her thumb as a little girl, Jemison's mother {{turned it into a}} learning experience. She ended up doing a whole project about pus. Jemison's parents were very supportive of her interest in science, while her teachers were not. [...] "In kindergarten, my teacher asked me what I wanted to be <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up,</b> and I told her a scientist," [...] Jemison says. [...] "She said, 'Don't you mean a nurse?' Now, there's nothing wrong with being a nurse, but that's not what I wanted to be." [...] In an interview with Makers, she further explains how her sheer interest in science was not accepted. [...] "Growing up...I was just like every other kid. I loved space, stars and dinosaurs. I always knew I wanted to explore. At the time of the Apollo airing, everybody was thrilled about space, but I remember being irritated that there were no women astronauts. People tried to explain that to me, and I did not buy it." ...|$|E

In the first place, I {{must tell you that}} I was born in Omaha, and my father, who was a politician, named me Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkle Emmannuel Ambroise Diggs, Diggs being the last name because he could think of no more to go before it. Taken altogether, it was a dreadfully long name to weigh down a poor innocent child, and one of the hardest lessons I ever learned was to remember my own name. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> I just called myself O.

I don't mind VERY much because {{he is such a}} little boy and I am quite a big one, but still it is not {{pleasant}} to have faces made at you. And Davy makes such terrible ones.

It was such a long way off and lots of things might happen. The Creature might run away with some other girl--or I might have the smallpox--or Beatrix's nose might be {{straight}} when she grew up. And if Beatrix's nose were straight she'd be a great deal prettier than I am. But nothing did happen--and her nose is puggier than ever. Then <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> things were horrid. I never could have a single little bit of fun. And Beatrix had such a good time! She had scores of lovers in spite of her nose. To be sure, she's engaged now--and he's a horrid, faddy little creature. But he is her own choice. She wasn't told that there was a man in England whom she must marry by and by, when he got sufficiently reconciled to the idea to come and ask her. Oh, it makes me furious!" ...|$|E

People that I came to know later on, like Bob, seem to be slipping away from me. There was a baritone in my father's company, a tremendous man, with shining black eyes, and a voice like a great bell--quite pretty at the top, though: {{he must have been}} sixty at least; and he was very fat; but he was the most dignified man I ever saw. You should have heard him do the Duke in Lucrezia Borgia, or sing Pro Peccatis from Rossini's Stabat Mater! I was ten years old when he was with us, and my grand ambition was to sing with him <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up.</b> He would shake his head if he saw Susanetta now. I would rather hear him sing three bars than have ten visits from Bob. Oh, dear! I thought this cursed pain was getting numbed, but it is worse than ever." ...|$|E

It seems such a cowardly thing to run away and leave all the burden upon your shoulders, yours and Janet's, though I know it will be principally on yours; but {{what else is there}} to do? It was not for my own sake that I wanted before to go, but I did not see what there was for me to do here even <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up.</b> Still, as mother said it would break her heart if I went away, of course there was an end of it for the time, though I have always thought it would be {{something}} to fall back upon if, when I got to eighteen or nineteen, nothing else turned up, which seemed to me very likely would be the case.

But one day while out hunting, King Phearse--that was my father's name--had a quarrel with Krewl and tapped him gently on the nose with the {{knuckles}} of his closed hand. This so provoked the wicked Krewl that he tripped my father backward, so that he fell into a deep pond. At once Krewl threw in a mass of heavy stones, which so weighted down my poor father that his body could not rise again to the surface. It is impossible to kill anyone in this land, as perhaps you know, but when my father was pressed down into the mud {{at the bottom of the}} deep pool and the stones held him so he could never escape, he was of no more use to himself or the world than if he had died. Knowing this, Krewl proclaimed himself King, taking possession of the royal castle and driving all my father's people out. I was a small boy, then, but <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up</b> I became a gardener. I have served King Krewl without his knowing that I am the son of the same King Phearse whom he so cruelly made away with." ...|$|E
60|$|Patriarchs {{were fairly}} {{common in the}} land of my nativity: grave, dignified old men with {{imposing}} beards, owners of land and cattle and many horses, though many of them could not spell their own names; handsome too, some of them with regular features, descendants of good old Spanish families who colonized the wide pampas in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. I do not think I have got one of this sort in the preceding chapters which treat of our neighbours, unless it be Don Anastacio Buenavida of the corkscrew curls and quaint taste in pigs. Certainly he was of the old landowning class, and in his refined features and delicate little hands and feet gave evidence of good blood, but the marks of degeneration were equally plain; he was an effeminate, futile person, and not properly to be ranked with the patriarchs. His ugly grotesque neighbour of the piebald horses was more like one. I described the people that lived nearest to us, our next-door neighbours so to speak, because I knew them from childhood and followed their fortunes <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>grew</b> <b>up,</b> and was thus able to give their complete history. The patriarchs, the grand old gaucho estancieros, I came to know, were scattered all over the land, but, with one exception, I did not know them intimately from childhood, and though I could fill this chapter with their portraits I prefer to give it all to the one I knew best, Don Evaristo Penalva, a very fine patriarch indeed.|$|E
