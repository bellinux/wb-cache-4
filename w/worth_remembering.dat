It is <b>worth</b> <b>remembering</b> however that although Northumberland, like many administrative areas in England, has been shorn of its geographical regional centre, that centre – Newcastle upon Tyne – remains an essential element within the entity we know as Northumberland.

"Although Jackson {{dismissed}} {{far fewer}} government employees {{than most of}} his contemporaries imagined and {{although he did not}} originate the spoils system, he made more sweeping changes in the Federal bureaucracy than had any of his predecessors.

2500|$|Latin evolved {{during the}} Middle Ages {{into a new}} language, the [...] "volgare". The latter emerged as the {{confluence}} of various regional dialects, among which the Tuscan dialect predominated, but the population of Rome also developed its own dialect, the Romanesco. The Romanesco spoken during the Middle Ages {{was more like a}} southern Italian dialect, very close to the Neapolitan language in Campania. The influence of the Florentine culture during the renaissance, and above all, the immigration to Rome of many Florentines following the two Medici Popes (Leo X and Clement VII), caused a major shift in the dialect, which began to resemble more the Tuscan varieties. This remained largely confined to Rome until the 19th century, but then expanded to other zones of Lazio (Civitavecchia, Latina and others), {{from the beginning of the}} 20th century, thanks to the rising population of Rome and to improving transportation systems. As a consequence of education and media like radio and television, Romanesco became more similar to standard Italian. Dialectal literature in the traditional form of Romanesco includes the works of such authors as Giuseppe Gioachino Belli (one of the most important Italian poets altogether), Trilussa and Cesare Pascarella. It is <b>worth</b> <b>remembering</b> though that Romanesco was a [...] "lingua vernacola" [...] (vernacular language), meaning that for centuries, it did not have a written form but it was only spoken by the population.|$|E

40|$|Some authors {{reported}} that Alkali-activated Cement Based Binder (AACB) mortars can have much higher drying shrinkage than Portland cement based composites. Its <b>worth</b> <b>remember</b> that shrinkage performance {{is a very}} important property for reinforced concrete composites just because a high shrinkage performance is associated to cracking tendency that leads to future durability problems. Usually shrinkage is assessed under unrestrained conditions. However, the use of a restrained ellipse ring test is especially interesting for materials that will be used in restrained conditions like repair mortars. This paper provides results on restrained and unrestrained shrinkage performance of fly ash AACB mortars. The restrained shrinkage was assessed with an elliptical ring that provides a faster and more reliable assessment of the cracking potential than circular rings. The results show that the mixtures with lower sodium silicate content are associated to a lower unrestrained shrinkage. Mixtures with lower sodium silicate content showed reduced average crack width under restrained conditions. The results also show that the reduction of sodium silicate content delays the appearance of cracks and is also associated to lower crack width. The use of AACB mortars in restrained conditions requires the use of a reduced sodium silicate content or else the use of fibres to prevent crack appearance.
