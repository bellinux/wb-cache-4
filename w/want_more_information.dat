50|$|Board-level {{circuit designs}} {{can often be}} breadboarded for testing. Even with a breadboard, some circuit {{properties}} may not be accurate compared to the final printed wiring board, such as parasitic resistances and capacitances. These parasitic components can often be estimated more accurately using SPICE simulation. Also, designers may <b>want</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> about the circuit than is available from a single mock-up. For instance, circuit performance is affected by component manufacturing tolerances. In these cases {{it is common to}} use SPICE to perform Monte Carlo simulations of the effect of component variations on performance, a task which is impractical using calculations by hand for a circuit of any appreciable complexity.|$|E

5000|$|X-Day is a {{traditional}} part of the Church of the SubGenius, a religion formed as a parody of cults and extreme religious groups, and their pamphlets and claims. X-Day fell on July 5, 1998, the scheduled [...] "end of the world", and has been celebrated on July 5 each year since then. From its inception in 1980, the Church had prophesied that an army of alien invaders (known as the [...] "X-ists" [...] or [...] "Men From Planet X") would land on the planet Earth and destroy the world of [...] "normals", [...] "pinks", and [...] "glorps," [...] while {{the members of the}} Church of the SubGenius would be rescued by the aliens and taken away into space. Chapters 10 and 11 of Revelation X: The [...] "Bob" [...] Apocryphon supplies additional details as to the precise kinds of fates which supposedly await the [...] "pinks" [...] and [...] "normals" [...] (as well as SubGenii who have not paid their membership fees) left behind when X-Day comes, saying, among other things, that those who are not immediately killed by the aliens will be enslaved by a society of evil clowns known as the [...] "Bozo Cult" [...] until eventually their souls are devoured by the Elder Gods.

40|$|Raising {{an infant}} {{can be a}} tumultuous time for parents, with an {{increased}} risk of depression and anxiety, strain on marital and social relations, role conflict, increased stress and fatigue, difficulties working and poorer overall psychological well-being. These difficulties during the infant years can affect parent and child mental health, child competence, marital support, the parent-child relationship and even child cognitive, social and motor development. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess what predicts parents’ need for help when raising infants, and to identify specific areas in which parents <b>want</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> and support. Measures included developmental history, postnatal depression, parental self-efficacy, happiness, couple relationship, social network, perceptions of baby behaviours, and satisfaction with sources of parenting information and support within a sample of 159 parents of infants. It was hypothesised that (1) the majority of parents will <b>want</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> and support than they are currently receiving; (2) the majority of parents will want information on parent programs; (3) those who are high in postnatal depression, low on happiness, low on parental self-efficacy, are unhappy in their current relationship or social network, or who report baby behaviours as intense problems will be more likely to <b>want</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> and support regarding parenting; and (4) those who are high in postnatal depression, low on happiness, low on parental self-efficacy, are unhappy in their current relationship or social network, or who report baby behaviours as intense problems will be more likely to want information about parenting programs. Results revealed that the majority of parents <b>want</b> <b>more</b> <b>information</b> and support, over a third of parents want information on parenting programs, and Self-Efficacy is an important predictor of parents’ need for help while raising infants. Furthermore, satisfaction with informal support is a predictor of wanting more information and support regarding parenting.

40|$|Objective: Pulmonary {{arterial}} hypertension (PAH) and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) decrease life expectancy for affected patients. The {{aim was to}} describe the perceptions of received information regarding diagnosis, treatment and management, {{as well as social}} support and coping perceived by patients with PAH or CTEPH. Methods: A descriptive, national cohort survey that included patients from all PAH-centres in Sweden. A quantitative methodology was employed where all patients received three questionnaires, QLQ-INFO 25, Mastery Scale and Social Network & Support Scale. Results: The response rate was 74 % (n. = 325), mean age 66. ±. 14. years, 71 % were female and 69 % were diagnosed with PAH and 31 % with CTEPH. Sixty percent of respondents were satisfied with the received information and felt it was helpful. Best experiences were of information in the areas of medical tests (70 %) and the disease (61 %). Forty-five percent <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> <b>information.</b> Men described their social network as more accessible than women (p. = 0. 004). Those living alone had a lower coping ability. Conclusion: Despite a high level of satisfaction with the received information, almost half of the patients <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> <b>information.</b> Practice implications: Regular repeating or giving new information should be an ongoing process in the care of patients at the PAH-centres...|$|R
