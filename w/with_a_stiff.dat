5|$|The {{paramount}} chief maintained some loyalty for his subjects. He {{persuaded the}} Germans {{to carry out}} infrastructure improvements such as the building of roads, schools, health clinics, and churches; and he defended his subjects from colonial reprisals. In one instance, an Ewondo interpreter fired a gun during a dispute with a German, an offence punishable <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>stiff</b> prison sentence. Atangana interceded, and the man's punishment was reduced to porter duty. However, the paramount chief remained completely loyal to the governors. In 1914, for example, representatives of Duala leader Rudolf Duala Manga Bell tried to secure Atangana's backing for a pan-Kamerun revolt. Atangana kept the plot under wraps, but he instructed the envoy to urge Manga Bell to reconsider.|$|E

25|$|As {{a pitcher}} in baseball's amateur era, Creighton changed the sport with his {{pitching}} style, from {{a game that}} showcased fielding into a confrontation between the pitcher and batter. During his era, a pitcher was required to deliver the ball in an underhand motion <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>stiff</b> arm/stiff wrist movement. The speed with which Creighton was able to pitch the ball had previously been thought of as impossible without movement of his elbow or wrist. If there were any movements in his elbow or wrist, they were imperceptible, but he was accused by some opponents and spectators of using an illegal delivery. However, the competitive advantage of this delivery, and his success as a pitcher, eventually led others to emulate his technique.|$|E

The attacks were met <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>stiff</b> PAVN resistance and were stopped at the Thạch Hãn River. A further attack from the coast by the Vietnamese Marines in November made limited gains. By the end of 1972 the Marines and ARVN occupied positions 5km south of the river.

25|$|She is an {{extremely}} private person who keeps her thoughts and feelings to herself and hates when someone tries to understand her, which {{is thought to be}} why Edward is unable to hear her thoughts. She is also known to be incredibly stubborn with her self, because of her determination to become a vampire in order to be with Edward forever. She is also said to possess poor acting skills.

25|$|The Badgers {{took the}} opening drive {{of the second}} half and moved into the Gamecocks red zone but would be forced to settle for a 35–yard field goal by K Jack Russell. South Carolina got the ball for their first second half drive. On their first play, Connor Shaw {{scrambled}} for 8 yards but fumbled after he was hit by Badgers LB Derek Landisch. The ball was recovered by fellow Badgers LB Ethan Armstrong. Wisconsin started at the South Carolina 31–yard line but failed to move the ball into the red zone and were forced to try a field goal. The kick from Jack Russell was wide right from 42 yards. South Carolina then drove 75 yards scoring on a 22–yard touchdown pass to Bruce Ellington from Connor Shaw. On the first play of the Badgers next drive, QB Joel Stave would scamble for 5 yards but was hit hard by a South Carolina defender. A few plays later after handing the ball off, Stave would be forced to leave the game with a shoulder injury. Taking over at quarterback for the Badgers was sixth year senior Curt Phillips. The third quarter would come to a close with the Badgers moving into Gamecock territory. On fourth and one from the South Carolina 26–yard line, Wisconsin decided to go for the first down instead to try a 40 plus yard field goal. The Gamecocks defense stuffed the Badgers and they turned the ball over on down. Six plays later, South Carolina extended their lead with a 3–yard touchdown pass to Jerell Adams from Connor Shaw. However, the Badgers would strike quickly on the ensuring kickoff. Badgers kick returner, Kenzel Doe, returned the kickoff 91 yards for a touchdown. The return was highlighted <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>stiff</b> arm that sprung Doe for the score. The Badgers were within three with just under 11 minutes left in the game. Once again, South Carolina would answer this time a 9 play 88 yard drive capped by a 1–yard touchdown run by Connor Shaw on a QB sneak. The Badgers then took over and got to the Gamecocks 47–yard line before Curt Phillips was intercepted. With less than five minutes left, the Gamecocks took over. Wisconsin LB Conor O'Neill then forced a fumble that was recovered by CB Darius Hillary. The Badgers then moved the ball to the Gamecocks 16–yard line but again backup QB Curt Phillips was intercepted. The Badgers defense would force the Gamecocks to punt and the Badgers took over with 2:10 left in the game still down by 10 points. Wisconsin got down to South Carolina's 17–yard line but the Badgers tried a trick play with a screen to WR Jared Abbrederis who then attempted to pitch the ball to RB Melvin Gordon but he mishandled the ball and fumbled turning the ball over to South Carolina. Two kneel downs later and the game was over with a South Carolina victory over Wisconsin, 34–24.|$|E

40|$|Soft {{materials}} <b>with</b> <b>an</b> embedded <b>stiffer</b> layer {{are increasingly}} used in medical and sports engineering. A detailed {{understanding of the}} mechanical behaviour of such a material system under localised load and resistance to indentation is very important. In this work, the deformation of an isotropic soft matrix <b>with</b> <b>a</b> buried <b>stiffer</b> thin layer under a circular flat indenter was investigated through finite element (FE) modelling. A practical approach in simulating the indentation resistance of such a system (soft matrix <b>with</b> <b>a</b> buried thin <b>stiffer</b> layer) is evaluated. The numerical result is correlated with the data based on analytical approaches for both homogenous materials and elastic half space <b>with</b> <b>an</b> embedded <b>stiffer</b> layer. The influence of Poisson’s ratio and auxeticity of the matrix on the deformation and indentation stiffness of the material system under different conditions (indenter size, sheet thickness and embedment depth) were established and main influences of the Poisson’s ratio on the material deformation and stresses are discussed. The result shows that the influence of matrix auxeticity on indentation resistance is highly depth dependent, with over 30 % enhancement of the indentation resistance being predicted for materials <b>with</b> matrix of <b>a</b> negative Poisson’s ratio...|$|R

500|$|The [...] "hunch" [...] threat {{display of}} the grey reef shark is the most {{pronounced}} and well-known agonistic display (a display directed towards competitors or threats) of any shark. Investigations of this behavior have {{been focused on the}} reaction of sharks to approaching divers, some of which have culminated in attacks. The display consists of the shark raising its snout, dropping its pectoral fins, arching its back, and curving its body laterally. While holding this posture, the shark swims <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>stiff,</b> exaggerated side-to-side motion, sometimes combined with rolls or figure-8 loops. The intensity of the display increases if the shark is more closely approached or if obstacles are blocking its escape routes, such as landmarks or other sharks. If the diver persists, the shark will either retreat or launch a rapid open-mouthed attack, slashing with its upper teeth.|$|E
500|$|Younger {{silky sharks}} {{are known to}} form large, loosely {{organized}} aggregations, possibly for mutual defense. During migrations, over a thousand individuals may gather. These groups are generally segregated by size, and in the Pacific perhaps also by sex. Silky sharks within a group have been observed to [...] "tilt", presenting their full lateral profile towards each other, as well as gape their jaws or puff out their gills. On occasion, sharks have also been seen suddenly charging straight up, veering away just before reaching the surface and gliding back down to deeper water. The significance of these behaviors is unknown. When confronted, the silky shark may perform a threat display, in which it arches its back, drops its tail and pectoral fins, and elevates its head. The shark then proceeds to swim in tight loops <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>stiff,</b> jerky motion, often turning broadside towards the perceived threat.|$|E
