50|$|McQuay-Norris was a {{maker of}} {{automobile}} engine parts such as piston rings, and chassis parts like steering <b>wheel</b> <b>knuckle</b> bolts. It also produced and distributed electrical controls for gas appliances. Based in St. Louis, Missouri, the company merged with Eaton Yale & Towne Inc., Cleveland, Ohio, in August 1969. Prior to the merger, the McCord Corporation, of Detroit, Michigan, acquired 10.5% of McQuay-Norris common stock, in June 1969.According to interviews {{with at least one}} St. Louis resident, McQuay-Norris manufactured bullets in the 1940s.|$|E

50|$|CitroÃ«n {{invested}} enormous {{resources to}} design and launch an entirely new vehicle in 1970, the SM, which was in effect a thoroughly modernized DS, with similar length, but greater width. The manual gearbox was a modified DS unit. The front disc brakes were the same design. Axles, <b>wheel</b> bearings, steering <b>knuckles,</b> and hydraulic components were either DS parts or modified DS parts.|$|R
5000|$|Sterling Elliott (1852-1922) {{produced}} {{a series of}} successful inventions in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He held more than 125 patents, receiving his first at age 22. He was foremost an Inventor but also a successful businessman. His tenacity and determination to improve on everyday objects helped {{enhance the quality of}} life for established businesses, as well as the average person. His inventive mind and creative genius developed the first Knot Tying machine (No.237,966 [...] ), the low wheeled trotting sulky (No.494,113), the Elliott addressing machine (No.707,961), the pneumatic tire (No.487,874), the ball bearing (No. 483,836) and last but not least the unequal turning of the front <b>wheels</b> or steering <b>knuckle</b> (i.e.- kingpin) that would turn out to be a critical element in the success of the automobile.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{field of}} {{automated}} defect recognition {{has seen a}} tremendous growth {{in the last few}} decades. On one hand we have an operator with an advanced computing system (brain) but prone to fatigue, stress and succumbing to the environment. On the other hand, we have a tireless and extremely fast computer system. The casting industry uses x-ray inspection to verify the structural integrity of the parts. <b>Wheels,</b> Pistons, Steering <b>Knuckles</b> are a few examples of the parts inspected. Their reliability is very crucial towards the Quality of an automobile and hence the industry has strict standards towards quality that an ADR system must conform to. In addition, the bulk of production demands an extremely robust and efficient system that can be operated real-time. In the past few years this system has gone from a human intensive system to a totally automated computer aided system. Such a defect recognition system involves set-up time. This is the time required to tune the system to identify the defects in a particular part. The number of parameters to adjust, the data (images) required for the same and the ease of setting them, all affect the total set-up time. An extremely robust and efficient performanc...|$|R
