Unlike negroes in general, his features were cast in a mould <b>which</b> <b>one</b> <b>is</b> <b>more</b> accustomed {{to see in the}} Caucasian race of mankind--the nose being straight, the lips comparatively thin, and the face oval, while his bearing was that of a man accustomed to command.|$|E

In this sense, as we expect a potential endogeneity between quality of life and urban size (growth), we use a simultaneous equation model. We test our model empirically in a local dynamic framework, the province of Barcelona (Spain), in the period 1991 - 2004...|$|R
