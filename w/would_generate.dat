5|$|Although {{there is}} general {{agreement}} that {{the origin of the}} heat as manifested in Io's many volcanoes is tidal heating from the pull of gravity from Jupiter and its moon Europa, the volcanoes are not in the positions predicted with tidal heating. They are shifted 30 to 60 degrees to the east. A study published by Tyler et al. (2015) suggests that this eastern shift may be caused by an ocean of molten rock under the surface. The movement of this magma <b>would</b> <b>generate</b> extra heat through friction due to its viscosity. The study's authors believe that this subsurface ocean is a mixture of molten and solid rock.|$|E

It was decided that creating videos with the film's stars <b>would</b> <b>generate</b> more interest than any commentary about its connection to the Alien films. He also {{said that the}} videos needed to be cool enough to justify their existence, but not so important that their absence from the final film would be an issue for audiences.|$|E
5|$|Despite only {{finishing}} {{fifth in}} the Scottish League in 1955, Hibs {{were invited to participate}} in the first season of the European Cup, which was not strictly based on league positions at that time. Eighteen clubs who were thought <b>would</b> <b>generate</b> interest across Europe and who also had the floodlights necessary to play games at night, were invited to participate. Floodlights had been used at Easter Road for the first time in a friendly match against Hearts on 18 October 1954. Hibs became the first British club in Europe because the Football League secretary Alan Hardaker persuaded Chelsea, the English champions, not to enter.|$|E

In the event that this might fail to happen, Matilda was now Henry's preferred choice, and he declared that she was to be his rightful successor if he should die without a male heir. The Anglo-Norman barons were gathered together at Westminster on Christmas 1126, where they swore in January to recognise Matilda and any future legitimate heir she might have.|$|E
5|$|The ESL {{is renowned}} for sonic {{transparency}} and very low distortion. Its midrange performance is usually described in superlative terms, common to other electrostatic designs. Its sound is tonally neutral, exceptionally spacious, and transient response very fast. A properly configured stereo pair <b>would</b> <b>generate</b> {{a very small}} 'sweet spot' where the sound stage snaps into focus. This led to criticisms of the speaker's directionality which in practice was rarely a problem and {{had the benefit of}} reducing the effects of room resonances.|$|E
5|$|The Savoy Hotel, {{designed}} by the architect Thomas Edward Collcutt, opened in 1889. Financed by profits from The Mikado, {{it was the first}} hotel lit by electric lights and the first with electric lifts. In the 1890s, under its famous manager, César Ritz, and chef Auguste Escoffier, it became a well-known luxury hotel and <b>would</b> <b>generate</b> more income and contribute more to the D'Oyly Carte fortunes than any other enterprise, including the opera companies. Carte later acquired and refurbished Claridge's (1893), The Grand Hotel in Rome (1896), Simpson's-in-the-Strand (1898) and The Berkeley (1900).|$|E

5|$|The {{brothers}} hired external help {{to address}} {{two of their}} initial issues: art and audio. Jamie Churchman, a former colleague at Sidhe, oversaw the visual design for Mini Metro and {{also contributed to the}} game design. They approached American composer Disasterpeace to work on the game's audio. He developed a procedural audio system that <b>would</b> <b>generate</b> sounds based on events in the game. Each level in the game has a corresponding set of rhythms and sounds; the harmonic structure of these elements changes based on {{the size and shape of}} the player's subways system. The audio was inspired by minimalism and the works of Philip Glass and Steve Reich.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of element 108 was first attempted in 1978 by a Russian research {{team led by}} Yuri Oganessian and Vladimir Utyonkov at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, using reactions that <b>would</b> <b>generate</b> the isotopes hassium-270 and hassium-264. The data was uncertain and they carried out new experiments on hassium five years later, where these two isotopes as well as hassium-263 were produced; the hassium-264 experiment was conducted again and confirmed in 1984.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, {{progress}} on the project has been stalled by disagreements between the Wolkoffs {{and the town of}} Islip over the amount the Wolkoffs will spend for the transportation piece of the project, and between the family and labor unions over wages and health care. The town of Islip has stated that the Wolkoffs agreed to spend $75million (2011USD) for the infrastructure improvements; however, the family stated in a September 2011 letter that they would only commit to $27million (2011USD) and that they never agreed to the original figure. Gerald Wolkoff thought that the discrepancy stemmed from his belief that transportation should be funded by the government, not from private sources, as his project <b>would</b> <b>generate</b> tax revenue for the government. Despite the issues surrounding the project, the Heartland project received $2.5million from the State of New York for roadway improvements in December 2011. The funding was part of a $101million (2011USD) package given to Long Island for various economic improvements.|$|E

5|$|Each {{enemy was}} {{designed}} to exhibit a unique behavior toward the character; random elements were programmed into the enemies' behaviors to make the game more interesting. The first two designed were the simplest: Electrodes and Grunts. Electrodes are stationary objects that are lethal to the in-game characters, and Grunts are simple robots that chase the protagonist by plotting the shortest path to him. Grunts were designed to overwhelm the player with large groups. While testing the game with the new control system and the two enemies, Jarvis and DeMar were impressed by the gameplay's excitement and fun. As a result, they began steadily {{increasing the number of}} on-screen enemies to over a hundred to see if more enemies <b>would</b> <b>generate</b> more enjoyment.|$|E
5|$|Early {{polls showed}} that Beshear and Henry led the Democratic field in name recognition, but both trailed Fletcher and his Republican primary rival Anne Northup in that area. Early in the campaign, Beshear {{attempted}} to set himself {{apart from the}} other candidates by supporting a constitutional amendment that would allow expanded casino gambling in the state, which he claimed could generate $500 million in new revenue without the need to raise taxes. Observers noted that this strategy was remarkably {{similar to the one}} used by Wallace Wilkinson who, in his 1987 primary victory over Beshear and others, trumpeted the revenue a state lottery <b>would</b> <b>generate.</b> Initially, all of the Democratic candidates except Hensley endorsed a casino amendment, but as Beshear made it the centerpiece of his campaign, support from other candidates began to waver; Richards officially changed his position to oppose the amendment, while several other candidates charged that Beshear was staking too much of his platform on a proposal that was not guaranteed to pass.|$|E
5|$|Early studies {{reported}} high success rates: {{in one study}} in 1925, 60% of patients became seizure-free, and another 35% of patients had a 50% reduction in seizure frequency. These studies generally examined a cohort of patients recently treated by the physician (what {{is known as a}} retrospective study) and selected patients who had successfully maintained the dietary restrictions. However, these studies are difficult to compare to modern trials. One reason is that these older trials suffered from selection bias, as they excluded patients who were unable to start or maintain the diet and thereby selected from patients who <b>would</b> <b>generate</b> better results. In an attempt to control for this bias, modern study design prefers a prospective cohort (the patients in the study are chosen before therapy begins) in which the results are presented for all patients regardless of whether they started or completed the treatment (known as intent-to-treat analysis).|$|E

5|$|In September 1980, in the {{aftermath}} of the labor agreements, First Secretary Gierek was removed from office and replaced as party leader by Stanisław Kania. Kania made promises of the sort that Gomułka and Gierek had made when each came power. But whatever goodwill the new leader gained, it lasted for an even shorter period than it had been the case in 1956 and 1971, because there was no way that the regime could have kept the promises it had made at Gdańsk, even if it wanted to. The authorities were still trapped by the contradiction: if they followed economic necessity, they <b>would</b> <b>generate</b> political instability. GNP fell in 1979 by 2%, in 1980 by 8% and in 1981 by 15–20%.|$|E
5|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{including a}} distant massive planet were also conducted by other groups. Lawler et al. {{found that the}} dynamical effect of Planet Nine <b>would</b> <b>generate</b> a cloud of objects centered around Planet Nine's semi-major axis, with most at greater semi-major axes. A massive planet in a circular orbit at 250 AU {{increased the number of}} high perihelion objects threefold; one at 500 AU with an eccentricity of 0.5 increased these tenfold, and left a significant fraction with inclinations greater than 60°. Simulations conducted by Nesvorny et al. of the giant planet migration described in the Nice model that included Planet Nine in its nominal orbit yield similar results, with roughly 0.3–0.4 Earth masses of an initial 20 Earth mass planetesimal disk remaining in what they called the Planet Nine cloud {{at the end of a}} simulation of the last 4 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Tri-Star Pictures {{had planned}} to release the film using a {{platform}} technique which involved opening it in select cities before releasing it nationwide. The studio was confident that the limited theatrical run <b>would</b> <b>generate</b> strong-word-of-mouth interest and awards consideration for the film. Birdy opened in limited release on December 21, 1984 in New York City, Los Angeles and Toronto. The film's failure to garner any award nominations during the limited run resulted in Tri-Star cancelling a wide release scheduled for late January 1985. In response, A Films prompted the studio to refocus the film's marketing campaign. Tri-Star adjusted its promotional focus on the friendship between Birdy and Al, while Parker, Modine and Cage heavily promoted the film by personally visiting critics, journalists and radio reporters. Birdy was a box office bomb, grossing only $1,455,045 in the United States and Canada, well below its estimated budget of $12 million.|$|E
