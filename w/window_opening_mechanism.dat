40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Opening windows {{is a common}} method for {{controlling}} air temperature, moisture, air quality and odours in dwellings. Opening a window in winter will increase the heat loss from a house, the additional heat loss {{will depend on the}} size of the <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> and the length of time for which the window is open. However, <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> behaviour is unpredictable, varying widely between different dwellings and occupants making it difficult to incorporate into predictions of energy consumption. This paper reports the results of an investigation to quantify the impact of <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> on the measured air tightness and total heat loss in a detached, timber framed test house built in the year 2000 to contemporary building standards, and located at Loughborough University. Blower door tests were used to measure the increase in ventilation caused by <b>opening</b> <b>windows.</b> The additional heat loss due to this ventilation was predicted using a simple model and then compared to the whole house heat loss as measured by a co-heating test. A linear relationship between <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> area and additional ventilation was found, independent of window location. This relationship was used to quantify the additional heat loss for a variety of <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> behaviours. The results show that <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> does not significantly increase heat loss rates in this particular house for all but the most extreme <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> behaviours. The implications of these results for different types of dwelling are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the effect of <b>window</b> <b>openings</b> on the daylight and solar radiation penetration into rooms. The computer simulation programmes RADIANCE and ECOTECT have been employed for carrying out this research. The house type 36 has been selected for this study. The study shows that the <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> of 10 % of floor area is satisfy the lux level of 120 lux for bedrooms. However, the <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> of 15 % is required to bring daylight level of more than 120 lux for the living room. The differences of <b>window</b> <b>openings</b> requirements between the two rooms were due to the difference {{of the size of}} shading devices. The bigger the shading device the bigger <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> required. The orientation plays significant impact on solar radiation penetration in the room with a small shading device. However, orientation has no significant impact on the solar radiation penetration in the well shaded area...|$|R
40|$|Occupant <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> {{behaviour}} {{has become}} of increasing concern {{because of the}} role windows play in controlling ventilation and hence in building energy consumption. Previous studies (in different countries, climates, buildings and room types and over different observation periods) have shown a general trend that <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> is related to weather conditions, indoor temperature and some non-environmental conditions. However, seeking {{to reduce the amount}} of energy lost through ventilation and infiltration can be conflicting with the need to maintain high indoor air quality (IAQ) levels. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) which is an occupant generated pollutant and also a good indicator of ventilation and IAQ is known to have negative physiological impacts on occupants. It is therefore important to seek to understand occupants’ interaction with building controls in response to changes in IAQ as well as changes in thermal conditions. The work described in this thesis is focussed on <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> behaviour of occupants in university buildings. The influence of indoor and outdoor environmental variables on <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> will be assessed. Also the influence of CO 2, as an indicator of IAQ, on <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> will be considered. Field observations were conducted in two naturally ventilated office buildings over three different seasons. Window states, window state changing events and environmental data were measured during the survey periods. An experiment with controlled conditions was also conducted to investigate the influence of CO 2 concentration in different thermal conditions. This was achieved by observing participants window use in environments with pre-set CO 2 and temperature conditions. Results from these studies confirmed that <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> behaviour is heavily influenced by temperature. However, temperature alone did not explain all the variance in the observed behaviour. Differences were found in behaviour at different times of the day and in different seasons as different combinations of variables affected <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> at different times. From the experiment, it was found that perceived environment was also significantly associated with <b>window</b> <b>opening.</b> Based on the observations made in this study, models for <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> were generated for both indoor and outdoor temperature. These were compared with models from previous studies and it was shown that there is a range in the prediction of <b>window</b> <b>opening.</b> The comparison highlighted the disparities between the <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> models and questions the generalizability and reliability of the models, highlighting the need to consider the effects of a wider range of variables...|$|R
40|$|A {{method of}} {{defining}} occupants' <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> behaviour patterns in simulation programs, based on measurements is proposed. Occupants' <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> behaviour {{has a strong}} effect on indoor environment and the energy consumed to sustain it. Only few models of <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> behaviour exist and these are solely based on the thermal indoor/outdoor environment. Consequently, users of simulation software are often left {{with little or no}} guidance for the modelling of occupants' <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> behaviour, resulting in potentially large discrepancies between real and simulated energy consumption and indoor environment. Measurements of occupant's <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> behaviour were conducted in 15 dwellings in Denmark during eight months. Indoor and outdoor environmental conditions were monitored in an effort to relate the behaviour of the occupants to the environmental conditions. The dwellings were categorized in four groups according to ventilation type (natural/mechanical) and ownership (owner-occupied/rented) in order to investigate common patterns of behaviour. Logistic regression was used to infer the probability of opening and closing a window. The occupants' <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> behaviour was governed by different but distinct habits in each dwelling. However, common patterns were also identified in the analysis: Indoor CO 2 concentration (used as indicator of indoor air quality) and outdoor temperature were the two single most important variables in determining the <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> and closing probability, respectively. The models could be implemented into most simulation programs, which would enable a better chance of mimicking the behaviour of the occupants in the building and thus simulating the indoor environment and energy consumption correctl...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThermal comfort is an {{imperative}} {{factor that}} determines {{the health and}} productivity of the occupants living in residential buildings. The growing health related symptoms and demand for the electrical energy encourage the occupants to switch over to natural ventilation. Thermal comfort for naturally ventilated buildings mainly depends on the size and orientation of <b>window</b> <b>openings.</b> Even though most research works include the study on indoor thermal comfort for various positions of <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> it was limited to single sided and cross ventilated buildings. In real situation most of the rooms attached to the residential buildings are having <b>window</b> <b>openings</b> at their adjacent wall and hence this paper was focused to study the occupants’ thermal comfort and indoor air flow characteristics for a room with adjacent <b>window</b> <b>openings</b> under generalized approach. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) technique is employed to study the indoor air flow for a three-dimensional room model. The CFD simulation is checked for grid independence and having good validation with experimental measurements on the reduced scale model at wind tunnel and with the network model with the k–ε turbulence model. Air temperatures along various midlines, planes, areas occupied by low temperature zone and predicted mean vote (PMV) contours are presented in this paper. From this study {{a new set of}} strategies are identified to locate the <b>window</b> <b>openings</b> and the best location improves percentage of low temperature by 50 %, reduces the PMV and PPD by 0. 12 % and 3. 51 %, respectively with reference to the worst <b>window</b> <b>opening</b> position...|$|R
