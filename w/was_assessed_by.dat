5|$|Dean Lyons {{was born}} on 20 April 1973; he was 24 when he was arrested. He grew up in Tallaght in West Dublin, the fourth {{in a family of}} six children. He went to Scoil Aonghusa National School in Tallaght, where he had some {{difficulty}} with his schoolwork. According to his teachers, in today's terms, he would have been classified as having a moderate general learning disability. He <b>was</b> <b>assessed</b> <b>by</b> a psychologist when he was in sixth class, around the age of twelve, who found him to have an intelligence quotient of 70. As a result of the psychologist's report, Lyons was moved to St. Joseph's Special School in Tallaght. During his period in St. Joseph's, he developed a reputation for attention seeking and storytelling. After school, he never held down a steady job and drifted into heroin addiction and homelessness. At the time of his arrest for the Grangegorman murders, he had one conviction for burglary, and had been involved in a number of syringe robberies.|$|E
5|$|Ashley Smith (born 29 January 1988, New Brunswick, Canada) {{was adopted}} {{when she was}} 5 days old, and {{according}} to her adoptive parents, Coralee Smith and Herbert Gober, had a normal childhood in Moncton, New Brunswick. Between the ages of 13-14, her parents noted distinct behavioural changes in the child; by age 15 she had been before juvenile court 14 times for various minor offences such as throwing crabapples at a mailman, trespassing, and causing a disturbance. In March 2002, Smith <b>was</b> <b>assessed</b> <b>by</b> a psychologist who {{found no evidence of}} mental illness. However, her behavioural problems continued and she was suspended from school multiple times in the fall of 2002. In March 2003, after multiple court appearances, Smith was admitted to the Pierre Caissie Centre for assessment. She was diagnosed with ADHD, learning disorder, borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality traits. She was discharged several days early from the Centre for unruly and disruptive behaviour and returned to the New Brunswick Youth Centre (NBYC). Smith was remanded to the NBYC multiple times over the next 3 years; during this time she was involved in more than 800 reported incidents and at least 150 attempts to physically harm herself.|$|E

Strategies used include bracken rolling, clearing birch scrub and removing some older trees from heathland areas. Grazing with cattle is employed in summer. Tree clearance, has, however, resulted in conflict between the trust and a local residents group, Friends of Bickerton Hill, which organised a protest on the hill in October 2008 against tree felling, especially in the picturesque Cuckoo Rock Valley.|$|E

25|$|Initially {{wine was}} {{distilled}} as a preservation method {{and as a}} way {{to make it easier for}} merchants to transport. It is also thought that wine was originally distilled to lessen the tax which <b>was</b> <b>assessed</b> <b>by</b> volume. The intent was to add the water removed by distillation back to the brandy shortly before consumption. It was discovered that after having been stored in wooden casks, the resulting product had improved over the original distilled spirit. In addition to removing water, the distillation process led to the formation and decomposition of numerous aromatic compounds, fundamentally altering the composition of the distillate from its source. Non-volatile substances such as pigments, sugars, and salts remained behind in the still. As a result, the taste of the distillate was often quite unlike that of the original source.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{prompted}} by a dispute over the annulment of the marriage of Henry VIII to Catherine of Aragon, the Church of England separated from the Roman Catholic Church in 1534, and became the established church by an Act of Parliament in the Act of Supremacy, beginning {{a series of events}} known as the English Reformation. In the same year there was a Visitation of the Monasteries, ostensibly to examine their character, but in fact to value their assets with a view to expropriation. The Valor Ecclesiasticus of 1535, however, was an entirely candid valuation of the income of the monasteries. The Crown was undergoing financial difficulties, and the wealth of the church, allied to its political weakness, made appropriation of church property both tempting and feasible. Shrewsbury Abbey's income <b>was</b> <b>assessed</b> <b>by</b> the Valor at precisely £527 15s. 5¾d. Of this, £414 1s. 3¼d. was contributed by the temporalities; essentially, property rents drawn from estates in 26 manors of Shropshire and seven in other counties.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Survivability {{assessments}} and vulnerability reductions are required in warship design. A warship’s survivability <b>is</b> <b>assessed</b> <b>by</b> its susceptibility, vulnerability, and recoverability. In this paper, an integrated survivability assessment for a warship subjected to multiple hits is introduced. The methodology aims at integrating a survivability assessment into {{an early stage}} of warship design. The hull surface is idealized using typical geometries for RCS (Radar Cross Section) detection probability and susceptibility. The Vulnerability is evaluated by using the shot-line. The recoverability is estimated using a survival time analysis. This enables the variation of survivability to <b>be</b> <b>assessed.</b> Several parameters may be varied to determine their effects on the survivability. The susceptibility <b>is</b> <b>assessed</b> <b>by</b> the probability of detecting the radar cross section of the subject and the probability of being hit based on a probability density function. The vulnerability <b>is</b> <b>assessed</b> <b>by</b> the kill probability based on the vulnerable area of critical components, according to the component’s layout and redundancy. Recoverability <b>is</b> <b>assessed</b> <b>by</b> the recovery time fo...|$|R
