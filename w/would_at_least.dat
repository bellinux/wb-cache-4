5|$|Destroying this {{symbol of}} British naval power {{by means of}} a {{submarine}} <b>would</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> be a blow to British morale and, perhaps, threaten the British blockade and control of New York Harbor. The plan was to have Lee surface just behind Eagles rudder and use a screw to attach an explosive to the ship’s hull. Once attached, Lee would re-enter the water and make his getaway.|$|E

Adornments like the Gevninge helmet fragment would have served to identify the rank of such a person, adding decoration to a helmet meant for more than just protection.|$|E

The deal for the briefcase fell through, but {{the man who had}} promised Dworkin the money gave her the airline ticket anyway, and she returned to the United States in 1972.|$|E

5|$|Aronofsky's debut feature, Pi, {{also written}} as π, {{was shot in}} November 1997. The film was financed in part from $100 {{donations}} from friends and family. In return, he promised to pay each back $150 if the film made money, and they <b>would</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> get screen credit if the film lost money. Producing the film with an initial budget of $60,000, Aronofsky premiered Pi at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, where he won the Best Director award. The film itself {{was nominated for a}} special Jury Award. Artisan Entertainment bought distribution rights for $1 million. The film was released to the public later that year to critical acclaim and it grossed a total of $3,221,152 at the box-office. Pi was the first film to be made available for download on the Internet.|$|E
5|$|However, Kalt {{argues that}} the Vicinage Clause might permit a variety of prosecutorial {{strategies}} that <b>would</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> partially close this loophole. First, the government {{might be able to}} charge other crimes that did not occur exclusively within the Idaho portion of the park (for example, if the defendant(s) conspired elsewhere). Second, the government could charge crimes for which the maximum authorized sentence is six months or less, to which the jury right does not attach. Third, the Clause might permit the government to encourage potential jurors to move into the Idaho portion of the park after the crime. Fourth, the government might argue for a purposive, rather than textualist, interpretation of the Clause by arguing that a jury drawn from elsewhere could satisfy the purposes of the Clause. Kalt also notes that the Vicinage Clause would not protect against civil liability or vigilante justice.|$|E
5|$|England {{travelled}} to Australia and New Zealand {{in early}} 2008 attempting {{to improve on}} their previous visits. In ten ODI matches in Australia against their hosts previously, England had only managed one win, while against New Zealand they had won just three of fifteen contests. England started badly, losing two of their warm-up matches by significant margins, and then falling 21 runs short in the Twenty20 match which opened the series. Taylor top-scored for England in their Twenty20 defeat with 34 runs from 32 balls. She made a similar score in the first ODI match against the hosts, but in the second match both Taylor and Edwards were out for ducks in a heavy defeat for England. After the third match of the series was abandoned without any play, Taylor scored her first half-century of the tour, and shared a century partnership with Edwards to help England secure a 2–1 lead in the series, guaranteeing that they <b>would</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> draw the five-match contest. After Australia won the last ODI to tie the series, the two sides met at the Bradman Oval to play the only Test of the tour. Taylor and Edwards again enjoyed a successful partnership in England's first innings; Taylor scored 79 runs as the pair put on 159 together. She scored an unbeaten half-century in the second innings to help England to retain the Ashes.|$|E

5|$|On 21 July 1645, after Jiangnan {{had been}} superficially pacified, Dorgon issued a most inopportune edict {{ordering}} all Chinese men to shave their forehead and to braid {{the rest of}} their hair into a queue identical to those of the Manchus. The punishment for non-compliance was death. This policy of symbolic submission helped the Manchus in telling friend from foe. For Han officials and literati, however, the new hairstyle was shameful and demeaning (because it breached a common Confucian directive to preserve one's body intact), whereas for common folk cutting their hair was the same as losing their virility. Because it united Chinese of all social backgrounds into resistance against Qing rule, the hair cutting command greatly hindered the Qing conquest. The defiant population of Jiading and Songjiang was massacred by former Ming general Li Chengdong (李成東; d. 1649), respectively on August 24 and September 22. Jiangyin also held out against about 10,000 Qing troops for 83 days. When the city wall was finally breached on 9 October 1645, the Qing army led by Ming defector Liu Liangzuo (劉良佐; d. 1667) massacred the entire population, killing between 74,000 and 100,000 people. These massacres ended armed resistance against the Qing in the Lower Yangtze. A few committed loyalists became hermits, hoping that for lack of military success, their withdrawal from the world <b>would</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> symbolize their continued defiance against foreign rule.|$|E
5|$|Thus, in August 480 BC, {{when the}} Persian army was {{approaching}} Thessaly, the Allied fleet sailed to Artemisium, and the Allied army marched to Thermopylae. Themistocles himself took {{command of the}} Athenian contingent of the fleet, and went to Artemisium. When the Persian fleet finally arrived at Artemisium after a significant delay, Eurybiades, who both Herodotus and Plutarch suggest was not the most inspiring commander, wished to sail away without fighting. At this point Themistocles accepted a large bribe from the local people for the fleet to remain at Artemisium, and used some of it to bribe Eurybiades to remain, while pocketing the rest. From this point on, Themistocles {{appears to have been}} more-or-less in charge of the Allied effort at Artemisium. Over three days of battle, the Allies held their own against the much larger Persian fleet, but sustained significant losses. However, the loss of the simultaneous Battle of Thermopylae to the Persians made their continued presence at Artemisium irrelevant, and the Allies thus evacuated. According to Herodotus, Themistocles left messages at every place where the Persian fleet might stop for drinking water, asking the Ionians in the Persian fleet to defect, or at least fight badly. Even if this did not work, Themistocles apparently intended that Xerxes <b>would</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> begin to suspect the Ionians, thereby sowing dissension in the Persian ranks.|$|E
5|$|Within his Remarks, Staszic did not {{portray the}} life of Jan Zamoyski (1542–1605, {{one of the most}} {{prominent}} statesmen in Polish history); rather, he argued that reforms are needed, and that Zamoyski had already proposed or supported many of them two centuries before. Staszic was a strong partisan of reforms and an ardent advocate for the interests of the lower classes. He advocated the abolition of the serfdom and improvements of the peasants' fate (by granting them land and private rights). He criticised the szlachta (Polish nobility) for inefficient governance, and argued that it showed itself too inept to be allowed to govern alone. He argued for a slight increase in taxes, which should allow the Commonwealth to create an army of 100,000 that <b>would</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> stand a chance against the still-larger armies of its neighbours. Although he preferred republicanism in theory, in the Commonwealth context he agreed that a strengthening of the central (royal) power was the most practical solution for reforming the country, in line with the similar developments elsewhere in Europe. In Remarks he even supported the introduction of an absolute monarchy in Poland.|$|E

25|$|Roosevelt saw the Economic Bill of Rights as {{something}} that <b>would,</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> initially, be implemented by legislation, {{but that did not}} exclude either the US Supreme Court's development of constitutional jurisprudence or amendments to the US Constitution. Roosevelt's model assumed that federal government would take the lead, but that did not prevent states improving their own legislative or constitutional framework beyond the federal minimum. Much of the groundwork had been laid before and during the New Deal but left many of the Second Bill of Rights' aspirations incomplete. Internationally, the same economic and social rights were written into the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948.|$|E
