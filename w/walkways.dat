5|$|The {{forested area}} {{along the banks}} of the River Neris in Žirmūnai and its <b>walkways</b> are a popular {{recreational}} destination for many Vilnians.|$|E
5|$|The bridge had {{temporary}} fencing and new <b>walkways</b> along a six-lane span, with locals {{saying that}} the stone structure fitting into the looks of the scenic Delaware River Valley. The old bridge was demolished after construction completed.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} of the house there is a further terrace, {{surrounded}} by balustrades with views towards the Pynsent Column. There are flagstone <b>walkways</b> leading to panels of lawn, interspaced with topiary spheres. The walkway leads to an area of ornamental shrubs and a woodland garden.|$|E
50|$|A processional <b>walkway</b> is a {{ceremonial}} <b>walkway</b> in use since ancient times. Common functions of a processional <b>walkway</b> are for religious, governmental or celebratory purposes.|$|R
5000|$|This {{design change}} proved fatal. In the {{original}} design, the beams {{of the fourth}} floor <b>walkway</b> had to support only {{the weight of the}} fourth floor <b>walkway,</b> with the weight of the second floor <b>walkway</b> supported completely by the rods. In the revised design, however, the fourth floor beams were required to support both the fourth floor <b>walkway</b> and the second floor <b>walkway</b> hanging from it.|$|R
50|$|The Convention Centre <b>walkway</b> {{system is}} {{connected}} to the Graham Skywalk section by way of a covered <b>walkway</b> spanning St Mary Ave and Hargrave St, connecting cityplace mall to the Delta Hotel and the Convention Centre. The connection between the pre-existing Convention Centre <b>walkway</b> system and the Winnipeg <b>Walkway</b> system was completed in 2010.|$|R
5|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of the plans for the new ballpark, and prior to the 2008 season, more than $1million in upgrades and repairs were made to Greer Stadium. The improvements, which included a new clubhouse for the Sounds and visiting teams beyond the center field wall, improved field lighting, and improvements to restrooms, <b>walkways,</b> and seating, were made {{in order to keep the}} stadium functional for another three to five years.|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} design the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum was {{dominated}} by adjoining utility buildings, which were linked to it by high-level <b>walkways.</b> Tange refined this concept to place the museum prominently at the centre, separate from the utility buildings (only {{one of which was}} subsequently designed by him). In addition to architectural symbolism, he thought it important for the design to centre around the building that houses the information about the atomic explosion.|$|E
5|$|Lam Tin Park {{was built}} along Black Hill in 1991 {{to serve the}} needs of the fast-growing community. It {{consists}} mainly of hiking trails and <b>walkways,</b> with a 5-a-side football pitch and a children's playground. It also serves as an entrance to the Wilson Trail. The whole of Lam Tin and Victoria Harbour can be viewed from the lookout point at the peak of Lam Tin Park.|$|E
5000|$|On July 17, 1981, 114 [...] {{people were}} killed in the hotel when the fourth floor <b>walkway</b> in the atrium {{collapsed}} on the second floor <b>walkway</b> during a tea dance attended by more than 1,300 revelers in the Hyatt Regency <b>walkway</b> collapse. An investigation revealed that tie rods supporting the <b>walkway</b> did not meet Kansas City building codes.|$|R
5000|$|Terminals 4, 5 and 6 are {{connected}} via an airside underground <b>walkway.</b> At Terminal 6 passengers can transfer {{from the above}} ground terminal <b>walkway</b> to the underground <b>walkway</b> to access Terminals 4, 5 and 6.|$|R
50|$|The {{elevated}} concrete <b>walkway</b> {{connects to}} the podium of the City Hall {{at the height of}} its roof and extends {{around the perimeter of the}} square. Staircases connect the <b>walkway</b> to the floor of the square in several locations. On the south side, the <b>walkway</b> extends across Queen Street to the Sheraton Hotel. On the west side, the <b>walkway</b> is connected to the back of the permanent stage, which also serves as a grand staircase. The <b>walkway</b> is closed during winter months.|$|R
5|$|Since {{the early}} 2000s, the Tigné Point {{peninsula}} is being redeveloped by MIDI plc. The British barracks were demolished, and high-rise apartments were built instead. In 2008, MIDI plc also restored the fort {{as part of}} the project. The alterations made by the British, such as the BL gun emplacements, were also repaired, while landscaped gardens and <b>walkways</b> were built on the glacis.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scenes of}} the alien nest were shot at the {{decommissioned}} Acton Lane Power Station in Acton, London. The crew {{thought it was a}} perfect place to film because of its grilled <b>walkways</b> and numerous corridors, but had to spend money to remove asbestos from the station. The Atmosphere Processor set was not dismantled after filming, and was reused in 1989 as the Axis Chemicals set for Batman (1989).|$|E
5|$|The Botanical Gardens of the National Art Gallery {{is popular}} for {{afternoon}} strolls, and is {{noted for its}} orchids and shrubs. It houses a herbarium, a lily studded waterbody, well-planned <b>walkways,</b> and the Watapamu village, representing a typical village of the islands, which is named after the water pump located nearby. An Anthropology Museum is also located in Honiara, which has exhibits of recent origin.|$|E
50|$|The {{convention}} centre {{is connected to}} the Winnipeg <b>Walkway</b> system via an above-ground <b>walkway</b> connection crossing St. Mary Avenue and Hargrave Street to Cityplace mall. The <b>Walkway</b> system also provides convenient access to the MTS Centre.|$|R
5000|$|The Domain Parking Station is a 1,130 space {{car park}} that caters {{predominantly}} for The Art Gallery of NSW patrons, The Domain event attendees, and inner city workers, {{now known as}} [...] "Domain Car Park". The Domain Car Park also houses a moving <b>walkway</b> which takes parkers from the car park {{to the top of}} Hyde Park. The <b>walkway,</b> or travelator, is an impressive 207 metres in length. The Express <b>Walkway</b> features a painted mural {{along the length of the}} <b>walkway</b> that depicts Aboriginal and local scenes, and the <b>Walkway</b> is most likely the longest continuous moving <b>walkway</b> in the Southern Hemisphere and reportedly the third longest in the world.|$|R
25|$|Terminal 1 {{is home to}} the ThyssenKrupp Express <b>Walkway,</b> the world's fastest moving <b>walkway.</b>|$|R
5|$|The paved <b>walkways</b> of Delos {{range from}} simple pebble or chip-pavement constructions to {{elaborate}} mosaic floors composed of tesserae. Most motifs contain simple geometric patterns, while {{only a handful}} utilize the opus tessellatum and opus vermiculatum techniques to create lucid, naturalistic, and richly-colored scenes and figures. Mosaics {{have been found in}} places of worship, public buildings, and private homes, the latter usually containing either an irregular-shaped floor plan or peristyle central courtyard.|$|E
5|$|The {{university}} constructed new residence halls {{during the}} decade, Prout Hall in 1955 and Founders Quadrangle in 1957. The new student center opened in 1958, {{after four years}} of construction at a cost of $2.75 million. In the years 2012-2014, the residence hall was renovated and remodeled. This renovation updated the rooms, bathrooms, lobbies and outside sidewalks and <b>walkways.</b>|$|E
5|$|While the 1976 renovations {{prolonged}} {{the life}} of the 1930s market, by the 1990s the market was once more becoming decrepit. The covers erected in 1976 over the <b>walkways</b> blocked sunlight, leaving much of the market dingy and poorly lit. The <b>walkways</b> themselves, already narrow, were becoming even more restricted as stalls erected external displays and additional weatherproofing. Removable shutters used to secure the stalls overnight were stacked against the sides of the stalls during trading hours, causing further obstruction, while on those stalls fitted with doors the doors opened outwards to maximise the limited space inside the units. In addition, the floors of stalls followed the slope of the hill, a gradient of about 1:12, causing health problems for those market workers who had to stand at this angle for prolonged periods during the day. Norwich City Council decided that these problems needed to be addressed, and in December 2003 invited the public to choose between three proposals for a rebuilt market.|$|E
40|$|Photographic {{postcard}} {{of eight}} men sweeping a <b>walkway</b> {{outside of a}} building. The eight men are on a <b>walkway</b> that squares off around a building. The building {{is on the left}} and the <b>walkway</b> starts at the bottom left corner and extends up the right side.

50|$|The Coastal <b>Walkway</b> is an award-winning, 12.7 km long <b>walkway</b> {{located along}} the coast of New Plymouth, New Zealand. The <b>walkway</b> {{stretches}} from near Port Taranaki, past the central city, through Hickford Park, past Bell Block Beach and to Tiromoana Crescent in Bell Block, north-east of New Plymouth. The <b>walkway</b> runs through a number of bridges, most notably, the Te Rewa Rewa Bridge.|$|R
30|$|It {{does not}} take into account the {{variation}} and state-dependent service time of the <b>walkway</b> (in reality, the walking/travel time of passengers on the <b>walkway</b> depends on the walking speed of passengers as well as on the number of passengers on the <b>walkway).</b>|$|R
5|$|After the {{war ended}} with the defeat of Japan in 1945, the ban on nonessential {{construction}} was lifted, and the state restarted construction and restoration activities in Constitution Square in 1948. These activities included restoring and re-roofing the buildings, adding furniture to the buildings, constructing <b>walkways,</b> erecting signs, and adding landscaping to the park. The restorations were completed in 1955. From 1960 to 1968, the state added a fence around the site, installed a new lighting and diorama system, constructed {{a replica of the}} square's original pillory, and renovated several buildings, including an early 19th-century brick schoolhouse which became the caretaker's residence.|$|E
5|$|As an {{alternative}} to the time-consuming task of creating a breach, an escalade could be attempted to capture the walls with fighting along the <b>walkways</b> behind the battlements. In this instance, attackers would be vulnerable to arrowfire. A safer option for those assaulting a castle was to use a siege tower, sometimes called a belfry. Once ditches around a castle were partially filled in, these wooden, movable towers could be pushed against the curtain wall. As well as offering some protection for those inside, a siege tower could overlook the interior of a castle, giving bowmen an advantageous position from which to unleash missiles.|$|E
5|$|Continued ingress {{of water}} from the roof and from unroofed {{exterior}} <b>walkways</b> above the ceiling level had caused seepage which carried down salts from the building mortar and deposited them on the ceiling through evaporation. In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift. Although discolouration was a serious problem, bubbling was not, because the thinness and transparency of the paint which Michelangelo employed on the greater part of the ceiling permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.|$|E

5|$|In Chinese {{development}} of Lhasa, Barkhor Square was encroached when the <b>walkway</b> around the temple was destroyed. An inner <b>walkway</b> was {{converted into a}} plaza, leaving only a short <b>walkway</b> as a pilgrimage route. In the square, religious objects related to the pilgrimage are sold.|$|R
50|$|There is an {{underground}} <b>walkway</b> {{that connects the}} station to the platform—the only such <b>walkway</b> on the Iizaka Line.|$|R
5|$|Fifteen {{buildings}} {{are open to}} the public as part of the Rancho Camulos Museum, all of which were built before 1930 and are still in their original locations. They were built mostly in Spanish Colonial or Mission Revival styles (the latter is derived from the former). Later buildings were designed in differing architectural styles, more representative of their period of construction. Landscaping features, such as lawns, flower gardens, ornamental trees, and <b>walkways,</b> separate the residential areas from the working portions of the ranch.|$|E
5|$|High winds {{brought down}} {{telegraph}} wires {{and left the}} city almost entirely cut off from communication with outside locations. At Coney Island, the storm completely destroyed many buildings, <b>walkways,</b> piers, and beach resorts. Brighton Beach was hit particularly hard. The raging seas swept inland, washing out tracks of the Marine Railway. Bathing houses were moved a great distance by the cyclone. Near the Sheepshead Bay, Emmons Avenue was heavily damaged. Further to the east, at Greenport, numerous yachts were wrecked and scattered. Corn crops on land were ruined and fruit trees lost their fruits.|$|E
5|$|In the 1920s, {{as part of}} the {{construction}} of what is now the Northern line, the CCE was extended south to Waterloo and Kennington where it was connected to the City & South London Railway. The loop tunnel under the river was abandoned (although the present northbound Northern line platform follows its course) and two new tunnels were bored south. To this day the southbound Northern line platform {{is the only one of}} the four deep level platforms that is not connected to any of the others by deep level <b>walkways.</b> The new extension was opened on 13 September 1926.|$|E

40|$|At present {{they have}} 39 {{streetcar}} stops in Nagasaki City of which 8 stops were connected with <b>walkway</b> bridges. The stairs of a <b>walkway</b> bridge are {{too hard for}} the handicapped to use, so a <b>walkway</b> bridge near Nagasaki University was removed in this August. In this paper the authors introduced this removal work and investigated the consciousness on the removal of <b>walkway</b> bridge of citizens including streetcar users by using questionaire survey. As a result a streetcar stop which is serviceable for the handicapped was discussed to have a gentle slope, roofs, safety fences and other facilities without a <b>walkway</b> bridge...|$|R
3000|$|The {{number of}} {{passengers}} ‘n’ changes on the <b>walkway</b> over the time. As the {{number of passengers}} on the <b>walkway</b> increases, the slower passengers block faster passengers. Thus, higher passenger densities reduce the individual passenger walking speed. The speed is reduced to 0 {{when the number of}} passengers ‘n’ reaches to the capacity of <b>walkway</b> ‘C = 5 LW’. The passenger flow on the <b>walkway</b> can be viewed as stopped when the density of passengers is 5  ped/m 2. [35]. The walking speed variation phenomenon with an increase or {{decrease in the number of}} passenger ‘n’ on the <b>walkway</b> is known as state dependence. Hence, the <b>walkway</b> can be described as a state-dependent queuing system with passenger arrival rate represented by A, state-dependent service rate of the <b>walkway</b> by B([...] n [...]) and the number of servers (available positions/spaces) C to accommodate the maximum C number of passengers, i.e., A/B(n)/C/C queuing system.|$|R
