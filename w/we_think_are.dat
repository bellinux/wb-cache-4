However, the project was eventually abandoned because the original fairy tale was considered too [...] "small". When they were first approached to direct Tangled in 2008, directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard decided {{that it would be}} best [...] "to blow up the scale of the film" [...] and transform it into a [...] "big event", while updating and modernizing the story for a new audience. Flynn was conceived because the directors felt that [...] "Rapunzel needed to get out ... So she needed to meet a guy to take her to where she's going." [...] In the original fairy tale, Rapunzel's love interest is a prince. However, Greno and Howard decided to make him a thief – dubbed [...] "a subtle yet startling twist for Disney" [...] by The New York Times – in order to avoid creating a character who is too [...] "safe", opting for a funnier and [...] "edgier" [...] antihero instead. Greno elaborated, [...] "When you look back at some of the past Disney princes ... {{a lot of them are}} kind of soft and they're not like people <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> that cool," [...] continuing, [...] "They're good guys, so I guess we sort of took that to the other extreme." [...] However, some of the filmmakers themselves were concerned that Flynn was becoming too edgy. Greno revealed that [...] "There were people ... who were a little worried because they were hearing these rumors, 'Well, it's not a prince it's a thief. He's kind of a ladies' man, and he's very arrogant.'" [...] Greno summarized Flynn's conception and development to Orange: ...|$|E

Seeking to build on that growing influence, Hartman and Schlitt turned to youth ministers directly {{at a conference in}} California, asking them how Petra could better aid their ministries. The response: Produce some music that could be better replicated in a church setting. [...] "So we thought, ‘What if we do a CD with worship songs that <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>are</b> cool, but do it Petra style and then provide an accompaniment track for the youth groups?'"

6000|$|My friends, are things, after all, so {{different}} now {{from what they}} were then? Is our case after all so very different from St. Peter's? God and Christ cannot change, for they are eternal--the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever; and if Christ was near St. Peter on the lake of Gennesaret, he is near us now, and here; for in him we live and move and have our being; and he is about our path, and about our bed, and spieth out all our ways: near us for ever, whether we know it or not. And human nature cannot change. There is in us the same heart as there was in St. Peter, for evil and for good. When St. Peter found suddenly {{that it was the}} Lord who was in his boat, his first feeling was one of fear: 'Depart from me for I am a sinful man, O Lord.' And when we recollect at moments that God is close to us, watching all we do, all we say, yea, all <b>we</b> <b>think,</b> <b>are</b> we not afraid, for the moment at least? Do we not feel the thought of God's presence a burden? Do we never long to hide from God?--to forget God again, and cry in our hearts: 'Depart from me; for I am a sinful man, O Lord'? ...|$|E
