5|$|At that time, the {{university}} {{did not offer}} a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) program so Massey undertook a Master of Science (MSc) course, with both experimental and theoretical components. The former, in cooperation with Courtney Mohr, dealt with soft X-ray deflection from metal surfaces; the latter with <b>wave</b> <b>mechanics.</b> This involved translating numerous articles from German journals such as Zeitschrift für Physik, Annalen der Physik and Physikalische Zeitschrift. His external examiner was Ralph Fowler from the University of Cambridge, who was Paul Dirac's PhD supervisor.|$|E

5|$|Even Born was {{surprised}} to discover that Paul Dirac had been thinking along the same lines as Heisenberg. Soon Wolfgang Pauli used the matrix method to calculate the energy values of the hydrogen atom, and found that they agreed with the Bohr model. Another important contribution was made by Erwin Schrödinger, who looked at the problem using <b>wave</b> <b>mechanics.</b> This {{had a great deal of}} appeal to many at the time, as it offered the possibility of returning to deterministic classical physics. Born would have none of this, as it ran counter to facts determined by experiment. He formulated the now-standard interpretation of the probability density function for ψ*ψ in the Schrödinger equation, which he published in July 1926.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the subject began with the {{development}} in the 19th century of <b>wave</b> <b>mechanics</b> and the exploration of phenomena associated with the Doppler effect. The effect is named after Christian Doppler, who offered the first known physical explanation for the phenomenon in 1842. The hypothesis was tested and confirmed for sound waves by the Dutch scientist Christophorus Buys Ballot in 1845. Doppler correctly predicted that the phenomenon should apply to all waves, and in particular suggested that the varying colors of stars {{could be attributed to}} their motion with respect to the Earth. Before this was verified, however, it was found that stellar colors were primarily due to a star's temperature, not motion. Only later was Doppler vindicated by verified redshift observations.|$|E

25|$|The {{uncertainty}} principle is not readily apparent on the macroscopic scales of everyday experience.

25|$|The {{precision}} {{of the position}} is improved, i.e. reduced σx, by using many plane waves, thereby weakening the {{precision of}} the momentum, i.e. increased σp.

Time-independent perturbation theory was presented by Erwin Schrödinger in a 1926 paper, shortly after he produced his theories in <b>wave</b> <b>mechanics.</b> In this paper Schrödinger referred to earlier work of Lord Rayleigh, who investigated harmonic vibrations of a string perturbed by small inhomogeneities.

25|$|In 1923, the French {{physicist}} Louis de Broglie {{put forward}} {{his theory of}} matter waves by stating that particles can exhibit wave characteristics and vice versa. This theory was for a single particle and derived from special relativity theory. Building on de Broglie's approach, modern quantum mechanics was born in 1925, when the German physicists Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and Pascual Jordan developed matrix mechanics and the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger invented <b>wave</b> <b>mechanics</b> and the non-relativistic Schrödinger equation as an approximation to the generalised case of de Broglie's theory.

25|$|In 1925, a {{new kind}} of {{mechanics}} was proposed, quantum mechanics, in which Bohr's model of electrons traveling in quantized orbits was extended into a more accurate model of electron motion. The new theory was proposed by Werner Heisenberg. Another form of the same theory, <b>wave</b> <b>mechanics,</b> was discovered by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger independently, and by different reasoning. Schrödinger employed de Broglie's matter waves, but sought wave solutions of a three-dimensional wave equation describing electrons that were constrained to move about the nucleus of a hydrogen-like atom, by being trapped by the potential of the positive nuclear charge.|$|E
25|$|Dirac's Principles of Quantum Mechanics, {{published}} in 1930, is a landmark {{in the history}} of science. It quickly became one of the standard textbooks on the subject and is still used today. In that book, Dirac incorporated the previous work of Werner Heisenberg on matrix mechanics and of Erwin Schrödinger on <b>wave</b> <b>mechanics</b> into a single mathematical formalism that associates measurable quantities to operators acting on the Hilbert space of vectors that describe the state of a physical system. The book also introduced the delta function. Following his 1939 article, he also included the bra–ket notation in the third edition of his book, thereby contributing to its universal use nowadays.|$|E
25|$|Atomic orbitals are {{the basic}} {{building}} blocks of the atomic orbital model (alternatively known as the electron cloud or <b>wave</b> <b>mechanics</b> model), a modern framework for visualizing the submicroscopic behavior of electrons in matter.

The repeating periodicity of the blocks of 2, 6, 10, and 14 elements within sections of the periodic table arises naturally from the total number of electrons that occupy a complete set of s, p, d and f atomic orbitals, respectively, although for higher values of the quantum number , particularly when the atom in question bears a positive charge, the energies of certain sub-shells become very similar and so the order in which they are said to be populated by electrons (e.g. Cr = 4s13d5 and Cr2+ = 3d4) can only be rationalized somewhat arbitrarily.|$|E
