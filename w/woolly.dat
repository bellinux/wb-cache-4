5|$|Apart {{from its}} larger size and more {{primitive}} molars, the Columbian mammoth also {{differed from the}} <b>woolly</b> mammoth by its more downturned mandibular symphysis; the dental alveoli (tooth sockets) of the tusks were directed more laterally away from the midline. Its tail was intermediate in length between that of modern elephants and the <b>woolly</b> mammoth. Since no Columbian mammoth soft tissue has been found, much less is known about its appearance {{than that of the}} <b>woolly</b> mammoth. It lived in warmer habitats than the <b>woolly</b> mammoth, and probably lacked many of the adaptations seen in that species. Hair thought to be that of the Columbian mammoth has been discovered in Bechan Cave in Utah, where mammoth dung has also been found. Some of this hair is coarse, and identical to that known to belong to <b>woolly</b> mammoths; however, since this location is so far south it is unlikely to be <b>woolly</b> mammoth hair. The distribution and density of fur on the living animal is unknown, but it was probably less dense than that of the <b>woolly</b> mammoth due to the warmer habitat.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{morphological}} similarities, the Sumatran rhinoceros {{is believed}} to be closely related to the extinct <b>woolly</b> rhinoceros (Coelodonta antiquitatis). The <b>woolly</b> rhinoceros, so named for the coat of hair it shares with the Sumatran rhinoceros, first appeared in China; by the Upper Pleistocene, it ranged across the Eurasian continent from Korea to Spain. The <b>woolly</b> rhinoceros survived the last Ice Age, but, like the <b>woolly</b> mammoth, most or all became extinct around 10,000 years ago. Although some morphological studies questioned the relationship, recent molecular analysis has supported the two species as sister taxa.|$|E
5|$|The Yunnan hare {{is smaller}} than the <b>woolly</b> hare; the supraorbitals are flat and small, and the toothrow and {{diastema}} (space between two teeth) are of different proportions. It also has a characteristic brighter pelage than the <b>woolly</b> hare, although, according to Gao Yaoting, the Yunnan hare's gray rump is also a characteristic of the <b>woolly</b> hare.|$|E
5|$|It was {{formerly}} considered a subspecies of the <b>woolly</b> hare(Lepus oiostolus),but is now {{treated as a}} separate species. Cai and Feng (1982) and Wang(1985) elevated it to species status based on morphological and ecological differences from the <b>woolly</b> hare. In 2005, {{it was found that}} molecular phylogenetics indicated the Yunnan hare and the <b>woolly</b> hare to be sister taxa, and they may exhibit allopatric speciation or parapatric speciation. It might also be related to the Indian hare (Lepus nigricollis) and probably be its northern form.|$|E
5|$|A 2008 genetic {{study showed}} {{that some of the}} <b>woolly</b> mammoths that entered North America through the Bering land bridge from Asia {{migrated}} back about 300,000 years ago and had replaced the previous Asian population by about 40,000 years ago, not long before the entire species became extinct. Fossils of <b>woolly</b> mammoths and Columbian mammoths have been found together in a few localities of North America, including the Hot Springs sinkhole of South Dakota where their regions overlapped. It is unknown whether the two species were sympatric and lived there simultaneously, or if the <b>woolly</b> mammoths may have entered these southern areas during times when Columbian mammoth populations were absent there.|$|E
5|$|Coprinopsis atramentaria is a {{cosmopolitan}} species that is roughly similar in size, color, and stature, {{but does not}} have patchy <b>woolly</b> tufts on the cap like C.variegata.|$|E
5|$|Family Indriidae {{consists}} of the indri (the largest extant lemur), the <b>woolly</b> lemurs and the sifakas. There are 19extant species.|$|E
5|$|Modern humans coexisted with <b>woolly</b> mammoths {{during the}} Upper Palaeolithic {{period when the}} humans entered Europe from Africa between 30,000 and 40,000 years ago. Prior to this, Neanderthals had coexisted with mammoths during the Middle Palaeolithic, and already {{utilised}} mammoth bones for tool making and building materials. <b>Woolly</b> mammoths were very important to ice-age humans, and human survival may have depended on the mammoth in some areas. Evidence for such coexistence was not recognised until the 19th century. William Buckland published his discovery of the Red Lady of Paviland skeleton in 1823, which {{was found in a}} cave alongside <b>woolly</b> mammoth bones, but he mistakenly denied that these were contemporaries. In 1864, Édouard Lartet found an engraving of a <b>woolly</b> mammoth on a piece of mammoth ivory in the Abri de la Madeleine cave in Dordogne, France. The engraving was the first widely accepted evidence for the coexistence of humans with prehistoric extinct animals and is the first contemporary depiction of such a creature known to modern science.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>woolly</b> mammoth populations {{disappeared}} {{during the}} late Pleistocene and early Holocene, alongside most of the Pleistocene megafauna (including the Columbian mammoth). This extinction formed part of the Quaternary extinction event, which began 40,000 years ago and peaked between 14,000 and 11,500 years ago. Scientists are divided over whether hunting or climate change, {{which led to the}} shrinkage of its habitat, was the main factor that contributed to the extinction of the <b>woolly</b> mammoth, or whether it was due to a combination of the two. Whatever the cause, large mammals are generally more vulnerable than smaller ones due to their smaller population size and low reproduction rates. Different <b>woolly</b> mammoth populations did not die out simultaneously across their range, but gradually became extinct over time. Most populations disappeared between 14,000 and 10,000 years ago. The last mainland population existed in the Kyttyk Peninsula of Siberia 9,650 years ago. A small population of <b>woolly</b> mammoths survived on St. Paul Island, Alaska, well into the Holocene with the most recently published date of extinction being 5,600 years B.P. The last known population remained on Wrangel Island in the Arctic Ocean until 4,000 years ago, well into the start of human civilization and concurrent with the construction of the Great Pyramid of ancient Egypt.|$|E
5|$|The Columbian mammoth shared its habitat {{with other}} now-extinct Pleistocene mammals (such as Glyptodon, Smilodon, ground sloths, Camelops and the American mastodon), horses and buffalos. It {{did not live}} in Arctic Canada, which was {{inhabited}} by <b>woolly</b> mammoths. Fossils of <b>woolly</b> and Columbian mammoths {{have been found in}} the same place in a few areas of North America where their ranges overlapped, including the Hot Springs Site. It is unknown whether the two species were sympatric and lived there simultaneously, or if the <b>woolly</b> mammoths entered southern areas when Columbian mammoth populations were absent. The Columbian mammoth coexisted with the other extinct proboscideans Stegomastodon mirificus and Cuvieronius tropicus at sites in Texas and New Mexico during the early Irvingtonian.|$|E
5|$|The {{existence}} of preserved soft tissue remains and DNA of <b>woolly</b> mammoths {{has led to}} the idea that the species could be recreated by scientific means. Several methods have been proposed to achieve this. Cloning would involve removal of the DNA-containing nucleus of the egg cell of a female elephant, and replacement with a nucleus from <b>woolly</b> mammoth tissue. The cell would then be stimulated into dividing, and implanted on a female elephant. The resulting calf would have the genes of the <b>woolly</b> mammoth, although its fetal environment would be different. Most intact mammoths have had little usable DNA because of their conditions of preservation. There is not enough to guide the production of an embryo.|$|E
5|$|The southernmost <b>woolly</b> mammoth {{specimen}} {{known is}} from the Shandong province of China, and is 33,000 years old. The southernmost European remains are from the Depression of Granada in Spain and are of roughly the same age. DNA studies have helped determine the phylogeography of the <b>woolly</b> mammoth. A 2008 DNA study showed there were two distinct groups of <b>woolly</b> mammoths: one that became extinct 45,000 years ago and another one that became extinct 12,000 years ago. The two groups are speculated to be divergent enough to be characterised as subspecies. The group that became extinct earlier stayed {{in the middle of}} the high Arctic, while the group with the later extinction had a much wider range. Recent stable isotope studies of Siberian and New World mammoths have shown there were also differences in climatic conditions on either side of the Bering land bridge, with Siberia being more uniformly cold and dry throughout the Late Pleistocene. During the Younger Dryas age, <b>woolly</b> mammoths briefly expanded into north-east Europe, whereafter the mainland populations became extinct.|$|E
5|$|A second method {{involves}} artificially inseminating {{an elephant}} egg cell with sperm cells from a frozen <b>woolly</b> mammoth carcass. The resulting offspring {{would be an}} elephant–mammoth hybrid, and the process {{would have to be}} repeated so more hybrids could be used in breeding. After several generations of cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure <b>woolly</b> mammoth would be produced. The fact that sperm cells of modern mammals are viable for 15 years at most after deep-freezing is a hindrance to this method. In one case, an Asian elephant and an African elephant produced a live calf named Motty, but it died of defects at less than two weeks old.|$|E
5|$|After {{the last}} ice age only large mammals such as mammoths, bison and <b>woolly</b> {{rhinoceros}} remained. Roughly 11,000years ago, when the ice sheets began to recede, humans repopulated the area; genetic research suggests they came from {{the northern part of the}} Iberian Peninsula. The sea level was lower than now and Britain was connected by land bridge to Ireland and Eurasia.|$|E
5|$|Distortion in the molars is {{the most}} common health problem found in <b>woolly</b> mammoth fossils. Sometimes the {{replacement}} was disrupted, and the molars were pushed into abnormal positions, but some animals are known to have survived this. Teeth from Britain showed that 2% of specimens had periodontal disease, with half of these containing caries. The teeth also sometimes had cancerous growths.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, a well-preserved carcass {{was found}} on Maly Lyakhovsky Island, one of the islands in the New Siberian Islands archipelago, a female between 50 and 60 {{years old at the}} time of death. The carcass {{contained}} well-preserved muscular tissue. When it was extracted from the ice, liquid blood spilled from the abdominal cavity. The finders interpreted this as indicating <b>woolly</b> mammoth blood possessed anti-freezing properties.|$|E
5|$|Mammillaria species tend to grow low to {{the ground}} in solitary or grouped in clusters. The genus is marked by its dimorphic areoles: the spine bearing, or vegetative, areoles are located on the apex of the tubercle, and {{flowering}} areoles are located inside the axils of the tubercles. The stem is <b>woolly</b> and covered with bristles.|$|E
5|$|Megachilid bees of {{the genus}} Anthidium use the hair (amongst that of various <b>woolly</b> plants) in making their nests. The seeds are {{generally}} too small for birds to feed on, although the American goldfinch {{has been reported to}} consume them. Other bird species have been reported to consume the leaves (Hawaiian goose) or flowers (palila), or to use the plant as a source when foraging for insects (white-headed woodpecker).|$|E
5|$|Preserved <b>woolly</b> mammoth fur is orange-brown, {{but this}} is {{believed}} to be an artefact from the bleaching of pigment during burial. The amount of pigmentation varied from hair to hair and also within each hair. A 2006 study sequenced the Mc1r gene (which influences hair colour in mammals) from <b>woolly</b> mammoth bones. Two alleles were found: a dominant (fully active) and a recessive (partially active) one. In mammals, recessive Mc1r alleles result in light hair. Mammoths born with at least one copy of the dominant allele would have had dark coats, while those with two copies of the recessive allele would have had light coats. A 2011 study showed that light individuals would have been rare. A 2014 study instead indicated that the colouration of an individual varied from non-pigmented on the overhairs, bi-coloured, non-pigmented and mixed red-brown guard hairs, and non-pigmented underhairs, which would give a light overall appearance.|$|E
5|$|The Galloway is {{naturally}} hornless, {{and instead of}} horns has a bone knob {{at the top of}} its skull called the poll. This breed's shaggy coat has both a thick, <b>woolly</b> undercoat for warmth and stiffer guard hairs that help shed water, making them well adapted to harsher climates.|$|E
5|$|The {{climate of}} the high desert {{provides}} habitat for mammals such as pronghorn, coyote, mule deer, black-tailed jackrabbit, and cougar. Birds common in the region include sage grouse, California quail, and prairie falcon. The western juniper {{is the most common}} tree in the region, and big sagebrush and common <b>woolly</b> sunflower are the region's most widespread plants.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} {{members of the}} genus Mammuthus are the African species M. subplanifrons from the Pliocene, and M. africanavus from the Pleistocene. The former {{is thought to be}} the {{ancestor}} of later forms. Mammoths entered Europe around 3 million years ago. The earliest European mammoth has been named M. rumanus; it spread across Europe and China. Only its molars are known, which show that it had 8–10 enamel ridges. A population evolved 12–14 ridges, splitting off from and replacing the earlier type, becoming M. meridionalis about 2–1.7 million years ago. In turn, this species was replaced by the steppe mammoth (M. trogontherii) with 18–20 ridges, which evolved in eastern Asia around 1 million years ago. The Columbian mammoth evolved from a population of M. trogontherii that had crossed the Bering Strait and entered North America about 1.5 million years ago; it retained a similar number of molar ridges. Mammoths derived from M. trogontherii evolved molars with 26 ridges 400,000 years ago in Siberia and became the <b>woolly</b> mammoth. <b>Woolly</b> mammoths entered North America about 100,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|The loss {{of species}} from {{ecological}} communities, defaunation, is primarily driven by human activity. This has resulted in empty forests, ecological communities depleted of large vertebrates. In the Quaternary extinction event, the mass die-off of megafaunal variety coincided {{with the appearance of}} humans, suggesting a human influence. One hypothesis is that humans hunted large mammals, such as the <b>woolly</b> mammoth, into extinction.|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} {{scarcity of}} hyena depictions in Paleolithic rock art has been theorised {{to be due}} to the animal's lower rank in the animal worship hierarchy; the spotted hyena's appearance was likely unappealing to Ice Age hunters, and it was not sought after as prey. Also, it was not a serious rival like the cave lion or cave bear, and it lacked the impressiveness of the mammoth or <b>woolly</b> rhino.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} easily {{distinguishable}} from other Chinese hares, having longer ears than the South Chinese Hare. Like the <b>Woolly</b> hare (Lepus oiostolus) and the South Chinese hare, {{an examination of}} the skull shows the groove on the front face of the upper incisors is filled with cement.|$|E
5|$|The <b>woolly</b> mammoth (Mammuthus primigenius) is an {{extinct species}} of mammoth that lived during the Pleistocene epoch, {{and was one}} of the last in a line of mammoth species, {{beginning}} with Mammuthus subplanifrons in the early Pliocene. The <b>woolly</b> mammoth diverged from the steppe mammoth about 400,000 years ago in East Asia. Its closest extant relative is the Asian elephant. The appearance and behaviour of this species are among the best studied of any prehistoric animal because of the discovery of frozen carcasses in Siberia and Alaska, as well as skeletons, teeth, stomach contents, dung, and depiction from life in prehistoric cave paintings. Mammoth remains had long been known in Asia before they became known to Europeans in the 17th century. The origin of these remains was long a matter of debate, and often explained as being remains of legendary creatures. The mammoth was identified as an extinct species of elephant by Georges Cuvier in 1796.|$|E
5|$|A 2011 genetic {{study showed}} that two {{examined}} specimens of the Columbian mammoth were grouped within a subclade of <b>woolly</b> mammoths. This suggests that the two populations interbred and produced fertile offspring. A North American type formerly referred to as M. jeffersonii may be a hybrid between the two species. A 2015 study suggested that the animals in the range where M. columbi and M. primigenius overlapped formed a metapopulation of hybrids with varying morphology. It also suggested that Eurasian M. primigenius had a similar relationship with M. trogontherii, in areas where their range overlapped.|$|E
5|$|A last {{group of}} sheep breeds {{is that of}} fur or hair sheep, which do not grow wool at all. Hair sheep {{are similar to the}} early domesticated sheep kept before <b>woolly</b> breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts. Some modern breeds of hair sheep, such as the Dorper, result from crosses between wool and hair breeds. For meat and hide producers, hair sheep are cheaper to keep, as they do not need shearing. Hair sheep are also more {{resistant}} to parasites and hot weather.|$|E
5|$|Aphids: There {{are five}} species of aphids {{commonly}} found on apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid and the <b>woolly</b> apple aphid. The aphid species {{can be identified}} by their color, {{the time of year}} when they are present and by differences in the cornicles, which are small paired projections from the rear of aphids. Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.|$|E
5|$|Areoles are {{structures}} {{unique to}} cacti. Although variable, they typically appear as <b>woolly</b> or hairy {{areas on the}} stems from which spines emerge. Flowers are also produced from areoles. In the genus Pereskia, believed similar to the ancestor of all cacti, the areoles occur in the axils of leaves (i.e. in the angle between the leaf stalk and the stem). In leafless cacti, areoles are often borne on raised areas on the stem where leaf bases would have been.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, a new {{interchange}} {{was built}} between NY134 and the Taconic State Parkway {{as part of}} the construction of IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center. During the excavation process for the junction, a bone from a <b>woolly</b> mammoth (colloquially known as Jefferson's mammoth) was found buried in the earth below. The bones were moved to the New York State Museum in Albany. The construction also required the relocation of the Kitchawan Tavern from the site of the exit to the junction of Kitchawan and Chadeanye roads a half-mile (0.8km) to the east.|$|E
5|$|L. vellereus {{is larger}} {{with a thick}} stipe, <b>woolly</b> cap and less crowded gills, but is not as tall. Russula delica is similar in colour and shape, though has adnate blue-green tinged gills and no milk. L. deceptivus is also similar, but is {{differentiated}} by its less crowded gills, firmer cap margin and less acrid milk. Close to L. piperatus is L. glaucescens, which is differentiated by its milk that dries with a greenish colour.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius torminosus, {{commonly}} known as the <b>woolly</b> milkcap or the bearded milkcap, is a large agaric fungus. A common and widely distributed species, it is found in North Africa, northern Asia, Europe, and North America. It was first described scientifically by Jacob Christian Schäffer in 1774 as an Agaricus, and later transferred to the genus Lactarius in 1821 by Samuel Frederick Gray. A variety, L.torminosus var. nordmanensis, is known from the United States, Canada, and Switzerland. L.torminosus officially became the type species of Lactarius in 2011 after molecular studies prompted the taxonomic reshuffling of species between several Russulaceae genera.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the larger}} lemur species consume leaves (folivory), {{particularly}} the indriids. However, some smaller lemurs such as sportive lemurs (genus Lepilemur) and <b>woolly</b> lemurs (genus Avahi) also primarily eat leaves, making them the smallest primates that do so. The smallest of the lemurs generally do not eat much leaf matter. Collectively, lemurs have been documented consuming leaves from at least 82 native plant families and 15 alien plant families. Lemurs tend to be selective in their consumption of {{the part of the}} leaf or shoot as well as its age. Often, young leaves are preferred over mature leaves.|$|E
5|$|Some spiders have a cribellum, a {{modified}} spinneret {{with up to}} 40,000 spigots, each of which produces a single very fine fiber. The fibers are pulled out by the calamistrum, a comb-like set of bristles on the jointed tip of the cribellum, and combined into a composite <b>woolly</b> thread that is very effective in snagging the bristles of insects. The earliest spiders had cribella, which produced the first silk capable of capturing insects, before spiders developed silk coated with sticky droplets. However, most modern groups of spiders have lost the cribellum.|$|E
5|$|The {{common earwig}} is an omnivore, eating plants and ripe fruit {{as well as}} {{actively}} hunting arthropods. To a large extent, this species is also a scavenger, feeding on decaying plant and animal matter if given the chance. Observed prey include largely plant lice, but also large insects such as bluebottle flies and <b>woolly</b> aphids. Plants that they feed on typically include clover, dahlias, zinnias, butterfly bush, hollyhock, lettuce, cauliflower, strawberry, blackberry, sunflowers, celery, peaches, plums, grapes, potatoes, roses, seedling beans and beets, and tender grass shoots and roots; they have also been known to eat corn silk, damaging the corn.|$|E
