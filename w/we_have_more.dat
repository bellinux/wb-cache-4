25|$|Unlike {{some other}} barbarian peoples, {{such as the}} Vandals, Visigoths, Ostrogoths and Huns, which played an {{important}} part in Rome's loss of the western provinces, the Sueves—establishing themselves in Gallaecia and northern Lusitania, which were remote and extra-Mediterranean areas—seldom posed a threat to Rome and to Rome's interests; in fact, at times where <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> detailed knowledge of their history through a diversity of sources, that is precisely when they became a challenge, as it was under the reign of Rechila. Anyhow, all along their history as an independent nation, they maintained an important diplomatic activity, most notably with Rome, the Vandals, the Visigoths, and, later, with the Franks. Again, they become an important player during the reign of Miro, in the last third of the 6th century, when they were in coalition with other Catholic powers—the Franks and the Eastern Romans—in support of Hermenegild, and against the Visigothic king Leovigild. Anyhow, because of their relative isolation and remoteness, sources about the Suevi people are limited, with the number translated into English even fewer.|$|E

[...] They also published a cartoon by Thomas Rowlandson entitled [...] "A Charm for a Democracy, Reviewed, Analysed, & Destroyed". However, scholars attribute the end of Johnson and Christie's journal to Johnson's trial for seditious libel and the ensuing negative publicity, in addition to the deaths of Christie and Wollstonecraft in 1796 and 1797 respectively.|$|E

500|$|The Beauty Process: Triple Platinum is the {{follow-up}} to L7's 1994 album Hungry for Stink, which {{was released by}} Slash Records in collaboration with Reprise Records, a major record label owned by the Warner Music Group. Hungry for Stink peaked at No. 172 on the US Billboard Top 200 chart and coincided with the 1994 Lollapalooza music festival, where the band shared the stage with other successful acts including The Smashing Pumpkins and The Breeders. For their next album, L7 {{decided to take a}} less constrained approach than they took with their previous albums. According to singer and guitarist Donita Sparks, [...] "In the past, I think we wanted to prove that we were tough cookies. We wanted to show that we could rock harder than anyone. Now we're more secure. So <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> freedom. It's kind of liberating." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{previous}} year's {{race was}} watched by seven million viewers in the United Kingdom alone. [...] Oxford coach Dan Topolski suggested {{that part of}} the appeal was that the contest was [...] "absolutely amateur" [...] but still [...] "represents quality". [...] Former Oxford Blue and Olympic gold medallist Jonny Searle agreed, calling the Boat Race [...] "a unique experience". [...] Both Topolski and Searle predicted a close race; Cambridge coach Robin Williams agreed: [...] "We've got to accord Oxford some respect. [...] I think we're again the better crew ... but the only way to find out is on the water." [...] Penny Chuter, one of the other Oxford coaches, noted [...] "Cambridge have a continuity ... but <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> power this year." [...] Cambridge's boat club president John Carver had earlier withdrawn from the race with injury. [...] Oxford's director of rowing, Steve Royle, said of his crew: [...] "these guys love a scrap." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Beautiful Liar" [...] {{was written}} by Mikkel S. Eriksen, Tor Erik Hermansen, Amanda Ghost, Ian Dench, and Beyoncé. It was {{produced}} by Eriksen and Hermansen using their stage name, Stargate, and Beyoncé. Eriksen told Sound on Sound, [...] "This song is very simple. Most of the time <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> chords in a song, because we find it hard writing a great song on just one chord. But {{if you do it}} right, you can make it work, and this song is an example." [...] The track had already been written in 2006. Eriksen and Hermansen played it to their manager, Tyran Smith, who said that it would be perfect for a duet between Shakira and Beyoncé. Eriksen and Hermansen considered this to be impossible, however Smith was devoted to that idea. As they had no lyric or top melody, various writers attempted to finish the song. The first three attempts were not satisfactory, and Smith put Eriksen and Hermansen to work together with Ghost and Dench, who wrote {{a significant part of the}} lyrics and the melody.|$|E

[...] He also stated that, after the September 11 attacks, the debate in the United States was [...] "will <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> security with less privacy, or less security with more privacy?"

2500|$|Although {{not officially}} confirmed, Ralf Hütter {{suggested}} that a second boxed set of their first three experimental albums—Kraftwerk, Kraftwerk 2 and Ralf and Florian—could be on its way, possibly seeing commercial release after their next studio album: [...] "We've just never really taken {{a look at those}} albums. They've always been available, but as really bad bootlegs. Now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> artwork. Emil has researched extra contemporary drawings, graphics, and photographs to go with each album, collections of paintings that we worked with, and drawings that Florian and I did. We took a lot of Polaroids in those days." [...] Kraftwerk also released an iOS app called Kraftwerk Kling Klang Machine. The Lenbach House in Munich exhibited some Kraftwerk 3-D pieces in Autumn 2011. Kraftwerk performed three concerts to open the exhibit.|$|E

Marcus Trescothick, the Somerset captain, who only made 11 said, [...] "Conditions were not conducive to one-day cricket, that's for sure.

2500|$|The album's artwork is {{designed}} by Martin Kvamme, {{who has worked}} with A-ha on previous occasions, both as a band and on solo projects. Stian Andersen, Guy Berryman, Istockphoto and Helge Kvamme supplied photographs for the inner sleeve. Martin Kvamme said the following about the inspiration behind the cover art: [...] "In this case the title helped quite a lot. I know that this is a somehow poetic quote and that they are not necessarily talking about a mountain, but we wanted something majestic and simple. That's also why we made it quite abstract. It's a picture of the mountain Kyrkja (the church) in Jotunheimen, Norway. Inside <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> images of Norwegian nature (in a collage style). But in general I guess the inspiration comes from the overall idea (production and songwriting/lyrics), rather than the album title." ...|$|E

2500|$|Finally, the {{nomination}} was decided by delegates under the Democratic Party's rules, so the candidates campaigned {{to maximize their}} delegate advantage. If {{the nomination}} were decided by popular vote, they likely would have campaigned differently, in order to run up the vote in populous states like New York and Illinois. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi {{has said that the}} popular vote should have no effect under the current rules: [...] "It’s a delegate race. The way the system works is that the delegates choose the nominee." [...] Obama's chief strategist suggested that the Clinton campaign's focus on the popular vote was a distraction tactic: [...] "When they started off, it was all about delegates.... Now that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>more</b> delegates, it’s all about the popular vote. And if that does not work out, they will probably challenge us to a game of cribbage to choose the nominee."
