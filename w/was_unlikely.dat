5|$|Brewer was not {{resigned}} by the Maple Leafs {{and released}} {{as a free}} agent on July 1, 2015. He spent the entire summer training in hopes of landing an NHL job but realized by mid-August that he <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> to find a team interested in his services. He has since quietly retired.|$|E
5|$|On 5 September 1939, as {{it became}} clear that Poland <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> to halt the ongoing German invasion, BS-4 {{received}} orders to destroy part of its files and evacuate essential personnel.|$|E
5|$|A German {{victory on}} the Battle of Britain Day <b>was</b> <b>unlikely.</b> It {{could only have}} been {{possible}} if Park had made crass errors and had been caught on the ground. Stephen Bungay postulates that had the loss rates been reversed, Dowding could have replaced those with reinforcements from his C units and carried on. Moreover, during both major engagements Fighter Command had used less than ½ of its strength. It {{would have been able to}} meet the Luftwaffe again on the morrow.|$|E

5|$|Although Sarah {{implied that}} she had {{encouraged}} the escape {{for the safety of}} Princess Anne, {{it is more likely that}} she was protecting herself and her husband. If James succeeded in defeating Prince William of Orange in battle he might imprison and even execute Lord and Lady Churchill for treason, whereas it <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> he would condemn his daughter to a similar fate. But James fled to France in December 1688 rather than confront the invading army, allowing William to take over his throne.|$|E
5|$|As Leighton <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> to be dislodged, Ferguson {{promised to}} find Gunn another club, and {{fulfilled}} his pledge when he sold him for £100,000 to Norwich City in October 1986. The transfer nearly went {{through in the}} summer of 1986, but Ferguson delayed the move until October to allow time for Leighton to recover from an injury.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{remained}} at court until October, apparently restored to favour. In {{the absence of}} any children, Philip was concerned that one of the next claimants to the English throne after his sister-in-law was the Queen of Scots, who was betrothed to the Dauphin of France. Philip persuaded his wife that Elizabeth should marry his cousin Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy, to secure the Catholic succession and preserve the Habsburg interest in England, but Elizabeth refused to comply and parliamentary consent <b>was</b> <b>unlikely.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following the 2007 season, the Mets {{began to}} discuss trading Humber to the Minnesota Twins {{in a package}} of {{prospects}} to acquire two-time Cy Young Award-winning pitcher Johan Santana. Eligible to become {{a free agent after}} the 2008 season, Santana had rejected a proposed four-year, $80 million contract extension from the Twins. Assuming that he <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> to resign with Minnesota, the Twins began to shop him to other MLB teams.|$|E
5|$|In November 2016, Manning made {{a formal}} {{petition}} to President Obama to reduce her 35-year sentence {{to the six}} years of time she had already served. On December 10, 2016, a White House petition to commute her sentence reached the minimum 100,000 signatures required for an official response. Lawyers familiar with clemency applications stated in December 2016 that the pardon <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> to happen; the request did not fit into the usual criteria.|$|E
5|$|On February 13, 1994, State Judicial Police arrested Puentes Pizaña in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, on a {{car theft}} charge. In an {{interview}} the following day, {{he said he was}} not guilty of Fischer's murder, and claimed he was at his mother's house in Matamoros when the murder occurred. He insisted that neither he nor Olivarez were gun owners or users. U.S. officials noted that it <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> for Mexico to extradite Puentes Pizaña since the extradition treaty between both countries did not cover Mexican nationals, and because Texas has the death penalty, which is outlawed in Mexico. Reynosa officials stated that Puentes Pizaña would have to face charges in Mexico before an extradition could be considered. Car theft sentences ranged from three to ten years in prison. Puentes Pizaña, on the other hand, argued that facing trial in the U.S. would not guarantee a fair trial. South Texas officials stated that there was a possibility for Puentes Pizaña to be tried in Mexico for Fischer's murder if an agreement was made between Texan and Tamaulipas state officials, though they said that trying him in the U.S. <b>was</b> <b>unlikely.</b>|$|E

5|$|On the {{following}} day, 9 July, {{a meeting of}} the commanders of the German forces on the northern side of the Kursk salient concluded that a breakthrough on the northern side of the salient <b>was</b> <b>unlikely.</b> Nevertheless, they decided to continue their offensive to maintain pressure and inflict casualties, thereby tying down the Soviet forces there. Any level of success for Operation Citadel now depended on a breakthrough being achieved by 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf on the southern side of the Kursk salient.|$|E
5|$|Opposition to the dam project also {{arose in}} {{concern of the}} dam's cost. Several United States congressmen and fiscal conservatives protested the {{proposal}} {{on the grounds that}} the money that would be spent on its construction would be better used to support other projects. They pointed to the lack of existing infrastructure in the region and said it <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> that enough electricity generated by the dam could be sold at a high enough price to pay for its construction.|$|E

5|$|The Dutch Navy {{would need}} a {{significant}} manpower expansion of 2,800 sailors to crew all of the proposed battleships. The Commission believed that it <b>was</b> <b>unlikely</b> that sufficient Dutch citizens would volunteer, and {{that as a result}} Indonesian sailors should be recruited and trained for service in the NEI. Strong segregation between white and Indonesian sailors was to be maintained to the maximum extent practical for unit efficiency.|$|E
5|$|The final British {{withdrawal}} from Aden {{took place in}} November 1967. Colonel Mitchell and the Argylls arrived back at their Plymouth garrison on 27 November. Unlike all the other battalion commanders from Aden, Mitchell was not decorated, receiving only the Mention in Despatches. In {{the normal course of}} events, an OBE might have been routinely awarded to him. It was indicated to him that further advancement <b>was</b> <b>unlikely.</b> Reports began to circulate to the effect that the Argylls were to be disbanded.|$|E
5|$|The {{postponement}} of Barbarossa {{from the}} initially planned date of 15 May {{to the actual}} invasion date of 22 June 1941 (a 38-day delay) occurred {{for a number of}} reasons.
