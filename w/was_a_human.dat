5|$|The Age of Reason {{provoked}} a hostile reaction from most readers and critics, although {{the intensity of}} that hostility varied by locality. There were four major factors for this animosity: Paine denied that the Bible was a sacred, inspired text; he argued that Christianity <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> invention; his ability to command a large readership frightened those in power; and his irreverent and satirical style of writing about Christianity and the Bible offended many believers.|$|E

25|$|The novel claims Constantine wanted Christianity {{to unify}} the Roman Empire but thought it would appeal to pagans only if it {{featured}} a demigod similar to pagan heroes, so he destroyed the Gnostic Gospels that said Jesus <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> prophet and promoted the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, which portray Jesus as divine.|$|E

25|$|In their brief, the Bar of Human Rights Committee and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers {{argued that}} the {{shackling}} of Deck <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> rights violation. It was also {{argued that the}} shackles violated due process and common law and that the shackles diminished courtroom dignity. Additionally, it was argued that the shackles contributed to self-incrimination, and prevented Deck from confronting witnesses against him.|$|E

25|$|The wealthy socialite Helen Brach <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> victim. Brach was {{a millionaire}} candy company heiress and animal lover who {{vanished}} in 1977 {{at the age}} of 65. While her body was never found, she was declared dead in 1984. Investigators suspected that she was murdered because she threatened to reveal what she knew about the over-valuing of horses, which would have led authorities to the string of horse killings perpetrated by Richard Bailey, a man who was later indicted for a role in her murder.|$|E

25|$|While Polish {{commentators}} saw Putin's {{participation in}} the ceremony held on April 7 as a symbolic gesture, they were touched when Putin and Tusk paid tribute and laid flowers {{at the site of}} the crash. Tusk knelt and briefly hid his face in his hands, then stood up as Putin patted him on the shoulder. The two hugged, then gave a joint press conference on the investigation into the crash. Polish commentators noted this <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> gesture, and a display of emotion that Poles had longed to see from their eastern neighbours.|$|E

25|$|In June 2007, Beyond Belief, an {{exhibition}} of Hirst's new work, opened at the White Cube gallery in London. The centre-piece, a Memento Mori titled For the Love of God, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> skull recreated in platinum and adorned with 8,601 diamonds weighing a total of 1,106.18 carats. Approximately £15,000,000 worth of diamonds were used. It was modelled on an 18th-century skull, but the only surviving human {{part of the original}} is the teeth. The asking price for For the Love of God was £50,000,000 ($100million or 75million euros). It didn't sell outright, and on 30 August 2008 was sold to a consortium that included Hirst himself and his gallery White Cube.|$|E

25|$|Although there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> {{presence}} in the Caille region in antiquity, {{it was not until}} the late 15th century that the name of Caille is mentioned in official documents as Calha. Two large families were recorded in the region; 'De Castellane' (of Castellane) and 'Brun de Castellane' (Brown of Castellane). From the 17th to 18th century, the ruling family of Caille were 'Théas'. In January 1790, the National Constituent Assembly created the department of Caille, which included the 11 cantons of Séranon. On the 6th of November 1801, when the number of Cantons was reduced, it was included in the canton of St. Auban.|$|E
25|$|The Hillsborough {{disaster}} <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> crush at Hillsborough {{football stadium}} in Sheffield, England on 15 April 1989, during the 1988–89 FA Cup semi-final game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. The resulting 96 fatalities and 766 injuries makes this the worst disaster in British sporting history. The crush {{occurred in the}} two standing-only central pens in the Leppings Lane stand, allocated to Liverpool supporters. Shortly before kick-off, {{in an attempt to}} ease overcrowding outside the entrance turnstiles, the police match commander, chief superintendent David Duckenfield, ordered exit gate C to be opened, leading to an influx of even more supporters to the already overcrowded central pens.|$|E
25|$|The Paviland {{limestone}} caves of the Gower Peninsula {{in south}} Wales {{are by far}} the richest source of Aurignacian material in Britain, including burins and scrapers dated to about 28,500 years ago. The first remains of modern humans, Homo sapiens sapiens to be found in Wales was the famous Red Lady of Paviland. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> skeleton dyed in red ochre discovered in 1823 in one of the Paviland caves. Despite the name, the skeleton is actually that of a young man who lived about 33,000 years ago {{at the end of the}} Upper Paleolithic Period (old stone age). He is considered to be the oldest known ceremonial burial in Western Europe. The skeleton was found along with fragments of small cylindrical ivory rods, fragments of ivory bracelets and seashells.|$|E

25|$|Following the CT {{scan of the}} Younger Lady, more {{detailed}} descriptions of the mummy have been published. A large defect in the anterior wall of the Lady's chest, and the disarticulation of the right upper limb (arm) are the main indications that the body suffered mutilation by ancient tomb robbers. Otherwise the mummy has been fairly preserved. Despite previous disputes about the Lady's gender, the morphology of the skull and pelvis confirms that she <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> female (woman). The condition of the epiphyseal union and {{the closure of the}} cranial sutures suggest that the Lady was between 25 and 35-years-old {{at the time of her}} death. The Lady's height was 1,58 meters from the vertex to the heel. Her left humerus was 29.3 centimeters in length. Her left femur was 40.5 centimeters in length. Her left tibia was 35.2 centimeters in length.|$|E
25|$|The {{religions}} both share {{a belief}} in the virgin birth of Jesus, his miracles and healings, and that he ascended bodily into heaven. However, Jesus is not accepted as the son by Muslims, who strictly maintain that he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>human</b> being who was loved by God and exalted by God to ranks of the most righteous. They believe in God as a single entity, not as the Trinity accepted by the vast majority of Christians. Neither do Muslims accept Jesus' crucifixion. Since Muslims believe only in the worship of a strictly monotheistic God who never assumed human flesh, they do not accept the use of icons, and see this as shirk (idolatry). Muslim influence played a part in the initiation of iconoclasm and their conquests caused the iconoclasm in the Byzantine Empire. For the same reason, they do not worship or pray to Muhammad, Jesus, or any other prophets; only to God.|$|E
