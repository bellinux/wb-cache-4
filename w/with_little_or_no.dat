5|$|AAC {{systems for}} this {{population}} generally begin with communication boards and/or object or picture exchanges such as the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS). A 2009 descriptive review provided preliminary evidence that PECS is easily learned by most individuals with autism, provides communication to those <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> functional speech, and has some limited positive impact on social interaction and challenging behaviours. A study that compared {{the use of a}} speech generating device to a picture exchange system found that both were reasonable options for children with autism, as the ease and speed of acquisition of each system was similar.|$|E

This commonly involves Bacillus thuringiensis (also called BT), a gram-positive, soil dwelling bacterium.

5|$|In humans, bites {{from this}} species can produce severe local and {{systemic}} symptoms. Based {{on the degree}} and type of local effect, bites {{can be divided into}} two symptomatic categories: those <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> surface extravasation, and those with hemorrhages evident as ecchymosis, bleeding and swelling. In both cases there is severe pain and tenderness, but in the latter there is widespread superficial or deep necrosis and compartment syndrome. Serious bites cause limbs to become immovably flexed as a result of significant hemorrhage or coagulation in the affected muscles. Residual induration, however, is rare and usually these areas completely resolve.|$|E
5|$|KFC {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{fast-food}} chains to expand internationally, opening outlets in England, Mexico and Jamaica by the mid-1960s. Throughout the 1970s and 80s, KFC experienced mixed success domestically, as it went through a series of changes in corporate ownership <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> experience in the restaurant business. In the early 1970s, KFC was sold to the spirits distributor Heublein, which was taken over by the R.J. Reynolds food and tobacco conglomerate, which later sold the chain to PepsiCo. The chain continued to expand overseas, and in 1987 KFC became the first Western restaurant chain to open in China.|$|E
5|$|Swedish {{schoolchildren}} tell Bellman {{jokes about}} a person named Bellman, an antihero or modern-day trickster <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> connection to the poet. The first known Bellman joke is in a book from 1835, which quoted a letter written in 1808 by a contemporary of Bellman. 19th century Bellman jokes were told by adults and focused on Bellman's life at court; they often related to sex. In the 20th century, the 'Bellman' character became generic, the jokes were told by schoolchildren, and often related to bodily functions. The jokes have been studied by anthropologists and psychologists since the 1950s.|$|E

5|$|According to Karl James, no {{detailed}} {{orders were}} produced {{for the attack}} and deliberate planning was hastily completed <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> co-ordination between the attacking infantry regiments. In addition, to {{increase the size of}} the infantry force, troops from the field artillery regiment were quickly re-roled as riflemen. In the meantime, the Australians on Slater's Knoll, having been alerted to the possibility of a large-scale attack began adjusting their defences. The soldiers cleared fields off fire and set out clear engagement areas to the north, northwest and south of the knoll, to allow maximum effectiveness of their supporting Vickers medium machine guns and Bren light machine guns. Barbed wire was laid out, and booby traps set.|$|E
5|$|Education was {{provided}} for the children, but workhouse teachers were a particular problem. Poorly paid, without any formal training, and facing large classes of unruly children <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> interest in their lessons, few stayed in the job {{for more than a}} few months. In an effort to force workhouses to offer at least a basic level of education, legislation was passed in 1845 requiring that all pauper apprentices should be able to read and sign their own indenture papers. A training college for workhouse teachers was set up at Kneller Hall in Twickenham during the 1840s, but it closed in the following decade.|$|E

5|$|Gladiators {{were trained}} combatants {{who might be}} slaves, convicts, or free volunteers. Death was not a {{necessary}} or even desirable outcome in matches between these highly skilled fighters, whose training represented a costly and time-consuming investment. By contrast, noxii were convicts sentenced to the arena <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> training, often unarmed, and with no expectation of survival. Physical suffering and humiliation were considered appropriate retributive justice for the crimes they had committed. These executions were sometimes staged or ritualized as re-enactments of myths, and amphitheatres were equipped with elaborate stage machinery to create special effects. Tertullian considered deaths in the arena {{to be nothing more}} than a dressed-up form of human sacrifice.|$|E
5|$|Historian R. E. Smith {{notes that}} there was a need to raise {{additional}} legions in an emergency to repel specific strategic threats. He argues that this may have resulted in two types of legion. Long-standing legions deployed overseas were probably professional troops forming a standing army. Quickly-formed new legions, in contrast, consisted of younger men, perhaps <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> military experience, who hoped for adventure and plunder. However, no distinction in basic pay, discipline or armour is known of between the two types of legion. The practice of veteran troops signing up again voluntarily into newly raised legions must have meant that no one army conformed exactly to one or other of these theoretical archetypes.|$|E
5|$|It {{remains unclear}} {{precisely}} why Steuart {{was reluctant to}} pursue Banks' defeated army more vigorously, and contemporary records shed little light on the matter. It may be that his thirteen years' training as a cavalry officer led him to obey orders to the letter, <b>with</b> <b>little</b> <b>or</b> <b>no</b> room for personal initiative or variation from strict due process. No charges were brought against him however, despite Jackson's reputation as a stern disciplinarian. It is possible that Jackson's leniency {{had to do with}} the strong desire of the Confederacy to recruit Marylanders to the Southern cause, and the need to avoid offending Marylanders who might be tempted to join Lee's army.|$|E

The various membranes that enclose the other subcellular organelles must therefore be constructed by transfer of lipids from these sites of synthesis.
