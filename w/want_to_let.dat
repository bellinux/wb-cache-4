25|$|Collaboration {{is a way}} to get {{everyone}} involved in the group by assigning each member special, meaningful tasks. It is a way for the group members to share the knowledge and the tasks to be fulfilled unfailingly. For example, if Sally and Paul were loafing because they were not given specific tasks, then giving Paul the note taker duty and Sally the brainstorming duty will make them feel essential to the group. Sally and Paul will be less likely to <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the group down, because they have specific obligations to complete.|$|E
25|$|The Angel of Darkness was {{originally}} {{the first game}} in a trilogy, with its sequel titled The Lost Dominion. While The Lost Dominion was undergoing preliminary development, the negative reception of The Angel of Darkness caused the entire trilogy to be scrapped. With Eidos' approval, Core Design began development of an updated edition of the first game for the PSP called Tomb Raider: The Anniversary Edition in late 2005, with a projected release date of Christmas 2006. Development continued while Core Design staff {{were working on the}} platformer Free Running. When Core Design was sold to Rebellion Developments, Eidos requested the project’s cancellation. It was suggested by staff that Eidos did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> outside developers handle the franchise.|$|E

25|$|After {{passing through}} the vestibule, Dante and Virgil reach the ferry that will take them across the river Acheron and to Hell proper. The ferry is piloted by Charon, who does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Dante enter, for he is a living being. Virgil forces Charon to take him by declaring, Vuolsi così colà dove si puote / ciò che si vuole ("It is so willed there where is power to do / That which is willed"), {{referring}} {{to the fact that}} Dante is on his journey on divine grounds. The wailing and blasphemy of the damned souls entering Charon's boat contrast with the joyful singing of the blessed souls arriving by ferry in the Purgatorio. The passage across the Acheron, however, is undescribed, since Dante faints and does not awaken until he is on the other side.|$|E
25|$|On 14 February, 2008 General James Cartwright, the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made {{a public}} {{announcement}} that the U.S. intended {{to shoot down}} USA-193. In this announcement he laid out several criteria into when, {{how and why the}} satellite would be shot down. The major objective was to reduce the risk to space, air and terrestrial platforms. He explained that they would wait for the shuttle to land, so the potential harm to the shuttle would not be a factor. Next they wanted to wait until the satellite was close to re-entry, this would limit the amount of space debris created. Finally, they did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> the satellite enter the earth’s atmosphere because of its non-aerodynamic characteristics, which would make it extremely hard to intercept. He suggested that these criteria gave them an eight-day window.|$|E
25|$|Gruffudd died in 1269 or 1270 and {{the castle}} passed {{down to his}} four sons. Madoc the eldest son was the senior, but each of the sons may have had apartments at the castle. The peace between Llywelyn and Edward {{did not last long}} and in 1276 war started between England and Wales. Edward's larger armies soon invaded Wales and the support for Llywelyn crumbled. Two of the {{brothers}} made peace with Edward, the second brother Llywelyn and Madoc. However, the castle was not in Madoc's control as the surrender document with the English refers to conditions relating to the recapture of Dinas Brân. Meanwhile, Henry de Lacy, Earl of Lincoln arrived in Oswestry with forces to capture Dinas Brân. As soon as he had arrived he was told that the defenders of the castle, probably the younger brothers Owain and Gruffudd - who were still allies of Llywelyn Prince of Wales, had set fire to and abandoned the castle. The reason for this action is not clear but it may be that they had no confidence that they could defend the castle against the English forces, and did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> it fall intact into Edward's, or their elder brother's hands. The castle was not badly damaged, the fire being mainly limited to the timber structures within the walls and Lincoln recommended to King Edward that the castle be repaired and garrisoned with English troops. Edward placed some troops at the castle at least into the next year 1277 when Llywelyn sued for peace and ordered some repair work to be undertaken.|$|E

500|$|One of Usher's {{first steps}} in {{recording}} Confessions was deciding to reveal [...] "his own little secrets".

500|$|Corey Moss, {{writing for}} MTV News opined that {{the song was}} {{possibly}} [...] "even more depressing" [...] than Nirvana's eponymous song from 1992. Rolling Stones Rob Sheffield described [...] "Lithium" [...] as Lee's ode to Kurt Cobain. In his review of The Open Door, Andy Gill from The Independent listed [...] "Lithium" [...] {{as one of the}} album's standout tracks; he further noted that it perfectly captures the album's mood [...] "wreathed in the genre staples of black-clad, mascara'd gloom" [...] through lyrics such as [...] "I want to stay in love with my sorrow/ Oh, but God I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> it go". Stephen Thomas Erlewine highlighted the [...] "churning" [...] song as one of the three best on the album. He felt that it was reminiscent of the tracks prevalent on the band's debut album, characterized by similarity to Tori Amos's material and observed that on The Open Door, this type of songs were [...] "ushed to the background". In an album review, Sara Berry from St. Louis Post-Dispatch opined that [...] "The band deftly balances scorching rock anthems with reflective, piano-heavy ballads like 'Lithium'".

500|$|As {{the tour}} went on, there was {{discussion}} {{at a high}} level over Jardine's future. The M.C.C. authorities had realised that Bodyline was dangerous and should not be continued, but some figures such as Lord Hawke did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> Jardine down. Australians saw him as more of a problem; the likes of Alexander Hore-Ruthven wanted guarantees that Jardine would not use Bodyline and even that he not play. Plum Warner also believed that Jardine should no longer captain. Jardine himself saved the English selectors from any possible dilemma. In March 1934, he first told Surrey that he would be unable to play regularly any more and he resigned as captain. Then in an announcement in the Evening Standard, he stated that [...] "I have neither the intention nor the desire to play cricket against Australia this summer." [...] It is unclear whether this was due to the pressure over Bodyline, over assurances that the M.C.C. may have asked him to give or simply due to financial worries. This decision effectively ended his first-class career. He never played another Test and played only two more first-class matches in England, in 1937 and 1948, and one in India in 1943–44.|$|E

The company was expected to take the opposite approach to Marvel, releasing individual films for the characters after they have appeared in a team-up film. The release of Man of Steel in 2013 was intended to be {{the start of a new}} shared universe for DC, [...] "laying the groundwork for the future slate of films based on DC Comics."

He noted that the series did have faults, but praised its ambition and Lynch's [...] "gaspingly funny" [...] performance as Sue. Entertainment Weekly Ken Tucker ranked the season ninth out of ten, lauding its novelty, while Lisa Respers France of CNN wrote that despite its [...] "recipe for disaster" [...] premise, the show's charm and bravado were enough to engage audiences. Variety Brian Lowry was critical of the season's early episodes, highlighting acting and characterization issues, stating that the show's talent was squandered by its uneven tone and deeming Glee a one-hit-wonder. Following the mid-season finale, Lowry wrote that while the series still had problems, its musical performances and cast were enough to keep him watching, and despite its issues, [...] "TV would be poorer without Glee." [...] John Doyle of The Globe and Mail criticized the season's development, writing that while early episodes had been enjoyable, the show's success drew focus away from its characters and plot onto celebrity guest stars. Jean Bentley of MTV found the season uneven, writing that {{it began with a}} promising plot and impressive musical numbers, but became too [...] "cheesy" [...] and excessively sentimental. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal agreed that the season had definite highs and lows, but called the finale a [...] "warm embrace that – let’s face it – you just don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> go." ...|$|E
