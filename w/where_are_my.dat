500|$|The {{movement}} was evolving from radical, working-class roots into a campaign backed by society women and liberal professionals. Sanger {{and her fellow}} advocates began to tone down their radical rhetoric and instead emphasized the socioeconomic benefits of birth control, a policy which led to increasing acceptance by mainstream Americans. Media coverage increased, and several silent motion pictures produced in the 1910s featured birth control as a theme (including Birth Control, produced by Sanger and starring herself).Sanger's movie was banned as [...] "indecent" [...] in New York. Other movies included Miracle of Life, The Black Stork, The Unborn, <b>Where</b> <b>are</b> <b>my</b> Children and Hand That Rocks the Cradle.|$|E

2500|$|Among Weber's notable films are: the {{controversial}} Hypocrites, which featured the first full-frontal female nude scene in 1915; the 1916 film <b>Where</b> <b>Are</b> <b>My</b> Children?, which discussed abortion and birth control, and {{was added to}} the National Film Registry in 1993; her adaptation of Edgar Rice Burrough's Tarzan of the Apes novel for the first ever, Tarzan of the Apes film in 1918; and what is often considered her masterpiece, The Blot in 1921.|$|E
2500|$|After another {{significant}} censorship battle, and a vigorous publicity campaign by Universal, on May 13, 1917, Universal released The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, [...] "one {{of the most}} forceful films ever made in support of legalizing birth control", a follow-up to the previous year's top money-maker for Universal, <b>Where</b> <b>Are</b> <b>My</b> Children? Directed by Weber and Smalley based on their original script, it starred Smalley and Weber, in her last screen appearance, as a doctor's wife arrested and imprisoned for illegally disseminating family planning information. Influenced by the recent trial and imprisonment of pioneer birth control advocate Margaret Sanger, the film drew explicitly on her headline-generating activism.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>Where</b> <b>Are</b> <b>My</b> Children? (working title: The Illborn), {{which was}} {{released}} on April 16, 1916, Weber advocates social purity, birth control, and eugenics to prevent the [...] "deterioration of the race" [...] and the [...] "proliferation of the lower classes", and makes [...] "an indirect case for birth control or perhaps even for legalized, and safe, abortions". The film starred Tyrone Power, Sr. and his then-wife Helen Riaume; future star Mary MacLaren made her debut. It also makes use of several trick photography scenes, {{with an emphasis on}} multiple exposures to convey information or emotions visually. As a recurring motif, every time a character becomes pregnant, a child's face is double exposed over their shoulder.|$|E

2500|$|Hoping to [...] "become the {{editorial}} page of the studio", and to [...] "provoke a middle-class sense of responsibility for those less fortunate than themselves, and to stimulate moral reforms", Weber specialized in making films that stressed both high quality and moral rectitude, including films of the [...] "burning social and moral issues of the day", among them such controversial themes as abortion, eugenics, and birth control in <b>Where</b> <b>Are</b> <b>My</b> Children? (1916), influenced by the trial of Charles Stielow, an innocent man who was almost executed, opposition to capital punishment based on circumstantial evidence in [...] The People vs. John Doe; and alcoholism and opium addiction in Hop, the Devil's Brew, which were all successful at the box office, but, while embraced by reformers in the film industry, [...] "drew the ire of the conservatives". Despite the predominance of strong women in her films, in 1916 Weber disassociated herself from the women's suffrage movement.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} only weeks after Sanger's own film, Birth Control, was banned under a 1915 ruling of the United States Supreme Court that films [...] "did not constitute free speech", and the ruling of the New York Court of Appeals that a film on family planning may be censored [...] "in {{the interest of}} morality, decency, and public safety and welfare". Sensitive to the opinions of local communities, and hoping to avoid powerful censorship boards {{in the northeast and}} midwest, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle was distributed primarily in the southern and western regions of the United States, with the result that it did not attain the record-breaking attendance set by <b>Where</b> <b>Are</b> <b>My</b> Children? the previous year. When The Hand That Rocks the Cradle opened at Clune's Auditorium in Los Angeles in June 1917, Weber appeared on stage, bitterly denouncing attempts to alter or suppress her film. While The Hand That Rocks the Cradle is now lost, the surviving script and accompanying marketing materials make it clear that Weber mounted an unstinting argument in favor of [...] "voluntary motherhood".|$|E
2500|$|In March 1916, the National Board of Review {{expressed}} {{disapproval of}} the film for showings to mixed audiences, but later approved it for adult showings. It was banned in Pennsylvania {{on the grounds that}} it [...] "tended to debase or corrupt morals", but Universal won a case in Brooklyn, New York in 1916 to show the film after the district attorney filed suit against the theater manager and the Universal exchange president. Controversy, the threat of censorship, and the banning of <b>Where</b> <b>Are</b> <b>My</b> Children? in some locations helped fuel the box office success {{of the film}}, estimated to have grossed in excess of $3 million, in an era where ticket prices were less than 50c each, and [...] "rocketed Weber's name to larger audiences, bigger box-office returns, and an even higher annual income". The film spread Weber's fame internationally. For example, Kevin Brownlow indicates that this film attracted 30,000 in Preston, Lancashire, 40,000 in Bradford, Yorkshire, and 100,000 in two weeks in Sydney. In 2000, the Library of Congress Motion Picture Conservation Center copyrighted a preservation print reconstructed from several incomplete prints.|$|E
