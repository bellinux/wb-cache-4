500|$|In October 2016, in {{response}} to a fan's question about the lack of new Nine Inch Nails music, Reznor responded with [...] "2016 is not over yet". In December 2016, Reznor commented on his statement regarding Nine Inch Nails' return {{by the end of the}} year: [...] "Those words did come out of my mouth, didn't they? [...] Just <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happens." [...] Three days later, Reznor announced an extended play entitled Not the Actual Events, along with reissues of Broken, The Downward Spiral, and The Fragile, with subsequent reissues of With Teeth, Year Zero, and The Slip being released later in 2017. Also announced was The Fragile: Deviations 1, which comprised 37 instrumental, alternate and unreleased tracks, many of which have never been heard before anywhere. Not the Actual Events was released on December 23, 2016, with fans who pre-ordered it receiving their download links one day earlier. Atticus Ross was also revealed to be an official full-time member of the band, the first member other than Reznor to be added to the band.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the oral}} argument, the Chief Justice {{assigned}} Justice John Paul Stevens {{to write the}} majority opinion and Justice William J. Brennan, Jr. asked Justice Thurgood Marshall to write the minority or dissenting opinion, based on the initial count of the justices' views. [...] Since Justice Potter Stewart {{did not participate in}} the case, it would take a 5-3 vote to overturn the decision of the Circuit Court. [...] Stevens circulated a memorandum stating that his decision would be to invalidate the tax - Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justice William Rehnquist immediately stated they would join his opinion. [...] Justice Byron White stated that he would <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> the dissent said, and then indicated he would join the dissent in part. [...] It also appeared that Justice Harry Blackmun was also going to write a separate dissent, but he also stated that he would wait to see Marshall's opinion. [...] At this point, the tribe had the votes to win on a 4-4 vote, but the Court was close to being adjourned for the summer recess. [...] On July 3, 1981, the Court notified the parties to reargue the case on November 4, 1981.|$|E

500|$|Gilly later {{finds himself}} {{attracted}} to Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan); he initially fears he is {{moving on to}} soon. Whilst interviewed by Inside Soap Quinlan describes the scenes in which they share their first kiss stating: [...] "Gilly gets a new job at Look Sharpe as a personal trainer, and invites Lynsey for a free session, Lynsey's looking pretty good when she turns up, so Gilly gets a bit sweaty and hot under the collar - and she ends up hopping into the tub and dragging Gilly in fully clothed!" [...] They later meet up and feel awkward because of Gilly's grief for Steph, of this Quinlan adds: [...] "They're getting on well, {{but as soon as}} the word date is mentioned, it goes a bit wrong, nerves get the better of them and they have a huge row." [...] Off-screen Quinlan was not happy with the fact Gilly is trying to move on quick, of this he states: [...] "I thought it was a bit harsh, it feels like it's a little too soon, doesn't it? We'll just have to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> the future holds for Gilly and Lynsey - but there's no comparison to Steph..." ...|$|E
500|$|Ferdinand's actions {{constituted}} a definitive de facto break {{both with the}} autonomous governments, which had not yet declared formal independence, and with the effort of Spanish liberals to create a representative government that would fully include the overseas possessions. Such a government {{was seen as an}} alternative to independence by many in New Spain, Central America, the Caribbean, Quito, Peru, Upper Peru and Chile. Yet the news of the restoration of the [...] "ancien régime" [...] did not initiate a new wave of juntas, as had happened in 1809 and 1810, with the notable exception of the establishment of a junta in Cuzco demanding the implementation of the Spanish Constitution. Instead most Spanish Americans were moderates who decided to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> would come out of the restoration of normalcy. In fact, in areas of New Spain, Central America and Quito, governors found it expedient to leave the elected constitutional ayuntamientos in place for several years in order to prevent conflict with the local society. Liberals {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, nevertheless, continued to conspire to bring back a constitutional monarchy, ultimately succeeding in 1820. The most dramatic example of transatlantic collaboration is perhaps Francisco Javier Mina's expedition to Texas and northern Mexico in 1816 and 1817.|$|E
2500|$|... "Well, it's great", Washington coach Joe Gibbs {{said after}} the game, [...] "but {{to tell you the}} truth, I don't want either Dallas or Detroit. They'll both be tough. But we'll <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happens and take our chances." ...|$|E

The fight received the [...] "Fight of the Night" [...] award.|$|E
2500|$|His mother was, in many ways, {{instrumental}} {{in his ability}} to pursue art as a vocation. When he was 11 years of age, she had noted in her diary: [...] "The child's character is still so unformed that I cannot say what I think of it. He behaves like a spoiled child, but he does not lack intelligence. We shall have to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> is inside this chrysalis. Perhaps an artist?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Cypress Hill {{commenced}} its Rise Up tour in Philadelphia on April 10, 2010. Julio G {{had replaced}} DJ Muggs for the tour. Muggs had been absent due to working on several other projects, including separate albums with B-Real and Sen Dog. [...] The group {{was supposed to}} stop in Tucson, Arizona but canceled the show in protest of the recent immigration legislation. At the Rock en Seine festival in Paris on August 27, 2010 they {{said in an interview}} that they would <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happens with the legislation before going back there. Cypress Hill performed at the Reading and Leeds Festivals in 2010, on August 28 at Leeds and August 29 at Reading.|$|E
2500|$|On July 31, {{just hours}} {{prior to the}} {{announcement}} of Castro's condition, U.S. President George W.

No one knows when Fidel Castro will move on. In my judgment, that's the work of the Almighty." [...] On August 2, Senator Robert Bennett (R-Utah) said President Bush told him the administration was surprised by the announcement of Castro's illness, [...] "The president's comment was that everybody was caught by surprise, and we'll have to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> U.S. action is necessary.

6000|$|... "That's to my taste, too," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "but {{it will be}} better for us to <b>wait</b> here <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> Maka has to say when he gets back.

He flew off in a passion, and talked such {{nonsense}} about marriage settlements, and forbidding the banns, and so on.

2500|$|Irvine {{remained}} at Jaguar for 2002 and was again partnered by de la Rosa. In {{preparation for the}} upcoming season, Irvine undertook a fitness examination and recorded a high score. However, he was cautious about his team's prospects going into the year, saying: [...] "We've just got to <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happens with this car, that's the question mark". At the opening round in Australia, Irvine finished fourth; and in the following race in Malaysia, {{he was forced to}} retire with an hydraulics problem. Irvine later managed to clinch seventh place in the Brazilian Grand Prix, before he suffered consecutive retirements in the next three races. He later finished the Monaco Grand Prix in ninth position, which was followed up with further consecutive retirements in the seven races. However, this marked a turning point as Irvine managed to finish in all of the remaining races. He was in the points scoring positions twice in this period—a sixth-place finish in Belgium and took his final career podium with third in Italy. He finished the season ninth in the Drivers' Championship, with eight points.|$|E
2500|$|The Marshall Mathers LP was {{recorded}} in a two-month-long [...] "creative binge", which often involved 20-hour-long studio sessions. Eminem hoped to keep publicity down during the recording {{in order to stay}} focused on working and figuring out how to [...] "map out" [...] each song. He described himself as a [...] "studio rat" [...] who benefited creatively from the isolated environment of the studio. Much of the album was written spontaneously in the studio; Dr. Dre noted, [...] "We don't wake up at two in the morning, call each other, and say, 'I have an idea. We gotta get to the studio. ' We just <b>wait</b> <b>and</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happens when we get there. [...] " [...] Eminem observed that much of his favorite material on the album evolved from [...] "fucking around" [...] in the studio; [...] "Marshall Mathers" [...] developed from the rapper watching Jeff Bass casually strumming a guitar, while [...] "Criminal" [...] was based on a piano riff Eminem overheard Bass playing in studio next door. [...] "Kill You" [...] was written when Eminem heard the track playing in the background while talking to Dr. Dre on the phone and developed an interest in using it for a song. He then wrote the lyrics at home and met up with Dr. Dre and the two recorded the song together.|$|E
