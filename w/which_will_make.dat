5|$|During the game, Quickdraw must {{locate the}} wanted outlaws one by one. Once an outlaw {{has been found}} and shot (shooting the outlaw does not kill him, but only initiates a duel), the game shifts to the first-person {{targeting}} minigame. This time, the player must shoot the rapidly moving outlaw as quickly as possible. The player can either wait for the outlaw to draw, or take the initiative and shoot first, <b>which</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> the bandit draw his weapon as well. If the player successfully shoots an outlaw, a bounty is paid (increasing with every round), and a new outlaw enters the town.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the large}} effort {{that was made}} in 2004 to improve the {{motorway}} features of the Thessaloniki ring road, the motorway is still insufficient to tackle Thessaloniki's increasing traffic and metropolitan population. To tackle this problem, the government has introduced large scale redevelopment plans throughout 2011 with tenders expected to be announced within early 2012; that include the total restructuring of the A16 in {{the western side of}} the city, with new junctions and new emergency lanes throughout the whole length of the motorway. In the eastern side an even larger scale project has been announced, {{for the construction of a}} new elevated motorway section above the existing, which would allow faster travel for drivers heading through to the airport and Chalkidiki that do not wish to exit into the city, and will decongest the existing motorway for city commuters. The plans also include adding one more lane in each direction on the existing A16 ring road and on the A25 passing through Thessaloniki's southeast suburbs, from its junction with the A16 in Kalamaria, up to the airport exit (ΕΟ67); <b>which</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> it an 8 lane highway.|$|E

40|$|In {{sequential}} bargaining models without outside options, each player's {{bargaining power}} is ultimately determined by <b>which</b> player <b>will</b> <b>make</b> an offer and when. This paper analyzes a sequential bargaining {{model in which}} players may hold different beliefs about <b>which</b> player <b>will</b> <b>make</b> an offer and when. Excessive optimism about making offers in the future can cause delays in agreement. The main result states that, despite this, if players will remain sufficiently optimistic for a sufficiently long future, then in equilibrium they will agree immediately. This result is also extended to other canonical models of optimism. Copyright Econometric Society, 2002. ...|$|R

25|$|At the Cowles Commission, Simon’s {{main goal}} was to link {{economic}} theory to mathematics and statistics. His main contributions were to the fields of general equilibrium and econometrics. He was greatly influenced by the marginalist debate {{that began in the}} 1930s. The popular work of the time argued that it was not apparent empirically that entrepreneurs needed to follow the marginalist principles of profit-maximization/cost-minimization in running organizations. The argument went on to note that profit-maximization was not accomplished, in part, {{because of the lack of}} complete information. In decision-making, Simon believed that agents face uncertainty about the future and costs in acquiring information in the present. These factors limit the extent to which agents may make a fully rational decision, thus they possess only “bounded rationality” and must make decisions by “satisficing,” or choosing that which might not be optimal, but <b>which</b> <b>will</b> <b>make</b> them happy enough. Bounded rationality is a central theme in behavioral economics. It is concerned with the ways in which the actual decision making process influences decision. Theories of bounded rationality relax one or more assumptions of standard expected utility theory.|$|E
