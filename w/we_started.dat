5|$|During the Depression I joined Mrs Mac's {{electrical}} {{school in}} Phillip Street. It {{was the first}} time girls were involved with electrical circuits, Morse and making radio sets. Later Mrs Mac {{decided it was time to}} use our skills in industry, so she persuaded Airzone Ltd to take one of us (me) on trial in their radio section. Soon the others followed from the school, and <b>we</b> <b>started</b> the component parts section, and we were absorbed into many other sections.|$|E
5|$|Geri {{came in and}} sang: 'Too much of something/Da-da-da-da-da...Right. OK. You got that?' <b>We</b> <b>started</b> {{working on}} it {{and we wanted to}} do some sort of doo-wop vocal thing. So we {{constructed}} this backing track and then more of the girls started to come in—this was quite a good day—and gradually they started to add on their little bits.|$|E

2500|$|A Baraita {{reported}} that Rabbi taught that in conferring an honor, <b>we</b> <b>start</b> {{with the most}} important person, while in conferring a curse, <b>we</b> <b>start</b> with the least important. [...] demonstrates that in conferring an honor, <b>we</b> <b>start</b> with the most important person, for when Moses instructed Aaron, Eleazar, and Ithamar {{that they should not}} conduct themselves as mourners, Moses spoke first to Aaron and only thereafter to Aaron's sons Eleazar and Ithamar. And [...] demonstrates that in conferring a curse, <b>we</b> <b>start</b> with the least important, for God cursed the serpent first, and only thereafter cursed Eve and then Adam.|$|R

5|$|It's {{strange to}} hear Uncle Tupelo {{mentioned}} {{because what we}} were doing was in such a long line of musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying <b>we</b> <b>started</b> anything because we were just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to a long line of fairly good music. That's the way we looked at it at the time—doing what was right for the song.|$|E
5|$|My dearest mother, This morning, {{about four}} o'clock, I was got up, just one hour after I retired, with the {{information}} that at six {{we were going to}} Richmond. At six <b>we</b> <b>started.</b> The rebs had gone at three, along a road strewn with all the munitions of war. Richmond was reached, but the barbarous South had consigned it to flames. The roar of the bursting shells was terrific.|$|E
5|$|There {{was this}} {{absolute}} scorching deal on cases of PBR and kegs. We {{were one of}} the few outlets in Portland that sold kegs to go, so we could sell them at a really good deal. So <b>we</b> <b>started</b> the PBR dollar-can special. I'd say it was around 1997 or 1998. At one point, I know they said we were the largest distributor of Pabst in the state, if not the country. We got written up in The New York Times about it. We were going through hundreds of cases and dozens of kegs a week.|$|E

5|$|I was {{as student}} in the sixties, engaged {{in the civil rights}} movement, anti-Vietnam War protests. I'd come from New York to attend the University of Wisconsin. It was an {{exciting}} time. A lot of active students wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole health program, but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately <b>we</b> <b>started</b> our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E
5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from the moment you left Paris, or Senlis where <b>we</b> <b>started</b> in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. That happened to me. And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and bring you down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E
5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, {{appearing}} to be dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, <b>we</b> <b>started</b> the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, thinking that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see {{the other members of the}} band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.|$|E

25|$|But if in {{addition}} to interchanging {{the names of the}} values we also interchange the names of the two binary operations, now there is no trace of what we have done. The end product is completely indistinguishable from what <b>we</b> <b>started</b> with. We might notice that the columns for x∧y and x∨y in the truth tables had changed places, but that switch is immaterial.|$|E
25|$|I {{think we}} were all pretty naive about what we, what we were achieving—we were having too much fun to get kind of caught up. We'd just {{released}} our second album overseas on an independent label; and, spent time in America as an independent act. And that was around about the time where <b>we</b> <b>started</b> our own label, just to, um, release, maybe, release a few, some bands of friends of ours, in bands.|$|E

25|$|Since <b>we</b> <b>started</b> from an {{arbitrary}} partition {{and ended up}} {{as close as we}} wanted to either zero or one, it is false to say that we are eventually trapped near some number , so this function is not Riemann integrable. However, it is Lebesgue integrable. In the Lebesgue sense its integral is zero, since the function is zero almost everywhere. But this is a fact that is {{beyond the reach of the}} Riemann integral.|$|E
25|$|From {{the camp}} on the river Amu-Daria - where I was sent from the North - I was {{evacuated}} finally with other Poles to {{the banks of the}} Caspian Sea from where we went to Pahlevi on the Persian coast. There the Polish ex-prisoners gradually received English uniforms, our old rags infected with all sorts of disease and insects being burned, and <b>we</b> <b>started</b> the journey towards Teheran and from there to Palestine.|$|E
25|$|We have a {{song called}} Charlie Brown, which was the centrepiece of this other record <b>we</b> <b>started</b> first. We were playing the riff on an {{accordion}} and Guy came in one morning and said, 'I'm afraid I have to put my foot down. I don't want to speak out of turn, but I will not allow this song to be played on an accordion - that has {{to go in with}} the Mylo bunch'. So then we thought — let's just make one album.|$|E
