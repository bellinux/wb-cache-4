5|$|In the Mahabharata retelling, when Sugriva re-challenges Vali, Tara dissuades Vali {{from going}} to the fight and points out that Sugriva may have found a protector. Tara, {{described}} as lustrous like the moon, is praised by Vali as one <b>who</b> <b>understands</b> the language of all creatures and is astute to clarify her statement. Tara warns him about Sugriva's alliance with Rama and the plotting of Vali's death {{at the hands of}} Sugriva and his advisers. Vali not only disregards Tara's advice, but also suspects Tara of cheating on him with Sugriva. Vali leaves, speaking harshly to Tara.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Aquinas, while proposing five proofs of God's {{existence}} in his Summa Theologica, objected to Anselm's argument. He suggested that people cannot know {{the nature of}} God and, therefore, cannot conceive of God in the way Anselm proposed. The ontological argument would be meaningful only to someone <b>who</b> <b>understands</b> the essence of God completely. Aquinas reasoned that, as only God can completely know His essence, only He could use the argument. His rejection of the ontological argument caused other Catholic theologians to also reject the argument.|$|E
5|$|When finally {{faced with}} the loss of speech, the {{characters}} readily express what they feel. Buffy and Riley, after a series of eyebrow movements and simply mouthed questions, are able to kiss spontaneously. Xander's actions are very clearly directed toward protecting Anya and punishing Spike for harming her, and likewise, within a matter of moments Anya's doubts about how Xander feels about her have disappeared and she becomes instantly affectionate towards him again. Tara, who was overcome with shyness while speaking during the Wicca meeting, easily expresses courage when touching Willow, and Willow realizes she has finally found someone <b>who</b> <b>understands</b> and shares what she is seeking.|$|E

5|$|Williams {{returned}} with The Hawk Is Dying (2007), also starring Michael Pitt. It {{tells the story}} of George (played by Paul Giamatti), trying to find meaning in his life by training a wild red-tailed hawk. Williams portrayed Pitt's girlfriend, the only person <b>who</b> <b>understands</b> George's growing obsession. The film earned $7,000 domestically playing at one theater. Five months after giving birth, Williams was back, appearing in The Hottest State, a film by Ethan Hawke, adapted from his 1996 book. Critics panned it for being too pretentious and self-aware. Variety writer Leslie Felperin believed the film underused Williams as a former lover of one of the main characters. It did a limited theatrical run beginning August 24, ultimately grossing $137,340. Williams played Edie Sedgwick, muse of Andy Warhol, {{as a part of the}} biographical ensemble piece I'm Not There, inspired by the musician Bob Dylan.|$|E
5|$|Also {{noting the}} unachievable {{ambition}} {{of solving the}} conflict between naturalism and religion, Martin A Greenman, remarks that one must come to the book “with a certain mood”. Too critical a mood would blind the reader to its religious insights, while the sensitivity and depth of its philosophic insights would be lost {{if one were to}} approach it in a too enthusiastically religious mood. Greenman finishes by justifying Stace’s philosophy to logical positivists by quoting from Wittgenstein's Tractatus: “My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he <b>who</b> <b>understands</b> me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them….He must surmount these propositions: then he sees the world rightly” (6. 54.) Dorothy M. Emmet found issue with the notion that the mystical experience is the point of intersection between the temporal and eternal orders. She writes that there are difficulties in Stace defining these orders as two distinct “orders of being”, rather than just as a way of speaking, because this then means some statements about the temporal order are relevant to what is said about the eternal order and vice versa. Indeed, the interrelation between these two orders is difficult to maintain. She also questioned Stace’s characterisation of mystical consciousness as being the same everywhere.|$|E

His ardent disciples Devavimal Gani composed Hira Saubhagya Kavya and another disciple Padmasagara composed Jagatguru Kavya in his honour. Both works of poetry written in Sanskrit were composed in 1590 C.E. and give an authenticate account of relationship of Suri with Akbar.

500|$|More {{important}} than productivity is systematicity since {{it does not}} rely on questionable idealizations about human cognition. The argument states that a cognizer is able to understand some sentence in virtue of understanding another. For example, no one <b>who</b> <b>understands</b> [...] "John loves Mary" [...] is unable to understand [...] "Mary loves John", and no one <b>who</b> <b>understands</b> [...] "P and Q" [...] is unable to understand [...] "P". Systematicity itself is rarely challenged as a property of natural languages and logics, but some challenge that thought is systematic {{in the same way}} languages are. Still others from the connectionist tradition have tried to build non-classical networks that can account for the apparent systematicity of language.|$|E
