25|$|There {{is also a}} lack of {{regional}} uniform customs and other border controls that comply with international best practices, which makes documentation delays much more likely. Cargo documentation is often complicated with separate <b>weigh</b> <b>bills</b> for each country traversed; any documentation problem can result in the wagon being detained for several days.|$|R
5000|$|On June 6, 1948, Senator Alexander Wiley, {{chair of}} the Senate Judiciary Committee, {{announced}} that his committee continued to <b>weigh</b> the Mundt-Nixon <b>Bill</b> with [...] "a fair and open mind." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1928, sizing of {{the bills}} was {{standardized}} (involving a 25% reduction in their current sizes, compared to the older, larger notes nicknamed [...] "horse blankets"). Modern U.S. currency, regardless of denomination, is 2.61inches (66.3mm) wide, 6.14inches (156mm) long, and 0.0043inches (0.109mm) thick. A single <b>bill</b> <b>weighs</b> about fifteen and a half grains (one gram) and costs approximately 4.2 cents for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to produce.|$|R

50|$|Three {{other races}} on the Aintree card were {{broadcast}} on the programme before Lynam {{handed over to}} Richard Pitman and Peter Scudamore who presented the build-up to the big race itself, which included live scenes from inside the jockeys' <b>weighing</b> room. <b>Bill</b> Smith also interviewed many of the connections of the runners in the saddling boxes and paddock before the race, while betting shows were read by Graham Rock. Julian Wilson was at the start in case any incidents similar to the false start {{of the previous year}} occurred. Once the runners were on the course and had paraded, the commentary was handed over to Jim McGrath, John Hanmer and lead commentator Peter O'Sullevan who was commentating a National for the BBC for the 49th time and had called home the winners of all the televised Nationals.|$|R

She was traveling on a showboat-museum in the Midwest however when Barnum learned of her. He hired her in 1862. Her name was shortened to Lavinia Warren. She first appeared at the Museum in 1863. Warren was 21 years old, [...] tall, and <b>weighed</b> [...] Barnum <b>billed</b> her as [...] "The Queen of Beauty".

25|$|The American $100 {{bill has}} some competition, {{primarily}} from the €500 note. The larger value of the banknote {{makes it easier to}} transport larger amounts of money. As an example, $1 million in currency in $100 <b>bills</b> <b>weighs</b> 22 pounds, if, say, you were to carry it on board an airplane. It is difficult to carry this much money without a briefcase and some physical security. The same amount in €500 notes would weigh less than three pounds, and it could probably be dispersed in clothing and in luggage without attracting attention or alerting a security device. For many illegal operations, the problem of transporting currency is more difficult than transporting cocaine because of the size and weight of the currency. The ease of transporting banknotes makes the euro very attractive to Latin American drug cartels.|$|R
500|$|The two melampittas are pitta-like {{birds that}} have entirely black plumage and strong long legs and large strong feet. The wings are short and rounded, {{and the primary}} {{feathers}} are uniquely recurved and emarginated. The feathers of the forecrown are erectile. The lesser melampitta is around [...] long and weighs around [...] , whereas the greater melampitta is larger and considerably heavier at around [...] in length and <b>weighs</b> [...] The <b>bill</b> of the greater melampitta is also larger {{than that of the}} lesser melampitta, which is hooked. [...] There is some variation in the family in the tails. The greater melampitta has specially strengthened remiges and retriges, which are often worn, a possible adaptation to its habit of roosting in limestone sinkholes. Those sinkholes are too deep and narrow to fly directly out and the tail may be used to help cling {{to the side of the}} hole as it exits, in the fashion of a woodpecker. The tail of that species is long, whereas the tail of the lesser melampitta is short; in both species end of the tail is rounded. Both species move around on the ground by hopping.|$|R
