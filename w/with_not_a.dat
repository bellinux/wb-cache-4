The fourth reviewer, Hope Chapman, expressed immediate dislike towards the series, criticizing it for lacking anything to engage the viewers and for being a lazy adaptation of a light novel, and concluding the review with [...] "I can't even remember the last time I saw something <b>with</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> single redeeming factor or thing to recommend about it at all." [...] Silverman reviewed the series future episodes. Plotwise, she praised the Enrollment Arcs underline on standardized testing, criticized the Nine Schools Competition Arc for its execution and weak exposition, and felt the characters were uninteresting.

500|$|A Very Merry Unauthorized Children's Scientology Pageant {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} the press.

[...] A 2003 review in New York City's The Village Voice compared the show to The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui, stating: [...] "Just as Ui doesn't explain the complex phenomenon of the Third Reich, Scientology Pageant doesn't probe the psychology of cults; instead, both demystify subjects whose appeal stems {{in no small part}} from the mystique their acolytes have attributed to them." [...] Though most of the media reception of the musical was positive, New York Church of Scientology President John Carmichael did not have kind words for the production. [...] Carmichael asserted that L. Ron Hubbard was portrayed in the play as [...] "an authoritarian demagogue whose methods create emotionless followers." [...] Other critics complained that the young members of the cast were portraying characters and depicting content that they could not understand.|$|E

The song was described by Q magazine as, [...] "The most toxic of strummed kiss-offs, <b>with</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> snowball's chance in hell of reconciliation." [...] Dylan, later describing the song, said that [...] "I had carried that song around in my head {{for a long time}} and I remember that when I was writing it, I'd remembered a Gene Vincent song.

[...] Lyons also complimented a number of changes in the series the episode seemed to indicate, including shifting allegiances, goodwill where there used to be bad and a possible budding romance between Andy and Kelly. Alan Sepinwall, television journalist with The Star-Ledger, said the episode, [...] "started off seeming like a dumb and pointless idea before gradually revealing itself to be a fun, and even welcome, diversion." [...] Sepinwall said the episode was not as funny as other recent ones, but that he enjoyed seeing the characters interact this way together, and particularly liked seeing Dwight and Phyllis bond, [...] "even as he treated her like a racehorse". Josh McAuliffe of The Times-Tribune in Scranton, Pennsylvania, described the episode as [...] "a wacky and wonderful little gem, one of those rare ones where it was just wall-to-wall happy, giddy fun, <b>with</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> drop of pathos, except for maybe Michael whining about having to eat lunch by himself."

[...] Canning opined that Liz's admissions to Oprah Winfrey were [...] "painfully funny", and that Tracy [...] "was on fire" [...] following his actions in this episode. In conclusion, Canning gave it a 10 out of 10 rating.

TV Guides Matt Mitovich commented that the episode was [...] "Rock-solid", while Neal Justin of the Star Tribune believed it was [...] "the most brilliant episode in the series' history".

The Princess Leia voice, her drunken panic on the plane and the religious fervor at the knowledge that Oprah would be coming to the studio were all hilarious, and played with the sort of confidence I don't know that she would have had {{at the start of the}} series." ...|$|E
500|$|The series 10 episode [...] "Love Will Tear Us Apart", {{which saw}} Maddy stood up by Dan on a return visit from France, was {{selected}} as a televisual pick of the day by The Guardian, the Daily Mirror, and the Birmingham Mail. The Guardian critic Gareth McLean was critical of the episode, writing: [...] "Now here's an idea for another Holby spin-off - one set in the hospital's STD clinic. Of course, given the ceaseless intra-departmental shagging {{that goes on in}} that hospital, there might be too much crossover with existing shows, <b>with</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> look-in for characters who aren't actually on staff. Here, sexist surgeon Clifford returns to complicate Maddy's life, though since she's been sleeping with Sam, who's slept with Connie, Chrissie and Faye, she appears to need no help in that area.She's going to die." [...] The Sun journalist Anita Baig has also commented critically on the character, noting {{that when it comes to}} medicine, Maddy [...] "always seems to be having difficulties." [...] Daily Mirror [...] critic Jim Shelley has discussed the outlandish nature of the character's storylines, dubbing the line [...] "I don't know why people complain about the NHS" [...] from a 2007 episode his 'Naive statement of the week', explaining: [...] "Hmmmm let's see. Abra covering up that he was operating on his arms-dealer father. Maddy hiding the fact she killed her junkie sister's daughter. And secret cokehead Jesus Of Nazareth (Robert Powell) keeping quiet about counselling Elliot's son for heroin addiction. Oh yeah, and in Casualty, in Holby's A department, nurse Ruth Winters secretly fixed her dad's breathalyser test. Anyone detect a theme emerging?"

2500|$|In November 2008, Yulia Latynina, Russian journalist, {{asserted}} that the war started on 7 August, when the Russian forces which were massed on the Georgian border, crossed the Roki tunnel and entered Georgia. She wrote her own analysis of pre-war events for EJ. She quoted in her work Temur Iakobashvili, Georgian minister, as saying that when Saakashvili was informed of the shelling of the Georgian village of Tamarasheni, he ordered no retaliation; however, the information Saakashvili received next, changed everything: that was of 150 Russian tanks moving towards the Roki tunnel. According to Latynina, if Saakashvilil had known that by then Russian 135th and 693rd regiments were already in Java, his reaction would be different. Latynina argues that Saakashvili was faced <b>with</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> strategic, but tactical dilemma: selecting not when to clash with the Russians but where - at night in Tskhinvali or at dawn in Gori (well inside Georgia). Latynina stated that Tamarasheni was shelled in order to liberate the road for the Russian tanks, because they couldn't move towards Gori through Tskhinvali via the Zar road. Latynina concluded that Georgia didn't need small-scale clashes with the separatists, because if the Georgians had had military plans for reintegration of South Ossetia, then they would have needed secrecy. But South Ossetia was in need to shell the enemy, like Hamas or Hezbollah do. The corrupt ruling regime of South Ossetia needed the war. Latynina noted that while Kokoity and Russia had been preparing to defend from the Georgian attack for 4 years, there was no bomb shelter in the headquarters of Russian peacekeepers. Latynina finally concluded {{that by the time}} when Russia formally declared that it had entered the war against Georgia, the Russian 58th army (not the peacekeepers), had already been engaged in military clashes: [...] "It is obvious that [...] at 3 pm Russia decided not to start the war but to acknowledge it." ...|$|E
