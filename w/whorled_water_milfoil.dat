50|$|To {{the untrained}} eye, <b>whorled</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> can look {{similar to other}} species.|$|E
5000|$|Most <b>whorled</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> {{occurs in}} semi-shallow ponds, lakes, marshes, ditches and slow running streams of lowland districts [...] Milfoil thrives {{in areas with}} a light sandy bottom and medium loamy soils. Overall, the plant grows best in still waters with {{alkaline}} soils. <b>Whorled</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> is sometimes found with or near other aquatic plants, such as some types of pondweed (Potamogeton strictifolius) and (Potamogeton ogdenii), water star-grass (Heteranthera dubia) and water-marigold (Megalodonta beckii).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Whorled</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> {{is a good}} water {{oxygenator}} {{in small}} quantities such as fish and frog ponds. It is also ideal in providing protection and respiration for fish spawn [...] Management techniques of <b>whorled</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> are not exactly known, but natural competition with other invasive aquatic plants has been the main control so far. [...] There are a few management practices that some places are using, {{but they have not}} been approved for long-term usage.|$|E
50|$|Exotic species infestations are a concern, with an {{existing}} Eurasian <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> population, {{which is being}} addressed.|$|R

50|$|The various pits support varied aquatic and marinal flora {{including}} the nationally scarce <b>whorled</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil.</b> Other species include the fan- leaved water crowfoot, flowering rush, lesser reedmace, frogbit, blunt-leaved pondweed, lesser pondweed and the brown sedge.|$|E
50|$|The {{best way}} to {{identify}} <b>whorled</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> (M. verticillatum) is by looking at its {{two different types of}} leaves. The first type is the submersed leave, which looks feathery and contain about 5 to 14 leaflet pairs per leaf. The whorls along the stem contain about 4 to 5 leaves, which are spaced about 1 cm apart. The other type is known as the emergent leaves. These leaves occur on the emergent spike and are pinnately lobed. From June till September <b>whorled</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> produces flowers and fruits above or at the water's surface on erect spikes along the emergent leaves. The emergent leaves are typically two or more times longer than the flowers and fruits. Another way to distinguish <b>whorled</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> is to look for turions, winter buds that appear toward the end of its growing season. This milfoil is one of a few that produce turions. This characteristic can also rule out other types of water milfoil that lack turions such as Eurasian water milfoil, parrot feather, hybrid water milfoil, and low water milfoil. The turions of this milfoil look like long yellowish-green club-shaped buds with small stiff leaves attached to the submerged stem. In the spring after dormancy the small, thick, dark green turions expand and grow from the stem. As the plant develops roots and continues to grow, the larger green summer leaves are produced {{at the tip of the}} plant. Turion leaves can be seen at the base of the plant sometimes into July. In fall the turions, with some other plant material, often break away from the majority of the rooted plant and float to new areas. Those fragments can be found washing up along shorelines in late fall. The stems of the <b>whorled</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> form into mats from branched and unbranched stems that grow to be 20 to 100 inches long.|$|E
50|$|The dykes which {{intersect}} the marshland are habitats {{for water}} soldier (Stratoides aloides), <b>whorled</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> (Myriophyllum verticillatum), water violet (Hottonia palustris) and floating pondweed (Potamogeton natans). They also support waterfowl such as garganey and shoveller. The marshlands themselves support birds such as redshank, lapwing, oystercatcher and snipe. In recent years, the Norfolk hawker dragonfly (Aeshna isosceles) has been attracted {{back to this}} area through specific management of the dykes.|$|E
50|$|Myriophyllum variifolium is {{a species}} of <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> native to eastern Australia where it grows in aquatic habitat such as ponds and streams.|$|R
5000|$|Euhrychiopsis lecontei {{is a type}} of weevil {{that has}} been {{investigated}} as a potential biocontrol agent for Eurasian <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> [...] It is found in the eastern and central United States and western Canada [...]|$|R
50|$|Myriophyllum simulans is {{a species}} of <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> native to southeastern Australia where it grows in aquatic habitat such as ponds and streams, as well as muddy or swampy soil. Highly variable, it closely resembles M. variifolium.|$|R
5000|$|Myriophyllum verticillatum, the whorl-leaf watermilfoil or whorled water-milfoil, is {{a native}} {{to much of the}} North America, North Africa, and Eurasia. It closely resembles another native milfoil, called {{northern}} water milfoil (M. sibiricum) [...] <b>Whorled</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> is also easily confused with four types of invasive milfoils: Eurasian water milfoil (M. spicatum), Variable water-milfoil (M. heterophyllum), Parrot feather (M. aquaticum), and hybrid water milfoil (M. heterophyllum X M. laxum).|$|E
5000|$|Freshwater ditch communities, which lie mainly {{along the}} western side of the SSSI area, are {{recognised}} as being of [...] "being of international importance" [...] and support species such as broad-leaved pondweed Potamogeton natans, water violet Hottonia palustris and the nationally scarce <b>whorled</b> <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> Myriophyllum verticillatum. Other areas of ditches support species such as the nationally scarce water soldier Stratiotes alludes, fen pondweed Potamogeton coloratus, hairlike pondweed Potamogeton trichoides and water parsnip Sium latifolium. The area of ditch close to Breydon Water are more brackish in nature and feature species such as soft hornwort Ceratophyllum submersum and the nationally scarce stiff saltmarsh grass Puccinellia rupestris.|$|E
5000|$|The {{unimproved}} wet-meadow communities largely {{consist of}} variants of the nationally rare Blunt-flowered Rush-Marsh Thistle (Juncus subnodulosus-Cirsium palustre), Soft/Sharp Flowered Rush-Marsh Bedstraw (Juncus effusus/acutiflorus-Galium palustre), Purple Moorgrass-Meadow Thistle (Molinia caerulea-Cirsium dissectum) and Crested Dog’s-tail-Common Knapweed [...] )Cynosurus cristatus-Centaurea nigra) community types In total over 130 species of flowering plant {{have been recorded}} including 3 species of orchids, 21 grasses and 14 sedges. The extensive system of rhynes and field ditches contains a rich flora which includes three nationally scarce species: Water Parsnip (Sium latafolium), <b>Whorled</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Milfoil</b> (Myriophyllum verticillatum) and Fen Pondweed (Potamogeton coloratus). The site is now connected to the Severn Estuary by the Portbury Ashlands nature reserve.|$|E
50|$|This {{damselfly}} breeds in ponds, {{lakes and}} ditches and, in continental Europe, sluggish rivers. It {{seems to be}} well able to tolerate brackish water. It seems {{to be associated with}} floating vegetation such as Hornwort and <b>Water</b> <b>Milfoil</b> (Myriophyllum).|$|R
5000|$|With the {{increase}} in water sports, the spread of many <b>water</b> <b>milfoils</b> (Haloragaceae) has increased over the years. The spread of a milfoil is not only within one area, sometimes it spreads from one area to another many miles away.|$|R
25|$|Lake Minnetonka's {{environmental}} issues became a concern after curly-leaf pondweed {{was discovered in}} its waters in 1900. Purple loosestrife was discovered in the lake in 1940, as was Eurasian <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> in 1987. Zebra mussels were discovered in the lake in 2010.|$|R
50|$|In 2005, infestations of Eurasian <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> were discovered. During the summer, over {{a quarter}} of the lake's surface area became {{inhabited}} by the milfoil. Treatments for the invasive began in 2006. In 2007 the infestation was brought down to acceptable levels.|$|R

5000|$|Myriophyllum indicum is {{a species}} of <b>water</b> <b>milfoil.</b> It is native to India, where it grows in aquatic habitat such as ponds and streams. It {{generally}} grows over a meter long, with its stem lined with whorls of fleshy green leaves divided into many narrow lobes.|$|R
50|$|The {{dominant}} plant of {{the waters}} edge is reed canary grass running from the East round to the South and into the West side. Creeping bent, reed sweet grass and iris are abundant. Common water-crowfoot, chara species, Canadian waterweed, slender spike-rush, perfoliate pondweed and spiked <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> are the other main species present.|$|R
50|$|The pond lies in {{the centre}} of Thijsse's Hof, and plays an {{important}} role, {{from the point of}} view of garden architecture, as well as {{from the point of view}} of the ecological value. It attracts many bird species and insects, like dragonflies. In the water several plants are growing, like spiked <b>water</b> <b>milfoil,</b> mare's tail and fringed water lily.|$|R
50|$|Invasive {{species of}} {{particular}} threat to Lake Whatcom include zebra mussel, New Zealand mud snail, Asian carp, and viral hemorrhagic septicemia (VHS). Currently, {{none of the}} fifteen species identified by the State of Washington as “most unwanted” {{are found in the}} lake. Eurasian <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> is the only species on Washington’s list of 50 unwanted species (13 of which are freshwater) that is known to exist in Lake Whatcom.|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} lakes, Memphremagog is accumulating phosphorus, sediments, and other pollutants, {{primarily}} runoff from farms, but {{from other sources}} as well. Exotic species infestations are a concern, with an existing Eurasian <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> population {{and the potential for}} a zebra mussel infestation. Since the 1970s, significant efforts have been made to reduce the polluting effects of direct discharges into the lake and its tributaries, and lake quality has improved.|$|R
60|$|Every still {{spot in a}} chalk stream {{becomes so}} choked with weed as to require moving at least thrice a year, to supply the mills with <b>water.</b> Grass, <b>milfoil,</b> <b>water</b> crowfoot, hornwort, starwort, horsetail, {{and a dozen other}} {{delicate}} plants, form one tangled forest, denser than those of the Amazon, and more densely peopled likewise.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of the most recent survey in 2005, Monson Lake was found to have good water clarity and low to {{moderate}} nutrient pollution. What pollution there was came largely from agricultural runoff. Aquatic and emergent plants exhibited good density and biodiversity. [...] Monson Lake does experience cyanobacteria blooms in summer, but is free of Eurasian <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> and other invasive aquatic plants. The water quality in West Sunburg Lake is considered very high.|$|R
50|$|The lake {{suffers from}} {{eutrophication}} due to excess nutrients blamed on runoff from development and septic {{systems in the}} immediate area. Invasive species are also impacting the lake’s eco-system. These include the Eurasian <b>Water</b> <b>Milfoil.</b> Attractive, but invasive, are water lilies, plentiful at {{the southwest corner of}} the lake and though the passage to the outlet and dam. Strategies to counter these problems include boat inspections for the mussels, periodic partial drainage and lake weed removal.|$|R
50|$|Aquatic moncots and dicots both {{occur in}} Australian waters. Australia has about 51,000 square {{kilometres}} of seagrass meadows {{and the most}} diverse group seagrass species in the world. There are 22 species found in temperate waters and 15 in tropical waters out of a known 70 species worldwide. Aquatic dicots include the mangroves; in Australia there are 39 mangrove species that cover 11,500 square kilometres and comprise the third largest area of mangroves in the world. Other native aquatic dicots here include water lilies and <b>water</b> <b>milfoils.</b>|$|R
50|$|Myriophyllum sibiricum is {{a species}} of <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> known by the common names shortspike watermilfoil, {{northern}} watermilfoil, and Siberian water-milfoil. It is native to Russia, China, and much of North America, where it grows in aquatic habitat such as ponds and streams. It generally grows over a meter long, its green stem drying white. It is lined with whorls of fanlike green leaves divided into many narrow, feathery lobes. The erect inflorescence is a spike of small flowers up to 8 cm long which grows above the water's surface.|$|R
25|$|The River Hull valley {{dominates the}} western {{landscape}} of Holderness. The river {{and its associated}} wetland habitats support a diverse range of plants and animals. The upper tributaries of the river originate {{on the edge of}} the Yorkshire Wolds before entering the area of glacial and alluvial deposits of Holderness. The river bed varies in composition reflecting the underlying geology. In the upper reaches of the river water crowfoot, lesser water parsnip, mares tail and spiked <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> may be found in the main channel whilst the marginal vegetation is composed of branched bur-reed, common reed and reed sweetgrass.|$|R
30|$|Background, aim, {{and scope}} The use of plant {{protection}} products is common practice in modern agriculture and forestry. Their use, however, may result in risks for the environment because even correct application can not always prevent a possible contamination of the off-field environment. A contamination of surface waters may occur through driftage, precipitation, run-off and drainage from treated surfaces. Dicotyledonous macrophytes {{are not part of}} the initial risk assessment of {{plant protection products}} in the aquatic environment although they are an important part of the ecosystem. This paper presents a standardised single-phase test system with the dicotyledonous <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> Myriophyllum spicatum (Haloragaceae).|$|R

50|$|Rice is {{the main}} aquatic plant grown for human food, but smaller areas of {{watercress}} and water chestnut are also cultivated. In their native environments, aquatic weeds {{are part of a}} balanced ecosystem, and it is mainly introduced species of water plant that become invasive and cause problems by congesting water bodies. The worst culprits, found in both temperate and tropical waterways, are floating plants such as water hyacinth, water lettuce and Salvinia, fully submerged rooting plants such as Hydrilla and <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> and rooting plants that reach the surface such as cattail, papyrus, bulrush and reed.|$|R
50|$|Eurasian watermilfoil has slender stems up to 175 cm long. The {{submerged}} leaves (usually between 15-35 mm long) are borne in pinnate whorls of four, {{with numerous}} thread-like leaflets roughly 4-13 mm long. Plants are monoecious with flowers {{produced in the}} leaf axils (male above, female below) on a spike 5-15 cm long held vertically above the water surface, each flower inconspicuous, orange-red, 4-6 mm long. Eurasian <b>water</b> <b>milfoil</b> has 12- 21 pairs of leaflets while northern watermilfoil M. sibiricum only has 5-9 pairs. The two can hybridize and the resulting hybrid plants can cause taxonomic confusion as leaf characters are intermediate and can overlap with parent species.|$|R
