40|$|Adaptive {{morphing}} {{trailing edge}} technology {{offers the potential}} to decrease the fuel burn of transonic transport aircraft by allowing wings to dynamically adjust to changing flight conditions. Current air-craft use flap and aileron droop to adjust the wing during flight. However, this approach offers {{only a limited number}} of degrees of freedom, and the gaps in the wing created when using these devices introduce unnecessary drag. Morphing trailing edge technology offers more degrees of freedom, with a seamless interface between the wing and control surfaces. In this paper we seek to quantify the extent to which this technology can improve the fuel burn of transonic commercial transport sized aircraft. Starting from the undeformed Common Research Model (uCRM) geometry, we perform fixed-planform aerostructural optimizations of a standard wing, a wing retrofitted with a morphing trailing edge, and a clean sheet wing designed with the morphing trailing edge. The wing retrofitted with the morphing trailing edge improved the fuel burn as effectively as the full wing redesign with-out morphing. Additional fuel burn reductions were observed for the clean sheet design. The morph-ing trailing edge decreased the fuel burn by performing load alleviation at the maneuver condition, weakening the trade-off between cruise performance and maneuver structural constraints, resulting in lighter <b>wingboxes</b> and more aerodynamically efficient cruise configurations.

40|$|In {{aeroelastic}} {{research the}} interaction between the structural wing and the aerodynamics is investigated. Currently the <b>wingbox</b> structures, as other components, are manufactured out of composite materials to replace the metallic airplanes. Composites have the ability to be designed by defining the orientation and thickness of a laminate. This property {{can be used in a}} process to minimize the <b>wingbox</b> weight under aeroelastic loads which is called aeroelastic tailoring or optimisation. The main advantage of a lighter <b>wing(box)</b> design is the lower fuel consumption of the aircraft during its lifetime. Werter and Breuker (2015) have developed the Proteus tool to perform aeroelastic tailoring on a <b>wingbox</b> structure. An interface is created to export the <b>wingbox</b> model to Nastran using ModGen (Software developed by DLR). The Nastran model is further enhanced by using the internal gradient based optimizer to tailor the <b>wingbox</b> structure. Goal of this thesis is twofold. First the 1 D Proteus model is verified using the extension to Nastran. Secondly the influence of engine position and sweep on the optimized <b>wingbox</b> weight of the One Engine Reference Model (OERM) is investigated. The designed Nastran interface performs the optimisation. In the Nastran model the skin and spars are optimized for. Ribs should be present such that the cross-section does not deform too much. The ribs themselves are not optimized. No topology optimisation is performed, the dimension and locations of spars and ribs are inputs to the model. A linear analysis is performed in Nastran. Four different analysis types are defined: aeroelastic deflection, flutter, divergence and static point deflection. The tailoring will be performed under different optimisation constraints for each type of analysis. For the first type the strains should be below the allowable and the tip rotation may not exceed 12 deg. The second and third condition refer to flutter and divergence which may not occur for the given flight condition. The last case limits for example the engine displacement during landing. The strains are also limited for this load case. To verify the correct implementation of the model a verification procedure has been performed. For a simple rectangular beam the deformation is compared to elementary mechanics. In the next verification step a <b>wingbox</b> structure is considered and the results are compared to Proteus (Werter and Breuker, 2015). For similar flight conditions under a given Mach number similar results are obtained. The divergence pressure between the two models is comparable. To investigate the influence of engine location and sweep the One Engine Reference Model (OERM) is taken as a reference. The Proteus model predicts analogous aeroelastic behaviour compared to the Nastran model. The Proteus model therefore is verified. For the optimisation six load cases are defined. These are derived from the flight envelope as set by airworthiness authorities. The load cases consist out of four aeroelastic flight conditions: cruise, symmetric push down and two different symmetric pull up conditions. Next a stability load case is added as no divergence and flutter may occur. The various engine locations on the OERM are optimized with and without landing load case to see the influence of landing on the engine location. The lightest <b>wingbox</b> design was found for an engine located around 70 % of the span. This design violates the landing load case. Considering the landing load case the lightest <b>wingbox</b> design is found at 50 % of the span. Compared to the baseline model a <b>wingbox</b> weight reduction of 18 % is achieved. If the engine is placed further towards the tip a lot of additional material is required for the engine to not hit the runway. An engine location further down the span is preferred as the engine has a relief effect on the wing lowering the (upward) deflection and thereby lowering the critical strains. The thickness and stiffness distribution creates a tip down deformation of the wing. Next the quarter chord sweep of the OERM is varied. For a swept forward wing the <b>wingbox</b> weight is higher compared to the swept backward <b>wingbox</b> design. Additional stiffness is required to prevent wing divergence. The optimum <b>wingbox</b> weight is found for a sweptback wing of 50 deg. Comparing the design to the baseline model a weight reduction of only 4. 3 % is achieved. However sweeping the wing comes at the cost of a higher angle of attack during cruise as the produced lift reduces for higher sweep angles. As with the optimized engine location <b>wingbox</b> the stiffness and thickness distribution is as such that a tip down deformation of the wing results during the aeroelastic load cases. Performing an aeroelastic gradient based optimisation using Nastran is possible. Great caution is advised with the Nastran optimizer as the end result is dependent on the type of optimisation performed. The model can be further extended to take ribs and buckling into account. An external optimizer could be considered to have larger control over the optimisation process.

40|$|The {{implementation}} of key technologies {{in the initial}} stages of the aircraft wing design process has always represented a substantial challenge for aircraft designers. The lack of reliable and accessible wing mass prediction methods ¬which allow assessment of the relative benefits of new technologies for reducing structural wing weight - is of significant importance. This necessitates the development of new and generally applicable wing mass estimation methods. This thesis aims to create a new framework for estimating the mass of metallic and composite transport aircraft wings via finite element multidisciplinary analysis, and design optimisation techniques. To this end, the multidisciplinary static strength and stiffness, dynamic aeroelastic stability, and manufacturing constraints are simultaneously addressed within an optimisation environment through a gradient-based search algorithm. A practical optimisation procedure is presented as part of the sizing optimisation process, with enhanced features in solving large-scale nonlinear structural optimisation problems, incorporating an effective initial design variable value generation scheme based on the concept of the fully stressed design. The applicability and accuracy of the proposed approaches is accomplished by conducting a number of case studies in which the <b>wingbox</b> structure of the public domain NASA wing - commonly referred to as the Common Research Model (CRM) - is optimised to produce a minimum mass design. The results of a case study examining minimisation of the mass of the CRM <b>wingbox</b> structures designed using four different models of increasing structural fidelity prove that the multidisciplinary design optimisation framework can successfully calculate the mass of realistic real-world aircraft wing designs. This provides an insight into the competence of certain <b>wingbox</b> models in predicting the mass of the metallic and composite primary wing structures to an acceptable level of accuracy, and in demonstrating the relative merits of the <b>wingbox</b> structural complexity models under consideration and the computational resources necessary to achieving the required degree of accuracy [...] .
