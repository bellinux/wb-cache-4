500|$|In December 2016 {{the band}} {{revealed}} {{they were in}} the process of recording more material for a deluxe edition re-release of the album. [...] "It's a double album at this point and it’s more of an extension of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> the studio earlier. Some of the songs were songs that we did not put on the first album, but are great songs. And some are brand new that we just wrote last week," [...] Hoppus said to Billboard. On February 28, 2017, Hoppus replied to a message on Twitter in regards of the deluxe edition, stating that it is set to release on May 19, 2017. On March 16, 2017, [...] "Parking Lot" [...] was released as the first song from the deluxe edition.|$|E
500|$|When Project 86 {{released}} their self-titled record, {{they were}} generally acknowledged to be a rapcore band. Schwab has maintained {{it was never}} intentional, [...] "I think we got lumped in with that music because we [...] toured with P.O.D. and Linkin Park." [...] According to writer Mark Allan Powell, the music featured [...] "cryptic, down-tuned guitars" [...] and [...] "half-spoken, half-rapped" [...] vocals. Drawing Black Lines saw their style adopt elements of traditional metal, groove metal, and hard rock. The band used their song [...] "Pipedream" [...] as a blueprint to build the album: [...] "We knew {{that was one of}} the brightest spots on the album," [...] said Schwab, [...] "I just wanted to take <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> 'Pipedream' and go further with it". Experimentation with noise occurred in track [...] "Twenty-Three", and would be revisited on their fourth album with [...] "Circuitry".|$|E
500|$|According to Field, the {{transition}} from writing music for an adult rock band to writing children's music was not a big one for The Wiggles. [...] "The Wiggles music isn't all that far removed from <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> The Cockroaches, just a different subject matter", Field stated. [...] "The Cockroaches sing about girls and love and stuff like that; The Wiggles sing about hot potatoes and cold spaghetti." [...] Moran stated that The Wiggles wrote songs they liked and would listen to, and then made them appropriate for children. [...] They approached simple and relocatable topics, such as food and nutrition, as teachers would in a pre-school setting, with simple melodies that were easy for children to sing and remember. [...] The group sang the same 60s-style pop as The Cockroaches, but with different lyrics, although they were not confined to songs about love and could write about anything that interested and excited young children, which was limitless. [...] The music they chose to write and perform was influenced by nursery rhymes, folk music, and rock songs of the 1950s and 1960s. [...] Page reported, [...] "First and foremost, we're entertainers". [...] The Wiggles captured the interest of children by first entertaining them, and then by presenting them with educational messages.|$|E

500|$|In early 1991, Anthony Field founded The Wiggles, a children's music group, {{with fellow}} {{university}} students Murray Cook and Greg Page, Phillip Wilcher (from Macquarie University's music department) and The Cockroaches' band mate, Jeff Fatt. In July, they issued their debut album, The Wiggles, which {{was dedicated to}} Paul Field's daughter and sold 70,000 copies. The Wiggles {{went on to become}} [...] "a global powerhouse in children's entertainment". They used former The Cockroaches' members for musical and performing support: Paul, John, and Henry (The Wiggles' character Henry the Octopus was named after him) performed with them on their CDs, DVDs, and stage shows. John helped them write many of their songs. Many early The Wiggles' songs were The Cockroaches' tunes reworked to fit the genre of children's music. According to Anthony, [...] "The Wiggles music isn't all that far removed from <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> The Cockroaches, just a different subject matter... The Cockroaches sing about girls and love and stuff like that; The Wiggles sing about hot potatoes and cold spaghetti". Paul worked for James Roland Wood, Chief Judge at Common Law, for three years after the band stopped regularly performing and during The Wiggles' formation, which he said gave Anthony time to develop his new band alone, without much input from his brothers. In the mid-1990s, Paul became The Wiggles' talent manager.|$|E
500|$|November's {{first game}} {{was at the}} Mata Real against Paços de Ferreira. Benfica scored first with a header by Cristian Rodríguez, but Tiago Valente tied the game {{a few minutes later}} for Paços. In the 85th minute, Kostas Katsouranis scored Benefica's winning goal with an assist by Rodríguez. To Camacho, the win was [...] "difficult but very important". On 6 November, Benfica played Celtic on the road. In their second game against the team, Benfica lost 1–0 on a goal by Aiden McGeady. With the loss, Benfica was in last place and needed to defeat Milan to remain in the Champions League. Although Camacho was optimistic, he was aware of the high stakes. On 11 November, Benfica hosted Boavista in search of their fourth {{consecutive}} win in the Primeira Liga. Cardozo scored in the first half, with Boavista tying the score in the 58th minute. Benfica then scored five goals in the final 40 minutes for a 6–1 win. After the match, Rui Costa said, [...] "We had our fourth consecutive win in the Primeira Liga, and I think we are on the right track." [...] After a third international break, Benfica resumed on the 24th with an away game against Académica. Lito scored first for Académica, but a free kick by Rui Costa tied the game. Académica goalkeeper Ricardo made two errors, allowing Luisão and Adu to score Benfica's second and third goals, and Camacho credited the late win to his players' perseverance and commitment. November ended with a decisive match against Milan. Andrea Pirlo scored for Benfica, but Maxi Pereira's 23th-minute shot tied the game. Benfica's fate was determined by events in Glasgow, as Celtic defeated Shakhtar Donetsk with an added-time goal. Camacho bemoaned his team's luck: [...] "We're a bit unhappy. For <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> this competition I think we should have had more of a chance to go through, so for me football has not been fair to Benfica." ...|$|E

60|$|Then {{we began}} to wander through the wood of error; we tried {{speaking}} through music in the ordinary way under I know not whose evil influence, until we got to hate the two competing tunes and rhythms that were so often at discord with one another, the tune and rhythm of the verse and the tune and rhythm of the music. Then we tried, persuaded by somebody who thought quarter-tones and less intervals the especial mark of speech as distinct from singing, to write out <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>did</b> <b>in</b> wavy lines. On finding something like these lines in Tibetan music, we became so confident that we covered {{a large piece of}} pasteboard, which now blows up my fire in the morning, with a notation in wavy lines as a demonstration for a lecture; but at last Mr. Dolmetsch put us back to our first thought. He made us a beautiful instrument half psaltery half lyre which contains, I understand, all the chromatic intervals within the range of the speaking voice; and he taught us to regulate our speech by the ordinary musical notes.|$|E
