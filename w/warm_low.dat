50|$|Canopy {{temperature}} {{depression is}} highly suitable for selecting physiologically superior lines in <b>warm,</b> <b>low</b> relative humidity environments where high evaporative demand leads to leaf cooling {{of up to}} 10 °C below ambient temperatures. This permits differences among genotypes to be detected relatively easily using infrared thermometry. However, such differences cannot be detected in high relative humidity environments because the effect of evaporative cooling of leaves is negligible. Nonetheless, leaves maintain their stomata open to permit the uptake of CO2, and differences {{in the rate of}} CO2 fixation may lead to differences in leaf conductance that can be measured using a porometer. Porometry can be used to screen individual plants. The heritability of stomatal conductance is reasonably high, with reported values typically in the range of 0.5 to 0.8. Plants can be assessed for leaf conductance using a viscous flow porometer that is available on the market (Thermoline and CSIRO, Australia). This instrument can give a relative measure of stomatal conductance in a few seconds, making it possible to identify physiologically superior genotypes from within bulks.|$|E

40|$|Discoasters are {{the remains}} of an enigmatic group of nannoplankton, whose last representatives {{disappeared}} globally at 1. 89 Ma. The one million years prior to their extinction has been analysed in high time resolution and a global database has been developed from ten sites in the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. It {{has been shown that}} the variability in Discoaster abundance at low latitudes cannot be attributed solely to changes in sea-surface temperature; discoasters were demonstrated to be suppressed at upwelling sites. In combination with global satellite images of phytoplankton blooms (Lewis, 1989) and maps of modern sea-surface temperatures (CLIMAP, 1981), Discoaster abundance variations were interpreted in terms of the interplay between productivity pressure and sea-surface temperature. Discoasters thrived in the Indian Ocean at Site 709 (4 °S) in warm waters with little productivity pressure, whereas Discoaster abundance was suppressed at Sites 677 (l°N) and 662 (l°S) in the Pacific and Atlantic, which although located in warm waters, were affected by upwelling. In addition to the reduced Discoaster abundances associated with upwelling, sea-surface temperature gradients are a significant factor when comparing high and low latitude sites. A marked drop in Discoaster abundance is apparent between 41 °N and 56 °N (i. e., between Sites 607 and 552). Relative abundances of species in the Discoaster assemblage revealed clearly their contrasting environmental preferences; D. brouweri was produced under a wide range of conditions, favouring <b>warm,</b> <b>low</b> productivity waters; D. asymmetricus and D. tamalis were produced in higher abundances relative to D. brouweri during cooler, low productivity episodes; D. pentaradiatus showed highest absolute abundance in <b>warm,</b> <b>low</b> productivity waters, although increasing in relative abundance at higher latitudes; D. surculus increased in relative abundance in high productivity regions and in cooler waters.

Thick {{layers of}} <b>warm,</b> <b>low</b> density ionized {{hydrogen}} (i. e., the warm ionized medium or WIM) in spiral galaxies provide direct evidence for {{an interaction between}} the disk and halo. The wide-spread ionization implies that a significant fraction of the Lyman continuum photons from O stars, produced primarily in isolated star forming regions near the midplane and often surrounded by opaque clouds of neutral hydrogen, is somehow able to propagate large distances through the disk and into the halo. Moreover, even though O stars {{are the source of}} the ionization, the temperature and ionization state of the WIM differ significantly from what is observed in the classical O star H ii regions. Therefore, the existence of the WIM and observations of its properties provide information about the structure of the interstellar medium and the transport of energy away from the midplane as well as place significant constraints on models. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Because of {{the dynamic}} nature of the {{interstellar}} medium, the Sun should have encountered {{a variety of different}} interstellar environments in its lifetime. As the solar wind interacts with the surrounding interstellar medium to form a heliosphere, different heliosphere shapes, sizes, and particle contents result from the different environments.

The heliospheric size, expressed as distance of the nose of the heliopause to the Sun, is set by the solar wind- interstellar pressure balance, even for extreme cases. Other heliospheric boundary locations and neutral particle results correlate with the interstellar parameters as well. If the H ◦ clouds identified in the Millennium Arecibo survey are typical of clouds encountered by the Sun, then the Sun spends ∼ 99. 4 % of the time in <b>warm</b> <b>low</b> density ISM, where the typical upwind heliosphere radii are up to two orders of magnitude larger than at present...|$|E

Fifteen healthy volunteers received three levels of thermal stimuli (<b>warm,</b> <b>low</b> pain and high pain) and subsequently were asked to recall and then rate this experience. Neuroimaging results reveal that recalling a previous sensory experience activates an extensive network of classical pain processing structures except the contralateral posterior insular cortex. Nociceptive-specific activation of this structure and the rated intensity difference between physical and recalled pain events allow us to investigate the link between the quality of the original nociceptive stimulus and the mental trace, as well as the differences between the accompanying neural responses. Additionally, by incorporating the behavioural ratings, we explored which brain regions were separately responsible for generating either an accurate or vivid recall of the physical experience.

The Indonesian Throughflow Water (ITW) adds freshwater into the Indian Ocean as it spreads by the advection and diffusion within the Indian Ocean's South Equatorial Current (SEC). The low salinity throughflow trace, centered along 12 øS, stretches across the Indian Ocean, separating the monsoon dominated regime of the northern Indian Ocean from the more typical subtropical stratification to the south.

The ITW transport within the SEC varies from 4 to 12 x 10 6 m 3 sec- 1, partly in response to variations of the injection rate at the eastern boundary and to the likelihood of a zonally elongated recirculation cell between the Equatorial Counter Current and the SEC within the Indian Ocean.
