5|$|Aside {{from the}} rivalry and bowl implications, this game also decided who would {{represent}} the South Division at the Big 12 Championship Game in Kansas City. At {{the beginning of}} the week, Texas and Oklahoma were tied for the lead with Texas holding the tie-breaker due to their win in the Red River Rivalry earlier in the year. However, since Texas lost to Texas A on November 24, a Sooner victory at State would <b>win</b> <b>them</b> the division outright and let them play Nebraska for the Big12 title and a spot in the Fiesta Bowl (awarded contractually to the Big12 winner if they are not selected to play in the national championship game).|$|E
5|$|At the pay-per-view, Nikki turned heel {{by attacking}} Brie, which allowed McMahon {{to win the}} match. The next several weeks saw the twins fight in several {{backstage}} and in-ring segments, including a cameo appearance from Jerry Springer on Raw on September 8. As part of the storyline, McMahon declared Nikki {{the face of the}} WWE Divas division and granted her a match at Night of Champions for the Divas Championship, which she failed to win. Nikki then obtained permission to begin forcing Brie to compete in handicap matches, similar to her punishment at the hands of McMahon, although Brie was able to <b>win</b> <b>them.</b> This led to a match between the twins at Hell in a Cell, where the loser was forced to become the winner's personal assistant for 30 days, in which Nikki defeated Brie. Five days later on SmackDown, Nikki won a Halloween costume battle royal to become the number one contender for the Divas Championship.|$|E

5|$|On 30 July 1996, {{for a world}} {{transfer}} record-breaking £15 million (equivalent to £ million today) Shearer {{joined his}} hometown club and league runners-up Newcastle United, managed by his hero Keegan. Shearer made his league debut away at Everton, on 17 August 1996, and maintained his form {{during the rest of}} the season, finishing as Premier League top-scorer for the third consecutive season with 25goals in 31 Premier League games, as well as winning another PFA Player of the Year accolade, despite a groin injury forcing him to miss seven matches. Perhaps his best performance of the season came on 2 February 1997, when Newcastle went into the final 15 minutes of the game 3–1 down at home to Leicester City in the league, only for Shearer to <b>win</b> <b>them</b> the game 4–3 by scoring a late hat-trick.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of Operation Auca began in September 1955.

Meanwhile, Elliot learned several phrases {{in the language of the}} Huaorani from Dayuma, a young Huaorani woman who had left her society and become friends with Rachel Saint, a missionary and the sister of Nate Saint. The missionaries hoped that by regularly giving gifts to the Huaorani and attempting to communicate with them in their language, they would be able to <b>win</b> <b>them</b> over as friends.|$|E
5|$|With {{the union}} {{threatening}} strike action, particularly at international matches, in April 1909 the Football Association insisted that all players agree {{to leave the}} union and pledge loyalty to the FA. Manchester United refused to issue the revised contracts to its players, and FA suspended the entire squad. The club then refused to pay the players in lieu of their suspension, and so the players instead took away ornaments from the club's office before Mangnall persuaded them to return the items. The players continued to train, and captain Charlie Roberts {{came up with the}} name of Outcasts F.C. The FA organised a meeting of 200 players, excluding the Outcasts, but a rambling speech from chairman Charles Clegg failed to <b>win</b> <b>them</b> over, and an agreement was reached where the PU would be recognised by the FA.|$|E

5|$|Barcelona begin {{start off}} {{the season with}} the {{traditional}} curtain raiser, the Supercopa de España, against Sevilla, losing the first leg 3–1 at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium. In the return leg at the Camp Nou, however, the team would win 4–0, thus claiming the Supercopa 5–3 on aggregate. In the 2010–11 season, Barcelona would endure a slow start to the campaign, despite a victory over Racing de Santander (3–0) on {{the opening day of}} the season; they would go on to be defeated 2–0 at the Camp Nou by newly promoted minnows Hércules. Nevertheless, Barça would recover and go on to magnificent 5–0 win over Real Madrid at home. In the Champions League semi-finals against Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu, Lionel Messi scored two goals to ensure a 0–2 win for Barcelona, with the second leg at home ending in a 1–1 draw, sending Barça through to the Final to take on Manchester United. In the Copa del Rey Final at the Mestalla Stadium against Real Madrid, Cristiano Ronaldo would convert a header on the 100th minute to win the Copa for Madrid, 1–0. Barça, however, would end up beating Manchester United 3–1 with goals from Pedro, Messi and David Villa to <b>win</b> <b>them</b> the Champions League for the fourth time in club history. Barcelona would also claim La Liga with 96 points to Real Madrid's 92 {{for the third time in}} a row to round off a very successful season.|$|E

While she is recovering at the hospital, an alive Victor arrives. A surprised Téa, Dani, and Jack welcome Victor back, while Todd tries to bond with his children. Todd remains concerned about Jack and Dani, attempting to buy their affections with money and deciding {{the best way to}} <b>win</b> <b>them</b> over is to call a truce with Victor. He also tries to win back Blair's affections. He eventually admits he only pretended to get along with Victor to lure him into a false sense of security. Victor admits that he poisoned Todd's scotch with arsenic and then tried to strangle him. Jack takes Todd to the hospital, where he recovers but is frustrated when his family continues to defend Victor. Victor realizes he must leave town and says goodbye to his family. Todd shows Blair a threatening note he received with the names of all his loved ones on it. The mysterious Tattoo Organization that held Victor demands that Todd find and kill Victor. Todd, Blair and Téa devise a scheme to fool this organization into believing Victor is dead. Feeling secure that their scheme has worked, they plan for a future. Todd receives another note by the Tattoo Organization, this time telling him that he failed them and that Victor has been recaptured. Todd is told that he must leave Llanview and go to the address given on the note. Todd and Blair are devastated.

25|$|The {{armies of}} Hamilcar and Agathocles clashed in the Battle of the Himera River in 311BC.

He gathered the survivors, burned his camp and withdrew to Gela. There he remained for some time to divert the Carthaginian army from Syracuse. This allowed the Syracusans to harvest their crops. Hamilcar first besieged the Gela, but gave up when he discovered that Agathocles had large supplies and enough soldiers to defend the city. He then visited the cities and strongholds which were still siding with Agathocles to <b>win</b> <b>them</b> over. Because they despised Agathocles they soon deserted to the Carthaginians.|$|E
25|$|Kurowski's {{works were}} {{published}} in Germany since 1958, but remained inaccessible to English-speaking audiences. J.J. Fedorowicz Publishing, whom Smelser and Davies describe as a leading publisher of war-romancing literature, released Kurowski's two popular works, Panzer Aces and Infantry Aces, in the U.S. in 1992 and 1994. In their analysis of the series, which also included Panzer Aces II and Panzer Aces III, Smelser and Davies write:Kurowski gives the readers an almost heroic version of the German soldier, guiltless of any war crimes, actually incapable of such behavior. (...) Sacrifice and humility are his hallmarks. Their actions <b>win</b> <b>them</b> medals, badges and promotions, yet they remain indifferent to these awards. The cover art evokes heroism, determination and might of the German soldier and his weapons.|$|E

Zoe McLellan (Logan St. Clair) was scheduled to appear again and Jason Gaffney (Conrad Bennish, Jr) from season one was confirmed for four episodes including the season finale.

25|$|Eager {{to expand}} his control, Jimmy turns his {{attention}} to the Preppies, the clique that consists of rich students.

In response, Jimmy signs up for a boxing tournament hosted by the Preppies' leader, Derby Harrington (John Lavelle). Though he wins, the Preppies refuse to accept defeat and gang up on him, resulting in a massive fight that ends with Jimmy declaring himself the new leader. With the Preppies subdued, Jimmy then sets out to conquer their rivals, the Greasers. Johnny Vincent (Rocco Rosanio), their leader, asks Jimmy to help him expose an affair between his girlfriend Lola Lombardi (Phoebe Strole), and Gord Vendome (Andrew Gehling), a member of the Preppies. The Preppies, angered by Jimmy's betrayal, abandon him, but he gradually wins back their trust. Gary manages to convince Johnny that Jimmy wants Lola, so he sets an ambush for him in a scrapyard. With Petey's help, Johnny is defeated and the Greasers recognize Jimmy as their superior. During this, Jimmy helps out a homeless man who pretend to be Santa Claus.|$|E
