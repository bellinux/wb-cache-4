2500|$|Now it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to shout! [...] "Where is she? Where is she? Where is she? I don't want to ram her!" [...] Everyone {{was out on}} {{the wing}} of the bridge except me and no one other than myself was talking.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout the year, Friedgen had {{challenged}} {{his players}} {{with the phrase}} [...] "Are you in or are you out?" [...] After the dramatic first-year turnaround, he was a high-profile candidate for an NFL position, and his players repeated his question. He remained at Maryland and said, [...] "Last year the kids {{made a commitment to}} me and I realized it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn.</b> We've got plenty left to do. This program has not yet arrived." ...|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn,</b> now, to {{enlighten}} Ezra Jennings. I stopped him, {{before he could}} say any more.|$|E
60|$|The number drawn to-night was One. On {{examination}} of the Purple Volume, it proved to <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to read again.|$|R
60|$|The number drawn {{this evening}} was Three. On the {{production}} of the corresponding manuscript it proved to <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to read again.|$|R
50|$|Le Passage du Rhin is a 1960 French film {{directed}} by André Cayatte. It {{was released in}} the USA as Tomorrow <b>is</b> <b>My</b> <b>Turn.</b>|$|R
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> {{to stare}} dumbly before I could manage to ask: “For Tolosa?” {{in a very}} knowing tone.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> now to hold HER. She {{tried to}} break away from me and get down first to the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> now {{to stare}} with {{surprise}} and curiosity. He hadn't been talking loud but {{he lowered his}} voice still more.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] he muttered, [...] "we must be friends, Elizabeth. Wenham had all {{the luck}} at first. Perhaps it's going to <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> now, eh?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now,' {{said the}} still undaunted Violet, when the torrent of unsparing jest had {{expended}} itself, 'now it <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn.</b> Let {{me show you}} one short piece. This--"To L."' ...|$|R
6000|$|Then Sir Sagramore said: [...] "Well, Sir Knight, {{that was}} certes {{a very great}} buffet that you gave my fellow, but now it <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to have ado with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|I lit. I drifted up to a gate with a {{swarm of}} people, and when it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> the head clerk says, in a business-like way-- ...|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to be surprised. If the Baron took a like {{cognizance}} {{of all my}} countrymen {{who came}} to New Orleans, he was a busy man indeed.|$|E
6000|$|It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> now {{to shake}} a doleful head. [...] "There are no extra instruments," [...] I told them. [...] "They too have {{disappeared}} {{as did the}} wireless apparatus." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let him laugh; it will <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> when I go home, {{with a fine}} cat over my shoulder," [...] thought Corny, tearing along, heedless of falls, scratches, {{and bruised}} knees.|$|R
6000|$|The Baroness met his eyes; she colored just a little. Then she rose. [...] "I {{should have}} the {{satisfaction}} of saying, 'Now it <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn.</b> I break with your serene highness!'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now it <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn,</b> old lady," [...] ejaculated Higgs, and {{straightway}} {{missed her}} clean {{from a distance}} of five yards. A second shot was more successful, and she rolled over, dead.|$|R
60|$|Now it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to {{be unable}} to speak and to feel my eyes fill with tears, tears of rage, for {{remember}} that I was still very feeble. But Marie spoke for me.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> {{to come to}} a {{standstill}} now. I tried vainly, in the gathering darkness, to see his face. In the surprise of the moment, I asked a little impatiently what he meant.|$|E
60|$|Now it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to be tempted, but I, too, overcame, and, sitting down, laid Higgs's head upon my knee; then, drop by drop, let {{a little}} of the water trickle between his swollen lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "Comrades, it <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> {{to throw}} in this great game. I have heard and {{considered}} all, and I think it best that I should be surrendered, with the Augusta, to the Greeks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No; I {{think it}} <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> then," [...] says the Colonel, {{with a glance}} of kindness. The anger has {{disappeared}} from under his brows; {{at that moment the}} menaced battle is postponed.|$|R
6000|$|Eva {{looked up}} with some anxiety in her frank eyes as she said, [...] "Now it <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn.</b> Must I give up my dear homely books, and take to Ruskin, Kant, or Plato?" ...|$|R
60|$|At {{this point}} it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to shiver and become pale, as any may guess who may have chanced to read the history of Mameena, and the turn of Miss Holmes to watch me with {{animated}} interest.|$|E
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> now to stop suddenly. In {{the excited}} state of my curiosity, at that moment, the chance {{reference}} to Mr. Fairlie's place of residence, {{on the lips}} of my strange companion, staggered me with astonishment.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Staveley {{declined}} {{to tell me}} whether she had offered a bright example of gratitude {{to the rest of}} the sex. When I asked why, she declared that it <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> now to tell her what I had been doing.|$|E
6000|$|... "This <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn,</b> brother," [...] Harry pleaded. [...] "If you go the campaign, I {{ought to}} have the other affair. Indeed, indeed, I ought." [...] And he prayed for this bit of promotion.|$|R
6000|$|... "Three {{times you}} have saved my life, Allan--once at Maraisfontein, once from starvation, and now from Dingaan, whose touch {{would have meant}} my death. I wonder whether it will ever <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to save yours?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hah," [...] quoth Sir Ector, [...] "that {{was a very}} {{wonderful}} buffet you struck my fellow. But now it <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to have ado with you, and I hope God {{will send}} me a better fortune." ...|$|R
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to flush, but I did not. I {{felt that}} she was poking fun at me, and I admired a brave heart that could look for humour on the road to death, and so I laughed with her.|$|E
6000|$|The reply fretted me. I wanted bare facts just then. [...] "Why {{are you so}} angry? What is your name? And {{where do}} you live?" [...] It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to ask questions, and I popped them out {{as if from a}} Little by Little.|$|E
60|$|Next {{morning it}} <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn,</b> for I {{was the only}} aide-de-camp left. I was his {{favourite}} aide-de-camp. His heart went out always to a smart soldier. I declare that I think {{there were tears in}} his black eyes when he sent for me that morning.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, it <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> {{to dictate}} terms, Alan. You {{know what they}} are. The thing is quite simple. Come, don't work {{yourself}} into this fever. The thing has to be done. Face it, and do it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{that would}} be the best plan," [...] Harry agreed. [...] "Now I will go back and take Bertie's place. It <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to <b>be</b> on watch, and he will be wanting to hear the news." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Had {{you seen}} Isabel's eye {{when she looked}} on the wild crowd, you would know how little she would heed worse {{persecution}} than my poor aunt could practise. It will soon <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>turn</b> to say you don't deserve her.' ...|$|R
