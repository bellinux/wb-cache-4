2500|$|After the 6th Army {{defeated}} the Soviet forces at the Second Battle of Kharkov it drove {{toward the city}} of Stalingrad. The 6th Army attacked Stalingrad directly. Paulus was gravely concerned about becoming encircled and tasked Strecker's 11th Corps with protecting the northern flank, on the 6th Army's left, telling Wilhelm Adam that he knew Strecker very well {{and that he was}} [...] "a man <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> things to." [...] Strecker and other senior commanders in the 6th Army supported a strategic withdrawal to protect their flanks and take up better positions, but this was refused by Hitler. In November the Red Army attacked as part of Operation Uranus and within days Strecker {{and the rest of the}} Army were surrounded. Strecker led his corps in a counterattack straight into the encircling forces in order to avoid being cut off from the rest of the 6th Army. He was forced to abandon most of his heavy equipment in order to accomplish this maneuver.|$|E

No one can exist without a natural material support of the life he or she enjoys. All economic development plans must include environmental and human civilizationâ€™s protection implicitly. Integrated resource planning must be done in an absolutely judicious manner, so <b>we</b> <b>can</b> all <b>leave</b> as a legacy for future generations both a clean environment, {{as well as a}} healthy and prosperous human civilization. Key words: {{sustainable development}}, environmental protection, integrated resource planning, energy types, energy quality...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We have {{developed}} a new technique for weak lensing analysis, specifically designed to correct accurately for {{the effect of the}} point spread function (PSF) on the shapes of small galaxy images. This method does not rely on weighted second moments of detected images, which <b>we</b> show <b>can</b> <b>leave</b> residuals at the level of a percent in the shear; rather, we directly fit observed galaxy images as PSF-convolved, sheared circular sources. We show by means of simulations that this technique is able to recover shears with systematic errors well below the percent level for representative PSF shapes, while its noise properties are similar to existing methods...|$|R
