50|$|The British {{captured}} Martinique {{again in}} 1809. During their attack, Commander Charles John Napier of the brig-sloop Recruit noticed that Fort Edward, as he termed it, appeared abandoned. He took a gig and with four men, landed, scaled the fort's <b>walls,</b> and <b>hoisted</b> a British flag. Sir Alexander Cochrane immediately landed marines {{to occupy the}} fort and turn its mortars, which its fleeing garrison had not spiked, against the French.|$|R
500|$|The {{sides of}} the {{circular}} turrets were 12 inches thick, and they had [...] roofs. The conning tower had [...] <b>walls.</b> Turret <b>hoists,</b> voicepipes and electrical leads were protected by armored tubes. The lateral hydraulic pipes that ran along {{the underside of the}} gun deck were initially unprotected, but armored tubes were installed to protect them during Texass 1902 refit. Along the center of the ship, they were one inch thick, but increased to two inches closer to the {{sides of the}} ship.|$|R
2500|$|Following repairs, Recruit {{participated in}} the {{invasion}} of Martinique in January 1809. Napier observed that Fort Edward at Fort Royal Bay appeared abandoned. He took a gig and with four men, landed, scaled the fort's <b>walls,</b> and <b>hoisted</b> a British flag. Sir Alexander Cochrane immediately landed marines to occupy the fort and turn its mortars, which had not been spiked, against the French. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issuance of the Naval General Service Medal with clasp [...] "Martinique" [...] to all survivors of the campaign.|$|R

60|$|Stanley shrank {{back into}} his cell, took up the bundle of clothes that served as his pillow, got on to the bed and, {{standing}} on it, {{was able to get}} his fingers on {{to the top of the}} <b>wall.</b> He <b>hoisted</b> himself up, made his way through the boughs of the roof, and dropped on to the ground outside. Then he went round by the back of the temple, until he stood outside the priest's cell, and could hear the voices within without difficulty.|$|R
6000|$|... "Gentlemen, {{draw your}} swords and give these rough fellows the lesson they need;" [...] and, setting the example, he rode at the butcher and cut him down. The {{idea that the}} Burgundian knights would venture to force a passage {{in the teeth of}} the {{prohibition}} of the master of the butchers had apparently not so much as entered the minds of the guard, {{and as soon as the}} knights and their followers fell upon them, the greater portion of them flung down their arms and fled, a few only fighting stoutly until overpowered. As soon as the skirmish was over the keys were brought out from the guard- room, and the gate unlocked and the massive bars taken down. In the meantime some of the men-at-arms had run up on to the <b>wall,</b> <b>hoisted</b> the portcullis, and lowered the drawbridge across the fosse. As soon as they returned and mounted the party rode through. As they did so, four men ran out from a lane near the wall and followed them; and Guy at once recognized in them the archer and his three companions. Greatly pleased, he returned to the city and informed Dame Margaret of what had taken place.|$|R
50|$|Tub boat lifts {{consisted}} of a moveable hoist travelling on four toothed wheels engaging with two toothed wooden rails, one mounted on each supporting <b>wall.</b> The <b>hoist</b> possessed two drums around which the lifting cables were wound. The lifting ropes passed through pulley blocks before being attached to lifting eyes on the boats to make the lift easier. Four men would wind the hoist when lifting a full 2.5 to 3 tonne tub boat until it was high enough to pass over the dam of the upper canal.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is substantially intact, particularly the upper floors, with visible {{evidence of the}} timber columns and beams, timber flooring, brick <b>walls</b> and service <b>hoist.</b> Considerable settlement of the upper floors is evident. Alterations to the building include the removal of some floor structure and the insertion of partitioning to accommodate a cinema and cafeteria.|$|R
50|$|The Rococo-style mansion {{consists}} of three storeys and a mansard roof with black-glazed tiles. It is nine bays wide and three bays deep. The front has a three-bay central projection tipped by a triangular pediment with arched niche. A one-bay projection on the northeast gable continues in a tall <b>wall</b> dormer with <b>hoist,</b> testifying to the building's dual function as both warehouse and residence.|$|R
50|$|Hundreds {{of angry}} civilians {{flocked to the}} shrine upon overhearing the mullah's accusation. Police arrived and {{attempted}} to lead Farkhunda to a local precinct building one mile away, but she refused, asking for a female police officer to accompany her. The mob was able to drag Farkhunda away into the street where they knocked {{her to the ground}} and began beating and kicking her. More police arrived, firing warning shots into the air and temporarily dispersing the crowd. They moved her into the shrine in an attempt to shield her. As the crowd grew in size and rumors that she was working with Americans began circulating, the mob attempted to storm the shrine's <b>walls.</b> Police <b>hoisted</b> her onto the roof of the building in an escape attempt, but Farkhunda slipped and fell into the crowd.|$|R
50|$|Addition took 285 microseconds and {{multiplication}} 20 milliseconds, making arithmetic operations {{much faster}} than the Harvard Mark I. Data {{that had to be}} retrieved quickly was held in electronic circuits; the remainder was stored in relays and as holes in three continuous card-stock tapes that filled another <b>wall.</b> A chain <b>hoist</b> was needed to lift the heavy reels of paper into place. The machine read instructions or data from 30 paper tape readers connected to three punches, and another a table look-up unit consisted of another 36 paper tape readers. A punched card reader was used to load data, and results were produced on punched cards or high-speed printers. The 19-digit word was stored on the card stock tape or registers in binary coded decimal, resulting in 76 bits, with two extra bits for indicating positive or negative sign and parity, while the two side rows were used for sprockets. The familiar 80 columns of IBM punched card technology were recorded sideways as one column of the tape.|$|R
