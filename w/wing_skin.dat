25|$|Trials of an {{airborne}} sideways-firing 75mm gun {{were carried}} out with the AB-20 prototype modified as the AB-22. Firing trials were halted after damage was caused to the lower <b>wing</b> <b>skin</b> by blast from the gun muzzle.|$|E
25|$|The sole {{prototype}} AB-20, {{with a crew}} of five, modified with a 75mm gun firing sideways. Test firing {{took place}} at Cazaux in September 1934, but was terminated after five rounds had been fired due to structural damage to the lower <b>wing</b> <b>skin.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>wing</b> <b>skins</b> of the {{prototype}} Super are thick ones made from magnesium that allow fewer wing ribs to be used. Later Supers built used aluminium <b>wing</b> <b>skins,</b> including the conforming certification prototype. Despite the improvements, the Super's glider ratio and minimum sink rates are {{identical to the}} Standard's.|$|R

5000|$|Wing {{structure}} {{composed of}} spars with caps pre-machined from solid aluminium plate and aluminium <b>wing</b> <b>skins</b> bonded to closely spaced foam ribs ...|$|R
25|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation by}} the NTSB showed that the wing's lower spar cap had extensive stress fatigue and had fractures through the lower spar cap, vertically up the spar web and into the upper spar cap. The lower <b>wing</b> <b>skin</b> also found signs of fatigue in the area adjacent to the cracked spar cap. An examination of two other similar aircraft showed that the area of cracking was hidden from view by other fuselage structure.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the very}} {{enlarged}} wing, an empty RB-57D weighed {{not much more}} than an empty B-57 due to the lightening measures taken. The most extreme measures were taken with the wings, which were thin metal honeycomb sections that formed a full wet wing (even in the leading edges). To avoid the weight of rivets, the wings were assembled with a special glue. The <b>wing</b> <b>skin</b> was waxed for aerodynamic smoothness. With a surface skin of only 0.010inch thick, dropping a small tool on the wing could damage the skin. Even deicing fluid used on the aircraft could potentially cause the glue used to lose strength.|$|E
25|$|In February 2017, {{it passed}} 90% of the static {{ultimate}} load test (150% {{of the highest}} load in operation) at the TsAGI but failed the 100% test for which the wingbox will need 25kg reinforcements: this is common for new airliners like the Airbus A380, Boeing 787 or Mitsubishi MRJ, aiming for the smallest possible margin to avoid excess weight; it passed the limit load test (highest load during flight) which enables flight testing which should start in April. In May 2017, it was undergoing systems ground testing including its auxiliary power unit and taxiing tests. Cracks developed {{at the point of}} contact between the titanium beam and the composite <b>wing</b> <b>skin</b> in the wingbox.|$|E
25|$|The 1-23F was a 1-23E {{with the}} same 52.8 foot wings but was {{constructed}} with heavier gauge, butt-constructed <b>wing</b> <b>skins.</b> Only one was built.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was made from}} carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer and fiberglass with Kevlar <b>wing</b> <b>skins.</b> Its 15 m span wing initially employed a Wortmann FX 79-K-144 airfoil.|$|R
50|$|One Australian Chipmunk {{was fitted}} with a 180 hp (134 kW) Lycoming O-360 {{flat-four}} piston engine, wingtip tanks, clear-view canopy and metal <b>wing</b> <b>skinning</b> as the Sundowner touring aircraft.|$|R
25|$|The D type was {{modified}} {{for use on}} unarmed, long-range photo-reconnaissance versions of the Spitfire, such as the P.R. Mk Id (P.R. versions {{described in more detail}} below), with weapon bays left empty, and the relatively heavy-skinned leading edge wing structure ahead of the main spar converted to integral auxiliary fuel tanks capable of carrying 66½ Imperial gallons (300 l) in addition to that stored in the fuselage tanks ahead of the cockpit. The filler caps were well outboard, between ribs 19 and 20 on the leading edge, because the wing tips were higher {{than the rest of the}} wing due to dihedral, and thus the only place a fuel filler cap could be located. An expansion and overflow vent was fitted to protect the tanks from bursting as the fuel vaporized and expanded from the hot sun beating directly on the thin metal <b>wing</b> <b>skin</b> (which doubled as the walls of the tank). This vent was fitted further outboard, between ribs 20 and 21, in the highest space in the tank, where vapor would naturally collect.|$|E
2500|$|Stiffer skin is {{necessary}} for bat <b>wing</b> <b>skin</b> oriented in the direction parallel to the long axes of the bones to prevent too much deformation of bat <b>wing</b> <b>skin</b> during flight(with respect to the bone), resulting in the shearing of the bat <b>wing</b> <b>skin</b> off of the bone. Flexible skin {{is necessary}} for the direction perpendicular to the long axes of the bones for facilitating the shape changes needed for movement and control during flight. [...] This anisotropy of bat <b>wing</b> <b>skin</b> is also useful as method of storing and releasing elastic energy, particularly during the downstroke. During the downstroke, the bat extends its wing [...] and the <b>wing</b> <b>skin</b> experiences an aerodynamic force. The <b>wing</b> <b>skin</b> expands and [...] counteracts the aerodynamic force. After the wing is fully extended, the orientation of the wing is nearly vertical and the aerodynamic forces on the wing are reduced. As the aerodynamic force is reduced, the wing recoils, drawing the digits of the wings together in preparation for the upstroke.|$|E
2500|$|Bats rely on skin {{on their}} wings to {{generate}} lift and thrust used in flight. Therefore, {{the structure of}} the bat <b>wing</b> <b>skin</b> is different from the skin of the bat body. Bat <b>wing</b> <b>skin</b> consists of two thin layers of epidermis with a thin layer of dermis/hypodermis located between the epidermal layers whereas [...] the skin of the bat body consists of a single layer of epidermis with a thicker layer of dermis internal to the epidermis.|$|E
50|$|The company worked, for example, in {{the early}} 1950s with the famous Douglas DC-3 aircraft. In the mid-1950s, the company worked on the <b>wing</b> <b>skins</b> of Lockheed Super Constellation aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Proposed {{model with}} thicker <b>wing</b> <b>skins,</b> an empty weight of 455 lb, a {{maximum gross weight}} of 1150 lb, maximum speed of 225 kn and load limits of +11/-9g. None completed.|$|R
50|$|All-fiberglass glider, with {{foam core}} {{sandwiches}} for the <b>wing</b> <b>skins</b> and fuselage bulkheads. Internal tubular-steel frame interconnects the wings, cockpit and landing gear, carrying the flight and landing stresses. This steel frame is {{bolted to the}} fiberglass shell.|$|R
2500|$|As seen in snakes, local {{structural}} {{differences within}} {{the arrangement of}} the fibers change the mechanical properties of local area, but there are general characteristics that describe the mechanical behavior of bat <b>wing</b> <b>skin.</b> Within the mesh scaffolding of bat <b>wing</b> <b>skin,</b> collagen fibers cross bones perpendicular to the long axes of the bones, therefore mechanical properties of bat wing [...] skin oriented perpendicular to the long axes of the bones exhibit a lower stiffness than the skin that is oriented parallel to the long axes of the bodies.|$|E
2500|$|Within the dermal and {{epidermal}} {{layer of}} bat <b>wing</b> <b>skin,</b> the connective tissue and muscle fibers provide the structural support. The connective tissue fibers within bat <b>wing</b> <b>skin</b> consists of collagen and elastin fiber bundles {{arranged in a}} [...] "regular mesh like scaffolding", which the nerves, skeletal muscle fibers and blood vessels embed themselves into. Of the muscles that insert themselves into the mesh scaffolding, larger muscles anchor the skin to the bone and control the membrane tension and camber of the bat wing during flight, whereas smaller muscles, which originate from within the mesh scaffolding, attach to collagen fibers within the fiber network and modulate bone loading and allow for precise control of wing shape and tension.|$|E
2500|$|Its {{fuselage}} was slender, with {{a rounded}} cross-section. [...] The [...] water-cooled, double-supercharged, inverted V-12 Delage engine drove a large diameter, two blade propeller. Its radiators {{were in the}} wing. There were two on each side, one inboard and one outboard, both occupying the full chord and forming the <b>wing</b> <b>skin.</b> An open cockpit was placed a little {{in front of the}} trailing edge of the wing, within a narrow dorsal fairing which stretched over half the fuselage, starting close to the nose. The fuselage tapered rearwards to a conventional tail, with a round-tipped triangular tailplane, mounted at mid-fuselage, which had an adjustable angle of incidence. Its vertical tail was tall and slightly rounded and the unbalanced rudder extended down to the keel.|$|E
50|$|Also {{known as}} the RPV18-50 and the OPV18-50. Similar to the SV-2 with shorter wings and thicker <b>wing</b> <b>skins.</b> Originally powered by a Rotax 503 engine. Produced for General Atomics for {{evaluation}} in the Predator program. Only 1 built.|$|R
25|$|The {{two primary}} types of {{composite}} planes are moulded composite, where major structures like <b>wing</b> <b>skins</b> and fuselage halves are prepared and cured in moulds, and mouldless, where shapes are {{carved out of}} foam and then covered with fiberglass or carbon fiber.|$|R
50|$|IS-3c:The IS-3c was {{markedly}} different from its predecessors in having high-set 17 m span <b>wings,</b> <b>skinned</b> throughout with plywood, with three section differential ailerons and introducing speed-limiting airbrakes. The new long span wing {{was supported by}} a conventional fuselage, incorporating the streamlined enclosed cockpit and a conventional tail unit.|$|R
2500|$|A6M5c, Model 52丙 (Hei, c) – Armament change: One 13.2mm (.51in) Type 3 {{machine gun}} was added in each wing {{outboard}} of the cannon, and the 7.7mm {{gun on the}} left side of the cowl was deleted. [...] Four racks for rockets or small bombs were installed outboard of the 13mm gun in each wing. [...] Engine change: Some sources state that the hei had a Sakae 31 engine [...] In addition, a 55mm thick piece of armored glass was installed at the headrest and a plate of armor was installed behind the seat. [...] The mounting of the central 300L drop tank changed to a four-post design. [...] <b>Wing</b> <b>skin</b> was thickened further. The first of this variant was completed in September 1944. [...] Because of the gain in weight, this variant was used mainly for intercepting B-29s and special attack.|$|E
2500|$|Gliding, [...] Flying and Parachuting {{are some}} of the some methods of [...] aerial {{locomotion}} used by animals. Vertebrates have altered the structure of the skin to accommodate the stresses and strains of flight. Typically mammalian skin consists of collagen fibers arranged in a felt-work pattern, with no preferential fiber orientation. However, the structures of skin in bats, birds, and gliding lizards are very different from those of typical mammalian skin. The structural arrangement of the fibers within bat <b>wing</b> <b>skin</b> enables the bat to act like a spring during the down-stroke of flapping. The scales of gliding lizards are arranged in a regular rib like pattern to enable to lizard to act as an airfoil. [...] Avain skin must be structurally arranged such that [...] "the coat of feathers" [...] remains smooth and intact during flight.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the full}} company name (Rohrbach Metall-Flugzeugbau) makes clear, all Rohrbach {{aircraft}} were all-metal, including their duralumin skinning. The Robbe was a monoplane {{with a high}} wing described {{at the time as}} a semi-cantilever structure, meaning that there were no rigid wing struts but that it retained external bracing with flying wires to the wings from the lower fuselage. The wings were mounted with 5° of dihedral. In plan they were straight tapered, with unswept leading edges and blunt tips. Internally the wings were built around single box spars, assisted by leading edge and trailing edge boxes. The edge boxes also served as fuel tanks. At this time there were still doubts about the repairability of metal aircraft, so the Robbe's two-part wing was designed to be easy to inspect internally by the removal of the edge boxes and all parts were replaceable. [...] The <b>wing</b> <b>skin</b> was riveted to the ribs.|$|E
50|$|The SK-2 was {{a minimum}} change fighter {{derivative}} of the SK-1 {{with a normal}} protruding enclosed cockpit, normal light alloy <b>wing</b> <b>skinning,</b> enlarged fin and rudder, and two 12.7mm BS machine-guns in the top decking of the forward fuselage. Flown in October 1940 by G.M. Shiyanov, but no production was authorised.|$|R
50|$|The kit assembles in {{approximately}} 600 hours. It has bonded <b>wing</b> <b>skins</b> and incorporates 90° flaps for glide path control. The pod-and-boom fuselage {{consists of a}} welded steel tube truss encased in a fiberglass shell, with an aluminum tube for the tailboom. A spar fitting modification was released in 1983.|$|R
50|$|Like other Schreder designs the HP-16 is of {{all-metal}} construction, {{but with}} the <b>wing</b> <b>skins</b> bonded to foam ribs rather than using rivets to provide a smoother surface. The bonded construction also cut building time. The wing features the signature Schreder 90° flaps that allow steep descents {{and the use of}} small fields for landing.|$|R

50|$|Computer-aided {{design system}} was {{developed}} in 1969 for the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle, which first flew in 1974 along the Grumman F-14 Tomcat and both used Boron fiber composites in the tails; less expensive carbon fiber reinforced polymer were used for <b>wing</b> <b>skins</b> on the McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II, F/A-18 Hornet and Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit.|$|R

Its <b>wings,</b> <b>skinned</b> with birch plywood had a modified Mureau 234 section {{with a maximum}} thickness-to-chord ratio of 13.2%, notable for the large area of both upper and lower surfaces which were flat. There was dihedral over the whole wing and a full-span combination of inboard flaps and ailerons.|$|R
