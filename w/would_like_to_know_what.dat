500|$|Nathaniel Cary, {{the second}} pathologist, {{objected to the}} CPS's decision. Cary told The Guardian that the push had caused a {{haemorrhage}} to Tomlinson's abdomen, and the haemorrhage caused him to collapse. Cary said Tomlinson was vulnerable to this because he had liver disease. The CPS had erred in dismissing a charge of actual bodily harm (ABH), in his view. In a letter to Tomlinson's family, the CPS described Tomlinson's injuries as [...] "relatively minor" [...] and therefore insufficient to support such a charge. But Cary told The Guardian: [...] "The injuries were not relatively minor. He sustained quite a large area of bruising. Such injuries are consistent with a baton strike, which could amount to ABH. It's extraordinary. If that's not ABH I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> is." ...|$|E
500|$|After leaving Geneva on 8 February, the Hański family {{spent several}} months visiting {{the major cities}} of Italy. In Florence the {{sculptor}} Lorenzo Bartolini started work on a bust of Hańska. In the summer of 1834 they returned to Vienna, where they would stay for another year. During this time Balzac continued writing to Hańska, and by accident two especially amorous letters fell {{into the hands of}} her husband. He wrote to the French author, furious, and demanded an explanation. Balzac wrote to Hański claiming that it {{was nothing more than a}} game: [...] "One evening, in jest, she said to me that she <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> a love-letter was. This was said wholly without meaning.... I wrote those two unfortunate letters to Vienna, supposing that she remembered our joke...." [...] Hański apparently accepted the explanation, and invited Balzac to visit them in Vienna, which he did in May 1835.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1924, the trio {{returned}} to Norway where Asja subsequently left to live with an aunt in Nice and never returned. Although Quisling promised to provide for her well-being, his payments were irregular, and over the coming years he would miss a number of opportunities to visit. Back in Norway, and to his later embarrassment, Quisling found himself drawn into the communist Norwegian labour movement. Among other policies, he fruitlessly advocated a people's militia to protect the country against reactionary attacks, and asked members of the movement whether they <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> information the General Staff had on them, but he got no response. Although this brief attachment to the extreme left seems unlikely given Quisling's later political direction, Dahl suggests that, following a conservative childhood, he was by this time [...] "unemployed and dispirited... deeply resentful of the General Staff... {{in the process of}} becoming politically more radical." [...] Dahl adds that Quisling's political views at this time could be summarised as [...] "a fusion of socialism and nationalism," [...] with definite sympathies for the Soviet regime in Russia.|$|E

2500|$|The {{immediate}} {{results of}} the operation were disastrous for {{the image of the}} Air Corps. Speaker of the House Henry T. Rainey, echoing comments made by Gen. Billy Mitchell, criticized: [...] "If we are unfortunate enough to be drawn into another war, the Air Corps wouldn’t amount to much. If it is not equal to carrying the mail, I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> it would do in carrying bombs." [...] Despite the public humiliation, the Air Mail Fiasco resulted in a number of improvements for the Air Corps, bringing about changes that its previous publicity campaigns were unable to obtain.|$|E
