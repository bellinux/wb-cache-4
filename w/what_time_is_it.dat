500|$|Soon after Park {{returned}} to the United States, the South Korean public changed their perspective on the matter when they realized that his Myspace messages had been severely mistranslated and taken out of context, in addition to strong fan support for Park's return. Park was seen at b-boy battles with fellow Art of Movement members during his time in Seattle. However, on February 25, with Park's comeback {{looking more and more}} likely, JYP suddenly announced that Jay Park's contract with them had been terminated, citing a separate [...] "personal mistake" [...] that Park had made in 2009. JYP would make reference to this unknown event several times in 2010, but would never elaborate on any details. This termination had been agreed by all 6 members of 2PM and led to fan boycotts on 2PM-endorsed products. Protests for Park's return to the group began to take place, not only in South Korea, but internationally as well. Various Jay Park-dedicated forums and fansites all over the world organized silent protests and flash dance mobs. Fans also hired a plane with a banner showing [...] "J, <b>what</b> <b>time</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> now?" [...] to fly over Seattle, and was broadcast on Seattle-based radio stations.|$|E
