Stanley was the Cardinals' best run-stopper on defense, amassing 48tackles and 5.5sacks during the season.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage to}} the Arena Zytek led to the car being {{withdrawn}} during scrutineering a <b>week</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> later, just before the actual race. The team {{decided that it was}} not able to repair the damage in time for the car to pass scrutineering.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Robert Richardson was a <b>week</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> into {{shooting}} City of Hope for John Sayles when he {{got word}} that Stone was thinking about making JFK. By the time principal photography wrapped on City of Hope, Richardson was ready to make Stone's film. To prepare, Richardson read up on various JFK assassination books starting with On the Trail of the Assassins and Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy.|$|E

60|$|The Rough Riders left Cuba on August 7, {{just six}} <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> after landing. The {{time spent in}} the island had been short, but to many it seemed an age. None were sorry to depart, {{although}} sad to think that some of the sick had to be left behind.|$|R
60|$|I haven't {{piled up}} MS so in years as I have done since {{we came here}} to the farm three <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> ago. Why, it's like old times, to step right into the study, damp from the breakfast table, and sail right in and sail right on, the whole day long, without thought of running short of stuff or words.|$|R
5|$|On October 31, 2015, Harris {{returned}} to the Los Angeles D-Fenders for a third stint. He began the season as a finalist for performer of the week during the first <b>week</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> of the season. On December 14, he {{was traded to the}} Texas Legends in exchange for the returning player rights to Damion James. On January 26, 2016, he left Texas and signed with Türk Telekom for a second stint.|$|E
5|$|The team mostly lay {{low in the}} race's first <b>week</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> {{with only}} fourth in a sprint from Assan Bazayev in Stage 4 and fifth in Stage 6 by Maxim Iglinsky from a {{breakaway}} to show for themselves through nine stages. Contador and Klöden both showed strongly in the Stage 10 individual time trial, with Contador missing the stage win by just 8 seconds (Klöden was third, 20 seconds off Marzio Bruseghin's winning time) and moving from eighth to fourth in the overall classification.|$|E
5|$|U-37 sailed from Wilhelmshaven on 1 August, {{again with}} Victor Oehrn in command. This <b>week</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> long patrol in the Atlantic off {{the west coast}} of Ireland {{resulted}} in the sinking of a single British ship, Upwey Grange. U-37 returned to port on 12 August, but rather than head back to Wilhelmshaven, she made for Lorient in France, where the 2nd U-boat Flotilla was now based.|$|E
50|$|The {{switchover}} was bitterly {{opposed by}} {{much of the}} populace, who feared it was an attempt by landlords to cheat them out of <b>a</b> <b>week</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half's</b> rent. However, the Catholic countries of Spain, Portugal, Poland, and Italy complied. France, some states of the Dutch Republic and various Catholic states in Germany and Switzerland (both countries were religiously split) followed suit {{within a year or}} two, and Hungary followed in 1587.|$|R
60|$|Well, {{during two}} <b>weeks</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> we watched by the crib, {{and in our}} deep solicitude we were {{unconscious}} of any world outside of that sick-room. Then our reward came: {{the center of the}} universe turned the corner and began to mend. Grateful? It isn't the term. There isn't any term for it. You know that yourself, if you've watched your child through the Valley of the Shadow and seen it come back to life and sweep night out of the earth with one all-illuminating smile that you could cover with your hand.|$|R

5|$|Immediately after hatching, turtles are {{dependent}} on egg yolk material for sustenance. About a week to a <b>week</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> after emerging from their eggs (or the following spring if emergence is delayed), hatchlings begin feeding to support growth. The young turtles grow rapidly at first, sometimes doubling their size in the first year. Growth slows sharply at sexual maturity and may stop completely. Likely owing to differences of habitat and food by water body, growth rates often differ from population to population in the same area. Among the subspecies, the western painted turtles are the quickest growers.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, the Council of Ministers {{ordered that}} a small batch of jets from each OKB were {{to participate in the}} 7 November parade commemorating the October Revolution. Because of the tight deadline, the components for the two incomplete prototypes were turned over to Factory No. 301 at Khimki, the new headquarters for the Lavochkin OKB, for assembly by Factory No. 381. Factory No. 21 in Gorky joined the program with three more aircraft built in record time with support from Factory No. 301. Tooling was constructed in 5–10 days with the first aircraft completed in a <b>week</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b>|$|E
5|$|North Carolina rose to No. 7 in the {{national}} college football polls, and the victory over Indiana was followed the next week by a 2817 win over No. 17 Stanford University. The two season-opening wins were followed by six more in succession. The Tar Heels beat Maryland, 4014, on September 20, and Virginia on September 27 by a score of 4820. Prior to the win against Virginia, North Carolina, rose from No. 7 to No. 5 in the polls, and remained at that level after the win. Texas Christian University fell 3110 to the Tar Heels on October 4, and Wake Forest lost to North Carolina, 3012, on October 11. After a week of inactivity, in which the Tar Heels rose to No. 4, North Carolina defeated in-state rival NC State by a score of 207, and after another <b>week</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half,</b> the Tar Heels beat Georgia Tech narrowly, 1613, in a Thursday night game.|$|E

30|$|Victoria {{already had}} {{in place a}} strong {{universal}} service system. Central to this system was its {{maternal and child health}} services which were funded through a partnership arrangement between the State and Local Governments. Through the maternal and child health system, children aged between 1 <b>week</b> <b>and</b> three <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> years <b>and</b> their families attended ten visits with a highly trained maternal and child health nurse (DEECD, 2011). The maternal and child health system was effective in monitoring children’s health and development, and in providing referrals and advice to families when necessary if additional support was required (DEECD, 2011).|$|R

5|$|The Virgin release {{had been}} timed to {{coincide}} with the height of Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee celebrations. By Jubilee weekend, a <b>week</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> after the record's release, it had sold more than 150,000 copies—a massive success. On 7 June, McLaren and the record label arranged to charter a private boat and have the Sex Pistols perform while sailing down the River Thames, passing Westminster Pier and the Houses of Parliament. The event, a mockery of the Queen's river procession planned for two days later, ended in chaos. Police launches forced the boat to dock, and constabulary surrounded the gangplanks at the pier. While the band members and their equipment were hustled down a side stairwell, McLaren, Westwood, and many of the band's entourage were arrested.|$|E
5|$|The {{ash fall}} created some {{temporary}} major problems with transportation, sewage disposal, and water treatment systems. Visibility was greatly decreased during the ash fall, closing many highways and roads. Interstate 90 from Seattle to Spokane {{was closed for}} a <b>week</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b> Air travel was disrupted for between {{a few days and}} two weeks, as several airports in eastern Washington shut down because of ash accumulation and poor visibility. Over a thousand commercial flights were cancelled following airport closures. Fine-grained, gritty ash caused substantial problems for internal-combustion engines and other mechanical and electrical equipment. The ash contaminated oil systems and clogged air filters, and scratched moving surfaces. Fine ash caused short circuits in electrical transformers, which in turn caused power blackouts.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of September 1, {{hurricane}} warnings were issued for the northwest Bahamas while hurricane watches were issued for the lower east coast of Florida and tropical storm watches were issued for the Florida Keys. There was the potential for catastrophic damage along Florida's heavily populated east coast, with warnings that damages from Frances could exceed the insured losses of Hurricane Andrew. These damage estimates were in anticipation that Frances would strike Florida as a strong Category Four hurricane. Preparations for the storm were stepped up in Florida on September 1. Governor Jeb Bush {{declared a state of}} emergency, Kennedy Space Center closed down, and evacuations of 500,000people were initially ordered. Eventually 41 counties received evacuation orders, covering 2.8million residents, the largest evacuation in Florida's history. The state education system also responded to the pending crisis. Many universities across Florida canceled classes. Both the University of Central Florida and the University of North Florida told all students to leave their dorms. Evacuation at the University of South Florida was performed on a dorm-by-dorm basis. Florida Atlantic University was closed for a <b>week</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half.</b> Most schools were shut down from southern Miami-Dade County to just south of Melbourne two days before the hurricane. The annual Florida State University-University of Miami college football game was rescheduled for the following week.|$|E

5000|$|Pitt {{continued}} {{his search for}} a Parliamentary seat, being defeated in the selection for Cannock in 1971. He moved to the left during the period after 1970, and in spring 1972 he produced a 40,000 word policy statement for the Labour Party which was poorly received by senior spokesmen. Early in 1973 a strategy document written by Pitt was leaked to London evening newspapers; it included a pledge that public expenditure would rise rapidly but no-one earning less than £50 <b>a</b> <b>week</b> (one <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>half</b> times average industrial earnings) should have to pay increased taxes.|$|R
