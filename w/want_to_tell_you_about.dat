It is unbelievable, and it is wonderful. And such a lover! Such a curious, unusual, and quite {{altogether}} remarkable lover. In fact, I have laughed all the books and all biology in the face. I am a monogamist. I love the woman, the one woman. After a dozen years of possession I love her quite madly, oh, so sweetly madly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you mind}} if I take a little time?" [...] He stopped, casting about for the way to begin. [...] "I {{remember}} reading a story--Herbert Shaw wrote it, I think. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> it. There was a woman, young and beautiful; a man magnificent, a lover of beauty and a wanderer. I don't know how much like your Rex Strang he was, but I fancy a sort of resemblance. Well, this man was a painter, a bohemian, a vagabond. He kissed--oh, several times and for several weeks--and rode away. She possessed for him what I thought you possessed for me ... at Lake Geneva. In ten years she wept the beauty out of her face. Some women turn yellow, you know, when grief upsets their natural juices.|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR COLVIN,--I {{write to}} let you know that my cousin may {{possibly}} come to Paris before you leave; he will likely look you up to hear about me, etc. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> him before you see him, as I am tired of people misjudging him. You know me now. Well, Bob is just such another mutton, only somewhat farther wandered. He has all the same elements of character that I have: no two people were ever more alike, only that the world has gone more unfortunately for him although more evenly. Besides which, he is really a gentleman, and an admirable true friend, which is not a common article. I write this as a letter of introduction in case he should catch you ere you leave.|$|E
6000|$|... “There {{is another}} kind of playthings I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> a little, and then my lecture will be done. I mean playthings which give you pleasure, but give other persons pain. A drum and a whistle, for example, are disagreeable to other persons; and {{children}}, therefore, ought not to choose them, unless they {{have a place to}} go to, to play with them, which will be out of hearing. I have known boys to buy masks to frighten other children with, and bows and arrows, which sometimes are the means of putting out children’s eyes. So you must consider, when you are choosing playthings, first, whether the pleasure they will give you will be from the novelty or the use; and, secondly, whether, in giving you pleasure, they will give any other persons pain.|$|E

Upon the Budget and upon the policy of the Budget depends a {{far-reaching}} plan of social organisation designed to give a greater measure of security to all classes, but particularly to the labouring classes. In the centre of that plan stands the policy of national insurance. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has been {{for more than a year}} at work upon this scheme, and it is proposed--I hope next year, if there is a next year--it is proposed, working through the great friendly societies, which have done so much invaluable work on these lines, to make sure that, by the aid of a substantial subvention from the State, even the poorest steady worker or the poorest family shall be enabled to make provision against sickness, against invalidity, and for the widows and orphans who may be left behind.|$|E
