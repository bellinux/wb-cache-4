25|$|Gomez, a {{longtime}} journalist, recalls having met and interviewed Duke {{in the mid-1970s}} when Duke was a state senate candidate:He {{was still in his}} mid-20s and very non-descript. Tall and slimly built, he had a very prominent nose, flat cheek bones, a slightly receding chin and straight dark brown hair. The interview turned out to be quite innocuous, and I hadn't thought about it again until Duke came to my legislative desk, and <b>we</b> <b>shook</b> <b>hands.</b> Who was this guy? Tall and well-built with a perfect nose, a model's cheek bones, prominent chin, blue eyes and freshly coiffed blond hair, he looked like a movie star. He obviously didn't remember from the radio encounter, and I was content to leave it at that.Consistent with Gomez's observation, Duke in the latter 1980s reportedly had his nose thinned and chin augmented. Following his election to the Louisiana House of Representatives, he shaved his mustache.|$|E
500|$|Flo & Eddie (singers Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman) {{arrived at}} the end of {{recording}} time when the band thought all the tracks were finalised. When they learned of the vocal duo's purpose, [...] "they weren't really up for it," [...] said Kaylan: the two veterans [...] "represented establishment... e literally felt like, {{for the first time as}} session guys, we were proving ourselves". In the end, however, the band members warmed to the pair, and concluded a successful session. [...] "We did the three or four cuts that Todd had brought us up to do, and <b>we</b> <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> with everybody," [...] Kaylan recalled, but as they were preparing to leave, Rundgren asked them to listen to the album's planned single. After [...] "Love My Way" [...] played, Kaylan and Volman excitedly insisted that they be allowed to record some vocals for it. [...] "We have got to sing on this one," [...] Kaylan recalls thinking. [...] "If we don't sing on this one, we're not gonna sing on the hit. This is the fucking hit!" [...] The background vocals that Flo & Eddie ultimately contributed ended up being considered one of the highlights of their lengthy career.|$|E
500|$|In the 2013 {{video game}} , a prequel to the Arkham series, {{there are several}} {{references}} to The Killing Joke. When Batman enters a carnival-esque room, Joker tells him he got {{a great deal on}} an out-of-service amusement park, [...] "You should have seen the look on the real estate agent's face when <b>we</b> <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> on the deal!", alluding to Joker's conning a theme park entrepreneur into granting him the rights of a run-down amusement park early in the graphic novel and then proceeding to murder him via Joker toxin. In a level featuring a psychiatric interview with Dr. Harleen Quinzel, Joker is playable as the Red Hood, walking through the chemical plant that will end with him becoming the Joker, as well as earlier beating up several patrons at a Comedy Club due to very poor reception towards a joke he made. The name of the achievement for defeating the Joker in the ending of the game [...] "Perhaps sooner, perhaps later" [...] was a reference to Batman's talk with [...] "Joker" [...] {{in the beginning of the}} graphic novel. While promoting the game, Troy Baker, who voices the Joker in the game, recites a monologue from the graphic novel.|$|E

I won't {{say that}} {{appearances}} were against you at Brussels--I will only say I {{ought not to}} have trusted to appearances. You are the injured person; please forgive me. Shall we {{go on with the}} subject? or shall <b>we</b> <b>shake</b> <b>hands,</b> and say no more about it?" ...|$|R

I hope we part as friends, on two sides of the war barrier that {{separates}} us. Please remember that there is nothing personal about this," [...] he repeated. [...] "I respect your stand and wish you well. My duty lies elsewhere." [...] <b>We</b> <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> and I never saw him again.|$|E
2500|$|Shamrock {{engaged in}} a feud with Don Frye during {{his career in the}} Pride Fighting Championships, whose {{background}} was Don Frye's trash talking. In 1999, Alicia Webb (also known as Ryan Shamrock) dated Ken Shamrock until early 2003. Frye made comments to the effect that Shamrock cheated on and divorced his wife to date a young girl (Alicia Webb was 19 and Ken Shamrock was 35 when they started dating). Frye also joked that Ken's (at the time) estranged father Bob and brother Frank would be in Frye's corner for the fight. Ken Shamrock was enraged by Frye's trash talk, causing a feud between Shamrock and Frye. Since then, Frye has stated that he only resorted to personal trash talk to make Ken want to fight him. Frye said: [...] "I saw Ken Shamrock whoop him (Dan Severn) at UFC 6 and I thought, [...] "That's a guy I gotta fight. Anybody who can whoop Dan Severn like that has gotta be a man and I want to test my size against his size. I had the chance to talk trash and they gave me the fight; I crossed the line. I wasn't professional about it, but Ken was and after the fight, <b>we</b> <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> and went our separate ways." ...|$|E

5000|$|An {{interview}} in The Lawyer in 2003 painted Pearl as an [...] "old school" [...] businessman favouring a [...] "gentleman’s agreement" [...] over routine legal outsourcing. ‘"I have 27 joint venture partners and I don't have legal joint venture agreements {{with any of}} them," [...] he says. [...] "We buy properties together. <b>We</b> <b>shake</b> <b>hands,</b> do a deal and that's the way it is"’.|$|R
6000|$|MRS. DUBEDAT [coming to them] I {{felt that}} I must <b>shake</b> <b>hands</b> {{with his friends}} once before we part to-day. We have shared {{together}} a great privilege and a great happiness. I dont think we can ever think of ourselves ordinary people again. We have had a wonderful experience; and that gives us a common faith, a common ideal, that nobody else can quite have. Life will always be beautiful to us: death will always be beautiful to us. May <b>we</b> <b>shake</b> <b>hands</b> on that? ...|$|R
2500|$|Warrior {{had been}} largely alienated from his peers in {{professional}} wrestling in the decade before his death, and was sometimes described as a bitter man on bad terms with various wrestling figures such as Vince McMahon, Hulk Hogan and Jake Roberts. With Warrior's reconciling with the professional wrestling industry just before his death, some of his former adversaries offered their condolences. McMahon stated that [...] "We are all so sad that the Ultimate Warrior has passed away. Our heart is with his wife Dana and his two daughters." [...] Hogan said, [...] "RIP WARRIOR. only love ... We talked, both forgave each other, we hugged, <b>we</b> <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> as we told each other I love you, I am so sad, God bless his beautiful family". Roberts {{said that he was}} [...] "Deeply saddened. We just had a great talk & buried a senseless hatchet. Talked working together. RIP Warrior. Taking solace we made peace." [...] News of his death spread the next day on sites such as Bing, Facebook, and Twitter. It was also mentioned on ABC News, HLN and CNN. Reportedly almost immediately after Warrior's death, WWE sent two senior officials to Arizona to assist his widow in handling personal things such as grocery shopping so that she can focus on being with her and Warrior's daughters.|$|E
2500|$|... “One day Colonel Cody {{sent for}} me to come to his private office. [...] Wondering what he would want of me, I knocked at his door. [...] He invited me in, remarking, ‘Sit down, Standing Bear. [...] I have sent for you because I want you to tell you {{something}} of importance. [...] The Big Chief of this country, the King of England, has promised to attend a performance of our show. [...] Now I want you to go back to your people, call them all together, and tell them all about it. [...] Tell them {{to be very careful about}} their clothes; to see that they are perfectly clean and neat for that particular performance. [...] If anything needs repairs, tell them to attend to it at once. [...] We must please the King at this performance. [...] Rehearse your Indians well so they will do their best for me. [...] If the King likes our show, it will please the people of this country. [...] I have observed your own costume. [...] It is very fine, and when the King attends the show, I want you to do an Indian dance in front of his box. [...] Will you do this for me?” [...] “Everything worked splendidly. [...] When it came time for the Indians to come in with their village in the center of the arena, we started the dance in which I was to appear before the King of England. [...] I had a beautiful lance, and as the dance proceeded I worked over toward the King’s box. [...] There I shook the lance in his face and danced my very prettiest, you may be sure. [...] The King had been very dignified thus far, and had not even smiled. [...] But when I got down to doing my fancy steps and gave a few Sioux yells, he had to smile in spite of himself. [...] I saw that I had made a hit with him and was very happy. After the show, Buffalo Bill brought the King and his party around the inside of the arena. [...] In front of him walked a big man who seemed to keep his eyes roving about all the while. [...] I think he must have been the King’s personal bodyguard. [...] Buffalo Bill brought the King over to me and we were introduced. [...] <b>We</b> <b>shook</b> <b>hands,</b> although neither of us said a word. [...] But I had the honor of being introduced to King Edward VII, the monarch of Great Britain.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] he answered, [...] "our paths lie apart henceforth, Macumazahn. We met {{together}} for certain ends. Those ends are fulfilled. Now each one goes his own way. You have still {{many years before}} you, Macumazahn; my years are few. When <b>we</b> <b>shake</b> <b>hands</b> here {{it will be for}} the last time.

6000|$|... "Mr. Hartright?" [...] {{said the}} lady interrogatively, her dark face {{lighting}} {{up with a}} smile, and softening and growing womanly the moment she began to speak. [...] "We resigned all hope of you last night, {{and went to bed}} as usual. Accept my apologies for our apparent want of attention; and allow me to introduce myself as one of your pupils. Shall <b>we</b> <b>shake</b> <b>hands?</b> I suppose <b>we</b> must come to it sooner or later--and why not sooner?" ...|$|R
60|$|I promised, {{but without}} much alacrity. <b>We</b> <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> and the {{carriage}} drove off.|$|E
60|$|I {{thanked him}} for his {{improved}} opinion, and as we entered the restaurant <b>we</b> <b>shook</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|E

60|$|LORD SUMMERHAYS. Well, I really hadnt {{time to be}} a father: {{thats the}} plain truth of the matter. Their poor dear mother did the usual thing while they were with us. Then of course, Harrow, Cambridge, the usual routine of their class. I saw very little of them, and thought very little about them: how could I? with a whole {{province}} on my hands. They and I are--acquaintances. Not perhaps, quite ordinary acquaintances: theres a sort of--er--I should almost call it a sort of remorse about the way <b>we</b> <b>shake</b> <b>hands</b> (when <b>we</b> do <b>shake</b> <b>hands)</b> which means, I suppose, that we're sorry we dont care more for one another; and I'm afraid we dont meet oftener than we can help. We put each other too much out of countenance. It's really a very difficult relation. To my mind not altogether a natural one.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> all <b>shook</b> <b>hands</b> and sat down. Then Phil and I {{told our}} stories {{straight}} to the finish, and I also produced the letters I had taken from the locker in Captain Hannock's stateroom.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>shook</b> <b>hands,</b> {{and he was}} so earnest and so {{kind that}} it made me quite choky.|$|E

60|$|So then <b>we</b> all <b>shook</b> <b>hands,</b> and Miss Malloy left us. Me and Buck also rose up and sauntered off a {{few hundred}} miles; for we didn't care to be around when them {{marriage}} certificates fell due.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> all <b>shook</b> <b>hands,</b> and the policeman, having {{retrieved}} a {{piece of}} chewing-gum from the underside of a chair, where he had parked it against a rainy day, went off into a corner and began to contemplate the infinite.|$|R
