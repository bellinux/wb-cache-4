40|$|SummarySymptoms {{of heart}} failure {{can be caused by}} the diastolic {{dysfunction}} even in patients with normal ejection fraction, and this condition has been called diastolic heart failure. After Kitabatake and his associates first used echo-Doppler to characterize the transmitral flow velocity in various disease states in 1982, there have been remarkable advances in the evaluation of diastolic function <b>with</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>echocardiography.</b> Types of diastolic dysfunction can be classified into relaxation abnormality, pseudonormal, reversible restrictive physiology, and irreversible restrictive physiology. Classifying the patients into these types, in addition to the reliable estimation of left ventricular filling pressure <b>with</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>echocardiography,</b> enables us to adjust treatment in individual patients and to get information about the prognosis. The main hemodynamic abnormality in patients with diastolic dysfunction is the abnormal filling function of the heart. Therefore, if we expand the scope of diastolic heart failure, patients with constrictive pericarditis can also be categorized into diastolic heart failure. The purpose of this review is to refine our knowledge in the concept of diastolic dysfunction and to update the methods used in its’ evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Background—Pulmonary {{hypertension}} {{has been}} suggested {{to play an important}} role in development of high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE), and individual susceptibility {{has been suggested}} to be associated with enhanced pulmonary vascular response to hypoxia. We hypothesized that much greater pulmonary vasoconstriction would be induced by acute alveolar hypoxia in HAPE-susceptible (HAPE-s) subjects and that changes in pulmonary blood flow distribution could be demonstrated by radionuclide study. Methods and Results—We performed ventilation-perfusion scintigraphy in 8 HAPE-s subjects and 5 control subjects while each was in the supine position and acquired functional images of pulmonary blood flow and ventilation under separate normoxic and hypoxic (arterial oxygen saturation, 70 %) conditions. We also measured acceleration time/right ventricular ejection time (AcT/RVET) <b>with</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>echocardiography</b> under each condition in both groups. Moreover, we assayed human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles serologically in the HAPE-s group. Pulmonary blood flow was significantly shifted from the basal lung region to the apical lung region under hypoxia in HAPE-s subjects, although no significant change in regional ventilation was observed. <b>With</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>echocardiography,</b> HAPE-s subjects showed increased pulmonary arterial pressure during hypoxia compared with control subjects. The magnitude of cephalad redistribution of lung blood flow was significantly higher in the HLA-DR 6 –positive than in HLA-DR 6 –negative HAPE-s subjects...|$|E

40|$|Cross {{sectional}} echocardiography combined <b>with</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>echocardiography</b> {{was used}} to record either ductal morphology or the flow profile within the ductus arteriosus before and after infusion of prostaglandin E 1 in 25 newborn infants with cyanotic and acyanotic congenital heart disease with ductus dependent blood flow. The ultrasound results were compared with changes in arterial oxygen tension and the overall clinical response to prostaglandin E 1 seen {{during the same period}} in 24 of the 25 patients in whom the degree of ductal narrowing could be determined with the ultrasound method. At the time of the study, the ductus was widely patent or slightly narrowed in 12 patients and was closed in two patients. These patients did not respond to prostaglandin E 1. There was prominent localised narrowing of the ductus in seven patients and generalised narrowing in three. After the infusion of prostaglandin E 1 there was no ductal narrowing in these patients, except for one patient who had slight residual localised narrowing. There was also a considerable change in the ductal flow profiles in each patient. In these 10 patients infusion of prostaglandin E 1 resulted in an increase in arterial oxygen tension, clinical improvement, or both. The present study indicates that prostaglandin E 1 is effective in patients with prominent narrowing of the ductus but is not in patients in whom the ductus is widely patent or closed.

40|$|This {{investigation}} {{was performed to}} determine whether variables obtained directly from the Doppler left ventricular diastolic flow velocity profile provide a reliable estimate of diastolic function. Measurements of diastolic flow velocity obtained by Doppler echocardiography were compared with volumetric measurements of left ventricular diastolic filling determined by radionuclide angiography in 12 subjects without cardiac disease and in 25 patients {{with a variety of}} cardiac diseases. The two methods were in agreement in distinguishing normal from abnormal diastolic function in 21 (84 %) of the 25 patients with cardiac disease, identifying diastolic function as normal in 8 and abnormal in 13 of these patients. Good correlations were observed between certain Doppler variables of left ventricular diastolic flow velocity and radionuclide angiographic variables of left ventricular filling. The time interval from the aortic closing component of the second heart sound {{to the end of the}} early diastolic flow velocity peak, assessed <b>with</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>echocardiography,</b> correlated well with the time interval from end-systole to the end of rapid filling, assessed with radionuclide angiography (r = 0. 83). Descent of the Doppler early diastolic flow velocity peak correlated well with the radionuclide angiographic peak filling rate (r = 0. 79). The ratio between the heights of the early and late (due to atrial systole) peaks of diastolic flow velocity showed good correlation with the ratio between percent of left ventricular filling during rapid filling and during atrial systole (r = 0. 76). These findings demonstrate that the left ventricular diastolic flow velocity profile obtained <b>with</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>echocardiography</b> compares favorably with radionuclide angiographic variables in the evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function. Therefore, indexes directly derived from the Doppler diastolic flow velocity waveform maybe useful in providing a noninvasive, reliable and easily obtained estimate of diastolic performance in patients with cardiac disease...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The true {{incidence}} of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTPH) remains {{a matter of}} debate. Symptomatic CTPH is probably more common than previously reported, whereas the occurrence of asymptomatic CTPH has not been defined since very limited evidence on the {{incidence of}} asymptomatic CTPH diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>echocardiography</b> <b>Doppler</b> are currently available. We therefore carried out a prospective cohort study to assess the incidence of CTPH diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>echocardiography</b> <b>Doppler</b> in consecutive patients with a first episode of PE. Methods: Consecutive patients with a first episode of PE were evaluated <b>with</b> <b>Doppler</b> transthoracic <b>echocardiography</b> within 6 to 12  months after the index event. Pulmonary {{hypertension was defined as}} a systolic pulmonary artery pressure ≥ 40  mmHg at rest in the presence of residual perfusion defects at perfusion scintigraphy. Presence of symptoms related to pulmonary hypertension was evaluated with a standardized questionnaire. Results: Ninety-one patients (mean age 61. 9 ± 15. 7  years; range 22 - 89; 39 men) were enrolled. Eight patients (8. 8 %; 95 % CI 4. 5, 16. 4) had CTPH: of these, 4 (4. 4 %; 95 % CI 2. 0, 9. 3) were symptomatic. Conclusions: Asymptomatic CTPH is not an uncommon finding after PE.

It has been observed that ptients with constrictive pericarditis have a characteristic Doppler pattern of respiratory variation in ventricular filling and central venous flow velocities. However, the observation was based on a small number of patients with known diagnosis. Methods. We reviewed the echocardiographic features of 28 patients (21 mem and 7 women; mean age ± SD 55 ± 15 years) with suspected constrictive pericarditis who underwent exploratory thoracotomy or pericardiectomy. Results. At operation, constrictive pericarditis was diagnosed in 25 patients, restriction in 1 and normal pericardium in 2. Of the 25 patients with constriction, correct preoperative Doppler diagnosis was made in 22 (88 %) and <b>Doppler</b> <b>echocardiography</b> showed restriction in 3. In two patients with a normal pericardium, Doppler features were consistent with constriction in one patient and were normal in the other.

40|$|The {{interest}} {{in the study of}} ventricular function has grown considerably in the last decades. In this review, we analyse the extreme values of ventricular function as obtained <b>with</b> <b>Doppler</b> <b>echocardiography.</b> We mainly focus on the parameters that have been used throughout the history of Doppler echocardiography to assess left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic function. The ‘athlete's heart’ would be the highest expression of ventricular function whereas its lowest expression is represented by the failing heart, independently from the original aetiology leading to this condition. There are, however, morphological similarities (dilation and hypertrophy) between the athlete's and the failing heart, which emerge as physiological and pathophysiological adaptations, respectively. The introduction of new assessment techniques, specifically speckle tracking, may provide new insight into the properties that determine ventricular filling, specifically left ventricular twisting.

40|$|Objective- To {{identify}} the left inferior pulmonary vein as an indirect marker of increased pulmonary flow in congenital heart diseases. Methods- We {{carried out a}} prospective consecutive study on 40 patients divided into 2 groups as follows: G 1 - 20 patients diagnosed with congenital heart disease and increased pulmonary flow; G 2 (control group) - 20 patients who were either healthy or had congenital heart disease with decreased or normal pulmonary flow. We obtained the velocity-time integral of the left inferior pulmonary vein flow, excluding the “reverse A ” wave, <b>with</b> pulsed <b>Doppler</b> <b>echocardiography.</b> Results- In G 1, 19 out of the 20 patients had wellidentified dilation of the left inferior pulmonary vein. No G 2 patient had dilation of the left inferior pulmonary vein. Dilation of the left inferior pulmonary vein in conditions of increased pulmonary flow had sensitivity of 95 %, specificity of 100 %, positive predictive value of 100 %, and negative predictive value of 95 % (1 false-negative case). The integral of time and velocity of the pulmonary venous flow obtained <b>with</b> pulsed <b>Doppler</b> <b>echocardiography</b> was greater in the G 1 patients (G 1 = 25. 0 ± 4. 6 cm versus G 2 = 14. 8 ± 2. 1 cm, p= 0. 0001). Conclusion- The identification of dilation of the left inferior pulmonary vein suggests the presence of congenital heart disease with increased pulmonary flow. This {{may be used as}} an indirect sign of increased flow, mainly in malformations of difficult diagnosis, such as atrial septal defects of the venous sinus or coronary sinus type.

40|$|Background: Previous studies {{indicate}} that compared <b>with</b> physical examination, <b>Doppler</b> <b>echocardiography</b> identifies {{a larger number of}} cases of rheumatic heart disease in apparently healthy individuals. Objectives: To determine the prevalence of rheumatic heart disease among students in a public school of Belo Horizonte by clinical evaluation and <b>Doppler</b> <b>echocardiography.</b> Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted with 267 randomly selected school students aged between 6 and 16 years. students underwent anamnesis and physical examination with the purpose of establishing criteria for the diagnosis of rheumatic fever. They were all subjected to <b>Doppler</b> <b>echocardiography</b> using a portable machine. Those who exhibited nonphysiological mitral regurgitation (MR) and/or aortic regurgitation (AoR) were referred to the <b>Doppler</b> <b>echocardiography</b> laboratory of the Hospital das Clínicas of the Universidade Federal of Minas Gerais (HC-UFMG) to undergo a second <b>Doppler</b> <b>echocardiography</b> examination. According to the findings, the cases of rheumatic heart disease were classified as definitive, probable, or possible. Results: Of the 267 students, 1 (0. 37 %) had a clinical history compatible with the diagnosis of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and portable <b>Doppler</b> <b>echocardiography</b> indicated nonphysiological MR and/or AoR in 25 (9. 4 %). Of these, 16 (6 %) underwent <b>Doppler</b> <b>echocardiography</b> at HC-UFMG. The results showed definitive rheumatic heart disease in...|$|R
40|$|A neonate with {{a double}} {{aneuploidy}} associ-ated with congenital heart defect (CHD) suffered from cyanosis after birth. He had typical features of Down syndrome (DS) including hypertelorism, slightly lowset ears <b>with</b> protruding pinna. <b>Doppler</b> <b>echocardiography</b> indicated complex congenital heart disease with an ostium secundum atrial septal defect, enlarged right ventricle, and mild tricuspid valve re-gurgitation. Further chromosomal analysis showed a karyotype of 48,XXY,+ 21 : a double aneuploidy of DS and Klinefelter syndrome (KS). Until now, only seven cases of double aneuploidy associated with CHD defect have been reported...|$|R
