It remains customary for Indian Hindu <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> age to wear a nose stud, usually in the left nostril, due to the nostril's association with the female reproductive organs in Ayurvedic medicine. This piercing is sometimes done the night before the woman marries.|$|E
5|$|As of 2000, {{the median}} intake of iodine from {{food in the}} United States was 240 to 300μg/day for men and 190 to 210μg/day for women. The general US {{population}} has adequate iodine nutrition, with <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> age and pregnant women having a possible mild risk of deficiency. In Japan, consumption was considered much higher, ranging between 5,280μg/day to 13,800μg/day from dietary seaweed or kombu kelp, often {{in the form of}} Kombu Umami extracts for soup stock and potato chips. However, new studies suggest that Japan's consumption is closer to 1,000–3,000μg/day. The adult UL in Japan was last revised to 3,000µg/day in 2015.|$|E
5|$|As of 2012, 57% of <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> age want {{to avoid}} {{pregnancy}} (867 of 1520million). About 222 million women however {{were not able to}} access birth control, 53million of whom were in sub-Saharan Africa and 97million of whom were in Asia. This results in 54million unplanned pregnancies and nearly 80,000 maternal deaths a year. Part of the reason that many women are without birth control is that many countries limit access due to religious or political reasons, while another contributor is poverty. Due to restrictive abortion laws in Sub-Saharan Africa, many women turn to unlicensed abortion providers for unintended pregnancy, resulting in about 2–4% obtaining unsafe abortions each year.|$|E

5|$|While less {{used in the}} {{developed}} countries than the developing world, the number of women using IUDs as of 2007 was more than 180million. Avoiding sex when fertile is used by about 3.6% of <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> age, with usage as high as 20% in areas of South America. As of 2005, 12% of couples are using a male form of birth control (either condoms or a vasectomy) with higher rates in {{the developed}} world. Usage of male forms of birth control has decreased between 1985 and 2009. Contraceptive use among women in Sub-Saharan Africa has risen from about 5% in 1991 to about 30% in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The {{disease is}} caused by {{bacteria}} that spread from the vagina and cervix. Infections by Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis are present in 75 to 90 percent of cases. Often multiple different bacteria are involved. Without treatment about 10 percent of those with a chlamydial infection and 40 percent of those with a gonorrhea infection will develop PID. Risk factors {{are similar to those}} of sexually transmitted infections generally and include a high number of sexual partners and drug use. Vaginal douching may also increase the risk. The diagnosis is typically based on the presenting signs and symptoms. It is recommended that the disease be considered in all <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> age who have lower abdominal pain. A definitive diagnosis of PID is made by finding pus involving the fallopian tubes during surgery. Ultrasound may also be useful in diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Topical {{antibiotics}} deemed safe {{during pregnancy}} include clindamycin, erythromycin, and metronidazole (all category B), due to negligible systemic absorption. Nadifloxacin and dapsone (category C) are other topical antibiotics {{that may be}} used to treat acne in pregnant women, but have received less study. No adverse fetal events have been reported from the topical use of dapsone. If retinoids are used there is a high risk of abnormalities occurring in the developing fetus; <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> age are therefore required to use effective birth control if retinoids are used to treat acne. Oral antibiotics deemed safe for pregnancy (all category B) include azithromycin, cephalosporins, and penicillins. Tetracyclines (category D) are contraindicated during pregnancy as they are known to deposit in developing fetal teeth, resulting in yellow discoloration and thinned tooth enamel. Their use during pregnancy has been associated with development of acute fatty liver of pregnancy and is further avoided for this reason.|$|E

5|$|Isotretinoin is an oral retinoid {{that is very}} {{effective}} for severe nodular acne, and moderate acne that is stubborn to other treatments. One to two months use is typically adequate to see improvement. Acne often resolves completely or is much milder after a 4–6month course of oral isotretinoin. After a single course, about 80% of people report an improvement, with more than 50% reporting complete remission. About 20% of patients require a second course. Although concerns have emerged that isotretinoin use is linked with {{an increased risk of}} adverse effects, like depression, suicidality, anemia, although there is no clear evidence to support some of these claims. Isotretinoin use in <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> age is regulated due to its known harmful effects in pregnancy. For such a woman to be considered a candidate for isotretinoin, she must have a confirmed negative pregnancy test and use an effective form of birth control. In 2008, the United States started the iPLEDGE program to prevent isotretinoin use during pregnancy. iPledge requires the woman under consideration for isotretinoin therapy to have two negative pregnancy tests and mandates the use of two types of birth control for at least one month before therapy begins and one month after therapy is complete. The effectiveness of the iPledge program has been questioned due to continued instances of contraception nonadherence.|$|E

25|$|Sociobiologists and {{evolutionary}} psychologists have hypothesized that causing pregnancy by rape {{may be a}} mating strategy in humans, {{as a way for}} males to ensure the survival of their genes by passing them on to future generations. Randy Thornhill and Craig T. Palmer are key popularizers of this hypothesis. They assert that most rape victims are <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> age and that many cultures treat rape as a crime against the victim's husband. They state that rape victims suffer less emotional distress when they are subjected to more violence, and that married women and <b>women</b> <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> age experience greater psychological distress after a rape than do girls, single women or post-menopausal women. Rape-pregnancy rates are crucial in evaluating these theories, because a high or low pregnancy rate from rape would determine whether such adaptations are favored or disfavored by natural selection.|$|E

40|$|AbstractINTRODUCTIONRenal vein thrombosis, a rare {{complication}} of renal transplantation, often causes graft loss. Diagnosis includes ultrasound with Doppler, {{and it is}} often treated with anticoagulation or mechanical thrombectomy. Success is improved with early diagnosis and institution of treatment. PRESENTATION OF CASEWe report here {{the case of a}} 29 year-old female with sudden development of very late-onset renal vein thrombosis after simultaneous kidney pancreas transplant. This resolved initially with thrombectomy, stenting and anticoagulation, but thrombosis recurred, necessitating operative intervention. Intraoperatively the renal vein was discovered to be compressed by a large ovarian cyst. DISCUSSIONCompression of the renal vein by a lymphocele or hematoma is a known cause of thrombosis, {{but this is the first}} documented case of compression and thrombosis due to an ovarian cyst. CONCLUSIONEarly detection and treatment of renal vein thrombosis is paramount to restoring renal allograft function. Any <b>woman</b> <b>of</b> <b>childbearing</b> age may have thrombosis due to compression by an ovarian cyst, and screening for this possibility may improve long-term graft function in this population...|$|R
