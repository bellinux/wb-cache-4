25|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{the problem}} became {{increasingly}} popular in scientific circles in Europe and the USA after the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica offered prizes for steps {{in solving the}} problem. Notable contributions were made by George Dantzig, Delbert Ray Fulkerson and Selmer M. Johnson from the RAND Corporation, who expressed the problem as an integer linear program and developed the cutting plane method for its solution. They wrote what is considered the seminal paper on the subject in which with these new methods they solved an instance with 49 cities to optimality by constructing a tour and proving that no other tour could be shorter. Dantzig, Fulkerson and Johnson, however, speculated that given a near optimal solution <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> able to find optimality or prove optimality by adding {{a small amount of}} extra inequalities (cuts). They used this idea to solve their initial 49 city problem using a string model. They found they only needed 26 cuts to come to a solution for their 49 city problem. While this paper did not give an algorithmic approach to TSP problems, the ideas that lay within it were indispensable to later creating exact solution methods for the TSP, though it would take 15 years to find an algorithmic approach in creating these cuts. As well as cutting plane methods, Dantzig, Fulkerson and Johnson used branch and bound algorithms perhaps for the first time.|$|E

500|$|The film {{takes place}} {{simultaneously}} with {{the events of}} Iron Man 2 and Thor, the former of which is set {{six months after the}} events Iron Man. Downey briefly reprised his role from Iron Man as Tony Stark in a cameo appearance {{at the end of the}} film. Downey said that the filmmakers [...] "were just cross-pollinating our superheroes. It happens to be a scene where I basically approach , and <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> considering going into some sort of limited partnership together. The great thing is he—and I don't want to give too much away—but he's in disrepair at the time I find him. It was really fun seeing him play this really powerful character who's half in the bag."

Years later Morrissey considered the song to be the group's [...] "most special."

500|$|Tamworth started 2009–10 in good form, and by late September 2009 were {{occupying a}} {{play-off}} {{spot in the}} Conference Premier. Mills' team eventually finished in 16th place in a season of consolidation; this represented the second highest league placing in the club's history. He made the last appearance of his career aged 48 after starting Tamworth's 4–3 home defeat to Ebbsfleet United on 24 April 2010, before substituting himself for Des Lyttle in the 55th minute. This was his third appearance of the season. In the Conference Premier, Tamworth were playing against a number of clubs with Football League pedigrees, meaning {{they were not able}} to offer contracts as lucrative or long as many clubs. Mills complemented the competitiveness of his team in this division, saying: [...] "For a small club like us, it's great to be mixing with these teams. But, while <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> smaller, like last year, we will make sure that we are capable of getting results." [...] Tamworth had a strong start in 2010–11; they were again in a play-off position by late September 2010, and by the time Mills had left the club they were 12th in the Conference Premier.|$|E
500|$|Critics also approvingly {{compared}} it to Mariah Carey's modern Christmas classic [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] (1994), a track that RCA chief executive Peter Edge described as the song's inspiration. Williot added that [...] "Underneath the Tree" [...] is strong enough that it could enter the pantheon of modern Christmas staples like Carey's [...] "All I Want For Christmas Is You" [...] and 'N Sync's [...] "Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays". Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV News remarked, [...] "if <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> so bold, it is definitely on par with other impeccable Christmas originals—namely Carey's [...] "All I Want For Christmas Is You"." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted the similar themes of two songs, and that [...] "Underneath the Tree" [...] {{is likely to become}} Clarkson's very own contemporary standard. Melinda Newman of HitFix wrote, [...] "It's a finger-popping, bell-ringing pleaser that could achieve that rare feat of becoming a new Christmas standard. That hasn't happened since Carey's [...] "All I Want For Christmas" [...] in 1994;" [...] while The Independents Hugh Montgomery applauded it as having a sass, jingle and a sax solo, saying that it is [...] "a winner on all fronts." ...|$|E
500|$|The London Quarterly Review {{began with}} the {{observation}} that [...] "When an intelligent man tells us that he has spent eleven of {{the best years of}} his life in any district, <b>we</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> pretty sure he has something to say about it which will interest even those who generally find travels dull reading". The reviewer finds Bates among the most readable, and free of the usual [...] "personal twaddle" [...] of travel and adventure books. The reviewer also remarks on Bates's subtitle [...] "...of the origin of species", that Wallace had taken up that theme more fully. In the reviewer's opinion, Bates says little about [...] "the Darwinian hypothesis", focusing instead steadily on natural history, while making [...] "very shrewd remarks" [...] about human society and giving [...] "most glowing" [...] descriptions of tropical scenery. The reviewer notes {{that most of the people}} Bates meets [...] "had a tinge of colour" [...] but made the [...] "lonely Englishman" [...] comfortable with their [...] "winning cordiality", and is amused that in a feast in Ega an Indian dressed up as an entomologist, complete with insect-net, hunting-bag, pincushion, and an old pair of spectacles. As for nature, the reviewer considers that [...] "in Brazil man is oppressed, crushed, by the immensity of nature".|$|E
