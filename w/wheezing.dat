5|$|Asthma is {{a common}} {{long-term}} inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs. It is characterized by variable and recurring symptoms, reversible airflow obstruction, and bronchospasm. Symptoms include episodes of <b>wheezing,</b> coughing, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. These episodes may occur {{a few times a}} day or a few times per week. Depending on the person, they may become worse at night or with exercise.|$|E
5|$|If {{granulation}} tissue grows over the injured site, {{it can cause}} stenosis of the airway, after a week to a month. The {{granulation tissue}} must be surgically excised. Delayed diagnosis of a bronchial rupture increases risk of infection and lengthens hospital stay. People with a narrowed airway may suffer dyspnea, coughing, <b>wheezing,</b> respiratory tract infection, and difficulty with clearing secretions. If the bronchiole is completely obstructed, atelectasis occurs: the alveoli of the lung collapse. Lung tissue distal to a completely obstructed bronchiole often does not become infected. Because {{it is filled with}} mucus, this tissue remains functional. When the secretions are removed, the affected portion of the lung is commonly able to function almost normally. However, infection is common in lungs distal to a partially obstructed bronchiole. Infected lung tissue distal to a stricture can be damaged, and <b>wheezing</b> and coughing may develop due to the narrowing. In addition to pneumonia, the stenosis may cause bronchiectasis, in which bronchi are dilated, to develop. Even after an airway with a stricture is restored to normal, the resulting loss of lung function may be permanent.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Automatic <b>wheeze</b> {{detection}} {{has several}} potential benefits compared to reliance on human auscultation: it is experience-independent, an automated historical record {{can easily be}} kept and it allows quantification of <b>wheeze</b> severity. Previous attempts to detect <b>wheezes</b> automatically have had partial success, but have not been reliable enough to become widely accepted as a useful tool. In this paper an improved algorithm for automatic <b>wheeze</b> detection based on auditory modelling is developed, called the frequency and duration dependent threshold or fddt algorithm. Parameters of mean frequency and duration of each <b>wheeze</b> component are obtained automatically. The detected <b>wheezes</b> are marked on a spectrogram. In the new algorithm, {{the concept of a}} frequency and duration dependent threshold for <b>wheeze</b> detection is introduced. Another departure from previous work is that the threshold is based not on global power, but on power corresponding to a particular frequency range. The algorithm has been tested on 36 subjects, 11 of whom exhibited characteristics of <b>wheeze.</b> The results show a marked improvement in the accuracy of <b>wheeze</b> detection when compared with previous algorithms.

40|$|International audienceRationale There is {{evidence}} that perinatal lung development predicts childhood <b>wheeze.</b> However, very {{few studies have examined}} whether preschool <b>wheeze</b> is associated with lower premorbid lung function in early infancy, and as yet there is no information relating atopic and non-atopic preschool <b>wheeze</b> to early lung development. Objective To examine the association between premorbid infant lung function and preschool <b>wheeze,</b> and to explore associations with atopic and non-atopic <b>wheeze</b> phenotypes. Methods Infant lung function was measured in 147 healthy term infants aged 5 - 14 weeks. Rapid thoracoabdominal compression was performed during tidal breathing and at raised volume to measure maximal expiratory flow at functional residual capacity (V'maxFRC) and forced expiratory volume in 0. 4 sec (FEV 0. 4). Atopic status was determined by skin prick testing at 3 years and <b>wheeze</b> ascertained from parental questionnaires (1 and 3 years). Measurements and Main Results Lower early infancy V'maxFRC was associated with <b>wheeze</b> in both the first and third years of life (p= 0. 002 and p= 0. 006, respectively). Lower early infancy FEV 0. 4 was associated with <b>wheeze</b> in the first year (p= 0. 03). Compared to non-atopic children who did not <b>wheeze,</b> non-atopic children who <b>wheezed</b> in their third year of life had lower FEV 0. 4, (p= 0. 02), whilst FEV 0. 4 values of atopic children who <b>wheezed</b> were not significantly different (p= 0. 4). Conclusions Lower premorbid infant lung function was present in infants who subsequently <b>wheezed</b> during the first and third years of life. Lower FEV 0. 4 in early infancy was associated with non-atopic <b>wheeze</b> but not atopic <b>wheeze</b> at 3 years of age...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Among {{children}} with <b>wheeze</b> and recurrent cough {{there is great}} variation in clinical presentation and time course of the disease. We previously distinguished 5 phenotypes of <b>wheeze</b> and cough in early childhood by applying latent class analysis to longitudinal data from a population-based cohort (original cohort). OBJECTIVE To validate previously identified phenotypes of childhood cough and <b>wheeze</b> in an independent cohort. METHODS We included 903 children reporting <b>wheeze</b> or recurrent cough from an independent population-based cohort (validation cohort). As in the original cohort, we used latent class analysis to identify phenotypes {{on the basis of}} symptoms of <b>wheeze</b> and cough at 2 time points (preschool and school age) and objective measurements of atopy, lung function, and airway responsiveness (school age). Prognostic outcomes (<b>wheeze,</b> bronchodilator use, cough apart from colds) 5 years later were compared across phenotypes. RESULTS When using a 5 -phenotype model, the analysis distinguished 3 phenotypes of <b>wheeze</b> and 2 of cough as in the original cohort. Two phenotypes were closely similar in both cohorts: Atopic persistent <b>wheeze</b> (persistent multiple trigger <b>wheeze</b> and chronic cough, atopy and reduced lung function, poor prognosis) and transient viral <b>wheeze</b> (early-onset transient <b>wheeze</b> with viral triggers, favorable prognosis). The other phenotypes differed more between cohorts. These differences might be explained by differences in age at measurements. CONCLUSIONS Applying the same method to 2 different cohorts, we consistently identified 2 phenotypes of <b>wheeze</b> (atopic persistent <b>wheeze,</b> transient viral <b>wheeze),</b> suggesting that these represent distinct disease processes. Differences found in other phenotypes suggest that the age when features are assessed is critical and should be considered carefully when defining phenotypes...|$|R

40|$|Background: A {{recently}} proposed {{method for}} classifying preschool <b>wheeze</b> {{is to describe}} it as either episodic (viral) <b>wheeze</b> or multiple trigger <b>wheeze.</b> In research studies, phenotype is generally determined by retrospective questionnaire. Aim: To determine whether recently proposed phenotypes of preschool <b>wheeze</b> are stable over time. Methods: In all, 132 two to six-year-old children with doctor diagnosed asthma on maintenance inhaled corticosteroids were classified as having episodic (viral) <b>wheeze</b> or multiple trigger <b>wheeze</b> at a screening visit and then followed up at three-monthly intervals for a year. At each follow-up visit, standardized questionnaires {{were used to determine}} whether the subjects <b>wheezed</b> only with, or also in the absence of colds.

Results: Phenotype as determined by retrospective parental report at the start of the study was not predictive of phenotype during the study year. Phenotypic classification remained the same in 45. 9 % of children and altered in 54. 1 % of children.

5|$|Despite {{its size}} and gaudy coloration, this vulture is quite {{inconspicuous}} when it is perched in trees. While perched, it holds its head lowered and thrust forward. It is non-migratory and, unlike the turkey, lesser yellow-headed and American black vulture, it generally lives alone or in small family groups. Groups of up to 12 birds have been observed bathing and drinking in a pool above a waterfall in Belize. One or two birds generally descend to feed at a carcass, although occasionally up to ten or so may gather if there is significant amount of food. King vultures have lived up to 30 years in captivity, though their lifespan in the wild is unknown. This vulture uses urohidrosis, defecating on its legs, to lower its body temperature. Despite its bill and large size, it is relatively unaggressive at a kill. The king vulture lacks a voice box, although it can make low croaking noises and <b>wheezing</b> sounds in courtship, and bill-snapping noises when threatened. Its only natural predators are snakes, which will prey upon the vulture's eggs and young, and large cats such as jaguars, which may surprise and kill an adult vulture at a carcass.|$|E

School children (n= 2188), enrolled {{in a survey of}} asthma, were classified into three mutually exclusive groups by parental report of: asthma, <b>wheeze,</b> and no asthma/no <b>wheeze.</b> A random sample of 80 children in each group was tested (n= 240). Among asthmatics, 68 % (95 % confidence interval (CI), 57 - 79) had a BHR (measured as PD 20 forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) {{less than or equal to}} 8. 16 mu mol using methacholine) compared to 31 % (CI 20 - 42 %) and 30 % (CI 19 - 40 %) in the <b>wheeze</b> and no asthma/no <b>wheeze</b> groups. The dose-response slope (DRS) confirmed the PD 20 data and distinguished equally between groups. EIB (greater than or equal to 10 % fall in FEV 1) was more frequent (40 %, CI 29 - 52 %) among asthmatics than among children with <b>wheeze</b> (12 %, CI 4 - 19 %) and no asthma/no <b>wheeze</b> (7 %, CI 1 - 13 %).

40|$|AbstractIntroductionWheeze is an {{important}} sign indicating a potentially severe adverse event in vaccine and drug trials, particularly in children. However, there are currently no consensus definitions of <b>wheeze</b> or associated respiratory compromise in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). ObjectiveTo identify definitions and severity grading scales of <b>wheeze</b> as an adverse event in vaccine and drug RCTs enrolling children < 5 years and to determine their diagnostic performance based on sensitivity, specificity and inter-observer agreement. MethodsWe performed a systematic review of electronic databases and reference lists with restrictions for trial settings, English language and publication date ≥ 1970. <b>Wheeze</b> definitions and severity grading were abstracted and ranked by a diagnostic certainty score based on sensitivity, specificity and inter-observer agreement. ResultsOf 1205 articles identified using our broad search terms, we identified 58 eligible trials conducted in 38 countries, mainly in high-income settings. Vaccines made up the majority (90 %) of interventions, particularly influenza vaccines (65 %). Only 15 trials provided explicit definitions of <b>wheeze.</b> Of 24 studies that described severity, 11 described <b>wheeze</b> severity {{in the context of}} an explicit <b>wheeze</b> definition. The remaining 13 studies described <b>wheeze</b> severity where <b>wheeze</b> was defined as part of a respiratory illness or a <b>wheeze</b> equivalent. <b>Wheeze</b> descriptions were elicited from caregiver reports (14 %), physical examination by a health worker (45 %) or a combination (41 %). There were 21 / 58 studies in which <b>wheeze</b> definitions included combined caregiver report and healthcare worker assessment. The use of these two methods appeared to have the highest combined sensitivity and specificity. ConclusionStandardized <b>wheeze</b> definitions and severity grading scales for use in pediatric vaccine or drug trials are lacking.

Objective To explore the effects of geohelminth infections and age on atopy, <b>wheeze,</b> and the association between atopy and <b>wheeze.</b> Methods A case-control study was done in 376 subjects (149 cases and 227 controls) aged 7 – 19 years living in rural communities in Ecuador. <b>Wheeze</b> cases, identified from a large cross-sectional survey, had recent <b>wheeze</b> and controls were a random sample of those without <b>wheeze.</b> Atopy was measured by the presence of allergen-specific IgE (asIgE) and skin prick test (SPT) responses to house dust mite and cockroach. Geohelminth infections were measured in stools and anti-Ascaris IgE in plasma. Results The fraction of recent <b>wheeze</b> attributable to anti-Ascaris IgE was 45. 9 %, while those for SPT and asIgE were 10. 0 % and 10. 5 % respectively. The association between atopy and <b>wheeze</b> was greater in adolescents than children. Although Anti-Ascaris IgE was strongly associated with <b>wheeze</b> (adj.

We performed a candidate gene association study to identify genetic determinants of recurrent <b>wheeze</b> after RSV LRTI. We investigated 346 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 220 candidate genes in 166 Dutch infants hospitalized for RSV LRTI. Logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} study associations between genotypes and haplotypes and recurrent <b>wheeze</b> after RSV LRTI. We found associations with recurrent <b>wheeze</b> for SNPs in IL 19, IL 20, MUC 5 AC, TNFRSF 1 B, C 3, CTLA 4, CXCL 9, IL 4 R, and IL 7 genes. Haplotype analysis of the combined IL 19 /IL 20 genotyped polymorphisms demonstrated an inverse association between the TGG haplotype and recurrent <b>wheeze</b> after RSV LRTI. IL 19 and IL 20 genes were notably associated with recurrent <b>wheeze</b> in infants without asthmatic parents. The association of IL 20 SNP rs 2981573 with recurrent <b>wheeze</b> was confirmed in a healthy birth cohort. We concluded that genetic variation in adaptive immunity genes and particularly in IL 19 /IL 20 genes associates with the development of recurrent <b>wheeze</b> after RSV LRTI, suggesting a role for these IL 10 family members in the etiology of airway disease during infancy...|$|R
