5|$|Scholarly {{consensus}} favours an Anglo-Saxon, probably Kentish origin for the Bayeux tapestry. This famous {{narrative of}} the Conquest is not a true woven tapestry but an embroidered hanging worked in <b>wool</b> <b>yarn</b> on a tabby-woven linen ground using outline or stem stitch for lettering and the outlines of figures, and couching or laid work for filling in figures.|$|E
25|$|A tightly spun <b>wool</b> <b>yarn</b> {{made from}} fibre {{with a long}} staple length in it is called worsted. It is hand spun from combed top, and the fibres all lie in the same {{direction}} as the yarn. A woollen yarn, in contrast, is hand spun from a rolag or other carded fibre (roving, batts), where the fibres are not as strictly aligned to the yarn created. The woollen yarn, thus, captures much more air, and makes for a softer and generally bulkier yarn. There are two main techniques to create these different yarns: short draw creates worsted yarns, and long draw creates woollen yarns. Often a spinner will spin using a combination of both techniques and thus make a semi-worsted yarn.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is aimed {{to study the}} influence of ammonia after-treatment on color behavior in <b>wool</b> <b>yarns</b> dyed with annatto extract. The dyeing was carried out using 15 % (o. w. f.) dye concentration in presence of stannous chloride as a mordant and then treated with different percentages of ammonia solution. At the same time, color strength, CIE-Lab values and fastness properties of all dyed woolen yarns were also assessed. It was concluded that, in all cases after treatment with ammonia caused a decrease in lightness (L*) values, there was less lightness in the red hue of the <b>wool</b> <b>yarns</b> {{with the increase of}} ammonia percentage in solution. The K/S value of annatto dyed wool was found to increase after treated with ammonia. In addition, it was also observed that dyed <b>wool</b> <b>yarns</b> after post-treatment with ammonia did not return to their original color on acidification...|$|R

500|$|With the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, {{the focus}} of English {{embroidery}} increasingly turned to clothing and household furnishings, leading to another great flowering of English domestic embroidery in the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras. [...] The end of this period saw {{the rise of the}} formal sampler as a record of the amateur stitcher's skills.

2500|$|Coldharbour Mill was {{primarily}} always {{used for the}} production of <b>wool</b> <b>yarn</b> for the weaving frames of the Wellington mill. The original grist mill was probably a three storey building, and the original sale notice of 1788 states [...] "The Stream divides in two Parts, one at each End of the House, and they are in a Manner two separate Mills, under the same Roof". A legal dispute of 1834 [...] contains a detailed map of the water courses, which are in their existing positions, with a leat to the front and rear of the grist mill.|$|E
6000|$|All {{these changes}} make the [...] "Rivers of Scotland" [...] rather melancholy reading. Thirty years have not passed since Lauder died, {{and how much}} he would miss if he could revisit his beloved water! Spearing salmon by torchlight is a {{forbidden}} thing. The rocks are no longer lit up with the red glow; they resound no longer with the shouts and splashing of the yeomen. You might almost as readily find a hart on Harthope, or a wild cat at Catslack, or a wolf at Wolf-Cleugh, as catch three stone-weight of trout in Meggat-water. {6} The days of guileless fish and fabulous draughts of trout are over. No sportsman need take three large baskets to the Gala now, as Lauder did, and actually filled them with thirty-six dozen of trout. The modern angler must not allow his expectations to be raised too highly by these stories. Sport has become much more difficult in these times of rapidly growing population. It is a pleasant sight to see the weavers spending their afternoons beside the Tweed; it is such a sight as could not be witnessed by the closely preserved rivers of England. But the weavers have taught the trout caution, and the dyes and various pollutions of trade have thinned their numbers. Mr. Ruskin sees no hope in this state of things; he preaches, in the spirit of old Hesiod, that there is no piety in a race which defiles the [...] "holy waters." [...] But surely civilization, even if it spoil sport and degrade scenery, is better than a state of things in which the laird would hang up his foes to an iron ring in the roof. The hill of Cowden Knowes may be a less eligible place for lovers' meetings than it was of old. But in those times the lord of Cowden Knowes is said by tradition to have had a way of putting his prisoners in barrels studded with iron nails, and rolling them down a brae. This is the side of the good old times which should not be overlooked. It may not be pleasant to find blue dye and <b>wool</b> <b>yarn</b> in Teviot, but it is more endurable than to have to encounter the bandit Barnskill, who hewed his bed of flint, Scott says, in Minto Crags. Still, the reading of the [...] "Rivers of Scotland" [...] leaves rather a sad impression on the reader, and makes him ask once more if {{there is no way of}} reconciling the beauty of rude ages with the comforts and culture of civilization. This is a question that really demands an answer, though it is often put in a mistaken way. The teachings of Mr. Ruskin and of his followers would bring us back to a time when printing was not, and an engineer would have been burned for a wizard. {8} But there is a point at which civilization and production must begin to respect the limits of the beautiful, on which they so constantly encroach. Who is to settle the limit, and escape the charge of being either a dilettante and a sentimentalist on the one hand, or a Philistine on the other? ...|$|E

30|$|Prior to mordanting, the <b>wool</b> <b>yarns</b> were {{immersed}} {{in an aqueous}} solution containing non-ionic detergent (5  mL/L) for 30  min for removing unwanted dust {{from the surface of}} the wool. Powdered A. catechu, 5.0 – 0.5  % o.w.f.

40|$|Air-drag on a {{ballooning}} yarn and balloon shape {{affect the}} yarn tension and ends-down (yarn breakage), {{which in turn}} affects energy consumption and yarn productivity in ring spinning. In this article, a mathematical model of yarn ballooning motion in ring spinning is established.

Yarn tension was measured using a computer data acquisition system and the balloon shapes were captured using a digital camera with video capability during the experiments using cotton and <b>wool</b> <b>yarns</b> at various balloon-heights and with varying yarn-length in the balloon.

40|$|Metal ions are {{frequently}} incorporated into crystalline materials {{to improve their}} electrochemical properties and to confer new physicochemical properties. Naturally-occurring phosphate apatite, which is formed geologically and in biomineralization processes, has extensive potential applications and is therefore an attractive functional material. In this study, we generate a novel building block for flexible optoelectronics using bio-inspired methods to deposit a layer of photoactive titanium-modified hydroxyapatite (TiHA) nanoparticles (NPs) on conductive polypyrrole(PPy) -coated <b>wool</b> <b>yarns.</b> The titanium concentration in the reaction solution was varied between 8 - 50 mol% {{with respect to the}} phosphorous, which led to titanate ions replacing phosphate in the hydroxyapatite lattice at levels up to 17 mol%. PPy was separately deposited on <b>wool</b> <b>yarns</b> by oxidative polymerization, using two dopants: (i) anthraquinone- 2, 6 -disulfonic acid to increase the conductivity of the PPy layer and (ii) pyroglutamic acid, to reduce the resistivity of the <b>wool</b> <b>yarns</b> and to promote the heterogeneous nucleation of the TiHA NPs. A specific titanium concentration (25 mol% wrt P) was used to endow the TiHA NPs on the PPy-coated fibers with a desirable band gap value of 3. 68 eV, and a specific surface area of 146 m 2 g- 1.

30|$|In this research, FTIR {{was used}} to examine the cystine {{oxidation}} products in <b>wool</b> <b>yarns</b> removed from historic tapestry fragments housed at Hampton Court Palace compared to undyed unaged wool and undyed artificially light aged undyed <b>wool</b> <b>yarns.</b> The level of oxidation of artificially aged wool was found to be lower than that of historic wools, supporting previous research carried out as part of the MODHT that the historic yarns were significantly more fragile than the artificially aged model samples. This research has demonstrated {{that it is possible to}} observe the progression of oxidation that historic wools in historic tapestries experience, potentially highlighting areas more susceptible to fibre strength and material loss. In this work, a conservative calibration model was developed using previously measured NIR spectra of historic tapestry fragments and the oxidation products of the same historic tapestry fragments measured in this research. Ratios were predicted for a validation set of historic tapestry fragments with known oxidation product ratios accurate to RMSEP of 0.11 for cysteic acid/cystine dioxide, 0.03 for an oxidation ratio of cysteic acid/cystine monoxide and 0.06 for cystine dioxide/cystine monoxide. Within a laboratory context it was demonstrated that it is possible to predict the unknown oxidation ratios of historic fragments using previous NIR results as demonstrated with an M-distance pass limit of 3, however this prediction does not yet translate to real on-site applications within a heritage context. While there is a known relationship between light induced oxidation and the formation of cystine breakdown products, historic <b>wool</b> <b>yarns</b> in tapestries are non-homogeneous materials having undergone cumulative damage due to exposure to various environmental risks. This oxidation process may have been influenced by the original chemicals treatments to fibres through dyeing and early conservation methods used to treat the tapestries. These risks may have both accelerated the formation of oxidation products and may have produced chemical breakdown products other than those caused by light. For this reason, there are likely other additional factors that influence the relationship between chemical degradation products and strength.|$|R
