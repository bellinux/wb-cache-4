5|$|Minogue was {{diagnosed}} <b>with</b> <b>breast</b> cancer at age 36 on 17 May 2005, {{leading to the}} postponement of the remainder of her Showgirl– The Greatest Hits Tour and her withdrawal from the Glastonbury Festival.

As media and fans began to congregate outside the Minogue residence in Melbourne, Victorian Premier Steve Bracks warned the international media that any disruption of the Minogue family's rights under Australian privacy laws would not be tolerated. His comments became part of a wider criticism of the media's overall reaction, with particular criticism directed towards paparazzi.|$|E

30|$|One {{treatment}} {{strategy that}} {{has been found to}} decrease the local discomfort and tissue tenderness at the bra strap-shoulder interface is bra removal [4]. Removing the external breast support provided by a bra, however, is likely to {{have a negative impact on}} the posture of women <b>with</b> large <b>breasts</b> [1, 12]. Research has shown an increased flexion torque on the thoracic spine among women <b>with</b> large <b>breasts,</b> <b>with</b> this torque thought to contribute to the greater thoracic kyphosis found in women <b>with</b> large <b>breasts</b> compared to women <b>with</b> small <b>breasts</b> [1, 12]. It is acknowledged that breast mass is also affected by breast density, which varies widely among women [8, 13]. Furthermore, bra removal may also have a negative effect on the physical activity level of women <b>with</b> large <b>breasts</b> because breast discomfort and embarrassment related to excessive breast movement are barriers to women participating in sport and exercise [14 - 16]. Promoting physical activity in women <b>with</b> large <b>breasts</b> is particularly important as breast mass and BMI are positively correlated [17], and it is imperative that all women, irrespective of breast mass, are able to enjoy the health benefits associated with an active lifestyle. Therefore, improving sports bra design is a more sensible treatment strategy to reduce local discomfort and tissue tenderness at the bra strap-shoulder interface compared to bra removal [4].|$|R

She is also a New Woman and a farmer, traits that made her {{stand out from the}} other female characters in The Archers {{at the time of her}} introduction. In later years, Ruth has mellowed and is more open to negotiation. Her storylines have often revolved around her marriage to David and her work on Brookfield Farm. In the early 2000s, the scriptwriters had Ruth and David isolate themselves from the community during a foot-and-mouth outbreak. Ruth was also diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>breast</b> cancer, a storyline which Finch undertook extensive research for and later named as one of her Archers highlights.|$|E
5|$|When Hurricane Hugo {{destroyed}} the island's only Olympic-sized swimming pool in 1989, Duncan {{was forced to}} swim in the ocean and he quickly lost his enthusiasm for swimming because of his fear of sharks. Duncan was dealt another emotional blow when his mother was diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>breast</b> cancer and died one day before his 14th birthday. In her last days, she made Duncan and his sisters promise to finish college with a degree, which would later explain Duncan's refusal to leave college early. Duncan never swam competitively again, but was inspired by his brother-in-law to turn to basketball.|$|E
5|$|Anne was ill for 15 {{months after}} the birth of her {{youngest}} son, Edgar. She bore Henrietta in 1669 and Catherine in 1671. Anne never recovered from Catherine's birth. Ill <b>with</b> <b>breast</b> cancer, she died on 31 March 1671. On her deathbed, her two brothers Henry and Laurence tried to bring an Anglican priest to give her communion, but Anne refused and she received viaticum of the Catholic Church. Two days after her death, her embalmed body was interred in the vault of Mary, Queen of Scots, at Westminster Abbey's Henry VII Chapel. In June 1671, Anne's only surviving son Edgar died of natural causes, followed by Catherine in December, leaving Mary and Anne as the Duke of York's heiresses.|$|E
40|$|There are now five studies, {{including}} {{the report of}} Akil and co-workers {{in this issue of}} the Br J Cancer, for which the relationship between age of women and high-risk human papilloma virus (HPV) -positive breast cancer, has been published.
