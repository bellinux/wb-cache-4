5|$|In {{selecting}} Ved Vejen for the Danish Culture Canon, {{the selection}} committee {{operating under the}} Danish Ministry of Culture explained that the attraction {{of the novel is}} that it portrays with considerable empathy how a meek young woman becomes increasingly aware of desires she hardly knew she possessed. With bittersweet irony, the author allows Katinka to develop her infatuation by listening to the heartaches of others. With its almost cinematic sequences, the novel conveys a balance between its subdued humour and a strong sympathy for <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> in people's minds, especially in a secluded environment removed from mainstream society. It is not just Bang's portrayal of a bygone provincial world that seems so typically Danish but his mastery in making the hidden pain of loneliness so meaningful to today's readership. In 1988 it was made into a feature film Katinka, directed by Max von Sydow, starring Tammi Øst as Katinka.|$|E

Furthermore, as former colonial powers, we both have important international interests.|$|E
25|$|The many-worlds {{interpretation}} originally {{outlined by}} Hugh Everett III in 1957 is partly meant {{to reconcile the}} differences between Einstein's and Bohr's views by replacing Bohr's wave function collapse with an ensemble of deterministic and independent universes whose distribution is governed by wave functions and the Schrödinger equation. Thus, uncertainty in the many-worlds interpretation follows from each observer within any universe having no knowledge of <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> in the other universes.|$|E

25|$|Any {{explanation}} of <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> {{in a specific}} individual observation of one photon has {{to take into account}} the whole experimental apparatus of the complete quantum state consisting of both photons, and it can only make sense after all information concerning complementary variables has been recorded. Our results demonstrate that the viewpoint that the system photon behaves either definitely as a wave or definitely as a particle would require faster-than-light communication. Because this would be in strong tension with the special theory of relativity, we believe that such a viewpoint should be given up entirely.|$|E
25|$|Transient (state) {{loneliness}} {{is temporary}} in nature, caused by {{something in the}} environment, and is easily relieved. Chronic (trait) loneliness is more permanent, caused by the person, and is not easily relieved. For example, {{when a person is}} sick and cannot socialize with friends would be a case of transient loneliness. Once the person got better it would be easy for them to alleviate their loneliness. A person who feels lonely regardless of if they are at a family gathering, with friends, or alone is experiencing chronic loneliness. It does not matter <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> in the surrounding environment, the experience of loneliness is always there.|$|E

In the third verse, Harrison declares that piggies are [...] "everywhere", leading [...] "piggy lives". He presents a final image of couples dining, holding their cutlery before devouring bacon.|$|E

Actress Eihi Shiina stated that, in Japan, only a certain type of film fan would watch Audition. By comparison, she said, the film was seen by many more people overseas, which she attributed to [...] "good timing".|$|E

500|$|Lewis {{promoted}} the song on several live television programmes, such as Good Morning America, Live with Regis and Kelly, {{and on the}} 2008 American Music Awards, and it was included on the set list of her debut concert tour The Labyrinth (2010). The music video was filmed by Sophie Muller at Hampton Court House School, London in February 2008. On it, Lewis is shown performing in front of several photographic set-ups, and shows <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> {{behind the scenes of}} them. Receiving generally positive reviews by music critics, it was nominated at the Brit Awards in the category [...] "Best British Single". [...] "Better in Time" [...] reached number two in the national music charts of the United Kingdom and Germany, as well as the top ten in several countries, including Australia, Canada, Ireland, Italy and New Zealand. The single was certified gold in Australia, Denmark and Germany, and silver in the UK.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked by}} TV Guide if he would've {{remained}} on General Hospital had the show's producers [...] "tried harder" [...] to accommodate his personal life, Burton stated: [...] "I don't {{want to point}} fingers. I {{know there are a}} lot of disappointed fans. They don't really understand <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> behind the doors. They don't understand why I wouldn't go back to play Jason if I'm ready to work again. But what happens at GH should stay at GH." [...] Phelps dismissed rumors that she has [...] "lured" [...] Burton away from General Hospital. While clarifying rumors about him leaving General Hospital because of Phelps' appointment as executive producer of The Young and the Restless, Burton described them as [...] "interesting". He told On-Air On-Soaps that he knew people would try to put [...] "two and two together", but it was never his intention to leave General Hospital purposely, as he just couldn't reach a contractual agreement with the show. [...] "It’s just like a sports player...when a deal does not work out with his team, there might be another team out there that might want him," [...] Burton said. During the week Burton debuted on the series as Dylan, the show experienced an increase of over 105,000 viewers, averaging 4.7 million viewers. Michael Fairman, during an interview with Burton, noted the [...] "significant increase" [...] in viewers, which Burton was a [...] "big reason" [...] for.|$|E
500|$|The video {{starts with}} a news anchor (played by Kristina Mitchell) saying {{the title of the}} song above a news banner that reads [...] "Britney Spears song lyrics spell out {{obscenity}} in disguise". This is a parody of an America's Newsroom report by Megyn Kelly. It then skips to a house, in which a sex party is coming to an end. Spears starts singing while {{sitting on the edge of}} a bed while the people that surround her are getting dressed. She gets up and looks out the window. As the first verse ends, she picks up a pair of panties from the floor, recalling her personal struggles and the [...] "Piece of Me" [...] video. She dances with four male dancers in the first chorus. During the second chorus, she dances with four other female dancers dressed in cheerleading outfits, while many men are watching them dance. The screen fades to white and Spears begins to change into a conservative '50s-inspired housewife outfit. As the chorus begins again, she comes out of her bedroom. She walks down the stairs, with dancers surrounding her and a woman gives her a potholder, which she uses to pick up a pie. After this, she walks out the front door of the house and is joined by her seemingly conservative-looking husband and children, one of them dressed with the schoolgirl outfit Spears wore in the [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] video. As they go down the walkway, they are surrounded by paparazzi, who have no idea <b>what</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> behind closed doors. While the kids and husband wave, Spears smiles for the camera and blows a kiss. The video then ends with the news anchor saying, [...] "Doesn't make any sense, does it?".|$|E
