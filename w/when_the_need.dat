5|$|For comparison, its {{population}} was only 20,000 in 1969 and 150,000 in 1980. Part {{of the difficulty}} in estimating the city's population {{is that part of}} it is nomadic, setting up tents in suitable locations, then packing up <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> strikes. Some estimates put the 2008 population at over 2 million, estimated to be close to one-third of the country's population. The 2013 census gave the city's population as 958,399.|$|E
5|$|The Frontier Militia {{represents}} the military {{arm of the}} Frontier systems' territorial defense pact. The Militia is a loosely governed mishmash of homesteaders, bandits, mercenaries, and pirates, all rising up as 'citizen soldiers' <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> arises. Each brigade within the Militia is responsible for fighting in an assigned section of Frontier territory. Although some brigades {{are little more than}} vast pirate organizations, the Militia has enough resources to be a real obstacle to the IMC's ambitions on the Frontier. The Militia often claims that direct action against the IMC {{is in the best interest}} of the homesteaders whom they allegedly represent, but not everyone on the Frontier sees it that way.|$|E

5|$|As the game's {{emphasis}} is on stealth, players are encouraged to focus on concealment, evasion, distraction, misdirection, and subtle takedowns, rather than on outright confrontation; the player's character can engage in sword-based combat <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> arises, and can perform three different attacks as well as parrying, but has limited proficiency and damage resistance in such circumstances. To do so, players must remain aware of their surroundings. To assist them in remaining hidden, a special meter on the heads-up display (HUD), {{in the form of}} a gem, helps to indicates the player's visibility to NPCs; the brighter it is, the more easier they can be visually detected, thus sticking to dark, shady spots where the gem dims, ensures the player is hidden, though NPCs can still find them if they get to close in front of them. To remain quiet, players must be careful of how much noise they produce, as well as what surfaces they are moving over; walking on soft surfaces like carpets and grass, is preferable as footsteps remain quiet, compared to walking over metal floors and ceramic tiles, which produce a lot of noise. NPCs also produce noise, either from whistling, or walking about for example, which can help player's determine where how far away they are to their own position. Noise can be used by the player to mislead/distract NPCs, such as throwing an object to lure them elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|In general, energy can {{be stored}} in a capacitor, super capacitor, or battery. Capacitors are used <b>when</b> <b>the</b> {{application}} <b>needs</b> to provide huge energy spikes.

5000|$|Malinowski {{originated}} {{the school}} of social anthropology known as functionalism.

25|$|These {{were issued}} by merchants in payment for goods with the {{agreement}} {{that they would be}} redeemed in goods to an equivalent value at the merchants' own outlets. The transaction is therefore one of barter, with the tokens playing a role of convenience, allowing the seller to receive his goods at a rate and time convenient to himself and the merchant, to tie the holder of the token coin to his shop. Trade tokens often change slowly and subtly into barter tokens over time, as evidenced by the continued circulation of former trade tokens <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for their use had passed.|$|E
25|$|As {{injuries}} and {{the aging process}} took their toll, Martínez made the adjustment to rely more on finesse than power. His fastball settled into the 85–88mph range, although {{he was able to}} occasionally reach 90–91mph <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> arose. Martínez continued to use a curveball, a circle changeup, and an occasional slider. With his command of the strike zone, he remained an effective strikeout pitcher despite the drop in velocity. Baseball historian Bill James described Martínez as being substantially more effective than his pitching peers due to his variety of pitches, pitch speeds, pinpoint control, and numerous modes of deception.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 18th century, the combat ability of Zaporozhia was greatly reduced, {{especially}} after the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca and the Russian annexation of Crimea, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for the Host to guard the borders was removed. At the same time, the Zaporozhian's other enemy, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, was also weakened and {{on the verge of}} being partitioned. This meant that militarily the Zaporozhian Sich was becoming increasingly superfluous, but at the same time their existence caused friction with Imperial Russian authorities who wanted to colonise the newly acquired lands that the Cossacks inhabited. After a number of Cossack attacks on Serbian colonies and with Cossack support offered to Yemelyan Pugachev, the Russian Empress Catherine the Great issued an order to General Pyotr Tekeli to end the troublesome Sich.|$|E
