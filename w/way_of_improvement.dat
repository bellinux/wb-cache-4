6000|$|In {{order to}} show how little effect these writers had upon the public mind, I will quote a few {{passages}} from the writings of Sir Charles Lyell, as representing {{the opinions of the}} most advanced thinkers in the period immediately preceding that of Darwin's work. When recapitulating the facts and arguments in favour of the invariability and permanence of species, he says: [...] "The entire variation from the original type which any given kind of change can produce may usually be effected in a brief period of time, after which no further deviation can be obtained by continuing to alter the circumstances, though ever so gradually, indefinite divergence either in the <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>improvement</b> or deterioration being prevented, and the least possible excess beyond the defined limits being fatal to the existence of the individual." [...] In another place he maintains that [...] "varieties of some species may differ more than other species do from each other without shaking our confidence in the reality of species." [...] He further adduces certain facts in geology as being, in his opinion, [...] "fatal to the theory of progressive development," [...] and he explains {{the fact that there are}} so often distinct species in countries of similar climate and vegetation by [...] "special creations" [...] in each country; and these conclusions were arrived at after a careful study of Lamarck's work, a full abstract of which is given in the earlier editions of the Principles of Geology.[2] ...|$|E

30|$|The second <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>improvement</b> of photo-catalytic {{activity}} {{is caused by}} the high-specific surface area of the p-Co 3 O 4 /n-ZnO heterostructures. The molecules’ absorption-desorption on the surface of catalyst {{is the first step in}} degradation process [54, 62]. Consequently, higher surface-to-volume ratio in the developed morphology of p-Co 3 O 4 /n-ZnO heterostructures provides more unsaturated surface coordination sites, as shown in Table  2. The p-Co 3 O 4 /n-ZnO heterostructures possess higher specific surface area caused by numerous ultrathin nano-lamellas, as confirmed by SEM characterizations. Therefore, high surface-to-volume ratio and suitable interfaces obtained for the Co 3 O 4 /ZnO- 35 heterostructure resulted in its outstanding photocatalytic activity towards the efficient MO degradation.|$|E
