5|$|The main factor which boosted {{industry}} and trade under the Ayyubids {{was the new}} interests Europeans developed when they {{came into contact with}} the Muslims. Commodities included incense, scents, fragrant oils, and aromatic plants from Arabia and India, as well as ginger, alum, and aloes. Likewise, Europeans developed new tastes in the matter of fashions, clothing, and home furnishing. Rugs, carpets, and tapestries manufactured in the Middle East and Central Asia <b>were</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> West through Crusader-Ayyubid interaction. Christian pilgrims visiting Jerusalem returned with Arab reliquaries for the keeping of relics. In addition, eastern works of art in glass, pottery, gold, silver, etc., were highly prized in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Toyah Laverne Battersby is {{a fictional}} {{character}} from the British soap opera Coronation Street, played by Georgia Taylor. Toyah {{and her family}} <b>were</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> serial by executive producer Brian Park {{in a bid to}} increase falling ratings. Actress and singer Toyah Willcox gave the producers permission to name the youngest member of the Battersby family after herself, since the character was said to be born during the height of her career. Taylor originally auditioned for the part of Zoe Tattersall, but was cast as Toyah instead. The role marked her acting debut. She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 4 July 1997.|$|E

5|$|As {{part of a}} {{study on}} adaptation, 57 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) <b>were</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island of Desecheo and other {{southern}} off-shore islands and cays in 1967. Prior to the introduction, Desecheo was the largest nesting colony of the brown booby, but mainly {{as a result of}} egg predation by the introduced macaques, no bird species presently nests in the island. Efforts to trap and remove the species have been unsuccessful and it has expanded its range to southwestern Puerto Rico. Other primates also have established populations in Puerto Rico. As a result of vandalism, 107 squirrel monkeys escaped from a research station at Sabana Seca in the late 1970s. The latest estimate for this population is 35 individuals.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{isolated}} coastal location, the Isle of Portland has {{an extensive}} range of flora and fauna; the coastline and disused quarries are designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. Sea and migratory birds occupy the cliffs in different seasons, sometimes these include rare species which draw ornithologists {{from around the}} country. Rare visitors to the surrounding seas include dolphins, seals and basking sharks. Chesil Beach {{is one of only}} two sites in Britain where the scaly cricket can be found; unlike any other cricket it is wingless and does not sing or hop. Ten British Primitive goats <b>were</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> East Weares part of the island to control scrub in 2007.|$|E
5|$|For {{a variety}} of reasons, {{including}} normal trade {{in the area and}} attempts to improve the breed, Arabian, Thoroughbred, Welsh pony, and Hackney blood had been added to ponies in the New Forest. Over time, however, the better-quality ponies were sold off, leaving the poorer-quality and less hardy animals as the Forest breeding stock. To address this situation, as well as to increase the stock's hardiness and restore native type, {{in the early twentieth century}} animals from other British native mountain and moorland pony breeds such as the Fell, Dales, Highland, Dartmoor, and Exmoor <b>were</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Forest. This practice ended in 1930, and since that time, only purebred New Forest stallions may be turned out. The New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society has been publishing the stud book since 1960. New Forest ponies have been exported to many parts of the world, including Canada, the U.S., Europe, and Australia, and many countries now have their own breed societies and stud books.|$|E

5|$|In 1992 {{the sons}} of Miguel Vázquez <b>were</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wrestling world as Espanto IV and Espanto V, forming a regular tag team in and around Monterrey, Nuevo León, Mexico. The duo lost their masks to the team of Blue Fish and Mongol Chino, {{although}} the team of Stuka and Stuka Jr. is also credited with unmasking them. It is possible that Espanto IV and V agreed to lose their masks to both teams, but in different locations in Mexico. Before the internet there were examples of luchadors getting an additional payment for losing their mask on multiple occasions. The brothers have worked for various Mexican promotions and toured Japan while working for the Japanese Universal Wrestling Federation and Michinoku Pro. In Japan they unsuccessfully challenged the Great Sasuke and Gran Hamada for the UWA/UWF Intercontinental Tag Team Championship.|$|E
5|$|In the Babylonian star {{catalogues}} {{dating from}} at least 1100 BCE, what later became known as Corvus was called the Raven (MUL.UGA.MUSHEN). As with more familiar Classical astronomy, it was placed sitting on {{the tail of the}} Serpent (Greek Hydra). The Babylonian constellation was sacred to Adad, the god of rain and storm; in the second Millennium it would have risen just before the autumnal rainy season. John H. Rogers observed that Hydra signified Ningishzida, the god of the underworld in the Babylonian compendium MUL.APIN. He proposed that Corvus and Crater (along with Hydra) were death symbols and marked the gate to the underworld. These two constellations, along with the eagle Aquila and the fish Piscis Austrinus, <b>were</b> <b>introduced</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Greeks around 500 BCE; they marked the winter and summer solstices respectively. Furthermore, Hydra had been a landmark as it had straddled the celestial equator in antiquity. Corvus and Crater also featured in the iconography of Mithraism, which is thought to have been of middle-eastern origin before spreading into Ancient Greece and Rome.|$|E
