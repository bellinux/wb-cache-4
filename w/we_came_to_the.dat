[...] "nstead of cutting corners or compromising our vision, <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tough decision that the game deserved a few extra weeks to ensure every detail of The Last of Us was up to Naughty Dog’s internal high standards," [...] Naughty Dog stated in a press release.|$|E

2500|$|We {{resolved}} not {{to embarrass}} a family, {{in a time}} of so much sorrow, if any other expedient could he found; and as the Island of Ulva was over-against us, it was determined that we should pass the strait and have recourse to the Laird, who, like the other gentlemen of the Islands, was known to Col.

2500|$|Espuelas said to The Industry Standard, [...] "As a kid I had {{to leave}} my home country, Uruguay, when my parents got {{divorced}} and my mother couldn't support herself. We lost everything overnight, so <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> United States. For 10 years {{we lived in a}} one-bedroom apartment, and my mother worked 12 hours a day. It is not that these types of experiences make you a better person, but they give you a different perspective on failure. I've seen people older than I go into panic mode and lose confidence in themselves because of tough market conditions, thinking that it's the end of the world. Personally, I always know I'll be able to survive." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{developers}} {{originally thought}} the game's target audience would be fairly adult-age. Towers notes: [...] "We {{started out with}} an idea that the users {{are going to be}} fairly old, but then as we sort of made the game we focused it. We realized that lots of different people get fun out of the game in lots of different ways. We tested on young kids, we tested on adults, we tested on a mix of the two, and <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that anyone can play this game. We very much wanted the game to be accessible from the start so that you can play alongside your granny or with your kids. We saw people enjoying it from all ages." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 10, 1896, Herzl {{was visited}} by Reverend William Hechler, the Anglican {{minister}} to the British Embassy. Hechler had read Herzl's Der Judenstaat, and the meeting became central to the eventual legitimization of Herzl and Zionism., Herzl later wrote in his diary, [...] "Next <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> heart of the business. I said to him: (Theodor Herzl to Rev. William Hechler) I must put myself into direct and publicly known relations with a responsible or non responsible ruler– that is, with a minister of state or a prince. [...] Then the Jews will believe in me and follow me. The most suitable personage would be the German Kaiser." [...] Hechler arranged an extended audience with Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden, in April, 1896. The Grand Duke was the uncle of the German Emperor Wilhelm II. [...] Through the efforts of Hechler and the Grand Duke, Herzl publicly met Wilhelm II in 1898. The meeting significantly advanced Herzl's and Zionism's legitimacy in Jewish and world opinion.|$|E
2500|$|George Martin {{claimed he}} first heard {{it at the}} [...] "Love Me Do" [...] re-make session on 11 September. Ringo Starr in Anthology stated: [...] "On my first visit in September we just ran through some tracks for George Martin. We even did 'Please Please Me'. I {{remember}} that, because while we were recording it I was playing the bass drum with a maraca {{in one hand and}} a tambourine in the other." [...] John Lennon in Anthology stated: [...] "We'd had a top 30 entry with 'Love Me Do' and we really thought we were on top of the world. Then came 'Please Please Me'—and wham! We tried to make it as simple as possible. Some of the stuff we've written in the past has been a bit way-out, but we aimed this one straight at the hit parade. … We almost abandoned it as the b-side of 'Love Me Do'. We changed our minds only because we were so tired the night we did Love Me Do. We'd been going over it a few times and when <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> question of the flipside, we intended using 'Please Please Me'. Our recording manager, George Martin, thought our arrangement was fussy, so we tried to make it simpler. We were getting very tired, though, and we just couldn't seem to get it right. We are conscientious about our work and we don't like to rush things." ...|$|E
