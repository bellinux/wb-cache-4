60|$|The {{system we}} have {{advocated}} {{is a form}} of Guild Socialism, leaning more, perhaps, towards Anarchism than the official Guildsman would wholly approve.

It is by its effects outside economics and politics, {{at least as much as}} by effects inside them, that a social system should be judged.

6000|$|A [...] "neck," [...] in West Chester and Long Island parlance, means {{something}} that might be better termed a [...] "head and shoulders," [...] if mere shape and dimensions are kept in view. Peninsula would be the true word, were we describing things on a geographical scale; but, as they are, I find it necessary to adhere to the local term, which is not altogether peculiar to our county, by the way. The [...] "neck" [...] or peninsula of Satanstoe, contains just four hundred and sixty-three acres and a half of excellent West Chester land; and that, when the stone is hauled and laid into wall, is saying as much in its favour as need be said of any soil on earth. It has two miles of beach, and collects a proportionate quantity of sea-weed for manure, besides enjoying near a hundred acres of salt-meadow and sedges, that are not included in the solid ground of the neck proper. As my father, Major Evans Littlepage, was to inherit this estate from his father, Capt. Hugh Littlepage, it might, even at the time of my birth, be considered old family property, it having indeed, been acquired by my grandfather, through his wife, about thirty years after the final cession of the colony to the English by its original Dutch owners. Here we had lived, then, near half a century, when I was born, in the direct line, and considerably longer if <b>we</b> <b>included</b> maternal ancestors; here I now live, at the moment of writing these lines, and here I trust my only son is to live after me.|$|E

5000|$|All {{attempts}} at detecting and attributing climate change signals need a reliable observed data set and simulations with mechanisms that drive climate change included. In a nutshell, {{this paper is}} important {{because it was the first}} study to investigate the effect of sulphate aerosols in a general circulation model of the climate system. The experiments simulate the climate back to 1860 (which is when the global records of surface temperature became reliable)... After 1970 our model with greenhouse gases alone begins to depart significantly from the observations. However, when <b>we</b> <b>included</b> sulphate aerosols, which have a cooling effect, the model agreed with the data from the 1930s and onwards. The rapid warming that has taken place since 1970 is, according to the model, attributable to a heating effect from greenhouse gases and a cooling effect from sulphate aerosols.|$|E

5000|$|Amanda is {{the owner}} of a prospering {{business}} that produces movie trailers. A fan of Meyers' work, Diaz signed on after reading parts of the script. Commenting on her decision to play Amanda, Diaz said that her character [...] "was totally relatable to because we've all had these relationships that fail. But I loved the bravery that she displays. She ... learns about who she is and opens herself up to possibilities she's never allowed herself to have before. I felt that was such a wonderful message to put out there." [...] Meyers, who envisioned casting her still during the writing process, compared Diaz' performance in the film to Goldie Hawn, complimenting her adeptness at physical comedy: [...] "It's really hard I think to be that cute and sexy and that funny and that sort of girl-friendly [...]. She seemed absolutely the right choice for a California girl," [...] she commented. In developing her character, Diaz also improvised on set: [...] "There were a few scenes that were written on the page but then Nancy and I fooled around with them a bit. We didn’t want to take it comedy too broad. We wanted it to be believable, so <b>we</b> <b>included</b> realistic moments," [...] she said.|$|E

I recorded Hot Dogs & Donuts at The Comedy Palace in Andover, Massachusetts. Ron Sava's club always had the kind of buzz that I could only always count on in a few places. One of the others was Rascals in West Orange, where they taped the [...] "Stump The Joke Man" [...] footage that's on the DVD <b>we</b> <b>included</b> with Snart. I had edited almost the entire Hot Dogs & Donuts CD when I performed at The Comedy Palace again. From listening for hours and hours as I edited, the jokes were even more deeply & perfectly engrained in my little head, so I blasted away at those crowds like never before. The tapes from that weekend pushed the older tapes off the shelf and I started editing again. But that editing was minimal. The finished product is pretty funny and a healthy leap dirtier than the first two CD's. Not by design, it just is." ...|$|E
