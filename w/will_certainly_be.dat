These cars are usually only used to respond to emergency incidents, so are designed to travel fast, and may carry specialist equipment, such as assault rifles, or shotguns. In the UK, each station usually only has one, which is called an area car.|$|E

25|$|Syntactic {{dependencies}} are {{the focus}} of most work in dependency grammar, as stated above. How the presence and the direction of syntactic dependencies are determined is of course often open to debate. In this regard, it must be acknowledged that the validity of syntactic dependencies in the trees throughout this article is being taken for granted. However, these hierarchies are such that many dependency grammars can largely support them, although there <b>will</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> points of disagreement. The basic question about how syntactic dependencies are discerned has proven difficult to answer definitively. One should acknowledge in this area, however, that the basic task of identifying and discerning the presence and direction of the syntactic dependencies of dependency grammars is no easier or harder than determining the constituent groupings of constituency grammars. A variety of heuristics are employed to this end, basic constituency tests being useful tools; the syntactic dependencies assumed in the trees in this article are grouping words together in a manner that most closely matches the results of standard permutation, substitution, and ellipsis constituency tests. Etymological considerations also provide helpful clues about the direction of dependencies. A promising principle upon which to base the existence of syntactic dependencies is distribution. When one is striving to identify the root of a given phrase, the word that is most responsible for determining the distribution of that phrase as a whole is its root.|$|E

500|$|The {{siege of}} Malakand was Winston Churchill's first {{experience}} of actual combat, which he later described in several columns for The Daily Telegraph, receiving £5 per column; these articles were eventually compiled into his first published book, The Story of the Malakand Field Force, beginning {{his career as}} a writer and politician. Of the book's publication he remarked, [...] " [...] <b>will</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> the most noteworthy act of my life. Up to date (of course). By its reception I shall measure the chances of my possible success in the world." [...] Of the siege of Malakand, and of the entire campaign against the Pashtun tribes in northern India, Churchill remarked that they were a period of significant [...] "transition".|$|E

500|$|The task Clinton left Cornwallis {{with was}} to, first and foremost, {{preserve}} the gains made by taking Charleston, {{and only then}} engage in offensive moves. Clinton's orders gave Cornwallis wide latitude in how to achieve the goal of pacifying both South and North Carolina, after which Clinton expected Cornwallis to move into Virginia. [...] Clinton wrote, [...] "I should wish you to assist in operations which <b>will</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> carried on in the Chesapeake {{as soon as we}} are relieve from our apprehension of a superior fleet and the season will admit ..." [...] However, Clinton provided Cornwallis with a relatively modest force of British, German, and provincial (Loyalist) regimentsabout 3,000 menwith which to accomplish all of this. [...] The forces he was given to accomplish this were limited by the necessity of keeping a large British force in New York under Clinton to shadow Washington. [...] Cornwallis was expected to recruit more Loyalists, who were believed to be more numerous in the southern colonies.|$|E

500|$|The victors in the 1857 state {{legislative}} campaign would, once they convened in October, elect a United States Senator. Former Whig governor William B. Campbell {{wrote to his}} uncle, [...] "The great anxiety of the Whigs is to elect {{a majority in the}} legislature so as to defeat Andrew Johnson for senator. Should the Democrats have the majority, he <b>will</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> their choice, and there is no man living to whom the Americans and Whigs have as much antipathy as Johnson." [...] The governor spoke widely in the campaign, and his party won the gubernatorial race and control of the legislature. Johnson's final address as governor gave him the chance to influence his electors, and he made proposals popular among Democrats. Two days later the legislature elected him to the Senate. The opposition was appalled, with the Richmond Whig newspaper referring to him as [...] "the vilest radical and most unscrupulous demagogue in the Union." ...|$|E
500|$|The Elector in Augsburg was {{informed}} on 14 July that Tallard {{was on his}} way through the Black Forest. This good news bolstered the Elector's policy of inaction, further encouraging him to wait for the reinforcements. But this reticence to fight induced Marlborough to undertake a controversial policy of spoliation in Bavaria, burning buildings and crops throughout the rich lands south of the Danube. This had two aims: firstly to put pressure on the Elector to fight or come to terms before Tallard arrived with reinforcements; and secondly, to ruin Bavaria as a base from which the French and Bavarian armies could attack Vienna, or pursue the Duke into Franconia if, at some stage, he had to withdraw northwards. But this destruction, coupled with a protracted siege of Rain (9–16 July), caused Prince Eugene to lament [...] "...since the Donauwörth action I cannot admire their performances", and later to conclude [...] "If he has to go home without having achieved his objective, he <b>will</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> ruined." [...] Nevertheless, strategically the Duke had been able to place his numerically stronger forces between the Franco-Bavarian army and Vienna.|$|E
500|$|In 1895, Palairet was {{fourth in}} the {{national}} batting averages, having scored 1,313 runs at 46.89. The three batsmen above him, Archie MacLaren, Grace and Ranjitsinhji all appeared for England that year. Palairet scored three centuries during the season; two against Middlesex, on the latter occasion batting undefeated through the whole Somerset innings, and one against Yorkshire, when he struck 165. He passed a thousand runs again the following year, maintaining a batting average in excess of 40. A fourth-innings score of 83 not out that season drew praise from Ranjitsinhji; on a difficult pitch, Palairet farmed the strike and rescued a draw for his side. Just over a month later, he reached his highest total in first-class cricket, scoring 292 runs against Hampshire. It was his first double century, and the highest score by any Somerset batsman in first-class cricket at that time. One newspaper in Australia, reporting on his innings, declared that; [...] "should he retain his form he <b>will</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> worthy of a place... in the final Test match at the Oval." [...] Either side of that match against Hampshire, he appeared for the Gentlemen against the Players at The Oval and Lord's, but made little impact on either game. He returned to form against Sussex on their visit to Taunton, sharing a 249-run partnership with his brother, and scoring 154 runs himself. The match was played shortly before the final Test match against Australia, but despite the comments in the Australian press, Palairet was not selected for the match. He did appear twice against the tourists that summer, for Somerset he scored six across two innings, and chosen to play for Charles Thornton's XI during the Scarborough Festival, he scored 71 runs in an innings victory.|$|E

2500|$|Josephine Seaton, a keen {{observer}} {{and the daughter}} [...] of {{the publisher of the}} National Intelligencer,William Seaton, states the navy yard strikers {{played a significant role in}} the Snow riot: [...] "Snow <b>will</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> torn to pieces by the mechanics if he be caught, and they are in full pursuit of him. Unfortunately, several hundred mechanics of the navy yard are out of employment, who, aided and abetted by their sympathizers, create the mob, — the first I have ever seen, not recollecting those of Sheffield, and it is truly alarming." [...] Seaton was one of the few whites to record the strike, a strike which revealed the corrosive effects of racism on the navy yard workforce as white workers sought to blame their own precarious economic situation on free and enslaved African Americans. The riot was widely publicized in many newspapers and alarmed the white community. As their economic situation deteriorated and stung by public criticism of their actions the navy yard mechanics and laborers sought to end the strike. The two sides came together in an agreement that both Hull and the workers accepted through the offices of an outside mediator, Dr. Alexander A. McWilliams, who had a medical practice adjacent to the navy yard and was known to both the workforce and Hull as a result the Department of the Navy encouraged mediation and the navy yard labor strike ended on 15 August 1835 when the mechanics returned to work.|$|E

2500|$|Later {{assessments}} of the opera have often mentioned both the opera's strong and weak points. [...] Audrey Williamson wrote in a 1982 book that the virtues of The Sorcerer, [...] "in spite of its defects ... justify {{its place in the}} repertoire." [...] In 1996, Ian Bradley commented in the introduction to his annotated edition of the Gilbert and Sullivan libretti, [...] "It <b>will</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>be</b> a great pity if it gradually fades away. The Sorcerer contains two of W. S. Gilbert's best-drawn characters, the soulful Dr Daly ... and the flashy but ultimately tragic figure of John Wellington Wells. Sir Arthur Sullivan's music is delightful and guaranteed to weave a magic spell over all those who hear it, if not actually to make them fall instantly in love with their next-door neighbours." [...] The New York Times commented in 2012 that the plot [...] "has not aged especially well. Its references to rank are dated beyond empathy’s reach; filled with sly allusions, its assumptions about a general audience's musical knowledge are unrealistic. Without those cues what remains is neither as exotic nor as amusing as Pinafore, Pirates or The Mikado. [...] Still, The Sorcerer packs ample charms, including a felicitous score, a Verdian drinking song turned to teetotal ends, and at least one chorus that has reached the periphery of pop culture. ... the work can entrance a modern audience". However, Isaac Goldberg, one of the first Gilbert scholars, in 1913 called it [...] "the weakest of Gilbert's productions".|$|E
