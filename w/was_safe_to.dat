The town's annual water report for 2016 assured residents that Jerome's water met all {{state and federal}} requirements and <b>was</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> drink. Jerome administers its own sewer system, trash collection, and recycling services. Its public works department maintains the equipment and infrastructure associated with these systems as well the water system, streets, parks, and other city property.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{had been}} raised that the {{radiation}} belt produced in orbit by the recent Operation Dominic nuclear tests would be dangerous to manned space missions, but an extensive study announced in early September declared that it <b>was</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> fly. While {{the outside of the}} capsule was expected to receive a dosage of around 500 röntgens, the study concluded that shielding and the effect of the spacecraft structure would reduce this to around 8 röntgens experienced by the astronaut, well within established tolerance limits.|$|E
5|$|Hawes {{remained}} at Nelly's Ford until May 1865. Finally satisfied that it <b>was</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> return to Kentucky, Hawes arrived in Paris {{to find his}} home had been burned by Union troops. Four of Hawes's sons served in the Confederate Army, including brigadier general James Morrison Hawes; only three sons returned home from the war. On September 18, 1865, Hawes took an oath of allegiance to the United States, and was {{allowed to return to}} his previous career as a lawyer.|$|E

5|$|The {{flooding}} on Mangaia {{was regarded}} as the worst in almost 50years, as nearly the entire island was affected. According to locals, the ocean surrounding the island became red at one point due {{to the amount of}} soil being washed out to sea. Despite initial reports that the local water supply was contaminated, the International Federation of Red Cross And Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) stated that it <b>was</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> drink and there was a sufficient amount for all of the islands' 744 residents. Offshore, a sailboat was severely damaged by large swells produced by the storm and {{was on the verge of}} sinking. The sailor managed to secure the vessel and make it safely to shore.|$|E
5|$|Those {{with more}} serious {{injuries}} {{had to be}} carried down the track. The usual {{decision as to whether}} it <b>was</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> move someone was simplified by the Japanese, who killed all the wounded they encountered. Only those near death were abandoned. Casualties were held at the aid posts and dressing stations until they could walk, or the Japanese threatened. It took eight or ten Papuan carriers to move each man. Army stretchers rotted and fell apart; the Papuans improvised stretchers from blankets, copra bags and timber cut along the Track. The pace of the withdrawal was dictated by the rate at which casualties could be evacuated.|$|E
5|$|At 16:02, {{still waiting}} for a {{definitive}} report on {{the location of the}} Japanese fleet carriers, the U.S. carriers' radar detected the first incoming wave of Japanese strike aircraft. Fifty-three F4F-4 Wildcat fighters from the two U.S. carriers were directed by radar control towards the attackers. However, communication problems, limitations of the aircraft identification capabilities of the radar, primitive control procedures, and effective screening of the Japanese dive bombers by their escorting Zeros, prevented all {{but a few of the}} U.S. fighters from engaging the Vals before they began their attacks on the U.S. carriers. Just before the Japanese dive bombers began their attacks, Enterprise and Saratoga cleared their decks for the impending action by launching the aircraft that they had been holding ready in case the Japanese fleet carriers were sighted. These aircraft were told to fly north and attack anything they could find, or else to circle outside the battle zone, until it <b>was</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> return.|$|E

5|$|Halotus, as the Emperor's {{official}} taster, {{would probably}} have {{had a role in}} the plot, deceiving Claudius into believing the food <b>was</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> consume. He is a prime suspect because he would have had access to everything eaten by the Emperor on the night of his death. It has been suggested that Halotus may have been the murderer but was working under orders of Agrippina. While it is uncertain whether Halotus would have had anything to gain from the death of the Emperor, Agrippina's political and personal advantage gained by the death of her husband was evident; with Claudius dead, Nero, Agrippina's biological son, would be able to claim the throne. It was also known that the animosity between Agrippina and Claudius had grown during the months preceding the homicide. Other notable suspects included Locusta, a professional poisoner, and Xenophon, Claudius' royal physician, who, in line with the suggestion that the poison was not immediately fatal, is said to have carried an ailing Claudius out of the banquet, taken him to his room and forced a poisoned feather into his mouth on the pretence of encouraging him to regurgitate. Others say Xenophon used poisoned gruel.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{investigation}} {{noted that}} Great Lakes cargo vessels could normally avoid severe storms, {{and called for}} the establishment of a limiting sea state applicable to Great Lakes bulk cargo vessels. This would restrict the operation of vessels in sea states above the limiting value. One concern was that shipping companies pressured the captains to deliver cargo as quickly and cheaply as possible regardless of bad weather. At the time of Fitzgeralds foundering, there was no evidence that any governmental regulatory agency tried to control vessel movement in foul weather despite the historical record that hundreds of Great Lakes vessels had been wrecked in storms. The USCG took the position that only the captain could decide when it <b>was</b> <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> sail.|$|E

However, a commonly marketed product called [...] "black henna", <b>is</b> not <b>safe</b> <b>to</b> use because the product {{has been made}} by mixing natural henna with synthetic black dyes containing PPD, which can cause serious skin allergies, and should be avoided due to the substantial risk of serious injury.
