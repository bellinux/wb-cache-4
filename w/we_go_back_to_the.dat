It can be quite tricky. Sometimes we've had to change lines even when the filming is all finished. <b>We</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recording studio and put one line over another line. ... The only reason I reckon we've not been sued is because actually we've not said anything that technically we can't." [...] He said the series was [...] "well looked after" [...] by attorneys. In a 2009 interview with The Independent, Bishop recounted an experience when he gave a copy of the program to television producers in the United States: [...] "I gave some American producers the Star Stories DVD and those that could be bothered to watch it saw the Tom Cruise one. One guy went 'you can't do that it's Tom Cruise man? [...] 'yeah but you can't do that on TV' [...] 'what youâ€™re talking about Scientology, are you fucking nuts??

As soon as it is we must set out and make our way across to the land beyond it. We are sure to find some villages there and to get some sort of food after we've been down to the water. I vote <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wood and lie down in the shade there.
