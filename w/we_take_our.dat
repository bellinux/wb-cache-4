500|$|Due to OutKast's newfound {{commercial}} success and higher {{budget for the}} album, the group enjoyed a more relaxed schedule and [...] "could really just live" [...] at the studio. The duo and studio musicians {{lived and worked in}} the studio for weeks straight, with Big Boi noting, [...] "It usually takes us two to three years to make a record because <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>our</b> time; we ain't giving you that fast food, trying to meet a deadline. It ain't done until it's done sonically." [...] For Aquemini, the duo used live instrumentation and improvisation, bringing a baby grand piano into the studio and hiring musicians who played [...] "everything from stoner funk to prog rock". Producer Neal H. Pogue recalled, [...] "That was the beauty of making all those records – having musicians come in and out. It was almost like a Motown, that's what we had. Or like a Stax Records thing. That's what I loved about it. It brought back that whole feeling of making records. It was organic." [...] Much of the music on Aquemini was formulated during jam sessions, in which one musician would begin with creating a chord pattern and the rest would incorporate their instruments following that sequence. While recording Aquemini, André 3000 drew influence from reggae music and listened to Bob Marley constantly during the sessions. After the musical aspects of a song were developed, André 3000 and Big Boi would then create lyrics that they felt would fit with the tone of the song.|$|E

2500|$|According to Silver, {{the focus}} of FiveThirtyEight in its ESPN phase would broaden: [...] "People also think it’s {{going to be a}} sports site with a little {{politics}} thrown in, or it’s going to be a politics site with sports thrown in.... But <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>our</b> science and economics and lifestyle coverage very seriously.... It’s a data journalism site. Politics is one topic that sometimes data journalism is good at covering. It’s certainly good with presidential elections. But we don’t really see politics as how the site is going to grow".|$|E
2500|$|In {{each of our}} models, we {{calculate}} both hue {{and what}} this article will call chroma, after Joblove and Greenberg (1978), in the same way—that is, the hue of a color has the same numerical values {{in all of these}} models, as does its chroma. If <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>our</b> tilted RGB cube, and project it onto the [...] "chromaticity plane" [...] perpendicular to the neutral axis, our projection takes the shape of a hexagon, with red, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and magenta at its corners (...) [...] Hue is roughly the angle of the vector to a point in the projection, with red at 0°, while chroma is roughly the distance of the point from the origin.|$|E
2500|$|An armored brigade, {{under the}} command of Colonel Aryeh Keren, had set up its {{headquarters}} west of Suez. Keren {{was in charge of the}} attack and ordered Yossi Yoffe to lead the attack with his reserve paratroopers using nine captured Soviet APCs, and drive up the main street of the town. He said the confidence based on which he was being sent was groundless. He said he had only one small map and had seen no air photos and asked for time to draw a plan. Adan pressured Keren to capture Suez before the arrival of the observers, and Keren told Yoffe that [...] "in the armored corps, <b>we</b> <b>take</b> <b>our</b> orders while we're on the move", and gave thirty minutes to organize. A tank battalion, {{under the command}} of Lieutenant-Colonel Nahum Zaken was to lead the attack with its own infantry detachment, while Yoffe was to follow and leave platoons to secure the intersections.|$|E
