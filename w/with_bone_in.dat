Ivory rods, carved antlers, painted animal skulls, and other objects were buried with tribal leaders at caves in Somerset and Derbyshire. Later, around 2400BCE (BC), a group of peoples from mainland Europe known as Beaker folk conquered most of Britain. This warrior race had a tradition of investing their new leaders with polished ceremonial axes made of green quartzite, red tourmaline, and jadeite. Excavations at Bush Barrow, Wiltshire, unearthed an early example of a sceptre, decorated <b>with</b> <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> a zig-zag pattern, and topped by a stone. Archaeologists believe it and other treasures found in the grave may have belonged to the ruling family who built Stonehenge. By 1600 BCE, the rulers of southern Britain wore gold epaulettes, gold brooches, and gold-plated bronze daggers. A ceremonial gold cloak of the same period, the Mold cape, was found at a Bronze Age burial mound in Flintshire, Wales, in 1833.|$|E

40|$|Background: Breast {{cancer is}} the second leading cause of cancer-related death in women in the United States. During the {{advanced}} stages of disease, many breast cancer patients suffer from bone metastasis. These metastases are predominantly osteolytic and develop when tumor cells interact <b>with</b> <b>bone.</b> <b>In</b> vivo models that mimic the breast cancer-specific osteolytic bone microenvironment are limited. Previously, we developed a mouse model of tumor-bone interaction in which three mouse breast cancer cell lines were implanted onto the calvaria. Analysis of tumors from this model revealed that they exhibited strong bone resorption, induction of osteoclasts and intracranial penetration at the tumor bone (TB) -interface. Methods: In this study, we identified and used a TB microenvironment-specific gene expression signature from this model to extend {{our understanding of the}} metastatic bone microenvironment in human disease and to predict potential therapeutic targets. Results: We identified a TB signature consisting of 934 genes that were commonly (among our 3 cell lines) and specifically (as compared to tumor-alone area within the bone microenvironment) up- and down-regulated> 2 -fold at the TB interface in our mouse osteolytic model.

40|$|Loosening of the prosthesis, an {{important}} cause of clinical failure following total joint replacement, {{may be due}} to faulty implantation of the prosthesis, to trauma, or to infection in the tissues adjacent to the implant. Cases of loosening exist, however, in which the technique of implantation appears to have been satisfactory, {{in which there is no}} history of injury and in which there is no evidence by conventional criteria of the presence of infection. It will be argued in this paper that at least some of these cases {{may be due to}} sensitivity of the tissues to one of the metals in the alloy of which the prosthesis is composed. With one exception, all the patients described had prostheses implanted in which both components were composed of cobalt-chrome alloy. We believe that the problem of metal sensitivity is likely to be most important with implants of this kind but that it may also occur when an alloy articulates <b>with</b> <b>bone.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, we believe that the problem is least important when either cobalt-chrome alloy or stainless steel is articulated with high density polyethylene.

40|$|Compromised {{skeletal}} {{status is}} a frequent finding in patients with Crohn’s disease (CD), leading to increased fracture risk. Low body weight is associated with bone mineral density (BMD) in CD, although {{the relative importance of}} its components, lean and fat mass, is unclear. Muscle strength is also a predictor of BMD in nondiseased populations; however, its association <b>with</b> <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> CD is unknown. We examined the independent effects of body composition and muscle strength on regional and whole-body BMD in a cohort of CD patients. Sixty men and women, aged 22 – 72 years, with disease duration of 13 ± 7 years, underwent scanning of the spine, hip, forearm, and whole-body BMD by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Lean tissue, appendicular muscle mass (AMM), and fat mass were derived by DXA and grip strength by dynamometry. Medical history, medication usage, clinical variables, and nutritional intake were obtained by questionnaire. Prevalence of osteopenia and osteoporosis was 32 and 17 %, respectively, with osteopenia more common at the hip and osteoporosis more common at the spine. In multiple regression analyses, AMM was an independent predictor of whole-body and regional BMD whereas lean mass was an independent predictor at the hip. Neither grip strength nor fat mass was independently associated with BMD. Of the components of body composition, muscle mass was strongly associated with regional and whole-body BMD. Preserving or augmenting muscle mass in this population may be a useful strategy to preserve BMD and thereby reduce fracture risk...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDental {{implants}} are {{in general}} made of titanium, since this material promotes {{a stable and}} functional connection between the bone and {{the surface of the}} implant. Efforts produced during the chewing cycles may interfere with this union, affecting the process of osseointegration and eventually compromising the stability of the implant. Given the difficulty in working <b>with</b> <b>bone</b> <b>in</b> vivo, in the present study two implant systems were inserted in polymer samples, known as Sawbones, which simulate the structure of trabecular bone. The performance of the implants was evaluated through experimental fatigue tests. The qualitative analysis of the damage {{in the structure of the}} samples was performed using scanning electron microscope images. Determination and comparison of stress fields and deformations at the Sawbone-implant interface using an analytical model of indentation and the finite element method (FEM) to model indentation and penetration were undertaken. The experimental results showed that the performance of the Morse taper implant was greater than the external hexagonal implant when both were tested cyclically in samples of different densities. It was shown that the diameter, length, density and type of implant-abutment interface affected the behaviour of the implants. The numerical results of indentation model were very similar to those obtained by the analytical model. The results of the FEM penetration model had the same tendency as the experimental values and the indentation analysis with increasing the density of the polymer foam. It could be concluded that, as in foams, the increase of the bone density will induce an increased stability to the implants...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the synergetic influence of surface topography and chemical composition of oral implant materials on bone response. For the experiment screw designed implants were used. The implants were grit-blasted with TiO 2 particles. The implants were left uncoated (Ti) or provided with three different amorphous/crystalline Ca-P magnetron sputter coatings, resp. 0. 1 micron (CaP- 0. 1), 1 micron (CaP- 1) and 4 microns (CaP- 4), in thickness. The implants were inserted in the medial femoral condyles of 12 goats. Each femur received 2 implants. After implantation periods of 6 and 12 weeks the implants were retrieved and prepared for histological and histomorphometrical evaluation (bone contact and bone mass). The light microscopy revealed that bone response to CaP- 4 and CaP- 1 implants was similar. For example, after 12 weeks, screw threads were almost completely covered <b>with</b> <b>bone.</b> <b>In</b> contrast to CaP- 0. 1 and Ti implants, where bone apposition was less pronounced. Histomorphometry demonstrated that the bone-to-implant contact for the CaP- 1 and CaP- 4 implants was significantly higher (P < 0. 05) than for the CaP- 0. 1 and Ti implants. This difference existed already after 6 weeks and was even enhanced after 12 weeks. The bone mass measurements revealed that only at 12 weeks CaP- 4 implants had significantly more bone contact inside the screw threads than non-coated Ti-implants (P < 0. 05). Supported by our findings, we conclude that the additional application of a 1 - 4 microns thick Ca-P magnetron sputter coating can further improve the healing response to surface roughened oral implants placed into trabecular bone. status: publishe...|$|E
30|$|Continued {{focus on}} {{materials}} development and novel methods of prophylactic antibiotic administration may provide insights {{that can be}} tested further in human clinical trials. Specifically, efforts are being made to produce an improved pin coating that has antimicrobial properties. This would have implications for external fixation but would revolutionize internal fixation for use over a site of previous pin use and for routine use as a prophylactic measure against infection. The findings of Chou et al. [9] are intriguing; topical pexiganan acetate applied to pin sites resulted in a 75  % decrease in pin site infections in a rabbit model. DeJong et al. [13] found that the pin site infection rate was significantly decreased by adding a coating of chlorhexidine, hydroxyapatite, and lipid to titanium and stainless steel pins implanted into goat tibiae. The coated pins had a 4.2  % infection rate and 12.5  % colonization rate at 14  days after inoculating the pin sites with S. aureus, {{in contrast to the}} 100  % infection rate in the uncoated pins (p <  0.01). Although the extraction torque of the coated pins decreased over the 14 -day study period, it was superior to the uncoated pins. These results suggest that this coating may be a viable option {{to reduce the risk of}} infection while maintaining a stable interface <b>with</b> <b>bone.</b> <b>In</b> an in vitro study by Chen et al. [8], a silver-containing HA pin coating was shown to decrease S. aureus and S. epidermidis adhesion in comparison with plain titanium pins without increased cytotoxicity to precursor osteoblast cells.
