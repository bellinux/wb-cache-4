30|$|The {{variation}} of enzyme concentration and reaction time on conversion yield {{is shown in}} Fig.  2 c. At lower enzyme concentration, initial conversion yields for mango oil were {{greater than that of}} neem up to about 20  h reaction time. After 20  h that of shea oil was greater than that of mango oil. At high enzyme concentrations conversion yields increased with reaction time and attained steady values for both mango and shea oils. Conversion yields were higher for shea oils compared to mango and neem oils. Variation of conversion yields for neem oils under these conditions was not significant. Maximum yields for shea oils were obtained at the highest enzyme concentration. At prolonged reaction times, conversion yields decreased probably due to aggregation of enzymes after long reaction times.

The serious separation between powders and binder occurs in the region of die wall, vertex, and area below the inlet in the sample, leading to non-homogeneous shrinkage during sintering, and these regions need to pay more attentions. As the increase of the injection rate, the volume of low fluctuation region increases firstly, and reaches a maximum value when the injection rate is 70 cm 3 /s, then decreases. The change trend and fluctuation range of the distribution curves of powder volume fraction are fitted with the CT test results, so the reliability of simulating results is demonstrated...|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe photophysical {{properties}} of near-infrared (NIR) emissive aza-boron-dipyrromethene (aza-BDP) dyes incorporating nitrofluorene and alkoxy decorations were intensively investigated. Their highly reversible one-electron reduction process showed characteristic electrofluorochromic (EF) {{properties in the}} NIR range, depending on the substituents. The nitrofluorene ethynyl-substituted (Type I) dyes showed smaller EF effects than the alkoxy-containing (Type II) dyes because {{of the difference in}} their intrinsic fluorescence contrast between the neutral and reduced states (radical anion). In addition, the Type II chromophores showed a larger diffusion coefficient for ion transport, which enhanced the EF contrast and the response time for the fluorescence change at a given step potential. With an optimized condition, the NIR EF ON/OFF ratio reached a value of 6. 1 and a long cyclability over 1000 EF cycles between - 0. 4 [*]V and + 0. 4 [*]V switching potentials, with approximately 20 % loss of the initial ON/OFF switching ratio.

The 10 fuels investigated included hydrocarbons of the paraffin olefin, naphthene, and aromatic classes having a boiling range from 113 degrees to 655 degrees F. They were hot-acid octane, diisobutylene, methylcyclohexane, benzene, xylene, 62 -octane gasoline, kerosene, solvent 2, and Diesel fuel oil.

40|$|Recent {{results from}} a three-year multi-disciplinary project on Ancient Egyptian gold {{jewellery}} revealed that items of jewellery from the Middle Kingdom to the New Kingdom were manufactured {{using a variety of}} alluvial gold alloys. These alloys cover a wide range of colours and the majority contain Platinum Group Elements inclusions. However, in all the gold foils analysed, these inclusions were found to be absent. In this work a selection of gilded wood and leather items and gold foil fragments, all from the excavations by John Garstang at Abydos (primarily from Middle Kingdom graves), were examined using Scanning Electron Microscopy-Energy Disperse Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), X-Ray Fluorescence (µXRF), Particle Induced X-Ray Emission (µPIXE) and Double Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence (D 2 XRF).

40|$|Background: Several MYB genes {{belonging}} to R 2 R 3 MYB transcription {{factors have been}} used in several plant species to enhance anthocyanin production, and have shown various expression or regulation patterns. This study focused on the effect of ectopic expression of an RsMYB 1 isolated from radish (Raphanus sativa) on chrysanthemum cv. ‘Shinma’. Results: The RT-PCR results confirmed that RsMYB 1 regulated the expression of three key biosynthetic genes (CmF 3 H, CmDFR, and CmANS) that are responsible for anthocyanin production in transgenic chrysanthemum, but were not detected in the non-transgenic line. In all transgenic plants, higher expression levels of key biosynthetic genes were observed in flowers than in leaves. However, the presence of RsMYB 1 in chrysanthemum did not affect any morphological characteristics, such as plant height, leaf shape or size, and number of flowers. Furthermore, no anthocyanin accumulation <b>was</b> <b>visually</b> <b>observed</b> in the leaves and floral tissue of any of the transgenic lines, which was further confirmed by anthocyanin content estimation.

The mortars were immersed in a solution of 5 % Na 2 SO 4 at 5 degrees C. 10 degrees C and 20 degrees C for 1 year and the caused deterioration <b>was</b> <b>visually</b> <b>observed</b> on a regular basis. The deterioration product {{on the surface of}} the mortars has been identified as thaumasite by means of XRD, FT-IR, DTG and SEM/EDAX analyses. Mortars immersed in a solution of 5 % Na 2 SO 4 at 10 degrees C for a year suffered limited surface damage, which was identified as thaumasite formation and carbonation. Similar damage appeared for mortars immersed in a solution of 5 % Na 2 SO 4 at 5 degrees C for 6 months and that led to the conclusion that thaumasite formation is related inversely to the conservation temperature of the mortars. Finally, mortars immersed in a solution of 5 % Na 2 SO 4 at 20 degrees C for a year were intact and thaumasite could not be identified. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
