Interviews, observations, and document analysis are used to explore <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> design and practices of a nature preschool reflect 3 - 5 year olds' capacities for knowing and learning. The author considers how these reflections are relevant to social justice education scholarship, Social Reproduction Theory, reflective inquiry pedagogies literature, and current early child development research. Research findings indicate five <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> nature preschool's design and practices support parallels to social justice education...|$|R

5|$|Traditionally, Pre-Columbian Aztec {{writing has}} not been {{considered}} a true writing system, since it did not represent the full vocabulary of a spoken language in the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> writing systems of the Old World or the Maya Script did. Therefore, generally Aztec writing {{was not meant to}} be read, but to be told. The elaborate codices were essentially pictographic aids for memorizing texts, which include genealogies, astronomical information, and tribute lists. Three kinds of signs were used in the system: pictures used as mnemonics (which do not represent particular words), logograms which represent whole words (instead of phonemes or syllables), and logograms used only for their sound values (i.e. used according to the rebus principle). However, epigrapher Alfonso Lacadena has argued that by the eve of the Spanish invasion, one school of Nahua scribes, those of Tetzcoco, had developed a fully syllabic script which could represent spoken language phonetically in the same <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Maya script did. Some other epigraphers have questioned the claim, arguing that although the syllabicity was clearly extant in some early colonial manuscripts (hardly any pre-Columbian manuscripts have survived), this could be interpreted as a local innovation inspired by Spanish literacy rather than a continuation of a pre-Columbian practice.|$|E

5|$|A matroid is a {{mathematical}} structure in which certain sets of elements are defined to be independent, {{in such a}} <b>way</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> independent sets satisfy properties modeled after the properties of linear independence in a vector space. One of the standard examples of a matroid is the graphic matroid in which the independent sets are the sets of edges in forests of a graph; the matroid structure of forests is important in algorithms for computing the minimum spanning tree of the graph. Analogously, we may define matroids from pseudoforests.|$|E
5|$|A recent {{development}} {{is the use of}} the RDS system of car radios.

This feature is built into every RDS radio for use in national emergency broadcast systems, but short range units on emergency vehicles can prove an effective means of alerting traffic to their presence. It is, however, unlikely that this system could replace audible warnings, as it is unable to alert pedestrians, those not using a compatible radio or even have it turned off.|$|E
