5|$|A {{scheme to}} cover the moors with ash from {{coal-fired}} power stations, and possibly municipal rubbish, was proposed in 1962, and again in 1969. Another plan of the 1960s <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a regional airport on the moors; this proposal was revived in 1971. Further ash-tipping schemes were voiced in 1974, as was a third plan for an airport in 1976. There were also {{plans to use the}} moor as a dump for colliery waste in 1978, when Thorne Colliery was upgraded and reopened.|$|E
5|$|Acting on a 1942 {{initiative}} by Chief Scout Lord Somers, {{a formal}} Baden-Powell House Committee {{was established by}} The Scout Association in 1953 {{under the direction of}} Sir Harold Gillett, later Lord Mayor of London. The committee's directive <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a hostel to provide Scouts a place to stay at reasonable cost while visiting London. For this purpose, in 1956 the committee purchased a bombed-out property at the intersection of Cromwell Road and Queen's Gate at a cost of £39,000.|$|E
5|$|As the 19th century progressed, the {{increasing}} need for large freight carriers led to Liverpool's dominance as a port. Manchester became increasingly reliant on its Merseyside neighbour for its imports and exports, but the handling charges and dues {{charged by the}} Mersey Docks and Harbour Board made goods from Manchester uncompetitive. A solution <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> the Manchester Ship Canal. In 1887 the Bridgewater Navigation Company was purchased by the Manchester Ship Canal Company with a cheque for £1,710,000, which {{was at the time}} the largest cheque ever written, and the building of the Manchester Ship Canal began.|$|E

5|$|As the new {{residential}} area suffered from aircraft noise, residents {{joined in the}} demand that the airport be relocated. Despite this, the number of flights to the airport increased as the newly formed Israel Airports Authority strived to reduce congestion at Ben Gurion Airport by shifting all domestic turbo-prop flights to Sde Dov. Once again, the only feasible alternative proposed at this point <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a runway in the sea and again, {{the high cost of}} this project meant that it never happened. This was a large issue in the area during the whole of the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Before his death, Henry {{instructed}} the coachman to gather his remaining body parts in a cloth tied with blue string, {{place it in}} a cart drawn by a stallion. When the stallion broke, he was {{to replace it with}} an ox, and when the ox stopped, he <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a church. This is where Henrik’s remains were to be buried.|$|E
5|$|By 1285, Caernarfon's town {{walls were}} mostly complete. At {{the same time}} work {{continued}} on the castle. Spending on construction was negligible from 1289 and accounts end in 1292. EdwardI's campaign of castle-building in Wales cost £80,000 between 1277 and 1304, and £95,000 between 1277 and 1329; by 1292 £12,000 had been spent {{on the construction of}} Caernarfon's castleof which the southern facade was furthest alongand town walls. As the southern wall and town walls completed a defensive circuit around Caernarfon, the plan <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> the castle's northern facade last.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} early church {{settlement}} at Llanbadarn Fawr was comparatively successful and well-endowed, {{it is unlikely that}} significant building work was done. The clas church would continue to reflect a strong Celtic form for many years. But even though St Augustine, first Archbishop of Canterbury, failed to extend his authority to the Christians in Wales and Dumnonia {{at the beginning of the}} seventh century, the influence of the western church was to begin to be gradually felt. However, even then, the tendency in west Wales <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> larger and larger single cell churches, rather than adopt the newly fashionable basilican design.|$|E
5|$|From its {{establishment}} in 1967 to its abolition in 1992, the Milton Keynes Development Corporation created {{by far the}} largest and most ambitious of the British new towns: indeed its objective <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a new city of 250,000 people. Many of Britain's most acclaimed building and landscape architects contributed to what was to be a show-piece of British design. Unlike previous new towns, Milton Keynes has a preponderance of privately funded development but these developments were subject to an exacting design brief in line with the design principles laid out in The Plan for Milton Keynes.|$|E

In 2005, Jackson sponsored a bill for the creation and acquisition of a life-size statue of Rosa Parks to be placed in Statuary Hall at the United States Capitol. The bill approving the funding for the statue was signed by President Bush on December 1, 2005. Jackson was active in funding AIDS service organizations that serve blacks through Congress.|$|E

5|$|Lakefront Station's lack of {{modernization}} since its opening {{has become more}} noticeable, especially its appearance and lack of adequate signage. In August 2012, when the Huntington Convention Center of Cleveland was under construction, a Cuyahoga County official {{expressed a desire to}} keep Lakefront Station out of view. One proposed solution <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a new station underground, but {{due to a lack of}} funding, the county settled on hiding the station behind trees and shrubs as a short-term solution.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the convent}} school {{was small and}} only temporary, the next order of {{business}} <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> the actual school. The parochial school took ten years to build (1950–1960). This building also consists of three floors and is covered with red sandstone in the front. The rear of the building is made of white Pennsylvania sandstone. There is a bell tower on the building. It has three heavy, bronze bells that were salvaged from three Protestant churches of Pittsburgh.|$|E
5|$|The Red Bull Air Race was {{conceived}} in 2001 in the Red Bull sports think-tank {{which has been}} responsible for creating a range of new sports events across the world. The aim was to develop a new aviation race that would challenge the ability of the world's best pilots, creating a race in the sky that was not simply about speed, but also precision and skill. The answer <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a specially designed obstacle course which the pilots would navigate at high speeds.|$|E

5|$|The founders' {{ambition}} <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> {{an orchestra}} {{the equal of}} any European or American rival. Between 1932 and the Second World War the LPO was widely judged to have succeeded in this regard. After the outbreak of war the orchestra's private backers withdrew and the players reconstituted the LPO as a self-governing cooperative. In the post-war years the orchestra faced challenges from two new rivals; the Philharmonia and the Royal Philharmonic, founded respectively in 1946 and 1947, achieved a quality of playing not matched by the older orchestras, including the LPO.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} plan conceived by Alléon de Valcourt in 1749 <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a canal that would link the upper Loire to the Rhone. The route would {{run through the}} Gier basin from Givors on the Rhone {{most of the way}} to Saint-Étienne, then through the Saint-Étienne basin to Saint-Just on the Loire. It was sometimes called the Canal des Deux-Mers (Two-Seas Canal) since it would link the Atlantic and the Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The regime {{promoted}} {{the concept of}} Volksgemeinschaft, a national German ethnic community. The goal <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a classless society based on racial purity and the perceived need to prepare for warfare, conquest and a struggle against Marxism. The German Labour Front founded the Kraft durch Freude (KdF; Strength Through Joy) organisation in 1933. In addition to taking control {{of tens of thousands}} of previously privately run recreational clubs, it offered highly regimented holidays and entertainment such as cruises, vacation destinations and concerts.|$|E

5|$|The {{response}} towards {{more effective}} cannons <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> thicker walls and to prefer round towers, as the curving sides {{were more likely}} to deflect a shot than a flat surface. While this sufficed for new castles, pre-existing structures {{had to find a way}} to cope with being battered by cannon. An earthen bank could be piled behind a castle's curtain wall to absorb some of the shock of impact.|$|E
5|$|Before 1854, {{the area}} based around Bridgeton {{was a strong}} {{business}} and legal section in Cape May County. The local residents there, however, {{wanted to have a}} strong banking industry, but a local named Richard Holmes along with several other locals turned to the strong type of enterprise, a turnpike company. Holmes and the locals began a local turnpike syndicate with other businessmen and began the Cape May Turnpike Company upon incorporation in 1854. The turnpike company, upon incorporation, <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a toll road along roughly the U.S. Route 9 corridor. Progress in constructing the toll road was slow at first, with subscribers from Cape May County being hesitant to buy stock from the turnpike company. A friend of Richard Holmes, Wilmon Whilldin, owned a steamboat company in Cape May and apologized for not buying stock in the company. Citing the Panic of 1857 made it hard to convert securities to cash, Whilldin suggested that a steamboat would be more profitable than the turnpike. The money from the steamboat would go ahead and helped the financially depressed businesses in local communities.|$|E
5|$|Bernard Lovell {{built the}} Transit Telescope at Jodrell Bank {{in the late}} 1940s. This was a -diameter radio {{telescope}} that could only point directly upwards; {{the next logical step}} <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>build</b> a telescope that could look at all parts of the sky so that more sources could be observed, as well as for longer integration times. Although the Transit Telescope had been designed and constructed by the astronomers that used it, a fully steerable telescope would need to be professionally designed and constructed; the first challenge was to find an engineer willing to do the job. This turned out to be Charles Husband, whom Lovell first met on 8 September 1949.|$|E
