5|$|Monsanto {{developed}} patents for {{genetically modified}} soybeans that were resistant to glyphosate-based herbicides. When farmers sprayed the modified soybeans with the glyphosate herbicide Roundup, the modified soybeans would survive while competing plants (weeds) <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed.</b> Monsanto sold these soybeans under a limited-use license that prohibited the farmer-buyer {{from using the}} seeds {{for more than a}} single season or from saving any seed produced from the crop for replanting.|$|E

5|$|The war {{was still}} ongoing, and since {{transporting}} masses of {{people into a}} combat zone was impossible, Heydrich decided that the Jews currently living in the General Government (the German-occupied area of Poland) <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> in extermination camps set up in occupied areas of Poland, as would Jews {{from the rest of}} Europe.|$|E
5|$|When Black's car is searched, it {{is clear}} it was never rigged with anything—Dees had planned the whole thing, knowing that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed.</b> As news reports spread {{concerning}} the bomber's identity and his death {{at the hands of}} the police, Black sees that Dees has achieved the fame he longed for.|$|E
5|$|According to Njal's saga, Bróðir {{tried by}} sorcery {{to predict the}} outcome of the battle against Brian. He augured that if the battle were on Good Friday, King Brian would fall but win the battle; but if they fought on any day before, all who opposed Brian <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed.</b> Brian was unwilling to fight on Good Friday, as he would not fight on a fast day, but the Danes forced the battle to the Friday, which fell that year on 23 April.|$|E

5|$|Another {{instance}} of population control is {{the prevalence of}} female infanticide. People in rural areas practiced female infanticide and selective neglect due to a preference of sons over daughters. Since the 1980s, roughly 200,000 female infants <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> per {{year because of the}} preference for male children and the advancement in technologies such as ultrasound, which help to find out the sex of the fetus. In addition to female infanticide, girls are being unregistered or are abandoned by their families, which stops them from receiving education and legal benefits the government offered. These methods of controlling population have resulted in a huge gender gap in China.|$|E
5|$|Both Schlesselman and Cowart {{acknowledged}} that they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> {{as a result}} of the murders and insisted they were willing to die. Authorities said the pair planned to break into a gun shop to steal more weapons for their attack, and also bought nylon rope and ski masks at Walmart to use in a robbery or home invasion to fund the spree. Schlesselman and Cowart asked a friend to drive them to a house they planned to rob, but they cancelled the robbery after getting scared by a dog and two vehicles in the driveway.|$|E
5|$|In 1890 William H. McCudden and Amelia Byford (1869–1955) married.

5|$|Norgrove's captors {{demanded the}} release of Aafia Siddiqui in {{exchange}} for her return. The Taliban released the three Afghans on 3 October 2010 during negotiations. The United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group conducted a predawn rescue attempt five days later on the Taliban mountain hideout where Norgrove was held captive, amid concerns that she <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> or moved by her kidnappers. US forces killed several kidnappers and three local farmers during the assault. They subsequently located Norgrove, badly wounded in a nearby gully, and she died later from her injuries.|$|E
5|$|Plans for {{the total}} {{eradication}} of the Jewish population of Europe—eleven million people—were formalized at the Wannsee Conference on 20 January 1942. Some would be worked to death and the rest <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed.</b> Initially the victims were killed with gas vans or by Einsatzgruppen firing squads, but these methods proved impracticable for an operation of this scale. By 1942, killing centers at Auschwitz, Sobibór, Treblinka, and other Nazi extermination camps replaced Einsatzgruppen as the primary method of mass killing.|$|E

5|$|Surviving {{records show}} that the German claimants {{included}} Staffelkapitän Hauptmann Theodor Rossiwall and Oberleutnant Sophus Baagoe who were credited with kills against Hurricanes, taking their scores to 12 and 14 respectively. Baagoe <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> in action within a month, on 14 May 1941. It cannot be known for certain which one shot down Pattle since three other German pilots made claims in the air battle. One of the 80 Squadron pilots involved in the battle, Roald Dahl, records five Hurricanes were downed in several air battles that day, with four pilots dying. One of those was Pattle.|$|E
5|$|By 1969, Clarence13X {{became very}} tired and slept little. He feared that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> and {{instructed}} {{his followers to}} remain strong if he died. On June12, he spent time with several of his disciples at their school. He left the school between 2:00 and 3:00 am on June 13 and then gambled {{for an hour or}} two. As was his occasional practice, he traveled to Dora Smith's house to rest. He was ambushed by three assailants who fatally shot him {{while he was in the}} lobby of her apartment building. That morning, several people from the mayor's office met with his family, and the mayor later visited the Five Percenters' school to express condolences.|$|E
5|$|In 1848, Sarmiento voluntarily left to Chile once again. During {{the same}} year, he met widow Benita Martínez Pastoriza, married her, and adopted her son, Domingo Fidel, or Dominguito, who <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> in action during the War of the Triple Alliance at Curupaytí in 1866. Sarmiento {{continued}} {{to exercise the}} idea of {{freedom of the press}} and began two new periodicals entitled La Tribuna and La Crónica respectively, which strongly attacked Juan Manuel de Rosas. During this stay in Chile, Sarmiento's essays became more strongly opposed to Juan Manuel de Rosas. The Argentine government tried to have Sarmiento extradited from Chile to Argentina, but the Chilean government refused to hand him over.|$|E

5|$|In 1889, Pilcher married Kathleen Mary Gonne, {{daughter}} of Colonel Thomas Gonne of the 17th Lancers; her sister, Maude Gonne, {{later became a}} prominent Irish nationalist and mother of the politician and Nobel laureate Seán MacBride, {{as well as a}} close associate and muse of W. B. Yeats. Pilcher disapproved of his sister-in-law, particularly after her marriage to John MacBride, and relations were frequently strained; however, the two sisters remained close. The couple would have a daughter, Thora, and three sons – Toby, Tommy, and Pat. The elder son, Gonne ("Toby", to his family), became a Judge of the High Court of Justice, while Tommy <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle in 1915, aged 21.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{returned}} home when his state {{took up the}} issue of secession. His successor as governor, Isham G. Harris, and the legislature, organized a referendum on whether to have a constitutional convention to authorize secession; when that failed, they put the question of leaving the Union to a popular vote. Despite threats on Johnson's life, and actual assaults, he campaigned against both questions, sometimes speaking with a gun on the lectern before him. Although Johnson's eastern region of Tennessee was largely against secession, the second referendum passed, and in June 1861, Tennessee joined the Confederacy. Believing he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> if he stayed, Johnson fled through the Cumberland Gap, where his party was in fact shot at. He left his wife and family in Greeneville.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} fifteen days the fleet {{followed}} the coastline west, and then south. The expedition was now perilously short of fresh water, and shore parties searching for water were left dangerously exposed because the ships could not pull {{close to the}} shore due to the shallows. On 23 February 1517, the Spanish spotted the Maya city of Campeche. A large contingent put ashore to fill their water casks. They were approached by about fifty finely dressed and unarmed Indians while the water was being loaded into the boats; they questioned the Spaniards as to their purpose by means of signs. The Spanish party then accepted an invitation to enter the city. Once inside the city, the Maya leaders {{made it clear that}} the Spanish <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>killed</b> if they did not withdraw immediately. The Spanish party retreated in defensive formation to the safety of the ships.|$|E
