40|$|Background:High impact {{physical}} activity (PA) {{is thought to}} improve skeletal health, but its relation to other health outcomes are unclear. We investigated associations between PA impact magnitude and body mass index (BMI) in older adults. Methods:Data {{were taken from the}} Cohort for Skeletal Health in Bristol and Avon (COSHIBA), Hertfordshire Cohort Study, and MRC National Survey of Health and Development. Vertical acceleration peaks from 7 -day hip-worn accelerometer recordings were used to classify PA as low (0. 5 < g < 1. 0 g), medium (1 < g < 1. 5 g), or higher (≥ 1. 5 g) impact. Cohort-specific associations of low, medium, and higher impact PA with BMI were examined using linear regressions and estimates combined using random-effects meta-analysis. Results:A total of 1182 participants (mean age = 72. 7 years, 68 % female) were included. Low, medium, and higher impact PA <b>were</b> <b>inversely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> BMI in initial models. After adjustment for confounders and other impacts, low, but not medium or higher, impacts <b>were</b> <b>inversely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> BMI (− 0. 31, p <. 001 : overall combined standard deviation change in BMI per doubling in the number of low impacts). In adjusted analyses of body composition measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in COSHIBA, low, but not medium or higher, impacts <b>were</b> <b>inversely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> total body fat mass (− 0. 19, p <. 001) and android:gynoid fat mass ratio (− 0. 16, p =. 01), whereas high impact PA was weakly and positively associated with lean mass (0. 05, p =. 06). Conclusions:Greater exposure to PA producing low magnitude vertical impacts was associated with lower BMI and fat mass at older age. Low impact PA may help reduce obesity risk in older adults. </p...|$|E
40|$|An {{examination}} of the relationships among undergraduate women's self-esteem, perceptions of the campus environment, and women's identity attitudes (i. e., attitudes about, and identification with, women and the sociopolitical issues unique to women) was conducted. 649 female undergraduates, freshman through seniors, were surveyed in classes at the University of Maryland, College Park campus. Results indicated that Encounter (characterized by rejection of previously held stereotypical views about women and heightened awareness about the sociopolitical issues unique to women) and Immersion-Emersion (characterized by active rejection of male supremacist values and beliefs) attitudes were positively related to perceptions of gender bias in the campus environment and inversely related to self-esteem. Internalization (chararacterized by acceptance and pride in one's women's identity) attitudes <b>were</b> <b>inversely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> perceptions of environmental gender bias and positively related to self-esteem. Perceptions of gender bias <b>were</b> <b>inversely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> self-esteem, indicating that the more negatively one viewed oneself the more likely one was to perceive the campus environment as biased, or conversely that the more positively one viewed oneself the less likely one was to perceive inequities reflecting gender bias in the campus environment.

Sinusoidal curves for annual, lunar and tide cycles, and linear maximum tide height were fitted to logarithmically transformed data. Annual cycles accounted for 44 - 71 % of the between-day variation in catch of C. austropalpalis, C. cordiger, C. henryi, C. histrio, C. longior, C. marmoratus and C. subimmaculatus.

These traits were assessed {{in terms of their}} effect on breaking through the glass ceiling effect. Thirdly, organization’s commitment and its relevant effects on glass ceiling effect were assessed. Some of the factors that were looked under this were working full hours, annual gross income, number of years at work, and valuing one’s job.

The results show that there is no relationship between being a majority and White and breaking the glass ceiling effect.

40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to investigate the}} relationship between religiosity, alienation, and philosophy of human nature using a sample {{of students enrolled in}} a fundamental Bible college and students enrolled in a liberal arts college. Two additional preceding variables, socioeconomic status and religious socialization were included in the model as they were assumed to influence levels of alienation and religiosity respectively;The theoretical model suggested that higher levels of religiosity would be <b>related</b> <b>to</b> lower levels of personal alienation. Furthermore, as conservative, fundamental Christianity was of interest with its particular theological orientation (i. e., the belief in original sin), it was hypothesized that religiosity would be <b>related</b> <b>to</b> a cynical view of human nature as opposed to a more optimistic view;The theoretical model generated five general hypotheses. Of these five, three hypotheses were supported by the data: (1) Religious socialization will be positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> religiosity. (2) Religiosity will <b>be</b> <b>inversely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> alienation. (3) Religiosity will <b>be</b> <b>inversely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> the belief in goodness as philosophy of human nature and positively <b>related</b> <b>to</b> cynicism as philosophy of human nature;The two hypotheses which were not supported by the data were: (1) Socioeconomic status will <b>be</b> <b>inversely</b> <b>related</b> <b>to</b> alienation.
