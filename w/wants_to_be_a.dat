5|$|The story {{depicts a}} young student named Shuichi Nitori, {{described}} by the author as a transgender girl, and Shuichi's friend Yoshino Takatsuki, described as a transgender boy. The series deals with issues such as being transgender, gender identity, {{and the beginning of}} puberty. Shimura was originally going to write the story about a girl in high school who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> boy, but she realized that a boy who <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> girl before entering into puberty would have a lot of worries related to growing up, and changed the story to fit this model. Wandering Son was selected as a recommended work by the awards jury of the tenth Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006.
