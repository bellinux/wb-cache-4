5|$|As the Fragrant Hill project neared completion, Pei {{began work}} on the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in New York City, for which his {{associate}} James Freed served as lead designer. Hoping to create a vibrant community institution in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> run-down neighborhood on Manhattan's west side, Freed developed a glass-coated structure with an intricate space frame of interconnected metal rods and spheres.|$|E
5|$|It {{was first}} {{described}} by Brown & Kempf in 1968 {{based on two}} workers collected in a Berlese sample of humus in El Salvador. Due to morphological similarities, they considered it a very primitive ant {{and placed it in}} <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> myrmicine tribe, the Agroecomyrmecini, together with ants known from Early Eocene Baltic amber (Agroecomyrmex) and late Eocene Florissant shale (Eulithomyrmex).|$|E
5|$|On the ground, the Georgia Tech rushing {{attack was}} led by Tashard Choice. Choice was the leading rusher in the ACC, {{averaging}} over 100 yards per game. Against North Carolina State, Choice recorded 164 rushing yards on 34 carries, earning <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> single-game career high in rushing yards. In {{the days before the}} ACC championship, Choice was named to the second-team All-ACC team, and was considered to be a threat on offense against Wake Forest.|$|E

5|$|Tech quarterback Maurice DeShazo {{was also}} {{a major part of}} the record-breaking Tech offense. DeShazo threw 22 {{touchdown}} passes during the regular season, setting <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> school record. He completed 129 of 230passes for 2,080yards and seveninterceptions in addition to the touchdown record. DeShazo's favorite target passing the ball was wide receiver Antonio Freeman, who set a Tech record with nine touchdown receptions during the regular season. Freeman caught 32passes for 644yards in addition to the touchdown mark.|$|E
5|$|The Association {{objected to}} the American {{retailer}} Abercrombie & Fitch's plan to open a children's store at 3 Savile Row, concerned that chain stores entering the street would drive up rents, and took part in, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>then,</b> <b>a</b> successful protest in 2012.

5|$|The film's first {{telecast}} {{took place}} on Sunday, February 14, 1971. In <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> television first for a Hollywood film, it was broadcast over five hours (including commercials) during a single evening by CBS, preempting all of that network's regular programming for that one evening. It was watched by 85.82 million people for a 37.1 average rating. It {{was one of the}} highest rated movies ever screened on television at the time (behind the broadcast premiere of Bridge on the River Kwai).|$|E

5|$|By the mid-1990s, {{the debt}} markets were {{improving}} and KKR {{had moved on}} from the RJR Nabisco buyout. In 1996, KKR was able to complete the bulk of fundraising for <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> record $6 billion private equity fund, the KKR 1996 Fund. However, KKR was still burdened by {{the performance of the}} RJR investment and repeated obituaries in the media. KKR was required by its investors to reduce the fees it charged and to calculate its carried interest based on the total profit of the fund (i.e., offsetting losses from failed deals against the profits from successful deals).|$|E
5|$|For {{decades after}} the {{discovery}} of GRBs, astronomers searched for a counterpart at other wavelengths: i.e., any astronomical object in positional coincidence with a recently observed burst. Astronomers considered many distinct classes of objects, including white dwarfs, pulsars, supernovae, globular clusters, quasars, Seyfert galaxies, and BL Lac objects. All such searches were unsuccessful, {{and in a few}} cases particularly well-localized bursts (those whose positions were determined with <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> high degree of accuracy) could be clearly shown to have no bright objects of any nature consistent with the position derived from the detecting satellites. This suggested an origin of either very faint stars or extremely distant galaxies. Even the most accurate positions contained numerous faint stars and galaxies, and it was widely agreed that final resolution of the origins of cosmic gamma-ray bursts would require both new satellites and faster communication.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, Tivadar Puskás got Tesla {{another job}} in Paris with the Continental Edison Company. Tesla began working in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> brand new industry, {{installing}} indoor incandescent lighting citywide {{in the form}} of an electric power utility. The company had several subdivisions and Tesla worked at the Société Electrique Edison, the division in the Ivry-sur-Seine suburb of Paris in charge of installing the lighting system. There he gained a great deal of practical experience in electrical engineering. Management took notice of his advanced knowledge in engineering and physics and soon had him designing and building improved versions of generating dynamos and motors. They also sent him on to troubleshoot engineering problems at other Edison utilities being built around France and in Germany.|$|E
50|$|On August 29, 1976, the Dominican Premier, Patrick Roland John, {{introduced}} {{the idea of}} independence to the nation.

5|$|In 1952 {{the company}} moved its Cardiff venue to the Sophia Gardens Pavilion (built for the Festival of Britain), with the Bournemouth Municipal Orchestra as the company's orchestra, {{replacing}} the previous ad hoc ensemble. The Pavilion was acoustically mediocre and lacked an orchestra pit; {{two years later}} the company moved again, to the New Theatre where it played Cardiff seasons across the next fifty years. The 1952 season attracted particular interest because it included <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> rarity: Verdi's Nabucco. The company built a reputation for staging seldom-seen Verdi works, including The Sicilian Vespers staged in the same year, I Lombardi in 1956, and The Battle of Legnano, under the shortened title The Battle, in 1960. The 1952 Nabucco was the WNO's first production for which costumes and scenery were specially designed (by Patrick Robertson) rather than hired.|$|E
5|$|The 2002 San Francisco Bowl was {{the final}} collegiate game of Tech running back Lee Suggs, whose twotouchdowns allowed him to finish his collegiate career with 336points, the second-most career points scored by {{a player in the}} Big East. Suggs also {{extended}} his NCAA-record streak of consecutive games with a rushing touchdown to 27. That record still stands today. Suggs finished the game with 19carries for 70rushing yards and two touchdowns. Tech wide receiver Ernest Wilford, who caught fivepasses for 50yards, set <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> school record for receptions in a season with 51. This broke the record of 46, set by Mike Burnop in 1971.|$|E
5|$|The ZX81 {{could be}} bought by mail order {{in kit form}} or pre-assembled. In <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> major innovation, {{it was the first}} cheap mass-market home {{computer}} that could be bought from high street stores, led by W. H. Smith and soon many other retailers. The ZX81 marked the first time that computing in Britain became an activity for the general public, rather than the preserve of businesspeople and electronics hobbyists. It inspired the creation of a huge community of enthusiasts, some of whom founded their own businesses producing software and hardware for the ZX81. Many went on {{to play a major role}} in the British computer industry in later years. The ZX81's commercial success made Sinclair Research one of Britain's leading computer manufacturers and earned a fortune and an eventual knighthood for the company's founder, Sir Clive Sinclair.|$|E
5000|$|In the late-80s {{there was}} an [...] "improvcore scene" [...] {{centering}} on [...] "Olive Oil's", located on the waterfront in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>an</b> industrial neighborhood of San Francisco.This featured performers such as the Splatter Trio, the Rova Saxophone Quartet and the Molecules..|$|R
50|$|Inspired {{by several}} {{buildings}} of the 1898 Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition held nearby in Kountze Place, the North Presbyterian Church was built in 1910. F. A.

5|$|William A. Foote was a 30-year-old grist mill {{operator}} in Adrian, Michigan, in 1884 when, in <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> common occurrence, he provided space and shaft power from his mill wheel to Thomson - Houston, a local electric utility startup, to light 12 streetlights. Fascinated by the potential, {{within a year}} he enlisted his then 17-year-old brother James and moved to Jackson, Michigan, and in 1886 they jointly founded Jackson Electric Light Works (a predecessor company to Consumers Energy), which began by lighting downtown Jackson electrically. The Foote brothers set up similar city specific companies in Battle Creek and Adrian within a few years. In many cases dams already built for grist mills, sawmills and the like were refit for electric generators, but in some cases, new dams were constructed. As the familiarity with the technology, and the technology itself, improved, the scope of projects became more ambitious.|$|E
5|$|Bushnell and Dabney {{began to}} design custom {{hardware}} {{to run the}} game's functions, and they soon discovered that the cost to build the whole game's computing systems would be much lower. As a result, they would not need to have multiple instances of the game running on the same machine {{in order to be}} profitable. On the other hand, however, the custom hardware was not as powerful as the more expensive Nova computer, which meant that the pair needed to make gameplay modifications. Spacewar was a two-player game featuring dogfights around the gravitational field of a central star; neither of these features could be run on the dedicated circuits the pair were making, so the game was cut down to a single-player game wherein the player would fight against two computer-controlled spaceships in open space. By January 1971, the pair had built some basic hardware which could connect to a monitor, with plans to continue expanding it to make a game now named Cosmic Combat, but they were still far away from turning <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> dot moving on a screen into a full Spacewar-like game cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Early {{into his}} fourth {{season with the}} Canucks, Kesler was {{cross-checked}} in the face by Flyers forward Jesse Boulerice. The cross-check was an immediate response to Kesler hitting Flyers defenseman Randy Jones and resulted in Kesler leaving {{the game with a}} sore jaw. Boulerice was subsequently suspended for 25 games, matching the then largest suspension in NHL history. Later in the season, Kesler was involved in another violent on-ice incident when Anaheim Ducks defenseman Chris Pronger used his skate blade to stomp on Kesler's calf. Kesler was not injured on the play. Although the NHL originally announced that Pronger would not receive a suspension on the play, he later received an eight-game suspension when new video emerged of the incident. Over the course of the season, Kesler established himself as a solid two-way center, scoring <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>then</b> <b>a</b> career high 21 goals and 37 points and playing a regular shutdown role against opposing teams' top players and on the penalty kill with linemate Alexandre Burrows.|$|E
