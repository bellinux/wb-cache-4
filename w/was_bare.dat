However {{there is a very}} large Batch almost in the middle of Camerton that is now a designated Local Nature Reserve. The Batch <b>was</b> <b>bare,</b> like the Paulton ones until, according to locals, the wife of the owner of Camerton Court decided to pay for it to be planted with trees to improve the view. There are small batches at Clutton, east of Radford Hill and at Greyfields, High Littleton.|$|E

Now that trees have become established, the landmark qualities of the memorial itself have diminished somewhat. However, the setting and location still forms a landmark within the streetscape.|$|E
500|$|The Modular Buildings {{series is}} viewed by Lego {{designers}} and fan sites as [...] "toys for adults". Product reviews have been very positive with the biggest criticisms being price and degree of difficulty. [...] With Café Corner, one reviewer complained that {{the interior of the}} building <b>was</b> <b>bare</b> of any finishing. [...] This complaint was addressed in later models such as Green Grocer, which had finished interior details included in each of its three floors.|$|E

500|$|The 20,000-strong Ottoman {{force was}} {{deployed}} {{to defend the}} Jaffa to Jerusalem railway along the Wadi al-Sarar and Al-Nabi Rubin. The battlefield was generally cultivated but with winter approaching it <b>was</b> <b>bare</b> and open. Its most prominent feature, the [...] high ridge which continues north towards Zernukah and El Kubeibeh formed {{the backbone of the}} Ottoman Army's [...] long defensive position. The naturally strong Ottoman line was defended by the Eighth Army's 3rd Division (XXII Corps) to the north, the 7th Division (Eighth Army Reserve) to the east, the 54th Division (XX Corps) near el Mesmiye and the 26th Division (XX Corps) holding Tel es Safi. Benefiting from the terrain two strong defensive positions with commanding views of the countryside were located on the ridge. They were the villages of Qatra and Al-Maghar. These villages were separated by the Wadi Jamus which links the Wadi al-Sarar with the Nahr Rubin.|$|E
500|$|The board's efforts {{failed to}} meet the {{government}}'s expectations; in December 1917, Woodrow Wilson, the President of the United States, ordered the federal government {{to take control of the}} railroads, setting up a United States Railroad Administration (USRA) to run them. Harrison worked for the USRA during the war and, under its regulations, was required to step down as chairman of the Southern Railway. By the time the USRA returned control of Southern in March 1920 its treasury <b>was</b> <b>bare.</b> A few years of operation returned a surplus to the company, which led to the stockholders requesting in 1923 that the railroad pay a dividend to the holders of the common stock, something Southern had never done. Harrison managed to block the request, but in March 1924 a subsequent demand was successful, and a dividend of $5 (approximately $ as of [...] ) per share was declared. That was increased to $7 (approximately $ as of [...] ) per share in 1926 and $8 (approximately $ as of [...] ) in 1928.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} met with {{negative}} reviews by critics and mixed enthusiasm by theater proprietors. The Morning Telegraph found it unbelievable and only {{for the sake of}} the plot that family would be reunited by happenstance. The Moving Picture World was negative finding that it was not a strong offering because of the plot and the camerawork having resulted in a cloudy image quality in parts of the production. The New York Dramatic Mirror found the concept of the plot to be interesting, but the execution to have been poorly executed. [...] The review found that the production was crude, cheap and unconvincing because the set <b>was</b> <b>bare</b> and lacked the presence of onlookers on the city scenes. Advertisers like the Majestic theater of Wellington, Kansas, would prompt it as a [...] "well told story". The Empire in Frederick, Maryland, would be equally promotional and appeal to the audience as having pretty girls in the cast. The Edisonia in Durham, North Carolina, advertised the film as a strong Thanhouser drama that was [...] "thrilling, pathetic, interesting". The film is presumed lost.|$|E

2500|$|Robert Sylvester Kelly {{was born}} on January 8, 1967 at Chicago Lying-in Hospital in Hyde Park, Chicago. Kelly is the third of four {{children}}. Kelly's single mother, Joanne, was a singer. She raised her children Baptist. Kelly's father was absent throughout his son's life. Kelly's family lived in the Ida B. Wells Homes public housing project in Chicago's Bronzeville neighborhood. Kelly's high school music teacher Lena McLin described Kelly's childhood home: [...] "It <b>was</b> <b>bare.</b> One table, two chairs. There was no father there, I knew that, and they had very little". Kelly began singing in the church choir at age eight.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few days}} later, Grace {{returned}} to Lord's and produced [...] "one {{of his most}} commanding performances". Playing for the Gentlemen against the Players, he scored 134, all run, out of only 201 and said later that it was [...] "my finest innings" [...] as the pitch was playing [...] "queerly". In fact, the pitch <b>was</b> <b>bare</b> in places and behaved erratically with good-length balls sometimes flying over the wicketkeeper's head. Grace then took 6–50 and 4–31 (10–81 in the match) to complete a [...] "match double". The Players had to follow on and the Gentlemen won by 8 wickets. In Simon Rae's view, [...] "W.G. had won the most important match of the season virtually on his own".|$|E

2500|$|The first emigrants from Poland were Silesians {{from the}} Prussian {{partition}} of Poland. They settled in Texas in 1854, creating an agricultural community that carried their native traditions, customs, and language. The land they chose <b>was</b> <b>bare,</b> unpopulated countryside, and they erected the homes, churches, and municipal accommodations {{as a private}} community. The first home built by a Pole is the John Gawlik House, constructed 1858. The building still stands, and displays a high-pitched roof common in Eastern European architecture. The Poles in Texas built brick houses with thatched roofs until the 1900s. That region in Texas is subject to less than 1 inch of snow per year, and meteorological studies show that level of insulation is unwarranted. The Polish Texans modified their homes from their European models, building shaded verandas to escape the subtropical temperatures. They often added porches to their verandas, particularly on the southward windy side. According to oral histories recorded from descendants, the verandas were used for [...] "almost all daily activities from preparing meals to dressing animal hides." [...] Panna Maria, Texas, was often called a Polish colony because of its ethnic and cultural isolation from Texas, and remains an unincorporated community in Texas. The geographically isolated area continues to maintain its heritage but the population mostly moved to nearby Karnes City and Falls City.|$|E
60|$|Oliver {{looked across}} the brook, and saw there, upon a bank, under some trees, a spot which <b>was</b> <b>bare.</b> The reason why it <b>was</b> <b>bare</b> was, that the snow had nearly all blown off during the storms; and then the sun, which had been shining for some days so pleasantly, had melted away what there had been left; and now the ground <b>was</b> <b>bare,</b> and almost dry. But the {{difficulty}} was to get to it; for it was upon {{the other side of}} the stream, and the bed of the stream was filled with water and ice.|$|E

Not a sign was to be seen of horses or of treasure or of people--nothing but a square block of marble, and upon it a black casket, and upon that again a gold ring, in which was set a blood-red stone.
