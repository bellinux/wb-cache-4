40|$|There are {{techniques}} for separating aluminum alloys from mixed scrap, {{but there are}} no efficient ways to separate wrought aluminum from cast aluminum. This Bureau of Mines report describes a novel technique for separating mixed aluminum alloy scrap into cast and <b>wrought</b> aluminum <b>alloy</b> fractions. The technique, which uses conventional heating, fragmentizing, and screening equipment, exploits differences in the mechanical properties of cast and <b>wrought</b> aluminum <b>alloys</b> at elevated temperatures. The cast alloys become brittle at high temperatures owing to intergranular melting of regions of eutectic composition. This melting begins to occur as the solidus temperature for each alloy is reached. Solidus temperatures for casting alloys generally range from 52020 to 58020 C, but are above 60020 C for most <b>wrought</b> <b>alloys.</b> Thus, the casting alloys are easily fragmented while the <b>wrought</b> <b>alloys</b> remain ductile in the proper temperature range. Starting with a mixture containing approximately 80 pct cast and 20 pct <b>wrought</b> <b>alloys,</b> fractions of 100 pct cast and 98 pct wrought have been produced...|$|R

40|$|<b>Wrought</b> aluminum-based <b>alloys</b> exhibit {{superior}} {{physical and}} mechanical properties compared to conventional shape casting <b>alloys.</b> However, <b>wrought</b> <b>alloys</b> cannot be cast into near net shapes because they develop hot tears and hot cracks during solidification. For this reason, these alloys are typically {{cast into ingots}} and are subsequently brought to final shape by mechanical processes such as rolling, extrusion, drawing and forging. These processes significantly increase {{the cost of the}} manufactured component. Controlled Diffusion Solidification (CDS) is a novel process that allows casting of <b>wrought</b> <b>alloys</b> directly into final shapes that are free of hot tears; thus CDS eliminates the added cost of machining. The process follows a different route from conventional casting methods. In CDS two liquid alloys of predetermined composition and temperature are mixed together so that upon solidification the resultant alloy has a globular rather than a dendritic microstructure as shown in Figure 1. The hot tearing tendency of <b>wrought</b> <b>alloys</b> originates from the inadequate permeability of their dendritic network, which obstructs the flow of interdendritic liquid and hinders compensation for shrinkage. The nondendritic microstructure made possible by CDS minimizes hot-tearing thus enabling <b>wrought</b> <b>alloys</b> to be cast directly. The CDS has the potential to: Reduce the cost of multiple component assemblies Minimize several typical casting defects that are associated with solidification Reduce the time required to fabricate assemblies Reduce process variability by controlling the solidification Increase casting application...|$|R

50|$|Aluminium alloys (or {{aluminum}} alloys; see spelling differences) are alloys {{in which}} aluminium (Al) is the predominant metal. The typical alloying elements are copper, magnesium, manganese, silicon, tin and zinc. There are two principal classifications, namely casting <b>alloys</b> and <b>wrought</b> <b>alloys,</b> {{both of which}} are further subdivided into the categories heat-treatable and non-heat-treatable. About 85% of aluminium is used for wrought products, for example rolled plate, foils and extrusions. Cast aluminium alloys yield cost-effective products due to the low melting point, although they generally have lower tensile strengths than <b>wrought</b> <b>alloys.</b> The most important cast aluminium alloy system is Al-Si, where the high levels of silicon (4.0-13%) contribute to give good casting characteristics. Aluminium alloys are widely used in engineering structures and components where light weight or corrosion resistance is required.|$|R
50|$|High {{strength}} {{beryllium copper}} alloys contain {{as much as}} 2.7% beryllium (cast), or 1.6-2% beryllium with about 0.3% cobalt (wrought). The strength is achieved by age hardening. The thermal conductivity of these alloys lies between steels and aluminium. The cast alloys are frequently formed with injection molds. The <b>wrought</b> <b>alloys</b> are designated by UNS as C17200 to C17400, the cast alloys are C82000 to C82800. The hardening process requires rapid cooling of the annealed metal, resulting in a solid state solution of beryllium in copper, which is then kept at 200-460 °C {{for at least an}} hour, producing a precipitation of metastable beryllide crystals in the copper matrix. Overaging beyond the equilibrium phase depletes the beryllide crystals and reduces the strength. The beryllides in cast alloys are similar to those in <b>wrought</b> <b>alloys.</b>|$|R
