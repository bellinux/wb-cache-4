5000|$|The initial NACA X-4 flights, which {{continued}} {{from late}} 1950 through May of 1951, {{focused on the}} aircraft's sensitivity to pitch. NACA pilots Griffith and Scott Crossfield noted that as the X-4's speed approached Mach 0.88, it began a pitch oscillation of increasing severity, which was likened to driving on a <b>washboard</b> <b>road.</b> Increasing speeds also caused a tucking phenomena, in which the nose pitched down, a phenomenon also experienced by the Me 163A Anton prototypes in 1941. More seriously, the aircraft also showed a tendency to [...] "hunt" [...] about all three axes. This combined yaw, pitch and roll, which grew more severe as the speed increased, was a precursor to the inertial coupling which would become a major challenge {{in the years to}} come.|$|E

In {{order to}} {{research}} the fatigue fracture problem of the rear axle of a China-made car at the reliability test stage on the durable enhancement roads of proving ground, and the strain loading spectrum of the rear axle fracture location and the weak points of the finite element analysis was measured. The fatigue damage of the broken crack at the rear axle on the durable enhancement roads was calculated and contrasted detailedly. At the same time, a six-channel MTS coupling system is used to conduct the vibration mode frequency sweep to the rear axle and car body of test car and the benchmarking car, and through vibration frequency sweep, {{an analysis of the}} reason of differences between the two cars and its relationship with the car body vibration frequency is made. The enhancement test and frequency sweep results show that the fatigue damage of two vehicles focuses mainly on the <b>washboard</b> <b>road,</b> the impact of the speed on the fatigue damage of the test car fluctuates significantly, the damages of the two cars vary greatly when the forced vibration excitation frequency of the <b>washboard</b> <b>road</b> is greater than 20 Hz and the vibration modal frequency of the rear axle is close to the excitation frequency of the <b>washboard</b> <b>road,</b> causing high stress distribution and then fatigue fracture to the rear axle of the test car. The test results have provided an important basis for the structural improvement of the broken rear axle and the enhancement in the fatigue strength of the rear axle...|$|E

50|$|Several {{articles}} addressing real-life <b>washboarding</b> on <b>roads</b> cite South Dakota Local Transportation Assistance Program (LTAP) Special Bulletin #29, “Dealing with Washboarding,” by Ken Skorseth. These sources attribute washboarding {{to three}} causes: dry granular materials, vehicle speeds, {{and the quality}} of the granular material. Other cited causes include vehicle speed, traffic volume, and hard acceleration or braking. Also, the source claims that light vehicles have a bigger effect on producing washboarding than heavy trucks.|$|R

40|$|When {{submitted}} to the repeated passages of vehicles unpaved roads made of sand or gravel can develop a ripply pattern known as washboard or corrugated road. We propose a stability analysis based on experimental measurements of the force acting on a blade (or plow) dragged on a circular sand track and show that a linear model is sufficient to describe the instability near onset. The relation between the trajectory of the plow and {{the profile of the}} sand bed left after its passage is studied experimentally. The various terms in the expression of the lift force created by the flow of granular material on the plow are determined up to first order by imposing a sinusoidal trajectory to the blade on an initially flat sand bed, as well as by imposing a horizontal trajectory on an initially rippled sand bed. Our model recovers all the previously observed features of <b>washboard</b> <b>road</b> and accurately predicts the most unstable wavelength near onset as well as the critical velocity for the instability.

40|$|Rapid {{advances}} {{have been made}} in the field of vehicle dynamics in terms of improving the ride, handling and safety using actuators and control systems. Optimising a vehicle’s ride comfort or handling has led to the development of semi-active suspension systems. Anti-lock braking systems (ABS) have resulted in significant improvements in vehicle braking whilst maintaining directional control over the vehicle. These {{advances have}} improved vehicle and occupant safety in general, but there are often some trade-offs. For example, the stopping distance of a vehicle fitted with ABS on an undulating road is significantly increased compared to braking without ABS. This has severe implications, especially in the off-road vehicle industry. The effects of spring and damper characteristics on the braking performance of a sports-utility-vehicle (SUV) on hard rough terrain are investigated. The approach is simulation based, using an experimentally validated full vehicle model of the SUV, built in Adams in co-simulation with MATLAB and Simulink. The simulations were performed on measured road profiles of a Belgian paving and parallel corrugations (or a <b>washboard</b> <b>road).</b> The results indicate that the suspension system has a significant impact on the braking performance, resulting in differences in stopping distances of up to 9 m.

50|$|Washboarding or {{corrugation}} is {{the occurrence}} of periodic, transverse ripples in the surface of gravel and dirt <b>roads.</b> <b>Washboarding</b> occurs in dry, granular road material with repeated traffic, traveling at speeds above 5 mi/h km/h. Washboarding creates an uncomfortable ride for the occupants of traversing vehicles and hazardous driving conditions for vehicles that travel too fast to maintain traction and control.|$|R
40|$|Granular {{surfaces}} tend {{to develop}} lateral ripples under {{the action of}} surface forces exerted by rolling wheels, an effect known as <b>washboard</b> or corrugated <b>road.</b> We report the results of both laboratory experiments and soft-particle direct numerical simulations. Above a critical speed, the ripple pattern appears as small patches of traveling waves which eventually spread to the entire circumference. The ripples drift slowly in the driving direction. Interesting secondary dynamics of the saturated ripples were observed, as well as various ripple creation and destruction events. All of these effects are captured qualitatively by 2 D soft particle simulations in which a disk rolls over a bed of poly-disperse particles in a periodic box. These simulations show that compaction and segregation are inessential to the ripple phenomenon. We also discuss a simplified scaling model which gives {{some insight into the}} mechanism of the instability. Comment: 5 pages 5 figure...|$|R
