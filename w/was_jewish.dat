5|$|Some {{historian}}s opine that Hitler {{would have}} assumed Stefanie was of Jewish origin. American historian Graeme Donald believes Hitler would have inferred that she <b>was</b> <b>Jewish,</b> but saw {{no problems with}} this at the time. This view is supported by German historian Anton Joachimsthaler, who stated in a BBC interview that Hitler must have assumed she <b>was</b> <b>Jewish</b> because of her Jewish surname. British singer-songwriter, author, journalist and paranormal researcher Paul Roland wrote in his book Nazi Women that it didn't make the slightest difference to Hitler whether she <b>was</b> <b>Jewish</b> or not.|$|E
5|$|Meyerbeer's costly operas, {{requiring}} grand casts {{of leading}} singers, were gradually {{dropped from the}} repertoire in the early 20th century. They were banned in Germany from 1933, and subsequently in subject countries, by the Nazi regime because the composer <b>was</b> <b>Jewish,</b> {{and this was a}} major factor in their further disappearance from the repertory.|$|E
5|$|Nazi {{official}} Hans Frank {{suggested that}} Alois's {{mother had been}} employed as a housekeeper by a Jewish family in Graz, and that the family's 19-year-old son Leopold Frankenberger had fathered Alois. No Frankenberger was registered in Graz during that period, and no record has been produced of Leopold Frankenberger's existence, so historians dismiss the claim that Alois's father <b>was</b> <b>Jewish.</b>|$|E

5|$|On March 16, 1939, Germany invaded Czechoslovakia, {{breaking}} the Munich Agreement, which caused the French Army to start mobilizing {{in anticipation of}} a coming war. Shortly afterwards, several of the film's electricians and technicians left to join the army. Set designer Eugène Lourié left because he <b>was</b> <b>Jewish</b> and a communist, and Max Douy took over as the film's set designer.|$|E
5|$|Rosenberg {{was born}} in Marin County, California. Her father is Jack Lee Rosenberg, a {{psychotherapist}} {{and the founder of}} integrative body psychotherapy. Her mother was Patricia Rosenberg, a lawyer. She was the second of four children by her father's first marriage and another by his second. Rosenberg's father <b>was</b> <b>Jewish,</b> and her mother was of Irish Catholic background.|$|E
5|$|A {{letter written}} by former New Mexico Territory Governor Miguel Otero in 1940 appears to {{indicate}} that Earp had strong feelings for Josephine in April 1882. After leaving Tombstone following the Earp Vendetta Ride, the Earp posse went to Albuquerque, New Mexico, for two weeks. While there, Wyatt stayed with prominent businessman Henry N. Jaffa, who was also president of New Albuquerque’s Board of Trade. Like Josephine, Jaffa <b>was</b> <b>Jewish.</b>|$|E
5000|$|JSR {{provides}} {{information as to}} who <b>is</b> <b>Jewish</b> in the sports world, verifying the Jewish background of every athlete covered. JSRs criteria are that an athlete <b>is</b> <b>Jewish</b> if {{at least one parent}} <b>is</b> <b>Jewish,</b> he did not practice any other religion during his athletic career, and he self-identifies as etnically Jewish. [...] If an athlete has a <b>Jewish</b> parent but <b>was</b> raised in, or converted to, another faith, or indicated to JSR that he did not wish to <b>be</b> considered <b>Jewish,</b> he <b>is</b> excluded (even though under Jewish law he might <b>be</b> considered <b>Jewish).</b> [...] Moxson indicates that David Beckham is not included, as only his mothers father <b>is</b> <b>Jewish,</b> and he does not identify himself as Jewish.|$|R

5|$|At the University of Heidelberg, Goebbels {{wrote his}} {{doctoral}} thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz, a minor 19th century romantic dramatist. He {{had hoped to}} write his thesis {{under the supervision of}} Friedrich Gundolf, who at that time was a well known literary historian. It did not seem to bother Goebbels that Gundolf <b>was</b> <b>Jewish.</b> However, Gundolf was no longer performing teaching duties, so he directed Goebbels to associate professor Max Freiherr von Waldberg. Waldberg was also Jewish. It was Waldberg who recommended Goebbels write his thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz. After submitting the thesis and passing his oral examination, Goebbels earned his PhD in 1921.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, the {{majority}} of the city's population <b>was</b> <b>Jewish.</b> According to Russian census of 1897, out of the total population of 66,000, Jews constituted 41,900 (so around 63% percent). This heritage can be seen on the Jewish Heritage Trail in Białystok. The first Anarchist groups to attract a significant following of Russian workers or peasants, were the Anarcho-Communist Chernoe-Znamia groups, founded in Białystok in 1903. The Białystok pogrom occurred between 14–16 June 1906 in the city. During the pogrom between 81 and 88 people were killed, and about 80 people were wounded.|$|E
5|$|Bethe {{was born}} in Strasbourg, which was then part of Germany, on July 2, 1906, {{the only child of}} Anna (née Kuhn) and Albrecht Bethe, a privatdozent of {{physiology}} at the University of Strasbourg. Although his mother, the daughter of a professor at the University of Strasbourg, <b>was</b> <b>Jewish,</b> he was raised a Protestant like his father. Despite having a religious background, he was not religious in later life, and described himself as an atheist.|$|E

5|$|Connelly {{was born}} in Cairo, New York, in the Catskill Mountains. She is the {{daughter}} of Ilene, an antiques dealer, and Gerard Karl Connelly (1941–2008), a clothing manufacturer. Her father was Roman Catholic, and of Irish and Norwegian descent. Connelly's mother <b>was</b> <b>Jewish,</b> and was educated at a yeshiva; all of Connelly's mother's grandparents were Jewish emigrants from Poland and Russia. Connelly was raised primarily in Brooklyn Heights, near the Brooklyn Bridge, where she attended Saint Ann's, a private school specializing in the Arts. Her father suffered from asthma, so the family moved to Woodstock, New York, in 1976 to escape the city smog. Four years later, the family returned to Brooklyn Heights, and Connelly returned to Saint Ann's.|$|E
5|$|Moe Berg <b>was</b> <b>Jewish</b> and was {{the third}} and last child of Bernard Berg, a pharmacist, and Rose (Tashker), a homemaker, both Jewish, {{who lived in the}} Harlem section of New York City, New York, {{a few blocks from the}} Polo Grounds. When Berg was three and a half, he begged his mother to let him start school. In 1906, Bernard Berg bought a {{pharmacy}} in West Newark. In 1910 the Berg family moved again, to the Roseville section of Newark. Roseville offered Bernard Berg everything he wanted in a neighborhoodgood schools, middle-class residents, and very few Jews.|$|E
5|$|Ursula Maria Martius {{was born}} in Munich, Germany on September 16, 1921. Her mother <b>was</b> <b>Jewish</b> and an art {{historian}} and her father, an ethnographer, came from an old German Protestant family. Because of the Nazi persecution of the Jews, her parents tried to send their only child to school in Britain when World War II broke out, but the British refused to issue a student visa to anyone under 18. Ursula studied chemistry and physics at Berlin University until she was expelled by the Nazis. Her parents were interned in concentration camps while Franklin herself {{was sent to a}} forced labour camp. The family survived The Holocaust and was reunited in Berlin after the war.|$|E

His parents withdrew him from the boarding school to put him in school in Ambert.|$|E
5|$|A {{doctoral}} student of Curie, Marguerite Perey, {{became the first}} woman elected to membership in the Academy– over half a century later, in 1962. Despite Curie's fame as a scientist working for France, the public's attitude tended toward xenophobia—the same that had led to the Dreyfus affair–which also fueled false speculation that Curie <b>was</b> <b>Jewish.</b> During the French Academy of Sciences elections, she was vilified by the right wing press who criticised her for being a foreigner and an atheist. Her daughter later remarked on the public hypocrisy as the French press often portrayed Curie as an unworthy foreigner when she was nominated for a French honour, but would portray her as a French hero when she received a foreign one such as her Nobel Prizes.|$|E
5|$|In January 1933, the Nazi Party came {{to power}} in Germany, and Born, who <b>was</b> <b>Jewish,</b> was suspended. He emigrated to the United Kingdom, where he took a job at St John's College, Cambridge, and wrote a popular science book, The Restless Universe, as well as Atomic Physics, which soon became a {{standard}} textbook. In October 1936, he became the Tait Professor of Natural Philosophy at the University of Edinburgh, where, working with German-born assistants E. Walter Kellermann and Klaus Fuchs, he continued his research into physics. Max Born became a naturalised British subject on 31 August 1939, one day before World War II broke out in Europe. He remained at Edinburgh until 1952. He retired to Bad Pyrmont, in West Germany, and died in hospital in Göttingen on 5 January 1970.|$|E

5|$|In September 1943, word reached Bohr and {{his brother}} Harald that the Nazis {{considered}} their family to be Jewish, since their mother <b>was</b> <b>Jewish,</b> {{and that they were}} therefore in danger of being arrested. The Danish resistance helped Bohr and his wife escape by sea to Sweden on 29 September. The next day, Bohr persuaded King Gustaf V of Sweden to make public Sweden's willingness to provide asylum to Jewish refugees. On 2 October 1943, Swedish radio broadcast that Sweden was ready to offer asylum, and the mass rescue of the Danish Jews by their countrymen followed swiftly thereafter. Some historians claim that Bohr's actions led directly to the mass rescue, while others say that, though Bohr did all that he could for his countrymen, his actions were not a decisive influence on the wider events. Eventually, over 7,000 Danish Jews escaped to Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Specter {{was born}} in Wichita, Kansas, the {{youngest}} child of Lillie (née Shanin) and Harry Specter, {{who grew up in}} the Bachkuryne village of Cherkasy Oblast, Ukraine. Specter <b>was</b> <b>Jewish,</b> and wrote in his memoir, Passion for Truth, that his father's family was the only Jewish family in the village. The family lived at 940 South Emporia Street in Wichita before moving to Russell, Kansas, where he graduated from Russell High School in 1947. Russell is also the hometown of fellow politician Bob Dole (who graduated from Russell High School in 1941). Specter said that his father weighed items from his junkyard on a scale owned by Dole's father Doran Dole (who owned a granary). He said his brother Morton and Dole's brother Kenny were contemporaries and friends.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} {{justification for}} the GRC scheme is to entrench minority representation in Parliament. However, opposition parties have questioned the usefulness of GRCs in fulfilling this purpose, especially since Singapore has not faced the issue of minorities being under-represented in Parliament. In fact, statistics show that all PAP minority candidates have won regularly {{and that the only}} two MPs to lose their seats in 1984 were Chinese. One of them was beaten by a minority candidate. In addition, Joshua Benjamin Jeyaratnam of the Workers' Party of Singapore won a by-election in 1981 at Anson, a largely Chinese constituency, and the first elected Chief Minister of Singapore was David Marshall who <b>was</b> <b>Jewish.</b> Technically, as the size of GRCs has increased, the minority has had less representation overall as the proportion of minority MPs per GRC has been reduced. Since minority MPs are a numerical minority in Parliament, their political clout has also been reduced.|$|E
