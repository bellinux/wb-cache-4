500|$|Reviewing the 1899 revival, The Athenaeum {{managed to}} praise the piece while joining in the musical establishment's {{critique}} of Sullivan. On the one hand, [...] "The Pinafore... sounds fresher than ever. The musical world has become serious – very serious – and it is indeed refreshing to hear a merry, humorous piece, and music, unassuming in character... it is delicately scored, {{and in many ways}} displays ability of a high order". On the other hand, it wrote that if Sullivan had pursued the path of composing more serious music, like his symphony, [...] "he would have produced still higher results; in like manner Pinafore set us <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> composer would have accomplished with a libretto of somewhat similar kind, but one giving him larger scope for the exercise of his gifts".|$|E

500|$|Fan {{reaction}} was largely positive, though certain fans {{complained that the}} game was a far departure from its predecessor, Chrono Trigger; Chrono Cross broke convention by featuring more characters, fewer double and triple techs, fewer instances of time travel, and few appearances of Trigger characters and locations. Producer Hiromichi Tanaka and director Masato Kato {{were aware of the}} changes in development, specifically intending to provide an experience different from Chrono Trigger. Kato anticipated and rebuffed this discontent before the game's release, <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> Chrono title meant to these fans and whether his messages ever [...] "really got through to them". He continued, [...] "Cross is undoubtedly the highest quality Chrono that we can create right now. (I won't say the 'best' Chrono, but) If you can't accept that, then I'm sorry to say this but I guess your Chrono and my Chrono have taken totally different paths. But I would like to say, thank you for falling in love with Trigger so much." [...] Tanaka added, [...] "Of course, the fans of the original are very important, but what innovation can come about when you're bound to the past? I believe that gameplay should evolve with the hardware." ...|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on January 3, 1911. The film had a wide national release, advertising theaters include those in Indiana, Kansas, Utah, Wisconsin, North Carolina, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, Illinois, Missouri, and Ohio. The Billboard reviewed the film and offered praise for the production, [...] "This picture presents {{a story that is}} decidedly original and away from beaten paths. The settings in Turkey are elaborate and faithful to Turkish customs. All the players portray their respective parts in an excellent manner. The photography is very good." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror provided a summary of the film and concluded that the film [...] "was well enacted and the sets were fully adequate, creating a fair illusion of the Oriental land depicted." [...] The Moving Picture World was also provided a positive review, stating [...] "The scenic effects are interesting and the story is lively enough to keep the audience <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> end will be." [...] One advertisement for the film erroneously claimed that the film was shot in the Orient, unaware that the film was shot in Thanhouser's studio.|$|E
500|$|Charles Onyett from IGN applauded Gravity Bone, {{saying that}} it is [...] "a game that appears to toy with the notions of heroism and villainy, and the ways the player {{identifies}} with, and is directed toward, both roles." [...] He praised all aspects of the game, commenting, [...] "the cohesiveness of its striking visual presentation, soundtrack and effects, and almost entirely incomprehensible story combine to create an atmosphere of peculiar strength." [...] Onyett concluded his preview of the game by stating, [...] "it's a pleasure to experience, and never ceases to delight and surprise over its short run." [...] Anthony Burch from Destructoid gave a positive review, stating that it [...] "is so stylistically unified, so consistently cool and weird and imaginative, that it's damn near impossible not to fall in love with—even as the game ends and you're <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> hell happened, and why." [...] He also applauded several technical and design aspects of the game, expressing appreciation for the game's [...] "stylistic choices", as well as the [...] "nigh unbelievable" [...] bloom effects featured in the game. Burch concluded that Gravity Bone is [...] "a great ride", and that the [...] "atmosphere and style alone will barrel you through to the journey's end, which comes all too soon." ...|$|E

500|$|In January 2011, a Daytime Emmy Awards [...] "final push" [...] by Canyon News {{suggested}} that Case's performance needed more Emmy attention. Soap Opera Digest praised Phyllis finding {{the evidence that}} freed Sharon from prison in 2011, writing: [...] "The twist that Phyl hijacked the glory from both Adam and estranged sister Avery was downright delicious—and made Sharon beholden her worst enemy. The cherry on top? Sharon giving Adam an overdue verbal beatdown. Justice has finally been served." [...] Case's performance in 2012, described as a [...] "whirlwind year", was met with critical acclaim due to writing by Bell (which, in turn, was criticized). On-Air On-Soaps commented, [...] "Surviving {{probably one of the}} worst on-screen character assassinations in soap opera history, which virtually left viewers <b>wondering,</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> heck are the writers doing to the integrity of Sharon Newman, the once befallen heroine of Genoa City?, Case rebounded by making her performances noteworthy, no matter what the creative teams decided to do to her character." [...] This led Soap Opera Uncensored to name her Entertainer of the Year in January 2013. In December 2015, Soap Opera Digest praised her portrayal of the character's [...] "emotional roller coaster" [...] and remarked, [...] "Sharon Case has a knack for bringing emotional depth and reality to even the most outrageously soapy situations".|$|E
500|$|J. Edawrd Keyes of Newsday {{said that}} {{producers}} {{were able to}} deliver a concert [...] "that was the visual and sonic equivalent of washing down a pound of sugar with 27 cans of soda." [...] Keyes added that, despite Cyrus' charisma, it was evident the show and the dual-persona arrangement (considering {{that there were no}} major divergences between them) was an evident strategy to extend marketing and receive more profits. Peter Hartlaub of the San Francisco Chronicle believed Cyrus was a fair singer and commented, [...] "It was relatively wholesome, musically tolerable and certainly had plenty of production value. Some adults may have walked away <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> big fuss was about, but none of the kids looked the least bit disappointed." [...] Jane Stevenson of the Canadian Online Explorer noted the differences between Hannah Montana and Cyrus, stating that Cyrus was the [...] "marginally tougher cookie of the two singers" [...] and that audiences received two concerts for the price of one. An uncredited review from The Palm Beach Post stated, [...] "Both halves [...] were enjoyable and lively, set apart by Cyrus’ preternaturally assured stage presence, {{in and out of the}} wig." [...] It also stated that the Hannah Montana set was more satisfying due to the quality of the songs and more energy. Geoff Edgers of The Boston Globe wrote, [...] "Of course, most of the mainly tweener fans in the arena weren't splitting [...] musical hairs. They ate up the spectacle of the show, with its costume changes, giant video screens, and sparklers." ...|$|E
500|$|Lord Hope {{disagreed}} with the principles and analogies relied upon by the majority. [...] Of the principle that [...] "where there is a wrong {{there must be a}} remedy", he said that the policy decision to protect witnesses from litigation had been taken some time ago, without anything being said to cast doubt on the policy choice. [...] He also asked how the rule could be altered to allow negligence claims but not defamation claims, since if there was a well-founded defamation claim barred by witness immunity then a wrong would have been done without remedy in that instance. He said that advocates and experts performed different functions and so it could not be assumed that the fact that advocates' immunity had been removed without difficulty would mean that immunity could be removed from experts without any problems. [...] He was more impressed with the difficulties about where to draw the line if the claim was allowed to proceed than the argument {{that there would be a}} [...] "chilling effect" [...] on the availability of witnesses, <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> impact would be for experts involved in criminal proceedings or family cases involving children. He wondered whether a company director, owing a duty of care to the company, would face removal of the immunity if making an [...] "inexcusable error" [...] when giving evidence on the company's behalf. [...] Overall, he considered that the matter was best left to Parliament and the Law Commission. He furthermore noted that the decision in Watson remained binding in Scots law, in preference to the decision in Jones (since Jones only concerned the law of England and Wales), adding that the issue ought also to be considered by the Scottish Law Commission.|$|E

There didn't seem to be any geography and you were <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> hell was going on." [...] Kim Newman of Empire gave it 4/5, remarking it was not [...] "bigger and better than Casino Royale, [...] perhaps a smart move in that there's still a sense at the finish that Bond's mission has barely begun." [...] However, he expressed nostalgia for the more humorous Bond films. The Sunday Times review noted that [...] "following Casino Royale {{was never going to be}} easy, but the director Marc Forster has brought the brand's successful relaunch crashing back to earth – with a yawn"; the screenplay [...] "is at times incomprehensible" [...] and the casting [...] "is a mess." [...] The review concludes that [...] "Bond has been stripped of his iconic status. He no longer represents anything particularly British, or even modern. In place of glamour, we get a spurious grit; instead of style, we get product placement; in place of fantasy, we get a redundant and silly realism." [...] The Guardian gave a more positive review, rating it as 3/5 stars, and was particularly fond of Craig's performance, saying he [...] "made the part his own, every inch the coolly ruthless agent-killer, nursing a broken heart and coldly suppressed rage" [...] and calling the film [...] "a crash-bang Bond, high on action, low on quips, long on location glamour, short on product placement"; it concludes [...] "Quantum of Solace isn't as good as Casino Royale: the smart elegance of Craig's Bond debut has been toned down in favour of conventional action. But the man himself powers this movie; he carries the film: it's an indefinably difficult task for an actor. Craig measures up." ...|$|E

2500|$|Back in Portugal, {{the news}} of the defeat at Tangier and the {{subsequent}} treaty were received with shock. John of Reguengos immediately set sail for Asilah, hoping to negotiate Ferdinand's release in return for Salah ibn Salah's son (still being held hostage by Henry), but to no avail. [...] The question of what to do divided Ferdinand's older brothers. Ceuta was highly symbolic – the brothers had been made knights there when their father conquered the city back in 1415. [...] Peter of Coimbra, who had been adamantly opposed to the whole Tangier expedition to begin with, urged their eldest brother, King Edward of Portugal, to fulfill the treaty immediately, order the evacuation of Ceuta and secure Ferdinand's release. [...] But Edward was caught in indecision. Henry the Navigator, who stayed in Ceuta, depressed and incommunicado after the defeat in Tangier, eventually dispatched letters to Edward counseling against ratifying the treaty he had himself negotiated and suggesting other ways of getting Ferdinand released without surrendering Ceuta. [...] But Ferdinand himself wrote letters to Edward and Henry from Asilah noting that the Marinids were not likely to release him for anything less than Ceuta, urging them to fulfill the treaty and <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> delay was.|$|E
2500|$|One common way of {{reconciling}} {{these two}} opposing forces {{is simply to}} exempt all gene and protein symbols from the glossing rule. This is certainly fast and easy to do, and in highly specialized journals, it is also justified because the entire target [...] has high subject matter expertise. (Experts are not confused {{by the presence of}} symbols (whether known or novel) and they know where to look them up online for further details if needed.) But for journals with broader and more general target readerships, this action leaves the readers without any explanatory annotation and can leave them <b>wondering</b> <b>what</b> <b>the</b> apparent-abbreviation stands for and why it was not explained. Therefore, a good alternative solution is simply to put either the official gene name or a suitable short description (gene alias/other designation) in parentheses after the first use of the official gene/protein symbol. This meets both the formal requirement (the presence of a gloss) and the functional requirement (helping the reader to know what the symbol refers to). The same guideline applies to shorthand names for sequence variations; AMA says, [...] "In general medical publications, textual explanations should accompany the shorthand terms at first mention." [...] Thus [...] "188del11" [...] is glossed as [...] "an 11-bp deletion at nucleotide 188." [...] This corollary rule (which forms an adjunct to the spell-everything-out rule) often also follows the [...] "abbreviation-leading" [...] style of expansion that is becoming more prevalent in recent years. Traditionally, the abbreviation always followed the fully expanded form in parentheses at first use. This is still the general rule. But for certain classes of abbreviations or acronyms (such as clinical trial acronyms [...] or standardized polychemotherapy regimens [...] ), this pattern may be reversed, because the short form is more widely used and the expansion is merely parenthetical to the discussion at hand. The same is true of gene/protein symbols.|$|E
