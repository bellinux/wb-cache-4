[...] She released a demo version of the song, which was then called [...] "I Don't Know", onto her Myspace account, along with another song, [...] "I Could Say", in April 2008. The singer declared about the inspiration for the song, which has to do with materialism and the pressures of being rich and famous: [...] tell you where the inspiration for it came from. I was walking down this street, in this village {{in the middle of the}} countryside in the U.K., and there was this little girl who must have been eight or nine, walking down the street with her mum in, like, high-waisted hot pants and a little crop top. And I just thought, 'That's not really right.' And I could tell she was the kind of girl that would be trying out for Pop Idol in five years time, and wants to be famous when she grows up. And there's definitely the whole culture of that <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>from,</b> and it's not necessarily a culture that I think is particularly healthy.

2500|$|In 1940, Lomax and {{his close}} friend Nicholas Ray {{went on to}} write and produce a fifteen-minute program, Back Where I Came From, which aired {{three nights a week}} on CBS and {{featured}} folk tales, proverbs, prose, and sermons, as well as songs, organized thematically. Its racially integrated cast included Burl Ives, Lead Belly, Josh White, Sonny Terry, and Brownie McGhee. In February 1941, Lomax spoke and gave a demonstration of his program along with talks by Nelson A. Rockefeller from the Pan American Union, {{and the president of the}} American Museum of Natural History, at a global conference in Mexico of a thousand broadcasters CBS had sponsored to launch its worldwide programming initiative. Mrs. Roosevelt invited Lomax to Hyde Park. But despite its success and high visibility, Back <b>Where</b> <b>I</b> <b>Come</b> <b>From</b> never picked up a commercial sponsor. The show ran for only twenty-one weeks before it was suddenly canceled in February, 1941. On hearing the news Woody Guthrie wrote Lomax from California, [...] "Too honest again, I suppose? Maybe not purty enough. O well, this country's a getting to where it can't hear its own voice. Someday the deal will change." [...] Lomax himself wrote that in all his work he had tried to capture [...] "the seemingly incoherent diversity of American folk song as an expression of its democratic, inter-racial, international character, as a function of its inchoate and turbulent many-sided development.|$|E

[...] It's been 5 years since Robyn and I didn't want to wait with a release until they are all recorded, so I decided to start putting them out right away." [...] Robyn told Popjustice journalist Peter Robinson, [...] "It's {{been a long time}} since I actually made a record! And I was thinking of how to shorten that time down and Eric, my manager, came up with the idea of what if I just start releasing songs, then I can tour them, then I can make some more songs. We started working like that. I think once it starts it will make more sense– you can just keep releasing stuff without the long breaks." [...] Robyn collaborated with Swedish producer Max Martin on the song [...] "Time Machine". Martin was responsible for producing Robyn's US breakthrough hits [...] "Do You Know (What It Takes)" [...] and [...] "Show Me Love", which both charted inside the top ten of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1996 and 1997. She said of the collaboration: [...] "It was nostalgic to go back into the studio together. For me, it’s perfect timing– I’ve come full circle.

2500|$|Seeger {{enrolled}} at Harvard College on a partial scholarship, {{but as he}} became increasingly involved with politics and folk music, his grades suffered and he lost his scholarship. He {{dropped out of college}} in 1938. He dreamed of a career in journalism and took courses in art, as well. His first musical gig was leading students in folk singing at the Dalton School, where his aunt was principal. He polished his performance skills during a summer stint of touring New York State with The Vagabond Puppeteers (Jerry Oberwager, 22; Mary Wallace, 22; and Harriet Holtzman, 23), a traveling puppet theater [...] "inspired by rural education campaigns of post-revolutionary Mexico". One of their shows coincided with a strike by dairy farmers. The group reprised its act in October in New York City. An article in the October 2, 1939, Daily Worker reported on the Puppeteers' six-week tour this way:During the entire trip the group never ate once in a restaurant. They slept out at night under the stars and cooked their own meals in the open, very often they were the guests of farmers. At rural affairs and union meetings, the farm women would bring [...] "suppers" [...] and would vie with each other to see who could feed the troupe most, and after the affair the farmers would have earnest discussions about who would have the honor of taking them home for the night."They fed us too well," [...] the girls reported. [...] "And we could live the entire winter just by taking advantage of all the offers to spend a week on the farm."In the farmers' homes they talked about politics and the farmers’ problems, about antisemitism and Unionism, about war and peace and social security—"and always," [...] the puppeteers report, [...] "the farmers wanted to know {{what can be done to}} create a stronger unity between themselves and city workers. They felt the need of this more strongly than ever before, and the support of the CIO in their milk strike has given them a new understanding and a new respect for the power that lies in solidarity. One summer has convinced us that a minimum of organized effort on the part of city organizations—unions, consumers' bodies, the American Labor Party and similar groups—can not only reach the farmers but weld them into a pretty solid front with city folks that will be one of the best guarantees for progress. That fall Seeger took a job in Washington, D.C., assisting Alan Lomax, a friend of his father's, at the Archive of American Folk Song of the Library of Congress. Seeger's job was to help Lomax sift through commercial [...] "race" [...] and [...] "hillbilly" [...] music and select recordings that best represented American folk music, a project funded by the music division of the Pan American Union (later the Organization of American States), of whose music division his father, Charles Seeger, was head (1938–53). Lomax also encouraged Seeger's folk singing vocation, and Seeger was soon appearing as a regular performer on Alan Lomax and Nicholas Ray's weekly Columbia Broadcasting show Back <b>Where</b> <b>I</b> <b>Come</b> <b>From</b> (1940–41) alongside Josh White, Burl Ives, Lead Belly, and Woody Guthrie (whom he had first met at Will Geer's Grapes of Wrath benefit concert for migrant workers on March 3, 1940). Back <b>Where</b> <b>I</b> <b>Come</b> <b>From</b> was unique in having a racially integrated cast, which made news when it performed in March 1941 at a command performance at the White House organized by Eleanor Roosevelt called [...] "An Evening of Songs for American Soldiers," [...] before an audience that included the Secretaries of War, Treasury, and the Navy, among other notables. The show was a success but was not picked up by commercial sponsors for nationwide broadcasting because of its integrated cast.
