5|$|Structure 7B {{is a small}} {{structure}} {{situated on}} the eastern side of Structure 7. Like Structure 7A, the four sides were dressed with standing stones and <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a pavement.|$|E
5|$|The main {{structure}} and the keep <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a ditch, which had three counterscarp musketry galleries. These were also significantly altered by the British.|$|E
5|$|The outworks <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> by an {{advanced}} ditch, {{but only a}} part of it remains since most of it was filled in with rubble.|$|E
5|$|If {{the king}} <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> {{on all four}} sides by enemies, he is taken prisoner. If he <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> on three sides, he may escape by the fourth.|$|R
5000|$|It has block-oriented control structures, {{similar to}} those in the C, JavaScript, and Java {{programming}} languages. Conditions <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> by parentheses, and controlled blocks <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> by braces: ...|$|R
50|$|As {{the germ}} of a fruit <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by the {{perisperm}} so the spirit, properly so called, <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by an envelope which, by analogy, may be {{designated as the}} perispirit.|$|R
5|$|An {{unexpected}} {{bonus of}} the Bruneval raid was the Germans' {{efforts to improve}} defences at Würzburg stations and prevent similar attacks. The radars <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> by rings of barbed wire which increased their visibility from the air, making them easier to target prior to Operation Overlord.|$|E
5|$|French forces not {{retreating}} {{with the}} Guard <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> in their positions and eliminated, neither side asking for nor offering quarter. The French Young Guard Division reported 96per cent casualties, and two-thirds of Lobau's Corps ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|That night, 200,000 {{troops and}} 2,000 tanks entered the country. They first {{occupied}} the Ruzyně International Airport, where air deployment of more troops was arranged. The Czechoslovak forces {{were confined to}} their barracks, which <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> until {{the threat of a}} counter-attack was assuaged. By the morning of 21 August Czechoslovakia was occupied.|$|E
50|$|An ambulacrum is an {{architectural}} {{term for the}} atrium, courtyard, or parvise {{in front of a}} basilica that <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by arcades or colonnades, often containing a fountain, and <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by trees.|$|R
50|$|The lake {{is mainly}} for {{decorative}} purposes and has four fountains. It has a dock and <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a sidewalk. The lake {{and the entire}} condominium complex <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> by Casablanca Drive.|$|R
50|$|The island {{itself is}} covered with trees but it <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a beach around which is a lagoon. Outside this, the whole <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a coral reef and the open ocean.|$|R
5|$|A {{force of}} commandos landed to destroy {{machinery}} and other structures. Heavy German gunfire sank, set ablaze, or immobilised {{virtually all the}} small craft intended to transport the commandos back to England; the commandos had to fight their way out through the town to try to escape overland. Almost all were forced to surrender when their ammunition was expended and they <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> and captured by the Wehrmacht defending Saint-Nazaire.|$|E
5|$|After Napoleon's departure, French troops {{held off}} British and Ottoman attacks for another 18 months. In March 1801, the British landed at Aboukir Bay. Menou {{was now in}} command of the French expedition. His troops, {{including}} the Commission, marched north towards the Mediterranean coast to meet the enemy, transporting the stone along with many other antiquities. He was defeated in battle, and the remnant of his army retreated to Alexandria where they <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> and besieged, the stone now inside the city. Menou surrendered on August 30.|$|E
5|$|By 2:00 AM {{the entire}} army was in motion roughly along Quaker Bridge Road through {{what is now}} Hamilton Township. The men were ordered to march with {{absolute}} silence. Along the way, a rumor was spread that they <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> and some frightened militiamen fled for Philadelphia. The march was difficult, {{as some of the}} route ran through thick woods and it was icy, causing horses to slip, and men to break through ice on ponds.|$|E
50|$|Mannar is the {{one among}} the {{beautiful}} place in Kerala, because the southern side <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by paddy fields and eastern side surrounded by the river and north and west <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by hills.|$|R
2500|$|The {{virus is}} {{approximately}} 122–180 nm {{in diameter and}} is composed of a double helix of DNA which contains about 172,000 base pairs and 85 genes. The DNA <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a protein nucleocapsid. This nucleocapsid <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a tegument made of protein, which in turn <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by an [...] envelope containing both lipids and surface projections of glycoproteins which are essential to infection of the host cell.|$|R
50|$|Bath {{is one of}} {{only two}} UK Parliament {{constituencies}} to <b>be</b> <b>surrounded</b> by another constituency. Bath <b>is</b> entirely <b>surrounded</b> by the North East Somerset constituency. The other constituency, York Central, <b>is</b> entirely <b>surrounded</b> by York Outer.|$|R
5|$|During the attacks, both hotels <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> by Rapid Action Force {{personnel}} and Marine Commandos (MARCOS) and National Security Guards (NSG) commandos. When reports emerged that attackers were receiving television broadcasts, feeds to the hotels were blocked. Security forces stormed both hotels, and all nine attackers {{were killed by}} the morning of 29 November. Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan of the NSG was killed during the rescue of Commando Sunil Yadav, who was hit in the leg by a bullet during the rescue operations at Taj. 32 hostages were killed at the Oberoi Trident.|$|E
5|$|Famously, {{the much}} smaller Greek army held the pass of Thermopylae against the Persians {{for three days}} before being outflanked by a {{mountain}} path. Much of the Greek army retreated, before the Spartans and Thespians who had continued to block the pass <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> and killed. The simultaneous Battle of Artemisium was {{up to that point}} a stalemate; however, when news of Thermopylae reached them, the Allied fleet also retreated, since holding the straits of Artemisium was now a moot point.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Forbes {{stated the}} cere {{was covered by}} {{feathers}} which concealed the nostrils. This contradicts other accounts that mention that the nostrils <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> by red skin. Forbes based his description on the Paris specimen which had previously had its skull and mandible removed for study by the French zoologist Alphonse Milne-Edwards. This {{may have led to}} the distortion of the shape of the head and nostrils as indicated by the illustration in Forbes' article.|$|E
50|$|Na2Te, {{like many}} related {{compounds}} with the formula M2X, adopts the antifluorite structure. Thus, in solid Na2Te each Te2− ion <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by eight Na+ ions and each Na+ ion <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by four Te2− ions.|$|R
50|$|Kuruman has {{relatively}} mild {{weather patterns}} {{compared to other}} Northern Cape towns, such as Upington and Springbok, and <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by more vegetation {{as compared to the}} Upington and Springbok, which <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> by desertic environments.|$|R
50|$|The last {{assumption}} {{means that}} each cation <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a spherically symmetric cloud of other ions. The cloud has a net negative charge. Similarly each anion <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a cloud with net positive charge.|$|R
5|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, Isdud was {{described}} as a village spread across the eastern slope of a low hill, covered with gardens. A ruined khan stood southwest of the village. Its houses were one-storey high with walls and enclosures built of adobe brick. There were two main sources of water: a pond and a masonry well. Both <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> by groves of date-palm and fig-trees.|$|E
5|$|In the {{meantime}} fighting between the rebels and the Byzantines continued. Although the Bulgarian forces were cut in two following the Byzantine landing at Varna, heavy clashes {{erupted in the}} eastern Balkan mountains with new vigour, especially around the Kotel Pass and the Varbitsa Pass. The Bulgarian positions there <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> both {{from the north and}} the south. The Byzantines had to besiege and take the fortresses one by one which cost time and casualties. Many strongholds remained unconquered and permanently engaged large Byzantine forces.|$|E
5|$|Nabis had {{appointed}} his brother-in-law, the Argive Pythagoras, {{as commander}} of his garrison of 15,000 men in Argos. As the Romans and the Achaean League were advancing towards the city, a young Argive named Damocles attempted {{to stir up}} a revolution against the Spartan garrison. With a few followers, {{he stood in the}} city's agora and shouted to his fellow Argives, exhorting them to rise in revolt. However, no mass uprising materialized and Damocles and most of his followers <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> and killed by the Spartan garrison.|$|E
2500|$|Spread over a hillside, {{the complex}} <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by cedar trees, some [...] tall and {{as old as}} the temple. It <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by bright green moss-covered boulders, and Japanese maples that turn red and gold during autumn.|$|R
50|$|The Justizwache corps badge {{shows the}} Austrian coat of arms, which <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a {{circular}} enclosure. It thus deviates only marginally from the corps badge of the Federal Police, {{in which the}} Bundeswappen <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by an oak leaf wreath.|$|R
50|$|In {{the earlier}} Geordie lamps an oil lamp <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by glass. The {{top of the}} glass has a {{perforated}} copper cap with a gauze screen above that. The glass <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a perforated metal tube to protect it.|$|R
5|$|One {{result of}} the brigades' {{scattered}} landing was that several small groups of men caused havoc among the Germans, ambushing men and vehicles. One lone sergeant arrived at brigade headquarters with eighty prisoners, having convinced them that they <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> and should surrender. The 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion's 'B' Company, which had landed on the correct drop zone, ambushed a convoy of five trucks, killing twelve Germans, then assaulted a château, killing another thirty men before the surviving fifty surrendered.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantines <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> {{from all}} sides now. Some fell into the deep ravines off the steep slopes, others tried to escape in the waters, only to be smashed on the rocks below and again others were killed in their flight. Nevertheless, {{a large number of}} the {{soldiers}} managed to escape the slaughter. Jonah, the Greek informant of the Rashidun army during the conquest of Damascus, died in this battle. The Muslims took no prisoners in this battle, although they may have captured some during the subsequent pursuit.|$|E
5|$|The first {{high-resolution}} electron micrographs {{appeared in}} 1952, replacing the Janus Green stains as the preferred way of visualising the mitochondria. This {{led to a}} more {{detailed analysis of the}} structure of the mitochondria, including confirmation that they <b>were</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a membrane. It also showed a second membrane inside the mitochondria that folded up in ridges dividing up the inner chamber and that the size and shape of the mitochondria varied from cell to cell.|$|E
5000|$|As {{defined by}} Presidential Proclamation No. 296 which created it, the Upper Marikina Watershed Protected Landscape <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> with other {{reservations}} and protected areas {{on all sides}} except the south, where it <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by [...] "alienable and disposable lands." ...|$|R
50|$|An axon is {{the part}} of a neuron which conducts {{electrical}} impulses. Axons <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> by myelin, which contain Schwann cells. Schwann cells improve the electrical conduction. The myelin <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by endoneurium, which is a protective sheath of connective tissue. This <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by perineurium and epineurium, of which the latter is the outmost layer of dense connective tissue. When it comes to nerve repair, it is crucial that those layers make a good connection.|$|R
50|$|Eutin <b>is</b> <b>surrounded</b> by {{a number}} of lakes of the Holsteinische Schweiz, {{including}} the Großer Eutiner See, Kleiner Eutiner See, Kellersee and Ukleisee. Many of the lakes <b>are</b> <b>surrounded</b> by forests. Popular activities on these lakes include boating, canoeing, rowing, swimming, and fishing.|$|R
