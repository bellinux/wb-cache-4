In Spielberg's version, these invaders had been here before, long ago, in prehistoric times. They had set up their machines deep underground, and departed. Why? <b>Why</b> <b>not</b> <b>take</b> over the Earth right there and then? Spielberg does not provide an answer, and the characters are too busy surviving to wonder about this. An answer suggests itself - a very chilling answer. The invaders were interested in humans as food animals. When they came here before, humans were very scarce. The aliens left their hidden machines and departed, patiently observing the Earth until humans would multiply to the requisite numbers - and then they came back, to take over. Under this interpretation, all of us - all humans over the whole of history - have been livestock living in an alien food farm, destined to be 'harvested'".|$|E

2500|$|On Drosnin's {{claim of}} Rabin's death, Drosnin {{wrote in his}} book [...] "The Bible Code" [...] (published in 1997) on page 120; [...] "Yigal Amir {{could not be found}} in advance". This is very telling in that {{dangerous}} period of Israeli politics from the Oslo Accords of 1993 to the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin on November 4, 1995. Critics have noted a huge error in the [...] "code" [...] Drosnin claimed to have found: Drosnin misused the Biblical verse Deuteronomy 4:42. Scholars note; [...] "For example, citing again the passage intersecting with Rabin: that passage is from Deuteronomy 4:42, but Drosnin ignores the words immediately following [...] "a murderer who will murder." [...] What comes next is the phrase [...] "unwittingly" [...] (biveli da'at). This is because the verse deals with the cities of refuge where accidental killers can find asylum. In this case, then, the message would refer to an accidental killing of (or by) Rabin and it would therefore be wrong. Another message (p.71) supposedly contains a [...] "complete" [...] description of the terrorist bombing of a bus in Jerusalem on February 25, 1996. It includes the phrase [...] "fire, great noise," [...] but overlooks the fact that the letters which make up those two words are actually part of a larger phrase from Genesis 35:4 which says: [...] "under the terebinth that was near Shechem."
