25|$|<b>We</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{proposed}} Harvard library transition as {{a manifestation}} of the University's accession to neoliberal imperatives. Occupy, whether at Harvard or Wall Street, challenges and refuses the devastating willingness of our broken society to view humans as expendable resources and systems as ultimately beholden to profit. A future cannot be imagined in the absence of its past, present, or future constituents. A library needs the workers who are its lifeblood, its circulatory system, just as a functioning democratic society needs the voices of the 99 percent. Systems built with profit imperatives can only serve to further perpetuate the patterns of destruction and unequal power structures that we denounce. The proposed library transition not only fails to address these systemic problems, it replicates them.|$|E

2500|$|Arnold's {{work as a}} {{literary}} critic began with the 1853 [...] "Preface to the Poems".

[...] With its emphasis {{on the importance of}} subject in poetry, on [...] "clearness of arrangement, rigor of development, simplicity of style" [...] learned from the Greeks, and in the strong imprint of Goethe and Wordsworth, may be observed nearly all the essential elements in his critical theory.

2500|$|In particular, it is {{well known}} that any {{discontinuities}} in a function reduce the rate of convergence of the Fourier series, so that more sinusoids are needed to represent the function with a given accuracy. [...] The same principle governs the usefulness of the DFT and other transforms for signal compression; the smoother a function is, the fewer terms in its DFT or DCT are required to represent it accurately, and the more it can be compressed. [...] (Here, <b>we</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> DFT or DCT as approximations for the Fourier series or cosine series of a function, respectively, in order to talk about its [...] "smoothness".) [...] However, the implicit periodicity of the DFT means that discontinuities usually occur at the boundaries: any random segment of a signal is unlikely to have the same value at both the left and right boundaries. [...] (A similar problem arises for the DST, in which the odd left boundary condition implies a discontinuity for any function that does not happen to be zero at that boundary.) [...] In contrast, a DCT where both boundaries are even always yields a continuous extension at the boundaries (although the slope is generally discontinuous). [...] This is why DCTs, and in particular DCTs of types I, II, V, and VI (the types that have two even boundaries) generally perform better for signal compression than DFTs and DSTs. [...] In practice, a type-II DCT is usually preferred for such applications, in part for reasons of computational convenience.|$|E
