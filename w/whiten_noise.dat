Although traveltimes extracted from such data have been extensively used to get images of the Earth interior, very few studies have attempted to exploit the amplitudes. In this work, we investigate the information contained in the amplitudes and we probe the capability of noise correlations to recover anelastic attenuation. To do so, we carry out numerical experiments in which we generate seismic noise at the surface of a 1 -D Earth model. One of the advantages of our approach is that both uniform and non-uniform distributions of noise sources can be taken into account. In the case of a uniform distribution, we find that geometrical spreading as well as intrinsic attenuation are retrieved, even after strong non-linear operations such as one-bit normalization and spectral whitening applied to the noise recordings. In the case of a non-uniform distribution of sources, the geometrical spreading of the raw noise correlations depends on the distribution, but intrinsic attenuation is preserved.

40|$|We {{propose a}} space-time {{receiver}} for trellis coded modulated (TCM) signals transmitted over a broadband wireless channel which {{is affected by}} both severe intersymbol interference (ISI) due to the multipath fading effects of the channel and co-channel interference (CCI) due {{to the presence of}} adjacent users. The proposed receiver consists of a broadband beamformer used for joint rejection of interfering users and shortening of the channel impulse response for the desired user, followed by a scalar turbo equalizer applied to the beamformer output for joint equalization/TCM decoding. The interference cancellation is achieved by viewing the combined effect of the CCI and of the white channel noise at each beamformer branch as colored noise, and by requiring that the beamformer should <b>whiten</b> this colored <b>noise</b> at its output so as to make trellis-based turbo equalization possible. With this <b>noise</b> <b>whitening</b> requirement, the beamformer design {{takes the form of a}} quadratically constrained quadratic optimization problem which is solved by using a Lagrangian relaxation approach.

As root-mean-square contrast increases, BOLD response to natural images is stronger and saturates more rapidly than response to the whitened images. Perceived contrast and BOLD fMRI responses are higher for pink noise than for white noise patterns, by the same ratio as between natural and whitened images. Spatial phase structure has no measurable effect on perceived contrast or BOLD fMRI response. The fMRI and perceived contrast response results can be described by models of spatial frequency response in V 1, that match the contrast sensitivity function at low contrasts, and have more uniform spatial frequency response at high contrasts...|$|R

40|$|A {{fractional}} iterative channel estimation {{and data}} detection {{algorithm is proposed}} for frequency selective, quasi-static MIMO channels. It is shown that due to the correlation of the noise samples after pulse matched filtering and sampling, {{the complexity of the}} derived receiver, based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm with fractional sampling, is {{the same as that of}} the ML receiver, which requires an exhaustive search. It is shown that by using a <b>noise</b> <b>whitening</b> filter to <b>whiten</b> the <b>noise</b> samples, the algorithm can be efficiently implemented using the Viterbi algorithm instead of using an exhaustive search technique. Due to spectral zeros of the autocorrelation function of the <b>noise</b> sequence, <b>noise</b> <b>whitening</b> filter designed by spectral factorization are not practical for the square-root raised cosine pulses and similar shapes. An alternative prediction-error whitening filter is proposed solving the Yule-Walker equations. We analyze the performance of the proposed receiver via numerical simulations. It is observed that when the channel is perfectly known, the performance of the fractional ML receiver, with five-tap whitening filter, is only 0. 5 dB worse than that of the optimal ML receiver at a BER of 10 - 4. When the path delays are fixed and the channel is unknown, the fractional iterative scheme outperforms the symbol rate iterative scheme between 0 and 16 dB, and between BERs of 2 x 10 - 1 and 2 x 10 - 4. With varying path delays, the fractional scheme is better for all simulated SNR values. However, both schemes experience a severe error flooring. Application of the EM algorithm to iteratively estimate frequency selective channels and detect the transmitted information sequence improves the efficiency of pilot symbols. By using additional iterations, the BER is lowered with the same number of pilot symbols. We also compare the performance of the iterative receiver that uses the correct tap covariance matrix with the one that assumes a diagonal covariance matrix. It is observed that with fixed path delays the performance is identical with both models. With varying path delays and fractional sampling the diagonal assumption results in a performance loss of 0. 5 dB. **This dissertation is a compound document (contains both a paper copy and a CD as part of the dissertation) ...|$|R
