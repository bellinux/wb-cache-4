5|$|Supportive {{therapy and}} diaphragmatic {{breathing}} has shown to cause improvement in 56% of cases, and total cessation of symptoms in an additional 30% {{in one study}} of 54 adolescent patients who were followed up 10 months after initial treatments. Patients who successfully use the technique often notice an immediate change in health for the better. Individuals who have had bulimia or who intentionally induced vomiting {{in the past have}} a reduced chance for improvement due to the reinforced behavior. The technique is not used with infants or young children due to the complex timing and concentration required for it to be successful. Most infants grow out of the disorder <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> with aversive training.|$|E
5|$|Whitehall's powers over Southern Rhodesia {{under the}} 1923 {{constitution}} were, on paper, considerable; the British Crown was theoretically able to cancel any passed bill <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>year,</b> <b>or</b> alter the constitution however it wished. These reserved powers {{were intended to}} protect the indigenous black Africans from discriminatory legislation and to safeguard British commercial interests in the colony, but as Claire Palley comments in her constitutional history of the country, {{it would have been}} extremely difficult for Whitehall to enforce such actions, and attempting to do so would have probably caused a crisis. In the event, they were never exercised. A generally co-operative relationship developed between Whitehall and the colonial government and civil service in Salisbury, and dispute was rare.|$|E
5|$|After the Great Uprising, the Prussians rose {{a number}} of times against the Knights, but these uprisings were much smaller in scale and posed no real danger to the Teutonic Knights, who could {{concentrate}} on further conquests. The number of uprisings is variously considered to be two or three.. They were suppressed <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> two and showed exhaustion and division of the Prussian tribes. The third uprising in 1276 was provoked by Skalmantas, leader of the Sudovians, who successfully raided Teutonic lands. The next year he, with help from the Lithuanians, led 4,000 men into the Culmerland (Chełmno Land). The uprising failed to spread after Theodoric, vogt of Sambia, convinced the Sambians not to join the insurrection; Natangians and Warmians had also accepted baptism and promised their loyalty to the Knights. The Pogesanians alone continued the fight and were crushed. Survivors with their Bartian chief escaped to Hrodna in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania where they joined some of the Bartians, Skalvians, and all of the Nadruvians, who fled there after the Great Uprising.|$|E

5|$|Like {{his father}} and {{brothers}} before him, Ted attended Harvard College. In his spring semester, {{he was assigned to}} the athlete-oriented Winthrop House, where his brothers had also lived. He was an offensive and defensive end on the freshman football team, with his play being characterized by his large size and fearless style. In his first semester, Kennedy and his classmates arranged to copy answers from another student during the final examination for a science class. At the end of his second semester in May 1951, Kennedy was anxious about maintaining his eligibility for athletics for the next year, and he had a classmate take his place at a Spanish language examination. The ruse was immediately discovered and both students were expelled for cheating. In a standard Harvard treatment for serious disciplinary cases, they were told they could apply for readmission <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> two if they demonstrated good behavior during that time.|$|E
5|$|Most bovids are polygynous. In a few species, {{individuals}} are monogamous, resulting in minimal male-male aggression and reduced selection for large body size in males. Thus, sexual dimorphism is almost absent. Females may be {{slightly larger than}} males, possibly due to competition among females for the acquisition of territories. This {{is the case in}} duikers and other small bovids. The time taken for the attainment of sexual maturity by either sex varies broadly among bovids. Sexual maturity may even precede or follow mating. For instance the impala males, though sexually mature by a year, can mate only after four years of age. On the contrary barbary sheep females may give birth to offspring even before they have gained sexual maturity. The delay in male sexual maturation is more visible in sexually dimorphic species, particularly the reduncines, probably due to competition among males. For instance, the blue wildebeest females become capable of reproduction <b>within</b> <b>a</b> <b>year</b> <b>or</b> two of birth, while the males become mature only when four years old.|$|E

In 1986 however, British Midland leased a BAC1-11 400 (G-WLAD) from Airways International Cymru, and this aircraft was mainly used on the Heathrow route in lieu of the usual DC9s which returned in 1987. In the following years, British Midland increased its operations from Leeds Bradford, and introduced other routes including Glasgow, Paris CDG and Brussels. When the DC9s were phased out, the Boeing 737 200 became a regular on the Heathrow route, and later the 737 300, 400, and 500 were all operated prior to the arrival of the newly acquired Fokker 100, which again was supplemented on quieter rotations by the smaller Fokker 70. Eventually the Airbus A319 became the standard equipment to Heathrow, but busier rotations saw the larger A320 and occasional A321 too. At its peak, British Midland operated up to 6 flights each way to and from Heathrow from Leeds Bradford, the final late-evening flight being operated on a smaller Embraer 145 Regional Jet.
