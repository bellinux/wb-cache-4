500|$|Players at both clubs {{received}} {{the news with}} apprehension. As Ley put it, [...] "When you merge two clubs into one, you cannot have a squad of 45." [...] The Oxford team learned of the impending merger and the new name from Smith {{in the dressing room}} at Belle Vue just before the match against Doncaster on 16 April. Mark Jones, one of the Oxford midfielders, recalled that the room [...] "went totally quiet", and that his first thought was that it might be hard to him to keep his place in the first team with Reading's players also on the books. According to Jones, Smith attempted to assuage the Oxford players' fears by telling them that [...] "we're only doing it so <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>buy</b> Kerry Dixon. All your places are safe". Alan Judge, the Reading goalkeeper, reported his team reacting in a similar way—indeed, he described the Reading players as even more worried as Oxford had far outperformed them in the League that season. Ley, who accompanied the Oxford team on the bus ride home after the game, recalled that the players were almost silent, their victory over Doncaster overshadowed by [...] "a feeling of incredulity, confusion, worry and fear".|$|E

The phrase implies that with knowledge or education one’s potential or abilities inform life will certainly increase. It is also used as a justification for a reluctant to share information as some form of advantage can be gained through the use or manipulation of knowledge. Knowledge itself {{can be used to}} directly manipulate the content of reality. In recent years, Facebook has become a significant powerful social network icon.

40|$|This article {{considers}} a zero-mean background risk that is uncorrelated with insurable losses, {{but is not}} necessarily statistically independent. In particular, {{the size of the}} background risk can vary in different insurable-loss states. We show how a prudent individual will buy either more insurance or less insurance than with no background risk, depending on the relative size of the background risk in the loss states vis-á-vis the no-loss states. If we consider two individuals, with one more risk averse than the other, we need to compare the intensities of their precautionary motives, in addition to their measures of risk aversion, before <b>we</b> <b>can</b> determine who <b>buys</b> more insurance coverage {{in the presence of the}} state dependent background risk.

40|$|Existing {{magnetic}} cards adopt plain text to store confidential information, thus being vulnerable to an untrusted {{credit card reader}} or a skimming device. To tackle the problem, researchers have proposed several new techniques such as integrated circuit card (IC card) and mobile wallet applications; however, none of them can support existing magnetic card readers thereby facing backwards compatibility issue. In this paper, to combat such credit card information leakages and remain backwards compatible, we propose SafePay, a system that transforms disposable credit card information to electrical current and drives a magnetic card chip to simulate {{the behavior of a}} physical magnetic card. We have implemented a prototype system of SafePay by a mobile phone and a prototype magnetic card chip. In the evaluation, we show that the current cost is about 0. 5 excluding the phone, and the cost can be even lowered if manufactured in large scale. We also evaluated the prototype in experimental environment such as oscilloscope and real-world scenarios such as vending machines. The results show that the physical signal in oscilloscope {{is the same as the}} theoretical value, and meanwhile, <b>we</b> <b>can</b> successfully <b>buy</b> products in all the tested real-world scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Main Memory Database Systems (MMDBs) {{have been}} studied since the 80 s [3, 4], when memory was quite costly ($ 1500 per MByte in 1984). <b>We</b> <b>can</b> now <b>buy</b> memory for about $ 10 per GByte. An {{advantage}} of MMDBs is that serial execution of a non-distributed transaction on a uniprocessor {{from start to finish}} saves the work of disk I/O, locking, latching and deadlock handling [7]. The 2013 Bulletin on Data Engineering [11] had eight articles on recent MMDBs and only three mentioned distributed transactions. Implementing fast, serializable, distributed transactions on an MMDB is difficult, since communication delays typically leave some CPUs idle and reduce total throughput. We began a project in Fall 2011 to improve distributed transactional performance of the open-source MMDB VoltDB system [14], which was based on an earlier academic prototype MMDB H-Store [1]. We developed a low-overhead concurrency method that executes consecutive Prepares with delayed Commits on each node (CPU) and takes Write locks but not Read locks to detect conflicts. We developed an Ordered Escrow Method, a variant of Escrow [14] to greatly speed up transactions with incremental updates. We named our VoltDB modification CVoltDB (C for Concurrency) and proved it supports replica consistency and serializability. Full TPC-B and TPC-C benchmarks demonstrate greatly improved performance due to new features in CVoltDB...|$|R
