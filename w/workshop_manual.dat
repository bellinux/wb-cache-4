5000|$|The Haynes Owner's <b>Workshop</b> <b>Manuals</b> (commonly {{known as}} simply Haynes Manuals) are {{a series of}} {{practical}} manuals from the British publisher Haynes Publishing Group (...) [...] The series primarily focuses upon the maintenance and repair of automotive vehicles, covering a wide range of makes and models (300 models of car and 130 models of motorcycle); the manuals are aimed mainly at DIY enthusiasts rather than professional garage mechanics, as they lack the depth of coverage on particular vehicles or problems. The series includes manuals in the same style for domestic appliances and personal computers, digital photography, model railways, men andbabies,sex, and women.

50|$|Originally {{the cars}} were built at the Vanden Plas works in Kingsbury Lane, London, from bodyshells made by Park Sheet Metals Company {{assembling}} panels supplied by Motor Panels of Coventry and by Pressed Steel Fisher. Early limousines bore the 'Daimler Vanden Plas' designation on treadplates and <b>workshop</b> <b>manuals.</b> The Kingsbury Plant was closed in 1979 and production moved to Jaguar in Coventry, where it continued until 1992. The move to Coventry also brought the third and most extensive facelift in the car's life, when larger bumpers and a revised rear number-plate surround were fitted. The previous facelift occurred in 1972, modernizing the window arrangement for the rear passengers, namely how the previous design's opera windows having a split with one portion that could be rolled {{up and down and}} one static, being replaced with one single window that could be rolled up and down. It also addressed the corrosion issue of earlier cars (which related to this previous opera windows), slightly changed the dimensions of the grill and badge placement on the exterior, and lessened the amount of woodwork in the interior. The third and final facelift was made in 1987 with the arrival of new plastic bumpers and minor changes to the interior. This last model known as MkIV was produced until 1992, when Jaguar/Daimler ceased production of their last coachbuilt limousine.|$|R

Visions of Resilience was led by the Victorian Eco-Innovation Lab (VEIL) and funded by the Australian Government through the Victorian Department of Justice (Natural Disaster Resilience Grant Scheme). Results are drawn from two Victorian case studies in Anglesea and Creswick and interviews with emergency management and climate change adaptation practitioners. The case studies tested a participatory design-led process where communities explored local vulnerabilities to climate extremes and proposed desirable mechanisms to build local resilience. Workshops with community and agency stakeholders then explored pathways and barriers to create these future &# 039;visions of resilience&# 039;.

40|$|The {{overarching}} goal of {{this project}} is to offer the counselling community strategies to promote a gay-affirmative approach to same-sex intimate partner violence (IPV). Four goals are associated with this project: (a) encourage counsellors {{to become aware of}} their personal attitudes towards homosexuality and same-sex IPV, (b) educate counsellors about appropriate terminology when referencing topics associated with same-sex IPV, (c) compare and contrast same-sex IPV, and (d) address counsellors’ ethical responsibilities when working with victims of same-sex IPV. These goals were met by creating a 6. 5 -hour face-to-face workshop for human service professionals interested in learning more about same sex IPV.

40|$|The {{intent of}} this {{manuscript}} is to inform others about stress, parental stress, and highlight {{the negative consequences of}} stress on children by directly providing information to parents of infant and preschool children {{in the form of a}} psychoeducational workshop. Given that the early years of life have many critical periods of development and that during these years children are especially vulnerable to the exposure of stress, early intervention to reduce the damage from stress is of high importance. This project is comprised of two parts. Part 1 includes a literature review that guides and provides in-depth information to support Part 2 of this project. Part 2 of the project is a standalone manual for three workshops that counsellors and facilitators can use to educate parents about the impact of stress on children and equip them to recognize and reduce the impact of stress on themselves and their children. The <b>workshop</b> <b>manual</b> includes three comprehensive lesson plans, handouts, activities, and detailed facilitator instructions.

40|$|Within {{the last}} decades, product {{development}} industry has found itself facing a general increase in product use problems. These problems originate from a mismatch between the actual functionality {{that the product}} provides and the afforded product-user interaction versus the user’s expectations regarding both aspects. A lot of these problems find their origin in an ineffective and inefficient organisation of the product development process. An effective and efficient organisation of such a process usually starts with the specification of a detailed plan of approach. Unfortunately there are no tools to support product development teams in specifying a univocal, effective and user-centred Plan of approach. This research therefore focused {{the development of a}} method that supports product development teams in specifying a univocal and detailed user-centred plan of approach for a specific product development project. The research resulted in the UCD Kick-off method. Input for this method is a design brief. Output of the method is a detailed user-centred plan of approach describing project stakeholders, product’s intended use characteristics, intermediate results, selected development methods, development activities, required input and allocation of resources. The method is characterised by the following four iterative steps in order to specify these aspects. 1. 	Stakeholder mapping: Making a complete prioritised overview and specification of project stakeholders (including the product’s users). 2. 	Product characteristics and intermediate results: Making a overview of product characteristics, scheduled intermediate development results and contextual conditions. 3. 	Development method selection: Explicitly exploring and selecting feasible development methods which lead to the desired development results. 4. 	Development method specification: Describing required development activities, required input, development techniques and allocation of resources. The UCD Kick-off method has been validated and evaluated in cooperation with industrial partners. These validation and evaluation resulted in a <b>workshop</b> <b>manual,</b> the UCD Kick-off tool, which supports in executing a series of workshops in which product development teams to jointly apply the UCD Kick-off method. The evaluation furthermore revealed that the UCD Kick-off method and accompanying UCD Kick-off tool are assessed to be applicable in and of added value to product development practice...|$|E

40|$|The {{population}} in the United States is aging and with the aging population {{is an increase in}} the prevalence of Alzheimer?s disease and other dementias. Alzheimer?s disease and other dementias put a great demand on the healthcare system. One approach to addressing the demand on the healthcare system is to address the knowledge and abilities of caregivers of people with Alzheimer?s disease and other dementias. The literature reveals that caregivers have insufficient knowledge and training in regards to caring for people with dementia. The Alzheimer?s Disease & Other Dementias Caregiver <b>Workshop</b> Facilitator <b>Manual</b> is a tool developed to facilitate and support the ongoing education of professional caregivers at the Beaver Dam Community Hospital in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin.
