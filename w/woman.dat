40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to test the extent to which <b>women</b> who self-objectify also objectify other <b>women.</b> One hundred thirty-two university students and their friends (64 <b>women</b> and 68 men) completed three questionnaires: (1) Noll and Fredrickson’s (1998) Self-Objectification Questionnaire, (2) a modified version of that questionnaire that measured individuals’ objectification of others, and (3) Slade, Dewey, Newton, and Brodie’s (1990) Body Cathexis scale. <b>Women</b> were {{more likely than men to}} self-objectify. Self-objectification was negatively related to body satisfaction for <b>women</b> but not for men. Both <b>women</b> and men objectified <b>women</b> more than they objectified men, although women’s objectification of other <b>women</b> was not significantly different than their objectification of men. Men objectified <b>women</b> more than <b>women</b> did, and <b>women</b> objectified men more than men did. <b>Women</b> were more likely to objectify other <b>women</b> than to objectify themselves. Higher self-objectification among both <b>women</b> and men was related to increased objectification of other <b>women</b> and men, but the relationships were stronger for <b>women.</b> Results indicate that <b>women</b> also objectify <b>women,</b> although not to the degree exhibited by men...|$|R

Underground, he finds Hangemuhl and takes her to the hospital. Skinner checks in with Doggett who reports that Hangemuhl's kidneys have healed spontaneously. Doggett returns to the <b>woman</b> in the woods who watches over the creature; after recoiling at its ugliness, the <b>woman</b> explains that it looks {{the way it does}} because it takes the sickness of others into itself, while healing them in the process. Doggett decides to take the creature away from the society, which only uses it. However, Doggett is shot and killed in a scuffle with the sheriff and is promptly buried. Later, Doggett awakens in the tunnels. In the dark corner of the cavern, the <b>woman</b> kneels beside the dead soul eater. She weeps over it, revealing that, by eating Doggett's death, it has finally been allowed to die.|$|E
