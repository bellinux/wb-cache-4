Based on the Kane-Mele model, we derive two coupled equations for the energy and the effective <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>edge</b> states at a given momentum in a semi-infinite honeycomb lattice with a zigzag boundary. It is revealed that, in a one-dimensional Brillouin zone, the edge states merge into the continuous bands of the bulk states through a bifurcation of the edge-state width. We discuss {{the implications of the}} results to the experiments in monolayer or thin films of topological insulators. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} the study of {{vibration}} and dynamic instability characteristics of laminated composite doubly curved panels, subjected to non-uniform follower load, using finite element approach. First order shear deformation theory is used to model the doubly curved panels, considering the effects of shear deformation and rotary inertia. The formulation {{is based on the}} extension of dynamic, shear deformable theory according to Sanders’ first approximation for doubly curved laminated shells, which can be reduced to Love’s and Donnell’s theories by means of tracers. The modal transformation technique is applied {{to reduce the number of}} equilibrium equations for subsequent analysis. Structural damping is introduced into the system in terms of viscous damping. Instability behaviour of curved panels have been examined considering the various parameters such as <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>edge</b> load, load direction control, damping, influence of fiber orientation and lay up sequence etc. The results show that under follower loading the panel may lose its stability due to either flutter or divergence, depending on the system parameters...|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} {{experimentally}} the <b>widths</b> and positions <b>of</b> <b>edge</b> channels in an inhomogeneous {{two-dimensional electron gas}} (2 DEG) under quantum Hall conditions. The locations and <b>widths</b> <b>of</b> the <b>edge</b> channels are controlled by a low mobility two-dimensional hole gas (2 DHG) in between the GaAs substrate and the 2 DEG, which acts as an interior gate. This 2 DHG- 2 DEG system works as a p-i-n photodiode. A lateral photovoltage develops across two contacts attached to the 2 DEG, when the structure is illuminated locally. By modulating the illuminated area with respect to position, the differential lateral photovoltage is obtained. We present such measurements {{as a function of}} the spot position in a sample under quantum Hall conditions. Two-dimensional images made across large areas of the Hall bar clearly show the edge channels.

30|$|The mixed-pixel {{fraction}} is {{a function}} of not only the length but also the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> MPZs (Fig.  11). In images, the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> <b>edges</b> between two different objects (i.e. the MPZ width in the present study) decreases with the increase of image sharpness (Allen and Triantaphillidou 2011; Smith 1997) (Fig.  11). As mentioned in the introduction, even with optically-perfect lens, MPZs are at least as wide as one pixel due to the grid pixel system of digital images (Fisher 1997). Because image resolution of the image capturing devices in many up-to-date digital cameras exceeds that of lens ([URL] 20 th April, 2017), blurred SCBs caused by lens imperfections are recorded in details, resulting in that MPZs are even wider. In addition, image sharpness is also influenced by the image-processing algorithms of camera firmware and operation errors during image acquisition (Allen and Triantaphillidou 2011) (Fig.  11). Effects of lens and firmware can be controlled by using the same hard- and soft-ware respectively. In contrast, effects of operations during image acquisition can vary greatly shot by shot. When taking CHPs, HP users should minimise the commonly-encountered operation errors, including focusing failure, smudged lens, canopy movement caused by wind and camera shake (Fig.  11).|$|R

40|$|Models for the {{suppression}} of turbulence in the L to H transition, suggest that the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the H-mode <b>edge</b> barrier is either proportional or is {{of the order of}} the ion poloidal Larmor radius. This would require that the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>edge</b> barrier should depend on the plasma current. This dependence has been clearly verified at JET in experiments designed to control the <b>edge</b> MHD stability <b>of</b> ELM-free hot-ion H-mode plasmas. The effects of isotopic mass and the applicability <b>of</b> several <b>edge</b> barrier models to the hot-ion H-mode plasmas were analysed in using a large database containing both Deuterium-only (DD) and Deuterium-Tritium (DT) plasmas. This database has now been enlarged to include discharges from a plasma shape scan, allowing to study the dependence of the pedestal height on the edge shear. In addition the range of plasma currents was extended up to 6 MA. It is shown that the edge data is best described by a model where the edge barrier width is determined by the fast ions weighted towards the components with largest poloidal Larmor radii.

The proposed measure for any edge point is obtained by combining the standard deviation <b>of</b> the <b>edge</b> gradient magnitude profile and the value <b>of</b> the <b>edge</b> gradient magnitude using a weighted average. The standard deviation describes the <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>edge,</b> and its edge gradient magnitude is also included to make the blur measure more reliable.

40|$|Recent {{theoretical}} and observational {{studies have shown}} that ashes from thermonuclear burning may be ejected during radius-expansion bursts, giving rise to photoionisation edges in the X-ray spectra. We report a search for such features in Chandra spectra observed from the low-mass X-ray binary 4 U 1728 - 34. We analysed the spectra from four radius-expansion bursts detected in 2006 July, and two in 2002 March, but found no evidence for discrete features. We estimate upper limits for the equivalent <b>widths</b> <b>of</b> <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> a few hundred eV, which for the moderate temperatures observed during the bursts, are comparable with the predictions. During the 2006 July observation 4 U 1728 - 34 exhibited weak, unusually frequent bursts (separated by < 2 hr in some cases), with profiles and alpha-values characteristic of hydrogen-poor fuel. Recurrence times as short as those measured are insufficient to exhaust the accreted hydrogen at solar composition, suggesting that the source accretes hydrogen deficient fuel, for example from an evolved donor. The detection for the first time of a 10. 77 min periodic signal in the persistent intensity, perhaps arising from orbital modulation, supports this explanation, and suggests that this system is an ultracompact binary similar to 4 U 1820 - 30.

40|$|Sharpening is a {{powerful}} image transformation because sharp edges can bring out image details. Sharpness is achieved by increasing local contrast and reducing edge widths. We present a method that enhances sharpness of images and thereby their perceptual quality. Most existing enhancement techniques require user input to improve {{the perception of the}} scene in a manner most pleasing to the particular user. Our goal of image enhancement is to improve the perception of sharpness in digital images for human viewers. We consider two parameters in order to exaggerate the differences between local intensities. The two parameters exploit local contrast and <b>widths</b> <b>of</b> <b>edges.</b> We start from the assumption that color, texture, or objects of focus such as faces affect the human perception of photographs. When human raters are presented with a collection of images with different sharpness and asked to rank them according to perceived sharpness, the results have shown that there is a statistical consensus among the raters. We introduce a ramp enhancement technique by modifying the optimal overshoot in the ramp for different region contrasts as well as the new ramp width. Optimal parameter values are searched to be applied to regions under the criteria mentioned above. In this way, we aim to enhance digital images automatically to create pleasing image output for common users...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an efficient approach to measure sharpness mismatches between stereoscopic views. Sharpness mismatch can occur through focus mismatches between stereoscopic cameras, errors in post-processing {{or even for}} low-bandwidth transmission, where one view is subsampled or transmitted {{at a much lower}} rate. This artifact can lead to a degraded 3 D experience for observers. In this paper, the sharpness mismatch score is estimated by measuring the <b>width</b> deviations <b>of</b> <b>edge</b> pairs in each valid depth plane. The mismatch probability is then calculated considering the perceptibility <b>of</b> <b>edge</b> <b>width</b> deviations. In the experiments, Gaussian low-pass filters were used to generate global sharpness mismatches between stereoscopic views since defocus-based effects of lens aberrations can be modeled as Gaussian blur. Thus, the global sharpness distortions simulate the focus mismatch of stereo cameras. The disparity maps of test videos were automatically generated and corrected. In addition, original high-quality disparity maps of the test datasets were used as benchmarks. According to the experimental results, we show that the proposed approach performs well on measuring sharpness mismatch between stereoscopic views by comparison with some state-of-the-art metrics...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the terahertz (THz) response of a square antidot superlattice {{by means of}} photoconductivity measurements using a Fourier-transform-spectrometer. We detect, spectrally resolved, the cyclotron resonance and the fundamental magnetoplasmon mode of the periodic superlattice. In the dissipative transport regime both resonances are observed in the photoresponse. In the adiabatic transport regime, at integer filling factor ν= 2, only the cyclotron resonance is observed. From this we infer that different mechanisms contribute to converting the absorption of THz radiation into photoconductivity in the cyclotron and in the magnetoplasmon resonances. In the dissipative transport regime, heating of the electrons via resonant absorption of the THz radiation in the two-dimensional bulk is the main mechanism of photoconductivity in both resonances. In {{the case of the}} cyclotron resonance, and especially in the adiabatic transport regime, we find an additional contribution to photoconductivity which we interpret as being caused by THz-absorption-induced backscattering <b>of</b> <b>edge</b> states. The characteristic decay length of the magnetoplasmon at the sample edges is about an order of magnitude larger than the typical <b>width</b> <b>of</b> the <b>edge</b> states in the quantum Hall effect.
