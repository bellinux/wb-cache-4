40|$|In this <b>work,</b> <b>distortions</b> {{produced}} in the unit cell of a MBANP [(-) - 2 -(alpha-methylbenzylamino) - 5 -nitropyridine] nonlinear organic crystal {{under the influence of}} an applied electric field, (E) over bar, are investigated by using synchrotron-radiation x-ray multiple diffraction (XRMD). The method is based in the inherent sensitivity of this technique to determine small changes in the crystal lattice, which provide peak position changes in the XRMD pattern (Renninger scan). A typical Renninger scan shows numerous secondary peaks, each one carrying information on one particular direction within the crystal. The (hkl) peak position in the pattern, for a fixed wavelength, is basically a function of the unit cell lattice parameters. Thus small changes in any parameter due to a strain produced by (E) over right arrow give rise to a corresponding variation in the (hkl) peak position and the observed strain is related to the piezoelectric coefficients. The advantage of this method is the possibility of determining more than one piezoelectric coefficient from a single Renninger scan measurement [L. H. Avanci, L. P. Cardoso, S. E. Girdwood, D. Pugh, J. N. Sherwood, and K. J. Roberts, Phys. Rev. Lett. 81, 5426 (1998) ].

40|$|Abstract: We {{present results}} of first-principles {{calculations}} of structural, magnetic, and electronic properties of small Fe clusters.

At the same time, the magnetic moments of the clusters are enhanced with respect to the pure GGA case, resulting in maximal moments (in the sense of Hund’s rules) of 4 µB per atom for the ground state structures of Fe 3 and Fe 4, and a total moment of 18 µB for Fe 5. This already happens for moderate values of the Coulomb repulsion parameter U ∼ 2. 0 eV and is explained by changes in the electronic structures of the clusters...|$|R

40|$|Segregation {{distortion}} is {{a phenomenon}} that has been observed in many experimental systems. How segregation distortion among markers arises {{and its impact on}} mapping studies are the focus of this <b>work.</b> Segregation <b>distortion</b> of markers can be considered to arise from segregation distortion loci (SDL). I develop a theory of segregation distortion and show that the presence of only a few SDL can cause the entire chromosome to distort from Mendelian segregation. Segregation distortion is detrimental to the power of detecting quantitative trait loci (QTL) with dominance effects, but it is not always a detriment to QTL mapping for additive effects. When segregation distortion of a locus is a random event, the SDL is beneficial to QTL mapping ∼ 44 % of the time. If SDL are present and ignored, power loss can be substantial. A dense marker map can be used to ameliorate the situation, and if dense marker information is incorporated, power loss is minimal. However, other situations are less benign. A method that can simultaneously map QTL and SDL is discussed, maximizing both use of mapping resources and use by agricultural and evolutionary biologists...|$|R
