40|$|A novel reductase {{displaying}} high specificity for glyoxylate and NADPH was purified 3343 -fold from spinach leaves. The enzyme {{was found}} to be an oligomer of about 125 kDa, composed of four equal subunits of 33 kDa each. A Km for glyoxylate was about 14 -fold lower with NADPH than with NADH (0. 085 and 1. 10 mM respectively), but the maximal activity, 210 mumol/min per mg of protein, was similar with either cofactor. Km values for NADPH and NADH were 3 and 150 microM respectively. Optimal rates with either NADPH or NADH were found in the pH range 6. 5 - 7. 4. The enzyme also showed some reactivity towards hydroxypyruvate with rates less than 2 % of those observed for glyoxylate. Results of immunological studies, using antibodies prepared against either glyoxylate reductase or spinach peroxisomal hydroxypyruvate reductase, suggested substantial differences in molecular structure of the two proteins. The high rates of NADPH(NADH) -glyoxylate reductase in crude leaf extracts of spinach, <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> bean (30 - 45 mumol/h per mg of chlorophyll) and its strong affinity for glyoxylate suggest that the enzyme may be an important side component of photorespiration in vivo.

40|$|Selective {{breeding}} and improved nutritional management {{over the past}} 20 – 30 years has resulted in dramatic improvements in growth efficiency for pigs and poultry, particularly lean tissue growth. However, this has been achieved using high-quality feed ingredients, such as <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> that are also used for human consumption and more recently biofuels production. Ruminants {{on the other hand}} are less efficient, but are normally fed poorer quality ingredients that cannot be digested by human subjects, such as grass or silage. The challenges therefore are to: (i) maintain the current efficiency of growth of pigs and poultry, but using more ingredients not needed to feed the increasing human population or for the production of biofuels; (ii) improve the efficiency of growth in ruminants; (iii) at the same time produce animal products (meat, milk and eggs) of equal or improved quality.

Preclinical studies have been conducted to found out the effect of GMO peas on animals - rats of outbreeding line Wistar. In a total, 24 male, specific pathogen free Wistar rats were used in the experiment. At the beginning of the experiment, the animals were 28 days old. The three experimental groups with 8 individuals were created. The first group of rats was fed with GMO peas, the second group of rats consumed mix of pea cultivar Raman and the third group was control without pea addition (<b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> were used instead of pea). In the present study we focused our attention on health, growth and utility features of rats fed with GM pea. All characteristic were observed during the experiment lasting 35 days. Consumed feed was weighted daily and the weight of the animals was measured every seven days. The average values were compared within the groups. The aim of the experiment was to verify if resistant lines of pea influence the weight growth of animal models.

40|$|The {{topic is}} {{intentionally}} controversial. Prices {{on a number}} of food types used for biofuel have doubled in last couple of years. In the same time oil price is soaring. Many factors are contributing to the rise of food prices: the biggest is escalating demand. In recent years the economies of the world developing countries have been growing about 7 percent a year; other factors are droughts, new deregulation in agricultural policies (less intervention lowering stock levels), US dollar weakness benefiting commodity prices as safe haven asset and increase production costs like energy inputs. The explanation of the increases of oils prices are very close: the growth of new developing countries, political instability in fuel exporting countries, the loss of faith in US currency, the low investments in prospecting and refining of fuel. The use of renewable biofuels in lieu of fuel to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase energy security. Brazil produces 5 billions gal (19 millions hL) of sugarcane ethanol, enough to supply 45 % of its transportation fuel demands. This production needs 6 millions hectares on a total of 400 millions ha for farming. In EU the proportion area devoted to biofuels is 1 %. In US, at the same time substantial price rises for maize, the main raw material for the US ethanol. The expected reduction in US maize exports would weigh heavily on the already tight supply on international grain market. In any event, even if maize yields were to achieve the require increase, the United States might have to limit exports in order to achieve its ambitious biofuels targets. The competition between food uses and biofuels is depending of the speed of development of second generation cellulosic and biomass based biofuels and of the purpose of US authorities to improve the level of grains stocks as corn, <b>wheat</b> <b>and</b> <b>soya...</b>|$|R

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to obtain more knowledge {{about the use of}} feeding protein diet separately and protein-free diet to estimate the biological value of proteins. Proteins were given in three experiments for one hour daily and free access to protein-free diet for the following 23 -hour. In Expt. 1, casein <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> gluten were eaten daily in an amount of 192 mg nitrogen (N) per male rat for 12 weeks after a training period. In Expt. 2, these two proteins in addition to potato protein <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> protein were given daily in an amount of 192 mg N per male rat for 16 weeks after a training period. In Expt. 3, casein <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> gluten were given to appetite for three replicates of weanling male or female rats for 20 weeks. Liveweight, feed intake and carcass analysis of water, fat and N were recorded in the three experiments. Levels of free amino acids in blood (FAA) before and after the protein meal were estimated at different intervals in Expt. 2, and fasting levels (before giving the protein) of the same rats at different ages were determined in Expt. 3. Furthermore, FAA of some newborn rats and their mothers (Trial 3) on the day of birth were estimated. As judged from the effect of the protein types on different parameters, casein and the third potato protein ranked alike in their nutritive value. They were superior in their nutritive value to <b>wheat</b> gluten <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> protein (heated). The wheat gluten was inferior in nutritive value to the soya protein in a relatively short experimental period, but similar in a relatively long experimental period. On an equal amount of N, rats on inferior proteins increased in weight more slowly than rats on superior proteins. Prolongation of the experiment with restricted protein resulted in a similar total gain in weight, when the difference in the protein quality was not too large (<b>wheat</b> gluten <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> protein). Furthermore, rats on proteins with large difference in quality also gained similar total liveweight, when the proteins (casein <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> gluten) were offered to appetite for a relatively long experiment (Expt. 3). The ratio of energy to protein was higher on giving superior protein to appetite or in restricted amount than on inferior protein. When the protein was to appetite, rats seemed to adapt themselves to the deficiency of amino acids (AA) in wheat gluten as judged from the similar liveweight of the casein and wheatgluten group of the same sex in Expt. 3 by increasing the protein intake. On restricted protein, the percentage and quantities of the component of the rats' bodies determined did not differ significantly between casein and potato groups and between wheat-gluten <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> group, whereas there were significant differences between the casein or potato group <b>and</b> wheat-gluten or <b>soya</b> group. These significant differences indicate that superior protein can increase rapidly not only quantities of body components but also some of their proportions. The ratio of N to water and N % are slightly, though significantly, affected by the quality of protein in a restricted amount over a relatively long period (Expt. 1 and 2). However this ratio and percentage varied generally in relatively narrow limits in the three experiments. Although {{there were no significant differences}} between the weights of the casein and wheat-gluten group of the same sex at the end of Expt. 3, significant differences between their body constituents were found in some cases but not between the amount or percentage N. In general, age influence was confirmed to be a decrease in water percentage and ail increase in nitrogen percentage, in fat percentage and in the quantities of the body components. In most instances, higher levels of FAA were recorded after eating proteins than during fasting on the protein-free diet. Generally, the percentage increases in tyrosine or the branched amino acids (isoleucine, leucine and valine) were highest of FAA, whereas those of glycine and glutamic acid were lowest. Detection of limiting amino acid(s) in the protein - casein, potato protein, <b>wheat</b> gluten <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> protein - from the levels of FAA before and after eating proteins was not completely successful. Free arginine and histidine levels decreased to a great extent in some instances after eating casein, potato protein, <b>wheat</b> gluten <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> protein in spite of being probably, not the most limiting AA in these four proteins. This probably indicates metabolism interrelations. Care must be taken, therefore, in the interpretation of levels of FAA as an index for limiting AA, i. e., they may not reflect the exact limiting order of the dietary AA. Nevertheless, the data show that wheat gluten is deficient in lysine <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> protein is more deficient than potato protein in methionine. Markedly, fasting levels of free threonine and glutamic acid in blood of potato group and taurine in blood of wheat-gluten group were the highest values of the four groups on feeding 192 N in Expt. 2. Moreover, levels of free threonine, lysine and glutamic acid in blood of wheat-gluten group before and after feeding on the proteins were the lowest values. When fed on casein <b>and</b> <b>wheat</b> gluten to appetite (Expt. 3), free lysine and threonine were mostly lower in blood of males and females of wheat-gluten group than of casein group. Although there were sometimes rough relationships between the levels of FAA and AA contents in dietary proteins, rats modify the ratio between essential AA of dietary proteins to maintain almost constant ratio between essential FAA. Generally, variations in the levels of essential FAA due to feeding, ages, individuals or amount of protein were reduced on expressing them in percentages of the total essential amino acids. At 12 weeks of age in Expt. 3, free lysine levels in blood of wheat-gluten group were markedly higher in females than in males. At 24 weeks of age, levels of free threonine in blood of wheat-gluten group were also markedly higher in females than in males. This suggests that females adapt themselves better for the deficiency of lysine and threonine in wheat-gluten diet than males. With age, most FAA, though not the same, increased from birth to weaning at about 4 weeks old, from beginning to Week 8 of Expt. 3 (4 - 12 weeks old) as shown in males and females of casein and wheat-gluten group at 12 weeks of age, then decreased from Week 8 to 20 of Expt. 3 (12 - 24 weeks old) except for females of casein group at 24 weeks of age. Furthermore, most FAA of male rats also decreased in many cases in Expt. 2 with age from 10 - 21 weeks, in spite of the difference in the amount and type of the protein in Expt. 2 and Expt. 3. It is noteworthy that a markedly reversed trend (decrease) was found in level of free histidine from birth to weaning. Furthermore, levels of free lysine in blood of rats on deficient diet in lysine increased with age, whereas most free essential FAA decreased. Generally, intake of wheat gluten compared to casein tended to reduce the average levels of most individual FAA, when restricted or fed to appetite. Most fasting levels of FAA of wheat-gluten group were lower on restricted amount of gluten (Expt. 2) than on free access to the protein (Expt. 3). Most essential FAA of newborn rats were higher than their mothers. Furthermore, rats post partum had a lower level of FAA than virgin rats. Data of the experiments show that alteration in levels of FAA is affected by the interaction of protein type, age and sex in addition to other factors such as pregnancy and metabolic interrelationships...|$|R

The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions from the steppes for Awassi sheep keeping and feed cropping in arid zones such as Syria. The methodology developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was used to estimate N 2 O emissions. A survey was conducted on 64 farms in Syria to gather data for analysis. Precipitation and crop yield data from 2001 to 2009 were also used for calculation and modelling. Sheep-keeping systems, precipitation, year and the region have significant effects on N 2 O emissions (p< 0. 05). Emissions of N 2 O from lands with extensive, semi-intensive and intensive systems were 0. 30 ± 0. 093, 0. 598 ± 0. 113 and 2. 243 ± 0. 187 kgsheep− 1 year− 1, respectively.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{experimental}} activity was the analysis of <b>wheat,</b> corn <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> bean yields as affected by three techniques of soil tillage;in the meanwhile, crop residues management and grains contamination by fungi. The site test was located in Polesine, at Sasse-Rami farm (property of Veneto Agricoltura) in Ceregnano (Rovigo) on silt-clay textured fields. The trials were carried out according to three tillage techniques commolnly used by farmers: 1) conventional tillage system with plowing depth 35 cm, with total mixing of crop residues and subsequent secondary tillage to prepare the seedbed 2) minimum tillage, by decompaction of soil without layer inversion and with partial mixing of crop residues with the soil 3) direct seeding with deposition of seed without any tillage and with total conservation of crop residues on the soil surface. The evaluation of the three techniques was performed by monitoring soil conditions and their evolution over time, using the cone penetration test, which allows to estimate soil compaction from which root asphyxia or vernal pool may arise. It was also monitored the evolution of organic matter and its humus fractions, {{in order to identify}} possible variations, and to collect yield data related to the different crops over the years test.

40|$|The {{increase}} in agricultural commodity {{prices in the}} recent past has renewed interest in ascertaining the factors that drive agricultural commodity prices. Though a number of factors are possible, higher oil prices are thought to be the major factor driving up agricultural commodity prices, especially as the demand for biofuels production increases. However, empirical evidence of this relationship remain ambiguous and largely depends on the method used. For this reason, {{there is a need to}} examine the relationship in the context of different methodologies. Furthermore, information on how South African commodity prices respond to world oil price shocks is less certain. A good understanding of the factors that drive local commodity prices will assist in making sound agricultural policies. In this paper, the Granger causality test is applied to the mean to investigate the causality between oil prices <b>and</b> agricultural (<b>soya</b> beans, <b>wheat,</b> sunflower <b>and</b> corn) commodity prices in South Africa. Daily data spanning from 19 April 2005 to 31 July 2014 is used for Brent crude oil, corn, <b>wheat,</b> sunflower <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> beans prices. Agricultural commodity prices were obtained from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, and the series of Brent crude oil prices from the U. S. Department of Energy. Results from the linear causality test indicate that oil prices do not influence agricultural commodity prices. However, owing to structural breaks and nonlinear dependence between the variables of study, these results are misleading. As an alternative, the nonparametric test of Granger causality in quantiles, as proposed by Jeong, Härdle and Song (2012) is used. Through this test, we not only look at causality beyond the mean estimates but also accounts for the structural breaks and nonlinear dependence present in the data. Additionally, the method becomes more instructive in the case where the distribution of variables has fat tails. The findings show that the effect of changes in oil prices on agricultural commodity prices vary across the different quantiles of the conditional distribution. The highest impact is not at the median, and the impact on the tails is lower compared to the rest of the distribution. The analysis shows that the relationship between oil prices and agricultural commodity prices depends on specific phases of the market, and therefore contradicts the neutrality hypothesis that oil prices do not cause agricultural commodity prices in South Africa. This implies that policies to stabilize domestic agricultural commodity prices must consider developments in the world oil markets. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRadiation {{exchange}} at {{the surface}} plays {{a critical role in}} the surface energy balance, plant microclimate, and plant growth. The ability to simulate the surface energy balance and the microclimate within the plant canopy is contingent upon simulation of the surface radiation exchange. A validation and modification exercise of the Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model was conducted for simulating the surface short-wave and long-wave radiation exchange over <b>and</b> within <b>wheat,</b> maize <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> bean plant canopies using data collected at Yucheng in the North China Plain and near Ames, Iowa. Whereas model testing was limited to monocultures and mixed canopies of green and senesced leaves, methodologies were developed for simulating short-wave and long-wave radiation fluxes applicable to a multi-species, multi-layer plant canopy. Although the original SHAW model slightly underpredicted reflected solar radiation with a mean bias error (MBE) of − 5 to − 10 Wm− 2, one would conclude that the simulations were quite reasonable if within-canopy measurements were not available. However, within-canopy short-wave radiation was considerably underestimated (MBE of approximately − 20 Wm− 2) by the original SHAW model. Additionally, leaf temperatures tended to be overpredicted (MBE=+ 0. 76 °C) {{near the top of the}} canopy and underpredicted near the bottom (MBE=− 1. 12 °C). Modification to the SHAW model reduced MBE of above canopy reflected radiation to − 1 to − 6 Wm− 2 and within-canopy radiation simulations to approximately − 6 Wm− 2; bias in leaf temperature was reduced to less than 0. 4 °C. Model modifications resulted in essentially no change in simulated evapotranspiration for wheat, 4. 5 % lower for maize and 1 % higher for soya bean. Alternative approaches for simulating canopy transmissivity to diffuse radiation were tested in the modified version and had a minor influence on simulated short-wave radiation, but made almost no difference in simulated long-wave radiation or evapotranspiration. Modifications to the model should lead to more accurate plant microclimate simulation; further work is needed to evaluate their influence...|$|R
40|$|The {{interest}} for biodegradation technologies of vegetation waste is increasingly significant, {{as well for}} an environmental point of view than a public health point of view. The two most important biotechnologies for vegetable degradation, based on biological events, are the biomethanogenesis and composting. The biotechnology developed in this study, {{is based on the}} efficiency of the rumen to degrade vegetables. Indeed, ruminants are the most efficient animals to degrade vegetable wastes thanks to a microbial community very abundant and very effective. Among these micro-organisms, Fibrobacter succinogenes is the major species. It has an enzymatic equipment very complete and complex which explain these capacities to degrade the vegetables. These potentialities can thus be used {{within the framework of the}} development of a technology of biodegradation of vegetation wastes and within the framework of the MELiSSA project which aims to create an artificial closed ecosystem. This study focused on the development of an anaerobic bioreactor for Fibrobacter succinogenes S 85 cultures. First, cultures on glucose were carried out in order to validate the techniques used. These cultures showed that our process is valid for Fibrobacter succinogenes cultures. They also showed a link between VFA production, glucose consumption and gas pressure measurement. So the pressure could be used as a growth parameter especially when growth occurs on vegetables. The degradation of the vegetation wastes by Fibrobacter succinogenes was then performed. The substrate was composed of cabbage, <b>wheat</b> straw <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> bean, in <b>mixture</b> (1 / 3 of each) or separately. These cultures showed different kinetics of degradation according to the substrate used. The explanation is that the difference in composition of the substrate (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) causes, for the substrate richest in fibres, the synthesis of more specific enzymes. Then, the degradation of a substrate from a first degradation by methanogenesis, within the framework of MAP project, was carried out. These cultures allowed an improvement of the system and revealed important total degradation yields (MAP loop). The presence of a contaminant was verified by molecular biology in order to explain the production of butyrate in our cultures. With these experiments we can't conclude of the presence of a contaminant and other research must be performed. Finally, all performed fermentations were simulated with the program "Anaerobic Waste Compartment Modelling and Simulation". These simulations show a very great similarity with the experimental results. So this program can be used to predict the degradation of a biggest quantity of substrate. Les potentialités Fibrobacter succinogenes, l'espèce majeure du rumen, ont été utilisées pour la dégradation de végétaux et dans le cadre du projet MELiSSa créé par l'ESA. Dans un premier temps des cultures sur glucose nous ont permis de maîtriser notre procédé et de valider les techniques utilisées.

The purpose was to determine which of the two methods was the most effective to accurately map and estimate crop residues. It is worth while mentioning that this the first time hyperspectral data were used to mapping ends of crop residue, which constitutes an advancement in the domain. To complete the dataset, several spectral reflectance measures were taken from different types of crop residues (corn, <b>wheat,</b> herb, <b>soya</b> <b>and</b> sunflower) and different types of bare soils, obtained by the spectroradiometer GER 3700. Nine crop residue indices were used (BI, CAI, NDI- 1, NDI- 2, SACRI- 1, SACRI- 2, MSACRI- 1, MSACRI- 2 and CRIM). (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

The ability to simulate the surface energy balance and the microclimate within the plant canopy is contingent upon simulation of the surface radiation exchange. A validation and modification exercise of the Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model was conducted for simulating the sui face short-wave and long-wave radiation exchange over <b>and</b> within <b>wheat,</b> maize <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> bean plant canopies using data collected at Yucheng in the North China Plain and neat Ames. Iowa Whereas model testing was limited to monocultures and mixed canopies of green and senesced leaves, methodologies were developed for simulating short-wave and long-wave radiation fluxes applicable to a multi-species, multi-layer plant canopy Although the original SHAW model slightly under predicted reflected solar radiation with a mean bias en or (MBE) of - 5 to - 10 W m(- 2), one would conclude that the simulations were quite reasonable if within-canopy measurements were not available However, within-canopy short-wave radiation was considerably under estimated (MBE of approximately - 20 W m(- 2)) by the original SHAW model Additionally, leaf temperatures tended to be overpredicted (MBE = + 0 76 degrees C) {{near the top of the}} canopy and underpredicted near the bottom (MBE = - 1 12 degrees C) Modification to the SHAW model reduced MBE of above canopy reflected radiation to - 1 to - 6 W m(- 2) and within-canopy radiation simulations to approximately - 6 W m(- 2). bias in leaf temperature was reduced to less than 0 4 degrees C Model modifications resulted in essentially no change in simulated evapotranspiration lot wheat. 4. 5 % lower for maize and 1 % higher for soya bean Alternative approaches for simulating canopy transmissivity to diffuse radiation were tested in the modified version and had a minor influence on simulated short-wave radiation, but made almost no difference in simulated long-wave radiation or evapotranspiration Modifications to the model should lead to more accurate plant microclimate simulation, further work is needed to evaluate their influence (C) 2009 Royal Netherlands Society for Agricultural Sciences Published by Elsevier B V All rights reserve...|$|R

40|$|The worst {{food crisis}} since 1974 {{broke out in}} 2007 - 08. Higher world market prices of food {{commodities}} (especially <b>wheat,</b> rice, <b>soya</b> <b>and</b> maize) sparked an unprecedented {{increase in the number}} of hungry people. Despite moderately lower prices since the summer of 2008, the number of the hungry continued to rise in 2009. This food crisis has placed the fight against hunger on the international agenda. Since March 2008 governments UN agencies and many social movements have adopted positions on the causes of the crisis and the means to address it. Unfortunately, while these parties are trying to coordinate their activities and suggest new approaches, the old recipes for producing more food are often brought up. Contradictory proposals are made and the thought given to the causes underlying hunger and the food crisis (social, economic and political discrimination and exclusion) has gone largely unheeded. The first Millennium Development Goal, which calls for cutting the percentage of hungry people by half by 2015, is clearly out of reach. But the food crisis might lead to a new world food order based on the three pillars of food assistance, food security and the right to food...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{ability of}} bacteriocin-like {{inhibitory}} substance (BLIS) -producing {{lactic acid bacteria}} (LAB) to degrade biogenic amines {{as well as to}} produce L(+) and D(−) -lactic acid during solid state fermentation (SSF) of lupin <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> bean was investigated. In addition, the protein digestibility and formation of organic acids during SSF of legume were investigated. RESULTS: Protein digestibility of fermented lupin <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> beanwas found higher on average by 18. 3 % and 15. 9 %, respectively, compared to untreated samples. Tested LAB produced mainly L-lactic acid in <b>soya</b> bean <b>and</b> lupin (D/L ratio 0. 38 – 0. 42 and 0. 35 – 0. 54, respectively), while spontaneous fermentation gave almost equal amounts of both lactic acid isomers (D/L ratio 0. 82 – 0. 98 and 0. 92, respectively). Tested LAB strains were able to degrade phenylethylamine, spermine and spermidine, whereas they were able to produce putrescine, histamine and tyramine. CONCLUSIONS: SSF improved lupin <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> bean protein digestibility. BLIS-producing LAB in lupin <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> bean medium producedamixture of D-andL-lactic acidwith a major excess of the latter isomer.

40|$|Lupin <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> {{are members}} of the Leguminosae family which are {{recognised}} as some of the richest source of vegetable proteins. Lupin- and soya-containing products are available on the EU market and could cause severe adverse reactions in allergic individuals, even if consumed at low concentrations. In this context the development of methods for reliable detection of these allergens in food products is a useful tool for the surveillance of established legislation on food labelling within the EU. This work described the development of a duplex real-time PCR method allowing the simultaneous detection of traces of lupin <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> in processed food based on a specific TaqMan probe designed on a mitochondrial tRNA-MET gene. A set of primers and probes was designed for the amplification of a 168 and 175 bp fragment of lupin <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> mitochondrial DNA, respectively. The performance of the method was established using lupin <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> flours <b>and</b> cookies baked from lupin- and soya-containing dough (different concentrations and baking times). The PCR platform yielded consistent and repeatable results. The specificity of the system was tested with DNA from 28 plant species. The sensitivity of the method was suitable to detect allergenic ingredients in the low mg per kg range. Both lupin <b>and</b> <b>soya</b> at a level of 2. 5 mg per kg food matrix could be detected in cookies baked at 180 C for 10 min. The method was successfully applied to bakery (e. g. bread) and vegetarian (e. g. non-meat sausages) food products that contain or may contain soya and/or lupin as ingredient or contaminant (according to the declaration on the product label).
