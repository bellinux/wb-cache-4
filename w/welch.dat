5|$|Five Dodgers first-round picks {{have won}} a World Series {{championship}}s with the team. Pitchers Bob <b>Welch</b> (1977) and Steve Howe (1979) played with the 1981 championship team. Shortstop Dave Anderson (1981) and first baseman Franklin Stubbs (1982) {{were a part of}} the 1988 championship team. Catcher Mike Scioscia (1976) won championships with both teams. <b>Welch</b> was also on the Oakland Athletics' 1988 team which lost to the Dodgers in the 1988 Series.

50|$|It is not {{recommended}} to pre-test for equal variances and then choose between Student's t-test or <b>Welch's</b> t-test. Rather, <b>Welch's</b> t-test can be applied directly and without any substantial disadvantages to Student's t-test as noted above. <b>Welch's</b> t-test remains robust for skewed distributions and large sample sizes. Reliability decreases for skewed distributions and smaller samples, where one could possibly perform <b>Welch's</b> t-test on ranked data.|$|R

50|$|<b>Welch's</b> t-test is {{more robust}} than Student's t-test and {{maintains}} type I error rates close to nominal for unequal variances and for unequal sample sizes under normality. Furthermore, {{the power of}} <b>Welch's</b> t-test comes close to that of Student's t-test, even when the population variances are equal and sample sizes are balanced. <b>Welch's</b> t-test can be generalized to more than 2-samples, which is more robust than {{one-way analysis of variance}} (ANOVA).|$|R

50|$|Student's t-test {{assumes that}} the two populations have normal {{distributions}} and with equal variances. <b>Welch's</b> t-test is designed for unequal variances, but the assumption of normality is maintained. <b>Welch's</b> t-test is an approximate solution to the Behrens-Fisher problem.|$|R
40|$|Coverage for <b>Welch’s</b> {{technique}} {{was less than}} the confidence-level when size was inversely proportional to variance and skewness was extreme.

5|$|The {{alternative}} route via Horseway sluice and the Old Bedford River {{has been closed}} for several years.

50|$|After The Shadows' disbanded in 1990, with Marvin {{deciding}} to tour {{with his own}} band, <b>Welch's</b> plans for his own tours did not fully materialise until 1998, when he formed Bruce <b>Welch's</b> Shadows (originally called 'Bruce <b>Welch's</b> Moonlight Shadows' - a name that was dropped after 1998). The group featured former Shadows bassist Alan Jones and keyboardist Cliff Hall, with Bob Watkins on drums.
