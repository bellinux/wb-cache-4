50|$|Case study: 54-year-old {{woman with}} known history of {{epilepsy}} This patient {{was diagnosed with}} a pure form of dysgraphia of letters, meaning she had no other speech or reading impairments. Her impairment was specific to letters in the alphabet. She was able to copy letters from the alphabet, but she was not able to write these letters. She had previously been rated average on the <b>Wechsler</b> <b>Adult</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Scale's</b> vocabulary subtest for writing ability comparative to her age before her diagnosis. Her writing impairment consisted of difficulty remembering motor movements associated with the letters she was supposed to write. She was able to copy the letters, and also form images that were similar to the letters. This suggests that dysgraphia for letters is a deficit related to motor memory. Somehow there is a specific portion of the brain related to writing letters, which is dissociated from copying and drawing letter-like items.|$|R

These tests are typically standardized, meaning that they have been administered to a specific group (or groups) of individuals before being used in individual clinical cases. The data resulting from standardization are known as normative data. After these data have been collected and analyzed, they are used as the comparative standard against which individual performances can be compared. Examples of neuropsychological tests include: the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), the <b>Wechsler</b> <b>Adult</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Scale</b> (WAIS), Boston Naming Test, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, the Benton Visual Retention Test, and the Controlled Oral Word Association.

In performing this critical examination, international test adaptation guidelines and standards, psychometric conventions, and national and international research findings were contemplated. The general conclusion reached was that the equivalence of the WAIS-III across diverse language groups has not been unequivocally established and there are indications that some bias may exist for English second language test-takers, especially if they are black or Afrikaans-speaking.

40|$|Objective: Neurocognitive test {{batteries}} such {{as recent}} {{editions of the}} <b>Wechsler’s</b> <b>Adult</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Scale</b> (WAIS-III/WAIS-IV) typically use nation-level population-based norms. The question is whether these batteries function {{in the same manner}} across different subgroups based on gender, age, educational background, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, mother tongue, or race. Here, the author argues that measurement invariance is a core issue in determining whether population-based norms are valid for different subgroups. Method: The author introduces measurement invariance, argues why it is an important topic of study, discusses why invariance might fail in cognitive ability testing, and reviews a dozen studies of invariance of commonly used neurocognitive test batteries. Results: In over half of the reviewed studies, IQ batteries were not found to be measurement invariant across groups based on ethnicity, gender, educational background, cohort, or age. Apart from age and cohort, test manuals do not take such lack of invariance into account in computing full-scale IQ scores or normed domain scores. Conclusions: Measurement invariance is crucial for valid use of neurocognitive tests in clinical, educational, and professional practice. The appropriateness of population-based norms to particular subgroups should depend also on whether measurement invariance holds with respect to important subgroups.

The European Federation of Neurological Societies {{task force on}} neuropsychological tests produced this survey on neuropsychological tests currently being used in different European countries to gather knowledge on the practice of dementia centres and to promote the harmonization of such instruments and future multicentre collaborations. Methods: National representatives of 34 countries received a questionnaire and 25 (73. 5 %) sent it back. Results: A few instruments, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Trail Making Test (TMT), Verbal Fluency and Clock Drawing Test, were available in all countries. <b>Wechsler</b> <b>Adult</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Scales</b> and MMSE were reported to be valid, respectively, in 20 (80 %) and 19 (76 %) countries, whereas Verbal Fluency and Stroop Test are valid in 18 (72 %) of them.

40|$|Evidence of {{significant}} impairment in cognitive functioning {{has always been}} one of the main criteria of a learning disability (Pulsifer, 1996) and intellectual assessment is, therefore, one of the tasks of clinical psychologists working within learning disability services. Such assessments are commonly used to help establish of an individual’s cognitive strengths and weaknesses, support needs and more specifically, to help determine if an individual falls within the remit of learning disability services (McKenzie & Murray, 2002, Evers & Hill, 1999). Intellectual assessments also have important implications in terms of mental health legislation, accessing benefits and services and informing legal decision-making processes (British Psychological Society, 2001, McKay, 1991). It is, therefore, crucial that the assessments are valid, reliable and used only by appropriately trained and qualified professionals. In Britain, it is emphasised that assessing an individual’s intellectual functioning requires an individually administered, standardised psychometric assessment which is reliable and valid (British Psychological Society, 2001), while in America professional mandates, such as the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (AERA,APA & NCME, 1985) highlight the need for high standards of administrative accuracy from psychologists. The <b>Wechsler</b> <b>Adult</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>Scales</b> - Third Edition (Wechsler, 1998) are commonly used in intellectual and neuropsychological assessment and are considered to be valid, reliable and well-standardised (Groth-Marnat et al, 2000). The Wechsler Scales have a long history and have undergone a number of revisions with the most recent being in 1997 with the development of the <b>Wechsler</b> <b>Adult</b> <b>Intelligence</b> Scale-Third Edition (WAIS-III). The purpose of these revisions was to insure that the standardisation sample was representative of current demographics and performance, to update the subtests, incorporate new subtests, and refine the instructions and test materials.
