5|$|For a time, Duyệt's {{attitude}} and stature {{in the south}} forced Minh Mạng to moderate his policies and allow the preaching of Christian missionaries. However, it also increased {{the tension between the}} pair and Minh Mạng was anxious to curtail the autonomy that his father had granted to Duyệt and the southerners. The emperor began to slowly wind back their military powers, in an attempt to <b>wear</b> <b>down</b> Duyệt's power base by gradually removing the general's close aides.|$|E
5|$|Initial Vulcanian {{activity}} {{is characterized by}} a series of short-lived explosions, lasting a few minutes to a few hours and typified by the ejection of volcanic bombs and blocks. These eruptions <b>wear</b> <b>down</b> the lava dome holding the magma down, and it disintegrates, leading to much more quiet and continuous eruptions. Thus an early sign of future Vulcanian {{activity is}} lava dome growth, and its collapse generates an outpouring of pyroclastic material down the volcano's slope.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not clear}} which {{carnivores}} may have preyed on Massospondylus. Most of the theropods that have been discovered in rocks of Early Jurassic age in southern Africa, such as Coelophysis, were smaller than mid-sized sauropodomorphs like Massospondylus. These smaller predators have been postulated as using fast slashing attacks to <b>wear</b> <b>down</b> sauropodomorphs, which could have defended themselves with their large hand and foot claws. The 6-metre-(20ft-) long carnivorous theropod Dracovenator lived {{during the same period}} (Hettangian to Sinemurian stages) as Massospondylus and has also been found in the Elliot Formation of South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Koalas {{may live}} from 13 to 18 {{years in the}} wild. While female koalas usually live this long, males may die sooner because of their more {{hazardous}} lives. Koalas usually survive falls from trees and immediately climb back up, but injuries and deaths from falls do occur, particularly in inexperienced young and fighting males. Around six years of age, the koala's chewing teeth begin to <b>wear</b> <b>down</b> and their chewing efficiency decreases. Eventually, the cusps disappear completely and the animal will die of starvation.|$|E
5|$|Nebraska widened {{its lead}} with a 33-yard {{touchdown}} run six {{minutes into the}} second half, but Tech answered right back with a 33-yard touchdown pass on its subsequent possession. The score cut Nebraska's lead to 24–21. Unfortunately for the Hokies, that score was the closest they would get to a lead as Nebraska's offense began to <b>wear</b> <b>down</b> the Tech defense. Nebraska scored another touchdown {{in the fourth quarter}}, then racked up 10points in the fourth quarter to secure the victory. Nebraska won, 41–21.|$|E

5|$|Psittacosaurs had {{self-sharpening}} {{teeth that}} would have been useful for cropping and slicing tough plant material. Unlike later ceratopsians, they did not have teeth suitable for grinding or chewing their food. Instead, they used gastroliths—stones swallowed to <b>wear</b> <b>down</b> food as it passed through the digestive system. Sometimes numbering more than fifty, these stones are occasionally found in the abdominal cavities of psittacosaurs, and may have been stored in a gizzard, as in modern birds.|$|E
5|$|The Texas Tornado got {{an early}} {{advantage}} in his match with Mr. Perfect, controlling the bout with several power moves. Mr. Perfect recovered {{and used a}} neckbreaker and sleeper hold to <b>wear</b> <b>down</b> the Tornado. As Perfect was showing off for the crowd, the Tornado attacked him from behind. He wore Perfect down with a clawhold before hitting him with a discus punch to win the match and the Intercontinental Championship.|$|E
5|$|As Grant {{continued}} to <b>wear</b> <b>down</b> Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President Stephens led {{a group to}} meet with Lincoln, Seward, and others at Hampton Roads. Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results. On April 1, 1865, Grant successfully outflanked Lee's forces in the Battle of Five Forks and nearly encircled Petersburg, and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond. Days later, when that city fell, Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital; as {{he walked through the}} city, white Southerners were stone-faced, but freedmen greeted him as a hero. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox and the war was effectively over.|$|E

5|$|By this time, {{many of the}} 1970s repairs were {{beginning}} to <b>wear</b> <b>down,</b> and the city put aside its plans for the maritime museum. The New London Railroad Company, fronted by historian Barbara Timken and local businessman Todd O'Donnell, bought the station from the city as the New London Railroad Company in 2002. The pair organized a second full restoration of the station, including a new slate roof, restored brickwork, and restoration of the waiting room to its original configuration. The mezzanine level and basement atrium created in the 1976 renovation were removed. Additionally, mechanical systems were upgraded and various accessibility concerns addressed. The baggage room was restored for Greyhound use. Amtrak and Greyhound rent space from the company for offices and passenger waiting areas.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} of 22 August, a force of eight Fireflies and six bomb-armed Hellcats from Indefatigable raided Kaafjord again. This {{was the first in}} what was {{intended}} to be a series of small harassing attacks conducted to <b>wear</b> <b>down</b> the German defences. German forces did not detect the aircraft before they arrived over Kaafjord at 7:10 pm, and the Fireflies' strafing attacks on German gun positions killed one member of Tirpitzs crew and wounded ten. However, the Hellcats' bombs failed to inflict any damage on the battleship. The British fighters also attacked German ships and radar stations on their return flight, damaging two tankers, a supply ship and a patrol boat. No British aircraft were lost during this raid.|$|E
5|$|Following a new {{military}} {{strategy of the}} United States endorsed by Bill Clinton since February 1993, the Washington Agreement was signed by Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina in March 1994. The agreement ended the Croat–Bosniak War and established the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The political settlement allowed the ARBiH and the HVO to deploy additional troops against the VRS {{in a series of}} small-scale attacks designed to <b>wear</b> <b>down</b> the Bosnian Serb military, but the attacks claimed no territorial gains before October. The ARBiH adopted an attrition warfare strategy relying on its numerical superiority compared to the VRS, which suffered from manpower shortages. This strategy aimed for limited advances, without support of heavy weapons and means of transportunavailable to the ARBiH at the time.|$|E

5|$|Herodotus {{says that}} when the Persians in Asia Minor heard {{of the attack on}} Sardis, they {{gathered}} together, and marched to the relief of Artaphernes. When they arrived at Sardis, they found the Greeks recently departed. So they followed their tracks back towards Ephesus. They caught up with the Greeks outside Ephesus and the Greeks were forced to turn and prepare to fight. Holland suggests that the Persians were primarily cavalry (hence their ability {{to catch up with the}} Greeks). The typical Persian cavalry of the time were probably missile cavalry, whose tactics were to <b>wear</b> <b>down</b> a static enemy with volley after volley.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, the Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott) faced The Headshrinkers (Samu and Fatu). The {{advantage}} switched {{back and forth}} several times, as the Steiners threw The Headshrinkers with several suplex variations and used their aerial abilities to attack their opponents from the ring ropes. The Headshrinkers relied mainly on using their power to <b>wear</b> <b>down</b> the Steiners. At one point, Fatu picked Rick Steiner up on his shoulders so that Samu could attack Rick from the top rope. Rick caught Samu instead and performed a bodyslam on Samu from Fatu's shoulders. The match ended when Scott Steiner performed a Frankensteiner to pin Samu and win the match.|$|E
5|$|Operation Goodwood was {{a series}} of {{unsuccessful}} British carrier air raids conducted against the German battleship Tirpitz at her anchorage in Kaafjord, Norway, during late August 1944. It formed the last of several major attacks made by the Home Fleet during 1944 which sought to eliminate the potential threat Tirpitz posed to Allied shipping by badly damaging or sinking the warship. While each of the previous raids on Kaafjord conducted by Fleet Air Arm aircraft had involved only a single air strike, Operation Goodwood involved repeated attacks over a week. The Royal Navy hoped that these raids would <b>wear</b> <b>down</b> the formidable German defences.|$|E

5|$|The laurels for the day’s action {{went to the}} defenders. The aim of the Luftwaffe was to <b>wear</b> <b>down</b> the Fighter Command without {{suffering}} excessive losses in the process, and in this it had failed. It cost the attackers five aircrew killed, wounded, or taken prisoner, for each British pilot casualty. In terms of aircraft, it had cost the Luftwaffe five bombers and fighters for every three Spitfires and Hurricanes destroyed in the air or on the ground. If the battle continued at this rate the Luftwaffe would wreck Fighter Command, but it would come close to wrecking itself in the process.|$|E
5|$|Tuataras superficially {{resemble}} lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) {{on either}} side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually <b>wear</b> <b>down.</b> The brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles, and the lungs have a single chamber and lack bronchi. The tuatara has a well-developed parietal eye on its forehead.|$|E
