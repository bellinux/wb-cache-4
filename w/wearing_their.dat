5|$|Breaking with tradition, the Fighting Irish {{announced}} in June {{that they would}} be <b>wearing</b> <b>their</b> alternative green jerseys instead of blue against USC; Weis noted that it was in honor of the 1977Irish team that switched to green jerseys before defeating the Trojans en route to a national championship (Weis was a student at Notre Dame at the time). Previously, the Irish did not let the public know when they would be <b>wearing</b> <b>their</b> green jerseys.|$|E
5|$|Fourth Degree Knights may {{optionally}} {{purchase and}} wear the full regalia and join an assembly's Color Corps. The Color Corps {{is the most}} visible arm of the Knights, as they are often seen in parades and other local events <b>wearing</b> <b>their</b> colorful regalia. Official dress for the Color Corps is a black tuxedo, baldric, white gloves, cape, and naval chapeau. In warm climates and during warm months, a white dinner jacket may be worn, if done as a unit.|$|E
5|$|Plot {{elements}} for the episode {{date back to}} the original pitch to The Walt Disney Company for the series produced by Povenmire and Marsh. The pitch was constructed of storyboard reels which were recorded and dubbed over by Povenmire for voices, narration, and sound effects. The initial theme song featured an illustration of Phineas and Ferb, <b>wearing</b> <b>their</b> archeologist hats, discovering Candace, dressed in raggy toilet paper.|$|E

5|$|Pundits {{and opponents}} have {{asserted}} that Boise State benefits from an added advantage by <b>wearing</b> <b>their</b> blue home uniforms {{to match the}} playing field. Boise State possessed a 64–2 record at Bronco Stadium from 1998 to 2008. Nevada, designated as the home team, likewise wore blue uniforms during the Humanitarian Bowl.|$|E
5|$|The Bates {{method has}} been criticized not only {{because there is no}} good {{evidence}} it works, but also because it can have negative consequences for those who attempt to follow it: they might damage their eyes through overexposure of their eyes to sunlight, put themselves and others at risk by not <b>wearing</b> <b>their</b> corrective lenses while driving, or neglect conventional eye care, possibly allowing serious conditions to develop.|$|E
5|$|The fastidious little mouse {{spends a}} {{fortnight}} spring cleaning. She rubs the furniture with beeswax and polishes her little tin spoons, then holds {{a party for}} five other little wood-mice <b>wearing</b> <b>their</b> Regency finery. Mr. Jackson attends but is forced to sit outside because Mrs. Tittlemouse has narrowed her door. He takes no offence at being excluded from the parlour. Acorn-cupfuls of honeydew are passed through the window {{to him and he}} toasts Mrs. Tittlemouse's good health.|$|E

5|$|A {{few hours}} later, the Zimbabwean players {{returned}} to the field <b>wearing</b> <b>their</b> blue skirts and blue Zimbabwe Olympic blazers for the medals ceremony. After the third-placed Soviets and second-placed Czechoslovakians had received their medals, Grant led the team up to the podium to receive the first ever Olympic gold medal for women's hockey. It was their country's first Olympic medal of any colour. All 16 players received medals; they then led the Czechoslovakian and Soviet teams on a walking lap of honour around the field.|$|E
5|$|As a top-flight side, Manchester City {{entered the}} FA Cup {{in the third}} round, and were drawn at home to Reading of the Third Division. With City unusually <b>wearing</b> <b>their</b> maroon change kit, the match {{finished}} goalless, with Tony Coleman missing a penalty. The replay at Elm Park was a one-sided affair. City won 7–0, Mike Summerbee scoring a hat-trick. In the fourth round, another home tie finished 0–0, this time against Leicester City. In the replay Manchester City squandered a 2–0 lead and lost 4–3.|$|E
5|$|Before {{they were}} {{destroyed}} in the Revolution, {{the remains of the}} king and queen lay in the mortuary chamber below. Catherine's effigy suggests sleep rather than death, while Henry is posed strikingly, with his head thrown back. From 1583, Pilon also sculpted two later gisants of Catherine and Henry <b>wearing</b> <b>their</b> crowns and coronation robes. In this case, he portrays Catherine realistically, with a double chin. These two statues were intended to flank the altar of the chapel. Pilon's four bronze statues of the cardinal virtues stand at the corners of the tomb. Pilon also carved the reliefs round the base that recall Bontemps' work on the monument for the heart of Francis I.|$|E

5|$|In 2009, German {{manufacturer}} Adidas and Murray {{signed a}} five-year-deal worth £30 million. This included <b>wearing</b> <b>their</b> range of tennis shoes. The contract with Adidas allowed Murray {{to keep his}} shirt sleeve sponsors Shiatzy Chen, Royal Bank of Scotland and Highland Spring. Before he was signed by Adidas in late 2009, he wore Fred Perry apparel. At {{the end of their}} contract together Adidas decided not to re-sign with Murray, and he began a 4-year partnership with athletic apparel company Under Armour in December 2014, reportedly worth $25 million. Murray uses Head rackets, and regularly appears in advertisements for the brand.|$|E

Edna {{activates}} a beacon she built into the suits so Helen can find Bob, inadvertently causing him to be discovered and captured.

Working on a story in Yemen, she is joined by her ex-husband and Sully, and joins their hunt {{for the city of}} Ubarr. Over the course of the adventures, Nate and Elena reconcile and resume <b>wearing</b> <b>their</b> wedding rings. In the teaser trailer for Uncharted 4: A Thief's End, Drake is still married to Elena, as his wedding ring can be seen on his hand.|$|E

5|$|Under Louis, {{only between}} 20 and 50 prisoners were usually {{held at the}} Bastille at any one time, {{although}} as many as 111 were held {{for a short period}} in 1703. These prisoners were mainly from the upper classes, and those who could afford to pay for additional luxuries lived in good conditions, <b>wearing</b> <b>their</b> own clothes, living in rooms decorated with tapestries and carpets or taking exercise around the castle garden and along the walls. By the late 17th century, there was a rather disorganised library for the use of inmates in the Bastille, although its origins remain unclear.|$|E
5|$|Watts-Russell {{suggested}} {{it would be}} enjoyable for the Breeders record at a studio in Scotland called the Palladium. It was a house that included a recording studio on the first floor, as well as bedrooms upstairs. The band members sometimes recorded <b>wearing</b> <b>their</b> pajamas, and more than once went to a local pub without changing into regular clothes. The studio was booked for two weeks, but the album itself only took several days to record; during the remaining time, the Breeders recorded a John Peel session, and a television crew filmed a video of the band.|$|E
5|$|Croitoru had {{a history}} of run-ins with the police. Many of his legal {{problems}} came while he was president of the Hamilton, Ontario chapter of the Satan's Choice Outlaw motorcycle club. He was arrested for trafficking cocaine and served ten months in prison. Soon after, he was convicted of assault and was given a sentence of seven months. He encountered more problems on December 15, 1996 when he and several friends from Satan's Choice were kicked out of a strip club for <b>wearing</b> <b>their</b> gang's colors. To get revenge, Croitoru and his friends planned to blow up the strip club. They changed their minds, however, and decided to bomb the local police station instead. The bomb caused $133,000 in damages to the Sudbury, Ontario police station and a nearby bank and injured a police officer. Croitoru and two friends were arrested and charged, but the trial did not begin until almost two years later.|$|E

5|$|Doctor Phlox treats her {{injury and}} discovers {{that she is}} one-quarter Skagaran. Meanwhile, back on the planet, Bennings hands in his deputy badge because MacReady orders him not to take any further action against the Skagarans. Archer returns in a shuttlepod along with T'Pol and a {{security}} crew, led by Lieutenant Reed — all <b>wearing</b> <b>their</b> modern uniforms. Landing {{in the center of}} town, he informs the Sheriff that he is from Earth and will return to help them once their mission is over. Bennings then shoots MacReady, starting a firefight. In the chaos, Archer is also shot by Bennings, but finally overpowers him in a fistfight. Enterprise then departs, but not before returning Bethany to the surface, and providing her with a PADD to educate the local children about Earth's recent history.|$|E
5|$|Each June, on Garter Day, {{the members}} of the Order, <b>wearing</b> <b>their</b> habits and garter insignia, meet at Windsor Castle. When any new Knights of the Garter are due for installation, an {{investiture}} ceremony is held in the Throne Room of Windsor Castle on the morning of Garter Day. This ceremony is attended by all Knights Companions of the order, wearing the ceremonial habits and garter insignia, and also by their wives. The wording of the oath sworn by the new knights at this ceremony and of the Admonitions addressed to them in turn by the prelate and chancellor of the order when the several items of insignia are placed upon them are extremely similar to the traditions of the past.|$|E
5|$|Republicans {{around the}} state {{expected}} the committee to recommend disqualification of enough ballots to make Goebel governor. Additional armed men from eastern Kentucky filled the capital. Taylor, recognizing that the slightest incident could lead to violence, ordered the men home, {{and many of them}} complied. Still, two or three hundred remained, awaiting the election committee's findings. Others remained as witnesses set to testify before the contest committee. Some of these Republican witnesses were arrested by local police, who were mostly Goebel partisans. Governor Taylor issued pardons for some of them, citing their claims that the police robbed them upon their arrest. To avoid arrest for carrying a concealed weapon, many of the Republican partisans began <b>wearing</b> <b>their</b> guns openly, adding to the tensions in the city, but effectively reducing the number of arrests by local police.|$|E
25|$|Teams will {{generally}} <b>wear</b> <b>their</b> third jerseys at home, although clubs may wear {{them as the}} visiting team as well. The Carolina Panthers are known to <b>wear</b> <b>their</b> electric blue third jerseys on the road (most notably in Tampa) if the home team opts to <b>wear</b> <b>their</b> white jerseys against the Panthers and depending on the circumstance. Since introducing a wolf grey alternate in 2012, the Seattle Seahawks have exclusively <b>worn</b> <b>their</b> alternates on the road. The Denver Broncos <b>wore</b> <b>their</b> alternate navy blue jerseys {{in a game against}} the Dallas Cowboys in 2013. The Jets have <b>worn</b> <b>their</b> Titans throwbacks once in 2007 against the Miami Dolphins at Dolphin Stadium in Miami Gardens.|$|R

Mick, Joey, and Craig <b>wore</b> <b>their</b> All Hope Is Gone masks for the whole show. An effigy of Paul Gray stood between Craig and Joey's drum kit. The effigy {{included}} Paul's self-titled mask, his self-titled jumpsuit and his left-handed bass guitar beside it. For the American leg of the tour, they <b>wore</b> <b>their</b> red Iowa jumpsuits along with some matching to their Iowa masks.|$|R
25|$|Players <b>wear</b> <b>their</b> {{respective}} team's uniforms. Players on {{the home}} team <b>wear</b> <b>their</b> club's white home uniforms, while players on the away team <b>wear</b> <b>their</b> club's gray road uniforms. Usually, a patch depicting the game's logo is sewn onto their jerseys and caps.|$|R
