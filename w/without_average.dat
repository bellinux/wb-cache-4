40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new behavior of autonomous moving multi-agents, whose agents stochastically move over a resource consisting of cells {{in accordance with}} transition probabilities, depending on other agents. We suppose interactions or coordination among agents such that an agent can not move to a destination cell occupied by agents more than the agents of a current cell. The first we show that a moving multiagent with an appropriate average moving speed is more stable than a moving multi-agent <b>without</b> <b>average</b> moving speed. Then the stability can be accelerated by giving appropriate moving speed for agents. The second {{result is that the}} resource utilization of a moving multi-agent with an appropriate average moving speed becomes higher than the resource utilization of a moving multiagent <b>without</b> <b>average</b> moving speed. Then the resource utilization can be accelerated by giving moving speed.

40|$|PURPOSE: To verify whether wall {{shear stress}} (WSS) can be {{assessed}} in a reproducible manner using automatic model-based segmentation of phase-contrast MR images by determination of flow volume and maximum flow velocity (Vmax) in cross-sections of these vessels. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The approach is based on fitting a 3 D paraboloid to the actual velocity profiles and on determining Vmax. WSS was measured in the internal carotid arteries of two groups of healthy young volunteers. The reproducibility of rescanning and repositioning was studied in the first group. In the second group a 1 -week and a 1 -month interval was investigated. Reproducibility was calculated by the intraclass correlation (ICC). RESULTS: The flow volume, Vmax, and WSS averaged over the cardiac cycle {{were found to be}} 287. 8 +/- 29. 7 mL/min, 37. 0 +/- 4. 6 cm/s, and 1. 13 +/- 0. 16 Pa, respectively. The diastolic WSS varied between 1. 00 +/- 0. 21 Pa <b>without</b> <b>averaging</b> to 0. 88 +/- 0. 16 Pa with temporal and spatial averaging. Systolic WSS was 1. 67 +/- 0. 33 Pa <b>without</b> <b>averaging</b> and 1. 67 +/- 0. 25 Pa with averaging. ICC varied between 0. 58 and 0. 87 <b>without</b> <b>averaging</b> and between 0. 75 and 0. 90 with averaging for WSS. CONCLUSION: WSS in MR images of the internal carotid artery {{can be assessed}} semiautomatically with good to excellent reproducibility without inter- or intraobserver variability using model-based postprocessin...|$|R
