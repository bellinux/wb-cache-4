Grievances about the camp system were numerous, from the poor quality food, the lack of leisure facilities (bathrooms and showers), and that the men were only paid twenty cents per day. Consequently, the RCWU's numbers quickly swelled. Much of the organizing drive for the RCWU took place in Vancouver at 52½ West Cordova Street.

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this research were (a) to explore and describe the relationships relative to {{the evaluation of the}} <b>work</b> of the <b>organizers,</b> expected legacy, and support for hosting the 2014 World Cup (WC) and the 2016 Olympic Games (OG); and (b) to compare Brazilians’ support for these two events. Social exchange theory (Blau & Scott, 1962) supported three structural models. Results indicated that Brazilians college students (n = 914) do not strongly support the country’s hosting of either the 2014 WC or the 2016 OG. They also do not believe the organizers adequately prepared the country to host the events, and, subsequently, do not have high positive legacy expectations. Mediated models indicated that higher perceptions of the <b>work</b> of the <b>organizers</b> in preparation for the sport mega-events predicted more positive legacy expectations of these events, and subsequently, larger intentions to support the events. Significant indirect effects indicated that a fully mediated model might be useful to describe relationships among intentions of support, expected legacy, and evaluations of the <b>work</b> of the <b>organizers</b> in preparing to host sport mega-events. Implications for theory and practice are discussed...|$|R
