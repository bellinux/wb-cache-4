For this reason, as Hoxha relates in his memoirs, [...] "The Khrushchevites were capable of anything and <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>our</b> own measures... Hysni and Ramiz stayed on in Moscow, as they had to sign the declaration" [...] while Hoxha left the Soviet Union by train and [...] "arrived in Austria, went down by train through Italy and from Bari returned safe and sound to Tirana on our own aircraft and {{went directly to the}} reception organized {{on the occasion of the}} 28th and 29th of November." ...|$|E
500|$|Filming {{took place}} in Virginia, Connecticut, New Jersey, California, and New York. The film {{shooting}} lasted an estimated 72 days. Spielberg originally intended to shoot War of the Worlds after Munich, but Tom Cruise liked David Koepp's script {{so much that he}} suggested Spielberg postpone the former while he would do the same with [...] Most of Munichs crew was brought in to work on War of the Worlds as well. In 2004, the production crews quickly were set up on both coasts to prepare for the start date, scouting locations up and down the Eastern Seaboard and preparing stages and sets which would be used when the company returned to Los Angeles after the winter holiday. Pre-production {{took place in}} only three months, essentially half the amount of time normally allotted for a film of similar size and scope. Spielberg notes, however, [...] "This wasn't a cram course for War of the Worlds. This was my longest schedule in about 12 years. <b>We</b> <b>took</b> <b>our</b> time." [...] Spielberg collaborated with crews at the beginning of pre-production with the use of previsualization, considering the tight schedule.|$|E

500|$|In September 2008, Thomas told Entertainment Weekly that [...] "I thought I had {{the idea}} broken, but I've hit a wall in the final act that I haven't quite figured out". Thomas {{explained}} {{that he had been}} very busy writing for Cupid and Party Down, both of which he created. In January 2009, TV Guide reported that the film was Thomas' first priority after Cupid. Thomas noted that as well as writing the script, someone would need to pay for the film, but indicated that producer Joel Silver was ready to green-light the film. In June 2009, Bell said [...] "I don't think it will ever happen, and here's why: [...] Rob Thomas and I had a powwow, and we were both 100 percent on board. <b>We</b> <b>took</b> <b>our</b> proposal to Warner Bros. and Joel Silver told us that there is no enthusiasm [...] to make a Veronica Mars movie, and that is unfortunately a roadblock we cannot compete with." [...] At the 2010 TCA Winter Press Tour, Rob Thomas stated that the movie wouldn't be happening, [...] "I would write it if anyone would finance it. If anyone's interested in making that movie I am available, Kristen's [...] available. I would love to do it. I think the closest we came was Joel [...] pushing it at Warner Bros. and they didn't bite. It has sort of gone away." [...] In April 2010, Thomas insisted, [...] "it's not dead. I continue to want to do it [...] We're still looking into it." [...] In June 2010, Silver was less optimistic about the film happening; [...] "we analyzed all these areas about it. I talked to the home video people, because a movie like that would be driven by video. The [...] didn't do that well... So they didn't feel there was a need or an audience." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jordan quickly {{produced}} some initial script drafts, which Featherstone {{took to the}} BBC; Gareth Neame, Head of Drama Commissioning, rapidly approved a six-part series. Featherstone assembled a production team that had considerable overlap with the Spooks crew, including Simon Crawford Collins as producer and Matthew Graham as co-writer. In creating the first episodes, Jordan drew inspiration from the long tradition of confidence tricks and heists in Hollywood and television, including The A-Team, The Sting and The Grifters (and in a similar vein, the films and TV series of Mission Impossible). Featherstone remarked that [...] "Ocean's Eleven was on around the time Bharat and I first spoke, and I think it helped to inspire us, but really <b>we</b> <b>took</b> <b>our</b> inspiration from a whole catalogue of movies and books... {{we wanted to make}} something that had the energy, verve, style and pure entertainment value of those sorts of films" [...] At the same time, the writers attempted to draw on the success of recent blockbusters such as Ocean's Eleven and speaking in an interview in December 2003, Crawford explained that [...] " [...] worked because of the interaction within the group – the plotlines were almost irrelevant".|$|E
