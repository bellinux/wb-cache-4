500|$|As Jim recaps the Dundies for the camera, Pam {{stares at}} Jim with dazed fascination and then falls off her stool, and Dwight springs to her rescue, {{thinking}} Pam {{is having a}} seizure. [...] He then tries {{to take off his}} dress shirt and tie, but a Chili's employee stops him. [...] After the party is over, Pam runs to the camera and screams [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> say that this was the best Dundies ever! Whoo!". In the parking lot, Pam admits to Jim that it was she who wrote the graffiti. She begins to ask Jim a question, but stops when she notices the camera. A Chili's employee then talks to the camera and says that Pam apparently was sneaking drinks off of others' tables, which is against the restaurant's rules. [...] He then tells the audience that he Xeroxed her driver's license and she is never welcome at Chili's again. Jim helps Pam into Angela Martin's (Angela Kinsey) car and smiles as they leave.|$|E
2500|$|Wuornos's {{execution}} {{took place}} on October 9, 2002. She died at 9:47a.m. EDT. She declined her last meal {{which could have been}} anything under $20 and opted {{for a cup of coffee}} instead. Her last words were, [...] "Yes, I <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> say I'm sailing with the rock, and I'll be back, like Independence Day, with Jesus. June 6, like the movie. Big mother ship and all, I'll be back, I'll be back." [...] She was the tenth woman in the United States and the second in Florida to be executed since the 1976 Supreme Court decision restoring capital punishment.|$|E
2500|$|A free agent, Martínez did {{not sign}} {{with a major}} league team during the winter. In March, he joined the Dominican Republic's squad for the 2009 World Baseball Classic, {{in an attempt to}} {{showcase}} his arm. Martínez pitched six scoreless innings with 6 strikeouts and no walks, but the team was quickly eliminated from the tournament and no MLB contract was forthcoming. In July 2009, Phillies scouts evaluated Martínez in two simulated games against the Phillies DSL team, leading to a one-year, $1-million contract. Martínez told reporters, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be the backup. If I could be the backup, that would be a great thing to have—a healthy Pedro behind everybody else, in case something happens. That would be a great feeling to have on a team, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe some tramps {{have had}} their {{headquarters}} here," [...] said Dick. [...] "It <b>would</b> be <b>just</b> <b>like</b> them <b>to</b> single out a spot like this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{may come}} in by mail-- most likely they will," [...] {{answered}} Dick. [...] "It <b>would</b> be <b>just</b> <b>like</b> him <b>to</b> send a letter and then telegraph afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jarvey!" [...] muttered Mr. Obray. [...] "Well, it <b>would</b> be <b>just</b> <b>like</b> him <b>to</b> join {{a fellow}} like Pankhurst. They were quite chummy when they both {{worked for the}} company." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{thought you}} <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> cheat me into buying {{a lot of}} your trash," [...] {{finished}} the restaurant proprietor. [...] "Well, you can't do anything of the kind, and you can take that for your impudence!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Penelope {{answered}} with her laugh. [...] "Yes! You've just missed the most delightful call, 'Rene. So easy and pleasant every way. Not a bit stiff! Mrs. Corey was so friendly! She didn't make one feel {{at all as}} if she'd bought me, and thought she'd given too much; and mother held up {{her head as if}} she were all wool and a yard wide, and she <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have anybody deny it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Greenhorns, flatheads! I {{knew the}} first house would keep mum {{and let the}} rest of the town get roped in; and I knew they'd lay for us the third night, and {{consider}} it was THEIR turn now. Well, it IS their turn, and I'd give something to know how much they'd take for it. I <b>WOULD</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> know how they're putting in their opportunity. They can turn it into a picnic if they want to--they brought plenty provisions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you can bet}} it was the Ritter crowd, or Ritter alone," [...] said Stuffer, quickly. [...] "It <b>would</b> be <b>just</b> <b>like</b> them <b>to</b> {{do their}} best to spoil your fun." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We want to {{look out}} that they don't get wise to what we are doing," [...] said Plum. [...] "It <b>would</b> be <b>just</b> <b>like</b> Nat <b>to</b> give us away, if he knew." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, that's a pity; I {{was sorry}} {{not to find}} you in the drawing-room, but I thought you <b>would</b> have <b>liked</b> <b>just</b> <b>to</b> see him,' said Mr. Edmonstone, disappointed, and apologizing.|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{tell you}} you’re not tabooed,” said he. “The Kanakas won’t go near you, that’s all. And who’s to make ’em? We traders {{have a lot}} of gall, I must say; we make these poor Kanakas take back their laws, and take up their taboos, and that, {{whenever}} it happens to suit us. But you don’t mean to say you expect a law obliging people to deal in your store whether they want to or not? You don’t mean to tell me you’ve got the gall for that? And if you had, it would be a queer thing to propose to me. I <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> point out to you, Wiltshire, that I’m a trader myself.” ...|$|E
6000|$|Livy {{was in a}} {{state of}} mind! She said it was too theatrically ridiculous; and that I would never be able to keep my mouth shut; that I would be sure to let it out and it would get into the papers--and she tried to make me promise--"Promise what?" [...] I said--"to be quiet about this? Indeed I won't--it's the best thing that ever happened; I'll tell it, and add to it; and I wish Joe and Howells were here to make it perfect; I can't make all the {{rightful}} blunders myself--it takes all three of us to do justice to an opportunity like this. I <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see Howells get down to his work and explain, and lie, and work his futile and inventionless subterfuges when that princess comes raging in here and wanting to know." [...] But Livy could not hear fun--it was not a time to be trying to be funny--we were in a most miserable and shameful situation, and if-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Jean Myles bides in London" [...] was {{the next}} {{remarkable}} news brought by Tommy from Thrums Street. [...] "And that ain't all, Magerful Tam is her man; and that ain't all, she has a laddie called Tommy and that ain't all, Petey and the rest has never seen her in London, but she writes letters to Thrums folks and they writes to Petey and tells him what she said. That ain't all neither, they canna find out what street she bides in, but it's on the bonny side of London, and it's grand, and she wears silk clothes, and her Tommy has velvet trousers, {{and they have a}} servant as calls him 'sir.' Oh, I <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> kick him! They often looks for her in the grand streets, but they're angry at her getting on so well, and Martha Scrymgeour said it were enough to make good women like her stop going reg'lar to the kirk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How funny!" [...] she exclaimed, {{knitting}} her brows. [...] "I can't {{remember any}} prisoner at the villa. Perhaps {{it was the}} cat. It <b>would</b> be <b>just</b> <b>like</b> Silvio <b>to</b> consider {{the release of a}} cat a important event." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fairly sure. Of course, {{we might}} have been mistaken. But we know he was in Crumville--Laura was sure of that--and it <b>would</b> be <b>just</b> <b>like</b> him <b>to</b> sneak up to our place to see what he could do to annoy or injure us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps they are!" [...] cried Dick. [...] "It <b>would</b> be <b>just</b> <b>like</b> them <b>to</b> {{join forces}} with Crabtree and Sobber. They are down and out, and need money, {{and all of them}} would expect to get a big stake out of this." ...|$|R
6000|$|It is {{pleasant}} {{always to}} see Love hiding {{his head with}} such pains, while his whole body is so clearly visible, as in this extract. This lady, it seems, is not a Cleopatra, only a Charmian; but presently we find that she is imperial. He does not love her, but he <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be ruined by her, nothing more. This glimpse of her, with her leopardess beauty, crossing the room and drawing men after her magnetically, is all we have. She {{seems to have been}} still living in 1848, and as Lord Houghton tells us, kept the memory of the poet sacred. [...] "She is an East-Indian," [...] Keats says, [...] "and ought to be her grandfather's heir." [...] Her name we do not know. It appears from Dilke's [...] "Papers of a Critic" [...] that they were betrothed: [...] "It is quite a settled thing between John Keats and Miss ----. God help them. It is a bad thing for them. The mother says she cannot prevent it, and that her only hope is that it will go off. He don't like any one to look at her or to speak to her." [...] Alas, the tropical warmth became a consuming fire! ...|$|E
6000|$|Jem was not there. Jem {{spent his}} evenings now {{studying}} for his entrance examination in the Ingleside garret. Jerry was {{down near the}} pond, trouting. Walter had been reading Longfellow's sea poems to the others and they were steeped in the beauty and mystery of the ships. Then they talked of {{what they would do}} when they were grown up--where they would travel--the far, fair shores they would see. Nan and Di meant to go to Europe. Walter longed for the Nile moaning past its Egyptian sands, and a glimpse of the sphinx. Faith opined rather dismally that she supposed she {{would have to be a}} missionary--old Mrs. Taylor told her she ought to be--and then she would at least see India or China, those mysterious lands of the Orient. Carl's heart was set on African jungles. [...] Una said nothing. She thought she <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> stay at home. It was prettier here than anywhere else. It would be dreadful when they were all grown up and had to scatter over the world. The very idea made Una feel lonesome and homesick. But the others dreamed on delightedly until Mary Vance arrived and vanished poesy and dreams at one fell swoop.|$|E

50|$|His idea is {{with this}} school {{is to prepare}} those who would <b>like</b> <b>to</b> {{continue}} a musical career and/or those who <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> explore their talents and/or those who <b>just</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> relax by playing some percussion instruments (percussion therapy).|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>would</b> be <b>just</b> <b>like</b> him <b>to</b> {{go off and}} get full of liquor," [...] muttered {{the young}} man, with a scowl. [...] "I really ought to part company with him. But when he is {{perfectly}} sober he certainly is a slick one," [...] he continued meditatively.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the game}} structure, Titans have neither Alignment, nor Domains. Titans as {{described}} through the game are kin to raw natural and universal power. Therefore giving alignment or domains assignments to these beings <b>would</b> be <b>just</b> <b>like</b> attempting <b>to</b> {{give them to}} a bolt of lightning, or gravity.|$|R

50|$|In 1982, Curtis A. Cates {{joined the}} school as a faculty member and {{eventual}} successor to Hearn as school director. Hearn had expressed a wish to the elders of Knight Arnold that he <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> study, teach, and write, so he was relieved of his administrative duties while he continued to teach for a time.|$|E
5000|$|In late 2013, McHenry started {{experiencing}} a painful lump {{in his leg}} and consulted a doctor who diagnosed it as osteosarcoma that had spread to his lungs. He announced the news on his Twitter page with an upbeat spin saying [...] "I got told yesterday that I have cancer. I <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> let you all know I'm staying positive and I'm going to fight it. Fuck Cancer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{may have}} gotten home during the last day or two," [...] said Snap, slowly, [...] "and it <b>would</b> be <b>just</b> <b>like</b> them <b>to</b> lay around waiting to play some mean trick on us. If they had gotten off with our {{clothing}} we'd {{have been in a}} fine pickle truly!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it has {{the stage}} to itself," [...] Villa urged. [...] "Besides, if it is painful, then we can go out. I'll go out with you. But I <b>just</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see how much better Jerry sings than does he. And it says an Irish terrier, too." ...|$|R
60|$|Chatterer {{opened his}} mouth to tell Peter and then closed it with a snap. He remembered just in time how hard it is for Peter to keep a secret. If he should tell Peter, it <b>would</b> be <b>just</b> <b>like</b> Peter <b>to</b> tell some one else without meaning to, and then it might get back to Shadow the Weasel.|$|R
5000|$|In the band's {{official}} statement concerning his departure, Shaun {{is quoted as}} saying, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> salute MDB for the good times and wish them all well in the future, I feel I am not ready to fulfill the duties in a manner befitting MDB at this time and have decided to stand down. I am sad to be leaving but at this time I feel {{it is for the}} greater good of the band".|$|E
5000|$|Parataxis is {{occasionally}} {{found in}} spontaneous utterances. An example {{might be the}} last words of a serial killer named Aileen Wuornos who killed seven men in Florida between 1989 and 1990. She was executed on October 9, 2002 and her last words were: [...] "Yes, I <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> say I’m sailing with the rock, and I’ll be back, like Independence Day, with Jesus.

5000|$|Jack Lemmon won {{his second}} career Oscar that night; his first was for 1955's Mister Roberts. As he {{accepted}} the award, he announced that [...] "In recent years, especially, {{there has been a}} great deal of criticism about this award. And probably, a great deal of that criticism is very justified; I <b>would</b> <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> say that, whether it is justified or not, I think it is one hell of a honor and I am thrilled, and I thank you all, very, very much." ...|$|E

60|$|Robina paused. Not {{for want}} of material, I judged, so much as want of breath. Veronica {{performed}} a useful service by seizing the moment to express a hope {{that it was not}} early-closing day. Robina felt a conviction that it was: it <b>would</b> be <b>just</b> <b>like</b> Dick <b>to</b> stand there dawdling in a corner till {{it was too late to}} do anything.|$|R

And ma says he's taken a notion to you--she knows {{by the way he}} looked at you when you were singing night before last.
