25|$|The Toronto Port Authority (TPA) {{came into}} being on June 8, 1999 and the THC was dissolved. Unlike the {{previous}} Harbour Commission, the Port Authority used a different management structure and a different management focus. Its new board of directors contained only one City of Toronto-appointed member. The Authority was also expected to manage the port more like a business. The new authority entered into negotiations with the City of Toronto. It wanted $20 million from the City, the return of lands transferred to the City in 1994, and to be exempt from municipal property taxes, while the City <b>wanted</b> <b>out</b> from its $2.8 million annual subsidy.

After going round the world, Oswald embarked on a political career, becoming Conservative Party MP for Colchester in 1929, and holding the seat until 1945. John Lewis died aged 92 in 1928, and Spedan Lewis became sole owner of the Oxford Street business, in addition to Peter Jones. That same year, he bought the premises of T J Harries on the eastern side of Holles Street in Oxford Street, into which he expanded John Lewis.|$|E
25|$|There were {{conditions}} to who the CIA wanted to enlist, {{and they had}} specific uses that they <b>wanted</b> <b>out</b> of the Cubans that they brought aboard to the Cuban Opposition Front. They were supposed to restore the Cuban constitution that was made in 1940, they must be pro-Western and anti-Communist, they must be relatively politically neutral, {{and be able to}} gather other Cuban's support. Their purpose was summarized to three points, a beacon to attract other anti-Castro groups, a scapegoat in case covert operations were discovered, and to act as a potential replacement to Castro after his fall. As early as June 1960, there were 500 Cuban exiles being trained as paramilitary members in order to execute the Bay of Pigs, with some of those exiles being trained in Panama. This was due, partially, to the Soviet Union and its increasing amount of weaponry, along with a much larger influence of the Communist Party in Cuba.|$|E

The case was involving {{one of the young}} Dubois brothers and a merchant from St. Henri who had been beaten after he had refused to pay his daily receipt to the brothers’ hold up men. Mercier believed that the Dubois Brothers were getting help from someone on the inside as the victim was almost sentenced and the Dubois brother had only received a small fine. The Dubois Brothers also received permits, swung votes to which person they wanted through intimidation and were able to get judges to give reduced sentences. They had corrupted a journalist in order to have the journalist change information they needed and report information they <b>wanted</b> <b>out</b> but with his change of careers, due to the company finding out about his corruption, the Dubois Brothers turned him into their lawyer opening an office and giving them legal information. They were able to corrupt politicians, the police, judges and lawyers according to Mercier causing them a vast integration into society.|$|E
