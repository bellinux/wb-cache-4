500|$|Alignment in D—which determines a character's {{ethical and}} moral {{perspective}} on the independent axes of [...] "good vs. evil" [...] and [...] "law vs. chaos"—is a static property, chosen by the player {{at the start of}} a game. In Planescape: Torment, the character begins as a [...] "true neutral" [...] character (that is, neither good nor evil, and neither lawful nor chaotic) and throughout the game, based on the character's actions, this property is incrementally changed. Non-player characters respond to The Nameless One differently, depending on his alignment. A review in NextGen reported that [...] "the game caters to both the goody-goody player who wants to be nice and lawful, and the evil bastards <b>who</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> to kill everything and take no guff from anyone".|$|E

500|$|... "Save the Last One" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed by television critics. IGN's Eric Goldman praised the episode, {{giving it a}} nine out of ten, signifying an [...] "amazing" [...] rating. He opined {{that it was his}} favorite episode since the series' pilot episode, [...] "Days Gone Bye", and added that [...] "it had scary zombie scenes, good action, interesting character interaction and a revelation at the end that gave us a whole lot to process." [...] John Serba of The Grand Rapids Press was split on [...] "Save the Last One"; while asserting that it was [...] "imminently watchable", he felt that the episode was unbalanced as a whole and criticized the dialogue. Serba wrote: [...] "The show continues to display a disproportionate amount of dialogue compared to the development of its characters. It needs {{to do a better job}} of biding its time between crowd-pleasing zombie attacks." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall echoed similar thoughts, opining, [...] "the characters need more depth. The show seems to be setting itself out to be a slow-burning character study in the context of a zombie apocalypse — and with enough chase scenes and other scares to entice folks <b>who</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> brain-eating action — and the characters need to be more complex than they've been shown to be so far." ...|$|E

The announcement led to panned reception amongst Netflix's Facebook followers, who posted negative comments on its wall. Twitter comments spiked a negative [...] "Dear Netflix" [...] trend. The company defended its decision during its initial announcement of the change:"Given the long life we think DVDs by mail will have, treating DVDs as a $2 add-on to our unlimited streaming plan neither makes great financial sense nor satisfies people <b>who</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> DVDs.
