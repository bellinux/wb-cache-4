50|$|At Marlpit Hill {{the road}} makes a small {{direction}} change {{of only three}} degrees, and almost entirely keeps to this line to the high ground of Ashdown Forest. The straight run of Edenbridge High Street, crossing the River Eden and continuing to Dencross, where it continues as a private drive, is the most impressive surviving section of the road. Beyond this the road has been lost, seen only in hedgelines and traces of iron slag metalling in fields. In Peters Wood at Holtye an agger with iron slag metalling can be seen and on a footpath south of the A264 road a length of almost 100 metres of intact road was excavated in 1939, revealing a slag metalled surface in excellent condition and showing <b>wheel</b> <b>marks.</b> Part of this area south of the road has been kept uncovered by the Sussex Archaeological Trust. The agger is clearly visible south of this point and again at Butcherfield Lane, Hartfield, where 40 cm of slag metalling was found on a large wide agger. The road then climbs a small steep hill in an engineered cutting. At Chuck Hatch the road enters Ashdown Forest, zig-zagging to cross a gill at Loneoak Hall, then maintaining its straight line onto the high forest. It then turns 46 degrees west and uses a number of straight alignments to follow the ridge to Camp Hill. This forest section was metalled with sandstone, and was more clearly visible before being damaged by tank training exercises during World War II. Distinct side ditches near Camp Hill are 19 m apart.|$|E

40|$|The {{material}} removal {{characteristics of a}} silicon wafer were experimentally investigated {{with respect to the}} chemical dissolution and mechanical abrasion of the wafer during silicon chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) using an alkali-based slurry. The silicon surface without native oxide is rapidly dissolved by the slurry containing an amine agent, which effectively leads to the reduced hardness of the loaded silicon wafer due to Siâ€“Si bond breaking during polishing. The abrasive particles in the slurry easily remove the reacted silicon surface, and the removal rate and wafer non-uniformity for abrasive concentrations of 1. 5 â€“ 3 wt% are better than those for other concentrations because of the low and steady coefficient of friction (COF) owing to the evenness of abrasive particles between the wafer and pad. Also, it was found that a high slurry flow rate of 700 â€“ 1000 cm 3 /min improves wafer non-uniformity owing to the reduced temporal variation of temperature, because the slurry acts as a good cooling source during polishing. However, the removal rate remains almost constant upon varying the slurry flow rate because of the effective dissolution characteristic of the slurry with abundant amine as an accelerator, regardless of the reduction of average temperature with increasing slurry flow rate. In the break-in process used to stabilize the {{material removal}}, the viscoelastic behaviors of the pad and the ground wafer surface with native oxide and <b>wheel</b> <b>marks</b> cause a temporal change of the friction force during polishing, which is related to the removal rate and wafer non-uniformity. As a result, the stabilization of removal rate and wafer non-uniformity is achieved through a steady-state process with elevated temperature and reduced COF after a total polishing time of 60 min, based on the removal process of the wafer surface and the permanent deformation in the viscoelastic behavior of the pad...|$|E
40|$|Methods of {{evaluating}} the techniques and equipment used for direct drilling of seeds into untilled soils were reviewed and developed. Field tests {{were used to}} highlight seedling establishment problems and were complimented by a tillage bin technique which sought to isolate variables such as climate, soil type and soil moisture regime. The tillage bin technique involved collecting half-tonne undisturbed blocks of turf in open ended steel bins using a special turf cutting machine. These tillage bins were subjected to a common climate and moisture supply by placing them beneath transparent rain canopies and applying water artificially. Drilling utilized a support bed on which several bins were placed end to end and which was straddled by a moving gantry and tool testing apparatus operating on rails alongside. This facility allowed close visual appraisal {{to be made of}} the action of coulters and seed deposition and was operated at speeds which were infinitely variable, within limits. Seed metering was precisely controlled and selected coulter forces and soil physical properties were measured with the apparatus. Turf blocks, in their tillage bins, were returned to the rain protection canopies after drilling for plant response studies. Soil cover over the seed appeared to be important in promoting seedling emergence. Field covering devices were evaluated and a bar harrow was developed and adopted as a standard covering procedure. The importance of covering the seed appeared to be more pronounced with large seeds such as maize and barley than with smaller seeds such as lucerne. A strong relationship between visual scoring of the amount and type of cover, and seedling emergence data was established. This favoured covering media with a predominance of unbroken dead pasture mulch, compared with loose soil and rubble. The performances of a range of drill coulters operating at slow speeds in association with the bar harrow, were compared in terms of plant responses under soil moisture stress. An experimental chisel coulter was developed to obviate the noted shortcomings of some of these existing coulters. In contrast to the "V" shaped grooves left by most coulters, the chisel confined most of its soil disturbance to sub surface layers, with a narrow opening at the surface. With all coulters, seed germination appeared to be less affected by coulter design than seedling emergence because of sub surface mortality of seedlings. In this respect clear seedling emergence responses favoured the chisel coulter. Maximum wheat seedling emergence with the chisel coulter assembly was 77 %, which was significantly greater than hoe and triple disc coulters with 27 % and 26 % respectively. As the initial soil moisture level was raised in other experiments the magnitude of these differences decreased but the order of ranking remained. A 22 % comparative decrease in initial soil moisture content was necessary to reduce the performance of the chisel coulter to a similar level to that of the hoe and triple disc coulters. Difficulty was experienced in accurately monitoring in-groove soil moisture regimes, but irrigation responses and gravimetric determinations of sub samples suggested that the ability of grooves to retain available soil moisture was a critical factor in the plant emergence responses. Soil temperatures appeared not to be greatly affected by coulter type in these experiments although the in-groove minimum temperature with the chisel coulter was significantly higher than the hoe and triple disc coulters in one experiment. Observation of the modes of action of coulters showed that the chisel and hoe coulters produced some upward soil heaving while the triple disc appeared to operate with a downward and outward wedging action in the soil. An increase in soil density under the groove resulted from passage of the triple disc coulter but no effect on density was seen with the chisel or hoe coulters. The down forces required for 38 mm penetration of all coulters tested, appeared also to be closely related to their modes of action and relatively insensitive to soil moisture content in the stress range. In this respect the triple disc required 1. 4 times more force than the dished disc coulter and from 2. 3 to 4. 6 times more force than a range of 4 other coulters. Field tests of the wear rates of chisel coulters constructed of various steel based materials, with and without hardening treatments, suggested a number of preferred treatments but could not establish any difference in wear rate from coulters operating in the tractor <b>wheel</b> <b>marks</b> compared with those operating in unmarked soil...|$|E
