In 1986, Dan Winkler began work on HyperTalk and the name was changed to HyperCard for trademark reasons. It was initially released in August 1987, with the understanding that Atkinson would give HyperCard to Apple only if the company promised to release it for free on all Macs. Apple timed its release to coincide with the MacWorld Conference & Expo in Boston, Massachusetts to guarantee maximum publicity.|$|E
500|$|A good tragedy or novel, if the {{criterion}} be the effect {{which it has}} on the reader, {{is not always the}} most moral <b>work,</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> is not the reveries of sentiment, but the struggles of passion — of those human passions, that too frequently cloud the reason, and lead mortals into dangerous errors... which raise the most lively emotions, and leave the most lasting impression on the memory; an impression rather made by the heart than the understanding: for our affections are not quite voluntary as the suffrages of reason.

500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E

500|$|By late 1995, Jack Wall {{was living}} in Los Angeles and was married to singer Cindy Shapiro, who he had met in 1994. She knew Ron Martinez, who was {{starting}} a video game company, PostLinear Entertainment, and he asked Wall to <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> as a composer. He composed the soundtracks for several games for PostLinear; the first released was Vigilance in 1997. His daughter Gracie was also born early in 1997. After leaving the company, he composed the soundtrack to 2001's , which was his first orchestral score and the work that he said {{put him on the}} map as a video game composer. It was also interesting to him, as it was a sequel to the first video game he had ever played, Myst. Myst III was nominated for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences [...] "Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition" [...] award, which it lost to the Tropico soundtrack.|$|E
500|$|Early {{supporters}} fell largely {{into three}} types: committed Eurosceptics, disaffected Conservatives, and those who—though not necessarily being Eurosceptic—strongly {{believed that the}} British population deserved a referendum on EU membership. At the time the new party was largely seen {{as a threat to}} the governing Conservative Party, which was experiencing high levels of mid-term unpopularity. In September 1995, the party began recruiting candidates to contest the next general election. Goldsmith was also able to obtain celebrity endorsements. Despite Goldsmith's longstanding criticism of the mainstream media—he had previously stated that [...] "reporting in England is a load of filth"—the party used its finances to promote its message in the media. It hired Ian Beaumont, who had formerly been the press officer to Thatcher's government, to <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> The party paid for many full-page and some double-page advertisement in the UK's national newspapers, as well as two cinema advertisements. This generated criticism from those who accused it of [...] "cheque-book politics" [...] in the manner of Perot in the US. This financial backing and infrastructure contrasted with that of another single-issue Eurosceptic Party, the UK Independence Party (UKIP), which was operating with little finances and a skeleton organisation at the time.|$|E
500|$|The Poor Law Act of 1388 was {{an attempt}} to address the labour {{shortage}} caused by the Black Death, a devastating pandemic that killed about one-third of England's population. [...] The new law fixed wages and restricted the movement of labourers, as it was anticipated that if they were allowed to leave their parishes for higher-paid work elsewhere then wages would inevitably rise. [...] According to historian Derek Fraser, the fear of social disorder following the plague ultimately resulted in the state, and not a [...] "personal Christian charity", becoming responsible for the support of the poor. [...] The resulting laws against vagrancy were the origins of state-funded relief for the poor. From the 16th century onwards a distinction was legally enshrined between those who were able to work but could not, and those who were able to work but would not: between [...] "the genuinely unemployed and the idler". [...] Supporting the destitute was a problem exacerbated by King Henry VIII's Dissolution of the Monasteries, which began in 1536. [...] They had been a significant source of charitable relief, and provided a good deal of direct and indirect employment. The Poor Relief Act of 1576 went on to establish the principle that if the able-bodied poor needed support, they had to <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{second part}} of the Memorial {{described}} suggestions for the social and political organization of Indian communities relative to colonial ones. Las Casas advocated the dismantlement of the city of Asunción and the subsequent gathering of Indians into communities of about 1,000 Indians to be situated as satellites of Spanish towns or mining areas. Here, Las Casas argued, Indians could be better governed, better taught and indoctrinated in the Christian faith, and would be easier to protect from abuse than if they were in scattered settlements. Each town would have a royal hospital built with four wings {{in the shape of a}} cross, where up to 200 sick Indians could be cared for at a time. He described in detail social arrangements, distribution of work, how provisions would be divided and even how table manners were to be introduced. Regarding expenses, he argued that [...] "this should not seem expensive or difficult, because after all, everything comes from them [...] and they <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> and it is theirs." [...] He even drew up a budget of each pueblo's expenses to cover wages for administrators, clerics, Bachelors of Latin, doctors, surgeons, pharmacists, advocates, ranchers, miners, muleteers, hospitalers, pig herders, fishermen, etc. He showed that this arrangement could easily be maintained and gold still be extracted at a profit.|$|E

As Polly Toynbee, a columnist for the guardian states „There are no reasons why top pay has shot through the roof since the 1980s, except that people tend to take what they can if there is no one to stop them.“ [...] The market will then require regulatory measures as to create a functional economic system.|$|E

2500|$|Stewart led a {{detachment}} of his regiment at the Battle of Germantown on 4 October 1777. As Greene's wing advanced on the British positions, Stewart's unit covered Weedon's left flank where a gap had developed between that brigade and Alexander McDougall's Connecticut Brigade. After driving off two British light infantry companies, his men captured an earthwork near Luken's Mill. He wrote Gates, [...] "I {{took a little}} redoubt with three Pieces of Cannon from them". He noted that, [...] "It was cursed Hot <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> before they left them". He noted that his men started fighting [...] from Germantown and penetrated the British lines {{as far as the}} Market House. Another officer recalled that the Pennsylvania State Regiment had overcome all resistance in its front. When it was attacked on its left and rear, [...] "Gen. Steven [...] ordered Col. Stewart to evacuate the ground". On 12 November 1777, the regiment was renamed the 13th Pennsylvania Regiment.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the years}} {{shortly after the}} {{protectorate}} was founded in 1891, little of the land on European estates was planted, as few African workers were resident on estate lands at that time. Many of the Certificates of Claim issued to settlers contained “non-disturbance” clauses allowing these existing residents to continue to cultivate their existing fields rent-free [...] Many of the new workers who moved onto estates were so-called [...] "Anguru", migrants from Mozambique who were required to pay rent, usually satisfied by two months’ labour {{a year in the}} early years, under the system known as thangata although later many owners required a longer period of work. R S Hynde, the General Manager of Blantyre and East Africa Ltd, made an agreement with the headmen of villages on the company's estates in Cholo District under which the villagers were to give up their rights under the non-disturbance clause and become the company’s tenants, working for two months during the growing season in lieu of rent and Hut tax. If any of the villagers worked for another employer they were to pay their rent and taxes in cash, and those who could not <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> or pay rent were to be liable to be evicted. In 1903, the administration asked the High Court to cancel this agreement, as it contravened the non-disturbance clause. The court accepted that the villagers’ rights protected by the non-disturbance clause could not be exchanged for an insecure tenancy under an illegal thangata agreement.|$|E
