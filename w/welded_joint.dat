500|$|The {{selection}} of a shielding gas depends on several factors, including the type of material being <b>welded,</b> <b>joint</b> design, and desired final weld appearance. [...] Argon is {{the most commonly used}} shielding gas for GTAW, since it helps prevent defects due to a varying arc length. When used with alternating current, argon shielding results in high weld quality and good appearance. Another common shielding gas, helium, is most often used to increase the weld penetration in a joint, to increase the welding speed, and to weld metals with high heat conductivity, such as copper and aluminum. A significant disadvantage is the difficulty of striking an arc with helium gas, and the decreased weld quality associated with a varying arc length.|$|E

Experiment one was conducted to see the signal characters on defected <b>welding</b> <b>joint</b> meanwhile for experiment two for non-defected <b>welding</b> <b>joint.</b> The same procedures were applied for both experiments. MIG welding process was run to joint two plate of mild steel.

The weld pads were subsequently given a postweld hear treatment (PWHT) of 973 K for I hour.
