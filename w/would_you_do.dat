In World Literature Today, Bettina L. Knapp wrote that the play presented theatre-goers with the dilemma: what <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> with Hitler were he to surface today? Skloot noted that while the [...] "facts" [...] in Steiner's work are pure fiction, the play confronts the audience with an event that cannot be resolved with traditional [...] "logic, facticity and morality".
