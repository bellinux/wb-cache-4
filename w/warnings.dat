5|$|As Bob moved {{towards the}} U.S. Gulf Coast, the National Weather Service issued gale <b>warnings</b> for coastal regions {{extending}} from Vermilion Bay, Louisiana to Biloxi, Mississippi at 1600 UTC on July 10. These <b>warnings</b> were upgraded to hurricane <b>warnings</b> upon Bob's strengthening {{to such an}} intensity. During the storm's existence, forecasts and predictions from the National Hurricane Center were of greater accuracy than on average. In addition to tropical cyclone <b>warnings</b> and watches, the agency also advised small craft from Port Arthur, Texas to Pensacola, Florida to remain in port.|$|E
5|$|At noon on September 3, a {{hurricane}} watch was issued for the Leeward Islands, which at 6 p.m. was upgraded to a warning. Also at 6 p.m., hurricane watches were raised for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, which at 6 a.m. on September 4, were upgraded to <b>warnings.</b> By 6 a.m. on September 5, hurricane <b>warnings</b> were dropped for the Leeward Islands, and at 9 a.m., southwest Puerto Rico and the Virgin Island's hurricane <b>warnings</b> were downgraded to gale <b>warnings.</b> By noon, all remaining hurricane <b>warnings</b> for Puerto Rico were changed to gale <b>warnings.</b> In Puerto Rico, flood <b>warnings</b> were issued on September 5, although some {{residents in the}} region did not heed the notice; many returned to their homes after the hurricane passed to the north. On Vieques Island, about 1,700 United States Marines evacuated to naval ships. Officials advised small boats to remain at port, and thousands of residents evacuated to schools set up as Red Cross shelters. Along the Cuban coast, about 3,000people evacuated inland or to churches and schools; while in the Bahamas, stores closed and boats were sent to port.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model for the design of {{effective}} <b>warning</b> labels concerning drinking and driving. One important aspect of the model is that producing a multiplicity of <b>warning</b> labels should result in a higher probability that at least a few of the <b>warning</b> labels will be of high quality and effectiveness. Secondly, greater similarity between the <b>warning</b> label designer and the intended target group should enhance the effectiveness of the <b>warning</b> label. In the present study, 49 <b>warning</b> labels were created by university undergraduates, and the effectiveness of these <b>warning</b> labels was assessed by a group of university students (target group members). A number of labels were judged as being effective, and more effective than the government <b>warning</b> label. Extending the notion of being close to the target group, <b>warning</b> labels designed by male and female university students for university students of the same sex were judged as more effective than <b>warning</b> labels designed for the opposite sex. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{examined the}} influence of <b>warning</b> quality, container hazardousness, and severity of the potential injury on attention to and retention of <b>warning</b> information. Warning quality and container hazardousness were manipulated as within subjects variables, severity of injury as a between subjects variable. Two levels of each variable were used, high and low. Participants viewed the four possible combinations of <b>warning</b> quality and container hazardousness and then responded to various questions concerning their perceptions and retention of <b>warning</b> information. The results demonstrated the importance of <b>warning</b> quality. Enhanced features such as pictorials, signal words, safety icons, and color increase <b>warning</b> salience and recollection of <b>warning</b> information. The results also indicate that the hazardousness of containers influences whether people read <b>warning</b> labels and subsequent reports of cautious intent. However, its influence is modified by both severity of injury and <b>warning</b> quality...|$|R
