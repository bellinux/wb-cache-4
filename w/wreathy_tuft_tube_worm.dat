5000|$|One of {{the places}} where Thermarces cerberus has been found is in the {{vicinity}} of subterranean vents on the Alarc√≥n Rise, near the mouth of the Gulf of California at depths of about 2300 m. Here there are active and inactive [...] "chimneys" [...] in close proximity to long fissures in the seabed. The most vigorous active chimneys emit mineral-rich fluids at over [...] known as [...] "black smoke" [...] while less active chimneys emit [...] "white smoke". The active chimneys are covered in mats of bacteria and <b>tufts</b> of giant <b>tube</b> <b>worms</b> (Riftia pachyptila). Growing on the <b>tube</b> <b>worms,</b> some of which are 1.5 metres (5 ft) tall, are numerous limpets. Moving about among the worms are the crab Bythograea thermydron, crabs in the family Galatheidae and the pink vent fish.|$|R

5000|$|Lamellibrachia is a genus of <b>tube</b> <b>worms</b> {{related to}} the giant <b>tube</b> <b>worm,</b> Riftia pachyptila. It lives at deep-sea cold seeps where {{hydrocarbons}} (oil and methane) are leaking out of the seafloor. It is entirely reliant on internal, sulfide-oxidizing bacterial symbionts for its nutrition.|$|R

5000|$|With {{sunlight}} {{not available}} directly {{as a form}} of energy, the <b>tube</b> <b>worms</b> rely on bacteria in their habitat to oxidize hydrogen sulfide, using dissolved oxygen in the water as an electron acceptor. This reaction provides the energy needed for chemosynthesis. For this reason, <b>tube</b> <b>worms</b> are partially dependent on sunlight as an energy source, since they use free oxygen, which has been liberated by photosynthesis in water layers far above, to obtain nutrients. In this way <b>tube</b> <b>worms</b> are similar to many forms of ocean life which live at depths that sunlight cannot penetrate. However, <b>tube</b> <b>worms</b> are remarkable in being able to use bacteria to indirectly obtain almost all the materials they need for growth from molecules dissolved in water. Some nutrients have to be filtered out of the water. <b>Tube</b> <b>worm</b> growth resembles that of hydroponically grown fungi more than it does that of typical animals which need to [...] "eat". One other species is known to have a very similar lifestyle: the giant shipworm (which is a mollusc, not a worm, though it bears a superficial resemblance).|$|R

Twenty-eight serpulid taxa have been reported, increasing both diversity and density values from most photophilic to most sciaphilous habitats.
