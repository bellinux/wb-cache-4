5|$|In {{one of the}} interludes of The Loves of the Plants, {{the voice}} of the Poet, which <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Darwin's voice as well, argues that poetry is meant to appeal to the senses, {{particularly}} vision. Darwin's primary tool for accomplishing this was personification. Darwin's personifications were often based on the classical allusions embedded with Linnaeus's own naming system. However, they were not meant to conjure up images of gods or heroes; rather, the anthropomorphized images of the plants depict more ordinary images. They also stimulate the readers' imaginations to assist them in learning the material and allow Darwin to argue that the plants he is discussing are animate, living things—just like humans. Darwin's use of personification suggests that plants are more akin to humans than the reader might at first assume; his emphasis on the continuities between mankind and plantkind contributes to the evolutionary theme that runs throughout the poem.|$|E

25|$|Evidence of the biasing {{power of}} the conduit metaphor {{can be found in}} fields outside of linguistics. Information theory, with its concept-free {{algorithms}} and computers as models, <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> immune from effects arising from semantic pathology, because the framework shares many attributes with the toolmakers paradigm. Nevertheless, there is evidence that use of the conduit metaphor has hampered investigators' attempts to develop the theory.|$|E
25|$|From the {{viewpoint}} of the astronaut, on-board clocks seem to be running normally. The star ahead seems to be approaching at a speed of 0.87 light years per ship-year. The universe would appear contracted along the direction of travel to half the size it had when the ship was at rest; the distance between that star and the Sun <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 16 light years {{as measured by the}} astronaut.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theme is}} a kind of {{military}} racism, or species-ism. The Mushrooms are clearly described as different, although they <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> human, to some extent. However, when it comes to battle, the Mushrooms are treated like non-humans or animals—alien. Killing them is necessary, impersonal, and raises no questions of conscience. The Minnipins feel no pity for their enemy, even as the story describes the shrieks from the Mushrooms as they are killed.|$|E

25|$|Light {{sources and}} illuminants may be {{characterized}} by their spectral power distribution (SPD). The relative SPD curves provided by many manufacturers may have been produced using 10nm increments or more on their spectroradiometer. The result is what <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a smoother ("fuller spectrum") power distribution than the lamp actually has. Owing to their spiky distribution, much finer increments are advisable for taking measurements of fluorescent lights, and this requires more expensive equipment.|$|E
25|$|These time {{intervals}} <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reversed; {{this is an}} {{area where}} public policy trumps science. The idea is that for women beyond age 35, every month counts and if made to wait another 6 months to prove the necessity of medical intervention, the problem could become worse. The corollary to this is that, by definition, failure to conceive in women under 35 isn't regarded with the same urgency as it is in those over 35.|$|E
25|$|The late Eugene Shoemaker of the U.S. Geological Survey {{estimated}} {{the rate of}} Earth impacts, concluding that an event {{about the size of}} the nuclear weapon that destroyed Hiroshima occurs about once a year. Such events <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> spectacularly obvious, but they generally go unnoticed for a number of reasons: the majority of the Earth's surface is covered by water; a good portion of the land surface is uninhabited; and the explosions generally occur at relatively high altitude, resulting in a huge flash and thunderclap but no real damage.|$|E

The present question is of a Protestant-Papist matter; into which Friedrich Wilhelm has been drawn by his public spirit alone.|$|R
25|$|According to {{an article}} in the 24 November 1923 issue of the Auckland Star, in 1919 an {{additional}} report had been published in an unspecified Glasgow newspaper which suggested that the crew had been sighted on shore in 1891, but that the passing ship had been unable to rescue them. This <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken in part from the 1891 report by the Canadian sealing schooner Maud S. According to the Auckland Star, the Glasgow story also repeated the first story about the ship being discovered in 1913 with a dead crew on board.|$|E
25|$|The Biography of Early Australia dismisses Macarthur's {{complaints}} as {{ridiculous and}} quotes Evatt {{as saying that}} legally Macarthur was guilty of two out of the three charges brought against him including sedition. Both consider that Bligh was wholly justified in his actions {{because he was the}} legitimate authority. However, imprisoning people and threatening to do the same to the court when they failed to yield to the will of said authority <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> legally problematic. Duffy states that had Johnston arrived when summoned on 25 January the Rum Rebellion probably would never have happened.|$|E
25|$|Pahawh {{is written}} left to right. Each {{syllable}} is written with two letters, an onset (la, an initial consonant or consonant cluster) and a rime (yu, a vowel, diphthong, or vowel plus final consonant). However, {{the order of}} these elements is rime-initial, the opposite of their spoken order. (That is, each syllable <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> written right to left, if it were transcribed literally into the Roman alphabet.) This {{is an indication that}} Shong conceived of the rimes as primary; Pahawh Hmong might therefore {{be thought of as a}} vowel-centered abugida. Tones and many onsets are distinguished by diacritics.|$|E

40|$|The terms “narrative ” and “development ” {{would appear}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{difficult}} <b>to</b> relate to one another.

In this article, I seek to rethink both of these terms {{in such a way}} as to render them more compatible. In doing so, I focus on the idea of narrative identity, which, I suggest, is not only about the self but about the other-than-self, especially those goods that draw the process forward...|$|R

25|$|Typeface superfamilies {{began to}} emerge when {{foundries}} began to include typefaces with significant structural differences, but some design relationship, under the same general family name. Arguably the first superfamily was created when Morris Fuller Benton created Clearface Gothic for ATF in 1910, a sans serif companion to the existing (serifed) Clearface. The superfamily label does not include quite different designs given the same family name for what <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> purely marketing, rather than design, considerations: Caslon Antique, Futura Black and Futura Display are structurally unrelated to the Caslon and Futura families, respectively, and are generally not considered part of those families by typographers, despite their names.|$|E
25|$|Today the Eureka Flag {{has been}} adopted {{by a variety of}} groups, {{including}} the Builders Labourers Federation and the Australia First Party. The City of Ballarat and University of Ballarat, for instance have used stylised versions of the 'Southern Cross' in their official logo along with several trade unions and other associated groups. The Prospectors and Miners Association of Victoria use the Eureka Flag as their official flag and <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the only 'rightful' and 'correct' user of the flag today. They are the only lobby and interest group representing the rights of Gold Miners and Prospectors in the State of Victoria as the original Eureka Stockade rebellion members were.|$|E
25|$|Jacquetta is a main {{character}} in Philippa Gregory's 2009 novel The White Queen, a fictionalized {{account of the}} life of her eldest daughter Elizabeth. In the novel, Jacquetta is portrayed as having indeed dabbled quite a bit in witchcraft, displaying what <b>would</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> actual power. She is also the main protagonist in Gregory's 2011 prequel novel The Lady of the Rivers. Gregory's works explore the historical claim by Jacquetta's family that they were descended from the water deity Melusine. Gregory uses Jacquetta's tenuous ties to Melusine and Joan of Arc to further her potential ties to witchcraft. In the 2013 BBC One/Starz television series adaptation The White Queen, Jacquetta is portrayed by actress Janet McTeer.|$|E
