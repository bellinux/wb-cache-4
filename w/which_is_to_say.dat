This led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to light—a point which had been debated in prior years.|$|E

5|$|Many modern {{scholars}} {{contend that}} the seemingly Christian nature of the poem is due to Virgil referencing Eastern oracles, {{which may have been}} influenced by Jewish texts and prophecies. For instance, Robin Nisbet, after carefully analyzing the work, ultimately concluded that Virgil probably appropriated some elements used in the poem from Jewish mythology by means of Eastern oracles, and later adapted them towards Western (<b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> Roman) modes of thought.|$|E

The presentation gives examples of how, in an increasingly complex society, the views on why, for whom and how education is important changes. The starting point is the development of the Folk school, which despite of its designation, in the early days was a school for the few and on conditions <b>which</b> <b>were,</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the least, unequal, and led to the struggle for an inclusion of all groups in the educational system...|$|R

5|$|With ample {{current density}} and ionization, this forms a {{luminous}} electric arc (a continuous electric discharge similar to lightning) between the electrodes. Electrical resistance along the continuous electric arc creates heat, which dissociates more gas molecules and ionizes the resulting atoms (where degree of ionization {{is determined by}} temperature), and as per the sequence: solid-liquid-gas-plasma, the gas is gradually turned into a thermal plasma. A thermal plasma is in thermal equilibrium, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> that the temperature is relatively homogeneous throughout the heavy particles (i.e. atoms, molecules and ions) and electrons. This is so because when thermal plasmas are generated, electrical energy is given to electrons, which, due to their great mobility and large numbers, are able to disperse it rapidly and by elastic collision (without energy loss) to the heavy particles.|$|E

40|$|Axelrodが行った繰り返し囚人のジレンマゲームに関する一連の数値実験の結果によれば，TFT戦略を現実世界の囚人のジレンマ状況において採用することが推奨される．しかしながら，後の研究により彼のシミュレーション結果は様々な条件に依存しており，TFT戦略の平均的優位性は決して自明のものではないことが明らかになっている．本稿の目的はレプリケータ・ダイナミクスを模した数値実験により，この点を強調するとともに，従来のシミュレーション分析においては，どちらかといえば重要視されていなかったGRIM戦略の平均的優位性とエンフォーサーとしての役割を強調することにある．合わせて，多くのシミュレーション分析において観察される全面協力と全面裏切りの振動を抑える鍵が，上品であるがゆえに高い平均利得を獲得できるエンフォーサーの急成長にあることを示唆する．According to {{the results}} of a series of {{numerical}} experiments on Axelrod's iterated Prisoner's Dilemma game, people should adopt the tit-for-tat strategy for resolving dilemmas in the actual world. The success of this strategy is, however, by no means obvious, since the results depend heavily on various conditions of the experiments. This study reconsiders Axelrod's computer tournament and ecological system, as well as reconfirms that his results depend, in particular, on the set of strategies played in the game and their initial distribution. Moreover, we emphasize the success of the grim trigger strategy and its importance as an enforcer that suppresses the prosperity of naive cooperators and cunning defectors. The key to damping an oscillation, which appears in many simulations (and generates perpetual alternation between mutual cooperation and mutual defection), may be the rapid proliferation of nice enforcers <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> never being the first to defect...|$|R

There are about 17 such rules common to both Munsee and Unami, and another 28 unique to Unami, though this analysis ignores predictable exceptions, such as the class of static words which may skip many of these rules.
