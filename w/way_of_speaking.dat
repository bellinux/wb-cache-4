As the watch scouts the neighbor's house, Bob learns that Chelsea is at an unsupervised party with Jason. Bob disobeys Evan's orders and rushes to the party with Franklin. Bob prevents Jason from raping Chelsea, but Jason beats him until Franklin intervenes. Evan and Jamarcus investigate the odd neighbor alone, discovering that he hosts orgies in his basement. When Bob returns, he and Evan argue over his putting his daughter above the watch. Bob is fired from the watch after saying Evan has no friends because he tries to control everything. Evan goes home and admits his infertility to Abby, who accepts the news and tells him they will work things out.|$|E
5|$|Also {{noting the}} unachievable {{ambition}} {{of solving the}} conflict between naturalism and religion, Martin A Greenman, remarks that one must come to the book “with a certain mood”. Too critical a mood would blind the reader to its religious insights, while the sensitivity and depth of its philosophic insights would be lost {{if one were to}} approach it in a too enthusiastically religious mood. Greenman finishes by justifying Stace’s philosophy to logical positivists by quoting from Wittgenstein's Tractatus: “My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them….He must surmount these propositions: then he sees the world rightly” (6. 54.) Dorothy M. Emmet found issue with the notion that the mystical experience is the point of intersection between the temporal and eternal orders. She writes that there are difficulties in Stace defining these orders as two distinct “orders of being”, rather than just as a <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>speaking,</b> because this then means some statements about the temporal order are relevant to what is said about the eternal order and vice versa. Indeed, the interrelation between these two orders is difficult to maintain. She also questioned Stace’s characterisation of mystical consciousness as being the same everywhere.|$|E

25|$|Brazilian dialects {{are divided}} into {{northern}} and southern groups, the northern dialects tending to slightly more open pre-stressed vowels. The economic and cultural dominance of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro in Brazil made their dialects end up having some influence {{on the rest of}} the country.

Also, people of inner cities of the three southern states usually speak with a very notable German, Italian or Polish accent, and among the inhabitants of the Santa Catarina island (ie. insular Florianópolis), the Azorean Portuguese dialect, in its local variant, predominates.|$|E

500|$|To put {{it another}} way, a thing or person is often seen as having a [...] "defining essence" [...] or a [...] "core identity" [...] that is unchanging, and {{describes}} what the thing or person really is.

500|$|The {{character}} of [...] "Pee-wee Herman" [...] originated during a 1978 improvisation exercise with The Groundlings, where Reubens {{came up with}} the idea of a man who wanted to be a comic but was so inept at telling jokes that it was obvious to the audience that he would never make it. Fellow Groundling Phil Hartman would afterwards help Reubens develop the character while another Groundling, John Paragon, would help write the show. Despite having been compared to other famous characters, such as Hergé's Tintin and Collodi's Pinocchio, Reubens says that there is no specific source for [...] "Pee-wee" [...] but rather a collection of ideas. Pee-wee's voice originated in 1970 when Reubens appeared in a production of Life with Father, where he was cast as one of the most obnoxious characters in the play, for which Reubens adopted a cartoon-like <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>speaking</b> that would become Pee-wee's. Pee-wee's name resulted from a one-inch Pee Wee brand harmonica Reubens had as a child, and Herman was the surname of an energetic boy Reubens knew from his youth.

Davies had scripted dialogue in [...] "The Christmas Invasion" [...] explaining the newly regenerated Doctor's estuary English accent by stating he had imprinted on Rose and adopted her <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>speaking.</b> However, due to time constraints this sequence was not filmed. Discussing how Rose had developed by the second series, Piper described her as having [...] "come on in leaps and bounds" [...] and stated she is now [...] "a lot more proactive." [...] She felt that there is a [...] "different kind of energy" [...] between Rose and the Tenth Doctor, whilst Tennant remarked that the audience would get to see the Doctor-companion relationship [...] "developing and becoming something that it maybe hasn't before." [...] Piper stated that with the Tenth Doctor, Rose is [...] "more tetchy and more possessive" [...] over him as [...] "she feels like she's lost him once and doesn't want to lose him again". She cited Rose's [...] "catfight" [...] with former companion Sarah Jane Smith in [...] "School Reunion" [...] as evidence of this. Discussing the possibility of Rose and the Tenth Doctor becoming more romantically involved Piper stated [...] "You want it to happen, but at the same time you don't want it to happen". Tennant likened the dynamic between the pair to that of Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) in The X-Files. Both Tennant and Piper agreed that the expectation of the relationship is more exciting than having it realised. To add to the tragedy of their separation, Davies scripted the series two story arc so that Rose and the Doctor would be indirectly responsible for their separation. [...] "It's deliberate when that happens [...] ", said Davies, [...] "and they do pay the price. In [...] "Tooth and Claw", they set up the very thing— Torchwood— that separates them in the end. It's sort of their own fault." [...] Though Davies left the Doctor's response to Rose's declaration of love in [...] "Doomsday" [...] unstated, Gardner felt strongly that the character reciprocated her feelings.
