500|$|The {{polar group}} {{continued}} towards the Pole, passing Shackleton's Furthest South (88°23'S) on [...] Seven days later, about [...] from their goal, Amundsen's black flag was spotted {{and the party}} knew {{that they had been}} forestalled. They reached the Pole the next day, [...] 1912: [...] "The Pole. Yes, but under very different circumstances from those expected... Great God! This is an awful place and terrible enough for us to have laboured to it without the reward of priority. Well, it is something to have got here" [...] Scott still hoped to race Amundsen to the telegraph cablehead in Australia: [...] "Now for a desperate struggle to get the news through first. I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can do it." [...] However, on 18 January 1912 they discovered Amundsen's tent, some supplies, a letter to King HaakonVII of Norway (which Amundsen politely asked Scott to deliver) and a note stating that Amundsen had arrived there with four companions on [...] 1911.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2008, Minister for Transport Safety Harry Duynhoven pondered, [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> {{never had}} helmets what our cycle {{population}} might be... I'm not advocating {{getting rid of}} helmets, I'm just saying I wonder what the social effect of helmets has been." ...|$|E
2500|$|The rations were {{deficient}} in B and C vitamins. The party became weaker {{a few weeks}} after reaching the pole, despite Scott's racing ambitions before the return march, writing [...] "Now for a desperate struggle to get the news through first [...] I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can do it." ...|$|E

5000|$|Government prosecutors, in retrospect, have commented to the New York Times their misgivings of {{the charges}} and trial. [...] "I've always <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> (prosecutors) were the dupes," [...] one remarked.|$|R

2500|$|However, Thompson's {{opinion of}} the {{legislation}} changed and he conceded it had not worked as planned, saying [...] "I'm not prepared to go there yet, but I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> shouldn't just take off the limits and have full disclosure with harsh penalties for not reporting everything on the Internet immediately." [...] Thompson {{thought that it was}} right to do away with soft money, that it was right to raise the limits on hard money, but that the limitation on political speech within 30 or 60 days of an election was wrong and the spending limits by outside groups are not working and they both should be repealed.|$|E
2500|$|Little Inferno is {{the first}} game {{developed}} by Tomorrow Corporation, an independent game developer founded in 2010 consisting of three people: Kyle Gray, Kyle Gabler, and Allan Blomquist. Gray previously worked on Henry Hatsworth in the Puzzling Adventure, while Gabler and Blomquist worked on World of Goo. Gabler stated that Little Inferno was inspired by The Yule Log, a television program that consists of a 17-second loop of a burning log. The team had mused that the program was like [...] "a super boring game that some awful company will totally make for the Wii or smartphones," [...] which then inspired the proposal that [...] "WE could be that awful company! But I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> can start with an exceptionally underwhelming premise, but then actually make the game really really surprisingly good?" [...] One of the goals in designing Little Inferno {{was to make the}} game [...] "unpredictable" [...] in order to distinguish it from existing games in which the player might easily determine the direction of the gameplay. Gabler remarked [...] "I want to be taken on a ride, and not know where I'm going. I want game designers to respect me enough to NOT let me know exactly what's going on. Give me hints. Let me NOT know. Let me figure it out. Totally change the game out from under me." ...|$|E
6000|$|One night Marjorie {{had been}} sitting musing before the stove for a long time, and {{suddenly}} she said: [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> shall fail.

6000|$|... 'I {{thought my}} doings {{had ceased to}} {{interest}} you,' she said. 'I am Mr Blaythwayt's secretary, I have been here a fortnight. I have <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> should meet. I used to see you sometimes in the street.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Twelve moons," [...] {{she went}} on, [...] "and, Macumazahn, {{not one of}} them has gone by but I have thought of you several times and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> should ever meet again. Where have you been all this while?" ...|$|R

I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> dare----I have a friend, sort of {{a distant}} cousin, who married her a husband at Winklehurst, on the Palisades, not very far from the ferry. I <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> couldn't make her invite us both for dinner? Of course, she'll want to know all about you; but we'll be mysterious, and {{that will make it}} all the more fun, don't you think? I do want to prolong our jaunt, you see." ...|$|E
60|$|The morning came, {{and like}} one under the {{influence}} of some hideous nightmare I became aware that the savages were loosening the rawhide thongs. Faintly, with but little curiosity regarding the matter, I <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were to be killed at once, regardless of the usual customs of such wretches.|$|R
5000|$|... "Power and {{corruption}} {{have been part}} of our lives for decades, and less than three years after the revolution, I am still <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> made it. Back in 2007, when I began writing the script, I had one thought in mind: my main character Bastardo shouldn’t choose power. It’s rather power that chooses him and radically changes him." ...|$|R

5000|$|In 2011 Stephanie Buhmann {{described}} Kucka's work as {{inspired by}} nature, with an attention on geometry, inspired by 20th-century and contemporary abstraction.

60|$|I {{asked my}} cousin {{if she thought}} {{it could be a}} dream, and she replied that she was just about to ask me the same question; and then <b>we</b> both <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were both asleep, and if so, who was the real one that was dreaming, and who was the one that was only a dream; it got quite interesting.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a dismal}} night, coldish, {{with a thin}} rain falling; and as we trudged through the dark, silent fields, talking low to each other, and <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>we</b> were going right or not, we thought of the cosy boat, with the bright light {{streaming}} through the tight-drawn canvas; of Harris and Montmorency, and the whisky, and wished that we were there.|$|R

60|$|In the {{afternoon}} {{we took a}} walk, he and I, afterwards joined by the rest.

60|$|I {{remember}} that upon this particular morning I was troubling indirectly about Mariposilla, thinking that perhaps her daily association with Sidney {{might not be}} for the best.

60|$|As we {{lay down}} on the grass of the Campagna, next day, on our way to Florence, hearing the larks sing, we saw that a little wooden cross had been erected on the spot where the poor Pilgrim Countess was murdered.
