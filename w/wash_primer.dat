5|$|The mineral {{crocoite}} (lead chromate PbCrO4) {{was used}} as a yellow pigment shortly after its discovery. After a synthesis method became available starting from the more abundant chromite, chrome yellow was, together with cadmium yellow, one of the most used yellow pigments. The pigment does not photodegrade, but it tends to darken due to the formation of chromium(III) oxide. It has a strong color, and was used for school buses in the US and for Postal Service (for example Deutsche Post) in Europe. The use of chrome yellow declined due to environmental and safety concerns and was replaced by organic pigments or alternatives free from lead and chromium. Other pigments based on chromium are, for example, the bright red pigment chrome red, which is a basic lead chromate (PbCrO4·Pb(OH)2). A very important chromate pigment, which was used widely in metal primer formulations, was zinc chromate, now replaced by zinc phosphate. A <b>wash</b> <b>primer</b> was formulated to replace the dangerous practice of pretreating aluminium aircraft bodies with a phosphoric acid solution. This used zinc tetroxychromate dispersed in a solution of polyvinyl butyral. An 8% solution of phosphoric acid in solvent was added just before application. It was found that an easily oxidized alcohol was an essential ingredient. A thin layer of about 10–15µm was applied, which turned from yellow to dark green when it was cured. There is still a question as to the correct mechanism. Chrome green is a mixture of Prussian blue and chrome yellow, while the chrome oxide green is chromium(III) oxide.|$|E

40|$|Galvanized steel {{specimens}} were {{coated with}} four different organic systems, containing either special acrylic resins or epoxy resins {{with or without}} <b>wash</b> <b>primer.</b> The anticorrosive performance of these duplex systems when exposed to an environment of 3. 5 percent w/w NaCl solution, was investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, corrosion potential monitoring, potentiodynamic polarization and dielectric measurements. Interrelation of the obtained results, confined by visual observations after salt spray and weathering tests, shows that all four coating systems are more protective than simple galvanizing. The system, comprising a <b>wash</b> <b>primer,</b> a two-component epoxy resin primer and an epoxy resin finish paint, demonstrates the best anticorrosive behavior among the four systems examined...|$|E

40|$|In this study, an {{electroactive polymer}} (EAP), poly(2, 5 -bis(N-methyl-N- hexylamino) {{phenylene}} vinylene) (BAM-PPV), was tested {{as an alternative}} to current hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) -based Army <b>wash</b> <b>primers.</b> BAM-PPV was tested in both laboratory and field studies to determine its adhesive and corrosion-inhibiting properties when applied to steel and aluminum alloys. The Army Research Laboratory (ARL) tests showed that BAM-PPV combined with an epoxy primer and the Army chemical agent-resistant coating (CARC) topcoat met Army performance requirements for military coatings. After successful laboratory testing, the BAM-PPV was then field tested for one year at the Aberdeen Test Center (ATC). This field testing showed that BAM-PPV incorporated into the Army military coating survived with no delamination of the coating and only minor corrosion on the chip sites...|$|R
40|$|For the phylogenetic {{analysis}} of microbial communities present in environmental samples microbial DNA can be {{extracted from the}} sample, 16 S rDNA can be amplified with suitable primers and the PCR, and clonal libraries can be constructed. We report a protocol {{that can be used}} for efficient cell lysis and recovery of DNA from marine sediments. Key steps in this procedure include the use of a bead mill homogenizer for matrix disruption and uniform cell lysis and then purification of the released DNA by agarose gel electrophoresis. For sediments collected from two sites in Puget Sound, over 96 % of the cells present were lysed. Our method yields high-molecular-weight DNA that is suitable for molecular studies, including amplification of 16 S rRNA genes. The DNA yield was 47 micrograms per g (dry weight) for sediments collected from creosote-contaminated Eagle Harbor, <b>Wash.</b> <b>Primers</b> were selected for the PCR amplification of (eu) bacterial 16 S rDNA that contained linkers with unique 8 -base restriction sites for directional cloning. Examination of 22 16 S rDNA clones showed that the surficial sediments in Eagle Harbor contained a phylogenetically diverse population of organisms from the Bacteria domain (G. J. Olsen, C. R. Woese, and R. Overbeek, J. Bacteriol. 176 : 1 - 6, 1994) with members of six major lineages represented: alpha, delta, and gamma Proteobacteria; the gram-positive high G+C content subdivision; clostridia and related organisms; and planctomyces and related organisms.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the performance of thermal-sprayed coating of Zn/Al (double layer) after six years of exposure, with and without the use of sealant (<b>wash</b> <b>primer)</b> in tropical marine environments of very high aggressiveness: La Voz Station (located at the Peninsula de Paraguaná/Falcón State) and Lake Maracaibo Crossing Station (located at Zulia State), in Venezuela. To that effect, carbon steel coupons (100 [*]mm × 150 [*]mm × 2 [*]mm) were sprayed by flame process. The coupons were characterized by means of initial weight, thickness, metallographic, adherence, and roughness, being evaluated monthly by visual inspection during six years. After removal, the coupons were evaluated by microscopic analysis to determine the morphology of attack, microstructure, penetration of contaminants, composition, and morphology of corrosion products. The results showed that after six years, the double-layer system represents an excellent choice for corrosion protection of steel by combining the galvanic protection of zinc with the erosion resistance of aluminum. However, due to the erosion-corrosion effect, a sealant such as <b>wash</b> <b>primer</b> can be used in order to extend its service life...|$|E

40|$|Recently, a {{technique}} was described for amplification of Rhodococcus equi-specific chromosomal and vapA DNA from blood and tracheal wash fluids. It {{was hypothesized that}} this technique would be more sensitive than standard culture techniques or serology for diagnosis of R. equi pneumonia in foals. Tracheal wash fluid, nasal swabs, whole blood samples, and serum samples from 56 foals with pneumonia were analyzed. Final clinical diagnosis {{was determined by the}} attending clinician on the basis of final interpretation of all available information about each foal, including clinical presentation, diagnostic test results, response to therapy, and outcome. Clinical diagnosis was used as a final reference standard for calculation of sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values for PCR, serology using an agar gel immunodiffusion test, and tracheal wash fluid culture. PCR of tracheal <b>wash</b> fluid using <b>primers</b> that recognized the vapA virulence plasmid of R. equi had a diagnostic sensitivity of 100 % and specificity of 90. 6 %. Sensitivity and specificity were 57. 1 and 93. 8 %, respectively, for standard microbiologic culture of tracheal wash fluid and 62. 5 and 75. 9 %, respectively, for serology.

40|$|A {{zinc layer}} on a steel surface {{combined}} with on organic coating (duplex system) offers highly effective protection against corrosion. The zinc layer prevents the oxidation of the steel by being sacrificed onodicolly. The additional system of paints prevents the penetration of humidity and the general contamination of the galvanised surface during exposure to intensely corrosive atmospheres. In this work galvanised steel specimens were coated with the following four different systems of organic coatings: System 1 (two layers) : <b>Wash</b> <b>Primer</b> + Coal tar epoxy; System 2 (one layer) : Coal tar epoxy; System 3 (three layers) : <b>Wash</b> <b>Primer</b> + Zinc rich epoxy + epoxy paint; System 4 (two layers) : Zinc rich epoxy + epoxy point. The corrosion behaviour of these specimens in 3. 5 % w/w NaCl was investigated by Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS), monitoring of the corrosion potential, potentiodynamic polarization measurements and dielectric measurements. Also, their behaviour in a salt spray chamber was monitored. Uncooted specimens of galvanised steel were used as reference specimens. Results of EIS and dielectric measurements were fitted to advanced models for the prediction {{of the changes in}} the parameters that characterise the anticorrosive behaviour of the organic coatings. Interrelation of the obtained results shows that the four coating systems offer more protection than simple galvanising. Systems 1 ond 2 demonstrate better anticorrosive behaviour than systems 3 and 4...|$|E

The current metal coating process is a multi-step process. The surface is cleaned, primered, dried and then painted. The process is labor intensive and time consuming. The <b>wash</b> <b>primer</b> is a conversion coating, which prepares metal surface for better paint adhesion. The wash primers currently used often contain hexavalent chromium (Cr 6 +), which seals the pores in the conversion coating. The presence of hexavalent chromium, a known carcinogen, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) make waste disposal expensive and pose dangers to workers. The novel technique of in-situ phosphatizing coating (ISPC) is a single-step, chrome-free alternative to the present coating practice. Formulation of an ISPC involves predispersal of an in-situ phosphatizing reagent (ISPR) into the paint system to form a stable formulation. The ISPR reacts with the metal surface and bonds with the paint film simultaneously, which eliminates the need for a conversion coating. In acid catalyzed paint systems, such as polyester-melamine paints, the ISPR also catalyzes cross-linking reactions between the melamine and the polyester polyols. ISPCs are formulated using commercially available coating systems including: polyester-melamine, two-component epoxy, polyurethane and high-hydroxy content polyester-melamine coil coating. The ISPCs are applied to metal substrates and their performances are evaluated using electrochemical, thermal and standard American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) testing methods. In addition, ISPCs were designed and formulated based on: (1) phosphate chemistry, (2) polymer chemistry, (3) sol-gel chemistry, and (4) the ion-exchange principle. Organo-functionalized silanes, which serve as excellent coupling and dispersion agents, are incorporated into the optimized ISPC formula and evaluated using standard ASTM testing methods and electrochemical spectroscopy. Also, an ion-exchange pigment, which leads to better adhesion by forming a mixed metal silicate surface, is dispersed into an ISPC and the performance of the final coating formulation is evaluated. Successful ISPCs formulated for multiple coating systems exhibited excellent adhesion, hardness and gloss, which supports their suitability as a chrome-free, single-step alternative for aerospace, original equipment manufacturing (OEM) and coil coating applications...|$|E
