5|$|He {{is always}} there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. When the boys rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity <b>within</b> <b>moments</b> of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E

During the session, where teams assessed their car's thermal management {{in preparation for the}} race, Bird and Piquet locked their tyres and went off into the turn one run-off area, while Abt stopped on the start/finish straight but was able to restart his car. Duval and Frijns spun <b>within</b> <b>moments</b> of each other.

Members of 10th Mountain Division’s 1-32 Infantry Regiment were air lifted to the nearest helicopter landing zone on OP Fritsche and arrived at approximately 1400 hrs, as recalled by a soldier on scene. After assisting with securing the OP from potential follow on attacks, members of the Quick Reaction Force descended from the mountain’s peak to COP Keating on foot. While in route the Platoon encountered a planned ambush on the side of the mountain resulting in three confirmed enemy KIA at approximately 1800 hrs.

25|$|In a November {{afternoon}} of 1999, Cárdenas {{learned that a}} Gulf Cartel informant was being transported through Matamoros, Tamaulipas, by the FBI and DEA. According to the story mentioned in the interviews 11 years after this life-or-death incident, the DEA agent Joe DuBois and FBI agent Daniel Fuentes were riding in a white Ford Bronco with diplomatic plates along the streets of Matamoros, Tamaulipas. For years, both were working for the disarticulation of the cartels in Mexico, and both knew how the drug cartels worked south of the border. In {{the back seat of}} the car, a Mexican informant from a local newspaper on crime coverage guided the two agents and gave them a tour on the city's drug routes and on the homes of the drug lords of the city.

To examine what is sacred in our world today it is necessary to understand that advancements in science and technology have changed our attitude toward spirituality.

500|$|Another {{well-documented}} gunfight {{resulted in}} the most kills by one person in a single event, when Capt. Jonathan R. Davis shot eleven bandits single-handedly on 19 December 1854. Unknown to Davis and his companions, a band of robbers was lying in wait in the canyon brush near the trail. They were a typically diverse and motley group of Gold Rush bandits: two Americans, one Frenchman, two Britons, five Sydney Ducks, and four Mexicans. As Captain Davis and his companions trudged on foot, the bandit gang charged out of the brush, pistols flaming. James McDonald died instantly, without time to draw his revolver or react in any way. Dr. Bolivar managed to get his six-shooter out and fire twice at the highwaymen before he dropped, badly wounded. Captain Davis later described himself as being [...] "in a fever of excitement at the time." [...] Unfazed, he stood his ground, pulling out both pistols and firing a barrage at the charging outlaws. He shot down his assailants, one after another. The outlaws' bullets tore at Davis's clothing, but caused only two slight flesh wounds. <b>Within</b> <b>moments,</b> seven of the bandits were dead or dying {{on the ground and}} Davis's pistols were empty. Four of the remaining robbers now closed in on the captain to finish him off. Davis whipped out his Bowie knife, and quickly warded off the thrusts from the two of the bandits. He stabbed one of them to death; the other he disarmed by knocking the knife from his grasp and slicing off his nose and a finger of his right hand. The two last attackers were the men who had been wounded in a previous bandit raid. Despite their weakened condition, they foolishly approached Davis with drawn knives. The captain reacted in an instant. Slashing with his heavy Bowie, he killed them both.|$|E

Tired of her outburst, Lois tries to tell Meg that she is simply taking her own problems out on everyone else, but Meg brings up Lois's past and tells her that she is [...] "the furthest thing from" [...] the perfect mother. Meg also informs Lois that when she turns eighteen, she is considering never seeing her again. Lois is reduced to tears and profusely apologizes to Meg. Meg then confronts Peter who, unable to comprehend her insults, thinks that his daughter's argument is amusing until she calls him a [...] "waste of a man." [...] <b>Within</b> <b>moments,</b> Peter, Lois and Chris turn their abusive criticisms on each other. Peter then runs away to his room crying, leaving Meg and Brian to discuss what just happened.

40|$|This psychophysiological {{study is}} the first to examine the {{relationship}} between emotional tears and emotional piloerection (i. e., goosebumps). Although both phenomena have been related to peak states of being moved, details about their temporal occurrence and the associated levels of physiological arousal have remained unknown. In our study, we used emotionally powerful film scenes that were self-selected by participants. Our findings show that even <b>within</b> peak <b>moments</b> of emotional arousal, a gradation of intensity is possible. The overlap of tears and goosebumps signifies a maximal climax <b>within</b> peak <b>moments.</b> On the side of the stimulus, we found that displays of prosocial behavior play a crucial role in the elicitation of tears and goosebumps. Finally, based on the results of a formal film analysis of the tears-eliciting clips provided by our participants, as compared to randomly extracted, equally long control clips from the same films, we show how the technical and artistic making of the clips was optimized for the display of social interaction and emotional expressions...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} {{evidence}} for the very brief, temporal quantization of perceptual experience at regular intervals below 100 ms for several decades.

More recently, a link with physiological mechanisms has been proposed, according to which the 50 – 60 ms psychological moment would be defined by the upper limit required by neural mechanisms to synchronize and thereby represent a snapshot of current perceptual event structure. However, our own experimental developments also identify a more fine-scaled, serialized process structure <b>within</b> the psychological <b>moment.</b> Our data suggests that not all events are processed as co-temporal <b>within</b> the psychological <b>moment</b> and instead, some are processed successively. This evidence questions the analog relationship between synchronized process and simultaneous experience and opens debate on the ontology and function of ‘moments’ in psychological experience...|$|R
