500|$|Dan Adams of IGN {{rated the}} game 9.4 out of 10 and praised its {{improved}} visuals and expansive environments, but cited the short six-hour length as a drawback. He said: [...] "Any <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, Episode Two stands out, {{even among the}} Half-Life series, as something special ... a burly experience packed into roughly six hours or so that offers up all the diversity, level design, and thoughtful gameplay we've known while making sure to propel the story forward and leave us wanting more." [...] Bit-tech.net awarded the game a 10 out of 10 score, citing approval of how the story turns {{and the introduction of}} side stories and new characters. 1UP.com praised the game, noting that the game's [...] "entire five-hour experience" [...] was [...] "vivid, emotionally engaging, and virtually unsurpassed." [...] PC Gamer UK also applauded Episode Two, noting it [...] "is the most sumptuous chapter of the Half-Life saga, and by a country mile." [...] The New York Times enjoyed the gameplay, saying, [...] "The battles in Episode 2 of Half-Life 2 often require as much ingenuity as they do fast reflexes." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to the father-son {{dynamics}} of the hunting world depicted in the series' first season with the Winchesters, the writers decided to explore a mother-daughter relationship. This resulted in {{the introduction of the}} character Jo Harvelle and her mother Ellen, though the Alex character was eventually renamed Jo. Tal had been a fan of the show, and decided to audition for the role. Since the character was not fully explored during her first few appearances on the show, Tal did not know what her personality would be. Because of the way Jo is introducedthreatening Dean with a rifleTal {{was under the impression that}} the character was an experienced hunter. With this in mind, she decided to portray her as [...] "somewhat confident and cool" [...] by making use of her experience in the Israeli army, where she served for two years. Tal commented, [...] "When I was in the army I was holding my gun and feeling all dangerous and badass. It's an attitude, it's a different kind of walk, and the way you hold yourself, the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> things. I tried to put that in there because she didn't say much." ...|$|E
500|$|Both Anupama Chopra of NDTV and Pavithra Srinivasan of Rediff.com gave Enthiran {{a rating}} of {{three and a half}} out of five stars. Chopra criticised the film's {{portions}} in the second half, describing them as [...] "needlessly stretched and cacophonous", but concluded her review by saying, [...] "Robot rides on Rajinikanth's shoulders and he never stoops under the burden. Aided by snazzy clothes, make-up and special effects, he makes Chitti endearing." [...] Srinivasan, however, said that Shankar [...] "strikes the balance between science fiction and masala quotient." [...] She concluded that, [...] "Whichever <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, [...] is one of those rare films that give you just enough material to pull you in, and enjoy yourself." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-News18 gave {{a rating of}} three out of five stars and said, [...] "In the end, it's the fantastic special effects and an inspired performance from [...] that keeps the film fresh." [...] Mayank Shekhar, writing for Hindustan Times, rated it three stars and said, [...] "Leave aside jokes running on the Internet. This film, just a few feet too long, is fine entertainment by itself." ...|$|E

2500|$|He {{is remembered}} {{as both a}} genius and a [...] [...] One of his {{favorite}} insults was to refer to people he did not approve of as [...] "spherical bastards", because, he explained, they were bastards no matter which <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> them.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{impossible}} to say," [...] replied Mr. George. [...] "It was such a complicated case {{that you could not}} decide it either way. The question was like a piece of changeable silk. You could make it look green or brown, just according to the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it. When <b>you</b> come to read the history you will see just how it was." ...|$|R
2500|$|Crime la Elsinore is {{a return}} to prose satire, in this case {{directed}} at the theatrical environment. The setting is a fictional theater in provincial Călăraşi, deriving its name from the Getic ruler Dromichaetes, and the protagonists, Cosmin Ciotloş notes, are composite portrayals rather than the [...] "masked" [...] characters of Căderea Bastiliei. He argues: [...] "Whichever <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, set free from the contextual interpretations exercised in reading tabloids, the novel stands only to gain." [...] The narrative focus is on the kitschy ambition of a failed theater manager, Cosma, who proceeds to conflate all the violent moments of Shakespearean tragedy into a single show of regular proportions. The project is increasingly confused, and the text used by Cosma mixes Shakespeare's lines with quotes from Pierre Beaumarchais, Euripides and Molière, while adopting the format of a detective novel.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Suppose {{he were to}} snap!' he thought. Impelled {{to justify}} this fancy, he blurted out: [...] "You're a nervous chap. The <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> those poor devils!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} wouldn't," [...] said Jack, coolly reopening {{the rail and}} {{stepping}} back again. [...] "It all depends upon the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> those things. Good-night." ...|$|E

60|$|I shall try {{to write}} simply and to tell here how Ernest Everhard entered my life--how I first met him, how he grew until I {{became a part of}} him, and the {{tremendous}} changes he wrought in my life.

6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} lose you, any <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, and--and--oh, can't you see that I love you?" [...] he blurted out, despite all his good intentions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Margie, it was rotten of Daren, one <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it--our way," [...] added Flossie. [...] "But {{you have}} {{to hand it to}} him for that stunt." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] he {{retorted}} coolly, [...] "if that's the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it! But if you're not in {{a desperate}} hurry, I'll take off my jacket." ...|$|E
5000|$|After Trump won the Republican nomination, Priebus went on {{to forge}} a {{positive}} relationship with Trump and was personally involved in quashing efforts by anti-Trump delegates to prevent Trump's nomination. On October 4, 2016, Priebus called Trump a role model. [...] "You know, I think everyone's a role model in different <b>ways.</b> When <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> someone who has built businesses, lost businesses, came back, lived the American dream, a person who sets goals, he's a winner." ...|$|R
50|$|I {{wanted to}} capture {{the spirit of the}} Ealing comedies and British films of the ‘50s and ‘60s that were clearly aimed at {{children}} and delivered action and fun in a largely cartoonish <b>way.</b> If <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the basic premise of the plot, the crooks clearly want to or intend to kill the children at some point, so how do you disguise that and make that palatable to an audience of kids and parents? You make the crooks buffoonish, the gang that couldn’t shoot straight, so that takes the curse off the underlying purpose.|$|R
5000|$|Hensher notes {{too that}} [...] "Its a very God-free heaven, with no {{suggestion}} that anyone has been judged, or found wanting," [...] Philip Hensher stated in The Observer. However, Sebold {{has stated that}} the book {{is not intended to}} be religious, [...] "but if people want to take things and interpret them, then I cant do anything about that. It is a book that has faith and hope and giant universal themes in it, but its not meant to be, This is the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> should <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the afterlife".|$|R
6000|$|... "Won't {{you explain}} to me the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it? These people don't all seem to be dishonest men or charlatans. Some of them, I know, are honest." [...] And her colour rose again.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I had him he's {{weak and}} hungry, {{and the high}} places are feet deep in drifts. It doesn't signify. I'm corralled any <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, {{and the only thing}} left is to fight." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{sight of}} her grief seemed to kindle her father's wrath to a flame. [...] "Any <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> him, he's been a dumn blackguard; that's what he's been. You're a million times too good for him; and I--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Cathleys {{are another}} {{so-called}} revolutionary family," [...] Jocelyn Thew explained. [...] "The late Sir Denis, {{the father of}} the man whom he supposed me to be, was Michael Dilwyn's closest friend. They, too, have paid a heavy price for their patriotism or their rebellious instincts, whichever <b>way</b> <b>you</b> choose to <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the matter." ...|$|R
5000|$|According to MTV News, most of Usher's {{lyrics to}} [...] "Ride" [...] differ from Lopez's [...] "Get Right". In one verse, he sings: [...] "It's the <b>way</b> that <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me, piques my curiosity". [...] "I'm {{wondering}} what you're feeling tonight/ We never chilled, we never spent no time/ So let's take a minute/ ... Show you what I'm feeling inside/ Baby, hold on, tonight we're gonna ride." [...] As [...] "Ride" [...] had been circulating online for months, following {{the release of}} [...] "Get Right", club DJs began playing the songs back-to-back, [...] "letting listeners hear two big-name singers going head-to-head over the same beat".|$|R
2500|$|So serial {{thinking}} is something that's {{come into our}} consciousness and will be there forever: it's relativity and nothing else. It just says: Use all the components of any given number of elements, don't leave out individual elements, use them all with equal importance {{and try to find}} an equidistant scale so that certain steps are no larger than others. It's a spiritual and democratic attitude toward the world. The stars are organized in a serial <b>way.</b> Whenever <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a certain star sign you find a limited number of elements with different intervals. If we more thoroughly studied the distances and proportions of the stars we'd probably find certain relationships of multiples based on some logarithmic scale or whatever the scale may be.|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, {{if that is}} the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, sir, I {{am willing}} to do all I can; and if we find there is any of our mates alive we will get them out if it is possible, never fear.” ...|$|E
6000|$|The horn {{returned}} to the table quietly, and young Howard {{was the first to}} speak. [...] "That is a fine piece of ventriloquism, any <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it," [...] said he. [...] "It is a nice trick to give that peculiar tinny sound to a whisper." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{depends upon}} the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> these things," [...] the young man replied gloomily. [...] "Katharine tells me that she is watched at her hotel day and night, and that she has come under the {{suspicion}} of the Government for being concerned in this affair." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "I {{have already}} {{described}} {{the way in}} which the city is walled, but they say that it was divided up into narrow streets in the same irregular manner as in Athens, and that the houses were built in such a <b>way</b> that if <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> them from outside they had only one story, while if you went into one of them, you at once found subterranean chambers extending as far below the level of the earth as did the chambers above." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, come, gentlemen, I say; this isn't business," [...] said Marks. [...] "There's {{different}} <b>ways,</b> <b>you</b> know, of <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> all subjects. Mr. Haley is a {{very nice}} man, no doubt, and has his own conscience; and, Tom, <b>you</b> have your <b>ways,</b> and very good ones, too, Tom; but quarrelling, you know, won't answer no kind of purpose. Let's go to business. Now, Mr. Haley, what is it?--you want us to undertake to catch this yer gal?" ...|$|R
60|$|For {{all these}} reasons, then, any <b>way</b> <b>you</b> may <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it, <b>you</b> must needs {{conclude}} that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like. And the only mode {{in which you can}} derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is by going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, {{it seems to me you}} had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this Leviathan.|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed!" [...] she exclaimed, [...] "is {{that the}} <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it? Well, I {{can assure you}} that what I have to tell is of no {{importance}} at all, but if you have anything to say that is mangling, I want to hear it this very minute." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Longueville," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "where in {{the world}} did you drop from, and {{how long did it take}} you to cross the Atlantic? Three days, eh? It could n't have taken you many more, for it was only the other day that Gordon told me you were not to sail till the 20th. You changed your mind, eh? I did n't know you ever changed your mind. Gordon never changes his. That 's not a reason, eh, because you are not a bit like Gordon. Well, I never thought you were, except that you are a man. Now what are you {{laughing}} at? What should you like me call you? You are a man, I suppose; you are not a god. That 's what you would like me to call you, I have no doubt. I must keep that for Gordon? I shall certainly keep it a good while. I know a good deal more about gentlemen than I did when I last saw you, and I assure you I don't think they are a bit god-like. I suppose that 's why you always drop down from the sky--you think it 's more divine. I remember that 's the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> arrived at Baden when we were there together; the first thing we knew, you were standing in the midst of us. Do you remember that evening when you presented yourself? You came up and touched Gordon on the shoulder, and he gave a little jump. He will give another little jump when he sees you to-day. He gives a great many little jumps; I keep him skipping about! I remember perfectly the way we were sitting that evening at Baden, and the <b>way</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me when <b>you</b> came up. I saw you before Gordon--I see a good many things before Gordon. What did <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me that <b>way</b> for? I always meant to ask you. I was dying to know." ...|$|R

60|$|Perhaps {{it will be}} best, now the eye {{has been}} fixed upon, to discuss the {{question}} of the hair. The professor opens his book of patterns. Maybe the lady is of a wilful disposition. She loves to run laughing through the woods during exceptionally rainy weather; or to gallop across the downs without a hat, her fair ringlets streaming in the wind, the old family coachman panting and expostulating in the rear. If one may trust the popular novel, extremely satisfactory husbands have often been secured in this <b>way.</b> <b>You</b> naturally <b>look</b> <b>at</b> a girl who is walking through a wood, laughing heartily apparently {{for no other reason than}} because it is raining--who rides at stretch gallop without a hat. If you have nothing else to do, you follow her. It is always on the cards that such a girl may do something really amusing before she gets home. Thus things begin.|$|R
