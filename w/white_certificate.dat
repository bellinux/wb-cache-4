So far, stylized facts are lacking and outcomes are mainly country-specific.

In this respect, we {{support the view that}} <b>white</b> <b>certificates</b> schemes are a policy instrument of multi-functional nature (subsidisation, information, technology diffusion), whose static and dynamic efficiency depends upon the consistency between a proper definition of long-term energy savings, the appropriate cost-recovery permission and a fine coordination with other instruments.

The paper analyses, from a comparative perspective, Italy’s commitment to EU energy policies focused on creating a competitive internal energy market offering quality service at low prices, developing renewable energy sources, reducing dependence on imported fuels and implementing energy efficiency tools, safeguarding the environment. The strengths and limits of the Italian <b>White</b> <b>Certificates</b> mechanism will be examined, considering its i portance as a market-based tool in national energy policy.

The paper provides an up-to-date review and analysis of results to date of <b>white</b> <b>certificate</b> schemes in the EU. In the EU supplier obligations and <b>white</b> <b>certificate</b> schemes have delivered larger savings than originally expected with obliged companies exceeding targets and, in some cases, at cost below what policy makers have anticipated. Supplier obligations foster the uptake of standardised energy efficiency actions often targeting smaller energy users (residential sector), lowering the transaction costs and contributing to market transformation. The role of certificate trading is more ambiguous. Trading can bring benefits where the target is set sufficiently high {{with respect to the}} energy saving potential in the sectors covered. Theoretically trading may be better suited for broader systems with comprehensive coverage, but even in smaller schemes trading may reduce the transaction costs of compliance for obliged actors without sufficient expertise on end-use energy efficiency. Yet, trading increases the administrative cost ratio of energy saving obligations. JRC. DG. F. 8 -Renewable Energy (Ispra...|$|E

40|$|<b>White</b> <b>Certificate</b> schemes are {{currently}} being implemented or proposed in {{a growing number of}} jurisdictions as a means to drive greater energy efficiency uptake. After briefly discussing some of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} such schemes, this paper outlines a proposed alternative approach [...] the use of Energy Sales Targets. This approach essentially involves the imposition of a cap on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with annual energy sales and, in its simplest version, requires no tradeable certificates or permits. The proposed approach creates a clear measurable link between how compliance is enforced (the retailers' targets) and the desired outcomes of the scheme (measurable reductions in GHG emissions). This drives physical additionality of the scheme, including negation of any rebound effect within the covered sectors. It also avoids the need to define the activities eligible to create certificates, and likewise, no deeming, auditing, monitoring or verification would be required by government beyond ensuring retailer compliance [...] significantly reducing administration costs. There does not appear to be a clear precedent for this type of scheme anywhere in the world, and so this paper should be seen as a preliminary scoping of options that are deserving of more in-depth assessment.

40|$|Recent {{years have}} {{witnessed}} regained political momentum on {{energy efficiency and}} interest in establishing markets is growing. As a result, Tradable <b>White</b> <b>Certificate</b> (TWC) schemes of differing design have been implemented in Great Britain, Italy and France. Much attention is being paid to justifying and evaluating such schemes. In this paper, we develop and apply a multi-criteria framework for evaluating TWC schemes [...] an approach that attempts to cover their individual design features. A broad evaluation is conducted regarding energy-saving and environmental effectiveness, economic efficiency, cost-effectiveness, transaction costs, political feasibility, administrative burden and technical change. The results show the design and performance of TWC schemes to be case and context-specific, and generalisations are thus inappropriate. This evaluation supports the cost-effectiveness modelled for the British scheme and the assumption that a TWC scheme is an economically efficient policy instrument. For the other, more complex TWC schemes, more data and experience are needed to judge their ex-post merit. On the whole, the proposed multi-criteria evaluation requires considerable data and complementary methods. However, the framework improves {{the understanding of the}} broad effects and attributes of TWC schemes.

'Negawatt-hour cost' estimates reach 0. 009 /kWh saved in Great Britain and 0. 037 /kWh saved in France, which compares favourably to energy prices in those countries. Moreover, the benefits of reduced energy bills and CO  2  emissions saved exceed the costs; thus, <b>white</b> <b>certificate</b> schemes pay for themselves. Overall, the policy instrument is cost-effective and economically efficient. A closer look at the differences amongst countries provides general insights about the conceptualization of the instrument: (a) Compared to utility demand-side management, to which they are related, <b>white</b> <b>certificate</b> schemes provide more transparency about energy savings, but less transparency around costs; (b) the substantial efficiency discrepancy between the British scheme and its French counterpart can be explained by differences in technological potentials, coexisting policies and supply-side systems in these countries and (c) the nature and amount of costs influence compliance strategies.

We narrow the discussion to analysis of currently applied emissions trading schemes, notably the EU Emissions Trading System and provide our observations related to this question. Market-based instruments (MBIs) that foster sustainability in the energy sector have been introduced to promote electricity from renewable energy sources and cut harmful emissions.

40|$|Abstract: Over {{the last}} few decades, several {{instruments}} have evolved to deal with similar energy and environmental challenges. For instance, the economic literature prescribes separate tax or cap-and-trade systems to internalize negative environmental externalities and subsidies to internalize positive externalities such as R&D. However, policy is not straightforward because of the influence on cost and competition and concerns for regional employment, economic activity within certain industries, and any distributional effects. Tax discrimination, subsidies and regulations then undermine the efficiency of energy instruments. To balance any environmental concerns, other instruments, including green and <b>white</b> <b>certificates,</b> have been created. While innovative, these work as simple combinations of taxes and subsidies. While the extant literature thoroughly analyzes the partial effects of these instruments, {{there has been little}} focus on their basics and the effects of aggregate taxes and subsidies.
