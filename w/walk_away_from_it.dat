500|$|Quesada sees Peter's {{making a}} [...] "deal with the Devil" [...] as a villain (Mephisto) taking {{advantage}} of someone at his weakest moment. This, he feels, is a better resolution than Peter and Mary Jane getting divorced, which would indicate [...] "they gave up on their love, that their life in love together was so awful, so stressful, so unfulfilling {{that they had to}} raise a red flag and <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>it.</b> They quit on their marriage and even more tragic, (they) quit on each other. Instead, we had them make a deal with the devil. [...] 'Cause that isn't as bad." [...] Quesada went on to say, [...] "Peter and MJ didn't quit on their love, they sacrificed it to save a life, that to me is a pretty heroic story." ...|$|E
500|$|Adams {{works closely}} with her acting coach Warner Loughlin, and credits Loughlin for helping her {{organize}} and structure her thoughts. She uses an acting method taught by Loughlin, in which she attempts an understanding of her character's psychology by creating the character's back-story {{from the age of}} three. Adams prefers to work with confident directors who give her space to think for herself. She stays in character while filming, and finds it difficult to detach herself from roles and accents. She is not influenced by the size of a role and is drawn towards both leading and supporting parts. Describing herself as an obsessive performer, Adams has said, [...] "I'm never satisfied with the take. I'll <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>it,</b> but I could go and go and go. I've had to learn to be OK with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Giancarlo Esposito {{said that}} when he first read the script for [...] "Box Cutter", he was so shocked that he had to put it down and <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>it.</b> Esposito said {{he did not want to}} [...] "take any of [...] home with me" [...] and had [...] "some deep concern about being able to do it and coming out of it unscathed, without really hurting my spirit and my soul". He worked through these {{concerns}} by justifying Gus' actions in that, by killing Victor, he was protecting everyone else who works for him. Nevertheless, he said it was [...] "a difficult moment for me" [...] to slit Victor's throat, and that during one take he tried to hush the character to make him die more calmly. That scene took two days to film, and Esposito remained silent and focused during filming, rarely speaking to the others on set. The boots he was originally given were too large and he was concerned that he would slip, which would be out of character for Gus, who was otherwise completely calm and in control. A costume designer quickly procured the right-sized boots for him.|$|E

500|$|Q {{magazine}} {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars, stating [...] "It speaks volumes for Pearl Jam's continuing creative acumen that they can respond so confidently to a new punk scene that has sprung up." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice gave the album an A- rating, writing that [...] "Three or four of these songs are faster and riffier than anything else in P. Jam's book, token experiments like [...] "Bugs" [...] are genuinely weird, and in an era of compulsory irony [...] sincerity is something like a relief—a Kurtlike relief at that." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+. He said, [...] "Vitalogy marks the first time it's possible to respect the band's music as much as its stance." [...] He added that [...] "despite its musical advances, Vitalogy leaves an odd, unsettling aftertaste. You <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>it</b> energized, but wondering what price Eddie Vedder, and Pearl Jam, will ultimately pay for it." [...] Chicago Sun-Times writer Jim DeRogatis gave it three out of four stars and commended Pearl Jam for their earnest songwriting. However, DeRogatis also wrote that the album [...] "leaves you wishing that they'd just lighten up". USA Todays Edna Gundersen gave Vitalogy three and a half out of four stars and stated that it [...] "delivers the band's most compelling, inventive and confident music to date", while calling it [...] "the rebel yell of a band that is maturing without mellowing". Los Angeles Times critic Robert Hilburn gave Vitalogy four out of four stars and viewed its music as an improvement over Pearl Jam's previous work, writing [...] "This isn't just the best Pearl Jam album but a better album than the band once even seemed capable of making". AllMusic staff writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album four and a half out of five stars, saying, [...] "Pearl Jam are at their best when they're fighting, whether it's Ticketmaster, fame, or their own personal demons." [...] According to The New Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), [...] "By Vitalogy PJ hit their apex … the band's creative zenith, finding them doing a Led Zeppelin III on acoustic tracks like 'Corduroy' and turning in a Tom Waits-like weird attack on 'Bugs'".|$|E

2500|$|Speaking {{about the}} album with the Chicago Sun-Times, Fiasco has stated: [...] "Lasers {{is a great}} album. I'm {{actually}} happy with the record. I feel I got to say what I wanted even with -- It doesn't make up for {{what it took to}} get through it. It's still being argued and debated upon. ... The climate of this record was very weird, in some instances surreal. I became very abstract. I had to create this commercial art that appeases the corporate side. I had to acquiesce to certain forces. Hopefully within that I snuck in some things I actually wanted to say any way I can." [...] In an interview with The Guardian, Fiasco has expressed that during the recording process of the album he has dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts: [...] "It was mentally destructive. I say it with a certain laissez-faire now because I'm past it [...] I was super-depressed, lightly suicidal, at moments medium suicidal – and if not suicidal, willing to just <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>it</b> all completely." ...|$|E

In his early twenties, he visited North Dakota to participate in a Native American Sun Dance, during which he had a spiritual epiphany that inspired him to reexamine his Jewish roots.|$|R
