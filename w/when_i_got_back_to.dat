2500|$|After {{a highly}} publicized premiere in Los Angeles and a gala fundraiser in Miami, the White House hosted a private {{screening}} of So Ends Our Night for President Franklin Roosevelt, who admired the film greatly. [...] The starstruck youngster was invited to Roosevelt's annual Birthday Ball. [...] He returned to Los Angeles and promptly registered as a Democrat, a fervent FDR supporter. [...] "I was so impressed when I met Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt," [...] recalled Glenn Ford to his son decades later, [...] "I was thrilled <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Los Angeles and found a beautiful photograph personally autographed to me. It always held a place of high honor in my home." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. Yes. I {{missed it}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Claridge’s, and I thought I might {{possibly}} have dropped it here.|$|E
60|$|The {{first thing}} I saw <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the ship was}} Ransome on the quarter-deck sitting quietly on his neatly lashed sea-chest.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> the {{argument}} had just concluded, {{and the lady}} was holding up her finger.|$|R
6000|$|... "Just now. Only a {{few minutes}} ago. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> was driving him to his hotel. He {{had asked me to}} marry him before I left for England, and I had promised to give him his answer <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back.</b> But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back,</b> somehow <b>I</b> couldn't make up my mind. The days slipped by. Something seemed to be holding me back. He pressed me to say that I would marry him, and it seemed absurd to go on refusing to be definite, so I said I would." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Once; {{while we}} were at Baltimore. But Lowell caught me, and the captain nearly killed me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back.</b> <b>I</b> could have <b>got</b> away, only <b>I</b> had no money." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my room I {{locked the}} door behind me, {{and went to sleep}} in the dark. I did not want light just then--could not bear it.|$|E
60|$|And {{that evening}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the club and}} talked about it at dinner to my {{business}} friends, I found that I had only heard {{a small part of}} it.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the cave}} Bill {{and the boy}} {{were not to be}} found. I {{explored}} the vicinity of the cave, and risked a yodel or two, but there was no response.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] {{she asked}} coolly. [...] "I {{have been in}} it for years, you know, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> from South Africa {{everything}} seemed so terribly slow that I begged for some work to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have not," [...] Pamela replied, [...] "but {{the only}} reason {{seems to be that}} I have nothing worth stealing. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> from luncheon this {{afternoon}} I found that my stateroom had been systematically searched." ...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was past}} five {{o'clock in the}} {{afternoon}} before I returned from the performance of these duties. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> Anne Catherick was dead. Dead on the 25th, and Lady Glyde was not to arrive in London till the 26th! ...|$|R
60|$|Disappointed, again, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Boston; for I was {{promising}} myself half an hour's look at you, in Belmont; {{but your}} note to Osgood showed {{that that could}} not be allowed out yet.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the house}} I {{had only a}} quarter of an hour to spare to put myself in order for dinner, and to say two words to Laura before I went downstairs.|$|E
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my {{breakfast in}} the Boar's coffee-room, I found Mr. Pumblechook conversing with the landlord. Mr. Pumblechook (not {{improved}} in appearance by his late nocturnal adventure) was waiting for me, and addressed me in the following terms:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That was the scheme, but {{it seems}} he had promised some people he met on the boat {{to go to a}} theatre and have a bit of supper with them afterwards. I only heard about it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> this morning." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{had an idea}} I'd like Bond Street all {{the better}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back.</b> <b>I</b> never knew that I should be eaten alive by every kind of disgusting animal by night and day. I say, Doctor, {{do you ever think}} of a rump steak? ...|$|R
60|$|It {{must have}} been half-past five <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> home. <b>I</b> stepped in; and there sat old Mack {{on the back of}} his neck in his old clothes with his blue socks on the window and the History of Civilisation propped up on his knees.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes;--is it not? Twelve {{years ago}} I {{took off my}} shoes and {{stockings}} and had them dried in that cottage, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the house I was put to bed for having been out all day in the wood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I haven't forgotten," [...] said Woods. [...] "You {{counted out}} twenty fifties without a word. I'll {{pay it back}} some day. That {{thousand}} saved me and--well, they were piling my furniture {{out on the sidewalk}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the house." ...|$|E
60|$|I woke up B. <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the carriage, {{and persuaded}} him to go and have a wash; and in {{listening}} to the distant sound of his remarks when he likewise discovered {{that there was no}} towel, the recollection of my own discomfiture passed gently away.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{impression}} of him has never left it. Fate is in it. Again, {{that night at}} the Brinsmades', when we were in fancy dress, I felt that I had lost you <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back.</b> He had been there <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was away, and gone again. And--and--you never told me." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back,</b> all {{the party}} were {{assembling}} {{for a late}} tea. Coming fresh from the exhilaration of nature, {{it struck me as}} almost comic that we, who were nearing the end of so strange--almost monstrous--an undertaking, should be yet bound by the needs and habits of our lives.|$|R
5000|$|<b>I</b> was {{determined}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> World War II combatthat what rights I didnt have I {{was going to}} take, using every weapon in the arsenal of democracy. After nine years in the Marine Corps, I dont intend to take another order from any {{son of a bitch}} that walks. Cecil B. Moore ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the house}} already dismally affected, I was still more sadly downcast {{at the sight}} of Mary. She had her sleeves rolled up over her strong arms, and was quietly making bread. I got a bannock from the dresser and sat down to eat it in silence.|$|E
60|$|It {{was past}} ten o'clock that night <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the camp, where I found Hans the Hottentot {{about to start}} to look for me, {{with two of the}} Zulus, and told him that I had been {{detained}} by accidents to the wagon. The Vrouw Prinsloo was still up also, waiting to hear of my arrival.|$|E
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Horta from Cayenne {{and saw the}} [...] "Anarchist" [...] again, he did {{not look}} well. He was more worn, still more frail, and very livid indeed under the grimy smudges of his calling. Evidently the meat of the company's main herd (in its {{unconcentrated}} form) did not agree with him at all.|$|E
3000|$|... “ (…) [Melinda] is {{a really}} nice girl. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> she was there asking me: Mamita Catalina are you O.K? Do you need something? I don’t send {{the money to the}} boys {{directly}} because boys are boys {{at the end of the}} story we [women] take care of each other.”(Catalina, 50, MDW, residing in Brussels).|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>I</b> {{found that}} {{the route of the}} fugitives, who had now joined into one party, had been {{definitely}} ascertained. They had gone south, but manifestly taking alarm from the advancing line of guards, had headed up again to the north-east, where the country was broader and the mountains wilder and less inhabited.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, not altogether," [...] he replied, [...] "at least, {{not in a}} worldly sense. He {{left his}} affairs in a very {{complicated}} state, and his eldest son went straight up to London to consult me about them, and, not finding me there, and time being important, went to Kebble. I was rather disappointed <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> and heard about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my observatory, I found Mr. Jay digesting his mutton-chops in an armchair, {{with his}} pipe in his mouth. On his table were two tumblers, {{a jug of}} water, and the pint bottle of brandy. It was then close upon seven o'clock. As the hour struck the person {{described}} as [...] "Jack" [...] walked in.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> {{the nursery}} {{there was such}} an uproar in the parlor that I looked in, and there was Mr. Bhaer down {{on his hands and}} knees, with Tina on his back, Kitty leading him with a jump rope, and Minnie feeding two small boys with seedcakes, as they roared and ramped in cages built of chairs.|$|E
60|$|Before dinner I had call to go {{into the}} woodshed. I heard a scuttling as I opened the door. If I am not mistaken, Miss Dorton was hiding in the corner where we keep the coke. I didn't see any good in making a fuss, so I left her there. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the kitchen, cook asked me if we'd got any parsley.|$|E
6000|$|... "Steady, lad. I {{know what}} you're going to say. I {{know all that}} happened. But the first thing <b>I</b> found <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> was that the {{shanghai}} business had saved my life; that but for that I would have really been occupying that box {{on its way to}} England, instead of the poor devil who was taken for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> old Chiswick {{had gone}} to bed, but Bicky was there, hunched up in an arm-chair, {{brooding}} pretty tensely, with a cigarette hanging {{out of the corner}} of his mouth and a more or less glassy stare in his eyes. He had the aspect of one who had been soaked with what the newspaper chappies call [...] "some blunt instrument." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{was away}} {{for a few days}} after that in the country. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>back</b> <b>I</b> found a pile of telegrams waiting for me. They were all from Florence, and they all wanted me to go to Madison Avenue. The last of the batch, which had arrived that morning, was so {{peremptory}} that I felt as if something had bitten me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> read it.|$|R
