Let [...] be the hypothesis {{that there are}} [...] non-black ravens, and suppose that the hypotheses [...] are initially equiprobable. Then, if <b>we</b> <b>happen</b> to see a black raven, the Bayes factor in favour of [...] is ...|$|E
2500|$|... ery bad, to {{have this}} fellow Hunt, ah, you know, ah, it's, he, he knows too damn much and he was {{involved}}, <b>we</b> <b>happen</b> to know that. And that it gets out that the whole, this is all involved in the Cuban thing, that it's a fiasco, and it's {{going to make the}} FBI, ah CIA look bad, it's going to make Hunt look bad, and it's likely to blow the whole, uh, Bay of Pigs thing which we think would be very unfortunate for CIA and for the country at this time, and for American foreign policy, and he just better tough it and lay it on them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I got it. I've {{just been}} reading it. And what I was rather wanting to ask you, if <b>we</b> <b>happened</b> {{to run into}} each other, was--well, what about it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} {{make too much}} of it. Certainly, it was {{fortunate}} <b>we</b> <b>happened</b> to come along; the rest followed. But I can understand how you feel--I had a good mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, but I didn't {{think this}} new thing was coming up," [...] growled Jarvey. [...] "We were to share equal on what <b>we</b> <b>happened</b> {{to get out}} of the greasers. This is another thing entirely." ...|$|R
2500|$|Penrose is an atheist. In {{the film}} A Brief History of Time, he said, [...] "I think I {{would say that}} the {{universe}} has a purpose, it's not somehow just there by chance ... some people, I think, take the view that the universe is just there and it runs along – it's a bit like it just sort of computes, and <b>we</b> <b>happen</b> somehow by accident to find ourselves in this thing. But I don't think that's a very fruitful or helpful {{way of looking at the}} universe, I think that there is something much deeper about it." [...] Penrose is a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{not good}} enough not rather to feel the strain. <b>We</b> <b>happen</b> each, I think, {{to be of the}} kind that are easily spoiled." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because {{there are}} no vacant seats {{anywhere}} near ours," [...] she replied. [...] "You see <b>we</b> <b>happen</b> to know whom {{we are going to}} sit near." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was foolish}} to bring such {{expensive}} silver," [...] declared {{the lady of}} the house. [...] "But I thought we could use it if <b>we</b> <b>happened</b> to have visitors. I never dreamed of being robbed up here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Even seamen {{are divided}} into seamen gunners, {{apprentices}} and the like, and if you went on as a mere boy you might not see me once a week, unless <b>we</b> <b>happened</b> to be off duty at the same time." ...|$|R
6000|$|Again {{and again}} the line moved up, and we were slowly but surely {{approaching}} the wicket. At the moment <b>we</b> <b>happened</b> to be standing on an iron grating, and a man appearing underneath, the old sailor called down to him,-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, we {{came on the}} Aquitaine!" [...] said Mrs. Vostrand, with a {{smile for}} Jeff. [...] "But how did <b>we</b> <b>happen</b> not to see one another?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you, sir. That {{would be}} excellent, and would {{certainly}} {{enable us to}} face a small party of the enemy, if <b>we</b> <b>happen</b> to encounter them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, we can't, Pater, but it's {{my opinion}} we shall both fall {{unanimously}} {{in love with}} her, at any rate, whenever <b>we</b> <b>happen</b> to see her." ...|$|E
2500|$|Those {{few months}} I lived on carrots that <b>we</b> <b>happened</b> {{to grow in}} the garden. [...] And, if I ever see another soup bone {{it is going to be}} too many. [...] From that day to this, I don’t boil a soup bone.|$|R

6000|$|... "Nothing much, only if that hen-yard gate {{should happen}} to be left open, and if Farmer Brown's boy {{should happen to}} forget to close that little hole that the hens go through, and if <b>we</b> <b>happened</b> to be around at just that time--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{welcome you}} shall have," [...] cried Baucis, [...] "and {{likewise}} a little honey that <b>we</b> <b>happen</b> to have left, {{and a bunch}} of purple grapes besides." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, my dear. Who {{would think}} of looking there for fifty {{thousand}} dollars? And no one knows <b>we</b> <b>happen</b> {{to have so much}} money with us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thanks--middlings be it. Why, as I was saying, must I disarrange my fur and my {{digestion}} {{to chase}} you round the dusty arena whenever <b>we</b> <b>happen</b> to meet?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't stand {{near the}} foot of the masts, lads; keep well away from them. There is nothing to be afraid of, in those lights; but if <b>we</b> <b>happened</b> to be struck by {{lightning}} and it ran down the mast, some of you might be knocked over.|$|R
6000|$|... "We've {{just come}} on a visit, you know," [...] said Ozma. [...] "Both Dorothy and I were {{wondering}} how we should pass the day when <b>we</b> <b>happened</b> to think we'd not been to your Quadling Country for weeks, so we took the Sawhorse and rode straight here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's it! 'injerdishus acquaintances!' But {{just because}} <b>we</b> might <b>happen</b> to have friends, or even be sorter related to folks in another line o' {{business}} that ain't none o' ours, the kempany hain't no call to persecute US for it! S'pose <b>we</b> do <b>happen</b> to know some one like"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At twelve o'clock precisely," [...] {{answered}} Mrs. Basswood. [...] "That is, of course, if <b>we</b> <b>happen</b> {{to be in}} {{the right}} kind of a place. We don't want to stop just anywhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me, Mab," [...] said Amy, [...] "relationships must branch out. The only {{difference}} is, that <b>we</b> <b>happen</b> to {{know some of}} the people concerned. Such things are going on every day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] {{said the}} optimistic Rowley, [...] "water's {{the main thing}} after all. If <b>we</b> <b>happen</b> to strike river gold, thar's the stream for washing it; if <b>we</b> <b>happen</b> to drop into quartz--and that thar rock looks mighty likely--thar ain't a more natural-born site for a mill than that right bank, with water enough to run fifty stamps. That {{hillside}} is an original dump for your tailings, and a ready found inclined road for your trucks, fresh {{from the hands of}} Providence; and that road we're kalkilatin' to build to the turnpike will run just easy along that ridge." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cable's {{first wife}} was Olympia Rebelo, a Goan Roman Catholic, {{whom he met}} [...] "in the unromantic setting of a York mental {{hospital}} where <b>we</b> <b>happened</b> to be working as nurses during a summer holiday."

6000|$|... "It’s just {{a little}} bit ’o bisness <b>we</b> <b>’appened</b> to drop on,’ ses Sam, at last, ’me an’ Peter, and I think that, with luck and management, we’re in a fair way to make our fortunes. Peter, ’ere, ain’t given to looking on the cheerful side o’ things, but ’e thinks so, too.’ ...|$|R
60|$|Sheen, it seemed, {{had escaped}} destruction, {{but the place}} was silent and deserted. Here <b>we</b> <b>happened</b> on no dead, though the night was too dark {{for us to see}} into the side roads of the place. In Sheen my {{companion}} suddenly complained of faintness and thirst, and we decided to try one of the houses.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it does," [...] {{retorted}} Goggles, [...] "because <b>we</b> <b>happen</b> {{to agree}} with them. If I could earn five pounds a week as juvenile lead, I would never play a comic part again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! perfectly; {{he is the}} son of an old admiral, under whom I was educated, though <b>we</b> <b>happen</b> {{ourselves}} {{never to}} have met. Sir Brown is the name and title of the gentleman." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Introduce me, now there's a good fellow," [...] he said, [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>happen</b> {{to meet it}} together!" [...] And the Bellman, sagaciously nodding his head, [...] Said [...] "That must {{depend on}} the weather." ...|$|E
60|$|As one funny young gentleman {{will serve}} as a sample of all funny young Gentlemen we purpose merely to note down the conduct and {{behaviour}} of an individual specimen of this class, whom <b>we</b> <b>happened</b> to meet at an annual family Christmas party {{in the course of this}} very last Christmas that ever came.|$|R
60|$|I thought not. There {{was nothing}} at all {{uncommon}} in the stranger's inquiries, taken by themselves. We had no right, that I could see, to alarm the widow, because <b>we</b> <b>happened</b> to attach purely fanciful suspicions to a man of whom we knew nothing. I expressed this opinion to Mr. Engelman; and he agreed with me.|$|R
60|$|At this his {{features}} gathered together for another outburst, which I succeeded in stifling only by warning him that {{so long as}} he remained at Mrs Monnerie's he must completely forget the old cow and the thunderstorm, and never address me in company, or even glance in my direction if <b>we</b> <b>happened</b> to be together in the same room.|$|R
