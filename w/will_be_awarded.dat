5|$|Throughout the stages, {{the player}} may enter doors to access seven {{different}} types of chambers. Stores and black markets offer items in exchange for hearts, which are left behind by defeated monsters. Treasure chambers contain items, enemy nests give the player an opportunity to earn extra hearts, and hot springs restore Pit's health. In the god's chamber, the strength of Pit's bow and arrow may be increased depending on several factors, such {{as the number of}} enemies defeated and the amount of damage taken in battle. In the training chamber, Pit <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>awarded</b> with one of the three power items if he passes a test of endurance.|$|E
5|$|Both {{enemies and}} their bullets can be shot down. Defeating enemies will {{sometimes}} reveal item boxes, which can hold precious metals such as {{gold and silver}} for extra points, and bombs. Only five bombs can be held at a time, {{which can be used}} to clear the screen of enemies. Weapon upgrades may appear after defeating certain enemies. These weapons, such as shotguns and machine guns, will increase the player's firing speed or damage output. When a player's bullets hit an enemy, a gauge {{at the bottom of the}} screen will gradually fill. Once filled, the player <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>awarded</b> with a Vulcan gun, the most powerful weapon in the game which grants invincibility. The gauge will then begin to deplete and the Vulcan gun will disappear once empty.|$|E
5|$|Despite Lyoto Machida's {{knockout}} of Thiago Silva, Dana White {{indicated that}} he was not the number one contender for a title shot. Instead, a scheduled fight between former UFC Light Heavyweight Champion Quinton Jackson and Keith Jardine would determine Machida's title fate. A victory for Jackson would earn him a fight with champion Rashad Evans, but a win for Jardine would mean Machida <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>awarded</b> with a title shot. Jackson won the fight via unanimous decision, but torn ligaments in his jaw forced the former champion out of the bout. Instead, Machida will challenge Evans for the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship at UFC 98. Jackson will retain his title shot against the winner of that match upon returning from injury. Following the loss to Machida, Thiago Silva was scheduled to return to action against former champion Forrest Griffin at UFC 101, but his opponent was later changed to Keith Jardine.|$|E
