25|$|There are {{two factors}} that can change the {{temperature}} of a fluid during an adiabatic expansion: a change in internal energy or the conversion between potential and kinetic internal energy. Temperature is the measure of thermal kinetic energy (energy associated with molecular motion); so a change in temperature indicates a change in thermal kinetic energy. The internal energy {{is the sum of}} thermal kinetic energy and thermal potential energy. Thus, even if the internal energy does not change, the temperature can change due to conversion between kinetic and potential energy; this is <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> free expansion and typically produces a decrease in temperature as the fluid expands. If work is done on or by the fluid as it expands, then the total internal energy changes. This is <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Joule–Thomson expansion and can produce larger heating or cooling than observed in a free expansion.|$|E

[...] On entering the column, the feed starts flowing down {{but part of}} it, the component(s) with lower boiling point(s), vaporizes and rises. However, as it rises, it cools and while part of it continues up as vapor, some of it (enriched in the less volatile component) begins to descend again.|$|E

Douglas wrote: [...] "The present law proceeds on a principle repugnant to our society—guilt by association. What happens under this law is typical of <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> police state.

500|$|Throughout the game, a [...] "personality transfer" [...] {{phenomenon}} frequently causes Cocoro's and Satoru's {{minds to}} switch places with each other, leaving {{them in the}} other person's body. As the player only learns what their current character experiences, they need {{to play the game}} as both characters in order to access all information. Choices the player makes as one of the characters also affect <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> playthrough as the other; for instance, if the player chooses to drink water as Satoru, there will be no water left if they play through the game as Cocoro, and if they get into an argument with a character as Cocoro, their relationship to that character becomes strained when they play the game as Satoru.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the film}} {{received}} critical acclaim and several awards, Allen himself was disappointed with it, {{and said in}} an interview, [...] "When Annie Hall started out, that film {{was not supposed to}} be what I wound up with. The film was supposed to be <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> guy's mind... Nobody understood anything that went on. The relationship between myself and Diane Keaton was all anyone cared about. That was not what I cared about... In the end, I had to reduce the film to just me and Diane Keaton, and that relationship, so I was quite disappointed in that movie". Allen has repeatedly declined to make a sequel, and in a 1992 interview stated that [...] "Sequelism has become an annoying thing. [...] I don't think Francis Coppola should have done Godfather III because Godfather II was quite great. [...] When they make a sequel, it's just a thirst for more money, so I don't like that idea so much".|$|E

2500|$|Charles Taylor defines metanoia as [...] "to change one's mind of attitude" [...] {{and builds}} his {{pastoral}} counseling method on the [...] "metanoia model." [...] In doing so, Taylor recalls {{that the center}} of Jesus' ministry was a call to metanoia. For Milton Crum, metanoia means [...] "a change of perception with its behavioral fruit." [...] Thus, metanoia constitutes the central thing that needs to happen in preaching. Peter Senge observes that <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> [...] "learning organization" [...] that experiences the [...] "deeper meaning of 'learning'" [...] is [...] "metanoia" [...] which means [...] "a shift of mind." [...] Therefore, concludes Senge, [...] "to grasp the meaning of 'metanoia' is to grasp the deeper meaning of 'learning.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|The Prinzregentenzeit ("prince's regent's time"), as the regency of Luitpold {{is often}} called, {{was due to}} the {{political}} passiveness of Luitpold an era of the gradual transfer of Bavarian interests behind those of the German empire. In connection with the unhappy end of the preceding rule of King Ludwig II this break in the Bavarian monarchy looked even stronger. Finally, the constitutional amendment of 1913 brought the determining break in the continuity of the king's rule in the opinion of historians, particularly as this change had been granted by the Landtag as a House of Representatives and meant therefore indirectly the first step from constitutional to the parliamentary monarchy. Today the connection of these two developments is regarded as a main cause for the unspectacular end of the Bavarian kingdom without opposition {{in the course of the}} November revolution of 1918. However the course of his 26-year regency Luitpold knew to overcome, by modesty, ability and popularity, the initial uneasiness of his subjects. These prince regent's years were transfigured, finally—above all in the retrospect – to a golden age of Bavaria, even if one mourned the [...] "fairy tale king" [...] Ludwig II furthermore <b>what</b> <b>happens</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> folkloric-nostalgic manner till this day.|$|E
