Gods worshipped include traditional Roman deities such as Jupiter, Mars, Mercury and Silvanus and Celtic and Germanic ones such as Garmangabis. From such stones and building inscriptions <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> built the fort and eventually garrisoned it.|$|E
500|$|The {{decision}} was praised in the U.S. by the litigants, their counsel, and politicians. Theodore Olson, {{counsel for the}} respondents, praised the ruling, saying it [...] "will bring long-overdue relief to ... victims of Iranian terrorism and their families, {{many of whom have}} waited decades for redress." [...] Praising the court's decision, lead plaintiff Deborah Peterson found solace that [...] "in the eyes of the law, <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> is responsible, and those who are responsible have been brought to the justice that we are capable of bringing them to here on earth." ...|$|E
500|$|Harring {{described}} her interpretation {{after seeing the}} film: [...] "When I saw it the first time, I {{thought it was the}} story of Hollywood dreams, illusion and obsession. It touches on the idea that nothing is quite as it seems, especially the idea of being a Hollywood movie star. The second and third times I saw it, I thought it dealt with identity. Do <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> we are? And then I kept seeing different things in it... There's no right or wrong to what someone takes away from it or what they think the film is really about. It's a movie that makes you continuously ponder, makes you ask questions. I've heard over and over, 'This is a movie that I'll see again' or 'This is a movie you've got to see again.' It intrigues you. You want to get it, but I don't think it's a movie to be gotten. It's achieved its goal if it makes you ask questions." ...|$|E

500|$|At a {{dialogue}} on {{the changes to}} the Elected President scheme on 15 September 2016, Law Minister K. Shanmugam addressed the allegation, saying: [...] "sk yourself logically, [...] do we, as a Government, do what is right, based on the system, or do we worry [...] some {{people are going to}} say this is to knock out people we don't like? You know, more than 1,000 people will qualify from the private sector. Do you think <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> they are and we can make sure that they are all going to be OK? It’s not possible." [...] He also expressed the view that Tan would not satisfy the new qualification criteria as he had held a non-executive post in a company, and the company did not have shareholders' equity of at least $500 million. In a Facebook post two days later, Tan asked: [...] "Is there some truth after all that the changes in the rules was to make sure I would not be eligible? It would be a sad day for Singaporeans if a constitutional change was made because of an individual." [...] The Singapore Government denied the accusation, Shanmugam stating at another forum held on 18 September that the amendments to the Elected President scheme were aimed at [...] "improving the system for Singapore's long-term future, not at barring certain individuals from standing".|$|E

2500|$|In a 14 February 2007 {{news conference}} U.S. President George W. Bush reiterated {{his claim that}} the Quds Force was causing unrest in Iraq, stating: [...] "I can say with {{certainty}} that the Quds force, {{a part of the}} Iranian government, has provided these sophisticated IEDs that have harmed our troops. And I'd like to repeat, I do not know whether or not the Quds Force was ordered from the top echelons of government. But my point is what's worse – them ordering it and it happening, or them not ordering it and it happening? And so we will continue to protect our troops. ... to say it [...] is provoking Iran is just a wrong way to characterize the Commander-in-Chief's decision to do what is necessary to protect our soldiers in harm's way. And I will continue to do so. ... Whether Ahmadinejad ordered the Quds force to do this, I don't think we know. But we do know that they're there, and I intend to do something about it. And I've asked our commanders to do something about it. And we're going to protect our troops. ... I don't think <b>we</b> <b>know</b> <b>who</b> {{picked up the phone and}} said to the Quds Force, go do this, but we know it's a vital part of the Iranian government. …What matters is, is that we're responding. The idea that somehow we're manufacturing the idea that the Iranians are providing IEDs is preposterous. ... My job is to protect our troops. And when we find devices that are in that country that are hurting our troops, we're going to do something about it, pure and simple. ... does this mean you're trying to have a pretext for war? No. It means I'm trying to protect our troops." ...|$|E
