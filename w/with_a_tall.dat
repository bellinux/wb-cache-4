25|$|Transcutaneous pacing (TCP), {{also called}} {{external}} pacing, {{is recommended for}} the initial stabilization of hemodynamically significant bradycardias of all types. The procedure is performed by placing two pacing pads on the patient's chest, either in the anterior/lateral position or the anterior/posterior position. The rescuer selects the pacing rate, and gradually increases the pacing current (measured in mA) until electrical capture (characterized by a wide QRS complex <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>tall,</b> broad T wave on the ECG) is achieved, with a corresponding pulse. Pacing artifact on the ECG and severe muscle twitching may make this determination difficult. External pacing should not be relied upon {{for an extended period}} of time. It is an emergency procedure that acts as a bridge until transvenous pacing or other therapies can be applied.|$|E
