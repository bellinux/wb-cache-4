It was at a melancholy {{point in my life}} and the song reflects the yearning that was going on inside of me. It was like being in a situation but you want to break free and you can't, so your confined yet you're releasing those emotion through the lyrics and the actual act of singing. Thats why {{think a lot of people}} felt very strongly about that song, because the emotion is clear when you listen to it.|$|E

But the fielding of the team as a whole was thought to be brittle. Moroney...would never be accused of being a mobile unit of the out-cricket, and Ian Johnson <b>was,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> opinion, anyhow, a very doubtful quantity especially as a slip-fieldsman, where he seemed likely to do duty...I sympathized with Hassett over the big job he faced in getting good fielding done with the quality of the manpower as his disposal. There were only five good fieldsmen in the group of twelve chosen. These were Harvey, Miller, Morris, Loxton and Archer, and Archer was the supernumerary.|$|E

Sitting Bull led the Sioux and the Cheyenne in the Battle of Little Bighorn against General Custer and the 7th Cavalry Regiment. After the battle, the Sioux retreated to Saskatchewan, settling in the Wood Mountain area. The first group of Sioux was sent as a scouting party. They crossed the border along Frenchman river below the present villages of Val Marie and Mankota. They arrived at Jean-Louis Légaré’s trading-post on November 17, 1876. “I <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> store with two of my men, when a dozen savages on horseback appeared.” They told Légaré they needed supplies and came to “sleep in peace.” Légaré gave them $30 in goods and they went away.

[...] James Marsters further discussed ways in which John is a doppelgänger or foil to Captain Jack: both are pansexual time travellers, with their key difference being that John never reformed. The character exaggerates many of Jack's qualities, for example displaying zoophilic attraction to non-humanoids such as poodles, in addition to men and women.

500|$|Takemitsu's {{sensitivity}} to instrumental and orchestral timbre {{can be heard}} throughout his work, and is often made apparent by the unusual instrumental combinations he specified. This is evident in works such as November Steps, that combine traditional Japanese instruments, shakuhachi and biwa, with a conventional Western orchestra. It may also be discerned in his works for ensembles that make no use of traditional instruments, for example Quotation of Dream (1991), Archipelago S., for 21 players (1993), and ArcI & II (1963–66/1976). In these works, the more conventional orchestral forces are divided into unconventional [...] "groups". Even where these instrumental combinations were determined by the particular ensemble commissioning the work, [...] "Takemitsu's genius for instrumentation (and genius it <b>was,</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> view) ...", {{in the words of}} Oliver Knussen, [...] "... creates the illusion that the instrumental restrictions are self-imposed".|$|E
