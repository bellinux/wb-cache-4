25|$|At one time, 25 {{subspecies}} of beavers {{were identified}} in North America, with distinctions based primarily on slight morphological differences and geographical isolation {{at the time of}} discovery. However, modern techniques generally use genetics rather than morphology to distinguish between subspecies, and currently the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (which provides authoritative taxonomic information on plants, animals, fungi, and microbes of North America and the <b>world)</b> <b>does</b> not recognize any subspecies of C. canadensis, though a definitive genetic analysis has not been performed. Such an analysis would be {{complicated by the fact that}} substantial genetic mixing of populations has occurred because of the numerous reintroduction efforts intended to help the species recover following extirpation from many regions.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{cautions}} that we cannot feel or intuit {{this world of}} the understanding. He also stresses that {{we are unable to}} make interesting positive claims about it because we are not able to experience the world of the understanding. Kant argues that we cannot use the notion of the world of the understanding to explain how freedom is possible or how pure reason could {{have anything to say about}} practical matters because we simply do not and cannot have a clear enough grasp of the world of the understanding. The notion of an intelligible <b>world</b> <b>does</b> point us towards the idea of a kingdom of ends, which is a useful and important idea. We just have to be careful not to get carried away and make claims that we are not entitled to.|$|E

25|$|Craig {{examines}} arguments {{aimed at}} showing either that God is timeless or omnitemporal. He defends the coherence of a timeless and personal being, but {{says that the}} arguments for divine timelessness are unsound or inconclusive. By contrast, he gives two {{arguments in favor of}} divine temporality. First, he says that if a temporal world exists, then in virtue of his real relations to that world, God cannot remain untouched by its temporality. Craig says that given God's changing relations with the world he must change at least extrinsically, which is sufficient for his existing temporally. Second, Craig says that if a temporal world exists, then in virtue of his omniscience, God must know tensed facts about the world, such as what is happening now, which Craig argues is sufficient for his being temporally located. Craig argues that, since a temporal <b>world</b> <b>does</b> exist, it follows that God exists in time.|$|E

500|$|In 1973, rice rats were {{discovered}} at Cudjoe Key in the Florida Keys, and in 1978 Spitzer and Lazell described this {{population as a}} new species, Oryzomys argentatus. The status of this form—either a distinct species or not even subspecifically distinct from O.palustris natator—has remained controversial since; the 2005 third edition of Mammal Species of the <b>World</b> <b>does</b> not recognize O.argentatus as a separate species, but acknowledges a need for further research. A 2005 study using microsatellite DNA found that Florida Keys rice rats exhibit low genetic variation and are significantly different from Everglades rice rats; the study concluded in favor of classifying the Keys rice rat as a [...] "distinct vertebrate population". This population probably diverged from mainland rice rats about 2000 years ago.|$|E
500|$|At that time, {{it seemed}} a place in which {{anything}} could happen—new industrial processes, new ways of thinking (the Manchester School, promoting free trade and laissez-faire), new classes or groups in society, new religious sects, and new forms of labour organisation. It attracted educated visitors {{from all parts of}} Britain and Europe. A saying capturing this sense of innovation survives today: [...] "What Manchester does today, the rest of the <b>world</b> <b>does</b> tomorrow."•• Manchester's golden age was perhaps {{the last quarter of the}} 19th century. Many of the great public buildings (including Manchester Town Hall) date from then. The city's cosmopolitan atmosphere contributed to a vibrant culture, which included the Hallé Orchestra. In 1889, when county councils were created in England, the municipal borough became a county borough with even greater autonomy.|$|E

Many years later Jacques Monod pointed out to me that I did not appear to understand the correct use of the word dogma, which is a belief that cannot be doubted. I did apprehend this in a vague sort of way but since I thought that all religious beliefs were without foundation, I used the word the way I myself thought about it, not as most of the <b>world</b> <b>does,</b> and simply applied it to a grand hypothesis that, however plausible, had little direct experimental support." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{problem with}} metaphysical realism, {{according}} to Putnam, {{was that it}} fails to explain the possibility of reference and truth. According to the metaphysical realist, our concepts and categories refer because they match up in some mysterious manner with the pre-structured categories, kinds and individuals that are inherent in the external world. But {{how is it possible}} that the world [...] "carves up" [...] into certain structures and categories, the mind carves up the world into its own categories and structures, and the two [...] "carvings" [...] perfectly coincide? The answer must be that the <b>world</b> <b>does</b> not come pre-structured but that structure must be imposed on it by the human mind and its conceptual schemes. [...] In Reason, Truth, and History, Putnam identified truth with what he termed [...] "idealized rational acceptability." [...] The theory, which owes something to C. S. Peirce, is that a belief is true if it would be accepted by anyone under ideal epistemic conditions.|$|E
500|$|As {{had also}} {{been the case with}} his predecessors, the rank of {{adjutant}} was seen by Joaquim Inácio as an embarrassment. Inside the armada administration, it denoted the most important office, as it was filled by an officer who acted as the navy minister's direct representative in the armada. Even so, the title of [...] "adjutant" [...] was itself perceived as demeaning. Joaquim Inácio later complained: [...] "In what part of the <b>world...</b> <b>does</b> the navy minister have a general officer as an adjutant? What is an adjutant, other than a young officer who transmits orders, and even messages, he receives from his chief?" [...] He concluded: [...] "Thus the title of adjutant cannot encumber an officer who supervises the armada's discipline and answers for it." [...] His request to have the designation for the position changed to a more appropriate title was ignored. He also felt slighted that many of his proposals to the navy boards regarding improvements were not acted on, and on 21 November 1860, he asked to be removed from all positions.|$|E

500|$|The {{video is}} similar to the director's cut, but has a few differences. The choreography cut offers lengthier shots of Spears and her dancers, and much of the apocalypse storyline is edited out. The clip's ending is also {{different}} from the original: instead of emerging from the manhole Spears just looks into the camera, apparently still hiding in the underground party and hinting at a darker ending in which the <b>world</b> <b>does</b> end. On April 9, 2011, Spears tweeted that she had seen the final cut of the dance version, and was not sure which one she liked best. Ray Kay tweeted on April 14, 2011, that the original version of the video was better, [...] "but it's fun to watch the choreography too." [...] The video, titled [...] "DANCE Till the World Ends" [...] premiered on April 15, 2011. Leah Collins of Dose commented, [...] "sorry, Team Britney, but if any of you were hoping to pass off Spears’ anemic performance in the original as the result of unfortunate editing, this clip isn’t exactly going to bring anyone back on side." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{historian}} Ahmad Y. al-Hassan, {{during the}} Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260, the Mamluks used cannons against the Mongols. He claims {{that this was}} [...] "the first cannon in history" [...] and used a gunpowder formula almost identical to the ideal composition for explosive gunpowder. He also argues {{that this was not}} known in China or Europe until much later. Hassan further claims that the earliest textual evidence of cannons is from the middle east, based on earlier originals which report hand-held cannon being used by the Mamluks at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260. However Hassan's claims have been refuted by other historians such as Iqtidar Alam Khan, Joseph Needham, and Toino Andrade. Khan argues that it was the Mongols who introduced gunpowder to the Islamic world, and cites Mamluk antagonism towards early riflemen in their infantry {{as an example of how}} gunpowder weapons were not always met with open acceptance in the Middle East. According to Needham, the term midfa, dated to textual sources from 1342 to 1352, did not refer to true hand-guns or bombards, and contemporary accounts of a metal-barrel cannon in the Islamic <b>world</b> <b>does</b> not occur until 1365 Andrade too dates the textual appearance of cannons in middle eastern sources to the 1360s.|$|E
500|$|After its release, {{the book}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews. It was listed by Rolling Stone {{as one of}} the 10 Best Music Books in 2016. Jason Diamond from the publication reviewed it and found that the book gave a [...] "fuller, weirder and more interesting overview of Madonna" [...] than was already present in previous works about her. He complimented the author's [...] "riveting" [...] way of presenting the past figures from Bay City associated with the singer as well as Simone's own transition into indie music. Jennifer Levin from The Santa Fe New Mexican commended Simone's [...] "wit and grace" [...] in reporting Bay City's troubled relationship with Madonna, including the political agenda surrounding her. She noted that the story found its footing at the point in the book where the author wrote about Flying Wedge (in the last chapter). Writing for PopMatters, Megan Volpert rated the book 7 out of 10 stars, and described it as [...] "excellent", suggesting it as an important addition to modern cultural criticism. She commended Simone's writing and her courage to pick up an unusual subject for the book. Volpert commented, [...] "Does the world need one more half-baked biographical update on Madonna? No, it does not. What the <b>world</b> <b>does</b> need is Simone's productively clear-eyed assessment of her own musical and journalistic failures, [...] for the detours unavoidably provoked by fame and fandom," [...] concluded the review.|$|E
