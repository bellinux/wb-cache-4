5|$|In the {{vicinity}} of Gravesend, the right-hand German formation – comprising the Do 17s of KG 3, trailed by the He 111s of KG 26 – would {{bear the brunt of}} the next attack from 63 fighters from 17, 46, 249, 257, 504 and 603 Squadrons. The Hurricanes of 249 and 504 squadrons went into action first. Their first pass saw three Do 17s go down, including Hauptmann Ernst Püttmann, leading 5. Staffel of KG 3 (5./KG 3). The Bf 109s escorting KG 26 could only watch, forbidden to leave their Heinkel charges. As the first attack finished, No. 257 Squadron led by Squadron Leader Robert Stanford Tuck attacked the Heinkels with nine Hurricanes. The escorts had their <b>work</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> and were scattered. No. 257 targeted the badly protected bombers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1746, the Fairfield East Association of Ministers {{contacted}} the Church at the Unity Parish in Trumbull and advised them that Reverend Beebe was ready to become the minister at their parish. Beebe was ordained and installed at Unity Parish in May 1747. Beebe had his <b>work</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> for him though, as the church had become scattered in 1744 by the conversion to Episcopacy by the last pastor, Reverend Richardson Miner. Under Beebe's leadership, 167 parishioners {{were added to the}} Unity Church rolls. Reverend Beebe's ministry in Trumbull lasted for 38 years until he died in office on September 8, 1785, in his 68th year.|$|E
25|$|The {{action in}} this year's Tour Championships {{began with the}} Red Group with Wimbledon {{champion}} Petra Kvitová and 2008 finalist Vera Zvonareva. Having lost to Zvonareva in straight sets {{just a few weeks}} ago in Tokyo, Kvitová had her <b>work</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> for her, but this time it was different - Kvitová hadn't lost an indoor match all year and her huge serve, powerful groundstrokes and strong net play were working like a charm as she raced out to a 6–2, 4–1 lead. Things got tougher as the unforced errors began to creep into Kvitová's game, and Zvonareva closed the gap to 4–all in the second set; but the No.3-seeded Kvitová broke again for 5–4 and served it out, getting two errors in a row from the No.6-seeded Zvonareva to get to match point then knifing a forehand volley. The series between the two is now knotted at 3–3. Kvitová ended with an even differential, 24 winners to 24 errors; she won 17 of 23 net points (including match point). Zvonareva was −9 (eight winners, 17 errors).|$|E

Half an hour sufficed for this.|$|R

2500|$|Paul Moore {{took over}} as manager after the {{resignation}} of Adam Lakeland mid season on 2016/2017. With off-field developments overshadowing {{the hard work of}} players and management, the new-look team struggled {{at the lower end of}} the table for much of the season and Paul certainly had his <b>work</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> from the start. [...] Sadly, the writing was on the wall for Vics and despite some last-gasp heroics and potential lifelines at the end of the season, the announcement came that the Club was to enter administration yet again (along with the inevitable 10-point deduction) and relegation to Step 5 was confirmed. Paul Moore was replaced as manager by Steve Wilkes in September 2017.|$|E
2500|$|The {{second half}} was {{reported}} to be a [...] "very poor exhibition of football" [...] with substitutes playing at most positions. [...] Michigan's sole points of the second half came on a fumble recovery by William Louis Day. [...] Michigan missed the extra point kicks on its final three touchdowns. [...] (Touchdowns were worth five points and goals from touchdown (or extra points) worth one point under 1898 rules.) [...] Guy Blencoe also missed a field goal from placement from the 40-yard line in the second half. [...] In assessing the team's performance, the Detroit Free Press opined that the team was green, ragged, and slow, and concluded that [...] "the coaches certainly have their <b>work</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> for them {{if they are going to}} make a winning team out of the raw material at hand." ...|$|E
2500|$|Shortly {{after the}} attempt on Paul's life, Scott McGregor was {{introduced}} to the cast as Detective Brennan, who was placed in charge of the investigation. Brennan wasted no time in questioning the Ramsay Street residents, but he received conflicting information. Jackie Brygel from TV Week reported that Mark would have his <b>work</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> for him as everyone was seemingly intent on pointing the finger at someone else. Everyone began jumping to conclusions as they had their own suspicions as to who committed the crime. McGregor explained that Kate Ramsay would give Rebecca a false alibi, while Lyn would get Diana into [...] "strife" [...] and Summer Hoyland (Jordy Lucas) lands Andrew in trouble, but he would not help himself either. Channel 5 ran a poll on their website asking viewers to predict who pushed Paul and over 10,000 votes were cast. The majority of the voters thought it was someone other than the six suspects. 20% thought Diana had pushed Paul, followed by 19% who correctly guessed it was Rebecca. Declan pulled in 16% of the vote, Andrew had 14%, while Lyn drew 6%, Sonya 5% and Toadie had 1%.|$|E

2500|$|The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway’s western {{terminus}} was at Prince Rupert, {{and rail}} construction began from there in 1908. The railway construction firm of Foley, Welch and Stewart built the Distributor and the Skeena and purchased the Omineca in 1908. The latter was wrecked later that summer near Port Essington, but her machinery {{was put in}} another sternwheeler, and she was rechristened under the same name in 1909. That same year Foley, Welch and Stewart launched two more steamers, the Operator and the Conveyor, which would be piloted by Captain Con Myers and Captain Jack Shannon, respectively. These five sternwheelers had their <b>work</b> <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> for them. The construction of the railway from Prince Rupert to Hazelton {{was one of the}} most difficult sections of track that would ever be laid in North America. This [...] stretch would take nearly four years to build and would employ thousands of workers. Four of the company sternwheelers hauled material and supplies for construction, while a fifth, the Skeena, was used almost exclusively to supply food to the camps of the construction workers. Much of these supplies were provided by meatpacker Pat Burns, who had wisely anticipated this need and had a built slaughterhouse at Hazelton.|$|E

For instance, he substantially increased the coverage of female composers and performers, who were almost totally absent from Scholes' work.|$|R
50|$|In 1911, a {{group of}} villagers in Mitterfirmiansreut got the idea to build a snow church in protest that the church {{officials}} did not give them money to build one. The 1910-1911 winter had left a lot of snow, so they {{went to work in}} February. Men and women <b>worked</b> to <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> snow blocks for their church. The finished ice church was 14m long, 7m wide and 4m high. The first worship was held on the 28th of March, 1911. The church gained attention internationally, and the group began to receive donations for construction of a stone church.|$|R
50|$|Once {{manufactured}} {{the tops}} need {{only to be}} cut to length, mitered, fitted for assembly, and end capped (only {{if it is a}} visible finished end). A very specific machine for cutting the postform countertop is manufactured by only a few companies, it is commonly called a Cutting Station, Top Saw, or simply Miter Saw. This machine accurately cuts the countertop to field dimensions, making it easy for the installer to make the final scribe cuts on-site to complete the <b>work.</b> Sink <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> can be made either in the field or at the installers shop.|$|R

It was now necessary to demolish Bridget Bolster, and the opinion was general that if anybody could do it Mr. Chaffanbrass was the man. But there was a doggedness about Bridget Bolster which induced many to doubt whether even Chaffanbrass would be successful. Mr. Aram trusted greatly; but the bar would have preferred to stake their money on Bridget.|$|R
