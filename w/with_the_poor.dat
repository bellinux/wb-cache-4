5|$|Brookwood {{was one of}} the few cemeteries {{to permit}} burials on Sundays, which made it a popular choice <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> as it allowed people to attend {{funerals}} without the need to take a day off work. As theatrical performances were banned on Sundays at this time, it also made Brookwood a popular choice for the burial of actors for the same reason, to the extent that actors were provided with a dedicated section of the cemetery near the station entrance.|$|E
5|$|Princess Andrew {{remained}} at Kreuzlingen for two years, {{but after a}} brief stay at a clinic in Meran was released and began an itinerant, incognito existence in Central Europe.

5|$|The Duke {{was based}} on the BR Standard Class 7 Britannia design. It {{incorporated}} three sets of modified Caprotti valve gear, relatively new to British locomotive engineering and more efficient than Walschaerts or Stephenson valve gear. The Duke was regarded as a failure by locomotive crews due to its poor steaming characteristics and its heavy fuel consumption. Trials undertaken by British Railways also returned negative feedback, reporting problems <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> draughting of the locomotive which resulted in difficulty adhering to the timetables.|$|E
5|$|The club {{decided on}} 4 October 2013 to lay {{artificial}} turf on the field, which it {{hoped would be}} in place ahead of the 2014 season. The club was especially concerned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> surface during March, April, October and November. It also cited the possibility of hosting all trainings at the stadium and that the field could be used 2,000 instead of 130 hours per year. The stadium hosted its second international match on 19 November 2013, when Norway was defeated 0–1 Scotland in a friendly match watched by 9,750 spectators. It {{was the first time}} since 2002 that a home Norway game was not played at the national stadium, Ullevaal Stadion.|$|E

As kickoff drew closer, the Gator Bowl Association expressed displeasure <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> ticket sales, saying that nearly 20,000tickets remained unsold as of {{the week of the}} game and that if it was not a sellout, the game would likely not remain in Jacksonville.|$|E

5|$|The Binding Blade was {{developed}} by Intelligent Systems. It was directed by Tōru Narihiro, and produced by Takehiro Izushi. The designer was Masayuki Horikawa, while programming was handled by Takafumi Kaneko. The scenario was written by Masayuki Horikawa and series newcomer Kouhei Maeda. The character designs were handled by Eiji Kaneda. The music was composed by Yuka Tsujiyoko, who had worked on every title in the series up to that point. The Binding Blade began development as Fire Emblem: Maiden of Darkness, a Fire Emblem title intended for the Nintendo 64 and its peripheral 64DD. This version was revealed in 1997 by Shigeru Miyamoto under the working title Fire Emblem 64. When they were well into the development of Maiden of Darkness, the internal development structure at Intelligent Systems was changed, which combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>poor</b> sales of the 64DD resulted in the game's development being restarted in 2000 for the Game Boy Advance (GBA). Very little of the original Nintendo 64 game concept survived the transition. Aside from the characters Roy and Karel, most of the original game's characters were scrapped. The subtitle Maiden of Darkness remained in use as a working title up until 2001, when it became The Binding Blade. Production on {{the final version of}} The Binding Blade took approximately one year.|$|E
