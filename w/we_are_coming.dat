An {{estimated}} 250,000 to 375,000 attended San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day Parade; newspapers claimed the higher numbers were due to John Briggs. Organizers asked participants to carry signs indicating their hometowns for the cameras, to show how far people came to live in the Castro District. Milk rode in an open car carrying a sign saying [...] "I'm from Woodmere, N.Y." [...] He gave a version of what became his most famous speech, the [...] "Hope Speech", that The San Francisco Examiner said [...] "ignited the crowd":On this anniversary of Stonewall, I ask my gay sisters and brothers to make the commitment to fight. For themselves, for their freedom, for their country... We will not win our rights by staying quietly in our closets... <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> out to fight the lies, the myths, the distortions. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> out to tell the truths about gays, for I am tired of the conspiracy of silence, so I'm going to talk about it. And I want you to talk about it. You must come out. Come out to your parents, your relatives.|$|E

2500|$|The 37th Division on the {{northern}} (left) flank of VII Corps, held a front [...] from north of Gommecourt to Ransart and was to induce the Germans to expect an attack by simulating preparations. No man's land was too wide for an attack, being [...] deep {{from right to left}} and an advanced trench was dug, similar to the one dug by the 56th (1st London) Division. Periodic smoke and gas discharges were to be made and wire-cutting bombardments fired. [...] Moving the gas cylinders was so difficult that batmen, grooms and other non-combatant troops were pressed into service. For five days before Z Day, trench mortars and machine-guns were to fire {{on either side of the}} Monchy Salient. The bombardments were gradually to increase and the divisional artillery was to bombard German positions, roads and the vicinity of Essarts. Smoke was to be released five minutes before zero hour and infantry were to be held ready to support the 46th (North Midland) Division. VII Corps made no attempt at concealment and in the middle of June the 2nd Guard Reserve Division and its six heavy artillery batteries moved up between the 52nd and 111th divisions. Four days before zero hour, Snow told Haig that [...] "They know <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> all right".|$|E

2500|$|Kunle Afolayan {{wanted a}} story {{set in a}} small community; he had writers submit scripts before he got to meet Tunde Babalola who {{eventually}} wrote the script for the film. The script was initially submitted with the title Dust, mainly because the story {{is set in a}} very dusty town. Even though Afolayan didn't want to do big budget projects at the time, he knew he had no choice, as he wanted to interpret the writer's vision adequately because it is a [...] "national film with a universal appeal". He expressed that he liked the story of October 1 because it is a period piece, which he had never done before and [...] "it is also significant to the present state of Nigeria". As a result, he decided to explore the film by adding his own ideas to the subsequent drafts of the script. In an interview, Afolayan pointed out that October 1 is not just an entertainment film, but also informative: [...] "For the older generation, especially those who were part of independence, {{they will be able to}} see themselves in this film. For the younger generation it's a platform for many of them who don't know the story of Nigeria". He also stated that: [...] "We want the younger generation to know where <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> from and the older generation to see if we are moving in the right direction".|$|E

2500|$|As {{the third}} season was {{wrapping}} production in May 2007, Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse negotiated with ABC {{for the show}} to end in three years. [...] The remaining three seasons were to each be a third shorter, containing just sixteen episodes each that would air consecutively week after week from early February through mid-May. [...] The fourth season premiered {{on the last day}} of January in 2008, but was soon interrupted and truncated by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, adding an episode apiece onto the remaining seasons. [...] Then-co-executive producer Edward Kitsis speculated that these would translate into more two-part episodes. [...] The fifth season premiered two weeks early to allow for two breaks in the season for a rerun and a clip-show respectively. [...] In June 2009, the producers ordered an additional hour for the show's final season. [...] Cuse explained that [...] "For us, [...] is just about right. [...] I mean, we aren't sitting here feeling like, 'Oh my God, we need a ton more hours to tell the rest of our story.' [...] It feels like it's going to work out just fine. [...] It will have been the right length." [...] In September, ABC Entertainment president Stephen McPherson advertised that the final season would be the first Lost season to run uninterrupted and entirely repeat-free; however, Cuse said in October that Lost would premiere in January in order to take a two-week break in February to avoid competing with NBC's coverage of the Vancouver Winter Olympic Games.s Final Season Breakup: Winter Olympics to Ruin Everything]", IGN.
