5|$|Tarbosaurus lacked these bony struts, and the {{connection}} between the nasals and lacrimals was weak. Instead, a backwards projection of the maxilla was massively developed in Tarbosaurus and fit inside a sheath formed from the lacrimal. This projection <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin,</b> bony plate in North American tyrannosaurids. The large backwards projection suggests that force was transmitted more directly from the maxilla to the lacrimal in Tarbosaurus. The lacrimal was also more firmly anchored to the frontal and prefrontal bones in Tarbosaurus. The well-developed connections between the maxilla, lacrimal, frontal and prefrontal would have made its entire upper jaw more rigid.|$|E

25|$|In 1832 Dr Thomas Lloyd, a Ludlow {{doctor and}} amateur geologist, met Roderick Murchison at Ludford Corner {{to study the}} rocks exposed along the River Teme and on Whitcliffe, {{advancing}} Murchison's theory for a Silurian System {{that he was to}} publish in 1839. Immediately above the topmost layer of the marine rock sequence forming Murchison's Silurian period <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> layer of dark sand containing numerous remains of early fish, especially their scales, along with plant debris, spores and microscopic mites. In contrast to the underlying sediments of the Ludlow Series which were deposited in a shallow warm sea some 400 million years ago, the Ludlow Bone Bed represents terrestrial (land) conditions and thus a fundamental change in the landscape. At the time, this was believed to be the earliest occurrence of life on land. Murchison thus took the Ludlow Bone Bed as the base of his Devonian Period, although over a century later this boundary was to be moved a little higher, the overlying rocks being ascribed to the Pridoli. The science of geology has taken a number of local names from these studies and now applies them worldwide, in recognition of the importance of this area to scientific understanding, for example Ludlow Series and Whitcliffe Formation. The site is now an SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest) and still attracts international studies.|$|E

500|$|The {{atmosphere}} of Venus {{was discovered in}} 1761 by Russian polymath Mikhail Lomonosov. Venus's atmosphere was observed in 1790 by German astronomer Johann Schröter.

Later, American astronomer Chester Smith Lyman observed a complete ring around {{the dark side of the}} planet when it was at inferior conjunction, providing further evidence for an atmosphere. The atmosphere complicated efforts to determine a rotation period for the planet, and observers such as Italian-born astronomer Giovanni Cassini and Schröter incorrectly estimated periods of about [...] from the motions of markings on the planet's apparent surface.|$|E

In L. lambei, it had a hatchet-like shape when the dinosaur was full-grown, and was somewhat shorter and more rounded in specimens interpreted as females. The [...] "hatchet blade" [...] projected {{in front of the}} eyes, and the [...] "handle" [...] was a solid bony rod that jutted out {{over the back of the}} skull. The [...] "hatchet blade" [...] had two sections: the uppermost portion <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> bony [...] "coxcomb" [...] that grew out relatively late in life, when an individual neared adulthood; and the lower portion held hollow spaces that were continuations of the nasal passages.

2500|$|According to Eugene Chavette, {{author of}} a {{restaurant}} guide in 1867, there were 812 restaurants in Paris, 1,664 cafés, 3,523 debits de vin, 257 crémeries, and 207 tables d'hôtes. [...] The latter were inexpensive eating places, often with a common table, where a meal could be had for 1.6 francs, {{with a bowl of}} soup, a choice of one of three main dishes, a dessert, bread, and a half-bottle of wine. [...] As the guidebook for foreign visitors noted, [...] "A few of these restaurants are truly good; many others are bad." [...] Ingredients were typically of poor quality. The soup <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>thin</b> broth of bouillon; as each spoonful of soup was taken from the pot, an equal amount of water was usually added, so the broth became thinner and thinner.|$|E
