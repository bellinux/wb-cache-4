25|$|<b>Write-protect</b> {{switches}} â€“ Enable or disable {{writing of}} data into memory.|$|E
25|$|All {{cassettes}} {{include a}} write protection mechanism to prevent re-recording and accidental erasure of important material. Each {{side of the}} cassette has a plastic tab on the top that may be broken off, leaving a small indentation in the shell. This indentation allows the entry of a sensing lever that prevents {{the operation of the}} recording function when the cassette is inserted into a cassette deck. If the cassette is held with one of the labels facing the user and the tape opening at the bottom, the <b>write-protect</b> tab for the corresponding side is at the top-left. Occasionally, manufacturers provided a movable panel {{that could be used to}} enable or disable <b>write-protect</b> on tapes.|$|E
25|$|If later required, a {{piece of}} {{adhesive}} tape can be placed over the indentation to bypass the protection, or (on some decks), the lever can be manually depressed to record on a protected tape. Extra care is required to avoid covering the additional indents on high bias or metal bias tape cassettes adjacent to the <b>write-protect</b> tabs.|$|E
50|$|Cards {{could be}} <b>write-protected</b> by diagonally {{clipping}} the {{top left corner}} of the card. HP also sold a number of program collections for scientific and engineering applications on sets of pre-recorded (and <b>write-protected)</b> cards.|$|R
5000|$|Iomega Zip disks were <b>write-protected</b> {{using the}} IomegaWare software.|$|R
50|$|TopXNotes can password-protect {{the entire}} {{database}} or individual notes. It also supports <b>write-protected</b> notes.|$|R
25|$|On {{the left}} side, {{there may be}} a write-protection notch. If the notch is omitted, the card can be read and written. If the card is notched, it is read-only. If the card has a notch and a sliding tab which covers the notch, the user can slide the tab upward (toward the contacts) to declare the card read/write, or {{downward}} to declare it read-only. The diagram to the right shows an orange sliding <b>write-protect</b> tab in both the unlocked and locked positions.|$|E
25|$|The {{cassette}} {{was adapted}} {{into what is}} called a streamer cassette, a version dedicated solely for data storage, and used chiefly for hard disk backups and other types of data. Streamer cassettes look almost exactly the same as a standard cassette, with the exception of having a notch about one quarter-inch wide and deep situated slightly off-center at the top edge of the cassette. Streamer cassettes also have a re-usable <b>write-protect</b> tab on only one side of the top edge of the cassette, with {{the other side of the}} top edge having either only an open rectangular hole, or no hole at all. This is due to the entire one-eighth inch width of the tape loaded inside being used by a streamer cassette drive for the writing and reading of data, hence only one side of the cassette being used. Streamer cassettes can hold anywhere from 50 to 160 megabytes of data.|$|E
25|$|Notches {{on top of}} the {{cassette}} shell indicate the type of tape. Type I cassettes have only <b>write-protect</b> notches, Type II have an additional pair next to the write protection ones, and Type IV (metal) have a third set near the middle of the top of {{the cassette}} shell. These allow later cassette decks to detect the tape type automatically and select the proper bias and equalization. Virtually all recent hi-fi systems (with cassette decks) lack this feature; only a small niche of cassette decks (hi-fi separates) have the tape type selector. Playing Type II and IV tapes on a player without detection will produce exaggerated treble, {{but it may not be}} noticeable because such devices typically have amplifiers that lack extended high-frequency output. Recording on these units, however, results in very low sound reproduction, and sometimes distortion and noise is heard. Also, these cheaper units cannot erase high bias or metal bias tapes. Attempting to do so will result in an incomplete erasure. This is due to the fact that the bias levels for high and metal position require greater levels.|$|E

50|$|Magnetic cards {{could be}} <b>write-protected,</b> and {{programs}} saved as private: once loaded back, the source code {{for the program}} could not be displayed. This made magnetic cards an obvious choice for program distribution.|$|R
50|$|Write-protection is {{typically}} {{enforced by the}} hardware. In the case of computer devices, attempting to violate it will return an error to the operating system while some tape recorders physically lock the record button when a <b>write-protected</b> cassette is present.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Notches on the {{top surface}} of the Compact Cassette {{indicate}} its type. The rear-most cassette {{at the top of}} this picture, with only <b>write-protect</b> notches (here covered by <b>write-protect</b> tabs), is Type I, its tape consisting of iron oxide. The next cassette down, with additional notches adjacent to the <b>write-protect</b> tabs, is Type II, its tape consisting of chrome and cobalt. The bottom two cassettes, featuring the Type II notches plus an additional pair in the middle of the cassette, are Type IV (metal); note the removal of the tabs on the second of these, meaning the tape is write-protected.|$|E

50|$|VHS-C {{cassettes}} have {{a switch}} to inhibit recording of a cassette. Not all adapters propagate {{the state of}} this switch to the VCR itself, so accidental erasure of a <b>write-protected</b> cassette is possible if the adapter's write protect lug or switch allows it.|$|R

50|$|Also, the tabs {{covering}} the <b>write-protect</b> notches of Loran cassettes were built-in plastic mechanisms that would open or close the notch {{by turning the}} mechanism with a small flat-blade screwdriver or a fingernail, {{as opposed to the}} <b>write-protect</b> tabs of other cassettes which were broken out instead, as the hardness of the Lexan would've made this very difficult for the average user to accomplish.|$|E
30|$|For the {{template}}-based work, some {{fields of}} the Use Case template in MS Word were <b>write-protected.</b> This protection was sometimes avoided by copying the template into a new document. Fortunately, this had no serious effect on meeting the template, but some fields needed small rework to meet the specifications on the template for the import into the UCMR.|$|R

The problems encountered when first implementing the setup and their solution are discussed. Finally, the setup is briefly compared to using a kernel-embedded root file system. ...|$|R
50|$|Another part of {{the copy}} {{protection}} involves {{an attempt by the}} program to modify the program disk itself on startup and render it unusable. On authentic game disks, this operation fails since the disks are <b>write-protected.</b> When playing the game using an emulator, it is advisable to set the read-only attribute for each disk image to avoid this modification.|$|R

50|$|Sometimes, the {{contents}} of a relatively slow ROM chip are copied to read/write memory to allow for shorter access times. The ROM chip is then disabled while the initialized memory locations are switched in on the same block of addresses (often <b>write-protected).</b> This process, sometimes called shadowing, is fairly common in both computers and embedded systems.|$|R
5000|$|Usually, on most filesystems, {{deleting}} a file requires write permission on {{the parent}} directory (and execute permission, {{in order to}} enter the directory in the first place). (Note that, confusingly for beginners, permissions on the file itself are irrelevant. However, GNU rm asks for confirmation if a <b>write-protected</b> file is to be deleted, unless the -f option is used.) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Software DSMs can be {{categorized}} into homeless and home-based systems both have strengths and weaknesses when compared to each other. This paper introduces optimization methods to exploit advantages and offset disadvantages of the home-based protocol in the home-based software DSM JIAJIA. The first optimization reduces the overhead of writes to home pages through a lazy home page write detection scheme. The normal write detection scheme <b>write-protects</b> shared pages {{at the beginning of}} a synchronization interval, while the lazy home page write detection delays home page <b>write-protecting</b> until the page is first fetched in the interval so that home pages that are not cached by remote processors do not need to be <b>write-protected.</b> The second optimization avoids fetching the whole page on a page fault through dividing a page into blocks and fetching only those blocks that are dirty with respect to the faulting processor. A write vector table is maintained for each shared page in its home to record for each processor which block(s) has been modified since the processor fetched the page last time. The third optimization adaptively migrates home of a page to the processor most frequently writes to the page to reduce twin and diff overhead. Migration information is piggybacked on barrier messages and no additional communication is required for the migration. Performance evaluation with some well-accepted benchmarks and real applications shows that the above optimization methods can reduce page faults, message amounts, and diffs dramatically and consequently improve performance significantly...|$|R
