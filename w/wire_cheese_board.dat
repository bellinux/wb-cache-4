50|$|The <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board</b> {{has helped}} launch other cooperatives {{throughout}} its history. In 1971 it bid {{and won the}} contract to operative the Swallow Collective Cafe in the Berkeley Art Museum, an entity initially staffed by <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board</b> members but eventually became its own cooperative business {{with as many as}} 30 members. In 1975 it funded and launched the Juice Bar Collective before similarly spinning off this operation. In 1976 the <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board</b> helped a member begin a cheese store on Donner Pass. In the 1980s, the <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board</b> contributed money and labor to a Bay Area cooperative network known as the Intercollective, a precursor to the present-day Network of Bay Area Worker Cooperatives. Through the Intercollective it funded the printing of a directory, map, and essays about local collectives, as well as a 1981 conference.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board</b> Collective in Berkeley, California, {{comprises}} two worker {{owned and}} operated businesses: a cheese shop/bakery {{commonly referred to as}} [...] "The Cheese Board", and a pizzeria known as [...] "Cheese Board Pizza". Along with Peet's Coffee, the <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board</b> is known for its role in starting the North Shattuck neighborhood of Berkeley {{on its way to becoming}} famous as a culinary destination: the [...] "Gourmet Ghetto". The <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board</b> brought a European focus on cheeses but also emphasized locally grown cheeses, a novel concept in the 1970s. The <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board</b> was closely connected with the restaurant Chez Panisse, helping to supply ingredients for the birth of California cuisine. The bakery brought the French baguette into vogue for Berkeley consumers, and helped spark a revolution in artisan bread.|$|R

50|$|The activist-oriented Berkeley Co-op {{grocery store}} {{was already in}} the neighborhood, {{focusing}} on natural foods. Also nearby were several neighborhood butcher shops which had survived the trend toward consumers buying pre-packaged meat in a grocery store. Into this mix, catering to European tastes in the manner of Peet's, the <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board</b> was founded a few doors down from Peet's in 1967 by academics Elizabeth and Sahag Avedisian who wanted to sell fine cheeses while they studied. The success of the business interrupted their studies, so the Avedisians sold the store to their six employees in 1971. The new enterprise was formed as an employee-owned collective and renamed the <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board</b> Collective. The <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board</b> also offered local cheeses, and they baked bread because the combination of bread and cheese was a classic. The sourdough baguette was introduced to the U.S. at the <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board</b> in 1975; it sold very well along with soft cheeses.|$|R
50|$|In 1990, {{a second}} semi-independent {{operation}} (which the members call an empowered committee), <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board</b> Pizza, {{was formed to}} produce pizza (originally sold as an occasional lunch and Friday night offering by the <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board</b> bakery) full-time. The pizzeria has thrived since then and often has a line out the door during lunch and dinner. <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board</b> Pizza is unusual in that only one type of pizza (always vegetarian) is made each day and no substitutions are allowed. Because the same product is continually being produced, customers always receive their pizza fresh from the oven without pre-ordering. Once a new pizza is ready, any remaining slices from the previous pizza are cut into slivers and given out as lagniappes. The <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board</b> staff tend to favor unconventional pizza toppings and use only fresh, seasonal produce. In 2007, <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board</b> Pizza renovated their shop and expanded into the space at 1512 Shattuck formerly occupied by University Plumbing and Hardware. The enlarged dining area seats significantly more people and allows faster service. The restaurant still has a piano and reserves floor space for the small jazz groups that often perform during peak hours. They often have special pizzas to celebrate occasions such as Bastille Day and Indian Independence Day.|$|R

50|$|Various non-knife {{devices are}} used for cutting cheese, such as a <b>wire</b> <b>cheese</b> cutter, which {{completely}} avoids adhesion, a cheese slicer, used primarily for thin slices of medium-hard cheeses, used especially in Scandinavia for cutting cheese for sandwiches, and the girolle, used to cut the hard Tête de Moine cheese by scraping.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1990s, after {{creating}} the <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board</b> Pizza, the collective continued its pattern of incubating new businesses, rather than expanding, {{by helping to}} create the Arizmendi Association of Cooperatives. This Association has replicated and refined three bakeries using the <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board's</b> recipes and organizational structure (in Oakland (1997), San Francisco (2000 and 2010), Emeryville (2003), and San Rafael (2010)). All six collectives are independently owned and operated, but share a technical support staff who provide financial, legal, and organizational services, and who are paid to continue replicating the model.

5000|$|When founded, {{the shop}} {{primarily}} sold cheese, but by 1975 the <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board</b> began {{to experiment with}} baking bread. Bread was originally produced in small quantities as an informal, impromptu sideline. Although bread sales were initially minor they marked a shift from a purely mercantile business model of buying and selling cheese to a mixed model that combines on-site, artisanal hand-production with domestic and import retail. The sale of baked goods grew rapidly, the baguette in particular. The <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board</b> popularized the baguette for U.S. customers. Bread now accounts for {{a significant portion of}} the store's business. As the sale of bakery products grew so did the variety of breads, pastries and other baked goods offered.

5000|$|The British <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board</b> {{claims that}} Britain has {{approximately}} 700 distinct local cheeses; France and Italy have perhaps 400 each.

Still, the advancement of the cheese art in Europe was slow during the centuries after Rome's fall. Many cheeses today were first recorded in the late Middle Ages or after—cheeses like Cheddar around 1500, Parmesan in 1597, Gouda in 1697, and Camembert in 1791.|$|R

50|$|On 25 October 1918, a {{fire started}} by {{lightning}} destroyed the factory, which was re-opened on 15 December 1919. By 1920, there were 5,000 sheep in the South Burnett compared to 230,000 beef and dairy cattle, with 10,000 pigs and 42,000 acres of crops. The Cactoblastis cactorum insect {{was introduced in}} 1923, and its defeat of the prickly pear enabled the Queensland dairy industry to rebuild and expand during the late 1920s, leading to the 1930s dairy boom. Also during the 1920s Butter and <b>Cheese</b> <b>Boards</b> were formed to equalise market prices, and the Nanango Co-operative Dairy Company became the Nanango Co-operative Dairy Association in 1924.

5000|$|Most cheeses were {{initially}} {{recorded in the}} late Middle Ages. Cheddar was recorded around 1500 CE, Parmesan was founded in 1597, Gouda in 1697, and Camembert in 1791. Cheeses diversified in Europe with locales developing their own traditions and products when Romanized populations encountered unfamiliar neighbors with their own cheese-making traditions. As long-distance trade collapsed, only travelers encountered unfamiliar cheeses. Charlemagne's first encounter with an edible rind white cheese forms one of the constructed anecdotes of Notker's Life of the Emperor. Cheese-making in manor and monastery intensified local characteristics imparted by local bacterial flora while the identification of monks with cheese is sustained through modern marketing labels. This also led to a diversity of cheese types. Today, Britain has 15 protected cheeses from approximately 40 types listed by the British <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board.</b> The British <b>Cheese</b> <b>Board</b> claims a total number of about 700 different products (including similar cheeses produced by different companies). France has 50 protected cheeses, Italy 46, and Spain 26. France also has at least 1,800 raw milk cheese products and probably more than 2,000 when including pasteurized cheese. Furthermore, French proverb states {{that there is a}} different French cheese for every day of the year. Late French general and statesman, Charles de Gaulle, once asked [...] "how can you govern a country in which there are 246 kinds of cheese?" [...] Meanwhile, the advancement of cheese art in Europe was slow during the centuries after Rome's fall. It became a staple of long-distance commerce, was disregarded as peasant fare, inappropriate on a noble table, and even harmful to one's health through the Middle Ages.|$|R
