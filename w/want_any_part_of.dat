While the pennant race caught fire, Manny Ramirez did not <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> it since the Red Sox did not offer him a {{sufficient}} contract for the 2009 season. As a result, Manny Ramirez went to the Los Angeles Dodgers in a three-way trade involving the Pittsburgh Pirates. The trade brought Jason Bay to the Red Sox. In September, the Rays held {{on to win the}} Eastern Division title with a 97–65 record. As for Boston, they won 95 games with a Wildcard berth. After defeating the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in the ALDS once again, they lost to the Rays in a seven-game ALCS.|$|E
25|$|The {{script that}} Cruise {{approved}} {{called for a}} final showdown to take place {{on top of a}} moving train. The actor wanted to use the famously fast French train the TGV but rail authorities did not <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the stunt performed on their trains. When that was no longer a problem, the track was not available. De Palma visited railroads on two continents trying to get permission. Cruise took the train owners out to dinner and the next day they were allowed to use it. For the actual sequence, the actor wanted wind that was so powerful that it could knock him off the train. Cruise had difficulty finding the right machine that would create the wind velocity that would look visually accurate before remembering a simulator he used while training as a skydiver. The only machine of its kind in Europe was located and acquired. Cruise had it produce winds up to 140 miles per hour so it would distort his face. Exterior shots of the train were filmed on the Glasgow South Western Line, between New Cumnock, Dumfries and Annan. Most of the sequence, however, was filmed on a stage against a blue screen for later digitizing by the visual effects team at Industrial Light & Magic.|$|E
500|$|The 1973–74 NBA {{season was}} to be West's last as a player. Now 36 years old, the veteran guard {{averaged}} 20.3points, 3.7rebounds and 6.6assists per game. In two newly introduced statistics, steals and blocks, he was credited with 2.6 steals and 0.7 blocks per game. Despite playing only 31 games due to a strained groin, West was still regarded as an elite guard, earning another callup into his final All-Star Game. Without Chamberlain, who had ended his NBA career, the Lakers won 47 games and lost in five games to the Milwaukee Bucks. After this loss, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages. West wanted to re-negotiate his contract and keep playing, however he said Cooke [...] "basically told my agent to go to hell. I felt I was deceived. When you feel that you’re deceived you don’t <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the organization that deceived you. I could’ve played another very good year. Every athlete says that. But I could’ve, and I knew I could’ve. But I could never have played for the Lakers again, and I wasn’t going to play for anybody else." [...] At {{the time of his}} departure, West had scored more points than any Laker in NBA history.|$|E

Jefferson did this for a time, but after the Kingpin was arrested and convicted for his crimes, and Jefferson offered a chance to be a full-fledged S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, he refused, not <b>wanting</b> <b>any</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> his brother's world.

Present were Cranston, DeConcini, Glenn, McCain, and additionally Riegle. The regulators felt that the meeting was very unusual and that they were being pressured by a united front, as the senators presented their reasons for having the meeting. DeConcini began the meeting by saying, [...] "We wanted to meet with you because we have determined that potential actions of yours could injure a constituent." [...] McCain said, [...] "One of our jobs as elected officials is to help constituents in a proper fashion. ACC [...] is a big employer and important to the local economy. I wouldn't want any special favors for them.... I don't <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> our conversation to be improper." [...] Glenn said, [...] "To be blunt, you should charge them or get off their backs," [...] while DeConcini said, [...] "What's wrong with this if they're willing to clean up their act? ... It's very unusual for us to have a company that could be put out of business by its regulators." [...] The regulators then revealed that Lincoln was under criminal investigation on a variety of serious charges, at which point McCain severed all relations with Keating.|$|E

500|$|Following Allen's {{failed attempt}} on St. John, {{many of his}} men drifted away, presumably drawn by the needs of home and farm. Arnold then began asserting his {{authority}} over Allen for control of Ticonderoga and Crown Point. Allen publicly {{announced that he was}} stepping down as commander, but remained hopeful that the Second Continental Congress was going to name [...] "a commander for this department ... Undoubtedly, we shall be rewarded according to our merit". Congress, for its part, at first not really <b>wanting</b> <b>any</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the affair, effectively voted to strip and then abandon the forts. Both Allen and Arnold protested these measures, pointing out that doing so would leave the northern border wide open. They both also made proposals to Congress and other provincial bodies for carrying out an invasion of Quebec. Allen, in one instance, wrote that [...] "I will lay my life on it, that with fifteen hundred men, and a proper artillery, I will take Montreal". Allen also attempted correspondence with the people of Quebec and with the Indians living there in an attempt to sway their opinion toward the revolutionary cause.|$|R

The first to do so was screenwriter Dudley Nichols (Best Writing in 1935 for The Informer). Nichols boycotted the 8th Academy Awards ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers' Guild. Actor/director/producer George C. Scott became the second person to refuse his award (Best Actor in 1970 for Patton) at the 43rd Academy Awards ceremony. Scott {{described it as a}} 'meat parade', saying 'I don't <b>want</b> <b>any</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> it." [...] The third was actor/director Marlon Brando, who refused his award (Best Actor for 1972's The Godfather), citing the film industry's discrimination and mistreatment of Native Americans.
