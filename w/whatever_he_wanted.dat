He was a very poor one, unable to get {{statements}} from people quoted in other papers, and eventually had greater success covering lectures around the city. He was promised a position at the Tribunes Sunday magazine when it launched, and he {{was moved to the}} magazine's staff soon after he was hired, eventually becoming chief writer. He wrote two articles a week: the first a review of non-literary books, the other a feature-style article about <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted.</b> The liberty gave his work new life, and the success of his pieces in the magazine convinced his editors to give him a signed byline column in the Tribune proper.|$|E

The game ended 1–1, with Peru winning 5–4 in the penalty shootout after Peruvian goalkeeper Hermoza saved the first penalty.|$|E

The award was $2,000 for one year, a significant amount of money at that time. He was able to further capitalize on the award by arranging to provide the editor of AAA Westway Magazine with 8-10 photos per month for $50 during their travels, with Wilson getting an additional $15 monthly for photo captions and short narratives. They purchased a new car and set out on Weston's dream trip to go and photograph <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted.</b> Over the next twelve months they made seventeen trips and covered 16,697 miles according to Wilson's detailed log.

500|$|The {{album is}} named after an {{incident}} at The Pump Room restaurant in Chicago, Illinois. Collins, entering the restaurant with former Led Zeppelin lead vocalist Robert Plant, was denied admittance {{because he did not}} meet the restaurant's dress code of [...] "jacket required" [...] for dinner while Plant was allowed in. Collins was wearing a jacket and argued about it. The maître d'hôtel argued that the jacket was not [...] "proper". Collins {{said in an interview with}} Playboy that he was, at that point, never so mad in his life. After the incident, the singer often appeared on shows such as Late Night with David Letterman and The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, denouncing the restaurant and telling his story. The management of the restaurant later sent him a complimentary sport coat and an apology letter, stating that he could come to the restaurant wearing <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted.</b>|$|E

Harrison adds that the song specifically espouses the message that [...] "we are not these bodies, we are in these material bodies in the physical world." [...] His friend Ravi Shankar once observed that Harrison exhibited tyagi, a trait meaning non-attachment or renunciation, a point to which Shankar added: [...] "He had everything – all the wealth, the fame, <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted.</b> But he was not attached to it... because he was searching for something much higher, much deeper. It does seem like he already had some Indian background in him [...]" [...] Harrison later said of life in the material world, referring to the need to break the cycle of rebirth associated with reincarnation: [...] "The whole point to being here, really, is to figure a way to get out." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{the music}} of Henry Cow was highly orchestrated and structured, Frith also began to {{experiment}} with unstructured music, using prepared instruments and chance composition. In June 1974, {{after the release of}} Henry Cow's second album, Virgin Records (Henry Cow's record label) commissioned a solo record from Frith. They were impressed with his musical ability and gave him free rein to record <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted.</b> In a 2001 radio interview, Frith said he used the opportunity as a challenge: [...] "I said to myself ... in two weeks time I'm going to go into the studio and I have no idea what I'm going to do and I'm going to kind of reinvent the instrument for myself." [...] Frith spent four days in July 1974 recording at the Kaleidophon Studios in London, and the resulting experimentation and the process of galvanisation and pressure led to the [...] "radical approach to the guitar" [...] on the album. In October 1974, Virgin released the album as Guitar Solos on their budget label, Caroline Records.|$|E

Kingpin is the murderer of Matt's father, and {{the man responsible for}} the hiring of Bullseye, with intention of having the Natchios family murdered. Michael Clarke Duncan signed on for the role in January 2002, though he had been attached far earlier. When Duncan was cast, he weighed 290 pounds. He was asked to gain 40 pounds for the role in order to fit the physique of Kingpin. In order to do this, he would lift weights for 30 minutes a day, and power-lifted with one or two reps a day, as well as eating <b>whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted.</b> Despite this, Duncan's biggest concern was that he is black, while Kingpin has always been portrayed as white.

500|$|Kubrick {{decided to}} make a short film {{documentary}} about boxer Walter Cartier, whom he had photographed and written about for Look magazine a year earlier. He rented a camera and produced a 16-minute black-and-white documentary, Day of the Fight. [...] Kubrick found the money independently to finance it. [...] He had considered asking Montgomery Clift to narrate it, whom he had met during a photographic session for Look, but settled on CBS news veteran Douglas Edwards. According to Paul Duncan the film was [...] "remarkably accomplished for a first film", and was notable for using the reverse tracking shot to film a scene in which the brothers walk towards the camera, a device later to become one of Kubrick's characteristic camera movements. Vincent Cartier, Walter's brother and manager, later reflected on his observations of Kubrick during the filming. [...] He said, [...] "Stanley was very stoic, impassive but imaginative type person with strong, imaginative thoughts. He commanded respect in a quiet, shy way. <b>Whatever</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted,</b> you complied, he just captivated you. Anybody who worked with Stanley did just what Stanley wanted". [...] After a score was added by Singer's friend Gerald Fried, Kubrick had spent $3900 in making it, and sold it to RKO-Pathé [...] for $4000, which was the most the company had ever paid for a short film at the time. [...] Kubrick described his first effort at filmmaking as having been valuable since he believed himself to have been forced to do most of the work, and he later declared that the [...] "best education in film is to make one".|$|E

However, the passageway was also a deadly trap, as the Dark One emerges as pure darkness, and almost kills Lancelot, but he eventually survives, after Guinevere uses a torch to repel the Darkness. This would lead to a kiss between Lancelot and Guinevere. The two walk through the doorway and discover the Dagger, but couldn't grab it thanks to a protection spell placed on it by Rumplestiltskin, who in exchange for the gauntlet, offered the magical sands of Avalon, which can be used to fix anything that appears to be [...] "broken" [...] at their choosing. Unfortunately, despite Lancelot's warning not to accept it, Guinevere decided to accept the deal and goes back to Arthur.

2500|$|At {{the time}} of the film's release, Bambi {{received}} mixed reviews from the critics, mainly {{because of the lack of}} fantasy elements in the film and objection towards a dramatic story of animals and their struggle to survive in the woods and avoid the threat of humans. Hunters spoke out against the movie, and in a 1942 edition of the magazine Outdoor Life, editor Raymond Brown wrote that the film was [...] "... the worst insult ever offered in any form to American sportsmen." [...] The New York Times claimed, [...] "In the search for perfection, Mr. Disney has come perilously close to tossing away his whole world of cartoon fantasy." [...] Film critic Manny Farber called it [...] "... entirely unpleasant ..." [...] and agreed with The New York Times statement saying, [...] "In an effort to trump the realism of flesh and blood movies, he [...] has given up fantasy, which was pretty much the magic element". Even Disney's daughter Diane complained, saying that Bambi's mother did not need to die.

[...] Lundgren and La Torre wanted to present a demo to the band that had already matured more into a song, which is why La Torre created a scratch drum part.

Rockenfield explained this, saying: [...] "They were so good that I kept them and translated them into what I would do."
