It {{was developed}} for Microsoft Windows personal computers using Eclipse Entertainment's open-source game engine Genesis3D along with the Reality Factory development kit. The source code was not substantially changed from the original. Instead, the developers simply plugged in images and sounds that they had created in freely available editing programs.|$|E
5|$|Biko saw white {{racism in}} South Africa as {{the totality of}} the <b>white</b> <b>power</b> structure. He argued that under apartheid, white people not only participated in the oppression of black people but were also the main voices in {{opposition}} to that oppression. He thus argued that in dominating both the apartheid system and the anti-apartheid movement, white people totally controlled the political arena, leaving black people marginalised. He believed white people were able to dominate the anti-apartheid movement because of their access to resources, education, and privilege. He noted that white South Africans were poorly suited to this role because they had not personally experienced the oppression that their black counterparts faced.|$|E
5|$|Following his graduation, Griffin {{became a}} {{political}} worker at the National Front headquarters. As a teenager he had accompanied {{his father to}} a National Front meeting, and by 1978, he was a national organiser for the party. He helped set up the White Noise Music Club in 1979, and several years later worked with <b>white</b> <b>power</b> skinhead band, Skrewdriver. In 1980, he {{became a member of}} the party's governing body, the National Directorate, and in the same year launched Nationalism Today with the aid of Joe Pearce, then editor of the NF youth paper Bulldog. As a National Front member, Griffin contested the seat of Croydon North West twice, in the 1981 by-election and 1983 general election, securing 1.2% and 0.9% of the vote.|$|E

He entered the <b>white</b> <b>power</b> music scene in 2000, becoming involved in several neo-Nazi bands.

25|$|Griffin's BNP also {{established}} an annual Red, White and Blue festival, {{which was based}} on the 'Blue Blanc Rouge' organised by France's National Front. The festival brought party activists together and aimed to promote a more family friendly image for the group, although it also provided a venue for <b>white</b> <b>power</b> skinhead bands like Stigger, Nemesis and Warlord. Around 1,000 BNP members attended the party's 2001 festival.|$|E
25|$|McCourt {{also became}} {{involved}} in the mod revival of 1978 and 1979. The mod fanzine Maximum Speed identified him as one of the faces of the period, as did later books on the mod revival. His photograph was featured on the album liner of Secret Affair's Glory Boys. McCourt wore the original skinhead and suedehead fashions of the late 1960s and early 1970s, which were quite different from the styles worn by many Oi! skinheads and <b>white</b> <b>power</b> skinheads of the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|McKeag's {{first group}} {{affiliation}} {{was with the}} <b>white</b> <b>power</b> skinhead gangs that existed on the Shankill and which were co-opted into the UDA's youth wing Ulster Young Militants. McKeag then became a born-again Christian and married young to a woman named Alison. His interest in Christianity would diminish as he became {{more involved in the}} UDA, whilst his marriage also broke up. Along with Adair and other younger figures, McKeag helped to fill the power vacuum left in the UDA by the deaths of John McMichael and Jim Craig and the departures of Andy Tyrie and Tommy Lyttle.|$|E
25|$|The 12 November 1976 {{issue of}} NME noted that Sham 69 was rehearsing in 1976, {{although}} only Pursey would remain from this early line-up twelve months later. Sham 69 {{did not have}} the art school background of many English punk bands of the time, and brought in football chant backup vocals and an implicit political populism. The band attracted a large skinhead following (left wing, right wing and non-political). Their concerts were plagued by violence, and the band ceased live performances after a 1979 concert at the Rainbow Theatre in Finsbury Park was broken up by National Front-supporting <b>white</b> <b>power</b> skinheads fighting and rushing the stage.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} several years of its existence, the union {{continued}} fighting the Pullman Company, its allies in the black community, the <b>white</b> <b>power</b> structure, and rival unions within the AFL that were hostile to its members' job claims. They also successfully fought efforts by communist to infiltrate the BSCP. The BSCP also tried to involve {{the federal government in}} its fight with the Pullman Company: on September 7, 1927 the brotherhood filed a case with the Interstate Commerce Commission, requesting an investigation of Pullman rates, porters' wages, tipping practices, and other matters related to wages and working conditions; the ICC ruled that it did not have jurisdiction.|$|E

25|$|In the UK, {{there were}} {{allegations}} {{of racism in}} football in both host countries. The main cause of discussion was the BBC current affairs programme Panorama, entitled Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate, which included recent footage of supporters chanting various antisemitic slogans and displays of <b>white</b> <b>power</b> symbols and banners in Poland, plus Nazi salutes and the beating of South Asians in Ukraine. The documentary was first echoed {{in much of the}} British press, but was then attacked for being one-sided and unethical: critics included other British media outlets; anti-racism campaigners, black and Jewish community leaders in Poland; Polish and Ukrainian politicians and journalists; England fans visiting the host nations and Gary Lineker, a British football star.|$|E
25|$|The {{main cause}} of {{discussion}} about the UEFA Euro 2012 football tournament in Poland and Ukraine was the BBC current affairs programme Panorama, called Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate. It included recent footage of supporters chanting various xenophobic slogans and displays of <b>white</b> <b>power</b> symbols and banners in Poland, and Nazi salutes and the beating of a few South Asians in Ukraine. The documentary was widely commented in the British press, but later criticised for being one-sided, sensationalist and unethical. The critics included other British media outlets, Polish anti-racism campaigners and black and Jewish community leaders in Poland, Polish and Ukrainian politicians and journalists, British fans visiting Poland and Ukraine and Gary Lineker.|$|E
25|$|British Asian Muslims faced {{discrimination}} and racism following Enoch Powell's Rivers of Blood {{speech and the}} establishment of the National Front in the late 1960s. This included overt racism in the form of Paki bashing, predominantly from <b>white</b> <b>power</b> skinheads, the National Front, and the British National Party, throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Drawing inspiration from the Indian independence movement, the black power movement, and the anti-apartheid movement, young British Pakistani and British Bangladeshi activists began a number of anti-racist Asian youth movements in the 1970s and 1980s, including the Bradford Youth Movement in 1977, the Bangladeshi Youth Movement following the murder of Altab Ali in 1978, and the Newham Youth Movement following the murder of Akhtar Ali Baig in 1980.|$|E

25|$|Lynchings were public {{demonstrations of}} <b>white</b> <b>power</b> and {{a means to}} exert social control. Racial {{tensions}} had an economic base. In attempting to reconstruct the plantation economy, planters were anxious to control labor. In addition, agricultural depression was widespread, {{and the price of}} cotton kept falling after the Civil War into the 1890s. A labor shortage occurred {{in many parts of the}} Deep South, most especially in the Mississippi Delta, which was being rapidly developed for agriculture. Southern attempts to recruit immigrant labor were unsuccessful, as immigrants would quickly leave field labor. Lynchings erupted when farmers tried to terrorize the laborers, especially when time came to settle and they were unable to pay wages, but tried to keep laborers from leaving.|$|E
25|$|The {{stated purpose}} of the ADL is to fight: anti-Semitism and all forms of bigotry (in the United States) and abroad, combat {{international}} terrorism, probe the roots of hatred, advocate before the United States Congress, {{come to the aid}} of victims of bigotry, develop educational programs, and serve as a public resource for government, media, law enforcement, and the public, all towards the goal of countering and reducing hatred.Historically, the ADL has opposed groups and individuals it considered to be anti-Semitic and/or racist, including: Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan, Henry Ford, Father Charles Coughlin (leader of the Christian Front), the Christian Identity movement, the German-American Bund, neo-Nazis, the American militia movement and <b>white</b> <b>power</b> skinheads (although the ADL acknowledges that there are also non-racist skinheads). The ADL publishes reports on a variety of countries, regarding alleged incidents of anti-Jewish attacks and propaganda.|$|E
25|$|Following on {{from the}} mod revival of the late 70s, the UK {{witnessed}} a revival of rude boy and skinhead fashion due to the popularity of ska punk, Oi! punk rock, rocksteady, and two tone music {{during the winter of}} discontent. In the early 80s, slim fitting mohair, tonic and houndstooth suits were popular, together with basket weave shoes, polo shirts, sta-prest trousers, Doc Martens, braces, Harrington jackets and pork pie hats popularized by bands like the Specials, UB40, the Bosstones, and Madness. In response to the racism of <b>white</b> <b>power</b> skinheads, 1980s rude boys wore checkerboard motifs to signify that both black and white people were welcome. Crew cuts and buzzcuts were worn by both sexes, and girls often incorporated hair bangs in a partially shaven style known as a Chelsea mohawk. In Brighton, the Skins of the 1980s fought the outlaw bikers and rockabilly guys, as the Mods and Rockers had previously done in the 60s.|$|E
