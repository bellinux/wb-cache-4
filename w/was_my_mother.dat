500|$|When Madonna {{started work}} on her fourth studio album, Like a Prayer, she was in an {{emotional}} state of mind following her divorce from Sean Penn, her 30th birthday and unfavorable reviews for her acting endeavors. She had certain personal matters on her mind that she thought could be the musical direction of the album. As Madonna considered her alternatives, producers Patrick Leonard and Stephen Bray experimented with instrumental tracks and musical ideas for her consideration. One day, while recording of the title track {{was going on at}} Jonny Yuma Studios, producer Patrick Leonard had to pick up his daughter Jessie from school and, since his wife was out of town, had to bring her back to the studio. Madonna, who was initially angry with Leonard for his late arrival, struck up a rapport with Jessie. She commented: [...] "It was like as if I <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and [...] was me. We were playing in our backyard again." [...] Witnessing their connection, Leonard approached Madonna with a song he had written for his daughter, titled [...] "Dear Jessie". Madonna changed some of the lyrics and agreed to record the track for Like a Prayer; it was finished within the next three days.|$|E

[...] "But my father thought I was a dreamer, I wasn't gonna amount to anything. It <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> who thought I was just reticent to do things. She would push me." ...|$|E
2500|$|As a boy, Schwarzenegger played several sports, heavily {{influenced}} by his father. He picked up his first barbell in 1960, when his soccer coach took his team to a local gym. At the age of 14, he chose bodybuilding over soccer as a career. He later said, [...] "I actually started weight training when I was 15, but I'd been participating in sports, like soccer, for years, so I felt that although I was slim, I was well-developed, at least enough so that I could start {{going to the gym}} and start Olympic lifting." [...] However, his official website biography claims that [...] "at 14, he started an intensive training program with Dan Farmer, studied psychology at 15 (to learn more about the power of mind over body) and at 17, officially started his competitive career". During a speech in 2001, he said, [...] "My own plan formed when I was 14 years old. My father had wanted me to be a police officer like he <b>was.</b> <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> wanted me to go to trade school." ...|$|E
