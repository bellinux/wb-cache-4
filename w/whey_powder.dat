40|$|The climates of {{many areas}} in Asia, Central America, the Middle East and Africa make it {{difficult}} to support a dairy industry based on fresh milk. In these areas the shelf life of fresh, undried milk products is short. Concentrated and dry milk products have increased storage stability because of a lower water activity and are therefore desirable in regions with such climatic conditions. Concentrated milk products are obtained from milk by the application of one or a combination of water removal techniques. Drying of these products can reduce the water content to below 3 %. The reduction in water content of milk will increase shelf life and reduce transportation costs. This is particularly important for manufacturers that export products to distant markets. These products may be recombined (water and a combination of ingredients added) or reconstituted (just water added) and then packed and sold by a food retailer, or sold directly to the consumer as a dry or concentrated product, e. g. whole milk powder (WMP) or canned evaporated milk.

40|$|Spray drying is a {{technique}} that is widely applied to produce dry powders from their liquid or slurry states in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Spray-dried forms of dairy powders may have several advantages, such as greater solubility, dissolution rates and surface areas. However, they are thermodynamically-unstable solids, which may undergo undesirable changes, such as caking after production. To overcome this problem, a fluidized-bed dryer {{has been used in}} this study to improve the degree of lactose crystallinity of sweet whey. It has been found that, with controlling the operating conditions in a continuous multi-stage fluidized bed dryer, <b>whey</b> <b>powders</b> can have different degrees of lactose crystallinity with reasonable overall processing times. However, crystalline powders may have some undesirable properties, such as lower dissolution rates. Thus, a new templating method has been developed to create spray-dried powders with high porosity and controlled characteristics, while maintaining the high stability of a crystalline powder. There were significant improvements in the surface areas. These engineered particles were then used as porous excipients in an adsorption technique to evaluate the potential of this technique for improvement of the dissolution characteristics of poorly water-soluble drugs and for content uniformity enhancement by incorporating the drug molecules onto this porous structure. Indomethacin, nifedipine, and acetaminophen as model drugs were studied. This method significantly improved the dissolution rate of these poorly water-soluble drugs due to the nanoconfinement of drug crystals inside the porous structure and the high solubility of porous mannitol. Tunable drug loadings have also been achieved with low variability for the drug content, indicating the ability of this method to produce highly-uniform blends...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{potentially}} {{negative effects}} of low molecular weight disaccharides, especially lactose, on spray-drying efficiency and storage stability of dairy powders are often counterbalanced {{by the presence of}} intact milk proteins. Hydrolysis of proteins, however, may impair such protective effects and contribute to a loss in production performance. Hydrolysed or non-hydrolysed whey protein/lactose (WP/L) dispersions were spray dried, in order {{to examine the effects of}} protein hydrolysis on relaxation behaviour and stickiness of model <b>powders.</b> <b>Whey</b> proteins included a non-hydrolysed, whey protein isolate control and three hydrolysed <b>whey</b> protein <b>powders</b> (WPH), with DH values of 8, 11 and 32, where DH = degree of hydrolysis. Hydrolysis of whey proteins increased moisture sorption in WP/L powders. Moisture sorption was higher in powders containing hydrolysed proteins. Whey proteins delayed the time-dependent onset of lactose crystallization, and this effect was greatest in powders containing WPH 32. Glass-rubber transition (T gr) temperatures of WP/L powders were not affected by protein hydrolysis but were dominated by the lactose fraction. <b>Powders</b> containing hydrolysed <b>whey</b> proteins were more susceptible to sticking compared to intact proteins. Surface coverage by proteins or peptides was lower in powders containing hydrolysed WP, and this would have contributed to the greater susceptibility of these powders to sticking. Results suggest that hydrolysis of WP affected the relaxation behaviour of WP/L powders and altered the rate at which lactose underwent viscous flow behaviour...|$|R

40|$|Protein {{structure}} {{affects the}} bioactivity and functionality of whey protein ingredients in food systems. Bioactivity of whey proteins and their derivatives are highly dependent upon primary, secondary and tertiary structure. The degree of denaturation of whey proteins {{is an important}} factor for determining how whey protein ingredients will perform in a food system. Several analytical methods have been developed to quantify protein denaturation of whey proteins. The goal of this project was to use a variety of analytical methods to quantify whey protein denaturation and to evaluate the correlation of denaturation to the functionality of <b>whey</b> protein <b>powders.</b> The objective of the first series of experiments was to compare three different analytical methods to measure denaturation of whey proteins in liquid whey obtained by various methods of separation and with varying degrees of heat treatment. A split plot experimental design was used. Raw bovine milk was skimmed and liquid whey was separated from the skim milk at natural pH. Three separation methods: 1) centrifugation, 2) membrane filtration and 3) enzyme coagulation, made up the first split plot. Each sub-plot of liquid whey was then divided into three split plots to receive heat treatment. Heat treatments were no heat, 76 °C for fifteen seconds and 85 °C for three minutes. Each of the resulting nine treatment combinations was analyzed by 1) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, 2) bicinchoninic acid-soluble protein assay and 3) fluorescence spectroscopy to determine the amount of denatured protein in the liquid whey. Fluorescence spectroscopy was found to be the most sensitive and reliable method for detecting differences in structure due to denaturation, while native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was found to be the least sensitive method. The sample which received the centrifugal treatment of isolation with no heat was found to be the most undenatured in structure while the sample which received the enzyme treatment of isolation with high heat was found to be the most denatured in structure. The objective of the second series of experiments was to evaluate the effect of denaturation on whey protein solubility in dried <b>whey</b> protein <b>powders.</b> Solubility {{is one of the most}} important functional properties to consider when selecting a whey protein ingredient, especially for beverage systems. Processing parameters are often manipulated in efforts to improve solubility. The protein structures of whey are considered to have an effect on solubility. Specifically, the degree of denaturation of whey proteins is thought to play a role in solubility. In this experimental design, raw bovine milk was skimmed and pasteurized then enzyme-coagulated at natural pH to separate the whey. Liquid whey was then split into three aliquots and each received one of the following treatments: 1) mild heat/ freeze dry, 2) mild heat/spray dry and 3) high heat/spray dry. Heat treatment was applied to liquid whey prior to concentration. Heat treated whey was then concentrated and dried. Powders were reconstituted and analyzed for denaturation using 1) bicinchoninic acid assay for soluble protein and 2) fluorescence spectroscopy and for solubility using an insolubility index. pH 4. 6 solubility and fluorescence spectroscopy for quantifying denaturation correlated well to one another. Both found that the low heat treated samples were less denatured in structure than the sample which received the high heat treatment, regardless of drying method. However, the drying method of the protein powders was correlated to solubility rather than heat treatment. A correlation of denaturation measured in <b>whey</b> protein <b>powders</b> and solubility was apparent for the low heat, freeze dried sample and the high heat, spray dried sample. Several conclusions were made in this research. 1) Centrifugal force causes less denaturation than membrane filtration and enzyme coagulation, thus unheated liquid whey obtained by centrifugal force can be used as a control in research on denaturation. 1) Fluorescence spectroscopy is a better method for quantifying denaturation in liquid and <b>powdered</b> <b>whey</b> compared to native PAGE and pH 4. 6 solubility measured by BCA. 3) Functional solubility is dependent on denaturation and can be correlated to analytical methods of measuring denaturation...|$|R
