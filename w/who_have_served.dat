50|$|The MOFW was {{patterned}} after the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS) {{which was a}} military society for officers, and their descendants, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>served</b> the Union during the American Civil War. As MOLLUS had restricted its membership to officers <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>served</b> in one particular war, the need was felt to have an organization for the descendants of officers <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>served</b> in the American Revolution, War of 1812 and the Mexican War - {{as well as the}} few surviving Mexican War veterans who were officers.|$|R

5|$|The other {{significant}} {{difference is that}} the Lutheran calendar commemorates a wider variety of individuals than does either of its counterparts. Included on the calendar are musicians and artists who are associated with the Church, but are not typically thought of as “saints” in the classical sense. The intent is to provide a wider venue for commemoration of outstanding individuals <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>served</b> the Church through their vocations rather than simply commemorating the outstanding among the religious.|$|E

5|$|After the war, the American and Philippines governments officially {{recognized}} some of {{the units}} and individuals who had fought against the Japanese, which led to benefits for the veterans but not all claims were upheld. There were 277 recognized guerrilla units out of over a thousand claimed and 260,715 individuals were recognized from nearly 1.3 million claims. These beneficiaries are only available to the guerrillas and veterans <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>served</b> for the Commonwealth, and doesn't include the brigand groups of the Huks and the Moros. Resistance leaders Wendell Fertig, Russell W.

5|$|In Belarus, {{the right}} to vote in {{elections}} and plebiscites is extended to those who are above the age of eighteen. During elections and plebiscites, a citizen can vote or not vote without any consequences from the government. The Constitution describes two methods of preventing a citizen from voting. First, a court can issue an order stating that the citizen does not have the mental capacity to understand and to cast a ballot. Second, a person being held in detention or confined in a prison during an election cannot cast a ballot. The Constitution says nothing about the voting rights of those <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>served</b> their prison terms, nor does it state how those citizens gain the rights back.|$|E

5|$|The state {{constitution}} of 1912 {{called for the}} election of a governor every two years. The term was increased to four years by a 1968 amendment. The constitution originally included no term limit, but an amendment passed in 1992 allows governors to succeed themselves only once; before this, four governors were elected more than twice in a row. Gubernatorial terms begin on the first Monday in the January following the election. Governors <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>served</b> the two term limit can run again after four years out of office.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 70 people <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>served</b> as governor, over 73 {{distinct}} terms. Additionally, Henry Molleston was elected, but died {{before he could}} take office.

5|$|In 1942, Saint Anselm {{became one}} of the {{institutions}} selected by the War Department for training of Army Aviation cadets. Thousands of young men were sent to the college to receive training and education before entering World War II. Cadets trained on large open fields which were located directly behind the present-day Coffee Shop. The U.S. government paid the college for training the cadets, and after the war, the college acquired two prefabricated government buildings which have been transformed into the modern-day coffee shop and bookstore. During World War II, several members of the monastic community served as Army chaplains; their names are inscribed on a monument in front of Alumni Hall dedicated to all graduates <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>served</b> in the armed forces. Also inscribed on the monument is the Latin and English versions of the Benedictine community's song. For more information see Saint Anselm Abbey Community Song.|$|E
5|$|Queen Victoria had {{instructed}} the War Office {{to strike a}} new medal that would not recognise birth or class. The medal {{was meant to be}} a simple decoration that would be highly prized and eagerly sought after by those in the military services. To maintain its simplicity, Queen Victoria, under the guidance of Prince Albert, vetoed the suggestion that the award be called The Military Order of Victoria and instead suggested the name Victoria Cross. The original warrant stated that the Victoria Cross would only be awarded to soldiers <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>served</b> in the presence of the enemy and had performed some signal act of valour or devotion. The first ceremony was held on 26 June 1857 at which Queen Victoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in a ceremony in Hyde Park, London.|$|E

The {{original}} version of this monument was in Port Said in Egypt, and was mostly destroyed during the 1956 Suez War.
