40|$|AbstractBackgroundChildren’s {{growth is}} {{conditioned}} by genetic, environmental, {{social and economic}} factors. Therefore, {{it is useful to}} construct growth charts locally. The Fundación Cardio-Infantil, Instituto de Cardiología, and the Asociación Colombiana de Endocrinología Pediátrica (ACEP), {{with the support of the}} Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and Colciencias, are developing the normative growth standards which will evaluate the expression of biological potential for Colombian children. ObjectiveTo establish reference anthropometric/auxological data for children and adolescents living in Bogotá, Medellín, Cali and Barranquilla, and to develop reference growth charts for the Colombian population. MethodsCross-sectional study (except in the first year of life, when it will be longitudinal) in four large cities in Colombia (Bogotá, Medellín, Cali and Barranquilla). Boys and girls from 0 to 20 years of age, healthy, from strata 3 and higher (middle to upper class, in order to limit factors that could inhibit the expression of biological potential), are going to be included. Exclusion criteria are any condition (including medications) affecting growth, and if both parents are foreigners. Twenty six thousands five hundred (250 boys and 250 girls for each age group) are to be included. Participants are to be selected using two-stage, stratified probabilistic sampling of elements. Anthropometric measurements are height, weight, head <b>circumference,</b> <b>waist</b> <b>circumference,</b> and <b>sitting</b> height. Reference standard deviations as well as percentile curves will be estimated, reporting the distribution change with three curves (median, coefficient of variation and skewness coefficient) ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Dyslipidemia is {{recognized}} as {{a major cause of}} coronary heart disease (CHD). Emerged evidence suggests that the combination of triglycerides (TG) and <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> can be used to predict the risk of CHD. However, considering the known limitations of TG, non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL = Total cholesterol - HDL cholesterol) cholesterol and <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> model may be a better predictor of CHD. PURPOSE: The Framingham Offspring Study data were used to determine if combined non-HDL cholesterol and <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> is equivalent to or better than TG and <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> (hypertriglyceridemic <b>waist</b> phenotype) in predicting risk of CHD. METHODS: A total of 3, 196 individuals from Framingham Offspring Study, aged ~ 40 years old, who fasted overnight for ~ 9 hours, and had no missing information on nonHDL cholesterol, TG levels, and <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> measurements, were included in the analysis. Receiver Operator Characteristic Curve (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC) was used to compare the predictive ability of non-HDL cholesterol and <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> and TG and <b>waist</b> <b>circumference.</b> Cox proportional-hazards models were used to examine the association between the joint distributions of non-HDL cholesterol, <b>waist</b> <b>circumference,</b> and non-fatal CHD; TG, <b>waist</b> <b>circumference,</b> and non-fatal CHD; and the joint distribution of non-HDL cholesterol and TG by <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> strata, after adjusting for age, gender, smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes, and hypertension status. RESULTS: The ROC AUC associated with non-HDL cholesterol and <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> and TG and <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> are 0. 6428 (CI: 0. 6183, 0. 6673) and 0. 6299 (CI: 0. 6049, 0. 6548) respectively. The difference in the ROC AVC is 1. 29 %. The p-value testing if the difference in the ROC AVCs between the two models is zero is 0. 10. There was a strong positive association between non-HDL cholesterol and the risk for non-fatal CHD within each TO levels than that for TO levels within each level of nonHDL cholesterol, especially in individuals with high <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> status. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that the model including non-HDL cholesterol and <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> may be superior at predicting CHD compared to the model including TO and <b>waist</b> <b>circumference...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Visceral {{obesity is}} {{positively}} related to insulin resistance. The {{nature of the relationship}} between <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> and insulin resistance has not been known in Japanese populations. This study examined the relationship between <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> and insulin resistance and evaluated the optimal cutoff point for <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> in relation to insulin resistance in middle-aged Japanese men. Methods Study subjects included 4800 Japanese men aged 39 to 60 years. Insulin resistance was evaluated by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). The relationship of <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> with HOMA-IR was assessed by use of adjusted means of HOMA-IR and odds ratios of elevated HOMA-IR defined as the highest quintile (≥ 2. 00). Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis using Youden index and the area under curve (AUC) was employed to determine optimal cutoffs of <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> in relation to HOMA-IR. Results Adjusted geometric means of HOMA-IR and prevalence odds of elevated HOMA-IR were progressively higher with increasing levels of <b>waist</b> <b>circumference.</b> In the ROC curve analysis, the highest value of Youden index was obtained for a cutoff point of 85 cm in <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> across different values of HOMA-IR. Multiple logistic regression analysis also indicated that the AUC was consistently the largest for a <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> of 85 cm. Conclusion <b>Waist</b> <b>circumference</b> is linearly related to insulin resistance, and 85 cm in <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> is an optimal cutoff in predicting insulin resistance in middle-aged Japanese men. </p...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} weight and body composition changes on waist measurement of severely obese women receiving a low-carbohydrate diet for a short-term. METHODS: Nineteen severely obese women divided into an intervention and a control group received a low-carbohydrate diet and a conventional diet, respectively, both with 1, 200 kcal, for seven days. Anthropometric measurements such as weight, body mass index, arm <b>circumference,</b> <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> (at the navel), two proposed measurements of <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> (<b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> 1, 10 cm above the navel; and <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> 2, 20 cm above the navel), hip circumference; and body composition (lean mass and fat mass) were performed at baseline {{and end of the}} study. RESULTS: There was significant reduction of all variables in the intervention group (p< 0. 01), but the control group had no change in <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> (p= 0. 06) and hip circumference (p= 0. 36). Patients of the intervention group presented greater weight loss (4. 4 kg, p< 0. 01) and reduction of body mass index, <b>waist</b> <b>circumference,</b> <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> 1, <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> 2 (p< 0. 01), and fat mass (p= 0. 04) than the control group. CONCLUSION: The weight loss and body composition changes were greater in the low-carbohydrate group than in the conventional-diet group, and they had a greater impact on waist measurements. The proposed measurements (<b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> 1 and <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> 2) were sensitive to weight reduction in both groups...|$|R
40|$|To date, it {{is unknown}} whether <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> can be {{measured}} validly and reliably when a subject is in a supine position. This issue is relevant when international standards for healthy participants are applied to persons with severe intellectual, sensory, and motor disabilities. Thus, the aims of our study were (1) to determine the validity of <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> measurements obtained in a supine position, (2) to formulate an equation that predicts standing <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> from measurements obtained in a supine position, and (3) to determine the reliability of measuring <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> in persons with severe intellectual, sensory, and motor disabilities. First, we performed a validity study in 160 healthy participants, in which we compared <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> obtained in standing and supine positions. We also conducted a test-retest study in 43 participants with severe intellectual, sensory, and motor disabilities, in which we measured the <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> with participants in the supine position. Validity was assessed with paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. A prediction equation was estimated with multiple regression analysis. Reliability was assessed by Wilcoxon signed rank test, limits of agreement (LOA), and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). Paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed rank test revealed significant differences between standing and supine <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> measurements. We formulated an equation to predict <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> (R(2) = 0. 964, p < 0. 001). There {{were no significant differences}} between test and retest <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> values in disabled participants (p = 0. 208; Wilcoxon signed rank test). The LOA was 6. 36 cm, indicating a considerable natural variation at the individual level. ICC was. 98 (p < 0. 001). We found that the validity of supine <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> is biased towards higher values (1. 5 cm) of standing <b>waist</b> <b>circumference.</b> However, standing <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> can be predicted from supine measurements using a simple prediction equation. This equation allows the comparison of supine measurements of disabled persons with the international standards. Supine <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> can be reliably measured in participants with severe intellectual, sensory, and motor disabilities. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

Objectives: To {{discern the}} {{correlation}} between <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> and waist-to-hip ratio with serum fasting glucose level on men {{as well as their}} possible predictive value. Method: This was an analytic-observational study with cross-sectional approach. Subjects were male population of Desa Ngoresan and Ngemplak Sutan, Jebres, Surakarta with age of 30 - 50 years old. As many as 43 subjects were selected by incidental sampling method based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The measurement of <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> and hip circumference (with 1 mm proximity) as well as blood samples collection were performed on every subject. The waist-to-hip ratios calculations and serum fasting glucose level measurements were performed afterward. The collected data were analyzed by using Normality, Bivariate and Multivariate Tests. Result: Bivariate test showed correlation between <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> and waist-to-hip ratio with serum fasting glucose level (r= 0. 522; p< 0. 05 and r= 0. 333, p< 0. 05; respectively).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{body mass}} index (BMI), waist-hip ratio (WHR) and <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> as {{predictors}} of all-cause mortality among the elderly. DESIGN: Population-based cohort study; mean follow-up was 5. 4 y. SETTING: The Rotterdam Study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 6296 men and women; baseline age 55 - 102 y. MEASUREMENTS: Sex-specific all-cause mortality was compared between quintiles of BMI, WHR and <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> and between predefined categories of BMI and <b>waist</b> <b>circumference,</b> stratified for smoking category. RESULTS: High quintiles of <b>waist</b> <b>circumference,</b> but not high quintiles of BMI and WHR were related to increased mortality among never smoking men, without reaching statistical significance. Only the highest category of BMI (BMI > 30 kg/m 2) among never smoking men was related to increased mortality, compared to normal BMI (hazard ratio 2. 6 (95 % confidence interval: 1. 3 - 5. 3)). <b>Waist</b> <b>circumference</b> between 94 and 102 cm and <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> 102 cm and larger were related to increased mortality, compared to normal <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> (hazard ratios 1. 7 (95 % confidence interval 1. 1 - 2. 8) and 1. 6 (95 % confidence interval 1. 0 - 2. 8), respectively).

Our second objective {{was to examine the}} respective contribution of <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> and physical inactivity on coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. Design: Prospective, population-based study with an 11. 4 -year follow-up. Subjects: A total of 21 729 men and women aged 45 - 79 years, residing in Norfolk, UK. Methods: During follow-up, 2191 CHD events were recorded. Physical activity was evaluated using a validated lifestyle questionnaire that takes into account both leisure-time and work-related physical activity. <b>Waist</b> <b>circumference</b> was measured and BMI was calculated for each participant. Results: For both men and women, we observed that within each BMI category (= 30. 0 kg m(- 2)), active participants had a lower <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> than inactive participants (P < 0. 001). In contrast, within each <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> tertile, BMI did not change across physical activity categories (except for women with an elevated <b>waist</b> <b>circumference).</b> Compared with active men with a low <b>waist</b> <b>circumference,</b> inactive men with an elevated <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> had a hazard ratio (HR) for future CHD of 1. 74 (95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 34 - 2. 27) after adjusting for age, smoking, alcohol intake and parental history of CHD. In the same model and after further adjusting for hormone replacement therapy use, compared with active women with a low <b>waist</b> <b>circumference,</b> inactive women with an elevated <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> had an HR for future CHD of 4. 00 (95 % CI, 2. 04 - 7. 86).

40|$|Background: in {{the general}} population, <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> was noted to be a {{reliable}} predictor of visceral fat. in addition, increased <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> was strongly associated with risk factors for cardiovascular disease. in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the association of <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> with visceral fat was never tested. Study Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting & Participants: 122 patients with CKD not yet on dialysis therapy (75 men; diabetes mellitus, 30 %; age, 55. 3 +/- 11. 3 years; body mass index, 27. 1 +/- 5. 2 kg/m(2); estimated glomerular filtration rate, 35. 4 +/- 15. 2 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2)) were studied. Predictor: <b>Waist</b> <b>circumference.</b> Outcomes & Measurements: Anthropometry, abdominal visceral fat measured by means of computed tomography, and cardiovascular disease risk factors. Results: <b>Waist</b> <b>circumference</b> strongly correlated with visceral fat (r = 0. 75 for men, r = 0. 81 for women; P < 0. 01). K Statistic was 0. 56, indicating relatively good agreement between methods. Body mass index showed a lower correlation coefficient (r = 0. 68 for men, r = 0. 76 for women; P < 0. 01) and poor agreement (0. 36) with visceral fat in comparison to <b>waist</b> <b>circumference.</b> in men, <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> and visceral fat similarly correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, triacylglycerol level, and Homeostasis Model Assessment Index (P < 0. 05). in women, <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> correlated with age, C-reactive protein level, and Homeostasis Model Assessment Index, whereas visceral fat also correlated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triacylglycerol levels (P < 0. 05). Limitations: Findings are restricted to patients with CKD not yet on dialysis therapy from a single center. Conclusions: <b>Waist</b> <b>circumference</b> was strongly associated with visceral fat in patients with CKD.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} {{independent}} effect of <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> on mortality {{across the entire}} body mass index (BMI) range and to estimate the loss in life expectancy related to a higher <b>waist</b> <b>circumference.</b> PATIENTS AND METHODS: We pooled data from 11 prospective cohort studies with 650, 386 white adults aged 20 to 83 years and enrolled from January 1, 1986, through December 31, 2000. We used proportional hazards regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % CIs for the association of <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> with mortality. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 9 years (maximum, 21 years), 78, 268 participants died. After accounting for age, study, BMI, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and physical activity, a strong positive linear association of <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> with all-cause mortality was observed for men (HR, 1. 52 for <b>waist</b> <b>circumferences</b> of ≥ 110 vs < 90 cm; 95 % CI, 1. 45 - 1. 59; HR, 1. 07 per 5 -cm increment in waist circumference; 95 % CI, 1. 06 - 1. 08) and women (HR, 1. 80 for <b>waist</b> <b>circumferences</b> of ≥ 95 vs < 70 cm; 95 % CI, 1. 70 - 1. 89; HR, 1. 09 per 5 -cm increment in waist circumference; 95 % CI, 1. 08 - 1. 09). The estimated decrease in life expectancy for highest vs lowest <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> was approximately 3 years for men and approximately 5 years for women. The HR per 5 -cm increment in <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> was similar for both sexes at all BMI levels from 20 to 50 kg/m(2), but it was higher at younger ages, higher for longer follow-up, and lower among male current smokers. The associations were stronger for heart and respiratory disease mortality than for cancer. CONCLUSIONS: In white adults, higher <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> was positively associated with higher mortality {{at all levels of}} BMI from 20 to 50 kg/m(2). <b>Waist</b> <b>circumference</b> should be assessed in combination with BMI, even for those in the normal BMI range, as part of risk assessment for obesity-related premature mortality.

Mean, unadjusted levels of <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> increased by 3. 7 cm (boys) and 6. 0 cm (girls) from 1988 - 94 through 2011 - 12, while mean BMI levels increased by 1. 1 kg/m 2 (boys) and 1. 6 kg/m 2 (girls). Overall, the proportional changes in mean levels of both <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> and BMI were fairly similar among boys (5. 3 %, waist vs. 5. 6 %, BMI) and girls (8. 7 %, waist vs. 7. 7 %, BMI). As assessed by the area under the curve, adjustment for BMI reduced the secular increases in <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> by about 75 % (boys) and 50 % (girls) beyond that attributable to age and race-ethnicity.

40|$|ALT and <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> {{are both}} {{correlated}} to insulin resistance (IR). Objective: To determine whether ALT provides information {{in addition to}} <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> for identifying IR. Methods: IR was defined by HOMA-IR index ≥ 3. In this Europid population, a <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> ≥ 80 cm in women and ≥ 94 cm in men was considered excessive. Elevated ALT was defined using either the usual cut-off or updated cut-offs of 19 U/l in women and 30 U/l in men. Results: 288 participants without medication affecting insulin concentration were included. 81 (28 %) were insulin resistant, 30 (10 %) and 98 (34 %) had increased ALT using usual and updated cut-offs, respectively, and 218 (76 %) had excessive <b>waist</b> <b>circumference.</b> Among subjects with normal <b>waist</b> <b>circumference,</b> IR was as frequent in participants with normal ALT as in those with increased ALT. Among subjects with excessive <b>waist</b> <b>circumference,</b> IR was less frequent in participants with normal ALT according to the usual cut-off (31 % vs. 56 %, p= 0. 01), and tended to be less frequent in participants with normal ALT according to updated cut-offs (29 % vs. 41 %, p= 0. 07) than in those with increased ALT. Conclusion: ALT is useful for identifying IR only if <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> is excessive. In subjects with excessive <b>waist</b> <b>circumference,</b> IR is present in more than 40 % in women with ALT > 19 U/l and in men with ALT > 30 U/l, and in more than 50 % in individuals with ALT > 45 U/l.

40|$|Body Mass Index (BMI) is {{the most}} {{established}} anthropometric indicator used for assessment of nutritional status. Other anthropometric indicators which are related closely to BMI are waist hip ratio (WHR) and <b>waist</b> <b>circumference.</b> In this paper, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were constructed to assess the value of <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> and <b>waist</b> hip ratio as a screening measure for the need of weight management using BMI as the reference test. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated at several cut-offs. The areas under the ROC curve calculated by comparing <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> with BMI were high (0. 70 - 0. 86) while the areas calculated for WHR were low (0. 46 - 0. 67).

Not known are the optimal cut point values for central and visceral adiposity to identify Japanese Americans at risk for the metabolic syndrome. RESEARCHDESIGNANDMETHODS — Study subjects included 639 Japanese Amer-icans. The nonadipose variables of the metabolic syndrome were defined using modified Inter-national Diabetes Federation criteria, and the accuracy of identifying at least two of these by intra-abdominal fat area (IAFA) as measured by computed tomography and <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> was cross-sectionally assessed using area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The values for IAFA and <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> that resulted in maximizing the Youden index were defined as “optimal. ” RESULTS — The area under the ROC curve for IAFA exceeded that for <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> (men 0. 787 vs. 0. 686; women 0. 792 vs. 0. 721). For women, the optimal cut points for IAFA and <b>waist</b> <b>circumference</b> were 51. 5 cm 2 and 80. 8 cm (age 56 years) and 86. 3 cm 2 and 89. 0 cm (age 56 years).
