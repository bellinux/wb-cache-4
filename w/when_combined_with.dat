5|$|Historian Nancy Bristow {{has argued}} that the pandemic, <b>when</b> <b>combined</b> <b>with</b> the {{increasing}} number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This was {{due in part to the}} failure of medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness. Nursing staff, who were predominantly women, felt more inclined to celebrate the success of their patient care and less inclined to identify the spread of the disease with their own work.|$|E
5|$|In February 1996, Bisceglie {{provided}} {{a copy of}} the 1971 essay written by Ted Kaczynski to the FBI.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{possible}} {{implications of the}} discreteness of spacetime, which is defined here as {{the existence of a}} minimum observable interval of spacetime. First, it is argued that the discreteness of spacetime may result in the existence of a finite invariant speed <b>when</b> <b>combining</b> <b>with</b> the principle of relativity. Next, it is argued that <b>when</b> <b>combining</b> <b>with</b> the uncertainty principle, the discreteness of space seems to require that spacetime is curved by matter, and the dynamical relationship between matter and spacetime holds true not only for macroscopic objects but also for microscopic particles. Moreover, the Einstein gravitational constant can also be determined in terms of the minimum size of discrete spacetime. Thirdly, it is argued that the discreteness of time may result in the dynamical collapse of the wave function, and the minimum size of discrete spacetime also yields a plausible collapse criterion consistent with experiments. These heuristic arguments might provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} special and general relativity and quantum theory, and also have implications for the solutions to the measurement problem and the problem of quantum gravity...|$|R
5000|$|Kinky - {{a yellow}} Ghost that only {{appeared}} in Pac-Man Arrangement. He is also called Kinzo. Kinky is the scientist of the Ghosts {{who has the}} ability to <b>combine</b> <b>with</b> other Ghosts. <b>When</b> he <b>combines</b> <b>with</b> Clyde (note: in Pac-Man Arrangement, Clyde was the red ghost and Blinky was orange), Kinky becomes a bull-like ghost named Urchin that can charge after Pac-Man. <b>When</b> he <b>combines</b> <b>with</b> Inky, Kinky's glasses appear on Inky's body and grant this new combined ghost (named Stylist) the ability to split in two. Stylist's reflection will mirror Stylist's movements on {{the other half of the}} map (about the vertical axis). <b>When</b> Kinky <b>combines</b> <b>with</b> Pinky, the resulting ghost is rabbit-like and named Romp. Romp can hop to any part of the map, usually very close to Pac-Man's position. The combination of Kinky and Blinky (who is orange in Pac-Man Arrangement) results in Crybaby, a chubbier version of Blinky who adds 20-point Pac-Dots to the maze.|$|R

It cut off the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas {{from the rest of}} the Confederate States, effectively splitting the Confederacy in two for the duration of the war. The Union victory also permanently severed communication between the balance of the Confederacy and the Trans-Mississippi Department.|$|E
