5000|$|On 29 August 1782, the Royal George {{was being}} heeled off Portsmouth to allow repairs {{to be made}} to the water intake for the deck <b>wash</b> <b>pump,</b> which was three feet below water level. The {{larboard}} guns had been run out and the starboard guns moved into the centre of the deck to heel over the ship until her lowest gun ports were close {{to the surface of the}} water. A supply vessel, the Lark approached the Royal George on her low side to transfer a cargo of rum. According to an Admiralty report - not made public until early the next century - the larboard cannons' weight on the ship's central frame caused excessively decayed timbers to break. This caused the ship to heel to such a degree that the sea washed in at her gunports, and she soon began to ship water in her hold. A sudden breeze on the raised side of the ship forced her further over and the water rushed in. The crew were ordered to right the ship but the fallen cannon could not be moved. Within a couple of minutes she rolled on to her side and sank before any distress signal could be given.Nine hundred people were estimated to have lost their lives, for besides the crew there were a large number of tradesmen and women and children on board. About 230 people were saved, some by running up the rigging, while others were picked up by boats from other vessels. Kempenfelt was writing in his cabin when the ship sank; the cabin doors had jammed due to the ship heeling, and he perished with the rest. William Cowper's poem, the [...] "Loss of the Royal George", commemorates this disaster. Kempenfelt had effected radical alterations and improvements in the signalling system then existing in the British navy. A painting of the loss of the Royal George is in the Royal United Service Institution, London.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, high {{importance}} {{is given to}} low energy devices (such as refrigerators, deep-freezers, <b>washing</b> machines, <b>pumps,</b> etc. ) {{that are able to}} produce reactive power in power lines which can be optimized (reduced). Reactive power is the main component which overloads power lines and brings excessive thermal stress to conductors. If the reactive power is optimized, it can significantly lower the electricity consumption (from 10 to 30 %—varies between countries). This paper will examine and discuss the development of a measuring device for analyzing reactive power. However, the main problem is the precise real time measurement of the input and output voltage and current. Such quality measurement is needed to allow adequate action intervention (feedback which reduces or fully compensates reactive power). Several other issues, such as the accuracy and measurement speed, must be examined while designing this device.

40|$|Introduction When {{drilling}} an oil well, {{the well}} is lined by sinking a steel casing, or liner, into the drilling mud (see Figure 1). The {{inside of the}} liner forms a central pipe, and leaves an annular gap between {{the outside of the}} liner and the surrounding rock. The inside and outside of the liner are initially filled with drilling mud, which is displaced by pumping a sequence of fluids down inside the liner from the surface. Typically, a chemical <b>wash</b> is <b>pumped</b> down first, followed by a spacer, and finally a cement slurry. The wash, which is usually water based, is less dense than the spacer, a water-based suspension, which is itself less dense than the cement slurry. The scenario of a light wash being forced down a pipe by a denser spacer fluid is liable to instabilities of Rayleigh [...] Taylor type. The two fluids are miscible, so mixing between the wash and the spacer is likely to take place. This may impair the intended efficiency of the wash in displacing mud from the wall...|$|R

This included collecting weighted composited sam-ples of the egg washer overflow and sump contents, continual overflow from the egg breaker and flushing of vats, tanks, strainers, piping and pasteurizer.
