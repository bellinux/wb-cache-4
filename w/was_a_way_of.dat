The funeral ale <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> socially demarcating the case of death. It was only after drinking the funeral ale that the heirs could rightfully claim their inheritance.

5|$|Wife {{selling in}} England <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> ending an {{unsatisfactory}} marriage {{by mutual agreement}} that probably {{began in the late}} 17th century, when divorce was a practical impossibility for all but the very wealthiest. After parading his wife with a halter around her neck, arm, or waist, a husband would publicly auction her to the highest bidder. Wife selling provides the backdrop for Thomas Hardy's novel The Mayor of Casterbridge, in which the central character sells his wife {{at the beginning of the}} story, an act that haunts him for the rest of his life, and ultimately destroys him.|$|E

Not whole poetic pieces but {{a part of}} classics were quoted and recited by individuals usually followed by a chorus. Fujiwara no Kintō (966–1041) compiled Wakan rōeishū ("Sino-Japanese Anthology for Rōei", ca. 1013) from Japanese and Chinese poetry works written for roei. One or two lines were quoted in Wakan rōeishū and those quotations were grouped into themes like Spring, Travel, Celebration.|$|E
25|$|The Vickers-Wibault {{construction}} {{method was}} based on the patents of Michel Wibault, who began working with Vickers in 1922. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> producing an all-metal aircraft with an airframe built up from simple, non-machined metal shapes, covered with very thin e.g. 0.016 in (0.4mm) corrugated light alloy sheets. Skin panels were riveted {{to each other and to}} the underlying structure; the skin on the wings was not stressed. Vickers' first experience of the method was with the licence built Wibault Scout. The first Vickers design using this construction was the Vireo and the third, the Viastra, used a blend of Wibault and Vickers construction techniques.|$|E

25|$|The Great Parlour was {{the most}} {{important}} room in the early 17th century. According to the inventory of 1611 it had the best furniture, and contained the Batts' collection of maps. In the 1630s the Batts added a magnificent plaster ceiling and painted the oak panelling including a landscape scene above the fireplace. Most of the original panels have survived. The painting technique known as scumbling <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> decorating to create an air of warmth and grandeur. Few examples of this decorative work survive today. In the late 17th century, dining rooms and parlours were the preferred rooms for eating and entertaining guests in private.

Elections were scheduled to reunify the country in 1956, but Diệm refused to hold them, claiming that a free election was not possible in the North. According to Taylor, the rejection of Diệm of the Geneva accord <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> objecting to the French colonialism of Vietnam. Diệm's disposition over Bảo Đại and the establishment of the First Republic of Vietnam was a way to claim Vietnamese independence from France. At the same time, the first Constitution of Republic of Vietnam was promulgated. According to the Constitution, Diệm had almost absolute power over South Vietnam. His governance style became increasingly dictatorial over time.|$|E
25|$|It was Suzuki's {{contention}} that a Zen satori (awakening) was {{the goal of}} the tradition's training, but that what distinguished the tradition as it developed through the centuries in China <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> life radically different from that of Indian Buddhists. In India, the tradition of the mendicant (holy beggar, bhikku in Pali) prevailed, but in China social circumstances {{led to the development of}} a temple and training-center system in which the abbot and the monks all performed mundane tasks. These included food gardening or farming, carpentry, architecture, housekeeping, administration (or community direction), and the practice of folk medicine. Consequently, the enlightenment sought in Zen had to stand up well to the demands and potential frustrations of everyday life.|$|E

25|$|After the {{execution}} of Philotas (330 BC), Hephaestion was appointed joint commanderwith Cleitusof the Companion cavalry, Philotas' former position. This dual appointment <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> satisfying two divergent shades of opinion now hardening throughout the army: one, like Hephaestion, broadly supportive of Alexander's policy of integration, and the other, that of Philip's older veterans in particular, whose implacable resentment of Persian ways was well represented by Cleitus. The cavalry prospered under this command, showing itself equal to learning new tactics necessary against Scythian nomads and to counter-insurgency measures such as those deployed {{in the spring of}} 328 BC. The army set out from Balkh in five columns to spread through the valleys between the Oxus and Tanais rivers to pacify Sogdiana. Hephaestion commanded one of the columns and, after arriving at Marakanda, he set out again to establish settlements in the region.|$|E
25|$|At {{times and}} places of poor public {{sanitation}} (such as Medieval Europe), the consumption of alcoholic drinks <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> avoiding water-borne diseases such as cholera. Small beer and faux wine, in particular, were used for this purpose. Although alcohol kills bacteria, its low concentration in these beverages would have had only a limited effect. More important was that the boiling of water (required for the brewing of beer) {{and the growth of}} yeast (required for fermentation of beer and wine) would kill dangerous microorganisms. The alcohol content of these beverages allowed them to be stored for months or years in simple wood or clay containers without spoiling. For this reason, they were commonly kept aboard sailing vessels as an important (or even the sole) source of hydration for the crew, especially during the long voyages of the early modern period.|$|E

Kattaha was originally given the name Hannikkun. The usage of the term Kattaha over Hannikkun, according to Ronald Gorny (head of the Alisar regional project in Turkey), was a device to downgrade the Pre-Hittite identity of this female deity, and to bring her {{more in touch with}} the Hittite tradition. Their reconfiguration of Gods throughout their early history such as with Kattaha <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> legitimizing their authority and to avoid conflicting ideologies in newly included regions and settlements. By transforming local deities to fit their own customs, the Hittites hoped that the traditional beliefs of these communities would understand and accept the changes to become better suited for the Hittite political and economic goals.|$|E

25|$|The magistrates {{were people}} who {{occupied}} a public post and formed {{the administration of the}} Athenian state. They were submitted to rigorous public control. The magistrates were chosen by lot, using fava beans. Black and white beans were put in a box and depending on which color the person drew out they obtained the post or not. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> eliminating the personal influence of rich people and possible intrigues and use of favors. There were only two categories of posts not chosen by lot, but by election in the Popular Assembly. These were strategos, or general, and magistrate of finance. It was generally supposed that significant qualities were needed to exercise each of those two offices. A magistrate's post did not last more than a year, including that of the strategoi and in this sense the continued selection of Pericles year after year was an exception. At the end of every year, a magistrate would have to give an account of his administration and use of public finances.|$|E
