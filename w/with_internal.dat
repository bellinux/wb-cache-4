The {{results indicate that}} the lateral forces may be optional for the hollow columns, but they are required to accurately predict flow characteristics in the bubble columns <b>with</b> <b>internals.</b> Furthermore, it has been found that the bubbly flow behavior in the bubble columns <b>with</b> <b>internals</b> is more sensitive to the lateral forces in comparison <b>with</b> those without <b>internals,</b> and the complex geometry significantly alters the response of bubbly flow to the interfacial forces. In addition, despite the insignificant effect on gas holdup, the presence of internals gives rise to an enhancement of large-scale liquid circulation due to the remarkable decrease of turbulent viscosity.

40|$|The fixed-bed reactor <b>with</b> <b>internals</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} to enhance the pyrolysis performance for coal. In this study, the pyrolysis behavior of different coal moisture contents and the reaction mechanism were investigated in an indirectly heated fixed-bed reactor <b>with</b> <b>internals.</b> The results showed that, at a furnace temperature of 900 degrees C, the increased coal moisture content went from 0. 41 to 11. 68 wt % and significantly modified the temperature fields, thereby prolonging the pyrolysis time to reach 500 degrees C and then enhancing the condensation and trapping of the coal at the bed center. Therefore, the tar yield and light tar content were raised from 9. 21 and 63. 7 wt % to 10. 74 and 64. 5 wt %, respectively. However, when the coal moisture content exceeded 16. 77 wt %, the tar yield and light tar content decreased to 8. 55 and 62. 0 wt %, respectively. In addition, the higher heating value (HHV) of char <b>with</b> <b>internals</b> was dramatically higher than that without internals, and the char HHV in the reactor <b>with</b> <b>internals</b> rose primarily and then decreased {{with the increase in}} the coal moisture; meanwhile, its fixed carbon content of char showed an increase, followed by a decline.

40|$|Our {{previous}} studies have shown evident technical superiorities of oil shale pyrolysis in a newly devised fixed bed reactor <b>with</b> particularly designed <b>internals</b> (Fuel Processing Technology, 138, 2015 : 147 - 155). This study is furthered to optimize the operating conditions {{by focusing on the}} reaction pressure to enhance the yield and quality of shale oil in the fixed bed reactor <b>with</b> <b>internals.</b> Reducing the pyrolysis pressure increased the shale oil yield in comparison with the pyrolysis under atmospheric pressure. This influence due to reducing reaction pressure appeared to be higher in the reactor <b>with</b> <b>internals</b> than in the reactor without any internals. Moreover, there were higher yield of aliphatic components and fewer aromatic species in the reactor <b>with</b> <b>internals,</b> essentially indicating the suppressed secondary reactions to the produced primary shale oil in the new reactor. In this reactor the shale oil yield reached 97. 57 % of the Fisher Assay yield (8. 24 wt. % dry basis) at a furnace heating temperature of 1000 degrees C under reduced pressure conditions. Consequently, there is actually some synergistic effect between internals and reducing pressure so that adopting internals and using vacuum condition can grant the indirectly heated fixed bed reactor great potential to achieve high yield and high quality of shale oil in oil shale pyrolysis.
