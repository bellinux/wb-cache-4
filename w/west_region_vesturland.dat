30|$|As an {{important}} resource in the USA, shale gas promotes the “energy independence” {{of the country}} (Feng et al. 2016). As the most successful country in shale gas development, the USA has mature technology for this venture. Therefore, most countries or districts select shale gas reservoirs in North America as the standard areas for evaluating shale gas resources using the analogy method. The organic carbon content, kerogen type, vitrinite reflectance, single-layer shale thickness, brittleness index, porosity, and burial depth of the typical shale gas reservoirs in the USA and the northwest and <b>west</b> <b>regions</b> of the Oriente Basin are thus obtained and compared (Ma et al. 2012). On {{the basis of these}} parameters, areas in the USA that are similar to the northwest and <b>west</b> <b>regions</b> of the Oriente Basin are selected. The area resource abundance of typical shale gas reservoirs in the USA is used to determine that of the lower Napo Formation of the northwest and <b>west</b> <b>regions</b> of the Oriente Basin.|$|R
