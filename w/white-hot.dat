5|$|In 1880, one John Holland of Cincinnati {{discovered}} {{the ability to}} melt and make castings of iridium by fusing the <b>white-hot</b> ore with phosphorus, and patented the process in the United States. He invoked the help of Dudley in {{getting rid of the}} phosphorus, who did so by repeated applications of lime at great heat. This was the first reported method of refining iridium. Dudley then found new applications for iridium, and formed the American Iridium Company with Holland. Dudley filed a patent on his method for iridium electroplating in 1887.|$|E

25|$|In 1873, Frederick Guthrie {{discovered}} the basic principle of operation of thermionic diodes. He {{discovered that a}} positively charged electroscope could be discharged by bringing a grounded piece of <b>white-hot</b> metal close to it (but not actually touching it). The same {{did not apply to}} a negatively charged electroscope, indicating that the current flow was only possible in one direction.|$|E
25|$|In 1875 Swan {{returned}} {{to consider the}} problem of the light bulb {{with the aid of a}} better vacuum and a carbonized thread as a filament. The most significant feature of Swan's improved lamp was that there was little residual oxygen in the vacuum tube to ignite the filament, thus allowing the filament to glow almost <b>white-hot</b> without catching fire. However, his filament had low resistance, thus needing heavy copper wires to supply it.|$|E
25|$|In the Big Bang {{model for}} the {{formation}} of the universe, Inflationary Cosmology predicts that after about 10−37 seconds the nascent universe underwent exponential growth that smoothed out nearly all irregularities. The remaining irregularities were caused by quantum fluctuations in the inflaton field that caused the inflation event. Before the formation of stars and planets (after 10−6 seconds), the early universe was smaller, much hotter, and filled with a uniform glow from its <b>white-hot</b> fog of interacting plasma of photons, electrons, and baryons.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of CMB is landmark {{evidence of the}} Big Bang origin of the universe. When the universe was young, before the formation of stars and planets, it was denser, much hotter, and filled with a uniform glow from a <b>white-hot</b> fog of hydrogen plasma. As the universe expanded, both the plasma and the radiation filling it grew cooler. When the universe cooled enough, protons and electrons combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms. Unlike the uncombined protons and electrons, these newly conceived atoms could not absorb the thermal radiation, and so the universe became transparent instead of being an opaque fog. Cosmologists refer to the time period when neutral atoms first formed as the recombination epoch, and the event shortly afterwards when photons started to travel freely through space rather than constantly being scattered by electrons and protons in plasma {{is referred to as}} photon decoupling. The photons that existed at the time of photon decoupling have been propagating ever since, though growing fainter and less energetic, since the expansion of space causes their wavelength to increase over time (and wavelength is inversely proportional to energy according to Planck's relation). This {{is the source of the}} alternative term relic radiation. The surface of last scattering refers to the set of points in space at the right distance from us so that we are now receiving photons originally emitted from those points at the time of photon decoupling.|$|E
500|$|At 9:04:35am, the out-of-control fire {{on board}} Mont-Blanc finally set off her highly {{explosive}} cargo. The ship was completely blown apart {{and a powerful}} blast wave radiated away from the explosion at more than [...] per second. Temperatures of [...] and pressures of thousands of atmospheres accompanied the moment of detonation at {{the centre of the}} explosion. <b>White-hot</b> shards of iron fell down upon Halifax and Dartmouth. Mont-Blancs forward 90mm gun, its barrel melted away, landed approximately [...] north of the explosion site near Albro Lake in Dartmouth, while the shank of her anchor, weighing half a ton, landed [...] south at Armdale.|$|E
500|$|The thirteenth {{season premiere}} {{received}} generally positive reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Ken Tucker gave the episode a positive review, showing approval of Kenny's misadventure, saying [...] "thus did South Park ultimately {{come down on}} the side of religion and sexual freedom, with lots of big laughs in the bargain.... Trey and Matt are off to a great 13th-season start." [...] James Poniewozik of Time said [...] "The Ring" [...] was better than any of the twelfth season episodes. Poniewozik said the episode, [...] "demonstrated that the cartoon is best when it focuses on the four kids and when it is driven by a <b>white-hot</b> moral fury". Travis Fickett of IGN also particularly applauded the Disney satire, which he said, [...] "elevates this beyond shock humor and into sharp satire." [...] IGN gave the episode an 8.4 score out of 10.|$|E
500|$|In 1786, Charles III of Spain {{provided}} a library and laboratory to Pierre-François Chabaneau {{to aid in}} his research of platinum. Chabaneau succeeded in removing various impurities from the ore, including gold, mercury, lead, copper, and iron. This led him {{to believe he was}} working with a single metal, but in truth the ore still contained the yet-undiscovered platinum-group metals. This led to inconsistent results in his experiments. At times, the platinum seemed malleable, but when it was alloyed with iridium, it would be much more brittle. Sometimes the metal was entirely incombustible, but when alloyed with osmium, it would volatilize. After several months, Chabaneau succeeded in producing 23kilograms of pure, malleable platinum by hammering and compressing the sponge form while <b>white-hot.</b> Chabeneau realized the infusibility of platinum would lend value to objects made of it, and so started a business with Joaquín Cabezas producing platinum ingots and utensils. This started {{what is known as the}} [...] "platinum age" [...] in Spain.|$|E
500|$|Alternatively, his {{covers of}} [...] "I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus" [...] and [...] "Hard Candy Christmas" [...] were noted {{for their use}} of camp. However, RuPaul {{identified}} [...] "Hard Candy Christmas" [...] {{as one of the}} [...] "serious ones" [...] on the album, and said it was only referenced as camp due to [...] "the fact that [...] doing it". When recording the song, Visage was unfamiliar with its source The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas, and sang it according to RuPaul's direction. Carol Hall, who had written the song, had described RuPaul's cover as her favorite version of single, and ranked it above Dolly Parton's interpretation. The album also includes a cover of [...] "You're a Mean One, Mr. Grinch" [...] incorporating elements from funk, and [...] "Christmas Train (Medley)", which serves as [...] "a sassy summary of the season’s favorites atop a <b>white-hot</b> club mix". The final track is a remix of the [...] "Celebrate", which had previously appeared on Foxy Lady (1996). It peaked at number 31 on Billboard Dance Club Songs chart on October 11, 1997 and remained on the chart for a total of seven weeks.|$|E
500|$|Cameron {{himself said}} {{he decided to}} open the film in December {{so that it would}} have less {{competition}} from then to January. Titanic capitalized on the same January predictability, and earned most of its gross in 1998. Additionally, Avatar established itself as a [...] "must-see" [...] event. Gray said, [...] "At this point, {{people who are going to}} see Avatar are going to see Avatar and would even if the slate was strong." [...] Marketing the film as a [...] "novelty factor" [...] also helped. Fox positioned the film as a cinematic event that should be seen in the theatres. [...] "It's really hard to sell the idea that you can have the same experience at home," [...] stated David Mumpower, an analyst at BoxOfficeProphets.com. The [...] "Oscar buzz" [...] surrounding the film and international viewings helped. [...] "Two-thirds of Titanics haul was earned overseas, and Avatar [...] similarly...Avatar opened in 106 markets globally and was No. 1 in all of them", and the markets [...] "such as Russia, where Titanic saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are <b>white-hot</b> today" [...] with [...] "more screens and moviegoers" [...] than before.|$|E
500|$|From the American perspective, {{the most}} serious {{situation}} was the attack concentrated on a small team situated at the small observation post [...] "TOPSIDE" [...] nestled among rocks under a tree 50m to 70m outside the main base. The first round hit accurately, wounding or stunning every soldier. Pfc. Tyler Stafford was blown out of his machine-gun position next to Spc. Matthew Phillips who threw a grenade before he was mortally wounded. Cpl. Jason Bogar fired hundreds of rounds from his automatic weapon until the barrel became <b>white-hot</b> and jammed and then tended to Stafford's wounds. A rocket grenade wounded Sgt. Ryan M. Pitts, who was also tended by Bogar with a tourniquet around Pitts' leg before switching to another gun. Bogar then jumped from the outpost bunker to {{get close enough to}} kill insurgents who were firing down upon the men from the village hotel. [...] Once outside the bunker, he was shot through the chest and killed. [...] The surviving soldiers then ran from the outpost to the main post, leaving Pitts behind. [...] Alone, Pitts was able to hold-off the Taliban from overrunning his position until his comrades returned two hours later and he was evacuated to receive medical care.|$|E
500|$|Titanic {{held the}} record for box office gross for twelve years. Cameron's {{follow-up}} film, Avatar, was considered the first film with a genuine chance at surpassing its worldwide gross, and did so in 2010. Various explanations for why the film was able to successfully challenge Titanic were given. For one, [...] "Two-thirds of Titanic haul was earned overseas, and Avatar [...] similarly... Avatar opened in 106 markets globally and was no. 1 in all of them" [...] and the markets [...] "such as Russia, where Titanic saw modest receipts in 1997 and 1998, are <b>white-hot</b> today" [...] with [...] "more screens and moviegoers" [...] than ever before. Brandon Gray, president of Box Office Mojo, said that while Avatar may beat Titanic revenue record, the film is unlikely to surpass Titanic in attendance. [...] "Ticket prices were about $3 cheaper in the late 1990s." [...] In December 2009, Cameron had stated, [...] "I don't think it's realistic to try to topple Titanic off its perch. Some pretty good movies have {{come out in the}} last few years. Titanic just struck some kind of chord." [...] In a January 2010 interview, he gave a different take on the matter once Avatar performance was easier to predict. [...] "It's gonna happen. It's just a matter of time," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|A {{review in}} the New York Times noted that the basic premise is a good idea, but [...] "studded {{as it is with}} undigested chunks of {{scientific}} jargon, sociology-speak and polemical rhetoric Batman: The Ultimate Evil misses out almost completely on the pure pulp thrills that {{lie at the heart of}} its title character's appeal." [...] In the St. Petersburg Times, Adam Begley also noted the use of what he called [...] "techno-babble". In The Washington Post, Jack Womack wrote that Vachss describes the Batmobile [...] "lovingly yet gnomically, as if a Motor Trend review had been translated into Slovakian by someone more familiar with Czech" [...] and concluded that the novel was [...] "as satisfying — aesthetically, ethically, morally — as a pulse-pounding yarn in which pulp-fiction hero Doc Savage ransacks the shantytowns of South America in a terribly successful search for Doc Mengele." [...] In Kirkus Reviews, the story was compared to a generic [...] "Destroy All Exploiters" [...] video game where Batman [...] "disposes of each lower-level pimp, then moves up to the next level". Sybil Steinberg in Publishers Weekly noted that [...] "while no classic, this is likely the [...] most stylish adaptation yet of a comic-book figure, its cold stiletto prose and <b>white-hot</b> passions lifting it leagues above recent Spider-man and Incredible Hulk offerings. It's also Vachss' best work since Shella". [...] Both the Library Journal and Booklist predicted heavy demand for it at public libraries.|$|E
500|$|Bieber {{performed}} the song on his promotional [...] "My World" [...] tour throughout the United States. Internationally, {{he appeared on}} the European program The Dome and performed [...] "One Time". As far as televised performances go, he performed [...] "One Time" [...] on MTV's VMA Tour to precede the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, September 26, 2009, on YTV's The Next Star, and on the Today Show. He also {{performed the}} song on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on November 3, 2009; Good Morning America on November 15, 2009; Lopez Tonight on November 17, 2009, and The Wendy Williams Show on November 27, 2009. The song was Bieber's ending number while on his two-show stint as an opening act for Taylor Swift's Fearless Tour. On November 23, 2009, while performing in London on the tour, Bieber fractured his foot {{at the beginning of}} performing this song during Swift's Wembley Arena concert, but continued to perform the rest of the song. He was able to perform on stage the next night in Manchester, with a cast and limited dancing. After the televised appearances, the Urban Behavior Tour, and Fearless Tour, Bieber traveled in Europe to promote the album before returning to the US to resume his promotional tour. Bieber performed the song in Las Vegas for Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest on December 31, 2009. While promoting the album in the United Kingdom, Bieber performed an acoustic rendition of [...] "One Time" [...] on BBC's Blue Peter on January 12, 2010. He performed it on CBS' The Early Show as a part of their Super Bowl XLIV programming. Bieber performed the song at a concert at the Hollywood Palladium, and August Brown of the Los Angeles Times commented, [...] "'One Time', helmed by <b>white-hot</b> producer Christopher 'Tricky' Stewart, is an endearing, swaggering little thing in which Bieber convincingly jumps from Usher’s rapid-fire runs to pristine pop harmonies." ...|$|E

2500|$|Reviewing the Apple CD in June 1997, Ken Hunt enthused in Gramophone magazine:This is the living, fire-breathing {{embodiment}} {{of one of}} the greatest partnerships ever forged in Hindustani (Northern Indian) classical music. Their sarod–sitar brotherhood had begun under their guru during the 1940s. By the 1950s their combination of the robust, steel-clad sarod and the delicate sitar was highly acclaimed and in 1972 theirs was undoubtably the hottest ticket in Hindustani heaven … Two musicians pouring their hearts out for their guru: that is the most succinct description of this sometimes smouldering, sometimes fiery, masterpiece.

2500|$|On my {{personal}} color scale, which runs from a voluptuous red (Tebaldi) or blood-orange (Leontyne Price) or purple (Caballé) or red-purple (Troyanos) to <b>white-hot</b> (Rysanek) or runny yellow-green (Sills), Sutherland {{is among the}} [...] "blue" [...] sopranos – which {{has nothing to do}} with [...] "blues" [...] in the pop sense of the term. (Ella Fitzgerald had a blue voice, but Billie Holiday had a blues voice, which is very different.) Diana Damrau is blue. Mirella Freni is blue-ish. Karita Mattila is ice blue. Régine Crespin was deep blue shading to violet. Sutherland was true blue (like the Garter ribbon). There is a coolness here that can take on the passion in the music but does not inject passion where the music lacks it, could possibly use it.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{positive}} review, Rolling Stone magazine's Rob Sheffield called the album a [...] "more painful, honest and vital record" [...] that is on-par with Eminem's 2002 album The Eminem Show. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic described the album as [...] "musically <b>white-hot,</b> dense, and dramatic" [...] {{and said that}} [...] "his flow is so good, his wordplay so sharp, it seems churlish to wish that he addressed something other than his long-standing obsessions and demons". The Daily Telegraph commended its honest depiction of Eminem's drug addiction and overuse. Although he found its concept [...] "spotty", Vibes Benjamin Meadows-Ingram praised Eminem's lyricism, writing that [...] "Em works wonders with words, expanding {{the boundaries of the}} art of rap itself [...] the composition is experimental and abstract, a master toying with form". At the 52nd Grammy Awards, the album won a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album.|$|E
2500|$|An {{excess of}} {{acetylene}} creates a carbonizing flame. This flame {{is characterized by}} three flame zones; the hot inner cone, a <b>white-hot</b> [...] "acetylene feather", and the blue-colored outer cone. This {{is the type of}} flame observed when oxygen is first added to the burning acetylene. The feather is adjusted and made ever smaller by adding increasing amounts of oxygen to the flame. A welding feather is measured as 2X or 3X, with X being the length of the inner flame cone. The unburned carbon insulates the flame and drops the temperature to approximately [...] The reducing flame is typically used for hard facing operations or backhand pipe welding techniques. The feather is caused by incomplete combustion of the acetylene to cause an excess of carbon in the flame. Some of this carbon is dissolved by the molten metal to carbonize it. The carbonizing flame will tend to remove the oxygen from iron oxides which may be present, a fact which has caused the flame to be known as a [...] "reducing flame".|$|E

[...] In an article for The Texas Monthly in 1994, Nick Tosches eloquently described the singer's vocal style: [...] "While he and his idol, Hank Williams, have both affected generations with a plaintive veracity of voice that has set them apart, Jones has an additional gift—a voice of exceptional range, natural elegance, and lucent tone. Gliding toward high tenor, plunging toward deep bass, the magisterial portamento of his onward-coursing baritone emits <b>white-hot</b> sparks and torrents of blue, investing his poison love songs with a tragic gravity and inflaming his celebrations of the honky-tonk ethos with the hellfire of abandon."

He {{would go on to}} add that [...] "we get rhymes… more rhymes than some rappers manage in a whole career". Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times said, [...] "Eminem sounds more alive – angrier yet fully present – than he has in years… Eminem burns with purpose on [...] "MMLP2".

2500|$|One of Furtwängler's protégés was {{the pianist}} prodigy Karlrobert Kreiten {{who was killed}} by the Nazis in 1943 because he had criticized Hitler. He was an {{important}} influence on the pianist/conductor Daniel Barenboim, of whom Furtwängler's widow, Elisabeth Furtwängler, said, [...] "Er furtwänglert" [...] ("He furtwänglers"). Barenboim has conducted a recording of Furtwängler's 2nd Symphony, with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. Other conductors known to speak admiringly of Furtwängler include Valery Gergiev, Claudio Abbado, Carlos Kleiber, Carlo Maria Giulini, Simon Rattle, Sergiu Celibidache, Otto Klemperer, Karl Böhm, Bruno Walter, Dimitri Mitropoulos, Christoph Eschenbach, Alexander Frey, Eugen Jochum, Zubin Mehta, Ernest Ansermet, Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Bernard Haitink, Gustavo Dudamel, Jascha Horenstein (who had worked {{as an assistant to}} Furtwängler in Berlin during the 1920s), Kurt Masur and Christian Thielemann.
