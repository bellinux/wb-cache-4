In fruit residue and kernels parts from eight different cultivars, determination of cyaniding- 3 -O-glucoiside (C 3 G) levels using HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography), various functional assays including antioxidant, and antifungal assays in vitro, cytotoxic assays and also antifatigue assays in vivo using reducing testes, rectangular cantilever method, small microtiter-plate method and mice loaded swimming test, respectively. The results of the HPLC method showed the extracts of residue were rich in cyaniding- 3 -O-glucoside, especially in Myricarubra Sieb. Et Zucc. cv. Biqi (212. 8 mg·g- 1 from Ninghai and 185. 7 mg·g- 1 from Yuyao). The results of the activity experiments showed the TE values of the extract from Biqi were between 334 and 506 mmol·g- 1 detected by different methods. The duration of loaded swimming to exhaust prolonged from 614 ± 158 s to 1012 ± 205 s.

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that unit-based pricing systems {{have a significant}} effect on the quantity of collected <b>waste.</b> <b>Part</b> of this effect may, however, result from a selection bias or environmental activism effect. Based on a pooled cross-section for the Netherlands for 1998 - 2005 we show that despite the correction for environmental activism the effect of the weight and bag unit-based pricing system on the quantity of waste is sizeable. Moreover, this environmental activism effect is decreasing over time, so that the most environmental friendly municipalities implement unit-based pricing systems at first. In addition, we show that the volume effects of the different unit-based pricing systems are rather stable over time. Although we find some evidence for a learning effect, nearly no evidence is found for an awareness erosion effect. This means at least that the effect of unit-based pricing does not decrease over time, which is reassuring from an environmental point of view. Pricing waste helps. © 2008 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In Belgium, the Boom Clay {{is being}} {{considered}} as a potential host formation for the disposal of nuclear <b>waste.</b> <b>Part</b> of the safety assessment and feasibility studies of a potential nuclear waste disposal consists of hydrogeological modeling. In order to model the groundwater flow and possible radionuclide transport in the clay, the spatial distribution of the hydraulic conductivity of the clay has to be assessed. In this study, geostatistical methods are used to characterize the hydraulic conductivity field. More specific, direct sequential simulation of the hydraulic conductivity is carried out, using measurements of hydraulic conductivity and 4 types of soft data or secondary variables: resistivity logs, gamma ray logs, grain size measurements and descriptions of the lithology. The primary and secondary information is analyzed with geostatistical tools and combined to generate 100 fields of the hydraulic conductivity of the Boom Clay. Next, each field is input to a groundwater flow model to predict the advective travel time of constituents released from the disposed waste in the Boom Clay to the aquifers surrounding the Boom Clay. Statistical analysis of the ensemble of model predictions results in a predictive distribution for the advective travel time. This distribution reflects {{the uncertainty of the}} advective travel time that results from the uncertainty of the spatial distribution of the hydraulic conductivity of the Boom Cla...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} role of {{biological}} geotextiles on non-agricultural erosion environments, based on studies in the mine tailings Gauteng Province (South Africa) and urban area of São Luis City (Brazil). Gauteng Province (South Africa) has suffered immense problems related to sustainable rehabilitation of mine dumps. This is a huge challenge, as wastes are highly susceptible to both water and wind erosion. Establishing a grass cover to reduce erosion is the dominant reclamation method. Covering the slopes with biological geotextiles might constitute another option for mining companies to reduce erosion and aid natural re-vegetation. The objective of the <b>waste</b> <b>part</b> {{of this study was}} to determine the beneficial effect of palm mat cover on erosion control, using rainfall simulation. Results clearly illustrated that application of palm-mats more than halved the sediment load in runoff, thereby having the potential to effectively stabilize tailing dam slopes. Covering tailings with palm-mats did not reduce runoff or improve water infiltration, however. In São Luis City, biological geotextile mats were constructed from palm leaves which are an effective, sustainable and economically-viable soil conservation technique. At Sacavém Community biological geotextile mats were used in association with barriers of wooden stakes and the construction of terraces along contour lines. The aim is to minimize soil erosion, by intercepting rainfall, retarding runoff velocity and sediment loss...|$|E
