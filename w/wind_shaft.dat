50|$|De Gekroonde Poelenburg is a Dutch paltrok mill - {{a wooden}} mill {{supported}} {{on a short}} central post and a ring of wooden rollers on a low brick base and designed specifically for sawing wood. The mill body is boarded, however the sawing floor is open on three sides with only the windward facing side and the side roofs giving protection against the weather. The entire mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. On the front is a stage, 3.0 m above ground for setting the sails. The sails are common sails with a span of 20.3 m. They are carried on a cast iron windshaft cast by foundry De Prins van Oranje as number 0430 in 1866. The brake wheel with 66 cogs on the <b>wind</b> <b>shaft</b> drives the crank wheel with 26 radial cogs on the horizontal crank shaft. There is no upright shaft. The crank shaft has three crank pins. Connecting rods from the crank pins drive the three frame saws. Reciprocating lever bars also drive the pawl and ratchet mechanisms which in turn drive the winches and the feeding mechanism of the log carriages through rack and pinion mechanisms. The winches {{can be used with}} the log hoist to lift logs from the water onto the sawing platform and to pull the log carriages back to their starting position.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This paper {{presents}} the synoptic and meso-scale {{aspects of the}} intense convective activity of 2 September 1974 in the Eastern Atlantic. Two main features were evident in the GATE B-scale array: a broad convective band associated with the 700 ~mb trough, and long and narrow lines of convection oriented SE-NW. One of these lines, which moved across the B-scale array and was penetrated by several aircraft, is described in detail. The structure of the cloud and precipitation fields, obtainedfrom the analysis of satellite and radar data, indicates that intenseprecipita-tion occurred mainly {{at the leading edge}} of the line where new cells were continuously generating. Cross-sections through the line (from boom, aircraft and tethered balloon data) show a gust front at the surface, a downdraft region associated with the rain area, and a <b>wind</b> <b>shaft</b> in the lowest 300 m.

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} the results of experimental investigation of a low-power wind energy conversion system (WECS), based on a permanent-magnet synchronous generator (PMSG) connected directly to the turbine. A development system was built in order to carry out the experiments. Its detailed description is also provided. The development system can work as an autonomous system for remote sites or as a grid-connected system, illustrating the concept of distributed production of electrical energy. It includes a wind turbine simulator, which is speed or torque controlled and offers a "wind shaft", where the static and dynamic characteristics of a turbine are obtained. The <b>wind</b> <b>shaft</b> generator drives a permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG). The other components of the hybrid system are: a battery, a classical source and, possibly, a PV source. The hardware/software application is based on the dSPACE system. The experimental results show that the performance of a multi-polar-PMSG-based small wind power system is strongly determined by the generatorâ€™s behaviour. Two optimal regimes characteristics (ORC) are defined in this paper: the first one re{{presents the}} mechanical power versus the rotational speed (ORC) and the second one is the electrical power delivered to a load versus the rotational speed (ORC). An optimal control loop aiming to maximize the delivered electrical power is designed, namely its reference is computed based on the ORC. In this way, the global efficiency of the energy conversion is maximized. The effectiveness of the proposed optimal control loop is illustrated by experimental results. m...|$|E

A massive horizontal steam winding engine, which still exists, was installed by the Worsley Mesnes company of Manchester in the Winding Engine House {{to become one of the}} principal coal <b>winding</b> <b>shafts.</b> A new power house was also constructed as part of the complex.

The colliery suffered a significant accident on 21 December 1852 when a firedamp explosion killed 10 miners and injured 12. The inquiry found that the explosion had been caused by reckless behaviour of the colliers; a ventilation door had been propped open which resulted in firedamp accumulating and some colliers using unguarded safety lamps. Earl Fitzwilliam's mine superintendent, Benjamin Biram was criticised by the inquiry for absence of printed rules in the colliery, inadequate maintenance of lamps and poor supervision of the workforce but the judge praised the ventilation arrangements in the pit which prevented extensive loss of life.|$|R

The miners' {{equipment}} included picks, hammers and wedges to split the rock, wiskets or baskets to contain it, corves or sledges to drag it to the shaft bottom, and windlasses or stows, to lift it to the surface. In later years underground transport was improved by replacing corves by wagons, often running on wooden or metal rails. A good example of an 18th-century wooden railway {{can be found in the}} Merry Tom mine, near Via Gellia. The miners avoided the need to excavate hard rock whenever they could and where it was unavoidable sometimes resorted to fire-setting. A fire was built against the rock face after mining had finished for the day and allowed to burn through the night. Fragmentation of the heated rock was increased by throwing water on to it. The rule about fire-setting only after the end of the day's work was important because in the confined mines the smoke was deadly. Fire-setting was a skilled technique and was used sparingly for that reason as well as because of the disruption caused by the smoke and the danger from splintering rock.|$|R
