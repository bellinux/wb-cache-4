Prior to European settlement, the Lower Mississippi Valley was covered with over 24 million acres (97,000 km2) of bottomland hardwood forest that supported a rich diversity of fish and wildlife species. Historically, the dominant forest type was oak-gum-cypress. [...] covered the broader flats on slightly higher ground, forming extensive nearly pure stands beneath huge bottomland hardwood trees. Settlers began clearing the forest in the early 19th century. Today more than 75% of the forest coverage has been lost to land clearing operations for agriculture, transportation, industrialization, and urbanization.

50|$|One of the authors, who was kayaking in the Cache River National Wildlife Refuge, Monroe County, Arkansas, on 11 February 2004, {{reported}} on a website the sighting of an unusually large red-crested woodpecker. This report led to more intensive searches {{in the area and}} in the White River National Wildlife Refuge, undertaken in secrecy for fear of a stampede of bird-watchers, by experienced observers over the next 14 months. About 15 sightings occurred during the period (seven of which were considered compelling enough to mention in the scientific article), possibly all of the same bird. One of these more reliable sightings was on 27 February 2004. Bobby Harrison of Huntsville, Alabama, and Tim Gallagher of Ithaca, New York, both reported seeing an ivory-billed woodpecker at the same time. The secrecy of the search permitted The Nature Conservancy and Cornell University to quietly buy up ivory-billed woodpecker habitat to add to the 120,000 acre of the Big Woods protected by the conservancy.A large woodpecker was videotaped on 25 April 2004; its size, wing pattern at rest and in flight, and white plumage on its back between the wings were cited as evidence that the woodpecker sighted was an ivory-billed woodpecker.

40|$|Examination of Seasat SAR {{images of}} eastern Maryland and Virginia reveals botanical distinctions between vegetated lowland areas and {{adjacent}} upland areas. Radar {{returns from the}} lowland areas can be either brighter or darker than returns from the upland forests.

This agrees with the 30 -digital number (DN) increase observed in the digital Seasat data. The brightest areas in the Chickahominy, Virginia, drainage, containing P. virginica about 0. 4 m high, contrast with the brightest areas in the Blackwater, Maryland, marshes, which contain mature loblolly pine in standing water.

Few studies have evaluated plant community relationships in blackwater river systems of the South Atlantic Coastal Plain of North America. In this study. we characterized the soils. hydroperiod, and vegetation communities and evaluated relationships between the physical and chemical environment and plant community xtructure on the floodplain of the Coosawhatchie River, a blackwater river in South Carolina, USA. The soils were similar to previous descriptions of blackwater floodplain soils but had greater soil N and P availability, substantially greater clay content, and lower soil silt content than was previously reported for other blackwater river floodplains.

40|$|Summary Effects of {{short-term}} (32 days) flooding on pho-tosynthesis, stomatal conductance, relative growth rate and tissue starch concentrations of flood-intolerant Quercus alba L. (white oak), bottomland Quercus nigra L. (water oak), bottomland Fraxinus pennsylvanica Marshall. (green ash) and flood-tolerant Nyssa aquatica L. (<b>water</b> <b>tupelo)</b> seedlings were studied under controlled conditions. Net photosynthetic rates of flooded N. aquatica seedlings were reduced by 25 % throughout the 32 -day flooding period. Net photosynthetic rates of flooded Q. alba seedlings fell rapidly to 25 % {{of those of}} the control seedlings by Day 4 of the flooding treatment and to 5 % by Day 16. In F. pennsylvanica and Q. nigra, net photosynthetic rates were reduced to 50 % of control values by Day 8 but remained at approximately 30 and 23 %, respectively, of control values by Day 32. Leaves of flooded Q. alba seed-lings accumulated approximately twice as much starch as leaves of non-flooded control plants, whereas root starch con-centrations decreased to 67 % of those of control plants {{by the end of}} the 32 -day flooding treatment. In contrast, flooding caused only a small increase in leaf starch concentrations of N. aquatica plants, but it increased root starch concentrations to 119 % of those of the control plants {{by the end of the}} experiment. The co-occurring bottomland species, Fraxinus pennsylvanica and Q. nigra, differed from each other in their patterns of stomatal conductance and root starch concentra-tions. We conclude that the maintenance of low leaf starch concentrations, and high pre-flood root tissue starch concen-trations are important characteristics allowing flood-tolerant species to survive in flooded soils...|$|E
40|$|Trees {{native to}} {{seasonally}} flooded wetlands can be valuable in managed landscapes where wide fluctuations in soil moisture occur regularly. Nyssa aquatica L. (<b>water</b> <b>tupelo)</b> is a large, deciduous tree native to continuously and periodically flooded wetlands {{of the southeastern}} United States. I investigated the potential for using this tree in horticulture based on its tolerance to extreme fluctuations in soil moisture, water deficit, and its capability to be propagated asexually via stem cuttings. I also examined the genetic structure of the species across its native range by using inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSRs). Seedlings of N. aquatica were more tolerant to water deficit than seedlings of Nyssa ogeche Bartram ex. Marsh. (Ogeechee tupelo), another native North American species indigenous to wetland soils. Up to 40 % mortality was observed for N. ogeche when subjected to repeated cycles of soil drying, whereas a maximum of 20 % mortality was observed for N. aquaticasubjected to the same treatment. Seedlings of N. aquatica were tolerant to wide fluctuations in soil moisture but were sensitive to long-term water deficit when growth potential was high during spring and early summer. Plants exposed to moderate soil moisture before water deficit exhibited reduced photosynthetic rates and predawn water potentials, whereas plants subjected to flooding before water deficit had photosynthetic rates and predawn water potentials {{similar to those of}} well-watered controls and had greater aesthetic appeal than those pretreated with moderate soil moisture. Slower growth rates and reduced leaf area resulted when plants were treated with water deficit or flooding, which led to reduced transpirational demand and probably contributed to increased tolerance to future water deficit compared with plants pretreated with moderate soil moisture. Softwood cuttings of juvenile stems rooted at high frequency (up to 93 % success). Rooting was best among cuttings from terminal positions on stock plants treated with a solution containing 1 -naphthalenacetic acid (NAA). Genetic analyses of 24 populations of N. aquatica revealed moderate differentiation among populations and minimal regional structure...|$|E
