2500|$|During the show, {{there was}} a [...] "fierce {{competition}} between the Anglo-French Concorde and the Russian Tu-144". [...] The Soviet pilot, Mikhail Kozlov, had bragged that he would outperform the Concorde. [...] "Just <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> us fly," [...] he was quoted as saying. [...] "Then you'll see something." [...] On {{the final day of}} the show, the Concorde, which was not yet in production, performed its demonstration flight first. [...] Its performance was later described as being unexciting, and it has been theorized that Kozlov was determined to show how much better his aircraft was.|$|E
2500|$|Formula One driver Bruno Senna is {{the nephew}} of Senna (being his sister Viviane's son) of whom he said in 1993: [...] "If you think I'm fast, just <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> my nephew Bruno." [...] Due {{to the death of}} his uncle, Bruno {{initially}} gave up motor racing at his family's insistence. He eventually raced in F1 between 2010 and 2012, in the latter year for the Williams team, which was a decision that, reportedly, had a significant emotional impact on the Senna family and was seen by some as a signing only resulting from Bruno's big name and the money it could bring.|$|E

6000|$|Lawrence's gesture {{hinted at}} humorous resignation. [...] "You're a restless fellow, Jake, but I hoped you'd <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> to-morrow. <b>You</b> <b>see,</b> I've been warned to keep quiet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> I <b>see</b> <b>you</b> go on board," [...] {{the guard}} {{said when they}} reached the beach. [...] "You will be called upon some time to-morrow." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "About {{as well as}} we all are," [...] said Stacy quickly, {{yet with}} a certain dry significance. [...] "Never mind now; <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> him." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jimmy rose, {{and quietly}} {{reached for his}} hat. [...] "Then," [...] he said, [...] "there {{is nothing to be}} gained by {{pointing}} out what my views are. We can only <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> things differently." ...|$|E
6000|$|Doris laughed. [...] "You're jealous! Come on." [...] A {{moment later}} they {{stood before the}} clock, looking up at it. [...] "He'll come out in a few minutes. <b>Wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> him. I know you two will get along just fine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mais voyons, Gaston," [...] the Vicomtesse protested, [...] "why harbour prejudice? <b>Wait</b> {{at least}} <b>until</b> <b>you</b> have <b>seen</b> him, that <b>you</b> may judge him for yourself." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "See me in a coat {{fit for a}} Lord!--Well, Judith, if {{you wait}} till that day, you'll <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> me beyond reason and memory. No--no--gal, my gifts are my gifts, and I'll live and die in 'em, though I never bring down another deer, or spear another salmon. What have I done that you should wish {{to see me in}} such a flaunting coat, Judith?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{not even}} sure," [...] Mr. Weatherley continued, [...] "who it was speaking, but I {{received}} some communications which I think I {{ought to take}} notice of. I want you accordingly {{to go to a}} certain restaurant in the west-end, the name and address of which I will give you, order your lunch there--you can have whatever you like--and <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> Mr. Rosario. I dare say you remember meeting Mr. Rosario last night, eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all," [...] Burke said; [...] "you {{have only}} to wait here quietly until you see an opportunity. I will go with you {{tomorrow}} to the merchants I was introduced to today, and say that I am going away for a time and shall be obliged if they will make you useful in any way until I return. In that way {{you will have a}} sort of established position here, and can <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> a chance of smuggling yourself on board some English or Dutch vessel. Mine is a very different affair. I may talk lightly of it, but I am perfectly aware that I run a tremendous risk, and that the chances are very strongly against me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{plan was}} to <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> did get your inheritance; but I see some disadvantages," [...] said Stannard in a {{thoughtful}} voice.|$|R
6000|$|A strange voice answered, {{firmly and}} kindly: [...] "Compose yourself, madam. Mr. Woodville is <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> have recovered, {{in a room}} close by." ...|$|R

6000|$|In {{spite of}} all these {{practical}} details the whole adventure seemed curiously unreal, as though it concerned some other individual, some character {{in one of my}} novels. It was a play in which I acted as manager rather than as leading man. There was nothing in all this preparation which remotely suggested any of the weddings in which I had been concerned as witness, and I suspect that Zulime was almost equally unconvinced of its reality. Poor girl! It was all as far from the wedding of her girlish dreams as her bridegroom fell short of the silver-clad knight of romance, but I promised her that she would find something grandiose and colorful in our wedding journey. [...] "Our wedding will be prosaic, but <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> the sunset light on the Crestones! Our week in the High Country shall be a poem." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> {{have had}} your supper," [...] {{interposed}} Minnie. [...] "It's all ready. I was expecting John, you know," [...] and she blushed slightly.|$|R

5000|$|Laurel Brown from Buddy TV {{stated that}} those witches arrived {{as a force}} to be {{reckoned}} with. [...] "The pilot for The Secret Circle is occasionally a bit slow as it builds up the story.

5000|$|While Today {{developer}} Sylvester [...] "Pat" [...] Weaver {{often is}} credited as the Tonight creator, Allen often {{pointed out that}} he had created it earlier as a local New York show.

5000|$|Born in Estoril, Paím {{was once}} {{regarded}} as the most promising young player in Portugal by Cristiano Ronaldo, who said upon arriving at Manchester United: [...] "If you think I'm good, just <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> Fábio Paím". He joined Sporting Clube de Portugal's youth system {{at the age of}} 10, before making his professional debut in 2007 on loan at C.D.
