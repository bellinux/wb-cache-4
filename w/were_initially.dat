40|$|Aims: Once the {{biologic}} therapies {{have been}} used, the present-day medicine trend is to homogenize {{the treatment of}} the inflammatory autoimmune rheumatic diseases, meaning rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). But, there is still the need to find out a common assessment instrument for this pathology. Methods:The study included 120 patients (40 patients with RA, 40 patients with AS, 20 patients with PsA and 20 patients with SLE). They were assessed at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the study period by using both DAS (Disease Activity Score) and HAQ (Health Assessment Questionnaire) scales. BASDAI (Bath AS Disease Activity Index) was used for AS patients and SLEDAI (SLE Disease Activity Index) for SLE patients. Results: The RA patients had significant improvements regarding both DAS and HAQ scores (DAS mean score <b>was</b> <b>initially</b> 4. 49 and finally 3. 75; HAQ mean score <b>was</b> <b>initially</b> 1. 78 and finally 2. 15; p< 0. 05). Important improvements were registered in AS patients (DAS mean score <b>was</b> <b>initially</b> 5. 25 and finally 4. 02; HAQ mean score <b>was</b> <b>initially</b> 2. 24 and finally 2. 57; BASDAI mean score <b>was</b> <b>initially</b> 4. 28 and finally 3. 21; p< 0. 05), in PsA patients (DAS mean score <b>was</b> <b>initially</b> 7. 32 and finally 5. 15; HAQ mean score <b>was</b> <b>initially</b> 2. 1 and finally 2. 51; p< 0. 05) and in SLE patients (DAS mean score <b>was</b> <b>initially</b> 4. 4 and finally 3. 45; HAQ mean score <b>was</b> <b>initially</b> 1. 9 and finally 2. 4; SLEDAI mean score <b>was</b> <b>initially</b> 24. 7 and finally 12. 5; p< 0. 05). Conclusions:Having in view that the DAS scale analyses complex aspects (clinical activity of the disease, its inflammatory lab evidence, patient’s general health status), as well as its good correlation to other specific disease scales, it can be used as a more widely assessment instrument in the autoimmune inflammatory rheumatisms...|$|R

We show that the optimal paths of sales and prices take qualitatively di¤erent shapes for di¤erent products. If the buyers <b>are</b> <b>initially</b> pessimistic, then the prices are declining over time. If the buyers <b>are</b> <b>initially</b> optimistic, then the optimal prices <b>are</b> <b>initially</b> low followed by higher prices that extract goodwill from the buyers with a high willingness to pay...|$|R

They were sent to Alison Rutherford at Newcastle University Medical School for multi-spectrum photography, which led to infra-red photographs showing the scripts for researchers for the first time. The results <b>were</b> <b>initially</b> disappointing as the scripts were undecipherable. However, Alan Bowman at Manchester University and David Thomas at Durham University analysed the previously unknown form of cursive script and were able to produce transcriptions.|$|E

5|$|Mycenaean armies <b>were</b> <b>initially</b> {{based on}} heavy infantry, {{equipped}} with spears, large shields {{and in some}} occasion armor. Later in the 13th century BC, Mycenaean warfare underwent major changes both in tactics and weaponry and armed units became more uniform and flexible, while weapons became smaller and lighter. The spear remained the main weapon among Mycenaean warriors, while the sword played a secondary role in combat. Other offensive weapons used were bows, maces, axes, slings and javelins. The precise role and contribution of chariots on the battlefield {{is a matter of}} dispute {{due to the lack of}} sufficient evidence. It appears that chariots <b>were</b> <b>initially</b> used as fighting vehicles during the 16th to 14th centuries BC, while later, in the 13th century BC, their role was limited to battlefield transport.|$|E
