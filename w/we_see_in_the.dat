But it seems that everything <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world can be accounted for by other principles, supposing God did not exist. For all natural things can be reduced to one principle which is nature; and all voluntary things can be reduced to one principle which is human reason, or will. Therefore {{there is no need to}} suppose God's existence.|$|E
25|$|The first mounted fox hunts were {{described}} by Sir Walter Scott, who also described the first working terriers in the UK. The first true breed of working terrier that bears a resemblance to what <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> field {{today is the}} Jack Russell Terrier. The Jack Russell Terrier is named after the Reverend John Russell, whose long life (1795–1883) encompasses the entire early history of mounted fox hunts in the UK and who is credited with breeding the first fox-working white-bodied terrier used in the field today.|$|E
25|$|In {{general as}} <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> graph below, {{high gas prices}} are {{typically}} associated to low storage periods. Usually when prices are high during {{the early months of}} the refill season (April–October), many users of storage adopt a wait and see attitude. They limit their gas intake in anticipation that the prices will drop before the heating season begins (November–March). However, when that decrease does not occur, they are forced to buy natural gas at high prices. This is particularly true for Local Distribution and other operators who rely on storage to meet the seasonal demand for their customers. On the other hand, other storage users, who use storage as a marketing tool (hedging or speculating) will hold off storing a lot of gas when the prices are high.|$|E

[...] He stated, [...] "...I was using the medium to change what we really know about these characters and twist around what <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> movies.

[...] Additionally, [...] "Never Marry a Mexican" [...] is characterized by the consistent use of interior monologue. Cisneros used this style in her previous novel The House on Mango Street where she mastered writing from the point of view of Esperanza; however, [...] "moving on meant experimenting with many voices". [...] She accomplished this in Woman Hollering Creek where she uses [...] "a complex variety of voices and points of view."

500|$|Mother Gothel is {{voiced by}} American actress and singer Donna Murphy, a Tony Award-winning Broadway actress who was {{informed}} about the casting call for Tangled by her agent. Having never voiced an animated character before, the actress decided to audition {{for the role of}} the film's villain based solely on the expectation that the unfamiliar experience would be [...] "fun". Almost immediately, Murphy developed a strong liking towards Gothel because of the character's complexity. Known for her award-winning Broadway performances, Murphy prepared herself for her Tangled audition similar {{to the way in which}} the actress would have prepared for a Broadway audition. Refusing to rely solely on her voice, Murphy also provided Gothel with an additional background that [...] "flush out the moments beyond what <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film." [...] Although Greno and Howard had already held Murphy in high regard as [...] "a spectacular singer", the actress was required to audition a song for the directors nonetheless, performing [...] "Children Will Listen" [...] from the musical Into the Woods. Howard revealed in an interview that Murphy was ultimately chosen out of hundreds of actresses because she possessed [...] "something extra"; the directors especially enjoyed the charisma and intelligence Murphy brought to the role.|$|E

He {{would go on to}} name Man of Steel the best Superhero movie of 2013. Jim Vejvoda of IGN gave Man of Steel a 9 out of 10 while praising the action {{sequences}} and the performances of Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon. [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave it a 3 stars out of 4, saying, [...] "Caught in the slipstream between action and angst, Man of Steel is a bumpy ride for sure. But there's no way to stay blind to its wonders." [...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said rebooting the franchise was unnecessary, but that the film was confident enough and Snyder's attention to detail careful enough that audiences could overlook another reboot. PopMatters journalist J.C. Maçek III, wrote, [...] "The path of this flawed savior isn’t quite the one that we have been led to expect and many fans will love that and many fans will decry its comic book-divergent choices. On the other hand, barring Lois Lane’s own knowledge of the dual nature of Clark and Superman (thus depriving one of fiction’s greatest reveals), the hero <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final moments of Man of Steel is nothing if not the character Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster created… with just a bit more in the 'imperfections' column." [...] Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times stated that, [...] "Man of Steel is more than just Avengers-sized escapism; it's an artistic introduction to a movie superhero we only thought we knew." [...] Time magazine's Richard Corliss said, [...] "The movie finds its true, lofty footing not when it displays Kal-El’s extraordinary powers, but when it dramatizes Clark Kent’s roiling humanity. The super part of Man of Steel is just okay, but the man part is super." [...] In a review on Roger Ebert's website, Matt Zoller Seitz awarded the film three out of four stars, calling it an [...] "astonishing movie" [...] and praising the conflict between Clark and Zod. But he criticized the film for not having more personal and intimate moments between Clark and Lois. In 2014, Empire ranked Man of Steel the 286th greatest film ever made on their list of [...] "The 301 Greatest Movies Of All Time" [...] as voted by the magazine's readers.|$|E

2500|$|In {{all these}} cases, cooling {{on the upper}} and lower {{surfaces}} of the solidified lava resulted in contraction and fracturing, starting in a blocky tetragonal pattern and transitioning to a regular hexagonal fracture pattern with fractures perpendicular to the cooling surfaces.

[...] Similar hexagonal fracture patterns are found in desiccation cracks in mud where contraction is due to loss of water instead of cooling.|$|E
