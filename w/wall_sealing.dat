5000|$|In {{the memory}} set in Iris's imprint, the Dollhouse has {{isolated}} itself. The actives {{have all been}} given their original personalities back. Topher, now mentally unstable, explains to DeWitt that a phone call could be made, and anyone who {{picked up the phone}} would be imprinted (similar to the way Echo was wiped in [...] "Gray Hour"). This would create an instant army of people programmed to kill everyone who isn't imprinted. Topher realizes that this is happening because of the technology he made possible: imprinting people with waves rather than the slower, analog method. The guilty realization of the part he has played in causing armageddon has driven him mad. DeWitt tries to comfort him but they are interrupted when a series of crashes is heard from elsewhere in the Dollhouse, which turns out to be someone trying to break through a block <b>wall</b> <b>sealing</b> off the entrance to the complex. The residents take up arms and prepare to defend themselves as the wall comes down, revealing Caroline and Paul, who havereturned to take the actives to a compound, which is a place where they will be safe from imprinting, thanks to Alpha. Caroline requests that Topher make a copy of her personality to help others find the way there in case she's killed or another group of people finds the Dollhouse. Saunders explains that Topher no longer enters the imprinting room, but she volunteers to make the copy herself. As preparations to leave the Dollhouse are underway, DeWitt notes that Echo has returned to save the actives, but asks what her plans are for the former Dollhouse administrative staff. Caroline cocks her pistol and the memory ends.|$|E
40|$|SummaryThe {{bacterial}} toxin pneumolysin is released as a soluble monomer that kills target cells by assembling into large oligomeric rings and forming pores in cholesterol-containing membranes. Using cryo-EM and image processing, we have determined {{the structures of}} membrane-surface bound (prepore) and inserted-pore oligomer forms, providing a direct observation of the conformational transition into the pore form of a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin. In the pore structure, the domains of the monomer separate and double over into an arch, forming a <b>wall</b> <b>sealing</b> the bilayer around the pore. This transformation is accomplished by substantial refolding {{of two of the}} four protein domains along with deformation of the membrane. Extension of protein density into the bilayer supports earlier predictions that the protein inserts β hairpins into the membrane. With an oligomer size of up to 44 subunits in the pore, this assembly creates a transmembrane channel 260 Å in diameter lined by 176 β strands...|$|E

Thus, the cells are unable to receive oxygen and, as a consequence, are affected by acute hypoxemic hypoxia. The brain suffers because of the hypoxemic state, the subject become unconscious and then respiration arrest occurs, followed by cardiac arrest. This is the physio pathological mechanism leading to death.

40|$|Lap-Protector · Circular stapler · Pancreatic pseudocyst Lap-Protector, {{which is}} an {{abdominal}} <b>wall</b> <b>sealing</b> device, is usually used for wound protection from implantation of malignant cells or pyogenic fluid. A circular stapler is a common easy-to-use device for anastomosis of the digestive tract. We report {{the case of an}} infected pancreatic pseudocyst which was treated by surgical procedure using these useful devices. A 69 -year-old man was followed up in our hospital after severe acute pancreatitis. He had undergone drainage surgeries twice for intractable pancreatic abscess followed by severe acute pancreatitis. He was admitted to our hospital complaining of loss of appetite, hiccups, and high fever. Computed tomography of the abdomen revealed an infected pancreatic pseudocyst which compressed the gastric wall. Internal drainage into the stomach was performed using Lap-Protector and circular stapler. The patient recovered uneventfully. Recently many endoscopic or laparoscopic procedures in cystogastrostomy are reported; however, a conventional open surgical approach is also important. This easy method may be useful for operative cystogastrostomy...|$|E
40|$|This {{project is}} {{in support of}} the PhD project: &# 145;Removal of Inclusions from Liquid Aluminium using Electromagnetically Modified Filtration&# 146;. The purpose of this project was to measure the tortuosity, and {{permeability}} of ~ 50 mm thick: 30, 40, 50 and 80 pores per inch (ppi) commercial alumina ceramic foam filters (CFFs). Measurements have been taken of: cell (pore), window and strut sizes, porosity, tortuosity and liquid permeability. Water velocity from ~ 0. 015 - 0. 77 m/s have been used to derive both first order (Darcy) and second order (Non-Darcy) terms for use with the Forchheimer equation. Experiments were made using 49 mm diameter &# 145;straight through&# 146; and 101 mm diameter &# 145;expanding flow field&# 146; designs. Experimental data are compared with simulation results made using COMSOL 4. 2 a&# 174; 2 D axial symmetric finite element modelling (FEM). Permeability results are correlated using directly measurable parameters. Development of improved <b>wall</b> <b>sealing</b> (49 mm) and elimination of wall effects (101 mm), has lead to a high level of agreement between experimental, analytical and FEM methods (&# 177; 0 - 7 % on predicted pressure drop) for both types of experiments. The liquid permeability experiments were also used to determine the variability of permeability between different filters of the same ppi and permeability variation within the same CFF for changes position. Tortuosity has been determined by two inductive methods, one using cold solidified samples at 60 kHz and the other using liquid metal at 50 Hz, giving comparable results. </p...|$|E

50|$|As {{the only}} speaker {{in the world}} to be in {{continuous}} production for 60 years, the Klipschorn has remained relatively unchanged since its inception. Circa 1970, diode overload protection was added across voice coils to prevent burnout from clipping produced by an overdriven amplifier. The midrange horn was originally made entirely from formed wood. Some fibreglas bells were used on the midrange horn, as well as metal, in the late 1950s. Eventually the midrange horn was changed from metal to braced fiberglass, and the tweeter was front mounted in the 1980s. Both of these changes reduced the already low distortion. In 2005, the company made some minor cosmetic and functional revisions to this legendary speaker, including the elimination of the inset collar, or spacer, between the upper and lower cabinets for a cleaner appearance. A horizontal <b>wall</b> <b>seal</b> was added to improve the low frequency horn's connection to the wall. The crossover, which includes some equalization, was revoiced in the early 2000s.|$|R
