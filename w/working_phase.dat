The research was therefore planned so as to attempt to provide a setting that would maximize improved functioning, while minimizing effects that might hinder effective functioning. Each group of four subjects met for an evening session several days before the experiment. They received instructions and introduced themselves and their unsolved problems to the group. Approximately one hour of pencil-and-paper tests were also administered. At the beginning of the day of the experiment session, subjects were given 200 milligrams of mescaline sulphate (a moderately light dose compared to the doses used in experiments to induce mystical experiences). After some hours of relaxation, subjects were given tests similar to the ones on the introduction day. After the tests, subjects had four hours to work on their chosen problems. After the <b>working</b> <b>phase,</b> the group would discuss their experiences and review the solutions they had come up with. After this, the participants were driven home. Within a week after the session, each participant wrote a subjective account of his experience. Six weeks further, subjects again filled in questionnaires, this time concentrating on the effects on post-session creative ability and the validity and reception of the solutions conceived during the session. This data was in addition to the psychometric data comparing results of the two testing periods.|$|E
40|$|Objective: This study {{examined}} whether {{the provision of}} expressed empathy by therapists increases {{from the beginning to}} the <b>working</b> <b>phase</b> of experiential therapy for depression. It also tested relationships among <b>working</b> <b>phase</b> therapist expressed empathy, the <b>working</b> <b>phase</b> alliance, and clients <b>working</b> <b>phase</b> emotional processing, as well as tested the relationship between therapist expressed empathy and outcome at termination. Method: Therapist expressed empathy was assessed using The Measure of Expressed Empathy, a valid and reliable observer-rated measure. The Working Alliance Inventory, Experiencing Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory were used to measure the alliance, emotional processing and outcome respectively. Results: A paired samples t-test determined that therapists significantly increased their provision of expressed empathy from session one to the first <b>working</b> <b>phase</b> therapy session. A linear regression determined that improvements in therapist empathy were associated with improvements in the working alliance between these sessions. A path analysis found that <b>working</b> <b>phase</b> therapist empathy indirectly predicted outcome by contributing to more favourable <b>working</b> <b>phase</b> alliances, and a trend was found for therapist empathy to indirectly predict <b>working</b> <b>phase</b> emotional processing through the <b>working</b> <b>phase</b> alliance. Conclusion: Therapists do increase in their expression of empathy over the course of experiential therapy. When therapist empathy increases across therapy sessions working alliances tend to improve. Further, higher <b>working</b> <b>phase</b> therapist empathy appears to indirectly contribute to more reductions in depressive symptoms at termination by improving the <b>working</b> <b>phase</b> alliance...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if primary adaptive emotions added to the prediction of therapy outcome above and beyond client depth of experiencing. In an effort to provide an explanatory model, the effect of early-therapy alliance and experiencing on <b>working</b> <b>phase</b> primary adaptive emotions were examined. Individual differences in alliance formation, depth of experiencing, and time spent in primary adaptive emotions were also evaluated. An archival data set of N = 42 individuals who underwent emotion-focused therapy for trauma (EFTT) for childhood maltreatment was used to code time spent in primary adaptive emotions using the Classification of Affective Meaning States (CAMS). The study further made use of alliance and experiencing ratings. All ratings were completed during primary trauma re-experiencing. Participants’ report of interpersonal distress was the index used for therapy outcome. Experiencing in the <b>working</b> <b>phase</b> of therapy, not time spent in primary adaptive emotions, was the best predictor of therapy outcome. Early phase experiencing best-predicted time spent in primary adaptive emotions in the <b>working</b> <b>phase</b> of therapy. From an individual differences standpoint, <b>working</b> <b>phase</b> alliance was the best predictor of therapy outcome for those who had difficulty forming an alliance early in therapy. Depth of experiencing in the <b>working</b> <b>phase</b> of therapy was the best predictor of therapy outcome for those who had difficulty engaging in deepened experiencing early in therapy. The findings of this study suggest that facilitating client experiencing in the <b>working</b> <b>phase</b> of EFTT is important in promoting a good therapy outcome. It further suggests that focusing on the process (i. e. alliance or experiencing) that clients have trouble engaging with early in therapy contributes to the best therapy outcome...|$|E
