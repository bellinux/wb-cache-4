25|$|Catherine did {{initiate}} {{some changes}} to serfdom, though. If a noble {{did not live}} up to his side of the deal, then the serfs could file complaints against him by following the proper channels of law. Catherine gave them this new right, but in exchange they could no longer appeal directly to her. She did this because she did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bothered</b> by the peasantry, but did not want to give them reason to revolt, either. In this act, though, she unintentionally gave the serfs a legitimate bureaucratic status they had lacked before. Some serfs were able to use their new status to their advantage. For example, serfs could apply to be freed if they were under illegal ownership, and non-nobles were not allowed to own serfs. Some serfs did apply for freedom and were, surprisingly, successful. In addition, some governors listened to the complaints of serfs and punished nobles, but this was by no means all-inclusive.|$|E
2500|$|Having {{already been}} linked to his sister Adele on stage, Astaire was {{initially}} very reluctant {{to become part of}} another dance team. He wrote his agent, [...] "I don't mind making another picture with her, but as for this 'team' idea, it's 'out!' I've just managed to live down one partnership and I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bothered</b> with any more." [...] However, he was persuaded by the obvious public appeal of the Astaire-Rogers pairing. The partnership, and the choreography of Astaire and Hermes Pan, helped make dancing an important element of the Hollywood film musical.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{this really}} {{was not a}} cliffhanger, {{the end of the}} fifth episode of the {{original}} Dallas miniseries saw J.R. go up to the loft of the barn to talk to Pam, who had gone up there to find her cousin Jimmy, after Digger had fallen off the wagon at the Ewing barbecue. J.R., intoxicated, tries to convince her to tell Bobby not to leave the ranch. However, she does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bothered,</b> and, in trying to escape J.R., she falls from the loft, landing square on her stomach. Pam, who is pregnant, miscarries her unborn child. Later, Sue Ellen questions J.R. as to whether it was really an accident or did he mean for Pam to fall on purpose. J.R. says, [...] "I did not." [...] When Sue Ellen asks J.R. if he cares that Pam lost the baby, J.R. does not answer her, leaving it up to the viewer to decide.|$|E

60|$|For {{the past}} five years, however, Naomi had lived a tolerably respectable life. When Janet Peterson had died, her idiot daughter, Maggie, had been left with no kin in the world. Nobody knew what <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> done with her, for nobody <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bothered</b> with her. Naomi Clark went to the girl and offered her a home. People said she was no fit person to have charge of Maggie, but {{everybody}} shirked the unpleasant task of interfering in the matter, except Mr. Leonard, who went to expostulate with Naomi, and, as Janet said, for his pains got her door shut in his face.|$|R

[...] "All the rumours that are going around regarding the meeting and my arrest are all false. None of it is true," [...] Fiji Live quoted him as saying.

[...] He denied rumours that two senior officers alleged to have confronted him had been detained in a cell at the Nabua barracks on his orders. There was nothing sinister about the closing of the barracks gates, he said.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study <b>was</b> <b>to</b> develop and test a {{standard}} method of collecting saliva from postoperative patients. Saliva was collected from patients following major abdominal surgery from both parotid glands, in intraoral cups and measured in milliliters. Collection time was measured with a stopwatch and flow rate was calculated by dividing the amount in milliliters by the minutes. Trained research nurses stimulated saliva production with lemon juice and collected saliva at four time points on postoperative day 2. Attrition was 9 % due to ineligibility after enrollment and one withdrawal. In participating patients (n = 68), there were 272 tests planned and 28 % were missing. The reasons were postoperative health problems, hospital discharge, and not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>bothered.</b> When saliva collection attempts were made, three-fourths were successful, but the remainder resulted in “dry mouth. ” Milliliters, minutes, and flow rate were calculated with and without those with dry mouth. Mean flow rates <b>were.</b> 23 <b>to.</b> 33 ml/min excluding those with dry mouth, and. 17 to. 24 ml/min including those with dry mouth. Saliva variables were correlated with antihypertension medications, opioids, opioid side effects, and length of surgery, but correlations were not found consistently at all four time points. The findings suggest that nurse researchers studying biological markers can successfully collect saliva from postoperative patients if they recognize the difficulties and make efforts to minimize and control for them...|$|R

A quick and rather naive answer is that both linguistics and connectionism are branches of cognitive science, the science of human mind.
