40|$|Three {{waterborne}} polyurethane dispersions {{derived from}} polyester, polyether and polycarbonate diols with molecular weight of 1000 Da were synthesized by the acetone method {{and used as}} coatings on stainless steel 304 plates. The properties of the dispersions and the polyurethane films were influenced by the polyol nature. The polyurethanes obtained with polyether or polyester showed higher degree of phase separation between the soft and the hard segment. The higher adhesive strength under shear stresses was obtained in the joints produced with the <b>waterborne</b> <b>dispersion</b> obtained with polycarbonate diol. The properties of the polyurethane coating obtained with polycarbonate diol on stainless steel 304 were significantly higher {{as compared with the}} others. Improved performance of coatings obtained with polycarbonate diol was ascribed to the higher polarity of the carbonate groups that contributed to additional hydrogen bond formation between soft segments with respect to those obtained with polyether or polyester.

When the intermediate bio-based polyhydroxy fatty acid has an OH functionality of 4. 8, the fatty acid can crosslink, and its carboxylic groups {{are able to}} provide surface charge for the stabilization of the resulting polymer in the water phase. Two novel anionic <b>waterborne</b> polyurethane <b>dispersions,</b> one with and one without additional castor oil, were successfully prepared and compared to a conventional control sample.

The castor oil containing polymer displayed a decrease in glass transition temperature, tensile strength, and Young's modulus, but an increase in elongation compared to the control sample. The sample without the castor oil behaved like a brittle, glassy material with higher Young's modulus and lower ductility because of its relatively high crosslinking density.

Increase in acid value, {{the reduction of}} oxygen oxirane content and the color changes shows the grafting process of MA onto epoxy group of ESO. Molecular weight and viscosity of MSO is higher than ESO indicates the inclusion of carboxylic group and the values are increased with increase of MA mole ratio. MSO- 1. 5 was utilized for <b>waterborne</b> <b>dispersion</b> preparation due to its better properties compared with others. The MSO- 1. 5 was dispersed with different amount of deionized water to produce waterborne Maleinated Soybean Oil dispersion (WMSO).

Film surface hardness determined by pencil hardness testing was increased with decreasing of particle size of dispersion. The adhesion of film with glass substrate was poor due to low adhesion with substrate. Through film morphology analysis, smooth surface was observed for all film samples.

In this context many efforts are devoted to the design of photocatalytic paints able to degrade chemical and biological impurities present in air and water. In this work, the photocatalytic activity of hybrid films formed from the blends of pure acrylic or core/shell fluorinated/acrylic <b>waterborne</b> <b>dispersions</b> and photocatalytic titanium dioxide (TiO 2) nanoparticle dispersions was first assessed. The films show photocatalytic activity (inactivation of the Escherichia coli bacteria under UV irradiation) at the substrate-film interface, but very reduced activity in the air-film interface due to the substantially lower amount of the TiO 2 nanoparticles in the vicinity of this interface. In a second step, the fluorinated/(meth) acrylic core-shell hybrid dispersions were used as binders in the formulation of waterborne photocatalytic paints and the stability of the paints, in terms of gloss retain and color change, was assessed during 5000 hours of accelerated weathering tests (QUV-B).

It was found by cryo-TEM analysis that the hybrid dispersions were a mixture of colloidal particles composed of a small fraction of free montmorillonite clay platelets, polymer latex particles, polymer particles to which one or more clay platelets where adhered onto its surface and a fraction of colloidal material consisted of a clay platelet with a polymer lob adhered to either side, in other words hybrid particles with a dumbbell-like morphology. The films made from these <b>waterborne</b> hybrid <b>dispersions</b> presented a homogeneous dispersion of the clay platelets and exfoliated morphology. The shear adhesion failure temperature (SAFT) and shear resistance of the hybrid latex films synthesized with CMA 16 were better than those prepared with a commercial clay (Cloisite 30 B), but presented a liquid-like probe-tack performance. When allyl methacrylate (AMA) was added in the formulation, SAFT and shear resistance improved, but the film had a very low energy of adhesion due to the excessively crosslinked matrix. In order to reduce crosslink density and thus improve the adhesion energy, small amounts of chain transfer agent, in this case n-dodecyl mercaptan (n-DDM), were used in the miniemulsion polymerization process. Adhesive films made from these <b>waterborne</b> hybrid <b>dispersions</b> showed excellent SAFT and shear resistance, and good energy of adhesion.

40|$|In {{comparison}} to weaving or other techniques that are employed to embed conductive tracks in textile fabric structure, the obvious advantages of printing the desired conductive pattern are {{the simplicity of}} the process and the suitability for low volume production runs as well as high volume production runs. However, the generally inferior durability and poorer electrical performance of conductive inks that have been printed onto a textile fabric give rise to challenges. In this study, electrically conductive grades of carbon black pigment were used to formulate screen printing inks for use on textiles. On an equal weight basis, electrically conductive grades impart higher electrical conductivity compared to the printing ink grades of carbon black pigment. However, the conductive grades of carbon black are difficult to disperse and stabilise in aqueous media. Therefore in this study, a procedure was devised initially to prepare stable, <b>waterborne</b> <b>dispersions</b> of a number of highly conductive grades of carbon black pigment. The stability of pigment dispersions was characterised by conducting rheological, particle size and accelerated gravitational sedimentation analyses on appropriate formulations. In order to formulate finished inks from the optimised, stable pigment dispersions, various binders were incorporated in the formulations followed by characterisation of the stability and the electrical properties of the finished inks. Films of the formulated inks were deposited onto various textile substrates. This was followed by testing of the washing and creasing performance of these ink films. It was found that the formulated inks performed considerably better than the tested commercial inks. It was shown that following the ink preparation procedure devised in this study, electrically conductive grades of carbon black pigment can be used to formulate textile printing inks which not only possess very high electrical conductivity but are also durable to withstand washing and creasing of textiles...|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} work {{the results of}} a study {{concerning}} the surface properties of coating materials obtained from fluorinated latices are reported. Better understanding is required regarding the influence of polymer structure, latex composition, and morphology on the surface properties of the resulting films. For this purpose, two commercial fluorinated <b>waterborne</b> polymer <b>dispersions</b> were compared with a model fluorinated acrylic latex purposely synthesized. The surface properties of mold samples, prepared from either the whole solid matter contained in the latices (dried latex) or the purified polymer, were determined by simple contract angle measurements. Two series of homologous liquids, namely H-bonding alcohols and apolar hydrocarbons, were employed for determining the critical surface tension gamma(c) according to the method of Zisman. The results of the surface characterization indicate that the degree of fluorination plays a minor role in these materials, suggesting that the threshold above which the polymer surface is virtually saturated by CF 2 or CF 3 groups might have been largely exceeded.

40|$|Using {{magnetic}} resonance profiling coupled with dynamic light scattering, we {{have investigated the}} mechanisms leading {{to the formation of}} a partly coalesced surface layer, or “open skin”, during film formation from <b>waterborne</b> polymer <b>dispersions.</b> We present the first use of the skewness of the distribution of free water as a model-free indicator of the spatial nonuniformity of drying. The skewness reaches a maximum at the same time at which a strong, static component, presumably originating from a skin at the film/air interface, appears in the light scattering data. Addition of salt to the dispersion increases both the skewness of the distribution of free water and the propensity for skin formation. Surprisingly, the drying is influenced not only by the concentration and valency of the ions in the salt but also by the particular ion. At intermediate particle densities, added salt strongly lowers the cooperative diffusion coefficient, Dcoop. When the particles reach close packing, Dcoop sharply increases. If the particles readily coalesce, the effects of the increased diffusivity will be counteracted, thereby inducing the formation of a skin. A modified Peclet number, Pe, using Dcoop, is proposed, so that the presence of salt is explicitly considered.

Those changes are possibly due to enhancement of crosslinking degree and hydrogen. bonding induced by modified lysozyme. Based on live/dead staining and colonies number assay, the coatings containing lysozyme (2. 5 %, w/w) were highly efficient in killing Staphylococcus aureus (91. 3 %) and Escherichia coli (62. 9 %) via degradation of cell wall within 2 h, and the colonies number for both strains was significantly decreased to less than 1 % after intubation for 24 h.

Other {{variables such as}} the chain extension temperature, the sequence of addition of the chain extender {{with respect to the}} dispersion step and the utilization of a catalyst (triethylamine, TEA) were investigated as well. It was found that EDA extended the NCO-functional prepolymer chains at both 30 and 50 °C, independent of the moment of its addition. A limited extent of chain extension by ADH was observed, which was thought to be caused by the low solubility of ADH in the solvent 2 -butanone, used for the prepolymer synthesis. ADH chain extension only took place after removal of the 2 -butanone. Water chain extension was observed at temperatures ranging from 50 °C to 70 °C. A good balance was found at 50 °C, where a stable dispersion with a relatively high molecular weight, a small particle size and a narrow particle size distribution were obtained. The usage of TEA during the dispersion process promoted the water chain extension reaction, however, at the cost of dispersion stability.

40|$|<b>Waterborne</b> {{polyurethane}} <b>dispersion</b> (PUD) was synthesized {{by using}} inverse dispersion prepolymer technique. A prepolymer mixture of isophorone diisocyanate and polypropylene glycol was extended with five types of chain extenders. The first two types {{are from the}} amine based chain extenders which are ethylene diamine and hydrazine; the other three are diol based chain extenders, one from a petroleum based diol which is ethylene glycol {{and the other two}} from renewable resources which are castor oil (CO) and palm oil based-polyols (POP). In attempt to reduce the toxicity by replacing the toxic amine based chain extender with diols. Furthermore, renewable resources chain extenders were used to decrease dependency on petroleum which is an expensive and depletable resources. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy analysis showed that all samples have been successfully synthesized into PUDs, based on the absorption peaks at 1537 - 1539 cm- 1 and 1718 - 1725 cm- 1 which corresponded to the NH and carbonyl peaks of urethane respectively and also the absence of -NCO peak at 2275 cm- 1. Palm oil-based PUD has the highest viscosity of 5. 4 cP, particle size of 1. 738 micron but low solid content of 31 wt%. The oil based chain extended polyurethane exhibited better thermal stability {{than the rest of the}} samples. This is assumed due to the hydroxyl group of the triglycerides which may react with isocyanate at high temperature to produce crosslink polyurethane. However, the oil based chain extended samples were sticky upon drying and has potential to be used as adhesives...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of linseed oil (LO) -based <b>waterborne</b> polyurethane <b>dispersion</b> (PUD) wood coatings using different curing processes, {{as well as}} their coating and film properties, were examined. The waterborne prepolymer was synthesized first from modified linseed oil (MLO), dimethylol propionic acid (DMPA), isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI) and hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) using an acetone process to prepare a solvent-borne prepolymer with Cdouble bond; length as m-dashC bonds derived from methacrylic acid and fatty acids. The prepolymer was subsequently neutralized with triethylamine (TEA) and dispersed in water. After removing acetone, PUD was obtained. The results showed that the PUD could be readily synthesized and that it possessed reactive double bonds derived from HEMA and LO. Wood coatings were formulated by mixing PUD with photoinitiator for UV curing alone or by mixing PUD with metal dryers for air drying alone or by combining PUD with the two formulations as UV/air and air/UV dual-cured systems. The waterborne wood coatings were cured through different curing processes, as previously mentioned, and the properties of the cured films were characterized. The results showed that the durability and the lightfastness of films prepared using the UV/air dual-curing process (i. e., first UV-cured, followed by air drying) were better than those of the coatings cured using UV alone. Furthermore, the poor adhesion of the films cured using UV alone was significantly improved through the use of the UV/air dual-curing system. In conclusion, the linseed-oil-based waterborne UV/air dual-cured coatings possess the potential to provide high-efficiency, high-performance and environmentally friendly coatings for furniture finishing and it is a candidate for the application of coatings in the wood industry...|$|R
40|$|A novel anti-biofouling coating was {{designed}} and prepared by directly mixing antifouling enzymes (lipase or protease) with a castor oil-based <b>waterborne</b> polyurethane (WPU) <b>dispersion.</b> Covalent incorporation of the enzymes into the WPU coating was realized via {{the reaction of the}} excessive NCO groups in WPU and the NH 2 groups in the enzyme molecules as investigated using enzyme leaking and IR analysis. The incorporation of the enzymes had a plasticization effect on the WPU coating, e. g. the tensile strength decreased and elongation at break increased after addition of lipase to the WPU coating. SEM images and contact angles (CAs) analysis showed that the enzymes were evenly distributed in the coating surface. The enzymatic WPU coatings displayed robust catalytic capabilities, e. g. 70 % initial activity after ten continuous usages, ca. 50 % initial activity after storage at room temperature for 90 days and ca. 20 % initial activity after incubating at 60 degrees C for 90 days were obtained for the WPU coating containing lipase. Additionally, the enzymatic WPU coating afforded a self-cleaning ability against lipid and protein stains. This robust and environmentally friendly enzymatic WPU coating may provide a new strategy for resisting biomolecular contaminations...|$|R
40|$|Exopolysaccharides (EPS) are a {{class of}} {{renewable}} polymers that show interesting anti-corrosive properties and could potentially {{be used as an}} alternative for zinc phosphates. When combined with a <b>waterborne</b> styrene-acrylic polymer <b>dispersion</b> (SA- 1), exopolysaccharides were shown to give an improvement in the anti-corrosive performance. Electrochemical studies show higher charge transfer resistance (Rct) values for the SA- 1 /EPS combinations as compared to the SA- 1 itself suggesting that in the presence of EPS less corrosion took place. Outdoor exposure test shows that the presence of EPS 188 gave good corrosion protection for up to a year when exposed under marine conditions. The distribution of EPS modification throughout the coating was made visible using Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy and indicated that EPS was distributed rather homogeneously. A working mechanism was proposed in which the carboxylic acid groups on the oxidised EPS form a complex with iron ions formed by the anodic reaction and this insoluble complex forms a protective layer between the coating and metal. The results in this paper show that by using renewable polysaccharide additives the anti-corrosive coating performance can be improved...|$|R
40|$|Though {{polymers}} {{exist for}} many years, crystallization by homogeneous nucleation has seldom been studied. To explore {{this kind of}} nucleation, polyolefin-water matrix systems have been developed. Low-viscosity, not-vitrified water {{is not expected to}} influence the crystallization of the polyolefin; it is safer to work with than with any organic solvent; it is completely inert from an environmental point of view, and therefore potentially of interest for industrial applications. Usually, polymer crystallization occurs by way of heterogeneous nucleation because in a polymer a large number of heterogeneous nuclei is present, facilitating the crystallization process. However, in case these nuclei are absent or when somehow they are removed, homogeneous crystallization can occur. Hence, if the polymer is dispersed into a large enough number of particles {{the vast majority of them}} will not contain any heterogeneous nucleus and thus they must undergo homogenous crystallization. In this work water-borne dispersions of a maleic anhydride-grafted, isotactic polypropylene (MA-g-PP) covering a very wide range of particle size distributions were successfully prepared. The dispersions proved to be stable over very long periods of time and over a broad range of temperatures. Thus, by varying the nucleation density in droplets by changing their dimensions, the different modes of crystallization sought - heterogeneous, fractionated and homogenous crystallization - have indeed been found, enabling the study of the various modes. The particle size distributions of these <b>waterborne</b> MA-g-PP <b>dispersions</b> have been determined and compared to the crystallization (from the melt) and subsequent melting behavior. The larger-particle dispersions showed crystallization at the usual (bulk) crystallization temperatures; dispersions having intermediate-size particles showed several ways of fractionated crystallization, and the smaller-particle dispersions showed crystallization exclusively at a very high, extra supercooling resulting from homogeneous nucleation. The obtained lowest crystallization temperature - 34 ºC - was the lowest ever reported for isotactic polypropylene (iPP), and has only recently been realized by two other groups. The obtained particle size distributions cover approximately three orders of magnitude, with size averages ranging from less than 100 nm up to a few tens of micrometers. Such a complete set of samples is seldom available and it constitutes a solid base for the research work carried out. Next, a deeper analysis of the process of crystal formation was undertaken. Self-nucleation was successfully used in order to confirm that fractionated and homogenous crystallization were due to the increased number of droplets as compared to the number of active impurities. However, due to the vast number of droplets in the dispersions having the smallest particles it was necessary to use extremely low self-nucleation temperatures in order to change all different crystallization modes into crystallization in the bulk, heterogeneous crystallization temperature range. Most remarkably, in this case the self-nucleation regimes II and III - as defined and used in literature - overlap. Concerning the density of nucleating seeds, a novel procedure that takes into account the entire size distribution was proposed for the estimation of that density. The results show that the nucleation density in the dispersions is always larger than in bulk, even when polymer dispersions that crystallize exclusively in the bulk crystallization temperature range are considered. Besides, the number of less active nucleating seeds was also estimated, as well as the required particle size in order not to observe any crystallization until the homogenous crystallization temperature has been reached. It turns out that the size of the dispersed droplets has to be drastically reduced to sub-micrometer dimensions in order to obtain homogenous crystallization exclusively. Then, an analysis of the kinetics of the crystallization process was performed in order to establish which type of primary nucleation takes place at each crystallization temperature. The originality of the proposed and performed analysis consists in taking into consideration the particle size distribution of the samples, and not just an average particle size, as it is commonly done. It was possible to conclude that no impurity is involved in the primary nucleation observed at the maximum supercooling. Moreover, the results of the analysis favor the possibility of volume nucleation over surface nucleation. Finally, the mesomorphic phase of isotactic polypropylene has been studied. The enthalpy of the mesophase was determined over a wide temperature range, on the basis of a number of reasonable assumptions. Next, the enthalpy of crystallization/fusion obtained has been used to fully characterize the samples regarding the crystallinity and polymorph evolution as function of temperature. The morphology of the different crystal phases observed was analyzed too, showing interesting but sometimes contradicting results.

40|$|<b>Waterborne</b> {{polyurethane}} urea <b>dispersions</b> (WPUUs) {{intended for}} coatings and adhesives were synthesized with mixtures of polyester polyol (PE) and polycarbonate diol (PCD) for combining {{the advantages of}} the polyurethane ureas made with pure polyols. WPUUs made with mixtures of polyols had higher mean particle size and lower viscosity than the ones made with one polyol only. Two types of hard segments totally separated (i. e. −(IPDI-DMPA/TEA-IPDI) - and −(IPDI-HZ-IPDI) -) and two types of soft segments (i. e. −(IPDI-PCD-IPDI) - and −(IPDI-PE-IPDI) -) were produced in polyurethane ureas made with PE + PCD mixtures. The segmented structure and phase separation of the polyurethane ureas made with PE + PCD mixtures differed depending on their PCD content, affecting the thermal, rheological and crystallinity properties. The adhesion of chlorinated vulcanized styrene-butadiene rubber/WPUU/roughened leather joints made with WPUUs prepared with PE + PCD mixtures was very similar to the ones made with PCD and PE only. After ageing in water at 70 °C for 1 - 2 days, the adhesive strength of joints made with WPUUs containing more than 50 wt% PCD is excellent. The properties of the polyurethane ureas made with mixtures of polyols containing 50 wt% or more PCD were determined by lower degree of phase separation and interactions between hard and soft domains via carbonate groups.

40|$|Different {{aliphatic}} <b>waterborne</b> polyurethane <b>dispersions</b> (PUDs) were synthesized {{by using}} different polyols (Mw: 1000 Da) of randomly copolymerized polycarbonate diols with hexamethylene and pentamethylene (C 6 –C 5), tetramethylene (C 6 –C 4) and trimethylene (C 6 –C 3); these copolymers differed in {{the length of}} the methylene groups and the structural regularity due to the combination of even and odd units. Brookfield viscosity, extent of particle crowding and broadening of the particle size distribution of the PUD synthesized with C 6 –C 4 polyol followed a different trend than for the other because of the even number of methylene units in the polyol. The PUDs showed monomodal particle size distribution which was narrower in C 6 –C 4 (i. e. the dispersion with higher structural regularity) and the mean particle size decreased by decreasing {{the length of the}} methylene unit of the copolymer. The properties of the polyurethanes were affected by the phase separation between the hard and soft segments, the more regular packing of even methylene units in the copolymer and the crystallized polar segments due to carbonate groups. Thus, the glass transition values of the soft segments in the polyurethanes were similar because of the more regular packing of even methylene units in C 6 –C 4 polyol and the crystallized segments produced by interactions of carbonate groups. PU(C 6 –C 5) and PU(C 6 –C 4) showed similar degree of phase separation, the higher degree of phase separation corresponded to PU(C 6 –C 3). Furthermore, the crystallinity of the polyurethanes increased with decreasing the number of methylene units in the polyol, but PU(C 6 –C 4) was the most crystalline because of the more regularly packed even methylene groups in the polyol chain. The thermal stability of the polyurethanes increased from PU(C 6 –C 5) to PU(C 6 –C 3) because the more net interactions between the carbonate groups in the soft segments. The lower was the number of methylene groups between carbonate units in the copolymer, the higher was the elastic modulus of the polyurethanes. The tensile strength and elongation-at-break values of the polyurethanes increased by increasing the number of methylene groups between carbonate units in the copolymer. Finally, the peel strength was maximal in the joint made with PU(C 6 –C 5) and the shear strength was the highest in the joint made with PU(C 6 –C 3), in agreement with the variation of the viscoelastic and mechanical properties of the polyurethanes.
