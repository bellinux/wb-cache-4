5|$|In 2002, Christopher McQuarrie visited Berlin while researching {{another project}} and visited the {{memorial}} to von Stauffenberg at the Bendlerblock. Researching the 20 July plot, {{he was moved}} and fascinated {{by the fact that}} the conspirators were fully aware of <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> they failed their assassination attempt, and he wanted to make their story more well-known. He approached Nathan Alexander to co-write the film, and Alexander began researching the project. McQuarrie sought to model the story after the 2001 TV film Conspiracy, which depicted the Wannsee Conference at which the Nazis planned the Final Solution. He also sought to direct the film, until he realized that adequate financing would only be secured with Bryan Singer directing.|$|E
40|$|This brief {{summarizes}} {{findings from}} a recent study using national data and a propensity score matching approach to examine the overall effects of FWS participation for students enrolled at four-year institutions, {{as well as its}} effects under two conditional counterfactuals: <b>What</b> <b>would</b> have <b>happened</b> <b>if</b> the recipient had worked a non-FWS job?

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} debate, Kennedy asked Phillips <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> Nhu {{responded to the}} cuts by {{diverting}} money away from the army to prop up his personal schemes. When Kennedy asked if Nhu would blame the US for any resulting military deterioration, Phillips replied that the ARVN would revolt, because the ARVN officers who were on Viet Cong hit lists would not allow the communists to run loose. Phillips said that if Nhu tried to divert military aid away from the troops to prop up his personal schemes, the Americans could deliver the money straight to the countryside in suitcases.|$|E

25|$|The Kaldor–Hicks {{methods are}} {{typically}} used as tests of potential improvements {{rather than as}} efficiency goals themselves. They are used to determine whether an activity moves the economy toward Pareto efficiency. Any change usually makes some people better off and others worse off, so these tests consider <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> gainers were to compensate losers.|$|E

25|$|In {{compensation}} for this loss, Muhammad Ali asked the Porte for {{the territory of}} Syria. The Ottomans were indifferent to the request; the Sultan himself asked blandly <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> Syria was given over and Muhammad Ali later deposed. But Muhammad Ali was no longer willing to tolerate Ottoman indifference. To compensate for his and Egypt's losses, the wheels for the conquest of Syria were set in motion.|$|E

The movie depicted <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> the United States were destroyed in a nuclear war. The movie was filmed in Lawrence, and hundreds of local residents appeared in the film as extras and in speaking roles.|$|E

25|$|The {{ideas for}} Flowers for Algernon {{developed}} over 14years and {{were inspired by}} events in Keyes's life, starting in 1945 with Keyes's conflict with his parents who were pushing him through a pre-medical education despite his desire to pursue a writing career. Keyes felt that his education was driving a wedge {{between him and his}} parents, and this led him to wonder <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> it were possible to increase a person's intelligence.|$|E
25|$|On 3 July 2006 Shalit's captors made an {{ultimatum}} {{according to which}} they demanded that Israel must fulfill all of its demands by 4 July 2006 at 6:00am.

After the ultimatum period expired the Army of Islam group announced that no more information would be released about Shalit's fate.|$|E
25|$|The {{discrepancies}} {{in the various}} figures {{can be attributed to}} several factors: first of all, entire families were killed, and many of the survivors were subsequently scattered across the country. The absence of relatives made tallying the dead more difficult, as did the severe warnings the villagers received in the immediately ensuing years about <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> they discussed the massacre. The fact that many of the victims were burnt alive in a single, small enclosure complicated the identification of remains and, to date, it is not certain that all the clandestine graves in the vicinity of Plan de Sánchez have been found.|$|E

25|$|In 1968 {{the family}} {{relocated}} to Bath, Ohio. Two years later, over a family meal of chicken, Dahmer asked his father <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> {{the bones of}} the chicken were to be placed in a bleach solution. Lionel Dahmer was, by this stage, concerned as to his elder son's placid and lethargic attitude and his solitary existence; therefore, he was delighted at the initiative displayed by his son towards what he believed to be scientific curiosity. He willingly demonstrated to his son how to safely bleach and (later) preserve animal bones. This knowledge regarding the cleansing and preserving of bones would be used by Dahmer on many of the animal remains which he continued to avidly collect.|$|E
25|$|On 15 June 2016, Vote Leave {{presented}} its roadmap {{to lay out}} <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> Britain {{left the}} EU.

25|$|In the {{original}} Legend of Gunung Ledang, Sultan Mahmud of Malacca sends his emissary, Hang Tuah, to Gunung Ledang {{to present his}} royal proposal of marriage to the mystical Princess of Mount Ledang. The Princess and Hang Tuah are independently famous figures of Malayan history-mythology, {{and it is only}} in this specific story that the two briefly cross paths, though in some versions of the tale it is Tun Mamat, not Tuah, who presents the proposal to the Princess as Tuah was too old and weak to reach the mountain peak. The original concept of the Puteri Gunung Ledang, as pitched by Mamat Khalid, was to pose the question of <b>what</b> <b>would</b> <b>happen</b> <b>if</b> these two characters had met and fallen in love.|$|E
