5|$|After {{the rest}} day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 runs with six wickets in hand. The morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages. In 88 minutes of play, Australia added a further 117 runs. Brown was caught behind from Coxon for 32 after an 87-run {{partnership}} with Miller, bringing Lindwall to the crease. Miller's innings was {{noted for its}} driving and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> for 74, followed by Lindwall for 25, Bradman declared with Australia at 460/7, 595 runs ahead. It would take a world record chase from England to win the match. Yardley and Laker {{had been the only}} multiple wicket-takers, with two each.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} manager of Rushden & Diamonds in December 2006, {{with the club}} sitting 22nd in the table, two points adrift of safety. Westley's first game in charge of Rushden was a 1–0 victory away at Cambridge United, as he set about ensuring safety. Westley secured the signatures of several players who he had previously managed at Stevenage; signing the likes of Jamie Cook, David Perpetuini, and Dino Maamria. Westley also brought in the likes of Michael Bostwick and Chris Beardsley – younger players who he had previously written about in his weekly column in The Non-League Paper <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of work. Westley's newly assembled team secured five straight wins in the league, including wins away at the top two {{teams in the league}} at the time, Oxford United and Dagenham & Redbridge. Despite managing an upturn {{in the form of the}} club, Westley was surprisingly sacked after a 2–2 draw at Aldershot Town in February 2007. He had taken the club from 22nd in the league to 12th in the space of two and a half months, and the club were on a seven-match unbeaten run at the time. In all, he managed Rushden for 13 games; winning seven, drawing three and losing three. The reason behind Westley's sacking is unknown, but he was replaced two days later by Garry Hill.|$|E

25|$|The World XI {{never looked}} like {{challenging}} this total. They lost five of their top six batsmen — Sehwag, Kallis, Lara, Dravid and Pietersen — for single figures, to collapse to 5 for 82 inside 22 overs. Only Sangakkara's innings gave any hope, but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> for 65 {{to leave the}} World XI on 6 for 101, needing 7 runs an over off the last 22 overs, the game was over. Australia eventually wrapped up the World XI's innings for 162 to record a comprehensive 93-run victory.|$|E
25|$|As a {{young man}} Gladstone had treated his father's estate, Fasque, in Forfarshire, {{southwest}} of Aberdeen, as home, but as a younger son he would not inherit it. Instead, {{from the time of}} his marriage, he lived at his wife's family's estate at Hawarden in Flintshire, Wales. He never actually owned Hawarden, which belonged first to his brother-in-law Sir Stephen Glynne, and was then inherited by Gladstone's eldest son in 1874. During the late 1840s, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of office, he worked extensively to turn Hawarden into a viable business.|$|E
25|$|On 23rd June 2017, in a Twenty20 {{match against}} South Africa, Jason Roy of England was given out obstructing the field, for {{changing}} {{the side of the}} pitch he was running on when returning from backing up. This caused the returned ball to hit him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of his crease, when it could conceivably have hit the stumps. The South African fielders immediately appealed for a dismissal. Responding to this, the on-field umpires called the ball dead and referred the decision to the third umpire, who gave Roy out.|$|E

25|$|Umaga {{returned}} to New Zealand {{at the end}} of his contract with Toulon following their 7 January 2007 win over Grenoble. When Umaga arrived in Toulon they were ninth in the Pro D2 table; when he left they had risen to third. Toulon won eight of nine matches with Umaga on the roster – the only loss coming <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> injured. Umaga played his last season for the Hurricanes in 2007. His last match for them was on 5 May 2007 at Wellington's Westpac Stadium. On 25 September 2007, Umaga released a book detailing his career.|$|E
25|$|The ODI fifty against Australia {{would turn}} out to be his {{penultimate}} – indeed, he only passed 35 once again, in the 1983 World Cup against Pakistan. However, it took him 127 balls, and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> at 162 for 3 Sri Lanka needed plenty of runs quickly. Despite a blitzing 26 from Ranjan Madugalle, Sri Lanka lost too many wickets to Abdul Qadir, and fell 11 runs short. After this, Wettimuny suffered a poor run of form, only scoring 115 runs at an average of 12.77 in the following nine matches. He was dropped from the team after the 1984–85 World Series Cup, but returned for one last match against India in 1986–87. He made 14 before being bowled by Raju Kulkarni.|$|E
25|$|Tim Bresnan's {{onslaught of}} fast bowling {{resulted}} in three quick wickets for Yorkshire Phoenix, {{yet he was}} only called upon to bowl three overs – for 22 runs – and Nottinghamshire Outlaws were let off the hook. Chris Read top-scored with 43 off 35, propelling the hosts to 170 for 8. An excellent start by Ian Harvey and Michael Lumb sent Yorkshire to 60 for 1, as Harvey found boundaries seemingly at will – <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> for 74 (with 64 of them in boundaries), however, Yorkshire imploded from 121 for 2 to 135 for 6. Craig White and Ismail Dawood fought back, and number 10 Richard Dawson won them the match with a two and a four, as Yorkshire needed four runs from the last three deliveries of the game.|$|E

25|$|This is {{the third}} time that he has taken 10 wickets in a match in his test career. South Africa duly {{completed}} the chase with nine wickets in hand, giving them a 2–0 series lead and their first ever Test series win in Australia. It was also Australia's first home series defeat in 16 years. Steyn was named man of the match for this performance. Steyn made a rearguard effort in attempting to prevent an Australian victory in the 3rd Test in Sydney frustrating the hosts with 28 runs in 65 balls in a 50 run partnership from 105 balls with Makhaya Ntini {{in order to try}} to secure the draw. However, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> with 50 balls to go, injured captain Graeme Smith came in with a broken hand in an attempt to hold out. Smith was eventually bowled out by Mitchell Johnson with ten balls to go.|$|E
25|$|For years, Amahl was {{presented}} live, but in 1963 it was videotaped by NBC with conductor Herbert Grossman and an all-new cast featuring Kurt Yaghjian as Amahl, Martha King as The Mother, and John McCollum, Willis Patterson, and Richard Cross as the Three Kings. When Menotti {{found out that}} NBC had scheduled the taping on a date <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of the country, {{he tried to get}} the date changed. The network refused and recorded the 1963 performance without the composer's presence or participation, telecasting it in December 1963, and twice more after that — in 1964 and 1965. Menotti never approved of the 1963 production, and in May 1966 when the rights to future broadcasts reverted to him, the composer refused to allow it to be shown again. Because of this, Amahl was not shown on television at all between 1966 and 1978.|$|E
25|$|It {{seemed that}} no one in the Channel Nine box could make a comment about him that wasn't negative. His feet, hands, {{technique}} and temperament were questioned. His second-innings 46 was not enough. And they weren't always wrong. It just seemed kind of mean. Especially when at the back of the press box some seemed happy <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>out.</b> But it went deeper than McNamara's comments. Bailey had made mistakes in his career. He hadn't made enough first-class runs. He hadn't come into the team as a young man. He came into the captaincy without playing a game. He came into the Test team because of one-day runs. He was everything old-school cricket didn't like. A thinking cricketer who had never demanded inclusion, but who had been included regardless. For old-school types like Ian Chappell, he was pretty much everything he didn't like. And Chappell wasn't just turning on Bailey because of his stoush with Channel Nine. He had not liked Bailey for a long time.|$|E

25|$|This {{match was}} {{scheduled}} in the England tour programme {{to be played}} between the touring team and {{the winner of the}} Australian Domestic One-Day Cricket Final. In those days New Zealand cricket team played alongside the Australian states and won in 1969-70, 1972–73 and 1974–75, however as they were playing as a domestic side the match was not a One Day International. Denness won the toss and fielded, but saw New Zealand make 262/8 off their 40 overs with most batsmen chipping in and John Morrison top-scoring with 49 and the wicketkeeper Ken Wadsworth making 44. Tony Greig was the best bowler with 2/46 and top-scored in the MCC innings, thrashing 79 of 75 balls after coming in a 47/4 when Hedley Howarth took three top order wickets with his 3/24. Greig added 92 with Keith Fletcher (44), but wickets fell regularly thereafter and <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> at 192/9 the match was all but over. New Zealand won by 66 runs, but Greig had the consolation of being the man of the match.|$|E
25|$|Since 2007, Harriet Harman {{has been}} Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, the UK's current {{opposition}} party. Traditionally, being Deputy Leader has ensured the cabinet role of Deputy Prime Minister. However, Gordon Brown {{announced that he}} would not have a Deputy Prime Minister, much to the consternation of feminists, particularly with suggestions that privately Brown considered Jack Straw to be de facto deputy prime minister and thus bypassing Harman. With Harman's cabinet post of Leader of the House of Commons, Brown allowed her to chair Prime Minister's Questions <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of the country. Harman also held the post Minister for Women and Equality. In April 2012 after being sexually harassed on London public transport English journalist Laura Bates founded the Everyday Sexism Project, a website which documents everyday examples of sexism experienced by contributors from around the world. The site quickly became successful and a book compilation of submissions from the project was published in 2014. In 2013, the first oral history archive of the United Kingdom women’s liberation movement (titled Sisterhood and After) was launched by the British Library.|$|E
25|$|In October 1970, when Genie was {{approximately}} 13 years and 6 months old, Genie's parents had a violent argument {{in which her}} mother threatened to walk out if she could not call her own parents. Her husband eventually relented, and later that day she left with Genie <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> {{of the house and}} went to her parents in Monterey Park; Genie's brother, by then 18, had already run away from home and was living with friends. Around three weeks later, on November 4, Genie's mother decided to apply for disability benefits for the blind in nearby Temple City, California and brought Genie with her, but on account of her near-blindness Genie's mother accidentally entered the general social services office next door. The social worker who greeted them instantly sensed something was wrong when she saw Genie and was shocked to learn her true age, having estimated from her appearance and demeanor that she was around 6 or 7 and possibly autistic, and after she and her supervisor questioned Genie's mother and confirmed Genie's age they immediately contacted the police. Genie's parents were arrested and Genie became a ward of the court, and due to her physical condition and near-total unsocialized state a court order was immediately issued for Genie to be taken to Children's Hospital Los Angeles.|$|E

He made his debut for Derbyshire in May 1903 against MCC <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> for a duck in both innings and took the only wicket in the second innings before MCC won. He played six matches in 1903 taking a total of 3 wickets with a top score of 22. However in 1904 he played 17 matches, but only took six wickets and made a top score of 56. In 1905 his bowling picked up {{and he started to}} improve his run total, but it was 1907 before he managed his first 5 wicket innings. He managed another 5 wicket innings in 1908 but in 1909 took five 5-wicket innings with a best {{performance}} of 6–38. In 1910 against Hampshire he took 8 for 117 in the first innings and 2 wickets in the second to make it a 10 wicket match. In the whole season he achieved ten 5 wicket innings and three 10 wicket matches. In 1911 he managed his best bowling performance of 9 for 71 against Nottinghamshire and scored his first century against Hampshire. He took seven 5-wicket innings in 1912 with a best performance of 7 for 16 and five in 1913 with a best performance of 7 for 43. In 1913 he took three 5-wicket innings and made a top performance of 6 for 95. In 1912, 1913 and 1914 he played occasional games for MCC.|$|E
500|$|After {{the end of}} his {{seagoing}} naval career Rupert {{continued to}} be actively involved in both government and science, although he was increasingly removed from current politics. To the younger members of the court the prince appeared increasingly distant—almost from a different era. Count Grammont described Rupert as [...] "brave and courageous even to rashness, but cross-grained and incorrigibly obstinate... he was polite, even to excess, unseasonably; but haughty, and even brutal, when he ought to have been gentle and courteous... his manners were ungracious: he had a dry hard-favoured visage, and a stern look, even when he wished to please; but, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of humour, he was the true picture of reproof". Rupert's health during this period was also less robust; his head wound from his employment in France required a painful trepanning treatment, his leg wound continued to hurt and he still suffered from the malaria he had caught while in the Gambia.|$|E
