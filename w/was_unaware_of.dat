5|$|After moving in, Moon began a {{prescribed}} course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He {{wanted to get}} sober, but due to his fear of psychiatric hospitals {{he wanted to do}} it at home. Clomethiazole is discouraged for unsupervised detoxification because of its addictive potential, its tendency to induce tolerance, and its risk of death when mixed with alcohol. The pills were prescribed by Geoffrey Dymond, a physician who <b>was</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> Moon's lifestyle. Dymond prescribed a bottle of 100 pills, instructing him to take one pill when he felt a craving for alcohol but not more than three pills per day.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Background: This study {{investigated}} which patient socio-demographic factors {{are associated with}} being <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> their chronic disease. METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from the Point of Care Testing in General Practice Trial studying patients with diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia and cardiovascular disease requiring anticoagulation. Patient questionnaires were compared with their general practitioner's records. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed, determining which patients {{were more likely to}} <b>be</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> their chronic disease. RESULTS: A large proportion <b>of</b> patients <b>were</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> their chronic diseases (27 % with hyperlipidaemia, 15 % prescribed anticoagulation, 5 % with diabetes). Patient factors associated with being unaware include residing in rural or remote regions of Australia. DISCUSSION: Self management, a pillar of chronic disease management, is unachievable if patients <b>are</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> their condition. At practice and policy levels, identifying then targeting patients most likely to <b>be</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> their conditions with evidence based interventions, can facilitate self management.

This view {{is reinforced by the}} rendering of God in the outer panels as a tiny figure in comparison to the immensity of the earth. According to Belting, the three inner panels seek to broadly convey the Old Testament notion that, before the Fall, there was no defined boundary between good and evil; humanity in its innocence <b>was</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> consequence.|$|E
5|$|As Nazi Germany was {{collapsing}} {{towards the}} end of the war, Braun swore loyalty to Hitler and went to Berlin to be by his side in the heavily reinforced Führerbunker beneath the Reich Chancellery. As Red Army troops fought their way into the neighbourhood on 29 April 1945, she married Hitler during a brief civil ceremony; she was 33 and he was 56. Less than 40 hours later, they committed suicide together in a sitting room of the bunker, she by biting into a capsule of cyanide, and he by a gunshot to the head. The German public <b>was</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> Braun's relationship with Hitler until after their deaths.|$|E

5|$|In April 2012, the Boston Herald sparked an {{election}} controversy when it {{drew attention to}} Warren's Association of American Law Schools (AALS) directory entries from 1986 to 1995, which listed her as a minority professor. According to the AALS, the directory was compiled by information supplied by law school deans, based on questionnaires filled out by individual teachers. Warren stated that she had self-identified as having Native American ancestry {{in order to meet}} others with a similar background. Harvard Law School had listed her as a minority professor in response to criticisms about a lack of faculty diversity, but Warren said that she <b>was</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> this until she read about it in a newspaper during the 2012 election.|$|E

5|$|In {{the initial}} {{plans for the}} series, Jack {{was going to die}} midway through the first episode, and then Kate would emerge {{as the leader of the}} survivors. Kate's {{original}} backstory was that her husband went to the bathroom shortly before the plane split in mid-air, and on the Island she would remain adamant that he was alive. However the Lost producers changed their minds about Jack's death; they decided he would become the leader and created a new backstory for Kate. They still liked Kate's original backstory, so they used it for Rose. As Rose is black, the producers thought the audience would expect Rose's husband to also be black, and decided to make Bernard a white character to surprise the audience. They expected the audience to assume Mr. Eko (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), the only black man in the tail-section survivors, was Bernard. L. Scott Caldwell, Rose's portrayer, <b>was</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> their plans and had been picturing her own husband, a tall black man, when playing the scenes. When she found out Bernard was white she was surprised, but not shocked. Sam Anderson <b>was</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> which character he would be playing when he was cast in Lost. During his audition he performed a scene where a man from the plane crash was informed his daughter was still alive, which he noted covered a similar emotion to the scene in which Bernard is told Rose is still alive. Anderson and Caldwell were given a rough idea of how much they would appear at the start of the seasons.|$|E

During the race, {{he was black}} flagged for his dangerous driving style and therefore disqualified; he did not immediately return to the pit lane as he <b>was</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> the regulations. Rindt entered several rallies with his Simca but did not achieve good results. It was only when he was provided with a race-prepared Alfa Romeo GT 1300 at cost price and with free servicing by a local dealer that he became more successful. In the Alfa Romeo, he achieved eight victories.|$|E

In actuality, the scene was set on an unnamed island off the coast of Macau, though based on the real-life Hashima. Sam Mendes explained that the location was a hybrid of a set and computer-generated images. Production chose to include the Hashima model after Daniel Craig met with Swedish film-maker Thomas Nordanstad whilst shooting The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in Stockholm. Nordanstad, who produced a short documentary on Hashima Island in 2002 entitled Hashima, recalled Craig taking extensive notes on the island {{at the time of the}} meeting, but <b>was</b> <b>unaware</b> <b>of</b> his interest in it until Skyfall was released.|$|E
