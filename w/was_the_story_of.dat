5|$|Whale {{directed}} his final film in 1950, a short subject {{based on the}} William Saroyan one-act play Hello Out There. The film, financed by supermarket heir Huntington Hartford, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> {{a man in a}} Texas jail falsely accused of rape and the woman who cleans the jail. Hartford intended for the short to be part of an anthology film along the lines of Quartet. However, attempts to find appropriate short fiction companion pieces to adapt were unsuccessful and Hello Out There was never commercially released.|$|E
5|$|In 1893, Matilda Joslyn Gage {{took time}} {{out from her}} {{participation}} in the Revising Committee to write Woman, Church and State, a book which challenged traditional Judeo-Christian teaching that women were the source of sin, and that sex was sinful. Gage wrote that the double standard for morality hurt both sexes. Gage differed {{from most of the}} women on the Revising Committee in that she did not feel that the Bible, once interpreted in a more true, original form, would support women's rights. Gage determined that the Church had acted against women's interests in important ways: from Roman Catholic canon law, to Scripture, to its advocacy of celibacy and more. Especially troubling to Gage <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> Adam and Eve.|$|E
5|$|In early 1950, Disney {{produced}} Cinderella, his studio's first animated {{feature in}} eight years. It was popular with critics and theater audiences. Costing $2.2million to produce, it earned nearly $8million {{in its first}} year. Disney was less involved {{than he had been}} with previous pictures because of his involvement in his first entirely live-action feature, Treasure Island (1950), which was shot in Britain, as <b>was</b> <b>The</b> <b>Story</b> <b>of</b> Robin Hood and His Merrie Men (1952). Other all-live-action features followed, many of which had patriotic themes. He continued to produce full-length animated features too, including Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Peter Pan (1953). From the early to mid-1950s, Disney began to devote less attention to the animation department, entrusting most of its operations to his key animators, the Nine Old Men, although he was always present at story meetings. Instead, he started concentrating on other ventures.|$|E

25|$|Borovansky's next ballet, The Black Swan, {{also had}} an Australian theme. It {{was based on a}} {{historical}} incident in 1697 when Captain Vlaming from the Dutch East India Company was exploring Australia. He discovered and named Rottnest Island and the river on which the city of Perth now stands. There were a large number of black swans on the river which drew Captain Vlamingh's attention and his crew captured several and took them back to Java. Thus, the main plot of the ballet <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> the Captain entranced by a black swan, which symbolised a new land. The ballet premiered in Melbourne in the Borovansky Ballet's 1949 season. The work was revived both in 1950 and 1951.|$|E

In this story, Titus and Gisippus are inseparable until Gisippus {{falls in love with}} Sophronia. He introduces her to Titus, but Titus is overcome with jealousy, and vows to seduce her. Upon hearing of Titus' plan, Gisippus arranges for them to change places on the wedding night, thus placing their friendship above his love.|$|E
25|$|In {{desperate need}} of money, Anger wrote a book titled Hollywood Babylon in which he {{collected}} together gossip regarding celebrities, some of which he claims he had been told. This included claiming (with no corroboration or citing of sources) that Rudolph Valentino liked to play a sexually submissive role to dominant women, that Walt Disney was a drug user, addicted to opiates (reflected {{in the character of}} Goofy, who's perpetually stoned on cannabis), as well as describing the nature of the deaths of Peg Entwistle and Lupe Vélez. The work was not published in the United States initially, and it was first released by the French publisher Jean Jacques Pauvert. A pirated (and incomplete) version was first published in the U.S. in 1965, with the official American version not being published until 1974. Now with some financial backing from the publication of Hollywood Babylon, his next film project <b>was</b> <b>The</b> <b>Story</b> <b>of</b> O; essentially a piece of erotica featuring a heterosexual couple engaged in sadomasochistic sexual activities, although it refrained from showing any explicit sexual images.|$|E

25|$|The Vikings {{came into}} the game with great {{confidence}} internally but none by the wider league. They showed {{what it meant to}} be Vikings on that day player all phases and pushing the Undefeated Champions, who won the Bowl by a huge margin against the Dublin Rebels, to their limits. It was not enough and in the end a 22-man squad could not last against the huge numbers and freshness of the Belfast Trojans team. Many players felt it was one of the gutsiest Vikings performances in recent years but just not good enough. Excellent young players like Sean Goldrick, Ian Cahill, Paul Keane, Shane Gleeson and Eoin Whelan matured on the field and bode well for the Future of the team. Overall, the Vikings learned the hard way that you can't win if you don't score no matter how good your Defence is as <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> their entire season and many seasons past. The future is bright for this new generation of Vikings and keep a close eye on 2014 which is sure to be a huge one for this team.|$|E
25|$|The Criminal Law Amendment Act 1935 {{prohibited}} contraception {{and required}} sex crimes cases {{to be tried}} in camera, preventing media coverage and contributing to the illusion of Irish purity. In the 1950s there was much public attention around the plight of Irish women working as prostitutes in England. These were portrayed {{not so much as}} 'fallen' women, but rather as innocents lured into evil. The Women’s Liberation Movement of the 1970s helped to expose the double standards. Notable <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> June Levine who collaborated with Lyn Madden, a former Dublin sex worker for twenty years in the 70s and 80s, to write Lyn: A Story of Prostitution (1987) Madden had seen her lover and pimp John Cullen firebomb the home of former sex worker and women's rights activist Dolores Lynch. Lynch perished in the fire together with her elderly mother and aunt. Madden denounced Culen and began writing the book during the ensuing trial, at which Cullen received eighteen years imprisonment. At around this time a group of street sex workers brought a successful supreme court challenge to the constitutionality of Victorian laws that required a defendant to first be identified as a common prostitute through the citing of previous convictions before conviction was possible. This successful challenge created a situation of effective decriminalisation, that also offered the women the same access to the protection of the law as anyone else. During this period prostitutes were largely independent and had a good relationship with the Gardaí. Pimping was almost unheard of, as were the other crimes previously associated with prostitution. Any suggestion of organised prostitution was limited to a small number of massage parlours in an environment where the workers were empowered to negotiate favourable terms and conditions for themselves. Also improving economic conditions and a weakening force of the Church allowed for a more visible and largely tolerated sex industry.|$|E
25|$|This {{game was}} part of a double header at the Garda RFC Westmanstown. The Vikings {{entering}} the game as huge underdogs {{for the first time in}} many years. Making matters worse the Vikings lost starting QB Marc Ashworth and Starting RB Ryan Meches to unforeseen circumstances leaving them with a 22-man squad facing the Champions. The game started positively for the Vikings on offence gathering some first downs and field position. The Defence which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> the day matched the champions in every aspect and looked a better outfit than the one that lost to Belfast in the Shamrock bowl the year before. As the first half came to a close the score was a measly 0–0 with both teams showing why they have been dominant in Irish football in recent years. The Vikings cam out in the second half hoping to get some movement on offence with their Defence continuing to be Dominant and impressive. The Vikings turned to players like ever present Kieran Coen to play both sides of the ball and he was the best player on the field on the day. With many other players such as Ian Cahill, Craig Switzer, Michael Guinane, Kieran Coen, Adrian Garvey and Sean Goldrick playing Offence, Defence and Special teams the game started to wear on the Vikings. 0-0 entering the 4th quarter in unprecedented 28 degree heat there was an air of inevitability about the game with the Vikings continually running 3 and outs on offence something had to give. With less than 10 minutes left and the Trojans creeping into Viking territory there was a sense that a big play needed to be made on Defence if they were going to have a shot of knocking off the Trojans. That chance came with a well read pass from the Trojans QB by Craig Switzer. The ball in his hands with 60 yards of clear field in front of the speedster nickel star of the Vikings and he took his eye off the ball and it fell on the turf. The crowd, the team and everyone else knew that was the chance and sure enough 3 plays later the Trojans constant Barrage finally broke the Vikings Defensive wall and ran in for a 20-yard score with 7 minutes left. The Trojans stopped the Vikings offense after some gutsy first downs by QB Paul Keane, RB/DL Ian Cahill and WR Sean Goldrick. The Trojans played the clock down to minutes left and with the game getting away from them the Vikings Defence gave up another score leaving it 14–0 final score.|$|E

It touches {{on the idea that}} nothing is quite as it seems, especially the idea of being a Hollywood movie star. The second and third times I saw it, I thought it dealt with identity. Do we know who we are? And then I kept seeing different things in it... There's no right or wrong to what someone takes away from it or what they think the film is really about. It's a movie that makes you continuously ponder, makes you ask questions. I've heard over and over, 'This is a movie that I'll see again' or 'This is a movie you've got to see again.' It intrigues you. You want to get it, but I don't think it's a movie to be gotten. It's achieved its goal if it makes you ask questions." ...|$|E
500|$|Eno {{has also}} said the album is about [...] "paint {{a picture of the}} human trying to survive in an {{increasingly}} digital world" [...] and Byrne considered his job as lyricist to [...] "bring more humanity" [...] to Eno's instrumentals, which can be [...] "cold and academic." [...] Themes of humanity struggling with technology are apparent on several tracks and Byrne has characterized the [...] "overall vibe" [...] of the album as [...] "We're going to get through this. Humanity will prevail." [...] The lyrical content includes [...] "a sinister inflection" [...] but [...] "many songs feel fairly uplifting and the overall tone is hopeful." [...] Byrne focused on mundane events and attempted to write in a style that was [...] "simple but not corny, basic but heartfelt." [...] His inspiration in writing lyrics for [...] "OneFineDay" [...] <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> ValentinoAchakDeng as told in DaveEggers' —the two are thanked in the liner notes and Byrne had previously performed at a fundraiser for Eggers' 826Valencia. The story of the LostBoys of Sudan is emblematic of the spiritual themes of the album as they go through [...] "all kinds of unrelenting horrors, but [...] eternally hopeful and even cheerful, in a way that defies all logic." [...] The music on this album also expresses homesickness—a lyrical trend that is apparent in Byrne's work with TalkingHeads.|$|E
500|$|Kripke instead {{favored the}} [...] "unique and {{structurally}} interesting" [...] self-enclosed episodes, which sometimes {{arose from the}} writers' unused ideas. From the series' beginning, Kripke desired to feature an evil clown because he felt that [...] "clowns in a context where they're {{not supposed to be}} are friggin' terrifying". To fit with the series, the clown became a shapeshifting Rakshasa of Hindu mythology. This decision made the clown [...] "less satisfying", to Kripke's chagrin, because it limited the clown-related scenes. Another element of folklore favored by Kripke <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> Robert Johnson, which he focused on in his first screenplay as a writer. He found the legend similar to Supernatural, noting, [...] "It's a piece of real life American history and folklore, it's an American horror story, it takes place on the dusty back roads of rural America, and it's got great music." [...] However, the lore takes place in the early 20th century, and prevented the inclusion of Sam and Dean. To circumvent this, writer Sera Gamble suggested Johnson's story be made into a subplot detailed in flashbacks, with the Crossroads Demon returning in the present to make more deals. Although Gamble envisioned the demon's hellhound as being similar in appearance to a Rottweiler, Kripke felt it would [...] "look stupid". The creature was instead made invisible, which Gamble believes gave it a more terrifying presence.|$|E
