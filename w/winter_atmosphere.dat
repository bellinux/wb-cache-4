Based on the obtained lead detections, we compute quasi-daily pan-Arctic lead maps for the months of January to April, 2003 - 2015. Our results highlight the marginal ice zone in the Fram Strait and Barents Sea as the primary region for lead activity.

40|$|Aerosols {{with large}} particles, such as dust or sea salt, can exert {{significant}} amounts of direct infrared (IR) forcing at the surface. For example, recent observations from Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE) -Asia indicate that the aerosol IR forcing at the surface can be a few Wm- 2 up to almost 10 Wm- 2 (Vogelmann et al. 2003, Markowicz et al. 2003). Further investigation indicates that the IR forcing pattern tends to correlate with the surface concentrations of submicron Ca ++, which {{may serve as a}} dust indicator. Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) observations of aerosol concentrations at Barrow indicate that submicron Ca ++ as well as Cl- concentrations can be large. This suggests that it may be possible that dust and sea salt exact a significant IR forcing at the North Slope of Alaska (NSA) site. We investigated this possibility using atmospheric emitted radiance interferometer (AERI) observations and Line-by-Line Radiative Transfer Model (LBLRTM) calculations.

40|$|An {{influence}} of solar irradiance variations on Earth’s surface climate has been repeatedly suggested, based on correlations between solar variability and meteorological variables 1. Specifically, weaker westerly winds {{have been observed}} in winters with a less active sun, for example at the minimum phase of the 11 -year sunspot cycle 2, 3, 4. With some possible exceptions 5, 6, it has proved difficult for climate models to consistently reproduce this signal 7, 8. Spectral Irradiance Monitor satellite measurements indicate that variations in solar ultraviolet irradiance may be larger than previously thought 9. Here we drive an ocean–atmosphere climate model with ultraviolet irradiance variations based on these observations. We find that the model responds to the solar minimum with patterns in surface pressure and temperature that resemble the negative phase of the North Atlantic or Arctic Oscillation, of similar magnitude to observations. In our model, the anomalies descend through {{the depth of the}} extratropical <b>winter</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> If the updated measurements of solar ultraviolet irradiance are correct, low solar activity, as observed during recent years, drives cold winters in northern Europe and the United States, and mild winters over southern Europe and Canada, with little direct change in globally averaged temperature.

Furthermore, the dataset is used for an extensive comparison to the recent satellite instruments MLS on Aura, ACE-FTS, and MIPAS on Envisat. The vmr profiles are retrieved using the optimal estimation approach. A {{detailed analysis of the}} averaging kernel functions is carried out, showing sensitivity of the measurements between 40 and 80 km altitude, a vertical resolution of 16 to 22 km, as well as a residual influence of the region up to 130 km altitude. An error assessment reveals a total error of the retrieved profile that increases with altitude and is approx. &plusmn; 0. 1 ppmv at 50 km altitude and &plusmn; 3 ppmv at 80 km altitude. The main contributions to this total error arise from the measurement noise and the uncertainty of the used temperature profiles. The expected dynamical features of the polar <b>winter</b> middle <b>atmosphere</b> are qualitatively identified in the retrieved time series, but are not quantitatively analyzed here. The dense MLS dataset is used to investigate the influence of the collocation criteria on the satellite comparison, showing that relaxing the distance criterion causes a high bias for MLS. The comparison including the other instruments is difficult because of the small number of coincidences. However, it suggests that there is a general agreement between KIMRA and the satellite instruments below 65 km altitude, but a high bias for KIMRA above this altitude.

It was tested using simulated and actual measurements from the Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) satellite instruments. Ground truth was provided by the G-band vapour radiometer (GVR) at Barrow, Alaska. For water vapour columns less than 6  kg m − 2, comparisons between the retrieval and GVR result in a root mean square (RMS) deviation of 0. 39  kg m − 2 and a systematic bias of 0. 08  kg m − 2. These results are compared with RMS deviations and biases at Barrow for the retrieval of Melsheimer and Heygster (2008), the AIRS and MIRS satellite data products, and the ERA-Interim, NCEP, JRA- 55, and ASR reanalyses. When applied to MHS measurements, the new retrieval produces a smaller RMS deviation and bias than for the earlier retrieval and satellite data products. The RMS deviations for the new retrieval were comparable to those for the ERA-Interim, JRA- 55, and ASR reanalyses; however, the MHS retrievals have much finer horizontal resolution (15  km at nadir) and reveal more structure. The new retrieval can be used to obtain pan-Arctic maps of water vapour columns of unprecedented quality. It may also be applied to measurements from the Special Sensor Microwave/Temperature 2 (SSM/T 2), Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit B (AMSU-B), Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS), Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS), and Chinese MicroWave Humidity Sounder (MWHS) instruments...|$|E
40|$|Mariner 9 and Viking {{spacecraft}} observations {{provided evidence}} for planetary-scale, wavelike disturbances in the Mars <b>winter</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> Possible {{sources of the}} wave activity are dynamical instabilities, for example, barotropic and / or baroclinic instabilities. Other candidate sources are forced. quasi-stationary planetary waves—waves that arise predominantly via zonally asymmetric surface properties. The authors attempt to model aspects of the wave activity, focusing on forced planetary waves in representative wintertime atmospheres for Mars, by applying a spherical linear primitive equations model. Basic states representing relatively “nondusty” and “highly dusty” conditions near winter solstice allow wavenumber 1 and 2 disturbances to propagate meridionally and vertically about the jet. Higher wavenumbers are strongly vertically trapped. Stationary waves during winter in {{the northern and southern}} extratropics differ strongly in amplitude, phase, and dominant horizontal wave pattern. Northern extratropical eddies exhibit a definite wavenumber 2 pattern with comparable amplitudes for wavenumbers 1 and 2. Southern eddies, however, are very strongly dominated by wavenumber 1. Because of enhanced refractive properties of the dusty basic state, dusty responses are an order of magnitude larger than nondusty ones. Horizontal and meridional wave propagation is illuminated by diagnostics for the wave activity flux, for example, Eliassen–Palm and Plumb fluxes. As a result of the separation distance between major orographic features on Mars, together with a planetary waveguide that enhances zonal propagation, Rossby wave interferences between western and eastern hemispheric wave trains occur. This analysis is relevant to future global mapping missions to Mars (e. g., polar-orbiting space craft) that will return key atmospheric observations of planetary wave activity...|$|E

The increase measured above the southern polar region has permitted calculation {{of the increase in}} mixing ratio of Ar from L(sub s) 8 to 100 between latitudes 75 S and 90 S. The peak in Ar enhancement occurs about 200 Earth days after CO 2 freeze-out has begun, indicating that up to this time equatorward meridional mixing is rapid enough to move enhanced Ar from the polar regions northward. Although the CO 2 frost depth continues to increase from L(sub s) 110 deg to 190 deg, the Ar enhancement steadily decreases to its baseline value reached at about L(sub s) 200 deg. Our data permit an estimate of the horizontal eddy mixing coefficient useful for constraining equatorward meridional mixing during southern winter and a characteristic mixing time for the polar southern <b>winter</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> Also, using the drop in excess Ar measured by the GRS from L(sub s) 110 deg to 200 deg, we estimate an eddy coefficient appropriate for meridional mixing of the entire Ar excess back to the baseline value. The horizontal eddy mixing coefficients are derived using Ar as a tracer much as the vertical eddy mixing coefficient for the Earth's troposphere is derived using CH 4 as a minor constituent tracer. The estimation of meridional mixing for high latitudes at Mars is important for constraining parameters used in atmospheric modeling and predicting seasonal and daily behavior.

The presence of idealized Great Lakes, as opposed to land, results in a phase shift in the annual cycle of latent and sensible heat flux. Very high upward sensible heat flux occurs over these idealized Great Lakes during the early winter. On the average over a region encompassing these idealized Great Lakes, evaporation and precipitation increase during the autumn and winter and decrease during the late spring and summer due to the lakes. Annual average water vapor flux convergence increases. The Great Lakes also alter the meridional air temperature gradient. During the autumn and winter, the me-ridional temperature gradient is intensified {{to the north of the}} Great Lakes and diminished to the south. This intensifies the mean jet stream core and displaces it toward the north. This effect is reduced during the winter compared to the autumn because air temperature changes due to the lakes are unable to penetrate as deeply into the strongly stably stratified <b>winter</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> The increase in jet stream speed seems to increase synoptic wave activity to the northeast of the Great Lakes. As an additional experimental case, a swamp surface (saturated surface with no thermal capacity) is used to represent the Great Lakes.

Winter nights average 6.9 °C (44.4 °F), although an average of 2.1 nights per year see temperatures fall below 2 °C (36 °F), mostly in July, and an average of only 0.2 nights per year fall below 0 °C (32 °F). These low temperatures often occur when the night sky is clear and the ground can radiate heat back into the <b>atmosphere.</b> <b>Winter</b> nights, though, are typically a few degrees cooler and frost is not uncommon in some areas.|$|R
40|$|This study compares CO in the Arctic {{stratosphere}} and mesosphere {{measured by}} ground-based microwave radiometry with simulations {{made with the}} Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model driven with specified dynamical fields (SD-WACCM 4) for the Arctic winters 2008 / 2009 and 2009 / 2010. CO is a tracer for polar <b>winter</b> middle <b>atmosphere</b> dynamics, hence the representation of polar dynamics in the model is examined indirectly. Measurements were taken with the Kiruna Microwave Radiometer (KIMRA). The instrument, which is located in Kiruna, Northern Sweden (67. 8 &deg; N, 20. 4 &deg; E), provides CO profiles between 40 and 80 km altitude. The present comparison, {{which is one of}} the first between SD-WACCM 4 and measurements, is performed on the smallest space and time scales currently simulated by the model; the global model is evaluated daily at the particular model grid-point closest to Kiruna. As a guide to what can generally be expected from such a comparison, the same analysis is repeated for observations of CO from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), a microwave radiometer onboard NASA's Aura satellite, which has global coverage. First, time-mean profiles of CO are compared, revealing that the profile shape of KIMRA deviates from SD-WACCM 4 and MLS, especially in the upper mesosphere. SD-WACCM 4 and MLS are mostly consistent throughout the range of altitude considered; however, SD-WACCM 4 shows slightly lower values above 60 km and this discrepancy increases with altitude. Second, the time evolution is compared for the complete time series, as well as for the slowly and rapidly evolving parts alone. Overall, the agreement among the datasets is very good and the model is almost as consistent with the measurements as the measurements are with each other. Mutual correlation coefficients of the slowly varying part of the CO time series are &ge; 0. 9 over a wide altitude range. This demonstrates that the polar <b>winter</b> middle <b>atmosphere</b> dynamics is very well represented in SD-WACCM 4 and that the relaxation to analyzed meteorological fields below 50 km constrains the behavior of the simulation sufficiently, even at higher altitudes, such that the simulation above 50 km is close to the measurements. However, above 50 km, the model-measurement correlation for the rapidly varying part of the CO time series is lower (0. 3) than the measurement-measurement correlation (0. 6). This is attributed to the fact that the gravity wave parametrization in WACCM is based on a generic gravity wave spectrum and cannot be expected to capture the instantaneous behavior of the actual gravity wave field present in the atmosphere...|$|R
