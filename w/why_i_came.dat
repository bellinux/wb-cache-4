500|$|Mikel {{believed}} his sending off was [...] "harsh" [...] {{and placed the}} blame on the Arsenal players, who he felt overreacted. Lampard described his teammate Drogba as “…special, he's {{the best in the}} world at the moment. He does it week in, week out and on the big occasions." [...] He argued the brawl near the end of the match highlighted how much the players from both sides wanted to win. Defender Ashley Cole, who left Arsenal in acrimonious terms to join Chelsea felt his decision to move was vindicated: [...] "I'm enjoying life, the manager's good and after six or seven months here I've already won a medal. That's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> here." [...] Journalist Ian McGarry reported that Abramovich chose not to join the Chelsea players in congratulating them on their cup win, noting the fractured relationship between him and Mourinho.|$|E
500|$|Liverpool's victory {{meant they}} won the trophy for the eighth time, {{extending}} their record number of victories in the competition. Midfielder Stewart Downing was awarded the Alan Hardaker Trophy as {{the man of the}} match. Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish was delighted to have won the League Cup and was adamant that the club would continue to win trophies: [...] "Although we have won something today, that is not us finished, we don't want to stop here. We want to keep going. We've won it {{and we are going to}} really enjoy it. I know how much the players have enjoyed it and it gives you a wee flavour to come back and do it again." [...] The victory meant that Dalglish became the seventh manager to win all three major domestic trophies in English football. Goalscorer Dirk Kuyt was equally delighted to have won the competition: [...] "We wanted this so desperately, this is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> to Anfield. To get my first medal is great." [...] Meanwhile, captain Steven Gerrard had mixed emotions, due to his cousin Anthony Gerrard missing the deciding penalty: [...] "One of Anthony or I was going to be sad, one was going to be celebrating. It happens. I've got mixed emotions at the moment because I feel for Anthony and Cardiff." ...|$|E
500|$|The cover artwork {{features}} {{porn star}} Janine Lindemulder {{dressed in a}} nurse uniform, pulling on a rubber glove. The band—semi-nude—appear on the back cover with Lindemulder preparing {{for some sort of}} injection. The trio was oblivious to the fact that Lindemulder worked in the porn industry until informed by producer Jerry Finn. The record company had delivered a stack of photos of potential cover girls, and the band members happened to pick Lindemulder. [...] "So it's kind of funny that they've been lumped in with Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit, who play up that kind of pimp lifestyle, because Blink is so not that," [...] remarked Finn. According to Mark Hoppus, they always intended to have a sexy nurse on the cover, and the women considered included [...] models from both Playboy and Janine's employer Vivid Entertainment. David Goldman was the photographer behind the shoot, held March 12, 1999, and did not know the trio before shooting. In 2012, he stated the glove was inspired by the album's working title. [...] "Up until the very last minute, the album was going to be called Turn Your Head and Cough," [...] he said. [...] "And that's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> {{up with the idea of}} the glove. Obviously an enema is not really a glove type of thing. I thought it was a good visual." [...] Lindemulder is also featured in the music videos for [...] "What's My Age Again?" [...] and [...] "Man Overboard".|$|E

2500|$|We'd {{decided to}} write a Christmas song and I {{wanted to make it}} reflect a British family Christmas. Economically, the country was up the creek.

2500|$|In July 2005, after a 10-year {{absence from}} The Young and the Restless, it was {{announced}} that Brown was to reprise the role. At the time, Brown had been appearing on ABC's One Life to Live as Paige Miller, and Brown reportedly opted to leave the role when ABC was unable to match the financial terms of a contract offered to her by CBS. She returned on August 5, 2005, and her run ended on January 11, 2006. However, that December, the character returned, though not portrayed by Brown, but by Michelle Stafford, who in addition portrayed Phyllis Summers. For the reason of Brown not returning to the role, the actress said: [...] "I had a bad accident last year, and when they wanted me back in November, I really couldn't go at that time, and that's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> back looking like somebody else." [...] Stafford only portrayed the role for two months until February 9, 2007, when Sheila was shot by her longtime enemy Lauren Fenmore and presumed dead.|$|E
2500|$|By the {{following}} morning, both men reasoned {{that they would}} have to leave NBC, and O'Brien opened that night's show with [...] "We’ve got a great show for you tonight—I have no idea when it will air, but it's gonna be a great show." [...] Polone viewed the move, as a whole, a reactionary one by Zucker, concluding that he was acting in self-preservation, since NBCUniversal owner General Electric (GE) was in the process of negotiating the sale of a controlling interest in the company to cable operator Comcast. When a story ran that night on The New York Times website that Fox had an [...] "overt interest" [...] in O'Brien and was not going along with the plan, Zucker reasoned that Polone was to blame. The situation became heated when Zucker placed a call to O'Brien's agent, Rick Rosen, inquiring on the story and demanding an immediate answer from the O'Brien camp regarding the changes. Gaspin spoke on the situation at a previously scheduled press conference that Sunday, noting that [...] "I obviously couldn’t satisfy either with 100 percent of what they wanted. That’s <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> up with this compromise." [...] Zucker, upon hearing that O'Brien still did not take the proposal well, threatened Rosen: [...] "I'm going to tell you right now that I can pay him or play him. I can ice you guys." [...] On Monday night's show, O'Brien continued jokes on the subject; responding to thunderous applause, he joked, [...] "You keep that up, and this monologue won’t start until 12:05." ...|$|E
