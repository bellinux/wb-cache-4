5|$|At its root, {{the peasant}} war of 1653 <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> rapidly {{changing}} economic circumstances {{after the end}} of the Thirty Years' War. The Swiss Confederacy had been spared from all belligerent action; the Swiss peasants generally had profited from the wartime economy as they had been able to export their agrarian products at higher prices than before. After the Peace of Westphalia, the southern German economy recovered quickly, the Swiss exports dwindled, and the prices for agrarian products dropped. Many Swiss peasants, who had raised mortgages during the boom at wartime, suddenly faced financial problems.|$|E

The 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion, which killed 14 people and injured 40, and destroyed most of the refinery, <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ignition of sugar dust. In its culinary use, sugar that is exposed to a heat source causes caramelization to take place. As the process occurs, volatile chemicals such as diacetyl are released, producing the characteristic caramel flavor.|$|E
5|$|Feynman {{played an}} {{important}} role on the Presidential Rogers Commission, which investigated the Challenger disaster. During a televised hearing, Feynman demonstrated that the material used in the shuttle's O-rings became less resilient in cold weather by compressing a sample of the material in a clamp and immersing it in ice-cold water. The commission ultimately determined that the disaster <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> primary O-ring not properly sealing in unusually cold weather at Cape Canaveral.|$|E

In 1905, Albert Einstein theorized that this Brownian motion <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> water molecules continuously knocking the grains about, and developed a hypothetical mathematical model to describe it. This model was validated experimentally in 1908 by French physicist Jean Perrin, thus providing additional validation for particle theory (and by extension atomic theory).|$|E

5|$|The Palace of Westminster, {{the medieval}} royal palace {{used as the}} home of the British parliament, was largely {{destroyed}} by fire on 16 October 1834. The blaze <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> burning of small wooden tally sticks which had been used as part of the accounting procedures of the Exchequer until 1826. The sticks were disposed of in a careless manner in the two furnaces under the House of Lords, which caused a chimney fire in the two flues that ran under the floor of the Lords' chamber and up through the walls.|$|E

The official censuses showed 134,000 residents in 1977 and 393,325 in 1988, although both figures were probably smaller than reality. The population is now estimated to consist of at least one third of the country's population of 3.2 million and the 2013 census showed a population of 958,399.|$|E

5|$|The first Ancient Hawaiians {{to arrive}} on Hawaii island lived along the shores where {{food and water}} were plentiful. Flightless birds that had {{previously}} known no predators became a staple food source. Early settlements had {{a major impact on}} the local ecosystem, and caused many extinctions, particularly amongst bird species, as well as introducing foreign plants and animals and increasing erosion rates. The prevailing lowland forest ecosystem was transformed from forest to grassland; some of this change <b>was</b> <b>caused</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> use of fire, but the main reason appears to have been the introduction of the Polynesian Rat (Rattus exulans).|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{maintained its}} intensity and passed northwest of Bermuda on September 9, where winds reached 70 mph (110 km/h) and air pressures fell to 988 mbar (hPa; 29.18 inHg). The storm continued to weaken, eventually becoming a Category 2 hurricane on September 11; at this time, the Koenigin Luise measured an air pressure of 950 mbar (hPa; 28.06 inHg). The system became extratropical later during the day, and lost its identity on September 12 in the North Atlantic near the British Isles.

5|$|With the {{development}} of the particle accelerator {{during the first half of}} the twentieth century, physicists began to delve deeper into the properties of subatomic particles. The first successful attempt to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction was made in 1942 by Donald Kerst. His initial betatron reached energies of 2.3MeV, while subsequent betatrons achieved 300MeV. In 1947, synchrotron radiation was discovered with a 70MeV electron synchrotron at General Electric.
