30|$|The {{structural}} {{starting point}} of the economic transformation was an oversized state-owned industry characterized by low competition and weak interaction with the world market. Despite still being the majority owner, the state intervention had been limited to periodic <b>wage</b> <b>indexations</b> only for state institutions to diminish the increasing gap caused by more rapid wage increases in some industries because of the negotiations of collective and individual contracts. The wage setting, supplemented by price liberalization and privatization {{and a lack of}} (the enforcement of) laws had an effect on labor market participation (Earle and Sapatoru 1993), occupational attainment and, nonetheless, on people’s opinion about their opportunities and their place on the labor market. On the 2000 Gender Barometer, about half of the interviewees answered that real equality of rights between men and women does not exist. 3 The majority (75 - 88 %) considered gender not to be important in some occupations with respect to whom should be employed (e.g., media, nongovernmental organizations, public administration, health, agriculture and banking) but that men should be employed in mining and metallurgy and construction, and women should be employed in the textile industry.|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The paper aims at {{developing}} a theoretical model for de facto dollarized small open economies focusing on currency substitution and nominal <b>wages</b> <b>indexation</b> to the exchange rate. Design/methodology/approach - The analysis is {{performed in a}} general equilibrium "New Open Economy Macroeconomics" framework with nominal rigidities and imperfect competition in the nontraded good sector. Findings - The paper finds that a dollar-indexed economy with low degrees of payments/financial dollarization could experience higher costs in terms of exchange rate and output fluctuations when nominal shocks dominate real shocks, making stabilization programs more difficult to achieve in a rapid and less costly way. Practical implications - The speed of adjustment of macro variables is faster in the highly dollarized economy as a response. A higher level of financial dollarization increases the frequency of domestic prices and wages revisions to nominal exchange rate shocks. This might explain, in turn, why nominal disturbances are shorter lived in the higher dollarized economies, and the asymmetry between financial and real dollarization Originality/value - Contrary to the "conventional wisdom" that predicts {{a positive relationship between}} the degrees of dollarization and the exchange rate pass-through, our model shows that the degree of dollarization and the degree of dollar indexation are not necessarily the same or even correlated.

Because it takes more than one year to fully collect such data, and because some people have January birthdays, the age 62 calculation done in 2006 must be based on the most recent data which is the 2004 national average wage.

The analysis assumes {{that both the}} demand for the labor services of minimum-wage workers and {{the setting of the}} nominal minimum wage rate under existing policy depend in part on rational expectations of future average wage rates. The analysis implies that, if the indexation ratio of the nominal minimum wage to the recent-past average wage rate were large relative both to the level and trend of the expected rate of average wage inflation and to the existing relative minimum-wage target, indexation would decrease the average level over time of minimum-wage employment. The analysis also implies that, if the year-to-year variation in expected wage inflation were large relative to the year-to-year variation in unexpected <b>wage</b> inflation, <b>indexation</b> would increase the year-to-year variation in minimum-wage employment. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{some economic}} {{problems faced by}} the Eastern European nations {{in light of recent}} Latin American experiences. The paper first argues that in spite of some important cultural, political and institutional differences, there are indeed some similarities between Eastern European and Latin American economic problems. The discussion concentrates on four specific areas: (1) monetary overhang and repressed inflation; (2) fiscal imbalances and inflationary pressures; (3) deindexation and inflationary inertia; and (4) the use of the exchange rate as a nominal anchor. It is argued that in Chile the reliance on a price jump to solve the money overhang problem of 1973 created high inflationary expectations, increasing the degree of inertia of inflation. It is also pointed out that the Latin American experience tells a serious cautionary tale regarding the use of nominal exchange rate anchors. More often than not these types of policies have resulted in overvaluation, losses in international competitiveness and eventual external sector crises. A comparison of the Chilean and Mexican stabilization programs suggest that the use of exchange rate anchors will be more effective (and more credible) if the fixing of the exchange rate is accompanied by other policies geared at breaking inertia. Among these policies the most important one is the abandonment of <b>wage</b> rate <b>indexation</b> practices. ...|$|R
