5|$|Disraeli's {{political}} views embraced certain Radical policies, particularly democratic {{reform of the}} electoral system, and also some Tory ones, including protectionism.

5|$|In May 1762, the {{incumbent}} Whig {{government of the}} Duke of Newcastle was replaced with one led by the Scottish Tory Lord Bute.

John Wilkes, a Member of Parliament, published The North Briton, which was both inflammatory and defamatory in its condemnation of Bute and the government. Wilkes was eventually arrested for seditious libel but he fled to France to escape punishment; he was expelled from the House of Commons, and found guilty in absentia of blasphemy and libel. In 1763, after concluding the Peace of Paris which ended the war, Lord Bute resigned, allowing the Whigs under George Grenville to return to power.|$|E

The next year, they went one better, beating Liverpool in the final to claim his first and only trophy at Old Trafford.

5|$|James had a {{controversial}} religious policy; {{his attempt to}} grant freedom of religion to non-Anglicans by suspending acts of Parliament by royal decree was not well received.

In an attempt to damage William, James encouraged his daughter's staff to inform her that William <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>an</b> <b>affair</b> <b>with</b> Elizabeth Villiers. Acting on the information, Mary waited outside Villiers's room and caught her husband leaving it late at night. William denied adultery, and Mary apparently believed and forgave him. Possibly, Villiers and William were not meeting as lovers but to exchange diplomatic intelligence. Mary's staff was dismissed and sent back to Britain.|$|E
