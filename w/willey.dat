5|$|In 1960, Banks hit a {{major league}} and NL-leading 41 HR, had 117 RBI, and led the NL in games played for the sixth time in seven years. He {{was also the first}} Cubs player to receive an annual NL Gold Glove award (for shortstop). On the eve of the 1960 World Series, Joe Reichler, a writer for the Associated Press, {{reported}} that the Milwaukee Braves were prepared to pay cash and trade pitchers Joey Jay, Carlton <b>Willey</b> and Don Nottebart, outfielder Billy Bruton, shortstop Johnny Logan and first baseman Frank Torre in exchange for Banks from the Cubs.|$|E
5|$|People {{identifying}} with Asperger syndrome may refer to themselves in casual conversation as aspies (a term first used in print by Liane Holliday <b>Willey</b> in 1999). The word neurotypical (abbreviated NT) describes a person whose neurological development and state are typical, {{and is often}} used to refer to non-autistic people. The Internet has allowed individuals with AS {{to communicate with each other}} in a way that was not previously possible because of their rarity and geographic dispersal, forming a subculture composed of people with Asperger's. Internet sites like Wrong Planet have made it easier for individuals to connect.|$|E

5|$|The Dodgers re-tied {{the game}} the next inning, however. Neal singled with one out and Wally Moon {{grounded}} into a force out at second base. Moon then advanced to second on a Larker single and scored on a Gil Hodges single to make the score 2–2. Don Demeter hit a single, the third consecutive and fourth of the inning, to load the bases but John Roseboro flew out to end the inning without further scoring. Sherry held the Braves scoreless {{in the bottom of}} the third, opening the inning with a walk but then inducing a double play and a foul out to quickly close it. Sherry and <b>Willey</b> traded scoreless innings in the fourth and fifth although the Braves threatened against Sherry in both innings, allowing two base-runners each time but escaping with no runs. Roseboro led off the top of the sixth inning with a home run to give the Dodgers a 3–2 lead. Roseboro had also hit a home run the day before against the Chicago Cubs, a game the Dodgers won to force the tie-breaker. <b>Willey</b> put out the next three batters to quickly end the inning, but the damage had been done.|$|E
5|$|Northamptonshire {{entered the}} {{competition}} in the second round, {{in which they were}} drawn against Surrey County Cricket Club. They won the match by six wickets, aided by a century from Geoff Cook which earned him the man of the match award. In the quarter-finals, they beat Leicestershire by eight wickets, with particularly economical bowling from Sarfraz Nawaz and Richard Williams helping to limit their opponents to 180, a total which Northamptonshire reached with 4.2 overs to spare. Northamptonshire batted first during their semi-final against Sussex, a match which they won by 37 runs. Allan Lamb and Peter <b>Willey</b> shared a partnership of 157 for the fourth wicket, and Willey's economical bowling was then instrumental in restricting Sussex to 218, for which he was named man of the match.|$|E
5|$|Chicago White Sox manager Al López {{watched the}} game {{along with his}} {{pitching}} coach to scout their potential NL opponents for the World Series. The start of Game 1 was delayed 45 minutes due to rain, leaving only 18,297 fans in the stadium once the game was underway. The Dodgers opened the game quickly as Charlie Neal singled with one out, advanced to second base on a ground out, and scored on a single by Norm Larker to give the Dodgers an early 1–0 lead. Dodgers starter Danny McDevitt held the Braves scoreless in the first inning, but was driven from {{the game in the}} second. After a line out to open the inning Johnny Logan walked, Del Crandall singled, and Bill Bruton singled to bring home Logan and tie the game at 1. Larry Sherry entered in relief of McDevitt, who pitched just 1 innings. Carl <b>Willey,</b> the Braves' pitcher, reached base on an error to load the bases. Crandall then scored on a ground out by Bobby Ávila to give the Braves a 2–1 lead before Sherry finished out the second.|$|E

He is of Italian descent from paternal side. He {{grew up on a}} small family farm in <b>Willey</b> Station, Illinois, and near Taylorville. After completing high school at Taylorville High School, where he had been the football quarterback and basketball captain, he attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where {{he was a member of}} the Phi Delta Theta fraternity, and graduated in 1969, earning Phi Beta Kappa honors. While in college, he enlisted in the United States Marine Corps Reserve and served from 1969 until 1975, attaining the rank of sergeant. In 1970 he enrolled in the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, from which he received a Master of Business Administration degree in 1973.|$|E
5|$|On August 27, as Columbus {{hosted the}} Havana Sugar Kings, Roberts became only the fifth player in International League history to hit four {{home runs in}} a game (and the first since Newark's Bob Seeds in 1938). It {{was also the first}} 4-home-run game in {{franchise}} history, as well as the first time a player on any team had performed the feat in Columbus. Roberts had struck only four home runs in 69 previous games with the Jets. Prior to the 1957 season, Roberts was traded to the New York Yankees as the player to be named later in a trade that sent former American League Most Valuable Player Bobby Shantz to the Yankees. In 1957 Roberts played with the New York Yankees minor league affiliate in Denver. At the end of the season, Roberts received several votes in the final tally for Most Valuable Player of the American Association, finishing behind Carl <b>Willey</b> of the Wichita Braves. Roberts never again reached the Majors, becoming a journeyman in the minor leagues and at one point played baseball in Nicaragua.|$|E
5|$|The Convention met from February 3 – December 6, 1861, {{and elected}} John Janney its {{presiding}} officer. The majority at first voted {{to remain in}} the Union, but stayed in session awaiting events. At first, the speeches were mixed between Secessionists advocating leaving the Union, Conditional Unionists holding onto the patriotism of earlier times, and Unconditional Unionists insisting that secession was bad policy and unlawful. On March 4, Abraham Lincoln’s inauguration day, Jefferson Davis called up 100,000 militia to serve a year and sent besieging troops to surround Fort Sumter in South Carolina and Fort Pickens in Florida. That same day Waitman T. <b>Willey</b> from trans-Alleghany Monongalia County answered secessionists with a Unionist speech. He defended Virginia's institutions from Northern attacks against slavery, but “there is no constitutional right of secession...” He warned that secession would bring about war, taxes and the abolition of slavery in Virginia.|$|E

5|$|Between {{the first}} and second Tests, Willis went back to Warwickshire to face Gloucestershire in a County Championship match, {{grabbing}} three wickets. He returned to face Australia on 2 July for the second Test, and England batting first. Thanks to 82 from Peter <b>Willey,</b> and a second half-century from Gatting, together with five runs from Willis, England reached 311 – though Geoff Lawson took seven wickets. Australia surpassed this and were dismissed for 345, with three wickets for Willis and three for Dilley. The England bowlers suffered from no balls, Willis alone bowling 28. England declared late in the game on 265/8, and Willis picked up another wicket as Australia reached 90/4 at the close of play. Botham, who had captained the side until then, was sacked and replaced by Brearley. Willis, who was struggling for fitness and had a chest infection, was dropped from the side. He sat out a Warwickshire county match and after speaking to Alec Bedser was given back his place in the team on the condition that he played in a 40-over match, played a Second XI game, and bowled 12 overs in the nets. He succeeded in these tasks, and was tentatively let back into the squad over a spinner.|$|E

25|$|Joan was {{the widow}} of Robert de Harley of <b>Willey</b> and had a {{daughter}} and heiress, Alice, who married Sir Hamo Peshall or Hamon Peshale. Joan brought a range of properties, acquired from her own family and her first husband, which must have greatly increased Darras's comfort and security while she was alive. She had {{a considerable amount of}} jointure property from her first marriage – in Shropshire at Harley, Gretton, <b>Willey</b> and Kenley, and in Worcestershire part of a manor at Hampton Lovett, known as Over Hall. Some of theses properties passed to Roger <b>Willey,</b> a relative of Sir Robert Harley, in 1400, presumably on Joan's death: <b>Willey</b> was a business associate of Darras. The Hampton Lovett property, however, was destined for Alice, Joan and Robert Harley's daughter, who married Sir Hamo Peshall.|$|E
