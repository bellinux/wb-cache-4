5|$|Despite {{the early}} {{indication}} of a naming error, Engelmann's binomial was {{used to describe the}} plant until 1893, when F.A. Haage Jr. changed Terscheck's Echinocactus reichenbachii to Echinocereus reichenbachii, which Nathaniel Lord Britton and Joseph Nelson Rose later adopted. This broke with the long-standing botanical tradition to use the earliest known name, but because Terscheck's description <b>was</b> <b>lacking</b> and possibly referred to as many as a dozen species, his binomial was supplanted by Haage's.|$|E
5|$|Dundee United's {{traditional}} rivals are Dundee, {{with whom}} they compete in the Dundee derby. The fixture <b>was</b> <b>lacking</b> a competitive element {{for a number of}} years until Dundee's return to the top flight of the Scottish game. A unique element of the rivalry lies in the fact that both clubs' stadiums are located within 100 yards of one another.|$|E
5|$|Super Monkey Ball {{received}} highly positive {{reviews from}} critics, who praised the simplicity and subtle depth of its control scheme {{as well as}} the new multiplayer modes not present in its arcade counterpart, although some felt its presentation <b>was</b> <b>lacking.</b> The game was commercially successful and remained one of Sega's best-sellers in the United States for much of 2002, eventually spawning a direct sequel, Super Monkey Ball 2, and an entire Super Monkey Ball franchise.|$|E

5|$|The JNA {{launched}} repeated {{assaults on}} Vukovar {{but failed to}} make any progress. Its armour, designed for combat in open country, was barely able to enter Vukovar's narrow streets. Support from regular infantry <b>was</b> <b>lacking,</b> and the TO's poorly trained and motivated troops were inadequate substitutes. The JNA's soldiers appeared to have little {{understanding of how to}} conduct urban operations and its officers displayed slow and reactive decision-making on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The breed {{is thought}} to have {{acquired}} its name by association with the area known as Pomerania which is located in northern Poland and Germany along the Baltic Sea. Although not the origin of the breed, this area is credited with the breeding which led to the original Pomeranian type of dog. Proper documentation <b>was</b> <b>lacking</b> until the breed's introduction into the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The design's lack of {{structural}} integrity {{is seen as}} another significant weakness of the Quad ESL-63 since its inception, and lived on in its various successors. Other shortcomings include very limited sound pressure levels, meaning that it won't play loud, and its bass response <b>was</b> <b>lacking.</b> In addition, one reviewer experienced problems with shut-downs playing music with high intensity bass drums.|$|E

5|$|The {{size of the}} pre-Reform {{electorate}} {{is difficult}} to estimate. Voter registration <b>was</b> <b>lacking,</b> and many boroughs were rarely contested in elections. It is estimated that immediately before the 1832 Reform Act, 400,000 English subjects were entitled to vote, and that after passage, the number rose to 650,000, an increase of more than 60%.|$|E
5|$|A {{couple of}} days before the Varsity Match, talk in the press had been of Geen's likely {{selection}} for England for the forthcoming Home Nations Championship. Geen and Poulton, who together were considered the scoring force of the Oxford team, were both selected to play for England in the second trial match against The North in Leeds. Although Geen scored a try in the game, his form <b>was</b> <b>lacking</b> and he was outshone by Poulton. So for the third and final trial, England versus The Rest on 7 January 1911, Geen was not selected.|$|E
5|$|By early July 1907 Shackleton {{had secured}} little {{financial}} support beyond Beardmore's guarantee and <b>was</b> <b>lacking</b> {{the funds to}} complete the refit of the ship. In mid-July he approached the philanthropic Earl of Iveagh, otherwise known as Edward Guinness, head of the Anglo-Irish brewing family, who agreed to guarantee the sum of £2,000 (updated value £) provided that Shackleton found other backers to contribute a further £6,000. Shackleton {{was able to do}} this, the extra funds including £2,000 from Sir Philip Brocklehurst, who paid this sum to secure a place on the expedition.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{started in}} February 1962 and cost NOK3.2 million. The runway was {{completed}} {{by the fall of}} that year, but other parts of the construction were delayed. By late April 1963, the airport <b>was</b> <b>lacking</b> fire fighting equipment and ground crew had still not received sufficient training. However, the issues were resolved, allowing the airport to open on schedule on 4 May 1963. Lakselv and Kirkenes Airport also opened the same day, while Tromsø Airport opened the following year. Several important facilities were missing from Alta Airport when it opened; the control tower and the passenger terminal were not completed until 1964, so at first a shed was used as terminal.|$|E
5|$|Cosimo became perturbed by the {{question}} of the Tuscan Succession following the death of his mother. Ferdinando <b>was</b> <b>lacking</b> any children, as was Anna Maria Luisa. The latter, who was high in her father's estimation, put forward a German princess to marry Gian Gastone. The lady in question, Anna Maria Franziska of Saxe-Lauenburg, nominal heiress of the Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg, was extremely wealthy. Cosimo once again dreamed of a Medici cadet branch in a foreign land. They were married on 2 July 1697. Gian Gastone and herself did not get along; he eventually abandoned her in 1708.|$|E
5|$|Crytek then {{pitched the}} game to {{different}} publishers, and eventually, in 2009, the company pitched the two projects to Microsoft. According to Nick Button-Brown, the general manager at Crytek, the game was not functional at that time, and only served {{to prove to the}} publisher that a first-person melee game was fun for players. The representative from Microsoft, Phil Spencer, admired Crytek's intention to expand, and thought that Microsoft's games line up for the Xbox 360 <b>was</b> <b>lacking</b> a first-person melee-combat game. As a result, they accepted to publish Kingdoms, and rejected Kings. The two companies agreed that the project would be a natural fit for Microsoft's yet-to-be-announced Kinect.|$|E

5|$|Nickell finally {{consented to}} a {{polygraph}} examination in November 1986. She failed it and investigators narrowed their focus to her even further; however, concrete evidence proving that Nickell had ever purchased or used cyanide <b>was</b> <b>lacking,</b> and despite their relative certainty that Stella Nickell had orchestrated the poisonings as either an elaborate cover-up for an insurance-motivated {{murder of her}} husband, or as {{a desperate attempt to}} force her husband's death to be ruled an accident, to increase her insurance payout, they were unable to build a strong enough case to support an arrest.|$|E
5|$|Prospective {{customers}} included ILFC, CIT Aerospace, Lufthansa, and Hapag-Lloyd. The latter two, however, were unimpressed {{with the}} long-range variant, preferring a shorter-range aircraft, which was {{better suited to}} their route structure. Singapore Airlines was also an expected customer because it {{was looking for a}} replacement for the A310. Airbus intended to freeze the design in late 2001, with the first flight scheduled for the third quarter of 2003 and entry into service within a year. The programme was later abandoned, as interest from customers <b>was</b> <b>lacking.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) {{objected to}} the {{construction}} of the Creek Turnpike in a letter dated January 30, 1990. FEMA felt that documentation on how the project would affect the floodplains in the area <b>was</b> <b>lacking,</b> preventing local authorities from requesting updates to floodplain maps, which were necessary to keep their communities enrolled in flood insurance programs. OTA's attorney stated that the requisite information had been provided to local officials, and it was not OTA's responsibility to ensure that they forwarded the information on to FEMA.|$|E

5|$|World War II was a {{demanding}} {{time for the}} railway line, as the track was in heavy use for both civilian and military transportation, {{and much of the}} equipment and maintenance <b>was</b> <b>lacking.</b> On 28 February 1944 a descending eastbound freight train loaded with oil and petrol lost its braking power and became a runaway train, finally ploughing into a westbound passenger train at Breifoss, just east of Geilo. The crash and subsequent fire killed 25 civilians and an unknown number of German soldiers. Poor lubrication oil combined with the cold weather is believed to have caused the accident.|$|E
5|$|A large {{petroleum}} reservoir {{was discovered}} {{just west of}} the city of Burkburnett, a small town in Wichita County, Texas in 1912. Burkburnett and its surrounding communities became boomtowns, experiencing explosive growth of their populations and economies. By 1918, an estimated 20,000 new settlers had taken up residence around the lucrative oil field, and many Wichita County residents became wealthy virtually overnight. As people streamed into the local communities in search of high-paying jobs, the nearby city of Wichita Falls began to grow in importance. Though it initially lacked the necessary infrastructure for this sudden increase in economic and industrial activity, Wichita Falls was a natural choice to serve as the local logistical hub, being the seat of Wichita County. Because office space <b>was</b> <b>lacking,</b> major stock transactions and mineral rights deals were conducted on street corners and in tents that served as makeshift headquarters for the new oil companies.|$|E
