5000|$|There {{are several}} {{theories}} {{as to the}} proper technique of hard-boiling an egg. One method is to bring <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil</b> and cook for ten minutes. [...] Another method is to bring the <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil,</b> but then remove the pan {{from the heat and}} allow eggs to cook in the gradually cooling water. Over-cooking eggs will typically result in a thin green iron(II) sulfide coating on the yolk. This reaction occurs more rapidly in older eggs as the whites are more alkaline.Immersing the egg in cold water after boiling is a common method of halting the cooking process to prevent this effect. It also causes a slight shrinking of the contents of the egg.|$|E

5000|$|A typical Swedish {{recipe for}} nettle soup {{involves}} first blanching the nettles, and then straining {{them from the}} liquid. The liquid is then strained again to remove the dirt (pieces of sand or gravel) from it. Then a roux is made, with butter and flour, onto which the [...] "nettle water" [...] (the water in which the nettles were blanched) is poured. The nettles are chopped very finely, or puréed, together with the other ingredients, which typically include chives (or ramson or garlic), and chervil or fennel. The chopped or puréed nettles and herbs are then put into the nettle <b>water,</b> brought <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>boil,</b> and then left <b>to</b> simmer for <b>a</b> few minutes. Some recipes call for discarding the nettle water {{and replacing it with}} chicken stock or lamb stock, but according to others this way of making the soup takes away the natural taste of the nettles. The soup is commonly served with sliced boiled eggs, and occasionally with poached eggs.Typically some broth is added as the nettles have very little taste by themselves.|$|R

500|$|Starting in the 6th century, {{the farmers}} living in central Mesa Verde {{cultivated}} corn, beans, squash, and gourds. The combination {{of corn and}} beans provided the Mesa Verdeans with the amino acids of a complete protein. When conditions were good, [...] of land would provide enough food {{for a family of}} three or four individuals for one year, providing they supplemented with game and wild plants. As Mesa Verdeans increasingly relied on corn as a dietary staple, {{the success or failure of}} crop yields factored heavily into their lives. The mesa tilts slightly to the south, which increased its exposure to the sun. Before the introduction of pottery, foods were baked, roasted, and parched. Hot rocks dropped into containers could bring <b>water</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> brief <b>boil,</b> but because beans must be <b>boiled</b> for <b>an</b> hour or more their use was not widespread until after pottery had disseminated throughout the region. With the increased availability of ceramics after 600, beans became much easier to cook. This provided a high quality protein that reduced reliance on hunting. It also aided corn cultivation, as legumes add much needed nutrients to soils they are grown in, which likely increased corn yields.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{effects of}} three cooking methods on the chemical, physical, and sensory prop-erties of hard-cooked eggs were investigated. Freshly laid eggs were stored at 23 C for 48 hr and then hard cooked {{by one of}} three methods: {{steaming}} (S) for 20 min; severe boiling (B) procedure (<b>water</b> brought <b>to</b> <b>a</b> full <b>boil</b> and maintained for 20 min); and a standard hard cook (SHC) pro-cedure (<b>water</b> brought <b>to</b> <b>a</b> slow <b>boil</b> followed by 20 min simmer). The eggs were peeled, separated into yolk and white, and evaluated for pH, moisture, color, texture by an Instron Texturometer and texture profile panel, and flavor by a trained profile panel, experienced panel, and headspace gas chromatography. Eggs subjected to the B procedure had the highest endpoint temperature (98. 7 C) followed by SHC (95. 6 C) and S eggs (89. 4 C). The cooking rate for S eggs was approximately three times faster than SHC or B eggs. Both egg white moisture and pH values were significantly influenced by cooking method. Severely boiled egg whites had significantly lower pH moisture values than SHC or S eggs. Small but perceivable texture differences due to cooking were found by the texture profile panel in addition to significant egg white and yolk texture differences as measured using the Instron. Severely boiled egg whites had the firmest texture followed by SHC and S egg whites. All treatments had a typical egg aroma and flavor, yet several detectable sensory {{differences were found between}} the treatments. There were little qualitative differences in headspace volatiles between treatments, although significant quantitative differences were noted between treatments for eggs yolks and whites.
