5|$|In {{the poem}} Alvíssmál, Thor tricks a dwarf, Alvíss, to his doom upon finding that {{he seeks to}} wed his {{daughter}} (unnamed, possibly Þrúðr). As the poem starts, Thor meets a dwarf who talks about getting married. Thor finds the dwarf repulsive and, apparently, realizes that the bride is his daughter. Thor comments that the wedding agreement was made among the gods while Thor was gone, and that the dwarf must seek his consent. To do so, Thor says, Alvíss must tell him <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> know {{about all of the}} worlds that the dwarf has visited. In a long question and answer session, Alvíss does exactly that; he describes natural features as they are known in the languages of various races of beings in the world, and gives an amount of cosmological lore.|$|E
5|$|The medieval setting {{has been}} the {{traditional}} background for epic fantasy. However, where historical fiction leaves versed readers knowing the historical outcome, original characters may increase suspense and empathy for the readers. Yet Martin felt historical fiction, particularly when set during the Middle Ages, had an excitement, grittiness, and a realness to it that was absent in fantasy with a similar backdrop. Thus, he wanted to combine the realism of historical fiction with the magic appeal of the best fantasies, subduing magic in favor of battles and political intrigue. He also decided to avoid the conventional good versus evil setting typical for the genre, using the fight between Achilles and Hector in Homer's Iliad, where no one stands out as either a hero or a villain, {{as an example of}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> achieve with his books.|$|E
5|$|The Smoking Man {{meets with}} the Syndicate, who are {{responsible}} for the bees. Soon afterward a swarm of bees attacks a school in Columbia, South Carolina, and one of the teachers dies as a result. Skinner heads to the hospital, where he is met by Covarrubias. She demands to know what he knows about the matter. He tells her he believes that the bees are being used as a carrier for some sort of experiment. Skinner returns home where he is confronted by Mulder, who now suspects that Skinner has been working against him all this time. Skinner is able to convince Mulder that he would not have forced his own drawer lock open and hence could not have been the murderer. Convinced of Skinner's evidence, Mulder turns in the gun with the serial number filed off so Skinner is not blamed for the murder. That night Skinner confronts The Smoking Man in his apartment, angry that nothing has been done for Scully. The Smoking Man convinces him that Scully will die if he kills him and Skinner leaves without killing him, but not before firing warning shots. Shortly afterwards Covarrubias calls The Smoking Man, who tells her to tell Mulder <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> hear while an unknown man is shown behind her listening on another phone.|$|E

25|$|Halakha (Jewish law) {{generally}} {{allows for}} divorce. The document of divorce is termed a get. The final divorce ceremony involves the husband giving the get document into {{the hand of}} the wife or her agent, but the wife may sue in rabbinical court to initiate the divorce. In such a case, a husband may be compelled to give the get, if he has violated any of his numerous obligations; this was traditionally accomplished by beating and or monetary coercion. The rationale was that since he was required to divorce his wife due to his (or her) violations of the contract, his good inclination desires to divorce her, and the community helps him to do <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> do anyway. In this case, the wife {{may or may not be}} entitled to a payment.|$|E

500|$|Dylan {{has stated}} {{that he had to}} {{overcome}} considerable resistance at Columbia Records to give the album its title. He told biographer Robert Shelton: [...] "I wanted to call that album Highway 61 Revisited. Nobody understood it. I had to go up the fucking ladder until finally the word came down and said: 'Let him call it <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> call it'." [...] Michael Gray has suggested that the very title of the album represents Dylan's insistence that his songs are rooted in the traditions of the blues: [...] "Indeed the album title Highway 61 Revisited announces that we are in for a long revisit, since it is such a long, blues-travelled highway. Many bluesmen had been there before , all recording versions of a blues called 'Highway 61'." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison's {{staging of}} the two benefit concerts {{enhanced}} his standing as {{the most popular of}} the former Beatles; Doggett describes him as having become [...] "arguably music's most influential figure" [...] over this period. In a laudatory review of the Concert for Bangladesh album, for Rolling Stone, Jon Landau described [...] "Wah-Wah" [...] as [...] "a simple statement by a musician who knows who he is and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> play". Like Rodriguez, who considers that the song [...] "truly [...] into its own" [...] that day, Andrew Grant Jackson views this live reading as superior to the studio recording. He writes: [...] "The live version is a notch slower, and the cleaner mix allows breathing room to hear the space between the instruments. And more importantly, there's the euphoria of the performance itself." ...|$|E

500|$|Miguel {{collaborated with}} Silvetti for the {{arrangement}} of Romances, while Manzanero {{was in charge of}} direction. [...] Recording began on 18 March 1997, at Ocean Way Recording in Hollywood and at The Hit Factory in New York City. During the recording of Romances, as in Romance, Silvetti employed his signature style of arrangements known as the [...] "Silvetti Sound", which Leila Cobo of Billboard describes as [...] "anchored in sweeping melodies, lush string arrangements, acoustic instrumentation, and above all, unabashed romanticism". Silvetti has stated that when he produces an album he does not simply copy his own arrangements, because he feels that would be [...] "ridiculous", and prefers to be creative within his own style. About the selection of songs for the album, Manzanero stated that [...] "I give [...] the songs, and he chooses <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> record." [...] Participants in the recording sessions included sixty-one musicians from the Los Angeles Philharmonic.|$|E
500|$|Presley {{undertook}} three brief tours {{during the}} year, continuing {{to generate a}} crazed audience response. A Detroit newspaper suggested that [...] "the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed." [...] Villanova students pelted him with eggs in Philadelphia, and in Vancouver, the crowd rioted {{after the end of}} the show, destroying the stage. Frank Sinatra, who had famously inspired the swooning of teenaged girls in the 1940s, condemned the new musical phenomenon. In a magazine article, he decried rock and roll as [...] "brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious.... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons.... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore." [...] Asked for a response, Presley said, [...] "I admire the man. He has a right to say <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it.... This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite its prevalence, {{the neoclassical}} {{synthesis}} had its Keynesian critics. A strain of disequilibrium or [...] "non-Walrasian" [...] theory developed that criticized the synthesis for apparent contradictions in allowing disequilibrium phenomena, especially involuntary unemployment, to be modeled in equilibrium models. Moreover, they argued, {{the presence of}} disequilibrium in one market must be associated with disequilibrium in another, so involuntary unemployment had to be tied to an excess supply in the goods market. Many see Don Patinkin's work as {{the first in the}} disequilibrium vein. Robert W. Clower (1965) introduced his [...] "dual-decision hypothesis" [...] that a person in a market may determine <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> buy, but is ultimately limited in how much he can buy based on how much he can sell. Clower and Axel Leijonhufvud (1968) argued that disequilibrium formed a fundamental part of Keynes's theory and deserved greater attention. Robert Barro and Herschel Grossman formulated general disequilibrium models in which individual markets were locked into prices before there was a general equilibrium. These markets produced [...] "false prices" [...] resulting in disequilibrium. Soon after the work of Barro and Grossman, disequilibrium models fell out of favor in the United States, and Barro abandoned Keynesianism and adopted new classical, market clearing hypotheses.|$|E

Arnold Vosloo also confirmed that he would reprise his role of Zartan, although in the final film Vosloo appears only in a couple of non-dialogue scenes, with Jonathan Pryce playing Zartan in most scenes. Joseph Mazzello was confirmed to play Mouse. In August 2011, Walton Goggins was added as Warden Nigel James, and it was confirmed that Bruce Willis was cast to star in the film as the original G.I. Joe. The character of Joe Colton was a replacement for fan-favorite Joe character Sgt. Slaughter. Sgt. Slaughter stated that he [...] "was originally supposed to be the part of Bruce Willis' [...] Sgt. Slaughter but because we had a conflict in toy companies, Hasbro and Mattel, I wasn't able to do it.

From the child's initial hesitation in making use of the spatula, Winnicott derived his idea of the necessary 'period of hesitation' in childhood (or analysis), which makes possible a true connection to the toy, interpretation or object presented for transference.|$|E
