5|$|The natural {{environment}} of Poole is characterised by lowland heathland {{to the north}} and wooded chines and coastline to the south. The heathland habitat supports the six native British reptile species and provides a home for a range of dragonflies and rare birds. Development has destroyed much of the heath but scattered fragments remain to the north of Poole and have been designated Special Protection Areas. The town lies on unresistant beds of Eocene clays (mainly London Clay and Gault Clay), sands and gravels. The River Frome runs through this <b>weak</b> <b>rock,</b> and its many tributaries have carved out a wide estuary. At the mouth of the estuary sand spits have been deposited, enclosing the estuary to create Poole Harbour.|$|E
25|$|The formation's thick bedding, {{extensive}} cementation and dolomitisation {{have made}} it a generally stable engineering material. Tunnelling has been possible almost throughout the Rock, {{with the exception of}} one region where it has been precluded due to high ground water pressures. In some areas, zones of <b>weak</b> <b>rock</b> or intrusions of the underlying or overlying 'shales' have caused tunnel instability.|$|E
25|$|The TBM faced many {{challenges}} during the tunneling. Much of the tunneling {{took place in}} water-bearing strata of metamorphic and granitic rock. The presence of water, coupled with {{the depth of the}} tunnel, up to 1,100 feet underground, forced the tunneling team to deal with water pressures in excess of 150 pounds per square inch. Additionally, the tunnel alignment crossed or traversed near several significant faults and shear zones, including branches of the San Andreas and Arrowhead Springs Faults. In these faulted areas, the massive blocks of rock were broken into fine debris that were treated with grout before tunneling could safely cross through these zones. A particularly challenging reach of the tunnel alignment was encountered in the last 1,500 feet of the tunneling work as the TBM crossed five significant fault and shear zones along the tunnel alignment on its way to completion at the Devil Canyon Portal. While tunneling in this zone in mid-2008, the TBM began dipping as it encountered a 40-foot-wide fault zone of completely crushed, <b>weak</b> <b>rock.</b> Concrete and steel foundation pads were constructed in front of the cutter head to stabilize the TBM and correct the alignment of the machine as it crossed the weak ground within the fault zone. The tunnel was completed in August 2008, with installation of pipeline being completed in 2009.|$|E
40|$|Provides {{guidance}} {{on the use}} of the Standard Penetration Test (SPT) in geotechnical engineering. Used world-wide in a variety of ground conditions, this simple test is relied upon to provide information about the properties of soils and <b>weak</b> <b>rocks</b> and as a basis for design. The report examines the variability of SPT results, whether caused by the methods of drilling and testing or influenced by ground conditions. The principal uses of the SPT are examined, i. e., ground investigation profiling, soil classification, the determination of geotechnical design parameters and for direct design. Suggested methods are proposed and outlined for the determination from SPT results of geotechnical parameters for granular soils, cohesive soils, <b>weak</b> <b>rocks</b> and chalk. Similarly, suggested direct design methods are discussed for the settlements of shallow foundations on granular soil, for piles in soils, <b>weak</b> <b>rocks</b> and chalk, and for estimating liquefaction potential and sheet-pile driveability in granular soils. <br/...|$|R
50|$|Paternoster lakes {{occur in}} alpine valleys, {{climbing}} {{one after the}} other to the valley's head, called a corrie, which often contains a cirque lake. Paternoster lakes are created by recessional moraines, or rock dams, that are formed by the advance and subsequent upstream retreat and melting of the ice. The local variation in rock types can also be a factor in creating these lakes. A glacier encountering <b>weaker</b> <b>rock</b> at its base, will be able to erode deeper than when it experiences harder, less erodible rocks. As the glacier melts, lakes form where <b>weaker</b> <b>rock</b> was excavated.|$|R

The town is built on weak sand and clay rock which in most places along the Dorset coast, except for narrow bands at Lulworth Cove, Swanage and Durdle Door, has been eroded and transported away. This <b>weak</b> <b>rock</b> has been protected at Weymouth by Chesil Beach and the strong limestone Isle of Portland that lies offshore, [...] south of Wyke Regis.

500|$|During its construction, {{numerous}} cave-ins and landslides {{occurred because}} of the fragile and <b>weak</b> <b>rock</b> the tunnel passed through, and at one point, an outbreak of cholera forced work to stop. [...] By October 1856 the tunnel was completed {{at a cost of}} $114,600, having been lined with a thick elliptical brick arch to hold back the earth. [...] The Brookville Tunnel was used by the Virginia Central Railroad, and after 1868, the line's successor, the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. [...] After the reorganization of the line in 1878 as the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, the tunnel continued to be used until it was demolished and replaced by a cut during the construction of Interstate 64 in the 1960s and 1970s, at which point it was one of only two of Crozet's original four tunnels still in use.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{some aspects}} of the hydromechanical behaviour of argillaceous hard soils and <b>weak</b> <b>rocks.</b> After considering the wide variety of this class of materials, some common behaviour features are sought concerning compressibility, structure development, uplift and swelling, microfabric, anisotropy, effects of discontinuities and hydraulic properties. Those features are examined in the context of appropriate behaviour frameworks developed for this type of materials. Two themes are then selected for special consideration: brittleness and progressive failure and the response of argillaceous <b>weak</b> <b>rocks</b> to deep underground excavations. For the second topic, particular attention is given to field results obtained in deep underground laboratories for nuclear waste disposal. The paper concludes with a summary of the main points.

40|$|The Athens Schist Formation {{includes}} {{a wide variety}} of metasedimentary rocks, varying from strong or medium strong rocks such as sericite metasandstone, limestone, greywacke, sericite schist through to <b>weak</b> <b>rocks</b> such as metasiltstone, clayey and silty shale and phyllite. The overall rock mass is highly heterogeneous and anisotropic owing to the combined effect of advanced weathering and severe tectonic stressing that gave rise to intense folding and shearing followed by extensional faulting, which resulted in highly weathered rock masses and numerous shear and/or mylonite zones with distinct downgraded engineering properties. This paper is focused on the applicability of the GSI classification system to these highly heterogeneous rock masses and proposes an extension of the GSI system to account for the foliated or laminated <b>weak</b> <b>rocks</b> in the lower range of its applicability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Weak</b> {{intercalated}} <b>rock</b> {{plays an}} important role in the stability of engineering rock mass. It controls the mechanism of deformation and breakage of rocks. Systematic numerical tests have been carried out to study the stability of surrounding rock mass with different distributions of <b>weak</b> intercalated <b>rock</b> has been analyzed by the FEM software ABAQUS. All of the numerical modelings are plain-strain type with elasto-plastic constitutive law and Drucker-Prager failure criterion. Some quantificational results about the influence of <b>weak</b> intercalated <b>rock</b> are summarized, especially the influence on the deformation, stress of surrounding rocks and plastic zone. Because of <b>weak</b> intercalated <b>rock,</b> the stress of surrounding rock appears the character of discontinuity. In addition, the distribution of plastic zone is also affected. When <b>weak</b> intercalated <b>rocks</b> exist in vault, spandrel and bottom, the situation of surrounding rock is comparatively unfavorable. These results have a certain role in guiding significance to the site selection and layout, the majorization of supporting system and the construction of tunnel of the same kind...|$|R
2500|$|The {{compliance}} of rock layers {{is referred}} to as competence: a competent layer or bed of rock can withstand an applied load without collapsing and is relatively strong, while an incompetent layer is relatively weak. [...] When rock behaves as a fluid, {{as in the case of}} very <b>weak</b> <b>rock</b> such as rock salt, or any rock that is buried deeply enough, it typically shows flow folding (also called passive folding, because little resistance is offered): the strata appear shifted undistorted, assuming any shape impressed upon them by surrounding more rigid rocks. The strata simply serve as markers of the folding. Such folding is also a feature of many igneous intrusions and glacier ice.|$|E
2500|$|Hampshire's geology {{falls into}} two categories. In the south, {{along the coast}} is the [...] "Hampshire Basin", an area of {{relatively}} non-resistant Eocene and Oligocene clays and gravels which are protected from sea erosion by the Isle of Purbeck, Dorset, and the Isle of Wight. These low, flat lands support heathland and woodland habitats, a large area of which forms part of the New Forest. The New Forest has a mosaic of heathland, grassland, coniferous and deciduous woodland habitats that host diverse wildlife. The forest is protected as a national park, limiting development and agricultural use to protect the landscape and wildlife. Large areas of the New Forest are open common lands kept as a grassland plagioclimax by grazing animals, including domesticated cattle, pigs and horses, and several wild deer species. Erosion of the <b>weak</b> <b>rock</b> and sea level change flooding the low land has carved several large estuaries and rias, notably the [...] long Southampton Water and the large convoluted Portsmouth Harbour. The Isle of Wight lies {{off the coast of}} Hampshire where the non-resistant rock has been eroded away, forming the Solent.|$|E
2500|$|The {{main purpose}} of the test is to provide an {{indication}} of the relative density of granular deposits, such as sands and gravels from which {{it is virtually impossible to}} obtain undisturbed samples. [...] The great merit of the test, and the main reason for its widespread use is that it is simple and inexpensive. The soil strength parameters which can be inferred are approximate, but may give a useful guide in ground conditions where it may not be possible to obtain borehole samples of adequate quality like gravels, sands, silts, clay containing sand or gravel and <b>weak</b> <b>rock.</b> In conditions where the quality of the undisturbed sample is suspect, e.g., very silty or very sandy clays, or hard clays, it is often advantageous to alternate the sampling with standard penetration tests to check the strength. If the samples are found to be unacceptably disturbed, it may be necessary to use a different method for measuring strength like the plate test. [...] When the test is carried out in granular soils below groundwater level, the soil may become loosened. In certain circumstances, it can be useful to continue driving the sampler beyond the distance specified, adding further drilling rods as necessary. Although this is not a standard penetration test, and should not be regarded as such, it may at least give an indication as to whether the deposit is really as loose as the standard test may indicate.|$|E
30|$|Differential {{weathering}} {{and erosion}} of various rock types {{has resulted in}} such relief variation. The low relief area is basically consisting of <b>weaker</b> <b>rocks</b> like slate and phyllite, while quartzite, gneiss and dolomitic limestones give rise to higher relief with sharp crested ridge because of relatively resistant to weathering and erosion.|$|R
50|$|During the Carboniferous, the {{relationship}} between the Market Weighton Axis and the London-Brabant Massif affected the <b>weaker</b> <b>rocks</b> between them so influencing the geography at the surface.

50|$|Subsequent streams are streams whose {{course has}} been {{determined}} by selective headward erosion along weak strata. These streams have generally developed after the original stream. Subsequent streams developed independently of the original relief {{of the land and}} generally follow paths determined by the <b>weak</b> <b>rock</b> belts.|$|E
50|$|On coasts two {{different}} types of arches can form depending on the geology. On discordant coastlines rock types run at 90Â° to the coast. Wave refraction concentrates the wave energy on the headland, and an arch forms when caves break through the headland. Two examples of this type of arch are London Archpreviously known as London Bridgein Victoria, Australia, and Neil Island in Andaman, India. When these arches eventually collapse, they form stacks and stumps. On concordant coastlines rock types run parallel to the coastline, with <b>weak</b> <b>rock</b> such as shale protected by stronger rock such as limestone. The wave action along concordant coastlines breaks through the strong rock and then erodes the <b>weak</b> <b>rock</b> very quickly. Good examples of this type of arch are the Durdle Door and Stair Hole near Lulworth Cove on Dorset's Jurassic Coast in south England. When Stair Hole eventually collapses it will form a cove.|$|E

40|$|Thirty {{bulk samples}} of hard soils-soft rocks such as marls, {{originating}} from Euboea Island and Peloponnesus area, were investigated {{to evaluate their}} geotechnical behavior. Specifically, by conducting a series of physical and geotechnical tests, such as liquid limit and plastic limit tests, along with the estimation of the grain size fraction, Slake Durability and Point Load Test. Certain parameters were determined and used for empirical correlations with their mineralogical characteristics. The mineralogical composition was determined by X-ray diffraction, thermo-gravimetric and thermal analysis, succeeded by textural analysis performed by Optical Microscope. With {{the help of the}} above mentioned tests, we interpreted the observed geotechnical behavior of the examined <b>weak</b> <b>rocks</b> by means of mineralogical composition and texture. Durability and the unconfined compressive strength was found to be influenced by high percentages in carbonate minerals.

50|$|Decomposed granite is rock of {{granitic}} origin {{that has}} weathered {{to the point}} that it readily fractures into smaller pieces of <b>weak</b> <b>rock.</b> Further weathering produces rock that easily crumbles into mixtures of gravel-sized particles, sand, and silt-sized particles with some clay. Eventually, the gravel may break down to produce a mixture of silica sand, silt particles, and clay. Different specific granite types have differing propensities to weather, and so differing likelihoods of producing decomposed granite.|$|E

40|$|The Point Load Test (PLT) was {{developed}} as an index test to predict he Uniaxial Compressive Strength (UCS) of core too broken for UCS testing.

This paper investigates the value of K for chalk and other <b>weak</b> <b>rocks</b> using published and unpublished ata sets and concludes that K is not a unique value even for a single set of specimens but is strength dependent, generally being between 10 and 20 for weaker ock (< 25 MPa). It is often less than 10 for rocks of 5 MPa strength or less. Operator error is evaluated and considered to contribute {{to much of the}} reported scatter in Point Load Test results.
