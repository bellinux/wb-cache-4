40|$|The {{objective}} of condition monitoring of induction machines is {{to detect the}} incipient stage of a fault before serious damage occurs with high associated cost. Although the condition monitoring techniques have been intensively investigated in the last decades, research is still carried out in reducing cost and improving accuracy. This paper proposes a novel method that enables efficient and accurate monitoring of the stator <b>winding</b> <b>circuit</b> fault. The proposed method {{is based on the}} sparse grid optimization method applied in the least squares estimation of the circuit parameters that characterize the condition of a fault incipient. The kernel of the method is the efficient search for the objective function minimum on the grid created by using the hyperbolic cross points (HCPs). The system cost and complexity are minimized since the proposed method only requires voltage and current signals recorded at a machine terminal without any invasive or additional hardware circuitry. The proposed HCP algorithm is robust to supply voltage unbalance and motor loading state. The validity and effectiveness of the proposed scheme is experimentally tested on a three-phase 800 -W 380 -V induction motor. Fang Duan and Rastko Živanovic...|$|E

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{development of}} vehicles in wind tunnels is currently performed via {{a series of}} static measurements. However, vehicles exploiting ground effect tend to be highly dynamic undergoing rapid changes in speed and attitude. Clearly therefore there is scope for an improvement in the fidelity of testing. At present the considerable diffculty of measuring body forces whilst simultaneously making variations to a model attitude prohibits transient investigations. Satisfying the demand for a dynamic testing capability formed {{the initial stages of}} the research. Having established the present performance of the hardware and software in use at the R. J.

Experimental system identification methods were employed to determine the dynamic response of the force balance and pressure transducers. This knowledge was integrated into a data processing algorithm that effectively isolated the aerodynamic effects during the transient investigation. As automotive vehicle models can be considered as bluff bodies their movement during dynamic testing has the potential to alter the test section wind speed due to varying blockage effects. To overcome this a controller was developed to maintain a constant wind speed. Tests were performed to allow the fan drive system and <b>wind</b> <b>circuit</b> to be characterised. The system was found to be non-linear a gain scheduling controller was therefore developed that improved the control of wind speed control without employing a complex non-linear controller.
