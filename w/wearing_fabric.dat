50|$|The West River {{provided}} {{water power}} {{at the outset of}} the American Industrial Revolution, providing power to a textile mill founded by Luke Taft in 1825, which later became the site of the Waucantuck Mill Complex where wash and <b>wear</b> <b>fabrics</b> originated. About 1810 Taft's father-in-law, Daniel Day, started an early wool-carding mill where the West River joins the Blackstone River. The Daniel Day woolen mill was one of the first US woolen mills. The Blackstone River Valley is a U.S. National Heritage Area and a major contributing region to America's Industrial Revolution.|$|R

The mural containing the figure of Hariti from Farhad-beg-yailaki is thought to specifically demonstrate the Khotanese school of painting style, which was highly admired in contemporary China and was in high demand during the late Sui Dynasty. This style of painting was also regarded highly in Tibet and is thought to have {{had a significant impact on}} Tibetan culture during the eighth century.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: PUVASOL {{therapy has}} an {{inherent}} drawback of patient compliance in that Indian female patients with psoriasis lesions on covered {{parts of the}} body are reluctant to expose themselves. In this study we tried to evaluate a new method of administering PUVA therapy <b>wearing</b> a <b>fabric.</b> AIM: To compare the efficacy and safety of PUVA administration with and without wearing clothes in psoriasis. METHOD: We first found the UV transmissibility of plain woven, lightweight cream colored cotton fabric with 30 x 30 threads per square cm. area and calculated its sun protection factor (SPF). A single blind, randomized, comparative, clinical trial was then conducted on 21 patients with psoriasis vulgaris who were treated with bath PUVA. The study group received ultraviolet light while wearing a gown made up of the above cotton fabric and the control group received ultraviolet light without wearing the gown. The study group was given an UV dose higher in proportion to the SPF of the <b>worn</b> <b>fabric</b> so that blockage caused by cloth could be neutralized. The cloth-uncovered areas were covered with a sunscreen. UVA from artificial light source was used for better patient monitoring. RESULTS: After 12 PUVA treatments both the treatments were found to be equally effective, and there were no differences in the side effects. Conclusion: Thus we conclude that PUVA can be given <b>wearing</b> a <b>fabric</b> provided the UV dosage is increased proportional to the SPF of the fabric. The same fabric may be used for PUVASOL therapy...|$|R
5000|$|Clothing {{is chosen}} for comfort during {{physical}} exertion in the backcountry, {{and its ability}} to withstand falls. Road touring clothes are often inappropriate due to their delicate fabrics and construction. Depending on the type of mountain biking, different types of clothes and styles are commonly worn. Cross-country mountain bikers tend to wear lycra shorts and tight road style jerseys due to the need for comfort and efficiency. Downhill riders tend to <b>wear</b> heavier <b>fabric</b> baggy shorts or moto-cross style trousers in order to protect themselves from falls. All mountain/enduro riders tend to <b>wear</b> light <b>fabric</b> baggy shorts and jerseys as they can be in the saddle for long periods of time.|$|R

50|$|Despite {{improvements}} to the uniform such as wash and <b>wear</b> <b>fabrics</b> and improved NIR coverage, the uniform still has known problems. One {{of the most common}} complaints is that the uniform is too hot for wear in high temperature environments. In 2008, responding to these criticisms that the new Airman Battle Uniform was too heavy and hot, the USAF's 648th Aeronautical Systems Squadron at Brooks City-Base revealed their plans for a switch to a lighter, more breathable fabric with the combat blouse section of the ABU. The original heavyweight nylon/cotton blend was changed to a lighter-weight nylon/cotton poplin material. Priority will go to those serving in the Middle East or other hot-weather theaters.|$|R

5000|$|The Waucantuck Mill Complex was a mill {{complex in}} Uxbridge, Massachusetts. Despite its 2010 demolition, (except for a {{historic}} storage building) {{it is still}} listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The original Luke Taft Mill, built in 1824, on the West River {{was very close to}} the present site of the Waucatuck Mill complex. The Waucantuck complex was planned for a condominium and retail complex, underway in 2009. Both are very close to and virtually part of the Wheelockville District, where the Stanley Woolen Mill was built in 1852. Wash and <b>wear</b> <b>fabrics</b> were first developed at this mill in the 20th century. Products were produced under the name of [...] "Indian Head". In the 1960s the former holdings of American Woolen Company were eventually acquired by a company by that name in Uxbridge, MA. Originally the Uxbridge Worsted Company had proposed a buyout of American Woolen to become America's largest woolen conglomerate. The Town of Uxbridge was synonymous with the textile industry and its earliest and later developments. [...] The [...] "Waucantuck Mill Complex" [...] structure was razed in 2010 because of contaminated industrial wastes, and the main complex is gone, {{with the exception of one}} or more storage buildings, though the site remains. A historic marker is planned. The site is the geographic center of the John H. Chaffee Blackstone River Valley National Historic Corridor, a region of national significance to the earliest industrialization of the United States. The Luke Taft Mill, and its successors were important footnotes in the early textile industry of the US. Innovations here included power looms, satinets, mixed textile blends, and wash and <b>wear</b> <b>fabrics.</b>|$|R

50|$|Rallis {{are made}} from scraps of cotton fabric dyed to the desired color. The most common colors are white, black, red, and yellow or orange with green, dark blue, or purple. For the bottoms of the rallis, the women use old pieces of tie-dye, ajrak, or other shawl fabric. Ralli quilts have a few layers of <b>worn</b> <b>fabric</b> or cotton fibers between {{the top and bottom}} layers. The layers are held {{together}} by thick colored thread stitched in straight lines. The women sit on the ground and do not use a quilting frame. Another kind of ralli quilt is the sami ralli, used by the samis and jogis. This type of ralli quilt is popular due to the many colors and the extensive hand-stitching employed in its construction.|$|R
