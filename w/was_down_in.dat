He was {{defeated}} at numerous competitions, only winning a 10K race in Avalon, New Jersey, but on {{his return to the}} New York Marathon he lodged a successful defence, winning the race for a second time. He won by a margin of three seconds, ahead of compatriot Joseph Chebet who would himself win the same race a year later.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday, {{conditions}} were so poor, with visibility down to mere ten yards, that the organizers scheduled an additional practice session for Sunday morning. Still many drivers {{slid off the}} track during the morning session. Eventually, Jacky Ickx took pole positions by a full 10 seconds from second placed Chris Amon, both in a Ferrari. Jackie Stewart in his Matra MS10 <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> sixth place on the grid. At the time, Ickx became the youngest person ever to sit on pole, a record beaten 14 years later when Andrea de Cesaris achieved pole position at the 1982 United States Grand Prix West.|$|E

Aboard the Lady Elgin, Captain Wilson ordered that cattle and cargo be thrown {{overboard}} to lighten the load and raise the gaping hole in the Lady Elgin's port side above water level while the steward <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> the coal bunker {{trying to stop the}} leak with mattresses. Captain Wilson ordered a lifeboat lowered on the starboard side to check the extent of the damage but it never regained the steamer. Within twenty minutes, the Lady Elgin broke apart, and all but the bow section rapidly sank. The night was lit up at intervals by flashes of lightning showing the scattered wreckage.|$|E

Despite the fight being a welterweight eliminator, it was agreed to be fought with a 143-pound maximum. Alvarado weighed in at 143.2 lbs.

500|$|In 1959 Alfred Lansing's [...] was published. This was {{the first}} of a number of books about Shackleton that began to appear, showing him in a highly {{positive}} light. At the same time, attitudes towards Scott were gradually changing as a more critical note was sounded in the literature, culminating in Roland Huntford's 1979 treatment of him in his dual biography Scott and Amundsen, described by Barczewski as a [...] "devastating attack". This negative picture of Scott became accepted as the popular truth as the kind of heroism that Scott represented fell victim to the cultural shifts of the late twentieth century. Within a few years he was thoroughly overtaken in public esteem by Shackleton, whose popularity surged while that of his erstwhile rival declined. In 2002, in a BBC poll conducted to determine the [...] "100 Greatest Britons", Shackleton was ranked 11th while Scott <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> 54th place.|$|E

[...] Very aware of how precarious his own position was, Yohannes recognized Menelik as Negus of Shewa and gave him numerous presents which included four cannons, several hundred modern Remington rifles, and ammunition for both.

Bob was, in recent years, pretty much into fitness, and he worked hard at his running ... I'm no doctor. But he did not die drunk, which may have amazed a number of his colleagues". Jack Gifford concurred: [...] "He didn't die as a derelict. He wasn't, I mean he was fine. He was coherent.
