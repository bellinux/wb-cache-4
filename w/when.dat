5|$|A 1947 fire {{destroyed}} the clubhouse of the Toronto Argonaut Rowing Club and damaged the Grey Cup. Many other trophies and artifacts {{in the clubhouse}} melted or were damaged beyond repair but the Grey Cup survived by catching onto a nail <b>when</b> the shelf upon which it sat collapsed. The trophy has been broken on six other occasions: in 1978, <b>when</b> it was dropped by celebrating Edmonton Eskimos players; in 1987, <b>when</b> an Eskimos' player sat on it; in 1993, <b>when</b> Edmonton's Blake Dermott head-butted it; in 2006, <b>when</b> the trophy broke away from its base as the BC Lions celebrated their victory; in 2012 <b>when</b> one of the handles broke off as the Toronto Argonauts celebrated; and finally in 2014 <b>when</b> trophy broke from its base again by the Calgary Stampeders after their win. The CFL commissioned {{a replica of the}} trophy in 2008.|$|E
5|$|A tragedy {{occurred}} at the stadium in March 1992 <b>when</b> 17-year-old apprentice footballer Ben Lee {{was killed in a}} fall from the roof of the Longside Stand, <b>when</b> trying to retrieve a football.|$|E
5|$|Asch {{showed that}} simple {{properties}} would enter into associations much easier <b>when</b> {{they are part}} of the same unit than <b>when</b> they are from different units.|$|E
5|$|At an {{unscheduled}} session, Albert expresses {{his frustration}} that while his speech has improved <b>when</b> talking to most people, he still stammers <b>when</b> talking to David and reveals {{the extent of}} Edward VIII's folly with Simpson. <b>When</b> Lionel insists that Bertie {{could be a good}} king, Bertie accuses Lionel of speaking treason and quits Lionel. Bertie must face the Ascension Council without any assistance from Lionel.|$|E
5|$|Cascade filling may be {{used for}} {{efficiency}} <b>when</b> multiple storage cylinders are available. High-pressure storage is commonly used <b>when</b> blending nitrox, heliox and trimix diving gases, and for oxygen for rebreathers and decompression gas.|$|E
5|$|Chief cells, which {{synthesize}} {{and release}} parathyroid hormone. These cells are small, and appear dark <b>when</b> loaded with parathyroid hormone, and clear <b>when</b> the hormone has been secreted, {{or in their}} resting state.|$|E
5|$|Common {{onions are}} {{normally}} available in three colour varieties. Yellow or brown onions (called red in some European countries), are full-flavoured {{and are the}} onions of choice for everyday use. Yellow onions turn a rich, dark brown <b>when</b> caramelised and give French onion soup its sweet flavour. The red onion (called purple in some European countries) {{is a good choice}} for fresh use <b>when</b> its colour livens up the dish; it is also used in grilling. White onions are the traditional onions used in classic Mexican cuisine; they have a golden colour <b>when</b> cooked and a particularly sweet flavour <b>when</b> sautéed.|$|E
5|$|Cyril's {{employment}} as a policeman causes Betty problems <b>when</b> Keith Lucas (David Webb), {{a man he}} has previously arrested, begins stalking her. She initially refrains from telling Cyril, fearing that he will get into trouble. <b>When</b> Cyril finds out, he attacks Lucas {{with a piece of}} lead piping and has to leave the police force. Betty has a breakdown <b>when</b> Cyril dies {{of a heart attack in}} 1974, leaving her only £859. The same year the truth about her illegitimate son is revealed, and <b>when</b> the community discovers this, Betty finds it difficult to face them. She busies herself by taking in lodgers, and acquiring a ginger cat named Marmaduke for extra companionship. Betty builds a relationship with Gordon, though he upsets her occasionally, particularly <b>when</b> he neglects to invite her to his wedding.|$|E
5|$|Deathmatch. Every man for himself. The game ends <b>when</b> {{a player}} reaches the score limit, or <b>when</b> time expires.|$|E
5|$|Division {{shown in}} bold <b>when</b> it changes due to promotion, relegation or league reorganisation. Top scorer shown in bold <b>when</b> he set or equalled a club record.|$|E
5|$|Four {{different}} attachment classifications {{have been}} identified in children: secure attachment, anxious-ambivalent attachment, anxious-avoidant attachment, and disorganized attachment. Secure attachment is <b>when</b> children feel they can rely on their caregivers to attend to their needs of proximity, emotional support and protection. It is considered to be the best attachment style. Anxious-ambivalent attachment is <b>when</b> the infant feels separation anxiety <b>when</b> separated from the caregiver and does not feel reassured <b>when</b> the caregiver returns to the infant. Anxious-avoidant attachment is <b>when</b> the infant avoids their parents. Disorganized attachment is <b>when</b> {{there is a lack of}} attachment behavior.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, {{foraging}} birds may feed actively on {{the substrate}} or pick grains {{dropped on the}} ground and these strategies may be chosen according to the situation. Early departures occur more often <b>when</b> expected searching time decreases and <b>when</b> competition intensity increases. Competition intensity is expected to increase <b>when</b> more scroungers are present or <b>when</b> patches are smaller.|$|E
5|$|García's first {{exposure}} to the Spanish youth teams came <b>when</b> she was just fifteen-years old <b>when</b> she was called up to replace a player who was unable to travel with the U17 team.|$|E
5|$|Governmental funds, {{which are}} not {{concerned}} about profitability, usually rely on a modified accrual basis. This involves recognizing revenue <b>when</b> it becomes both available and measurable, rather than <b>when</b> it is earned. Expenditures, a term preferred over expenses for modified accrual accounting, are recognized <b>when</b> the related liability is incurred.|$|E
5|$|Her parents {{moved to}} Fulham, London <b>when</b> Guillory was two, then later to Norfolk <b>when</b> she was 11. At {{the age of}} ten, she went to stay with cousins in Mexico to learn Spanish.|$|E
5|$|In 2007–08, {{the team}} {{finished}} second. In 2008–09 (<b>when</b> it also finished second), it forfeited {{the championship game}} (at home, against Apollon Limassol) <b>when</b> the referee stopped the match due spectator overcrowding.|$|E
5|$|In {{general the}} top five are listed in each {{category}} (except <b>when</b> there is a tie for the last place among the five, <b>when</b> all the tied record holders are noted).|$|E
5|$|Low-dose aspirin supplementation has {{moderate}} benefits <b>when</b> {{used for}} prevention of pre-eclampsia. This benefit is greater <b>when</b> started in early pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Malabar {{chestnut}} (Pachira aquatica), have a taste {{reminiscent of}} peanuts <b>when</b> raw, and of cashews or European chestnuts (which they strongly resemble) <b>when</b> roasted.|$|E
5|$|Motions of a bike can {{be roughly}} grouped into those {{out of the}} central plane of symmetry: lateral; {{and those in the}} central plane of symmetry: {{longitudinal}} or vertical. Lateral motions include balancing, leaning, steering, and turning. Motions in the central plane of symmetry include rolling forward, of course, but also stoppies, wheelies, brake diving, and most suspension activation. Motions in these two groups are linearly decoupled, that is they do not interact with each other to the first order. An uncontrolled bike is laterally unstable <b>when</b> stationary and can be laterally self-stable <b>when</b> moving under the right conditions or <b>when</b> controlled by a rider. Conversely, a bike is longitudinally stable <b>when</b> stationary and can be longitudinally unstable <b>when</b> undergoing sufficient acceleration or deceleration.|$|E
5|$|Of course, {{the angle}} of the terrain can {{influence}} all of the calculations above. All else remaining equal, the risk of pitching over the front end is reduced <b>when</b> riding up hill and increased <b>when</b> riding down hill. The possibility of performing a wheelie increases <b>when</b> riding up hill, and is a major factor in motorcycle hillclimbing competitions.|$|E
5|$|Peace would {{continue}} {{between the two}} states until 1645, <b>when</b> a long war over Crete would break out. Cyprus itself remained under Ottoman rule until 1878, <b>when</b> it was ceded to Britain as a protectorate. Ottoman sovereignty continued until the outbreak of World War I, <b>when</b> the island was annexed by Britain, becoming a crown colony in 1925.|$|E
5|$|Peirsol caused minor {{controversy}} <b>when</b> {{he accused}} Kosuke Kitajima of Japan of using an illegal dolphin {{kick in the}} 100-meter breaststroke final <b>when</b> compatriot Brendan Hansen lost by 0.17s.|$|E
5|$|Pollinators {{have not}} been observed, and the {{flowering}} period is brief <b>when</b> compared with other banksias. However, the flowers appear <b>when</b> little else is in bloom, rendering it a valuable food source for animals.|$|E
5|$|Psilocybe aztecorum is {{the type}} species of Guzmán's section Aztecorum, a group of bluing (i.e., psilocybin-containing) Psilocybe {{mushrooms}} characterized by having a strongly hygrophanous cap that dries to brown or brownish white <b>when</b> dry; spores that appear asymmetrical <b>when</b> seen in side view; and pleurocystidia that, <b>when</b> present, are hyaline (translucent). Other species classified in section Aztecorum are P.baeocystis and P.quebecensis.|$|E
5|$|Republican President Benjamin Harrison (1889–1893) attempted, in 1893, to annex Hawaii {{through a}} Senate treaty. <b>When</b> this failed, {{he was asked}} to {{consider}} the Tyler joint house precedent; he declined. Democratic President Grover Cleveland (1893–1897) did not pursue the annexation of Hawaii. <b>When</b> President William McKinley took office in 1897, he quickly revived expectations among territorial expansionists <b>when</b> he resubmitted legislation to acquire Hawaii. <b>When</b> the two-thirds Senate support was not forthcoming, committees in the House and Senate explicitly invoked the Tyler precedent for the joint house resolution, which was successfully applied to approve the annexation of Hawaii in July 1898.|$|E
5|$|River otters {{can produce}} a snarling growl or hissing bark <b>when</b> bothered, and a shrill whistle <b>when</b> in pain. <b>When</b> at play or traveling, they {{sometimes}} give off low, purring grunts. The alarm call, given <b>when</b> shocked or distressed by potential danger, is an explosive snort, made by expelling air through the nostrils. River otters also may use a birdlike chirp for communication over longer distances, but the most common sound heard {{among a group of}} otters is low-frequency chuckling.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, even <b>when</b> blind, house sparrows {{continue}} to be photoperiodic, i.e. show reproductive development <b>when</b> the days are long, but not <b>when</b> the days are short. This response is stronger <b>when</b> the feathers {{on top of the}} head are plucked, and is eliminated <b>when</b> India ink is injected under the skin {{at the top of the}} head, showing that the photoreceptors involved in the photoperiodic response to day length are located inside the brain.|$|E
5|$|Sleep-and-charge USB ports {{can be used}} {{to charge}} {{electronic}} devices even <b>when</b> the computer is switched off. Normally, <b>when</b> a computer is powered off the USB ports are powered down, preventing phones and other devices from charging. Sleep-and-charge USB ports remain powered even <b>when</b> the computer is off. On laptops, charging devices from the USB port <b>when</b> it is not being powered from AC drains the laptop battery faster; most laptops have a facility to stop charging if their own battery charge level gets too low. This feature has also been implemented on some laptop docking stations allowing device charging even <b>when</b> no laptop is present.|$|E
5|$|Some frogs such as Bokermannohyla alvarengai, which basks in sunlight, lighten {{their skin}} colour <b>when</b> hot (and darkens <b>when</b> cold), making their skin reflect more heat and so avoid overheating.|$|E
5|$|Spotted hyenas have {{a complex}} set of postures in communication. <b>When</b> afraid, the ears are folded flat, and are often {{combined}} with baring of the teeth and a flattening of the mane. <b>When</b> attacked by other hyenas or by wild dogs, the hyena lowers its hindquarters. Before and during an assertive attack, the head is held high with the ears cocked, mouth closed, mane erect and the hindquarters high. The tail usually hangs down <b>when</b> neutral, though it will change position according to the situation. <b>When</b> a high tendency to flee an attacker is apparent, the tail is curled below the belly. During an attack, or <b>when</b> excited, the tail is carried forward on the back. An erect tail does not always accompany a hostile encounter, as it has also been observed to occur <b>when</b> a harmless social interaction occurs. Although they do not wag their tails, spotted hyenas will flick their tails <b>when</b> approaching dominant animals or <b>when</b> there is a slight tendency to flee. <b>When</b> approaching a dominant animal, subordinate spotted hyenas will walk on the knees of their forelegs in submission. Greeting ceremonies among clan-members consist of two individuals standing parallel to each other and facing opposite directions. Both individuals raise their hind legs and lick each other's anogenital area. During these greeting ceremonies, the penis or pseudo-penis often becomes erect, in both males and females. Erection is usually a sign of submission, rather than dominance, and is more common in males than in females.|$|E
5|$|Strep throat is {{unlikely}} <b>when</b> {{any of the}} symptoms of red eyes, hoarseness, runny nose, or mouth ulcers are present. It is also unlikely <b>when</b> there is no fever.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{show that}} scaly-breasted munias tend {{to adopt the}} scrounger tactic <b>when</b> food is more clumped and <b>when</b> the group size increases. <b>When</b> most foragers adopt scrounging, the time taken to {{discover}} new food patches is greater.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{has been}} criticized by liberals, such as <b>when</b> it {{excluded}} Communists from its leadership ranks, <b>when</b> it defended Neo-Nazis, <b>when</b> it declined to defend Paul Robeson, or <b>when</b> it opposed {{the passage of the}} National Labor Relations Act. Conversely, it {{has been criticized}} by conservatives, such as <b>when</b> it argued against official prayer in public schools, or <b>when</b> it opposed the Patriot Act. The ACLU has supported conservative figures such as Rush Limbaugh, George Wallace, Henry Ford, and Oliver North; and it has supported liberal figures such as Dick Gregory, Rockwell Kent, and Dr. Benjamin Spock.|$|E
5|$|The New Zealand Herald of Arms Extraordinary is {{a special}} case <b>when</b> it comes to uniform. Although they do wear the tabard, they only do so <b>when</b> in the UK {{performing}} duties. <b>When</b> in New Zealand, they simply wear morning dress as official uniform, together with their chains and baton.|$|E
5|$|The Sun's {{color is}} white, with a CIE color-space index near (0.3, 0.3), <b>when</b> viewed from space or <b>when</b> the Sun {{is high in}} the sky. <b>When</b> {{measuring}} all the photons emitted, the Sun is actually emitting more photons in the green portion of the spectrum than any other. <b>When</b> the Sun is low in the sky, atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow, red, orange, or magenta. Despite its typical whiteness, most people mentally picture the Sun as yellow; {{the reasons for this}} are the subject of debate.|$|E
