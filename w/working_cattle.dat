5|$|The breed was {{originally}} developed for general {{use on the}} farms of the Appalachian foothills, where it was found pulling plows and buggies, <b>working</b> <b>cattle</b> and being ridden by both adults and children. Today, it is still used for <b>working</b> <b>cattle,</b> as well as endurance riding and pleasure riding. The breed's gait and disposition make it sought out by elderly and disabled riders. Each September, the Kentucky Horse Park hosts the International Rocky Mountain Horse Show.|$|E
25|$|The Rottweiler has a {{reasonably}} good natural balance, force-barks when necessary, and when <b>working</b> <b>cattle</b> uses a very intimidating charge. There {{is a natural}} change in forcefulness when herding sheep. When <b>working</b> <b>cattle,</b> it may use its body and shoulders {{and for this reason}} should be used on horned stock with caution.|$|E
25|$|The Rottweiler, when <b>working</b> <b>cattle,</b> {{searches}} out {{the dominant}} animal and challenges it. Upon proving its control over that animal it settles back {{and tends to}} its work.|$|E
50|$|Broome {{was born}} in St Pancras, London, younger son of another Frank Broome, and educated at Uppingham School. After leaving school, he spent three years in Australia <b>working</b> on <b>cattle</b> ranches, {{returning}} to England in 1914.|$|R
50|$|Low stress stock {{handling}} {{schools are}} now regularly run to educate graziers, stockmen and some helicopter pilots in the <b>working</b> of <b>cattle</b> especially, and sheep as well. Drones {{are also being}} investigated, with promising results from early tests.|$|R
25|$|The {{veterinary}} discipline {{dealing with}} cattle and cattle diseases (bovine veterinary) is called buiatrics. Veterinarians and professionals <b>working</b> on <b>cattle</b> health issues are pooled in the World Association for Buiatrics, founded in 1960. National associations and affiliates also exist.|$|R
25|$|Montejo {{eventually}} {{returned to}} Yucatán and, by recruiting Maya from Campeche and Champoton, built a large Indio-Spanish army and conquered the peninsula. The Spanish crown later issued a land grant that included Chichen Itza and by 1588 {{it was a}} <b>working</b> <b>cattle</b> ranch.|$|E
25|$|Although some ranches {{around the}} Spade {{are no longer}} <b>working</b> <b>cattle</b> ranches, the Spade Ranch {{continues}} to operate as a beef cattle ranch. Richards and Comstock's legacy was carried on by Lawrence Bixby, whose legacy is carried on by his descendants. Historically, the Spade Ranch is an important feature of the landscape of Sheridan County, {{and it continues to}} be one today.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{means of}} transport for the cowboy, even in the modern era, is by horseback. Horses can travel over terrain that vehicles cannot access. Horses, along with mules and burros, also serve as pack animals. The most important horse on the ranch is the everyday working ranch horse that can perform {{a wide variety of}} tasks; horses trained to specialize exclusively in one set of skills such as roping or cutting are very rarely used on ranches. Because the rider often needs to keep one hand free while <b>working</b> <b>cattle,</b> the horse must neck rein and have good cow sense—it must instinctively know how to anticipate and react to cattle.|$|E
25|$|Chaps are {{intended}} to protect the legs of cowboys from contact with daily environmental hazards seen in <b>working</b> with <b>cattle,</b> horses and other livestock. They help to protect riders' legs from scraping on brush, injury from thorns of cacti, sagebrush, mesquite and other thorny vegetation.|$|R
50|$|Bennet {{continued}} <b>working</b> with <b>cattle,</b> {{and around}} 1898 began breeding Hereford stud cattle, {{and he won}} numerous prizes with bulls exhibited in Victoria and South Australia. He also bred Shorthorn bulls.In 1900 was left the Cecilia Creek run by James Allen, a former employee.|$|R
5000|$|The Flying W Ranch was a <b>working</b> {{mountain}} <b>cattle</b> ranch, {{and since}} 1953 a tourism venue {{in the foothills}} of Colorado Springs, Colorado. From May to October, the ranch featured outdoor chuckwagon suppers typical of those served on cattle drives, and western style living history areas.|$|R
25|$|In the Top End, sub-tropical {{areas and}} in arid inland regions cattle are bred on native {{pastures}} on expansive cattle stations. Anna Creek Station in South Australia, Australia is the world's largest <b>working</b> <b>cattle</b> station. The North Australian Pastoral Company Pty Limited (NAPCO) {{is now one}} of Australia's largest beef cattle producers, with a herd of over 180,000 cattle and fourteen cattle stations in Queensland and the Northern Territory. The Australian Agricultural Company (AA Co) manages a cattle herd of more than 585,000 head. Heytesbury Beef Pty Ltd owns and manages over 200,000 head of cattle across eight stations spanning the East Kimberley, Victoria River and Barkly Tablelands regions in Northern Australia. Most cattle from these regions are exported as manufacturing beef or as live animals under 350 kilograms live weight to South-East Asia for fattening in feedlots there.|$|E
25|$|Central to {{the myth}} {{and the reality}} of the West is the American cowboy. His real life was a hard one and {{revolved}} around two annual roundups, spring and fall, the subsequent drives to market, and the time off in the cattle towns spending his hard earned money on food, clothing, gambling, and prostitution. During winter, many cowboys hired themselves out to ranches near the cattle towns, where they repaired and maintained equipment and buildings. For young cowboys and buckaroos, <b>working</b> <b>cattle</b> was not just a job but also a lifestyle, one that was lived in the freedom of the outdoors and, most of the time, on horseback. On a long drive, there was usually one cowboy for each 250 head of cattle. Alcohol was everywhere in the West (outside Mormondom), but on the trail the cowboys were forbidden to drink it. Often, hired cowboys were trained and knowledgeable in their trade such as herding, ranching and protecting cattle. To protect their herd from wild animals, hostile Indians and rustlers, cowboys carried with them their iconic weaponry such as the Bowie knife, lasso, bullwhip, pistols, rifles and shotguns.|$|E

500|$|The {{opening scene}} in the Peruvian jungle was filmed {{on the island of}} Kauai, one of the islands of Hawaii, to where Spielberg would return for Jurassic Park. The [...] "temple" [...] {{location}} is on the Huleia River, on the Kipu Ranch, south from Kaumualii Highway on the east coast, just south of Lihue, the island's main town. Kipu is a <b>working</b> <b>cattle</b> ranch, not generally open to the public. The Peruvian section (but actually filmed in Hawaii) featured live tarantulas of a Mexican species (Brachypelma) on Harrison Ford and Alfred Molina, and are harmless to humans, and in fact of a species which are commonly kept as exotic pets. A fiberglass boulder 22feet (7m) in diameter was made for the scene where Indiana escapes from the temple; Spielberg was so impressed by production designer Norman Reynolds' realization of his idea that he gave the boulder a more prominent role in the film and told Reynolds to let the boulder roll another [...]|$|E
500|$|By the 1890s, {{the dogs}} had {{attracted}} the attention of the Cattle Dog Club of Sydney, a group of men with a recreational interest in the new practice of showing dogs competitively. None were stockmen <b>working</b> <b>cattle</b> on a daily basis, and initially they were interested in a range of working dogs, including the Smithfield. They reportedly adopted the term [...] "Australian Cattle Dog" [...] to refer to the dogs being bred from bloodlines originating from Thomas Hall's [...] "heelers", and prominent members of the group concentrated on breeding these lines. Of these breeders, the Bagust family was the most influential. Robert Kaleski, of Moorebank, a young associate of Harry Bagust, wrote [...] "in 1893 when I got rid of my cross-bred cattle dogs and took up the blues, breeders of the latter had started breeding... to fix the type. I drew up a standard for them on those lines". This first breed standard for the Cattle Dog breed was published, with photographs, by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in 1903.|$|E
500|$|The Rocky Mountain Horse is a horse breed {{developed}} {{in the state of}} Kentucky in the United States. Despite its name, it originated not in the Rocky Mountains, but instead in the Appalachian Mountains. A foundation stallion, brought from the western United States to eastern Kentucky around 1890, began the Rocky Mountain type in the late 19th century. In the mid-20th century, a stallion named Old Tobe, owned by a prominent breeder, was used to develop the modern type; today most Rocky Mountain Horses trace back to this stallion. In 1986, the Rocky Mountain Horse Association was formed and by 2005 has registered over 12,000 horses. The breed is known for its preferred [...] "chocolate" [...] coat color and flaxen mane and tail, the result of the relatively rare silver dapple gene acting on a black coat, seen in much of the population. It also exhibits a four-beat ambling gait known as the [...] "single-foot". Originally developed as a multi-purpose riding, driving and light draft horse, today it is used mainly for trail riding and <b>working</b> <b>cattle.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Airedale {{can be used}} as {{a working}} dog and also as a hunting dog. Airedales exhibit some herding {{characteristics}} as well, and have a propensity to chase animals. They have no problem <b>working</b> with <b>cattle</b> and livestock. However, an Airedale that is not well trained will agitate and annoy the animals.|$|R
50|$|Until now tribal folk {{entrusted}} {{the education}} of their children to mullahs, or tribal elders, who had passed the age of usefulness at hunting or <b>working</b> with <b>cattle.</b> Iranian authorities hope that education will prove a useful preliminary to inducing the tribes to settle, cultivate the land, prosper and pay taxes as other citizens do.|$|R

2500|$|Western saddles have {{significantly}} wider stirrups, {{particularly at the}} tread, to minimize this risk. [...] Sometimes, they are equipped with tapaderos, leather covers over the toe that close each stirrup from the front. [...] A tapadero prevents the rider's boot from slipping through and also prevents brush encountered while <b>working</b> <b>cattle</b> on the open range from poking through the stirrup, injuring or impeding the horse or rider. [...] However, the tapadero is not common in modern times and is not allowed in most show competition.|$|E
2500|$|Western saddles are saddles {{originally}} designed to be used on horses on <b>working</b> <b>cattle</b> ranches in the United States. Used today {{in a wide variety}} of western riding activities, they are the [...] "cowboy saddles" [...] familiar to movie viewers, rodeo fans, and those who have gone on tourist trail rides. The Western saddle has no padding of its own, and must be used with a saddle blanket or pad in order to provide a comfortable fit for the horse. [...] It also has sturdier stirrups and uses a [...] cinch rather than a girth. [...] Its most distinctive feature is the horn on the front of the saddle, originally used to dally a lariat when roping cattle.|$|E
2500|$|The main duty of {{the ranch}} horse in the American West was <b>working</b> <b>cattle.</b> [...] Even after the {{invention}} of the automobile, horses were still irreplaceable for handling livestock on the range. Thus, major Texas cattle ranches, such as the King Ranch, the 6666 (Four Sixes) Ranch, and the Waggoner Ranch {{played a significant role in}} the development of the modern Quarter Horse. The skills needed by cowboys and their horses became the foundation of the rodeo, a contest which began with informal competition between cowboys and expanded to become a major competitive event throughout the west. [...] To this day, the Quarter Horse dominates the sport both in speed events and in competition that emphasizes the handling of live cattle.|$|E
50|$|The sport horse {{division}} includes speed classes such as barrel racing, pole bending and jumping; <b>cattle</b> <b>working</b> classes such as team penning {{and team}} sorting; and trail obstacle event classes. Sport horses are keg shod.|$|R

2500|$|Thereafter, Mrs. Mead, {{considered}} an expert horsewoman, {{was killed in}} an accident while <b>working</b> <b>cattle</b> on leased land in Grand Teton National Park on June 21, 1996. Mead was thrown by her horse, which then collapsed upon her. She was divorced from Peter Bradford Mead, who coincidentally partly bears the same name as her father and grandfather. She lived on the Mead Ranch, officially the 'Lower Bar BC', which prior to its salefor more than $100 millionwas one of the largest pastoral private holdings in Teton County. The Hansens and Meads were particularly known for conservation and stewardship activities on their properties. In December 2001, the ranch had become no longer economically productive and surrendered its [...] lease in Grand Teton Park.|$|E
2500|$|In 1985, Baer began {{investigating}} the gambling industry. He noted that tourists paid a US$5 to US$6 admission {{to tour the}} [...] "Ponderosa Ranch", which was the location for filming some episodes of TV's Bonanza. There was nothing to see but a <b>working</b> <b>cattle</b> ranch, but people enjoyed {{it because of the}} Bonanza connection. Baer decided that tourists would also pay for something dealing with The Beverly Hillbillies. He began using his Jethro Bodine role as a marketing opportunity toward the gambling and hotel industry. Baer obtained the sublicensing rights, including food and beverage rights, to The Beverly Hillbillies from CBS in 1991. His business partner estimates the cost of obtaining the rights and developing the ideas has been US$1 million. Sixty-five Beverly Hillbillies slot machines were built in 1999 and placed in 10 casinos.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{motorized}} vehicle driven in modern ranch {{work is the}} pickup truck. Sturdy and roomy, with a high ground clearance, and often four-wheel drive capability, it has an open box, called a [...] "bed," [...] and can haul supplies from town or over rough trails on the ranch. It is used to pull stock trailers transporting cattle and livestock from one area to another and to market. With a horse trailer attached, it carries horses to distant areas where they may be needed. Motorcycles are sometimes used instead of horses for some tasks, but the most common smaller vehicle is the four-wheeler. It will carry a single cowboy quickly around the ranch for small chores. In areas with heavy snowfall, snowmobiles are also common. However, in spite of modern mechanization, there remain jobs, particularly those involving <b>working</b> <b>cattle</b> in rough terrain or in close quarters that are best performed by cowboys on horseback.|$|E
2500|$|Later, {{the people}} who settled the Americas needed a hardy horse that was capable of <b>working</b> with <b>cattle.</b> [...] Thus, Arabians and Thoroughbreds were crossed on Spanish horses, both domesticated animals descended from those brought over by the Conquistadors, and feral horses such as the Mustangs, descended from the Spanish horse, but adapted by natural {{selection}} to the ecology and climate of the west.
