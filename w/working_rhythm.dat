40|$|Abstract—This paper proposes novel {{quantitative}} methods {{to measure the}} effects of social communications on individual working rhythms by analyzing the communication and code committing records in tens of Open Source Software (OSS) projects. Our methods are based on complex network and timeseries analysis. We define {{the notion of a}} <b>working</b> <b>rhythm</b> as the average time spent on a commit task and we study the correlation between <b>working</b> <b>rhythm</b> and communication frequency. We build communication networks for code developers, and find that the developers with higher social status, represented by the nodes with larger number of outgoing or incoming links, always have faster working rhythms and thus contribute more per unit time to the projects. We also study the dependency between work (committing) and talk (communication) activities, in particular the effect of their interleaving. We introduce multiactivity time-series and quantitative measures based on activity latencies to evaluate this dependency. Comparison of simulated time-series with the real ones suggests that when work and talk activities are in proximity they may accelerate each other in OSS systems. These findings suggest that frequent communication before and after committing activities is essential for effective software development in distributed systems. I...|$|E
40|$|One of the obsessions {{of recent}} labor {{movement}} is organizing the community- base labor movement. The {{study shows that}} labors have a not very lucky social identity in the community they live, in which it differ them from their lords. The identity is formed due to: (1) the social demographic character of the labor, (2) The <b>working</b> <b>rhythm</b> in factories which limits their {{time and energy to}} socialize themselves with their lords. Such unlucky differences are still strengthened by: (1) the regulation of inhabitant administration, (2) labor allocation by industries, and (3) various interventions towards communities. Establishing the community-base labor movement is supposed to consider such realities, in order not to strengthen the differences, but build up understanding among communities...|$|E

Most specifically it draws on the movement and performance practices that I have developed and carried out in conjunction with (as well as beyond) this doctoral project, such as the making and showing of a performative afternoon entitled: body, trees & things (2012). In particular, the present article proposes to configure physical exposure as a relevant practice for contemporary outdoor dance, one that invites and supports working in confederation with the liveliness and agency of materials and atmospheres on site. I have developed four modes of physical exposure that I call transitioning, walking, dwelling and moving-dancing, which I introduce {{in the course of}} this text. I consider these four to be intricately connected and of mutual influence and I move freely between them in my <b>working</b> <b>rhythm</b> of preparing performance work or teaching.

40|$|In this article, we {{investigate}} {{the relations between}} discursive practices within the Danish construction industry and the perceived pain, physical deterioration, and strain affecting the construction workers. Of central importance is the widely accepted hegemonic discourse on physical strain and pain as unavoidable conditions in construction work. Based on 32 semi-structured interviews performed in eight case studies within four different construction professions, workers’ descriptions of physical strain {{and its relation to}} the organizational and social context are analyzed through concepts of subject positioning in discursive practice and a focus on power relations. The analysis shows that workers and employers reproduce certain types of traditional working class masculinities and search for high-pace productive <b>working</b> <b>rhythms,</b> which in combination with economic incentives common within the industry reproduce physical strain and the habituation of pain as unquestioned conditions in construction work. The understanding of this mutual reinforcement of the necessity of physically straining, painful, high-paced construction work provides fruitful perspectives on the overrepresentation of musculoskeletal deterioration within construction work and also sheds light on some of the difficulties in addressing and changing occupational health and safety practices in the construction industry...|$|R

40|$|Much {{research}} into learning emphasises {{the scope of}} the learning experience {{and the nature of the}} learning environment. The issue of collaboration among learners is central to the concepts of learner engagement, authentic learning and cognitive load. While the impetus to deploy advanced technologies to support teaching and learning endeavours has not waned, it is increasingly evident that knowledge age learners must be appropriately supported to ensure that learning gains take place. The application of the Zing Team Learning System (ZTLS) in face-to-face learning appreciably enhances the scope for collaboration and sets the stage for information sharing, co-creation of meaning, problem resolution, creative thinking and decision making. However, the procedural and process dynamics of ZTLS are inherently complex and powerful, and they require skilled facilitation. The key questions stemming from the use of the ZTLS for teaching and learning relate to: (i) social purposes or outcomes; (ii) effective management of the team/group’s <b>working</b> <b>rhythm</b> or flow; and (iii) reconciling individual and collective desires to achieve particular educational outcomes. Ongoing interdisciplinary research at Central Queensland University encompassing action research and activity theory addresses these issues, and reports initial developments that provide insight into the efficacy of the ZTLS as a knowledge creation tool. We argue that a shift in understanding the learning context is required in order to appreciate that the ZTLS clearly secures a working basis for distributed cognition. Moreover, ongoing research seeks to explore how teachers of adult learners can stress the importance of a ‘knowledge-centric’ andragogy as the basis for implementing higher education curricula...|$|E
40|$|Expatriation {{has become}} {{increasingly}} common due to the global trade expansion. Many large companies base their production facilities in far-flung countries, where experts are sent from their own countries to launch the operations. Working in a foreign environment demands from so-called expatriates considerable adaptability. This study aimed to investigate if following expatriation mental health difficulties were experienced by the employees themselves or their family members. This study investigated by a questionnaire and interviews how expatriate employees in Finnish companies operating in different regions of Brazil and their families adjusted. Investigated employees were required {{to be at least}} 6 months in expatriation. Data were collected in Brazil during their stay at least 3 months after the arrival. The survey covered 121 expatriate employees, that operated in 17 different companies, from which 71 employees from 10 different companies responded to the questionnaire. All the employees from the two largest enterprises and their spouses were invited to focus groups; in total 43 persons (22 employees and 21 employees’ spouses) participated in a group or individual interviews. No significant mental health difficulties were found among the expatriate employees. Only a tenth of the expatriate employees reported strain. The experience of strain symptoms was found to be related to long working days, intense <b>working</b> <b>rhythm</b> and lack of friends. Work satisfaction seemed to be an important mediator in the coping process. While abroad, the expatriate employees were highly recognized for their work. Due to the immature organization of work they could often use their creative capacities to improve the work flow. The opportunity to see the effects of their own contribution with their own eyes {{to the development of the}} enterprise made them feel good. The association between the expatriate employees’ adjustment and that of their spouses’ was evident. The spouses’ situation was markedly different than that of the expatriate employees’ themselves. Expatriation changed the family members’ previous division of tasks considerably. The expatriate spouses had to change their roles more than the expatriate employees themselves; since most of them were highly educated women, who were leaded through an identity crisis due to at least temporary renunciation of own work and career...|$|E

40|$|Higher {{education}} is a sector entering an era of IT-enabled modernization in which it may {{have to cope with}} an influx of unfamiliar corporate concepts and practices. This paper analyzes one of the first Enterprise Resource Planning implementation projects within the academic administration of an Ivy League university. We contribute to existing qualitative literature in information systems by developing the theme of temporality within actor–network theory to support our analysis. This enables us to extend process-oriented ERP research by focusing on the identification of temporal zones and creation of durable work times designed to re-order priorities between competing visions for the future of higher education. We analyze detailed negotiations during periods of controversy to reveal how standard work practices come to be created and recreated. We consider how the ERP that emerges is affected by progressive trials of strength during the project and analyze the achievement of order as an on-going process. Our findings highlight the distinctive contribution that a ‘temporal turn’ can bring to longitudinal research studies by providing insight into the technical agency of ERP packages and how its temporal inscriptions shaped the emergence of a socio-technical information system. This reordered organizational work life and created a hybrid temporality that still needs to be negotiated into the <b>working</b> <b>rhythms</b> of the University’s actors...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper offers}} {{an insight into}} the games {{software}} development process from a time perspective by drawing on an in-depth study in a games development organization. The wider market for computer games now exceeds the annual global revenues of cinema. We have, however, only a limited scholarly understanding of how games studios produce games. Games projects require particular attention because their context is unique. Drawing on a case study, the paper offers a theoretical conceptualization of the development process of creative software, such as games software. We found that the process, as constituted by the interactions of developers, oscillates between two modes of practice: routinized and improvised, which sediment and flux the <b>working</b> <b>rhythms</b> in the context. This paper argues that while we may predeterminately lay down the broad stages of creative software development, the activities that constitute each stage, and the transition criteria {{from one to the}} next, may be left to the actors in the moment, to the temporality of the situation as it emerges. If all development activities are predefined, as advocated in various process models, this may leave little room for opportunity and the creative fruits that flow from opportunity, such as enhanced features, aesthetics and learning...|$|R

In Northern regions, where daylight is fleeting in the wintertime, cities have long carried out “daytime” activities in darkness. However, the colonization of the night is occurring in other regions as well. Today, this neglected space-time is very much coveted. More and more, human activities are unfolding during the night, constructing a new domain of work and leisure. Our hyper-modern society, characterized by disruptions to the social division of time, and marked by the individualization of behavior, changes in <b>working</b> <b>rhythms</b> and a new importance accorded to free time, has transcended the barrier of darkness. The nighttime city, as a clarification of the day, reveals the human condition and requires our full attention. The urban night, a long-forgotten dimension of the city, is now a central field of interest for researchers, communities and town councilors. Even better, it has become a space- time of innovation in relation to which town planning and the sustainable city can be rethought.

40|$|Despite the {{popularity}} of agile methods in software development and increasing adoption by organizations there is debate about what agility is {{and how it is}} achieved. The debate suffers from a lack of understanding of agile concepts and how agile software development is practiced. This paper develops a framework for the organization of agile software development that identiÂ¿es enablers and inhibitors of agility and the emergent capabilities of agile teams. The work is grounded in complex adaptive systems (CAS) and draws on three principles of coevolving systems: match coevolutionary change rate, maximize self-organizing, and synchronize exploitation and exploration. These principles are used to study the processes of two software development teams, one a team using eXtreme Programming (XP) and the other a team using a more traditional, waterfall- based development cycle. From the cases a framework for the organization of agile software development is developed. Time pacing, self-management with discipline and routinization of exploration are among the agile enablers found in the cases studies while event pacing, centralized management, and lack of resources allocated to exploration are found to be inhibitors to agility. Emergent capabilities of agile teams that are identiÂ¿ed from the research include coevolution of business value, sustainable <b>working</b> with <b>rhythm,</b> sharing and team learning, and collective mindfulness...|$|R
5000|$|African-American work songs {{originally}} {{developed in the}} era of captivity, between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries. Because they were part of an almost entirely oral culture they had no fixed form and only began to be recorded as the era of slavery came to an end after 1865. Slave Songs of the United States was the first collection of African-American 'slave songs.' It was published in 1867 by William Francis Allen, Charles Pickard Ware, and Lucy McKim Garrison. Though this text included many songs by enslaved people, other texts have also been published that include work songs. Many songs sung by enslaved individuals have their origins in African song traditions, and may have been sung to remind the Africans of home, while others were instituted by the captors to raise morale and keep Africans <b>working</b> in <b>rhythm.</b> They have also been seen as a means of withstanding hardship and expressing anger and frustration through creativity or covert verbal opposition. Similarly, work songs have been used as a form of rebellion and resistance. Specifically, African-American Women Work Songs have a particular history and center around resistance and self-care. Work songs helped to pass down information about the lived experience of enslaved people to their communities and families.|$|R
