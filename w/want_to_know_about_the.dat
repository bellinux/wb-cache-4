25|$|Some {{parents want}} to try to have a baby very soon after the miscarriage. The {{decision}} of trying to become pregnant again can be difficult. Reasons exist that may prompt parents to consider another pregnancy. For older mothers, there may be some sense of urgency. Other parents are optimistic that future pregnancies are likely to be successful. Many are hesitant and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> risk of having another or more miscarriages. Some clinicians recommend that the women have one menstrual cycle before attempting another pregnancy. This is because the date of conception may be hard to determine. Also, the first menstrual cycle after a miscarriage can be much longer or shorter than expected. Parents may be advised to wait even longer if they have experienced late miscarriage, molar pregnancy or are undergoing tests. Some parents wait for six months based upon recommendations from their health care provider.|$|E

The boys are as well curious about the world of stardom and <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> kind of artist who only releases one song, then its all over. They are explained the concept of [...] "one-hit wonders" [...] by their mother, who reminisces about her days as one named [...] "Lindana". While the boys work on becoming one by writing a [...] "meaningless" [...] song in their room, Candace prepares to audition, trying on various outfits to wear to the audition -including her mother's Lindana outfit- all rejected by her friend Stacy.|$|E
2500|$|In 1987, Tottle {{published}} his controversial book as Fraud, Famine, and Fascism: the Ukrainian Genocide Myth from Hitler to Harvard, {{in which he}} asserts that claims the Holodomor was an intentional genocide are [...] "fraudulent", and [...] "a creation of Nazi propagandists". His book, published by Progress Publishers in Toronto, appeared {{around the same time}} Ukrainian Communist party leader Volodymyr Shcherbytsky publicly acknowledged the famine, in December 1987. As a result, the book was subsequently withdrawn from circulation. In a review of Tottle's book in the Ukrainian Canadian Magazine, published by the pro-Communist Association of United Ukrainian Canadians, Wilfred Szczesny wrote: [...] "Members of the general public who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> famine, its extent and causes, and about the motives and techniques of those who would make this tragedy into something other than what it was will find Tottle's work invaluable" [...] (The Ukrainian Canadian, April 1988, p.24). Some of Tottle's material appeared in a 1988 article in the Village Voice, [...] "In Search of a Soviet Holocaust: A 55-Year-Old Famine Feeds the Right".|$|E

When you snatch a peep at them it is like a low parti-coloured stone wall--only the stones are sandbags. The Germans have them black and white, so that you cannot tell which are loopholes and which are black bags. Our people haven't been so clever--and the War Office love of {{uniformity}} has given us only white bags. No doubt it looks neater. But it makes our loopholes plain. For a time black sandbags were refused. The Germans sniped at us, but not very much. Only one of our lot was hit, by a chance shot that came through the sandbag at the top of the parapet. He just had a cut in the neck which didn't prevent his walking back. They shelled the trenches half a mile to the left of us though, and it looked pretty hot. The sandbags flew about. But the men lie low, and it looks worse than it is. The weather was fine and pleasant, as General French always says. And after three days and nights of cramped existence and petty chores, one in the foremost trench and two a little way back, and then two days in support, we came back--and here we are again waiting for our second Go.|$|E
