40|$|Chemotaxis is a {{powerful}} paradigm to study how orientation behavior is driven by sensory stimulation. Drosophila larvae navigate odor gradients by controlling the duration of their runs and the direction of their turns. Straight runs and wide-amplitude turns represent two extremes of a behavioral continuum. Here we establish that, on average, runs curl toward the direction of higher odor concentrations. We find that the orientation and strength of the local odor gradient perpendicular to the direction of motion modulates the orientation of individual runs in a gradual manner. We discuss how this error-correction mechanism, called <b>weathervaning,</b> contributes to larval chemotaxis. We use larvae with genetically modified olfactory systems to demonstrate that unilateral function restricted to a single olfactory sensory neuron is sufficient to direct <b>weathervaning.</b> Our finding that bilateral sensing {{is not necessary to}} control <b>weathervaning</b> highlights the role of temporal sampling. A correlative analysis between sensory inputs and behavioral outputs suggest that <b>weathervaning</b> results from low-amplitude head casts implemented without interruption of the run. In addition, we report the involvement of a sensorimotor memory arising from previous reorientation events. Together, our results indicate that larval chemotaxis combines concurrent orientation strategies that involve complex computations on different timescales...|$|E
40|$|In {{deepwater}} development {{areas of}} Southeast Asia, the current {{is strong and}} relatively more persistent compared to other deepwater regions. Top tensioned risers (TTR) are critical submerged components of offshore platforms, constantly exposed to currents. These currents cause unsteady flow patterns around the risers i. e. vortex shedding. When the vortex shedding frequency is near the riser's natural frequency, undesirable resonant vibration of the riser also known as Vortex Induced Vibration (VIV) occurs. Several types of VIV suppression devices {{are used in the}} offshore industry. Among them, the U-shaped fairing claims to have the capabilities of reducing VIV effectively as well as lowering drag loads. This study investigates the effectiveness of a U-shaped fairing in suppressing riser VIV. The model test was successfully performed in a towing tank facility located at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM), Johor Bahru, Malaysia. This study is a significant collaboration between a local academic institution and the offshore oil and gas industry, aligned with the industry's initiative of increasing local capabilities for research and development. In this study, the VIV of two risers in tandem is simulated using scaled test models. The current flow is simulated by towing the vertically submerged test models with a moving carriage. The riser with fairing models are attached to a pair of custom-designed test rigs which are able to measure the forces and also allow movement of the test model during towing tests. The two test rigs are attached to a steel structure under the carriage which accommodates different tandem riser configurations and spacings. Two different sizes of risers and fairings are tested to check for Reynolds number effects. For each tandem riser configuration, three different riser conditions are tested, i. e. (a) bare risers without fairings; (b) risers with <b>weathervaning</b> fairings, and (c) upstream riser with fairing stuck at different orientations and downstream riser with <b>weathervaning</b> fairing. The test results show significant reduction in drag and VIV for the risers with <b>weathervaning</b> fairings in different tandem configurations. Interesting motion characteristics are shown in some of the stuck fairing cases highlighting the adverse effects should the fairings fail to perform normally in the field. Effective mitigation of VIV in risers using fairing suppression devices could lead to improved riser fatigue life and overall a more economical platform design. These benefits are highly applicable to local deepwater developments for the oil and gas industry...|$|E

40|$|The Southeast Asia metocean {{environment}} {{is characterized by}} moderate wind and waves with relatively strong and persistent currents. The design of a Tension Leg Platform (TLP) for Southeast Asia is strongly affected by the current and resulting drag loads, particularly if many risers are required. To reduce vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) of offshore tubular members i. e. top tension risers (TTRs), vortex suppression devices such as helical strakes and fairings are used. This paper gives an insight into a set of riser VIV model tests which is carried out to study the effectiveness of an open-back "U"-shaped fairing in suppressing riser VIV. The splitting loads and the drag loads of the fairings are also investigated during these tests. The tests are being done at the Marine Technology Center (MTC), Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) {{in support of this}} application, and also in part to increase local technological capabilities. Two sizes of risers are being tested in three configurations: (a) bare riser without any fairings; (b) riser with <b>weathervaning</b> fairings (normal condition) and (c) riser with fairings fixed at different headings (abnormal condition). The test results show that in the normal condition, the fairing is effective at suppressing VIV...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACTAn auto weather-vaning {{system for}} a Dynamic Positioning (DP) vessel is proposed. When a DP vessel is operating, its {{position}} keeping is hindered by ocean environmental disturbances which include the ocean current, wave and wind. Generally, most ocean vessels have a longitudinal length that {{is larger than the}} transverse width. The largest load acts on the DP vessel by ocean disturbances, when the disturbances are incoming in the transverse direction. <b>Weathervaning</b> is the concept of making the heading angle of the DP vessel head toward (or sway from) the disturbance direction. This enables the DP vessel to not only perform marine operations stably and safely, but also to maintain its position with minimum control forces (surge & sway components). To implement auto weather-vaning, a nonlinear controller and a disturbance observer are used. The disturbance observer transforms a real plant to the nominal model without disturbance to enhance the control performance. And the nonlinear controller deals with the kinematic nonlinearity. The auto weather-vaning system is completed by adding a weather-vaning algorithm to disturbance based controller. Numerical simulations of a semi-submersible type vessel were performed for the validation. The results show that the proposed method enables a DP vessel to maintain its position with minimum control force...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Conventional {{design of}} ships and {{offshore}} platforms relies on performing a short-term response analysis for metocean conditions with a 100 -year return period. This approach is efficient {{but not necessarily}} conservative when compared with a comprehensive long-term response analysis that considers platform responses for storms encountered over the lifetime of the platform. Turret-moored floating production, storage and offloading systems are sensitive to non-collinear wind, waves, and current conditions. During hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico such conditions frequently occur and, depending on the resulting <b>weathervaning</b> character-istics of a turret-moored tanker, {{they may have a}} strong impact on vessel motions, mooring line loads, and riser performance. In recent years some very strong hurricanes have occurred in the Gulf of Mexico, e. g. Katrina and Rita in 2005. When including these recent storm data in the long-term response analysis they have a marked effect on the extrapolated 100 -year long-term responses. The post-Katrina long-term responses of a generic turret-moored floating storage and offloading unit are evaluated and compared against pre-Katrina analysis results. The results of the analysis are used to stipulate response-based design criteria which are simple short-term design sea states that can reproduce a given long-term response (e. g. roll) ...|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} model tests in regular seas were {{performed}} on a 1 : 60 scaled model of a generic FPSO. The model was moored by means of four instrumented mooring lines attached to an internal turret. The wavelength to model length ratio was varied from 0. 5 to 2. 0, while {{the ratio of the}} wavelength and the wave amplitude was kept constant as per ITTC seakeeping recommendations. The goal of the tests was to evaluate the response of the hull to swell conditions that may happen in open sea environments and to assess the <b>weathervaning</b> characteristics of the internal turret arrangement. During the tests the six accelerations and six displacements have been measured by means of an inertial and optical system respectively, together with the wave elevation in the basin. From the results, motion response amplitude operators were obtained at different heading conditions. The experimental results for the model displacements were compared with simulations from the well-known diffraction program WAMIT/WADAM. The paper will discuss possible reasons for the yaw instabilities, including the effect of moorings and test duration. The influence of the heading changes on the RAO of the hull with and without constraints will be discussed.

40|$|The task {{is about}} {{observers}} for dynamic positioning of small vessels, including docking and <b>weathervaning.</b> Waves might affect small vessels considerably, {{and the challenge}} is to compensate for these disturbances in the control system. Highfrequency wave motion is commonly filtered out of the measurement because counteracting this motion would be useless, and would only lead to excessive wear and tear. For small vessels however, it is assumed that this motion has to be compensated for by the thrusters and propellers. The main objective is to compare the performance of an observer for dynamic positioning that utilizes a vessel model, with a navigation-type observer that does not utilize a vessel model. In both cases, the observers may utilize position, heading and acceleration measurement. Sub tasks • Implement a nonlinear model based observer, which can utilize position, heading and acceleration measurements to estimate the states. This observer should be able to choose what level of wave filtering should be done, depending on operational mode and weather. • Implement a model-free observer that makes use of the measured acceleration as input to generate estimates. This observer should also be able to choose the level of wave filtering, depending on operational mode and weather. • Compare the above observers in simulations and evaluate the results. Thorough tuning that accounts for the sensors, thrusters and the characteristics of the boat should be carried out...|$|E
40|$|Progress in Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC) {{has come}} {{in fits and starts}} as {{societies}} gained and then lost interest in Renewable Energy. OTEC gained significant political and industrial support after the oil price shocks of the 1970 ’s, but then after funding evaporated in the mid 1980 ’s, work had to be carried on by a smaller group of determined individuals and companies. This paper presents an overview of internal R&D that SBM has carried out on OTEC during 2011 and 2012. OTEC systems have important similarities to our core Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) business and we have been working to understand possible future applications for OTEC in both the Power and Energy Industries. Some of these new applications for OTEC suggest alternative pathways for implementing the pilot plant that is needed to produce a clear multi-year operational record of a scalable OTEC power block. In our 2012 OTEC R&D, we have worked to develop a Cold Water Pipe (CWP) design for a 10 MW plant that can be manufactured, transported, installed, and operated with available technology. Analysis of the 4 -meter diameter fiberglass reinforced plastic CWP shows manageable stress and angle response to the environment. The CWP system includes a sealed gimbal device at the interface of the ship and CWP.

40|$|Green {{water has}} a {{significant}} effect on safety and on structural strength of an FPSO. Green water mostly occurs at the bow of an FPSO because of the <b>weathervaning</b> capability. When the waves, current and wind are not co-directional, it can occur that waves are coming in {{on the side of the}} FPSO. When designing an FPSO for a benign environment, classification society rules are available to determine the measures which have to be considered against green water along the side. When the probability of green water and the freeboard exceedance along the side are actually known, no potentially unnecessary measures, implied by classification society regulations, have to be implemented on the FPSO. This study dealt with the probability of green water occurrence and most probable maximum freeboard exceedance along the side of the Petrojarl 1. Specifically, the effect of the various ship motions and the free surface elevation on the probability of green water are researched. The probability of green water occurring along the side of the Petrojarl 1 is analysed with linear 3 D diffraction theory. The analysis is performed for the conditions in which the vessel will be operating. The probability is based both on the second order Forristall distributionand the linear Rayleigh distribution to determine the effect of the distribution on the probability of green water occurrence, because the Forristall distribution accounts for the second order wave effects in the incoming wave. The free surface elevation along the side of the FPSO under a certain relative wave angle proved to be of great importance. Therefore the free surface elevation is validated with measurements performed at MARIN for the free surface elevation along a plate. Finally, the relative wave angle also affects the probability of green water. This study dealt with the influence of the relative wave angle for the green water probability along the side of the Petrojarl 1.

40|$|Vortex induced {{vibration}} (VIV) {{occurs when}} a body is exposed to a fluid flow that causes an unsteady flow pattern due to vortex shedding {{at or near the}} structure's natural frequency leading to resonant vibrations. This phenomenon frequently happens in slender elements such as risers used in deepwater oil and gas developments. Such vibrations may reduce the fatigue life of the riser, potentially causing catastrophic damage to the integrity of the system and the environment. Installation of VIV suppression devices onto risers will alter the vortex shedding patterns, thus able to mitigate VIV. A model test was carried out to study the effectiveness of a newly developed U-shaped fairing in reducing drag and VIV of risers. The U-shaped fairing is an alternative of conventional spiral strakes and tear-drop-shaped fairings for riser VIV suppression. The model test findings offer useful information for its industrial application in suppressing riser VIV. The model test was performed in a towing tank facility in Malaysia located at Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM). Current flow was simulated by towing a vertically submerged scaled-down riser section underwater with a moving carriage. The riser model was attached to a custom-designed test rig to replicate a section of the actual riser and to simulate its 2 D motions. The model riser was tested in three different conditions, i. e. (a) bare riser without fairing; (b) riser with <b>weathervaning</b> fairing (normal condition) and (c) riser with fairing stuck at different orientations (abnormal condition). The test results show significant reduction of VIV on the model riser with fairing under normal condition. In addition, it is found that the drag load for the riser with fairing is significantly lower compared to that of a bare riser or a typical straked riser. This test marks a significant collaboration between a local research institute and the offshore oil and gas industry, aligned with the initiative of increasing local capabilities. Effective mitigation of VIV of risers using suppression devices could lead to improved riser fatigue life and overall a more economical platform design...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{focuses on}} the weather downtime in the offloading cycle of a generic LNG Floating Storage and Regasification Unit (FSRU). Results from these weather downtime assessments are essential for site concept selection and design of FSRU's, and are also used as input for logistics simulating the total gas supply chain. The FSRU is an unproven concept as none yet exists and so far Shell has not designed one in detail. Therefore, the analytical knowledge of and operational insight in operating limits {{with respect to the}} FSRU side-by-side offloading cycle is not available. This leads to difficulties in determining downtime and its most sensitive factors. Objective The objective of this project is therefore twofold: 9 ̆ 5 To determine the most sensitive operating limit that causes weather downtime 9 ̆ 5 To create a tool that can assess weather downtime of an FSRU The study focused on a near shore import terminal that is <b>weathervaning</b> around a turret and is supplied by LNG Carriers (LNGC's) with a capacity of approximately 135, 000 m 3 and offloading the LNG in a side-by-side mooring configuration. The duration of this offloading cycle is 25 hours. These are general characteristics and figures practical in today's industry. Methodology In order to achieve this goal, three building blocks were designed and implemented: 9 ̆ 5 Operating limits of the typical operations in an offloading cycle of the FSRU 9 ̆ 5 A downtime calculation tool 9 ̆ 5 A model that calculates the heading direction of the FSRU As an FSRU has never been built before, root criteria and operating limits could not be derived from historical data, and thus had to be derived from other (concept) projects, literature, guidelines and operational experience on comparable operations like lightering and conventional LNG operations. The downtime model designed for this study has been based on the Downtime Assessment Tool of DMC: this tool calculates downtime based upon the availability of suitable weather windows to perform an offloading cycle. Fleet logistics or other causes of downtime are not included in the model. The model considers a continuous time trace of hindcast environmental data. An essential component of the downtime tool is the rotation model, which has been designed to calculate the heading direction of the FSRU, resulting in the relative angles of incidence of the environmental forces. This model takes into account the transverse forces and yaw moments based on empirical approximation equations of forces on vessels and LNG Carriers, taken from the guidelines of the Oil Companies International Marine Forum (OCIMF).
