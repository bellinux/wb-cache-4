500|$|The episode's conclusion—in which Will {{declares}} {{that the original}} Rocky Horror fans and New Directions members are united by their outcast status—was widely criticized, with VanDerWerff deeming it a [...] "series lowpoint", and [...] "a muddled, terrible message, particularly in an episode {{that seems to have}} an uneasy relationship with actual outcasts, transsexuals." [...] Both Reiter and Aly Semigran of MTV questioned the resolution, with Reiter stating that it was unclear <b>what</b> <b>message</b> the creators were attempting to convey, and Semigran finding it disjointed, suggesting [...] "The Rocky Horror Glee Show" [...] to be a [...] "rare Glee misstep".|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} book, Gladwell noted that [...] "the biggest {{misconception}} about success {{is that we}} do it solely on our smarts, ambition, hustle and hard work." [...] In Outliers, he hopes to show {{that there are a lot}} more variables involved in an individual's success than society cares to admit, and he wants people to [...] "move away from the notion that everything that happens to a person is up to that person". Gladwell noted that, although there was little that could be done with regard to a person's fate, society can still impact the [...] "man"-affected part of an individual's success. When asked <b>what</b> <b>message</b> he wanted people to take away after reading Outliers, Gladwell responded, [...] "What we do as a community, as a society, for each other, matters as much as what we do for ourselves. It sounds a little trite, but there's a powerful amount of truth in that, I think." ...|$|E

2500|$|After emancipation, Wright’s mother {{moved with}} her son from Dalton to Cuthbert, Georgia. He {{attended}} the Storrs School. The school had a reputation among freedmen as a place for their children to be educated. While visiting the school, retired Union General Oliver Otis Howard asked <b>what</b> <b>message</b> he should take to the North.

2500|$|In November 2005, {{billboards and}} unipolls all over Beirut were {{displaying}} a lady's hand upon a cloudy horizon. No writing {{was on the}} posters.

Soon it was generally concluded that the hand belonged to a recording artist, but there were many conflicting suggestions as to whose it was.

2500|$|The COJ ethics {{hearing was}} held on November 12, 2003. Moore {{repeated}} his earlier sentiment that [...] "to acknowledge God cannot {{be a violation of}} the Canons of Ethics.

[...] He also acknowledged that he would repeat his defiance of the court order if given another opportunity to do so, and that if he returned to office, [...] "I certainly wouldn't leave [...] in a closet, shrouded from the public." [...] In closing arguments, the Assistant Attorney General said Moore's defiance, left unchecked, [...] "undercuts the entire workings of the judicial system... <b>What</b> <b>message</b> does that send to the public, to other litigants? The message it sends is: If you don't like a court order, you don't have to follow it."

2500|$|A cave then {{opens in}} front of the three, and Moses bids Aaron to enter. [...] Moses wishes now to for Aaron to remove the priestly vestments (as God had suggested), but again is at a loss for words. [...] So, one more in an {{elliptical}} manner, Moses requests that Aaron leave the vestments with Eleazar outside the cave because they might otherwise become defiled in the cave (where there may be graves, Moses points out). [...] Aaron thinks it a wise idea, and leaves the vestments with Eleazar outside, but yet remains innocent {{of the nature of the}} circumstances. [...] Entering into the cave, Moses and Aaron see a bed, a set table, and candelabra and a ministering angel. [...] Aaron now inquires <b>what</b> <b>message</b> Moses has from God, and indicates that even if it be about his own death, that he will accept it gratefully. [...] Aaron having broached the subject, Moses now takes the opportunity to inform him that it is indeed the notice of Aaron's death which is the message God means for Moses to convey. [...] Not alarmed at the content of the message, Aaron is nevertheless perturbed that Moses did not tell him of his death in a more forthright manner. [...] However, Moses explains how Aaron's death will be more desirable than his own death, for Aaron is to be buried by his brother, and his honor was to be inherited by his children; dignities which will be denied to Moses himself. [...] (Aaron is appeased by this argument, being evidently oblivious to the pathos therein.) ...|$|E

50|$|Brushfire {{polls are}} used {{for a number of}} purposes. First, it lets the {{candidate}} know if they have made any progress on the ballot, how much progress has been made, and in what demographics they have been making or losing ground. Secondly, it is a way for the campaign to test a variety of messages, both positive and negative, on themselves and their opponent(s). This lets the campaign know <b>what</b> <b>messages</b> work best with certain demographics and <b>what</b> <b>messages</b> should be avoided. Campaigns often use these polls to test possible attack messages that their opponent may use and potential responses to those attacks. The campaign can then spend some time preparing an effective response to any likely attacks. Thirdly, this kind of poll can be used by candidates or political parties to convince primary challengers to drop out of a race and support a stronger candidate.|$|R
