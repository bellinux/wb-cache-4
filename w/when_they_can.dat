5|$|Elephants {{have been}} working animals {{since at least the}} Indus Valley Civilization and {{continue}} to be used in modern times. There were 13,000–16,500 working elephants employed in Asia in 2000. These animals are typically captured from the wild when they are 10–20 years old <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be trained quickly and easily, and will have a longer working life. They were traditionally captured with traps and lassos, but since 1950, tranquillisers have been used.|$|E
5|$|Views on YouTube for Dunne have {{continued}} to grow, with around 4 million YouTube views per month, and with total views of over 175 million. He makes {{the majority of his}} income with sales of his songs and albums on Bandcamp and iTunes, as well as monetisation of his YouTube videos. He has taken an unusual approach to piracy, and has said that he is fine with people pirating his music if they are poor or broke, and encourages them to tell their friends about him, credit him if they use his music, and buy it <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>can.</b>|$|E
50|$|People feel angry <b>when</b> <b>they</b> {{sense that}} they or someone they care about has been offended, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are certain {{about the nature and}} cause of the angering event, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> are certain someone else is responsible, and <b>when</b> <b>they</b> feel <b>they</b> <b>can</b> still {{influence}} the situation or cope with it.|$|R

5|$|As George tells Jerry {{that his}} girlfriend no longer {{wants to see}} him, Jerry tells George that he gave away his ticket to Horneck. Although Jerry offers George his own ticket, George does {{not go to the}} game with Horneck because he does not know Horneck. Jerry decides to give Horneck both tickets, {{claiming}} that he cannot make the game because he is tutoring his nephew. Later, the night of the Knicks game,Jerry is in his apartment talking to his ex-girlfriend Elaine. She jokingly tries to add to Jerry's list of excuses with which he avoids Horneck. He later discovers that Horneck took Kramer to the game and that Horneck is in the building. When Horneck meets Jerry and Elaine, Horneck invites them out to another Knicks game. They come up with more unusual excuses in an attempt to avoid going out. However, Horneck then gets out a newspaper and tries to organize a time <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> all meet, weeks in advance. Jerry realizes that no matter what excuses he comes up with, he cannot avoid Horneck.|$|E
5|$|Born {{helpless}} {{and unable to}} move around (nidicolous and semi-altricial), the chicks are constantly brooded by the parents until they are 3 to 5 days old, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> thermoregulate their body temperature. They grow their first feathers—scapulars—at 13–15 days, followed by primaries at 24–27 days, tail feathers at 30–35 days and are fully feathered by 55 days. They are attended by the parents more between the 30th and 60th days; a behavior possibly related to the greater food requirements of the chicks during those days. Semi-digested food is regurgitated and then fed to younger birds, with older birds being fed solid food. The parents {{can be seen at}} normal rates with the chicks up to about the 70th day, after which the attendance by the parents falls rapidly. Chicks receive no care after fledging, with only about one out of seven chicks receiving food after the 80th day, and almost no chicks are visited after about 90 days. After fledging, the chicks will leave the nest, with few remaining after about 100 days.|$|E
5|$|Social insects, such as termites, ants {{and many}} bees and wasps, {{are the most}} {{familiar}} species of eusocial animal. They live together in large well-organized colonies that may be so tightly integrated and genetically similar that the colonies of some species are sometimes considered superorganisms. It is sometimes argued that the various species of honey bee are the only invertebrates (and indeed {{one of the few}} non-human groups) to have evolved a system of abstract symbolic communication where a behavior is used to represent and convey specific information about something in the environment. In this communication system, called dance language, the angle at which a bee dances represents a direction relative to the sun, and the length of the dance represents the distance to be flown. Though perhaps not as advanced as honey bees, bumblebees also potentially have some social communication behaviors. Bombus terrestris, for example, exhibit a faster learning curve for visiting unfamiliar, yet rewarding flowers, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> see a conspecific foraging on the same species.|$|E
50|$|Leaping {{blennies}} feed primarily off of algae. They are oviparous {{and form}} distinct pairs <b>when</b> mating. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> reach a {{maximum total length}} of 10 centimetres (3.94 inches).|$|R

25|$|In {{psychological}} {{experiments that}} test how workers respond when {{the meaning of}} their task is diminished, the test condition {{is referred to as}} the Sisyphusian condition. The two main conclusions of the experiment are that people work harder <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> imagine meaning in their work, and that people underestimate the relationship between meaning and motivation.|$|E
25|$|Sorceries and instants differ only in <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be cast. Sorceries {{may only}} be cast during the player's own main phase, and only when the stack is empty. Instants, on the other hand, can be cast at any time, {{including}} during other players' turns and while another spell or ability is waiting to resolve (see timing and the stack).|$|E
25|$|In most {{societies}} {{the great}} majority of people eat meat <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> get it, but increasing controversy and debate has arisen over the ethics of eating animals. The most commonly given ethical objection to meat-eating is that, for most people living in the developed world, it is not necessary for survival or health; slaughtering animals solely because people enjoy the taste of meat is argued by some to be wrong and morally unjustifiable.|$|E
50|$|Unlike adults, {{the colour}} of {{immature}} insects {{varies depending on}} their phase. <b>When</b> solitary <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be green or brown; when in large numbers (gregarious), they are bright yellow and red-brown with black markings.|$|R
50|$|Species in {{the genus}} Amphibolurus are {{partially}} arboreal {{and are often}} found perching on trunks and branches. Lizards of this genus are swift and shy, and <b>when</b> disturbed, <b>they</b> <b>can</b> engage in bipedal running.|$|R
5|$|Mole crickets evade predators {{by living}} below ground, and vigorously {{burrowing}} if disturbed at the surface. As a last-ditch defence, they eject a foul-smelling brown liquid from their anal glands <b>when</b> captured; <b>they</b> <b>can</b> also bite.|$|R
25|$|A {{study of}} over 300 births to captive female gorillas {{revealed}} that older females tend {{to give birth}} to more male offspring as opposed to females under 8 years old. This pattern is likely to result from selective pressures on females to have males at a time <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> provision them most effectively, as male reproductive success probably varies more than that of females and depends more on the maternal role.|$|E
25|$|Pedestrians {{must often}} cross {{from one side}} of a road to the other, and in doing so may come into the way of {{vehicles}} traveling on the road. In many places pedestrians are entirely left to look after themselves, that is, they must observe the road and cross <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> see that no traffic will threaten them. Busier cities usually provide pedestrian crossings, which are strips of the road where pedestrians are expected to cross.|$|E
25|$|The models {{also make}} {{assumptions}} about how continuous gusts vary with altitude. The Dryden and von Kármán models {{specified by the}} Department of Defense define three different altitude ranges: low, 10ft to 1000ft AGL; medium/high, 2000ft AGL and above; and in between. The turbulence intensities, turbulence scale lengths, and turbulence axes depend on the altitude. The Department of Defense also provides models for the gust angular velocity but gives criteria based on airplane stability derivatives for <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be omitted.|$|E

5000|$|Although people {{necessarily}} have to cooperate to survive, the way they go about this is highly contradictory, and involves [...] "character masks", because there is also constant competition among individuals, businesses and social classes for money, power and prestige. They all have different interests, {{and are likely to}} take advantage of others, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> sense <b>they</b> <b>can</b> get away with it. This competition is rarely a level playing field.|$|R

She has also supported increased access to firearms for frontline officers, by equipping all front-line police vehicles with lock boxes for firearms, but {{does not support the}} full-time general arming of Police officers.|$|E
25|$|The Rawk {{is a large}} boulder {{donated by}} members of Alpha Phi Omega in 1973 and painted nearly every day by {{students}}, who {{use it as a}} giant message board. Unofficial rules govern the use of the Rawk, and students know not to use foul language and that messages must be left for at least 24 hours before being painted over. Students know <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> begin to paint over the previous message on The Rawk by the two smaller rocks in front of it; one for the date, and one for the time at which the message was painted. The Rawk was originally placed where the Fountain is today, on the hill in front of the Dining Hall.|$|E
