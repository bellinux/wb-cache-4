There was no following applause to greet a departing batsman. The roar dropped to a murmur. Then there <b>was</b> <b>silence.</b> It was all very eerie.|$|E

Sunday 26 October would be a day that the crew of the English Trader would never forget. Between 1 am and 1.30 am, {{the ship was}} {{struggling}} against a strong ebbing tide, which in turn forced her dangerously close to the sandbanks of Hammond Knoll. At around 1.45 am the crew felt a slight jolt followed by a more severe jolt. This flung the ship forward followed by loud grinding, crunching and scraping of metal. Then there <b>was</b> <b>silence.</b> The ship had run aground on Hammond Knoll.|$|E

500|$|At Bayreuth {{performances}} audiences do not applaud {{at the end}} of {{the first}} act. This tradition is the result of a misunderstanding arising from Wagner's desire at the premiere to maintain the serious mood of the opera. After much applause following the first and second acts, Wagner spoke to the audience and said that the cast would take no curtain calls until the end of the performance. This confused the audience, who remained silent {{at the end of}} the opera until Wagner addressed them again, saying that he did not mean that they could not applaud. After the performance Wagner complained, [...] "Now I don't know. Did the audience like it or not?" [...] At subsequent performances some believed that Wagner had wanted no applause until the very end, and there <b>was</b> <b>silence</b> after the first two acts. Eventually it became a Bayreuth tradition that no applause would be heard after the first act, but this was certainly not Wagner's idea. In fact during the first Bayreuth performances Wagner himself cried [...] "Bravo!" [...] as the Flowermaidens made their exit in the second act, only to be hissed by other members of the audience. At some theatres other than Bayreuth, applause and curtain calls are normal practice after every act; at other major theatres, including the Metropolitan Opera in New York, the Bayreuth custom is followed.|$|E

He had a remarkable gift for tipping {{the balance of power}} in his favor." ...|$|E
2500|$|The world largely {{neglected}} {{the violent}} Soviet takeover of Georgia. On 27 March 1921, the exiled Georgian leadership issued an appeal from their temporary offices in Istanbul to [...] "all socialist parties and workers' organizations" [...] of the world, protesting against {{the invasion of}} Georgia. The appeal went unheeded, though. Beyond passionate editorials in some Western newspapers and calls for action from such Georgian sympathizers as Sir Oliver Wardrop, the international response to the events in Georgia <b>was</b> <b>silence.</b>|$|E

2500|$|At Session II, on 26 March, the {{necessary}} legal procedure began. Two cardinal deacons, two bishops, and two notaries approached the church doors, opened them, {{and in a}} loud voice, in the Latin tongue, called upon the rival pontiffs to appear. No one replied. [...] "Has anyone been appointed to represent them?" [...] they added. Again there <b>was</b> <b>silence.</b> The delegates returned to their places and requested that Gregory and Benedict be declared guilty of contumacy. [...] This ceremony was repeated on 27 March, 30 March, 15 April and 24 April. It was announced that on Monday 15 April, the day after Whitsunday, the Council would address the contumacy of Cardinal Antonio de Calvis (Gregorian Obedience), Cardinal Jean Flandrini, Cardinal Lucovico Fieschi, and Cardinal Antoine de Chalant (Benedictine Obedience).|$|E
2500|$|A Parliament {{called to}} meet on 7 October {{repealed}} all the legislation of the Coventry parliament the previous year. On 10 October, York arrived in London and took {{residence in the}} royal palace. Entering Parliament with his sword borne upright before him, he made for the empty throne and placed his hand upon it, as if to occupy it. He may have expected the assembled peers to acclaim him as king, as they had acclaimed Henry Bolingbroke in 1399. Instead, there <b>was</b> <b>silence.</b> Thomas Bourchier, the Archbishop of Canterbury, asked whether he wished to see the king. York replied, [...] "I know of no person in this realm the which oweth not to wait on me, rather than I of him." [...] This high-handed reply did not impress the Lords.|$|E
2500|$|The Seventh Seal (...) is a 1957 Swedish epic {{historical}} fantasy film {{written and}} directed by Ingmar Bergman. Set in Sweden during the Black Death, it tells of the journey of a medieval knight (Max von Sydow) and a game of chess he plays with the personification of Death (Bengt Ekerot), who has come to take his life. Bergman developed the film from his own play Wood Painting. The title refers to a passage [...] from the Book of Revelation, used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, beginning with the words [...] "And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there <b>was</b> <b>silence</b> in heaven about the space of half an hour". Here the motif of silence refers to the [...] "silence of God," [...] which is a major theme of the film.|$|E

2500|$|Lionsgate's {{president}} of theatrical marketing Tim Palen {{thought of the}} idea to make 1,000 posters {{with a small amount}} of Bell's blood, which was mixed with the printing ink. He said, [...] "We decided to do a poster and he's wearing a red cloak. I was talking to the printer and asked what we could do to get the deepest blood red. I asked if it would be possible to use actual blood. There <b>was</b> <b>silence.</b> He said, 'We could try, but are you serious?' I said I was dead serious." [...] The posters were sold for $20, with the first being auctioned off; all the proceeds from the auctioned poster were donated to the Red Cross. [...] Lionsgate also held the third annual [...] "Give Til It Hurts" [...] blood drive for the Red Cross and collected 23,493 pints of blood.|$|E
2500|$|Bede {{tells us}} that Owin was working outside the oratory at Lichfield. Inside, Chad studied alone because the other monks were at worship in the church. Suddenly Owin {{heard the sound of}} joyful singing, coming from heaven, at first to the south-east, but {{gradually}} coming closer until it filled the roof of the oratory itself. Then there <b>was</b> <b>silence</b> for half an hour, followed by the same singing going back the way it had come. Owin at first did nothing, but about an hour later Chad called him in and told him to fetch the seven brothers from the church. Chad gave his final address to the brothers, urging them to keep the monastic discipline they had learnt. Only after this did he tell them that he knew his own death was near, speaking of death as [...] "that friendly guest who is used to visiting the brethren". He asked them to pray, then blessed and dismissed them. The brothers left, sad and downcast.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{influence}} on Woolf was the American writer Henry David Thoreau, with Woolf {{writing in a}} 1917 essay that her aim as a writer was to follow Thoreau by capturing [...] "the moment, to burn always with this hard, gem-like flame" [...] while praising Thoreau for his statement [...] "The millions are awake enough for physical labor, but only one in hundreds of millions is awake enough to a poetic or divine life. To be awake is to be alive". Woolf praised Theoreau for his [...] "simplicity" [...] in finding [...] "a way for settling free the delicate and complicated machinery of the soul". Like Thoreau, Woolf believed that it <b>was</b> <b>silence</b> that set the mind free to really contemplate and understand the world. Both authors believed in a certain transcendental, mystical approach to life and writing, where even banal things could be capable of generating deep emotions if one had enough silence {{and the presence of}} mind to appreciate them. Woolf and Thoreau were both concerned with the difficulty of human relationships in the modern age.|$|E

2500|$|Although REZ {{had been}} left out of the {{mainstream}} success which arguably the band had spearheaded for others, REZ was nevertheless more interested in using its music to speak plainly to both non-Christians about the reality of God and to Christians about their responsibility to the disenfranchised and hurting in the world around them. [...] To that end, REZ returned to the studio in 1988, and the result <b>was</b> <b>Silence</b> Screams, a hybrid of blues, hard rock and heavy metal that served as a musical blueprint for all of the band's successive releases. [...] Sporting unsettling cover art, Silence Screams deals forcefully with social concerns such as abortion, greed, racial profiling and even terrorism, proving that—as they did with confronting apartheid in 1979—the band was once again ahead of the curve. [...] The album is also unique in that it is the first to have been released on the band's own record label, Grrr Records, a wordplay on Myrrh Records, the most successful Contemporary Christian record label at that time. [...] Now, the band could exercise complete creative and financial control over their music.|$|E
2500|$|The title {{refers to}} a passage {{about the end of}} the world from the Book of Revelation, used both at the very start of the film, and again towards the end, {{beginning}} with the words [...] "And when the Lamb had opened the seventh seal, there <b>was</b> <b>silence</b> in heaven about the space of half an hour" [...] (Revelation 8:1). Thus, in the confessional scene the knight states: [...] "Is it so cruelly inconceivable to grasp God with the senses? Why should He hide himself in a mist of half-spoken promises and unseen miracles?...What is going to happen to those of us who want to believe but aren't able to?" [...] Death, impersonating the confessional priest, refuses to reply. Similarly, later, as he eats the strawberries with the family of actors, Antonius Block says: [...] "Faith is a torment – did you know that? It is like loving someone who is out there in the darkness but never appears, no matter how loudly you call." [...] Bragg notes that the concept of the [...] "Silence of God" [...] in the face of evil, or the pleas of believers or would-be-believers, may be influenced by the punishments of silence meted out by Bergman's father, a chaplain in the State Lutheran Church. Interestingly, in Bergman's original radio play sometimes translated as A Painting on Wood, the figure of Death in a Dance of Death is represented not by an actor, but by silence, [...] "mere nothingness, mere absence...terrifying...the void." ...|$|E
