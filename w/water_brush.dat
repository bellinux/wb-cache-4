It faced the open and stood just under the wide-spreading shelf of rock. The tiny outlet from the spring flowed beside it and spilled its clear water over a stone, to fall into a little pool. The floor of this woodland habitation consisted of tips of spruce boughs to about a foot in depth, all laid one way, smooth and springy, and so sweetly odorous that the air seemed intoxicating. Helen and Bo opened their baggage, and what with use of the cold <b>water,</b> <b>brush</b> and comb, and clean blouses, they made themselves feel as comfortable as possible, considering the excruciating aches. Then they {{went out to the}} campfire.|$|E
60|$|The plain fact was, that Mrs. Thorpe was {{secretly}} vain of her child. She had long since, poor woman, forced down the strong strait-waistcoats of prudery and restraint over every other moral weakness but this--of all vanities the most beautiful; {{of all human}} failings surely the most pure! Yes, {{she was proud of}} Zack! The dear, naughty, handsome, church-disturbing, door-kicking, house-flooding Zack! If he had been a plain-featured boy, she could have gone on more sternly with her admonition: but to look coolly on his handsome face, made ugly by dirt, tears, and rumpled hair; to speak to him in that state, while soap, <b>water,</b> <b>brush</b> and towel, were all within reach, was more than the mother (or the woman either, for that matter) had the self-denial to do! So, before it had well begun, the maternal lecture ended impotently in the wash-hand basin.|$|E

50|$|Dandy {{brush or}} Hard-bristled brush: A stiff-bristled brush {{is used to}} remove the dirt, hair and other {{material}} stirred up by the curry. Brushes {{are used in the}} direction of the horses hair coat growth, usually in short strokes from front to back, except at the flanks, where the hair grows in a different pattern. The best quality dandy brushes are made of stiff natural bristles such as rice stems, though they wear out quickly. Plastic-bristled dandy brushes are more common. Dandy brushes can usually be used on the legs, but many horses object to a stiff brush being used on the head. Some dandy brushes do double duty as a <b>Water</b> <b>Brush,</b> when moistened in water and used to wet down the hair coat, mane or tail. Such use may include creating quarter marks for show.|$|E
5000|$|Finally in 1881 the Board {{reported}} [...] "The sea {{has been}} encroaching on this tower until its base {{is in the}} <b>water.</b> <b>Brush</b> mattresses were made, pinned down to the sand with small iron screw piles, covered with sand and occasionally blocks of concrete, to further check such encroachment, but the almost constant surf, beating against the mattresses, tore them to pieces. An appropriation for a new tower, further inland is badly needed. It is recommended that a skeleton iron tower be erected; then if the sea again encroaches, it could be taken down and re erected. The new tower will cost $25,000." [...] The following year the Board noted [...] "No appropriation was made; the site remained unprotected and on July 3, 1882, the tower was overthrown and completely destroyed." [...] The Board strongly recommended that the tower be replaced on a safe site at an early date, there being no intervening light between San Blas and Pensacola, Florida, 120 miles (190 km or 220 km) distant.|$|E

40|$|Wall‐climbing robots have {{extensive}} applications, however, no effective adhesion {{system has been}} designed for robots deployed in high‐altitude, rough concrete buildings that are subjected to large wind loads and vibrations. This paper proposes a new suction method based on a mechanism utilizing hook‐like claws and presents {{the design of a}} robot system for inspecting rough concrete walls. We present a method for describing the degree of concrete surface roughness. To study the stress imposed on the hook‐ like claws, we propose two types of mechanical models for the interactions between sharp claws and microprotuberances. The design method for the tips of the sharp claws is then established. Finally, an 8 ‐foot wall‐climbing robot based on a mechanism utilizing hook‐like claws is designed and laboratory experiments on a man‐made concrete wall are conducted. The results indicate that the low‐cost system endows the robot with enhanced climbing stability and satisfies the inspection requirements for tower constructed by <b>water</b> <b>brush</b> stone or bricks...|$|E
40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the prevalence of early childhood caries (ECC) and severe early childhood caries (s-ECC) in inner-city children in Ghent, Belgium, and to investigate the independent impact of its determinants. Method and Materials: In a non-randomized cross-sectional research design, all children between 24 and 34 months of age attending the final consultation at a participating Child and Family Health Clinic were included (n = 385). Data on oral hygiene and caries were collected by oral examination. Caries prevalence and oral hygiene were determined according to established criteria. Data on oral health habits and socioeconomic status were obtained by a validated questionnaire. All analyses were performed with ECC and s-ECC as response variables. Results: The mean DMFS was 0. 83 (SEM = 0. 14). ECC was diagnosed in 18. 5 % {{of the children and}} s-ECC was found in 12. 2 %. Treatment need was 100 %. From the multiple regression analysis it became clear that ethnicity and neighborhood significantly determined ECC. From all oral health-related behavioral variables, only daily use of a bottle with sweetened drinks other than milk or water, frequency of brushing, and quality of oral hygiene as expressed by Plaque Index scores remained significantly associated with ECC. Conclusion: Children whose mothers had an Eastern European nationality at birth and who live in a deprived neighborhood, daily use a bottle with sweetened drinks other than milk or <b>water,</b> <b>brush</b> less than once a day, and have plaque are at higher risk for ECC and s-ECC...|$|E

When leather is mechanically cleaned with a soft steam of <b>water,</b> soft <b>brushed</b> and sponges can also be used. In the case of consistent impurities, leather can be cleaned by chemical means, with the use of small amounts of non-ionic detergents. The chemical cleaning must be followed with a rinse under a stream of water.|$|R

30|$|Twice daily toothbrushing using {{toothpaste}} {{that contains}} fluoride {{in the range}} of 1000 – 1500  ppmF is a most important preventive measure.

40|$|AIM: To {{assess the}} effect of protein-containing toothpastes on the {{progression}} of dental erosion in situ (with pellicle) and in vitro (without pellicle). METHODS: A combined split-mouth (extraoral <b>water</b> or toothpaste <b>brushing)</b> and crossover (type of toothpaste) setup was used. Two protein-containing (high/low concentrations of colostrum) and one nonprotein (placebo) toothpaste were investigated. Sixteen volunteers wore intraoral appliances containing 2 human enamel samples on 3 afternoons for pellicle growth during 90 min. One enamel sample was brushed for 5 s {{with one of the}} three toothpastes and subsequently exposed to a slurry of the corresponding toothpaste for 2 min. The other sample was exposed to water. Both samples were subsequently exposed to citric acid (extraorally). Loss of calcium and inorganic phosphate were determined. The same sequence of exposures was applied to 16 enamel samples in an in vitro setup without pellicle. RESULTS: With the in situ-formed pellicle, all toothpastes significantly reduced calcium loss compared to <b>water</b> <b>brushing,</b> although {{no significant differences were found}} among toothpastes (p = 0. 073). For the loss of phosphate, a significant reduction could be found with the use of the high-protein toothpaste compared to the nonprotein toothpaste. Overall there were only slight differences between the toothpastes. Toothpaste effects were less clear in the in vitro experiment. CONCLUSION: The addition of proteins to toothpaste shows some promise for the prevention of erosion. Further research is needed to investigate the performance of the protein-containing toothpastes in longer in situ studies with regard to erosive wear...|$|R
