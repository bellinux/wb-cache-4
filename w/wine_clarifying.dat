All wine samples were treated by concentrations of 10, 20 and 40 g/hL of finings. The main aim was to discover how the particular agents in different dosages influence the TAC. The second part describes relations between changes in TAC in content of single antioxidant components (total polyphenols, anthocyanins, gallic acid and simple phenols). Total antioxidant capacity in red wine samples was evaluated using the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay (TEAC). A theoretical part of the thesis briefly summarizes basics about luminescence, focused on chemiluminescent reaction. Theory of free radicals and antioxidants, especially those included in red wine are also described. Process of winemaking aimed at fining is also contained in this part. An experimental part describes techniques of determination of the total antioxidant capacity, principle of chemiluminescent assay based on the luminol/peroxidase system.

50|$|A {{byproduct}} of the energy created during fermentation is heat which raises {{the temperature of the}} fermenting must as the yeast work. When temperatures near 104°F (40°C), activity slows and yeast start to die. If temperatures stay high and the yeast stop reproducing then the fermentation is at grave risk of getting stuck. Even if the must is cooled back down, fermentation will be very difficult to restart due to a chemical compound released by the dying yeast that serves as an inhibitor to the growth of future yeast cells in the batch. Modern winemaking equipment includes temperature control mechanisms such as stainless steel fermenting tanks with a cooling jacket to help regulate temperatures. Another potential cause is a combination of lack of oxygen and yeast nutrients found in the lipids suspended in grape solids. In the absence of oxygen, yeast will seek out the lipids in grape solid as a source of nutrients to sustain its activity. If the wine is lacking grape solids (such as if the <b>wine's</b> been <b>clarified)</b> then the yeast are at risk of starving and causing the fermentation to get stuck. This risk is lower for red wines which are often fermented with their skins in open air containers or oak wine barrels which provide plenty of oxygen and grape solids for the yeast to feed on.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1976 The {{development}} of whey beverages including whey wine {{has been an}} area of whey utilization research.

It included developing a process to clarify the naturally cloudy wine, monitoring the physical and chemical changes which occurred during the wine making process, comparing the sensory differences in the unclarified and <b>clarified</b> <b>wine,</b> and incorporating the wine sediment in a food product. The criteria for the clarification process were simplicity, legality, reasonable cost, minimal usage of energy and equipment, and maintenance of the wine character and quality. Existing procedures for <b>clarifying</b> grape <b>wine</b> such as filtration, centrifugation, {{and the addition of}} fining agents, casein, Cold Mix Sparkolloid, gelatin, tannin, and bentonite were investigated. Also investigated were techniques used to separate the proteins from whey; specifically pH adjustment (with potassium carbonate) and precipitation (with sodium hexametaphosphate). It was found that the most feasible clarification procedure was the addition of 0. 20 - 0. 50 percent bentonite on a dry weight basis followed by a polishing filtration. Determinations for lactose, protein, fat, ash, and total solids and tests for Brix, pH, titratable acidity, and alcohol content were performed to monitor the effects of fermentation, aging, and clarification. The changes noted during fermentation and aging were primarily due to alcoholic and lactic acid fermentations. Bentonite fining had a dilution effect but did increase the ash content of the wine. Triangular difference tests with blindfolded tasters indicated that there was no significant taste difference between cloudy wine and bentonite-fined and filtered wine. A cursory gas-liquid chromatographic analysis revealed only a slight difference in the gross volatile components of unclarified and <b>clarified</b> <b>wines.</b> The wine sediment was dried to a paste and substituted at the five and ten percent levels for nonfat dry milk in a commercial sugar cookie recipe.

40|$|Copyright © 2008 Australian Society of Viticulture and Oenology Inc. Field {{tests to}} {{evaluate}} in-line dosing with bentonite followed by centrifugation {{as an alternative}} to batch fining for protein haze control in white wine or juice were undertaken. The tests were performed at a commercial winery with a Sultana wine and Gordo (Muscat of Alexandria) juice and using two types of bentonite: Vitiben and SIHA-Active-Bentonite G. Fining performance was monitored by heat testing and quantification of heat unstable protein by HPLC. Heat test turbidity and heat unstable protein concentration decreased to stable values between 30 s and 2 min after bentonite injection. Sensory evaluation of Sultana wine fined with Vitiben by balanced reference duo-trio difference tests detected no difference between untreated, in-line dosed, and batch fined wine. Furthermore the volume of wine or juice occluded in lees can be substantially reduced by centrifugal compaction. However, incomplete separation of bentonite from wine or juice during centrifugation produced a carryover of 30 % of the added bentonite into the <b>clarified</b> <b>wine.</b> This carryover problem may be mitigated, inter alia, by reducing operating flowrate through the centrifuge or using multiple centrifugation steps (in parallel or series). Therefore, in-line dosing followed by centrifugation provides a rapid processing method for protein haze reduction in wine or juice with a decreased volume of lees. It can reduce significant value losses presently arising in the wine industry from batch fining and the resulting quality downgrades that occur in wine recovered from bentonite lees by rotary drum vacuum filtration.
