Third-row seating, a cargo barrier, and preinstalled wiring to accommodate mobile phone usage were made available as options for the station wagon variants. Additionally, all models were fitted with an advanced <b>window</b> <b>film</b> known as Smart Tint, which claimed to provide equivalent protection levels of SPF15 sunscreen. For improved vehicle refinement, thicker glass was installed to lessen wind noise and a further insulation was added in the dashboard to produce a quieter ride.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the most {{successful}} ceramics tint in the market was made using Titanium Nitride(TiN). During the same period, Japanese <b>window</b> <b>films</b> manufacturers figured that Antimony Tin Oxide(ATO) could be added to <b>window</b> <b>films</b> to achieve higher visible light transmission(VLT) at lower cost, as compared to TiN, given the same heat reduction. However, the early ATO films production technology was relatively unstable {{and it was only}} until 1999, that production breakthrough was truly achieved for ATO films. During the early 2000s, most of the Japanese Antimony Tin Oxide films were procured by FilmTack's associated companies in Singapore.|$|R

5000|$|Daylight Redirecting <b>Window</b> <b>Film</b> (DRF) {{applied to}} windows is {{relatively}} new alternative to Light shelves. DRF {{is applied to the}} upper section of a window (clerestory or daylighting position). The principle method of light redirection is by Total Internal Reflection (TIR) of light transmitted through the microscopic elements of the film. When sunlight or skylight penetrates the film, internal microscopic [...] "louvers" [...] redirect the incoming light upward to the ceiling, where the typical ceiling redistributes the diffuse daylight deeper into the space. As <b>window</b> <b>film</b> does not alter the architectural nature of the building, Daylight Redirecting Film is an elegant and easy upgrade.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{functional}} <b>window</b> <b>films</b> {{have gained}} much interest. These <b>windows</b> <b>films</b> {{can be used}} {{for a wide variety of}} applications. Some common examples of these applications are UV blocking, window tinting, insulation and shatter resistance. Most of the <b>window</b> <b>films</b> are functionalized by thin layers on a flexible substrate. It is also known that these thin layers are not stable in air and prone to deterioration caused by moisture and abrasion. This drawback can be overcome by the deposition of an additional scratch resistant coating. In this research, a protective silica coating with an increased mechanical strength and flexibility is deposited on a Polyethyleneterephtalate (PET) film. The latter is also functionalized with a thin metal oxide layer through sputtering and is often used for functional <b>window</b> <b>films.</b> Incorporation of hybrid organic-inorganic species inside the silica precursor, results in an increase of mechanical strength and, simultaneously, an increased flexibility and durability of the silica coating. The precursor solution was deposited onto the substrate by reverse gravure roll-coating. The ratio between web speed and application speed was optimized to obtain sufficient wetting of the film. A temperature program for inline drying of the coating is set up. The temperature program is important to transfer the results to industrial setups where the time available for drying is limited. One must keep in mind that the temperature should be high enough to obtain complete drying of the precursor solution while it should be low enough to avoid melting or breakdown of the organic substrate...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Window</b> <b>films</b> are generically {{categorised}} {{by their}} construction components (dyed, pigmented, metallized, ceramic or nano), by their intended use (automotive, marine or architectural), by substrate type (glass or polycarbonate), and/or by their technical performance (privacy, solar control, safety and security).|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} about the {{developing}} parameters and relationships for selecting a proper glass <b>window</b> applied with <b>film</b> as building envelopes for buildings located in a hot climate based on its thermal performances. Thermal comfort of the occupants sitting near the glass window is the thermal performance {{that needed to be}} considered besides the heat transmission in selecting a proper type of glass to use as a glass window for the building. The predicted percentage of dissatisfied (PPD) is chosen as a thermal comfort index. 45 types of film and 1280 glass <b>windows</b> with <b>film</b> are investigated in this study. It can be shown that the thermal comfort index is dependent on the optical properties (total transmittance and total absorptance) and the overall heat transfer coefficient of glass <b>windows</b> with <b>film.</b> Glass <b>window</b> with <b>film</b> which has high transmittance shall have more discomfort due to solar radiation effect. Glass <b>window</b> with <b>film</b> which has high absorptance shall have more discomfort due to surface temperature effect. The discomfort from the surface temperature effect for double pane glass <b>window</b> with <b>film</b> is also dependent on the glass thickness other than the absorptance and the change in overall heat transfer coefficient. Expressions for predicting the performance of the glass <b>windows</b> with <b>film</b> in terms of thermal comfort are developed...|$|R

5000|$|Heat {{rejection}} {{films are}} normally {{applied to the}} interior of flat glass windows {{to reduce the amount}} of infrared, visible light, and ultraviolet (UV) radiation entering windows. Such films are usually dyed or metalized (which can be transparent to visible light) to convert incoming solar radiation to infrared radiation, which is then rejected back through the glass to the exterior. Modern <b>window</b> <b>film</b> technology has created ceramic window films which are non-metallic and do not contain dyes that can result in discoloration. The ceramic and metallic window films usually cost 10-15 percent more than regular <b>window</b> <b>film</b> but can reduce energy transmission by as much as 80 percent. [...] Ceramic window films cost slightly more but provide a substantial increase in blocking UV rays and ability to control heat transfer.|$|E
