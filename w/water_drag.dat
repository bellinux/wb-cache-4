5|$|Hill raced at open {{competitions}} and Top Fuel {{events from}} 1955 until {{he retired in}} 1966. After opening a motorcycle shop, he returned several years later to race motorcycles. He started racing drag boats after attending a drag boat event in 1974 and he won championships {{in all of the}} major boat drag racing sanctioning bodies. Hill set the lowest wet elapsed time (e.t.) record with a 5.16-second run, which was lower than the land drag racing record of 5.39seconds. He quit <b>water</b> <b>drag</b> racing after he suffered broken bones at a crash in Arizona and returned to land drag racing in 1985. Initially underfunded and unsuccessful, Hill set the all-time speed record at a National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) event in 1987, becoming the first person to hold both the land and water speed records simultaneously. In 1993, Hill became the NHRA's oldest Top Fuel champion. When Hill retired in 1999, he had won 12national season point championships on land or water, and had won more than 100trophies in motorcycles and 86drag events between his land and water careers.|$|E
500|$|Hill raced an {{all white}} blown-fuel {{hydroplane}} from 1978 to 1984. He won 55 of 103 races during that time. Hill captured four American Drag Boat Association (ADBA) championships {{and was the}} SDBA top points earner in five consecutive years. In 1982, his Top Fuel hydroplane went [...] at an NDBA event to set the world's record for a quarter mile <b>water</b> <b>drag</b> at Chowchilla, California. It was recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records, {{and it was not}} broken for 10years. Hill also set speed records that year in the SDBA (220.76mph), ADBA (215.82mph), and International Hot Boat Association (IHBA) (212.78mph). He became the only racer to hold records in all four associations simultaneously. [...] He won the NDBA Nationals four times including three straight from 1982 until 1984. In 1983 and 1984, Hill won the World Series of Drag Boat Racing championship. The series features two races {{in each of the four}} major drag boat racing sanctioning bodies. He won 17 races between 1983 and 1984, and made 29 of 34final rounds. [...] Before he quit boat drag racing, he had an elapsed time of 5.16seconds in the wet quarter mile at Firebird Lake in Chandler, Arizona. The e.t. was quicker than Gary Beck's 5.39-second NHRA Top Fuel dragster record, the first time that the water record was lower than the land record. Hill quit boat racing in October 1984 after a crash at 217miles per hour. [...] "It was a perfect run," [...] Hill recalled. [...] "I started to settle the boat back into the water, and then it took off." [...] His Texas A ring was torn off his hand; he suffered seven broken bones, a concussion, & eye injuries. He spent five days in the hospital and was not fully recovered for a year.|$|E

6000|$|There {{was no more}} to be said or done, {{except to}} hunt for another fly in the trout fly-book. Here {{there was no such}} thing, but a local spectator offered me a huge fly, more like a gaff, and {{equipped}} with a large iron eye for attaching the gut to. Withal I suspect this weapon was meant, not for fair fishing, but for [...] "sniggling." [...] Now [...] "sniggling" [...] is a form of cold-blooded poaching. In the open water, on the Ettrick, you may see half a dozen snigglers busy. They all wear high wading trousers; they are all armed with stiff salmon-rods and huge flies. They push the line and the top joints of the rod deep into the <b>water,</b> <b>drag</b> it along, and then bring the hook out with a jerk. Often it sticks in the side of a salmon, and in this most unfair and unsportsmanlike way the free sport of honest people is ruined, and fish are diminished in number. Now, the big fly may have been an honest character, but he was sadly like a rake- hook in disguise. He did not look as if an fish could fancy him. I, therefore, sent a messenger across the river to beg, buy, or borrow a fly at [...] "The Nest." [...] But this pretty cottage is no longer the home of the famous angling club, which has gone a mile or two up the water and builded for itself a new dwelling. My messenger came back with one small fatigued-looking fly, a Popham, I think, which had been lent by some one at a farmhouse. The water was so heavy that the small fly seemed useless; however, we fastened it on as a dropper, using the sniggler as the trail fly; so exhausted were our resources, that I had to cut a piece of gut off a minnow tackle and attach the small fly to that. The tiny gut loop of the fly was dreadfully frayed, and with a heavy heart I began fishing again. My friend on the opposite side called out that big fish were rising in the bend of the stream, so thither I went, stumbling over rocks, and casting with much difficulty, as the high overgrown banks permit no backward sweep of the line. You are obliged to cast by a kind of forward thrust of the arms, a knack not to be acquired in a moment. I splashed away awkwardly, but at last managed to make a straight, clean cast. There was a slight pull, such as a trout gives in mid-stream under water. I raised the point, and again the reel sang aloud and gleefully as the salmon rushed down the stream farther and faster than the first. It is a very pleasant thing to hook a salmon when you are all alone, as I was then--alone with yourself and the Goddess of Fishing. This salmon, just like the other, now came back, and instantly began the old tactics of heavy plunging tugs. But I knew the gut was sound this time, and as I fancied he had risen to the sniggler, I had no anxiety about the tackle holding. One more plunge, and back came the line as before. He was off. One could have sat down and gnawed the reel. What had gone wrong? Why, the brute had taken the old fly from the farmhouse and had snapped the loop that attaches the gut. The little loop was still on the fragment of minnow tackle which fastened it to the cast.|$|E

While the other five were being taken to shore by the helicopter, the tail section of the wrecked Boeing 737 shifted and sank further into the <b>water,</b> <b>dragging</b> Williams under the water with it.|$|R

5000|$|Barracuda skin: Barracuda have {{hundreds}} of skin conduits which force the fluid flows to follow the parallel tubes and become laminar. Again, this arrangement decreases <b>water</b> <b>drag.</b>|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s Speedo added {{elastane}} {{to their}} swimsuits that improved their elasticity, durability and reduced <b>water</b> <b>drag</b> - 21 out of 22 records at the 1972 Olympics were broken using nylon/elastane suits.|$|E
50|$|All {{or almost}} all of the useful energy {{produced}} by the engine is usually dissipated as friction; so minimising frictional losses is very important in many vehicles. The main sources of friction are rolling friction and fluid drag (air drag or <b>water</b> <b>drag).</b>|$|E
50|$|Swim briefs {{are worn}} by {{professional}} and recreational athletes in many water sports. They are {{the standard for}} competitive diving and water polo. They are preferred in competitive swimming for {{the reduction of the}} <b>water's</b> <b>drag</b> on the swimmer, although jammers and bodyskins are sometimes worn instead of the swim brief. Participants in sports that require a wetsuit such as waterskiing, scuba diving, surfing, and wakeboarding often wear swim briefs as an undergarment to the wetsuit.|$|R
5000|$|After those wars, the {{settlement}} of Nickajack Town eclipsed the neighboring town of Running <b>Water</b> (<b>Dragging</b> Canoe's seat of operations) as the dominant town in the immediate area, due to its position on the river near the crossing of the [...] "Federal Road" [...] running from Athens to Nashville over the Tennessee River. One of the town's more prominent residents, Turtle-at-Home (Dragging Canoe's brother), owned the ferry at that crossing and had other commercial interests. In addition, Turtle-at-Home was on the council of the Lower Towns and served as Speaker of the Cherokee National Council.|$|R
50|$|Wake is the {{interaction}} between the ship and the water with its own velocity relative to the ship. The wake has three parts: the velocity of the water around the hull; the boundary layer between the <b>water</b> <b>dragged</b> by the hull and the surrounding flow; and the waves created by the movement of the ship. The first two parts will reduce the velocity of water into the propeller, the third will either increase or decrease the velocity depending on whether the waves create a crest or trough at the propeller.|$|R
5000|$|Designed {{to operate}} in a no-wake zone, the SeaBubble rises after a few meters and reaches a speed of 6 to 8 kn, on four skids. This reduces <b>water</b> <b>drag</b> by 40% and {{increases}} efficiency, [...] allowing speeds of up to a potential 25 kn.|$|E
5000|$|The {{history of}} {{competitive}} swimwear {{has been dominated}} by concerns over public nudity {{in the first half of}} the 20th century and by efforts to reduce <b>water</b> <b>drag</b> in the second half.

5000|$|... a canard-style type-2 with a {{mid-size}} horizontal wing {{near the}} nose of the craft directing airflow under the Main Lift Airfoil. This Type-2 tandem design is a major improvement during takeoff as it creates an air cushion to lift the craft above the water at a lower speed, thereby reducing <b>water</b> <b>drag</b> which is the biggest obstacle to successful seaplane launches.|$|E

50|$|The Tyrrhenian and Ionian meet in Straits of Messina {{generating}} powerful {{currents and}} strong turbulence, aggravated by the abrupt changes of sea bottom topography {{in the vicinity}} of the town of Messina. As a consequence many species, known as rare in the Mediterranean are found in large numbers in the straits. It is common to find deep species at the surface and vice versa, or open-sea species along the coast. The upwelling <b>water</b> <b>drags</b> abyssal species to the surface and sometimes strands them on the shore. Made famous in the nineteenth ceturyby the zoologists Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay and Anton Dohrn the straits have an extraordinary abundance and structure of planktonic, benthic and nektonic communities.|$|R
50|$|Two bow and two stern {{thrusters}} provide port manoeuvrability, and {{two pairs}} of stabilizer fins reduce rolling. A special silicone-based paint, instead of biocides used by much of the industry, keeps barnacles off of the hull. This increases her efficiency by reducing drag while also protecting the ocean from biocides that may leak. The paint is credited with lowering the <b>water</b> <b>drag</b> enough to save 1,200 tonnes of fuel per year. The ship has a bulbous bow, a standard feature for cargo ships.|$|E
50|$|For non-conservative forces, the {{mechanical}} energy that is lost (not conserved) {{has to go}} somewhere else, by conservation of energy. Usually the energy is turned into heat, for example the heat generated by friction. In addition to heat, friction also often produces some sound energy. The <b>water</b> <b>drag</b> on a moving boat converts the boat's mechanical energy into not only heat and sound energy, but also wave energy {{at the edges of}} its wake. These and other energy losses are irreversible because of the second law of thermodynamics.|$|E
50|$|The Tornado {{typically}} flies {{one of its}} two hulls; {{the crew}} balancing the boat with their own weight and by controlling the sails. With only one hull in the <b>water,</b> <b>drag</b> is significantly reduced. The Tornado also features an adjustable, rotating mast, which not only greatly improves the aerodynamics of the crucial {{leading edge of the}} sail, but also allows improved control over mast bend and thus mainsail flatness. For the high speeds and apparent wind directions seen by this high speed vessel, a flat sail profile is often required.|$|E
60|$|But Rames {{would not}} leave go, for in his brave little heart he thought {{that if he did}} the {{crocodile}} would follow Tua and eat her. So he clung to the handle till it was wrenched from him. Indeed he did more, for seeing that the crocodile had bitten the wooden blade in two and, having dropped it, was still advancing towards the slope where it was accustomed to be fed, he leapt into the water and struck it in the eye with his little fist. Feeling the pain of the blow the monster snapped at him, and catching him by the hand began to sink back into deep <b>water,</b> <b>dragging</b> the lad after it.|$|R
5|$|The Berkshire No. 7 was {{constructed}} in 1935 by Jacobson and Peterson, Inc. in Brooklyn, New York, for Stewart J. Dailey, a former mule driver on the Erie Canal who later became {{a partner in a}} Tonawanda, New York, shipbuilding company and afterwards opened his own business, S. J. Dailey Company. The barge was used to ferry materials, including shipping fertilizer from Connecticut to Long Island Sound between 1941 and 1972. Afterwards it was moored in Bridgeport Harbor together with the Elmer S. Dailey and Priscilla Dailey, two other barges. In the spring of 1974, one of the barges began to take on <b>water,</b> <b>dragging</b> down the other two. No part of the Berkshire No. 7 is visible above water.|$|R

5000|$|The {{history of}} {{competitive}} swimwear {{has been dominated}} by concerns over public nudity {{in the first half of}} the 20th century and by efforts to reduce <b>water</b> <b>drag</b> in the second half. Those efforts initially lead swimmers to reduce the early sagging one-piece swimsuits down to briefs only. With the development of new materials that tightly fit the body and offered lower resistance to water than human skin, this trend was reversed to a complete body coverage from heels to neck and wrists. FINA banned full-body suits from competition effective from 1 January 2010, stating that it [...] "wishes to recall the main and core principle is that swimming is a sport essentially based on the physical performance of the athlete".|$|E
50|$|Drag is {{the other}} major concern {{identified}} in articles on neutral buoyancy simulation. Any motion in the water is subject to drag and requires {{a little more time}} (seconds) and a little more force (ounces) to compensate for drag compared to the same motion in EVA. Early in the history of neutral buoyancy simulation there was consideration of providing the immersed astronaut with small motors to compensate for <b>water</b> <b>drag,</b> but this was soon dismissed as an unnecessary complication. Only a small percentage of time is spent in translating to a new location, usually at low velocity, generally less than 6 inches per second. Even such low velocities are subject to drag but it becomes difficult to measure amid the minor currents in the water caused by other astronauts, divers and the water circulation system that add to or subtract from drag.|$|E
50|$|Garrett {{describes}} the Beta Theorem {{as the result}} of the net effect of two counteracting foils, the sail in the air and the keel in the water. When one resolves the ratio of lift to drag for each in its medium, the resulting motion of the sailing vessel resolves to an angle, beta (β), between the apparent wind and the course over the water. The hull (below the <b>water)</b> <b>drag</b> angle and sailing rig (above the water) each have drag angle with respect to the medium flowing past them (water or air). The sum of those two drag angles are equal to the apparent wind angle (the angle between the apparent wind and the course sailed). This theorem applies for every point of sail. A small β denotes high efficiency and a potential for high speed.|$|E
