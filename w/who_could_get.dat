5|$|With Charlton {{approaching}} his 30th birthday, he {{was called}} up by Alf Ramsey to play for England against Scotland at Wembley on 10 April 1965. The game ended 2–2 despite England being forced to end the game with nine men after picking up two injuries; he assisted his brother Bobby for England's first goal. Ramsey later said that he picked Charlton to play alongside Bobby Moore as he was a conservative player able to provide cover to the more skilful Moore, <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> caught out if he made a rare mistake. The defence remained relatively constant in the build up to the 1966 FIFA World Cup: Gordon Banks (goalkeeper), Ray Wilson (left-back), Charlton and Moore (centre-backs), and George Cohen (right-back). After playing in a 1–0 win over Hungary the following month, Charlton joined England for a tour of Europe as they drew 1–1 with Yugoslavia and beat West Germany 1–0 and Sweden 2–1. He played in a 0–0 draw with Wales and a 2–1 win over Northern Ireland to help England win the British Home Championship, though sandwiched between these two games was a 3–2 defeat to Austria – the first of only two occasions {{he was on the}} losing side in an England shirt. He played all nine England games in 1965, the final one being a 2–0 win over Spain at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.|$|E

Those who could not received coal free.

25|$|After 23:00, {{a smaller}} {{group of the}} demonstrators tried {{to get into the}} Magyar Televízió public {{television}} building at Szabadság Tér (Liberty Square) to announce their demands on air. After they were not allowed to enter, a smaller group attacked the police forces. The riot police units which were intended to secure the building and the perimeter were ordered to disperse the crowd with tear gas and a water cannon. They blocked the main entrances but were unable to stop the attackers <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> inside the building. Some demonstrators became indignant at the authorities' resistance and were later joined by a group of enraged football ultras. A hardcore subgroup of them started to make repeated assaults in order to penetrate the defences and break into the building. The police retaliated, using tear gas and a water cannon. The crowd became enraged and attacked the police units by throwing cobblestones and debris (injuring 141 police officers), but they didn't attack the two drivers of the water cannon mobil. They also set several parked cars ablaze (which led to part of the building catching fire too) and eventually managed to enter the building, forcing the police back.|$|E

25|$|From the outset, West Germany did {{not accept}} the {{legitimacy}} of the East German state, and for many years regarded the East German government as an illegal organisation intent on depriving Germans of their constitutional rights. It had not been freely or fairly elected, and the creation of East Germany itself was a fait accompli by the East German Communists and their Soviet allies. This had important consequences for the inner German border. West Germany regarded German citizenship and rights as unitary, applying equally to East and West German citizens alike. An East German who escaped or was released to the West automatically entered into full enjoyment of those rights, including West German citizenship and social benefits. A would-be immigrant from another country <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> to East Germany could not be barred from entering West Germany across the internal border, which had great significance in later decades. West German laws were deemed to be applicable in the East; violations of human rights in East Germany could be prosecuted in the West. East Germans thus had a powerful incentive to move to the West, where they would enjoy greater freedom and economic prospects.|$|E
25|$|Ronnie Burnet was Yorkshire's new {{captain in}} 1958. Not an {{accomplished}} player, {{though he had}} previously captained the club's Second XI, {{he was a good}} man manager and a firm disciplinarian <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> the best out of what was to be a new team in which Trueman was, apart from Brian Close and Vic Wilson, the most experienced player. Burnet made his mark in 1958 with the sacking of Wardle for disciplinary reasons. Yorkshire finished 11th in the County Championship after losing 24 full days to the weather. Regular team members now included Burnet, Close, Trueman, Illingworth, Vic Wilson, Padgett, Ken Taylor, Stott, Jimmy Binks, Brian Bolus, Phil Sharpe and Don Wilson which meant that the great Yorkshire team of the 1960s was taking shape. Trueman played in 30 first-class matches in 1958, taking 106 wickets at a very low 13.33 with best figures of 6–23, one of six 5-wicket hauls. He held 22 catches in the season and it was about this time that he began to prove himself a more reliable batsman, eventually being able to rise from number 11 to about 8 or 9 in batting orders. He scored 453 runs in 1958 with 3 half-centuries and a highest score of 61.|$|E
25|$|Mbeki {{was finally}} given {{permission}} {{to undergo a}} year of military training at the Lenin International School in Moscow. He arrived in Moscow in February 1969 and became {{a student at the}} Lenin Institute, which was established exclusively for communists, the exception being non-communist members of liberation movements <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> ideological training at the Institute. Mbeki excelled at the Institute and regularly addressed the Institutes' weekly assembly. While in Moscow, he continued writing articles, documents and speeches for the ANC and its organs. In June 1969, Mbeki was chosen to be secretary of a high-level SACP delegation to the International Conference of Communist and Workers Parties in Moscow. In June 1970, Mbeki was secretly shuttled from his military camp north-west of Moscow to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) guest house in Volynskoye, where the South African Communist Party's (SACP's) Central Committee was holding its meeting. This was indeed significant because, up to this point, the SACP leadership had been largely non-African. Mbeki and several Africans were now included in the committee, including Chris Hani. Both Hani and Mbeki celebrated their 28th birthdays at this meeting, making them the youngest members to ever serve on the committee. While in Moscow, Mbeki was trained in advanced guerrilla warfare at Skhodnya, and although he was more comfortable with a book rather than a gun, the training was considered a necessary requirement if he was to be accepted as a leader. His military training was cut short as he was sent back to London to prepare for a new post in Lusaka. Throughout Mbeki's training, he kept in constant contact with Zanele.|$|E

The composer Edgar Bainton said of him, [...] "Whatever opinions may be held upon Stanford's music, and they are many and various, it is, I think, always recognised that he was a master of means. Everything he turned his hand to always 'comes off. On the day of Stanford's death, one former pupil, Gustav Holst, said to another, Herbert Howells, [...] "The one man <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> any one of us out of a technical mess is now gone from us." ...|$|E
500|$|The Celtics {{eventually}} {{added two}} talented forwards, future Hall-of-Famer Frank Ramsey and defensive specialist Jim Loscutoff. Along with Celtics colleague Bob Brannum, Loscutoff also became Cousy's unofficial bodyguard, retaliating against opposing players who {{would try to}} hurt him. The Celtics were unable to make their mark in the 1954 NBA Playoffs, 1955 NBA Playoffs, and 1956 NBA Playoffs, where they lost {{three times in a}} row against the Nationals. Cousy attributed the shortcomings to fatigue, stating: [...] "We would get tired in the end and could not get the ball". As a result, Auerbach sought a defensive center <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> easy rebounds, initiate fast breaks and close out games.|$|E
500|$|With {{his victory}} in the 1952 {{president}}ial race, Dwight Eisenhower became the first Republican president in 20 years. The Republican party also held {{a majority in the}} House of Representatives and the Senate. After being elected president, Eisenhower made it clear to those close to him that he did not approve of McCarthy and he worked actively to diminish his power and influence. Still, he never directly confronted McCarthy or criticized him by name in any speech, thus perhaps prolonging McCarthy's power by giving the impression that even the President was afraid to criticize him directly. Oshinsky disputes this, stating that [...] "Eisenhower was known as a harmonizer, a man <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> diverse factions to work toward a common goal.... Leadership, he explained, meant patience and conciliation, not 'hitting people over the head.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Like many musicians of his generation, Holst {{came under}} Wagner's spell. He had recoiled {{from the music}} of Götterdämmerung when he heard it at Covent Garden in 1892, but {{encouraged}} by his friend and fellow-student Fritz Hart he persevered and quickly became an ardent Wagnerite. Wagner supplanted Sullivan as the main influence on his music, and for some time, as Imogen put it, [...] "ill-assimilated wisps of Tristan inserted themselves on nearly every page of his own songs and overtures." [...] Stanford admired some of Wagner's works, and had in his earlier years been influenced by him, but Holst's sub-Wagnerian compositions met with his disapprobation: [...] "It won't do, me boy; it won't do". Holst respected Stanford, describing him to a fellow-pupil, Herbert Howells, as [...] "the one man <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> {{any one of us}} out of a technical mess", but he found that his fellow students, rather than the faculty members, had the greater influence on his development.|$|E

[...] In {{a letter to the}} newspaper, Paul Thornquist described him as [...] "one of the few truly radical and essential artists of the century... was an audacious symbol of man's quest for liberty and freedom." [...] People magazine described him as [...] "the Goddess of Gross, the Punk Elephant, the Big Bad Mama of the Midnight Movies... a Miss Piggy for the blissfully depraved." [...] Following his death, fans of Divine visited Prospect Hill Cemetery to pay their respects. In what has become a tradition, fans have been known to leave makeup, food, and graffiti on his grave in memoriam; Waters claims that some fans have sexual intercourse on his grave, which he believes Divine would love.|$|E

Dewey, Vandenberg and Taft had large public headquarters, but Willkie's campaign was run from clandestine rooms at the Benjamin Franklin Hotel. Root's Willkie Clubs and other supporters bombarded the delegates with telegrams urging support for their candidate, to the annoyance of some. Key convention officials were Willkie supporters; these included House Minority Leader Joe Martin, Massachusetts' favorite son and permanent chairman of the convention. When the head of the Committee on Arrangements, Ralph Williams (deemed likely to support Taft) died just before the convention, he was succeeded by the vice chairman, Sam Pryor, a firm Willkie backer.

500|$|Although Stanton did {{not know}} who murdered Archie, she guessed {{that it could be}} Stacey Slater (which turned out to be correct). Speaking of this, she said that Sophie {{was one of the few}} to {{correctly}} guess it was Stacey. [...] "I had an epiphany about a week before the live episode. It was a memory of the whole Who Shot Phil? storyline, and how there were eight different suspects, including some really hard blokes, and it turned out to be Lisa. I knew DCI Marsden wasn’t going to get the culprit, because of a couple of scenes of the following episode we’d shot in December, and I thought that narratively, Stacey was the only person who the audience would forgive, and <b>who</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> away with it. That was my theory and it turned out to be right!" [...] Naomi Mcelroy from The Sunday Mirror thought that Marsden could be Archie's killer. Marsden left on 22 February 2010, and returned on 5 January 2012. She returned after Phil is framed for Kevin Wicks' (Phil Daniels)'s death and that of a homeless man, who died accidentally in a car-lot fire (part of an insurance scam). According to Inside Soap the police would begin questioning Phil's former fiancée Stella Crawford's death, teasing Marsden's return: [...] "The investigation is set to bring Phil face to face with his old nemisis, DCI Marsden – and this time she'll stop at nothing to put the bad boy permanently behind bars". Digital Spy reported that Marsden re-opens the investigation into Stella's death, [...] "suspecting that all is not what it seems". Finally, Marsden returned for two single episodes on 17 August 2012.|$|E
