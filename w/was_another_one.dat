5|$|An ossuary and a {{mausoleum}} were erected on {{the site}} of the massacre in 1955, as was a monument by the sculptor Vojin Bakić. In 1991, amid inter-ethnic violence during the Croatian War of Independence, the monument and the mausoleum were destroyed by Croatian nationalists, as <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> of Bakić's works, Bjelovarac (The Man From Bjelovar). The ruins of the ossuary were removed by the local authorities in 2002. That same year, residents signed a petition to have the Bjelovarac monument erected once again. The restored monument was unveiled in December 2010.|$|E

The Queen Consort, unlike her father-in-law, who had oppressed Christians, invited different missionaries to enter Joseon.

Unlike the Isolationists, she saw no threat to the Confucian morals of Korean society in the advent of Christianity. Religious tolerance <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> of her goals.|$|E

OIC secretary-general Ekmeleddin Ihsanoglu said prior to the meeting that one main agenda item was stopping Israel from continuing its excavation at the Western Wall near the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest site. The OIC also discussed how it might send peacekeeping troops to Muslim states, as well as the possibility of a change in the name of the body and its charter.

25|$|After World War I, the New York City Subway {{experienced}} {{a surge in}} ridership. By 1920, 1.3 billion annual passengers were riding the subway, compared to 523 million annual riders just seven years before the war. In 1919, the New York Public Service Commission launched a study {{at the behest of}} engineer Daniel L. Turner to determine what improvements were needed in the city's public transport system. Turner's final paper, titled Proposed Comprehensive Rapid Transit System, was a massive plan calling for new routes under almost every north-south Manhattan avenue, extensions to lines in Brooklyn and Queens, and several crossings of the Narrows to Staten Island. Massively scaled-down versions of some of Turner's plans were found in proposals for the new city-owned Independent Subway System (IND). Among the plans was a massive trunk line under Second Avenue consisting of at least six tracks and numerous branches throughout Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Turner also proposed that the two elevated lines be knocked down {{to make room for the}} 6-track Second Avenue Subway. The plan was to connect the new line to the then-unbuilt Sixth Avenue and Eighth Avenue subway lines. A proposal for a Third Avenue subway was also put forth, as <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> for a First Avenue Subway. However, in the initial version of the plan, an East Side subway was not prioritized as part of the IND's construction, regardless of whether it was under First, Second, or Third Avenues.|$|E

500|$|Crash was genetically {{engineered}} {{through the use}} of Cortex and Doctor Nitrus Brio's Evolvo-Ray. Before escaping from Doctor Neo Cortex's island fortress, Crash became romantically attached to a female bandicoot named Tawna, who <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> of Cortex's experiments. Crash's separation from Tawna at the hands of Cortex serves as the primary root of Crash's antagonisation of Cortex. Crash is a very emotional character who is quick to laugh and quick to cry. While he has a danger-loving, fearless nature and loves a good fight, he prefers relaxing in the sun and rarely seeks out trouble deliberately. Crash has an extremely limited vocabulary, preferring to speak in unintelligible gibberish; the few English words he is capable of speaking include [...] "Whoa!" [...] (which he often exclaims upon being physically harmed), [...] "Nina" [...] and [...] "pancakes". To the ire of his friend Crunch, but the amusement of his sister Coco, Crash is prone to impolite personal habits such as belching or scratching his posterior.|$|E
500|$|Guitarist and {{sometimes}} bassist Bill Pitman factored prominently {{in much of}} the Wrecking Crew's work. [...] For a brief time in the late 1950s he provided guitar lessons for a young Phil Spector, before Spector formed the Teddy Bears, who went on to record the surprise hit [...] "To Know Him Is to Love Him" [...] in 1958. [...] Pitman ended up playing on Spector-produced records in the 1960s such as [...] "Be My Baby" [...] by the Ronettes. [...] He can be heard on numerous hits from the period such as [...] "The Little Old Lady (from Pasadena)" [...] by Jan & Dean, and [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] by the Byrds. [...] Tommy Tedesco, born in an Italian family in Niagara Falls, New York, <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> of the Wrecking Crew's most renowned guitarists, playing along with Pitman on [...] "Be My Baby" [...] and [...] "The Little Old Lady (from Pasadena)", {{as well as on the}} Champs [...] "Limbo Rock". [...] He provided the flamenco-influenced guitar licks in the 5th Dimension's [...] "Up and Away" [...] as well as the guitar intro to the popular M*A*S*H theme. [...] Billy Strange was one of the top guitarists with the Wrecking Crew and played on hits such as [...] "The Little Old Lady (from Pasadena)" [...] and the Beach Boys' version of [...] "Sloop John B". [...] Guitarist Bill Aken divided his time between L.A. and Nashville, playing for Pappy Daily of Musicor Records for such artists as George Jones. [...] Like Mike Melvoin, Aken was also classically trained at Juilliard. [...] In addition to playing sessions in Memphis, guitarist James Burton often recorded with the Wrecking Crew in Los Angeles in the 1960s.|$|E

2500|$|A tutor {{and later}} {{teacher at the}} Saint Sava School in Bucharest during the 1830s, he rose suspicions for his {{involvement}} in political conspiracies and was ultimately banned from Wallachia. Vaillant advocated the unification of the Danubian Principalities and other Romanian-inhabited areas, an ideal he notably expressed in his 1844 work La Roumanie. Credited with having publicized the Romanian cause in his native country during the 1850s, and with having introduced the modern references to [...] "Romania" [...] in international discourse, he briefly returned to Bucharest and was naturalized by the new Romanian state in 1864. The state of the Roma community <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> of Vaillant's interests, {{and the practice of}} Roma slavery led him to express support for abolitionist goals.|$|E
2500|$|Among {{the reasons}} for the delayed {{recognition}} of Reinhardt in the U.S. was because until recently the guitar was not considered a jazz instrument, unlike the piano or horn. Recording artist David Grisman states that there was a [...] "prejudice against anything that's different in jazz, and playing jazz on stringed instruments is just too different." [...] Reinhardt's five-piece band initially played only strings, with three guitarists, a violinist and a bass player. Guitarist Mike Peters notes that [...] "the word 'genius' is bantered about too much. But in jazz, Louis Armstrong was a genius, Duke Ellington <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>one,</b> and Reinhardt was also." [...] Grisman adds, [...] "As far as I'm concerned, no one since has come anywhere close to Django Reinhardt as an improviser or technician." ...|$|E

Lead singer Bruce Dickinson in an interview stated [...] "I have a fondness for hymns.

2500|$|The term [...] "foo" [...] was {{borrowed}} from Bill Holman's Smokey Stover by a radar operator in the 415th Night Fighter Squadron, Donald J. Meiers, who (it is agreed by most 415th members) gave the foo fighters their name. Meiers was from Chicago {{and was an}} avid reader of Bill Holman's strip, which was run daily in the Chicago Tribune. Smokey Stover's catch-phrase was [...] "where there's foo, there's fire". In a mission debriefing on the evening November 27, 1944, Fritz Ringwald, the unit's S-2 Intelligence Officer, stated that Meiers and Ed Schleuter had sighted a red ball of fire that appeared to chase them {{through a variety of}} high-speed maneuvers. Fritz said that Meiers was extremely agitated and had a copy of the comic strip tucked in his back pocket. He pulled it out and slammed it down on Fritz's desk and said [...] "... it <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> of those fuckin' foo fighters!" [...] and stormed out of the debriefing room.|$|E

[...] Eventually Figg broke out on his own, and formed Figg Engineering Group, where he was finally able to focus on his true passion, bridges (Wilson 2000). [...] “’Gene was very creative,’ said Jack Mowell, a longtime friend and {{member of the board of}} directors for Figg Engineering Group. [...] ‘He felt bridges should be works of art, not just rivets and steel.’” (Ensley 2002) [...] A man of great drive and ambition, Figg dabbled at golf and was an avid Florida State University sports fan. [...] Often working 14–16 hours a day, even on weekends, he left little time for anything else. [...] One thing Figg did find time for, however, <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> of his passions, his family.

2500|$|When Barrington had {{his second}} heart attack Ann quickly called the team {{physiotherapist}} Bernard Thomas {{from the next}} room and ran downstairs for help while he tried to resuscitate Ken. She found Alan Smith in the crowded lobby and they called for a doctor and an ambulance, {{but by the time}} they arrived Barrington was already dead. They tried to keep the death a secret until his son Guy could be told at his boarding school, but his body had to be sent to the mortuary via the lobby and the news soon leaked. The England captain Ian Botham was told and he and Smith informed each member of the team in the morning. They had a minute's silence at the team meeting before returning to the Kensington Oval, where Barrington had made his maiden Test century 21 years before. The news was announced at the ground and there <b>was</b> <b>another</b> <b>one</b> minute's silence at the beginning of play.

2500|$|In late 1986, Faith No More {{was signed}} to Los Angeles label Slash Records by Anna Statman. The label had {{recently}} been sold to the Warner Music Group subsidiary London Records, ensuring a widespread release for the band's following albums. Introduce Yourself was released in 1987, and a revamped version of their debut album's title track [...] "We Care a Lot" [...] saw minor success on MTV. Mosley's behaviour had started to become increasingly erratic, particularly during a troubled tour of Europe in 1988. Incidents include him allegedly punching Billy Gould on stage, the release party for the album Introduce Yourself — during which he fell asleep on stage — and one of Mosley's roadies getting into a fist fight with guitarist Jim Martin during the European tour. Mosley was eventually fired after the band returned home from Europe. Billy Gould reflected [...] "There was a certain point when I went to rehearsal, and Chuck wanted to do all acoustic guitar songs. It was just so far off the mark. The upshot was that I got up, walked out and quit the band. I Just said: ‘I’m done – I can’t take this any longer. It’s just so ridiculous’.
