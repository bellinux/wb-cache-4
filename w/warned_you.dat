Are you seriously claiming no one <b>warned</b> <b>you</b> it was dangerous?... I mean, have you had a look at the world lately?... There's plenty of stuff going on that kills you and you don't get warned at all. So sticking your head in a crocodile you were told about is not calculated to get my sympathy.|$|E
500|$|The Season 2 episode [...] "Los Moscos" [...] has Management urge Ben to seek Scudder; Ben {{needs to}} learn {{the name of the}} preacher of his dreams (Brother Justin) to prevent a future catastrophe. An induced vision {{transports}} Ben into a desert where he suddenly hears an alarm-like noise. A massive explosion occurs, followed by a rising mushroom cloud. When Ben opens his eyes from the blast of dust, Justin kneels {{in front of him and}} asks [...] "Ye offspring of serpents, who <b>warned</b> <b>you</b> to flee from the wrath to come?" [...] Ben drives past this location one episode later in [...] "Alamogordo, NM". In a shared vision in the episode [...] "Creed, OK", Ben and Sofie kiss in a desert, surrounded by bright light and swirling dust. Season 2 takes place in 1935.|$|E
500|$|The songs discuss {{dysfunctional}} {{intimate relationships}} and sexual deviancy, and feature themes {{of pleasure and}} guilt. They are narrated {{from the perspective of}} a broken sinner and [...] with sinister and narcissistic tones. Dulli's lyrics incorporate haunting refrains and express angst and melodrama. His baritone vocals are moaningly husky and feature falsetto wails. Daniel Fidler of Spin compares Dulli's vocals on the album to those of [...] "a young Paul Westerberg [...]" [...] David Sprague of the Trouser Press calls Congregation a [...] "strangely flamboyant" [...] album that showcases [...] "Dulli's metamorphosis from everypunk wallflower to rakish scoundrel with a [...]" [...] Jason Ankeny of AllMusic calls Dulli [...] "a truly magnetic presence" [...] and writes of his performance on the album, [...] "by turns predator ('Tonight') and prey ('I'm Her Slave'), he's the guy your parents always <b>warned</b> <b>you</b> about, delivering each syllable of his remarkable lyrics with equal measures of innuendo and venom." [...] Stephanie Benson of Rhapsody comments that his lyrics are [...] "full of stifling dissatisfaction and boozy philosophy".|$|E

[...] "And let me <b>warn</b> <b>you,</b> sir, let me <b>warn</b> <b>you,</b> that you are laying {{yourself}} liable to contempt by such insolence.

"We have solemnly <b>warned</b> <b>you,</b> {{and that}} in the most {{determined}} manner, that if you do not cease that course of wanton abuse of the citizens of this county, that vengeance would overtake you sooner or later, and that when it did come it would be as furious as the mountain torrent, and as terrible as the beating tempest; but you have affected to despise our warnings, and pass them off with a sneer, or a grin, or a threat, and pursued your former course; and vengeance sleepeth not, neither does it slumber; and unless you heed us this time, and attend to our request, it will overtake you at an hour when you do not expect, and at a day when you do not look for it; and for you there shall be no escape; for there is but one decree for you, which is depart, depart, or a more fatal calamity shall befall you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Leibowitz called local black {{professionals}} {{as witnesses}} {{to show they}} were qualified for jury service. Leibowitz called John Sanford, an African-American of Scottsboro, who was educated, well-spoken, and respected. The defense attorney showed that [...] "Mr. Sanford" [...] was evidently qualified in all manner except {{by virtue of his}} race to be a candidate for participation in a jury. During the following cross examination, Knight addressed the witness by his first name, [...] "John." [...] The first two times that he did so, Leibowitz asked the court to have him alter his behavior. He did not, and this insult eventually caused Leibowitz to leap to his feet saying, [...] "Now listen, Mr. Attorney-General, I've <b>warned</b> <b>you</b> twice about your treatment of my witness. For the last time now, stand back, take your finger out of his eye, and call him mister," [...] causing gasps from the public seated in the gallery. The judge abruptly interrupted Leibowitz.|$|E

2500|$|Kobolds bring {{good luck}} and help their hosts {{as long as the}} hosts take care of them. The kobold Heinzelmann found things that had been lost. He had a rhyme he liked to sing: [...] "If thou here wilt let me stay, / Good luck shalt thou have alway; / But if hence thou wilt me chase, / Luck will ne'er come near the place." [...] Three famous kobolds, King Goldemar, Heinzelmann, and Hödekin, all gave {{warnings}} about danger to the owners of the home in which they lived. Heinzelmann once warned a colonel to be careful on his daily hunt. The man ignored the advice, only to have his gun backfire and shoot off his thumb. Heinzelman appeared to him and said, [...] "See, now, you have got what I <b>warned</b> <b>you</b> of! If you had refrained from shooting this time, this mischance would not have befallen you." [...] The kobold Hödekin, who lived with the bishop of Hildesheim in the 12th century, once warned the bishop of a murder. When the bishop acted on the information, he was able to take over the murderer's lands and add them to his bishopric.|$|E
2500|$|They {{then head}} to the nearby village to look for Alverez' family. The gate to town is locked, but in return for freeing his soul, Horace opens it. They then {{encounter}} a broken bridge, but, impressed with Torque's efforts to kill him, Hermes helps them cross. As they near the village, however, they are separated by a fire, and Alverez goes on alone, telling Torque {{to get to the}} docks. As he arrives, he encounters Killjoy, who tells him to cure himself he must face what awaits him, and only by using the Rebirth Machine can he defeat it. Torque heads to the docks where he encounters a massive creature with a miniature version of himself protruding from its stomach. Torque fights and defeats the creature, finally remembering what happened to his family; they were murdered by two hitmen, one of whom told Torque [...] "the Colonel sends his regards. Back in Eastern, he <b>warned</b> <b>you,</b> but you didn't listen. He said to leave you alive. Only you. Enjoy your new life." [...] Torque heads to the docks and is picked up by the coastguard. On the boat, the captain recognizes him, and reveals that his case has been reopened after the prosecutor was indicted, and Torque will likely have a retrial. The game ends with the boat sailing away from Carnate.|$|E
2500|$|Eugene {{crossed the}} Alps with some 30,000 men in May/June 1701. After {{a series of}} {{brilliant}} manoeuvres the Imperial commander defeated Catinat at the Battle of Carpi on 9 July. [...] "I have <b>warned</b> <b>you</b> that {{you are dealing with}} an enterprising young prince," [...] wrote Louis XIV to his commander, [...] "he does not tie himself down to the rules of war." [...] On 1 September Eugene defeated Catinat's successor, Marshal Villeroi, at the Battle of Chiari, in a clash as destructive as any in the Italian theatre. But as so often throughout his career the Prince faced war on two fronts—the enemy in the field and the government in Vienna. Starved of supplies, money and men, Eugene was forced into unconventional means against the vastly superior enemy. During a daring raid on Cremona on the night of 31 January/1 February 1702 Eugene captured the French commander-in-chief. Yet the coup was less successful than hoped: Cremona remained in French hands, and the Duke of Vendôme, whose talents far exceeded Villeroi's, became the theatre's new commander. Villeroi's capture caused a sensation in Europe, and had a galvanising effect on English public opinion. [...] "The surprise at Cremona," [...] wrote the diarist John Evelyn, [...] "… was the greate discourse of this weeke"; but appeals for succour from Vienna remained unheeded, forcing Eugene to seek battle and gain a 'lucky hitt'. The resulting Battle of Luzzara on 15 August proved inconclusive. Although Eugene's forces inflicted double the number of casualties on the French the battle settled little except to deter Vendôme trying an all-out assault on Imperial forces that year, enabling Eugene to hold on south of the Alps. With his army rotting away, and personally grieving for his long standing friend Prince Commercy who had died at Luzzara, Eugene returned to Vienna in January 1703.|$|E
