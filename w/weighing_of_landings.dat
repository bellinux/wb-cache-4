40|$|Small pelagic fishes are {{particularly}} abundant {{in areas with}} high environmental variability (zones of coastal upwelling and areas of tidal mixing and river discharge), and because of this, their abundance suffers large inter-annual and inter-decadal fluctuations. In Portugal, the most important species in terms <b>of</b> <b>landings</b> are European sardine, Atlantic horse mackerel and Atlantic chub mackerel. Small pelagic fish landings account for 62. 8 % of the total fish biomass and represent 32. 7 % of the economical value of all catches. We have investigated trends in <b>landings</b> <b>of</b> these small pelagic fishes and detected the effects of environmental factors in this fishery. In order to explain the variability <b>of</b> <b>landings</b> <b>of</b> small pelagic fishes, we have used official landings (1965 - 2012) for trawling and purse seine fisheries and applied generalized linear models, using the North Atlantic Oscillation index (NAO) (annual and winter NAO index), sea surface temperature (SST), wind data (strength and North-South and East-West wind components) and rainfall, as explanatory variables. Regression {{analysis was used to}} describe the relationship between landings and SST. The models explained between 50. 16 and 51. 07 % of the variability of the LPUE, with the most important factors being winter NAO index, SST and wind strength. The LPUE of European sardine and Atlantic horse mackerel was negatively correlated with SST, and LPUE of Atlantic chub mackerel was positively correlated with SST. The use <b>of</b> <b>landings</b> <b>of</b> three important species of small pelagic fishes allowed the detection <b>of</b> variations in <b>landings</b> associated with changes in sea water temperature and NAO index...|$|R

40|$|Processors {{adapt to}} the pulse <b>of</b> <b>landings</b> in derby {{fisheries}} by investing in large-scale facilities capable of preserving and storing fish products. In fisheries where the pulse <b>of</b> <b>landings</b> suppresses the ability of processors to meet consumer demand for fresh product, the imposition of individual quota (IQ) systems transforms the associated fish processing industry. The cost of fresh fish processing is generally lower and more malleable than that for preserved fish, and consumers may pay a price premium for fresh product, which creates an opportunity for entry by fresh-fish processors and results in higher equilibrium ex-vessel prices. Incumbent firms are likely to experience an economic dislocation due to a diminished value of nonmalleable capital used to preserve and store fish products. Our paper generalizes and provides a modeling framework for the observed changes in the British Columbian halibut harvester/processor industry complex following the introduction of an IQ system.

The integration of historical time series on the <b>landings</b> and value <b>of</b> <b>landings</b> <b>of</b> Belgian sea fisheries, by fishing area, allows for a spatial analysis of broad-scaled historical preference of different Belgian fisheries for specific fishing areas. It documents changes in the relative importance of fishing areas for the Belgian fisheries as well as changes in composition <b>of</b> <b>landings</b> from within fishing areas over 8 decades (1929 - 2009) and underlines the historical importance of the 'coastal waters' to the Belgian fisheries. Finally, qualitative and quantitative statements about the spatial dynamics of Belgian fisheries in published sources are validated and, where not supported by our data, challenged. Some of the cause-effect relations that may explain the spatial dynamics of Belgian sea fisheries, are explored...|$|R
