25|$|The {{first episode}} of Chef! was {{developed}} over two years, and so Peter Tilbury and I were really put through loads of hoops about character motivation. <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> character such an arsehole? Is this {{the right kind}} of character for Lenny Henry to be playing? All that kind of stuff. Once we got through that and they greenlit the series, Peter then had something like eight or nine weeks to write the rest of it. The remaining five episodes were much easier to write because we'd had every argument about who, what, where, and how. The world had been mapped out. Actually, the very first episode of Chef! was the hardest one to watch for me because we'd worked so hard on it and you could see all the things that had been rewritten in the first episode.|$|E
500|$|Pat Nixon did {{not know}} of the secret tape {{recordings}} her husband had made. Julie Nixon Eisenhower stated that the First Lady would have ordered the tapes destroyed immediately, had she known of their existence. Once she did learn of the tapes, she vigorously opposed making them public, and compared them to [...] "private love letters—for one person alone". Believing in her husband's innocence, she also encouraged him not to resign and instead fight all the impeachment charges that were eventually leveled against him. She said to her friend Helene Drown, [...] "Dick has done so much for the country. <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> happening?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But <b>why</b> <b>was</b> <b>this,</b> Rupert," [...] Captain Dillon--for {{he was now}} a captain--asked. [...] "Did {{you call}} his Majesty out? Or did you kiss Madame de Maintenon? Or run away with a maid of honour?" ...|$|R
60|$|A strange pang {{seized upon}} his heart. It thrilled through him, shaking {{him to the}} core. <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> woman so deeply moved? Could it be----? Nonsense; he stifled the thought before it was born.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>this?</b> As the {{majority}} of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software. Hardware must be paid for, but software is something to share. Who cares if {{the people who worked}} on it get paid? ...|$|E
2500|$|DiMaggio also voices Woolter and Jesse (a pun on {{the show}} Breaking Bads main protagonists), two tough rams who are Doug's assistants; a moose that gets a parking ticket from Judy; and the pig {{reporter}} who asks Judy [...] "Why? <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> happening?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Children {{have a very}} {{important}} role in the Passover seder. Traditionally the youngest child is prompted to ask questions about the Passover seder, beginning with the words, Mah Nishtana HaLeila HaZeh (<b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> night different from all other nights?). The questions encourage the gathering to discuss the significance of the symbols in the meal. The questions asked by the child are: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>why</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> {{not told}} to me before?" [...] said Mrs. Tucker, suddenly. [...] "Why {{not at the}} time? Why," [...] she demanded almost fiercely, turning from the one to the other, [...] "has <b>this</b> <b>been</b> kept from me?" ...|$|R
60|$|Thus the two. She had enkindled {{the young}} man's enthusiasm till {{he was quite}} brimming with sentiment; while he from merely affording her {{a new form of}} idleness, had gone on to wake her serious solicitude. <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>this?</b> They could not have told.|$|R
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Denver Westword, Brown said, [...] "One thing [...] gonna <b>be</b> asked <b>is,</b> <b>why</b> did he jump on [...] so quickly {{and go back to}} D.C. so quickly when in ... Benghazi, he went to Las Vegas? <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> so quick? ... At some point, somebody's going to ask that question." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Some have {{stumbled}} {{over the fact}} that I said I did not claim to be a prophet; and they have asked, <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>this?</b> I have had no claims to make, only that I am instructed that I am the Lord's messenger... Early in my youth I was asked several times, Are you a prophet? I have ever responded, I am the Lord's messenger. I know that many have called me a prophet, but I have made no claim to this title." ...|$|E
2500|$|I wasn’t so {{interested}} in macro, but what struck me, and this is related to some of my later work, was the assumption that [...] made to solve for equilibrium, that the state variables were obvious.... Bob and I had some long discussions, and I would say, “Well Bob, <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> the actual state space in this model?” [...] That question came up ... after I came to Penn. [...] At some point Karl [...] and I started talking about that and we developed what we called the idea of sunspots.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{selection}} of Paul Ryan, Portman spoke at the 2012 Republican National Convention about trade and his family business. On trade agreements, Portman stated: [...] "President Obama is the first president in 75 years-Democrat or Republican-who hasn't even sought the ability to negotiate export agreements and open markets overseas. Now <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> important? Because 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside our borders. And to create jobs, our workers and our farmers need to sell more of what we make to those people." [...] On October 13, 2012 Mitt Romney spoke at and toured the Golden Lamb Inn.|$|E
60|$|She knew it <b>was</b> wrong, but <b>why</b> it <b>was</b> wrong troubled her. The law--yes, {{but what}} lay behind the law? The Mormon had one law, the Turks another. <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> English law {{better than any}} other? <b>Why</b> <b>were</b> the animals freer than men? Their lives were good and healthy, {{they lived in the}} {{sunshine}} and were untroubled. Such were a few of the questions she grappled with.|$|R

2500|$|Hirsch {{proved that}} all of the {{dynamics}} of the attractor occur on a manifold of dimension N-1. [...] This basically says that the attractor cannot have dimension greater than N-1. [...] <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> important? [...] A limit cycle cannot exist in fewer than two dimensions. [...] An n-torus cannot exist in less than n dimensions, and finally, chaos cannot occur in less than three dimensions. [...] So, Hirsch proved that competitive Lotka–Volterra systems cannot exhibit a limit cycle for N < 3, or any torus or chaos for N < 4. [...] This is still in agreement with Smale that any dynamics can occur for N ≥ 5.|$|E
2500|$|Kimball {{received}} private {{instruction from}} Joseph Smith on plural marriage (polygamy). Initially reluctant, Kimball accepted the responsibility and married a second wife, Sarah Noon. His first wife, Vilate Murray Kimball, accepted plural marriage and welcomed the additional wives as sisters. Heber and Vilate agreed and gave their 14-year-old daughter Helen Marr as a plural wife of Joseph Smith. Kimball considered the marrying of multiple wives {{an expression of}} his faith in and obedience to God: [...] "I have noticed {{that a man who}} has but one wife, and is inclined to that doctrine, soon begins to wither and dry up, while a man who goes into plurality [...] looks fresh, young, and sprightly. <b>Why</b> <b>is</b> <b>this?</b> Because God loves that man, and because he honors His work and word." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vana's {{criticism}} of the living conditions that candidates live {{in which they have}} zero contact with outsiders was also brought up a year later by contestant Aleksandra King who left the process in the fourth task, following her departure she said: [...] "I can't tell you in exact detail how much contact I was allowed with my family but, for me, the restricted contact was not good enough. I {{would have liked to have}} picked up the phone and just said, [...] "How are you guys? OK, Great." [...] I was not able to do that. I've got a nine-year-old, a seven-year-old and a five-year-old but it's the work-life balance thing because there are other mums in there who have younger kids and it was OK for them. But for me, I started to get slightly irritated because I felt like <b>why</b> <b>is</b> <b>this</b> even a business tip, what has lack of contact with my family got to do with it? It was winding me up and going on in my head.' King later remarked that The Apprentice includes a [...] "blame culture" [...] and the atmosphere [...] "wasn't necessarily great for business".|$|E

6000|$|Eve. O wondrous {{power of}} matchless love exprest! [...] [Embracing him. <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> trial thine, of loving best?

5|$|Number two, <b>why</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> person, {{this one}} of the six around to commit this hideous crime? He was out because he had a 31-count {{indictment}} for the rape of a child, and he was out on $15,000 bail, instead of the requisite $450,000 bail that he never could have made and never would have been on the street.|$|R

40|$|The {{controversy}} {{regarding the}} once widely used mercury-containing preservative thimerosal in childhood vaccines has raised many historical {{questions that have}} not <b>been</b> adequately explored. <b>Why</b> <b>was</b> <b>this</b> preservative incorporated in the first place?

6000|$|Many {{have visited}} the station before me; they {{seem not to}} have heard the rumour.

It is so ironic since “using weak narrations” was also used by the Al-Azhar Committee of Fatwa in refuting Da’esh in another case, i.e., the burning of the Jordanian Pilot (Dar al Ifta, nd[b]). Bear in mind also that the list of scholars signing Open Letter includes ten members of the Al-Azhar Committee of Fatwa.|$|R
