Examples of such problems include the dining philosophers problem and other similar mutual exclusion problems.

[...] She argued that obscenity laws were largely ineffectual, that when they were effectual they only suppressed pornography from public view while allowing it to flourish out of sight, and that they suppressed the wrong material, or the right material for the wrong reasons, arguing that [...] "Obscenity laws are also woman-hating in their very construction.

[...] When JNA troops transferred to the front via the Višegrad region of north-eastern Bosnia, local Bosnian Croats and Muslims set up barricades and machine-gun posts. They halted a column of 60 JNA tanks but were dispersed by force the following day. More than 1,000 people had to flee the area.

But the credit has to be shared between all the chaps – and I am over the moon." [...] The Italian further added that their goal now was to win the league championship: [...] "The next step will be the Premier League, fingers crossed.

500|$|Robey {{returned}} to the London Hippodrome in 1919 where he took {{a leading role in}} another hit revue, Joy Bells. Phyllis Bedells took over from Pollard as his stage partner, with Anita Elson and Leon Errol as supporting dancers. Robey played the role of an old-fashioned father who is mystified over the changing traditions after the First World War. He interpolated two music hall sketches: [...] "No, No, No" [...] centred on turning innocent, everyday sayings into suggestive and provocative maxims, and [...] "The Rest Cure" [...] told the story of a pre-op hospital patient who hears worrying stories of malpractice from his well-meaning friends who visit him. In the Italian newspaper La Tribuna, the writer Emilio Cecchi commented: [...] "Robey, just by being Robey, makes us laugh until we weep. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to see either Figaro or Othello; it is quite enough for Robey to appear in travelling costume and to turn his eyes in crab-like fashion {{from one side of the}} auditorium to another. Robey's aspect in dealing with his audience is paternal and, one might say, apostolic." [...] Joy Bells ran for 723 performances.|$|E
500|$|Wipeout Pulse was {{developed}} by Sony Studio Liverpool (formerly known as Psygnosis). Colin Berry, the lead designer of the game, stated {{in an interview that}} the team had received a lot of positive feedback from Wipeout Pure, and was willing to use parts of the feedback to [...] "help shape some elements of Pulse". According to Berry, some people had felt that the previous game was too difficult; the ships were considered too fast and the artificial intelligence (AI) too advanced, whereas others thought that the game was too easy and they wanted [...] "something more challenging to keep them coming back". The development team also took steps to decrease the feeling of repetition, which was often cited as one of the main complaints of Wipeout Pure. In addition, the team altered the game's difficulty settings so that players were given the choice to change the speed of the game at any time, in the event that they [...] "got stuck". Reflecting on this, Berry said: [...] "We want the people who buy it, to see all the game, <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to lock them out".|$|E

500|$|Morale on the {{battlefield}} was poor. JNA commanders resorted to firing on their own positions to motivate their men to fight. When the commander of a JNA unit at Vukovar demanded to know {{who was willing to}} fight and who wanted to go home, the unit split in two; one conscript, unable to decide which side to take, shot himself on the spot. A JNA officer who served at Vukovar later described how his men refused to obey orders on several occasions, [...] "abandoning combat vehicles, discarding weapons, gathering on some flat ground, sitting and singing Give Peace a Chance by John Lennon." [...] In late October, an entire infantry battalion from Novi Sad in Serbia abandoned an attack on Borovo Naselje and fled. Another group of reservists threw away their weapons and went back to Serbia on foot across a nearby bridge. A tank driver, Vladimir Živković, drove his vehicle from the front line at Vukovar to the Yugoslav parliament in Belgrade, where he parked on the steps in front of the building. He was arrested and declared insane by the authorities. His treatment enraged his colleagues, who protested by taking over a local radio station at gunpoint and issuing a declaration that [...] "we are not traitors, but <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to be aggressors." ...|$|E
500|$|Along with Anton Robinson, Marcus Browning and Stuart Beavon, Doe {{signed a}} new {{contract}} with Weymouth in May 2008. His only goal for Weymouth in the 2008–09 season was against Forest Green Rovers on 25 August, after scoring the equalizer to make the score 1–1 in the 71st minute, with a tap-in following a cross from Ryan Williams. In September, Doe was transfer listed, alongside James Coutts, Danny Knowles, Josh Webb and Michael Malcolm to generate money and bring new players to the club. He responded to being transfer listed by saying [...] "I do not {{see it as a}} big deal. It's not like the club has said to me we are putting you on the transfer list because <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> you anymore", and suggested it could benefit both parties if a bigger club were willing to [...] "pay a bit of money". On 4 October, Doe was sent off in Weymouth's 3–2 home win over Eastbourne Borough, after he committed a foul on Andy Atkin in the penalty area, which resulted in a penalty kick that was later saved. Southern League Premier Division club Farnborough approached Doe on 30 December. He turned the offer down saying; [...] "moving to Farnborough would mean stepping down two levels which is not what I want to do". His last game for Weymouth was against Stevenage Borough on 14 February, in the 3–0 home defeat.|$|E
500|$|There was a noted {{effort on}} the part of Corps staff and other Transylvanian exiles (Ion Agârbiceanu, Laurian Gabor, Octavian Tăslăuanu etc.) to {{encourage}} the rapid integration of Podil-formed units into the Romanian line of defense. After a quick session of retraining, the Corps units were attached to the 11th Division, which was recovering in Iași. It was, however, decided that the formations, particularly those from Transylvania, were to be kept distinguished from the rest under the common command structure. An official act of 1918 explained the rationale behind this act: [...] "Transylvanians should fight as Transylvanians [...] against the Hungarian state, so as to assert, clearly and beyond all doubt, that the Romanian nationals of the Hungarian state do not recognize its authority. To have fought against Hungary, however the war may end, ought to have been a badge of honor for the Romanian nation in Hungary and a moral reinforcement during the battles to come". When it was proposed that men from the Corps be assigned noms de guerre so as to avoid execution if captured, Deleu reacted strongly: [...] "We intend to be the army of Transylvania! We aim to be the conscience of Transylvania, which is for absolute freedom and The Union! <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> [...] a conquered land, we wish to liberate ourselves with our own forces! Hangings? Let them hang us! But let them be aware that Transylvania herself is fighting for liberty and The Union!" ...|$|E

He also felt that the storyline of putting Jack on TGS with Tracy Jordan was [...] "fun", but thought [...] "that for some reason fell a bit flat". Tom Shales of The Washington Post felt that [...] "30 Rock had [...] "consistently and considerably improved since its premiere". He praised Alec Baldwin, whose performance he described as [...] "rare and rich [...] perilously close to perfect, beyond improving". Shales said that it was [...] "painful to report" [...] that Jack McBrayer was absent in the episode, saying he was [...] "the show's brightest discovery", and his [...] "performance has been a bittersweet beauty". Rob Canning of IGN said that 30 Rocks was [...] "one new comedy <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> to see taken off the air". He said that [...] "Jack-Tor" [...] had him [...] "laughing from every angle", and may have [...] "begun a debate as to which character is more fun to watch– Jack Donaghy or Tracy Jordan?".

500|$|The {{controversy}} surrounding Manhunt reached a peak on July 28, 2004, {{when the game}} {{was linked to the}} murder of 14-year-old Stefan Pakeerah by his 17-year-old friend Warren Leblanc in Leicestershire, England. Initial media reports claimed that police had found a copy of the game in Leblanc's bedroom, which police had seized as evidence, and Giselle Pakeerah, the victim's mother, stated [...] "I think that I heard some of Warren's friends say that he was obsessed by this game. To quote from the website that promotes it, it calls it a psychological experience, not a game, and it encourages brutal killing. If he was obsessed by it, it could well be that the boundaries for him became quite hazy." [...] Stefan's father, Patrick, added [...] "they were playing a game called Manhunt. The way Warren committed the murder this is how the game is set out, killing people using weapons like hammers and knives. There is some connection between the game and what he has done." [...] Patrick continued [...] "The object of Manhunt is not just to go out and kill people. It's a point-scoring game where you increase your score depending on how violent the killing is. That explains why Stefan's murder was as horrific as it was. If these games influence kids to go out and kill, then <b>we</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> them in the shops." [...] A spokesman for the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers' Association (ELSPA) responded to the accusations by stating [...] "We sympathize enormously with the family and parents of Stefan Pakeerah. However, we reject any suggestion or association between the tragic events and the sale of the video game Manhunt. The game in question is classified 18 by the British Board of Film Classification and therefore its copies should not be in the possession of a minor. Simply being in someone's possession does not and should not lead to the conclusion that a game is responsible for these tragic events." ...|$|E
500|$|In January Sylvia {{was summoned}} to Paris, where Emmeline and Christabel were waiting. Their mother had just {{returned}} from another tour of the US, and Sylvia had just been released from prison. All three women were exhausted and stressed, which added considerably to the tension. In her 1931 book The Suffrage Movement Sylvia describes Christabel as an unreasonable figure, haranguing her for refusing to toe the WSPU line:She turned to me. [...] "You have your own ideas. <b>We</b> <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>want</b> that; we want all our women to take their instructions and walk in step like an army!" [...] Too tired, too ill to argue, I made no reply. I was oppressed by a sense of tragedy, grieved by her ruthlessness. Her glorification of autocracy seemed to me remote indeed from the struggle we were waging, the grim fight even now proceeding in the cells. I thought of many others who had been thrust aside for some minor difference.With their mother's blessing, Christabel ordered Sylvia's group to dissociate from the WSPU. Pankhurst tried to persuade the ELFS to remove the word [...] "suffragettes" [...] from its name, since it was inextricably linked to the WSPU. When Sylvia refused, her mother switched to fierce anger in a letter:You are unreasonable, always have been & I fear always will be. I suppose you were made so!... Had you chosen a name which we could approve we could have done much to launch you & advertise your society by name. Now you must take your own way of doing so. I am sorry but you make your own difficulties by an incapacity to look at situations from other people's point of view as well as your own. Perhaps in time you will learn the lessons that we all have to learn in life.Adela, unemployed and unsure of her future, had become a worry for Pankhurst as well. She decided that Adela should move to Australia, and paid for her relocation. They never saw one another again.|$|E
