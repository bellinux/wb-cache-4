5|$|Lombardy {{noted the}} shock that Spassky was in after he resigned:While Fischer dashed for his car, Spassky {{remained}} glued to his seat. A sympathetic Lothar Schmid came over, {{and the two}} shifted the pieces about with Boris demonstrating his careless mistakes. The two were left <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> Bobby could have squeezed a win from a position which a night of competent analysis by a renowned Soviet team had showed to be a guaranteed draw.|$|E
5|$|Waters Davis stipulated in his sale to Deering {{that the}} Cape Florida {{lighthouse}} be restored. Deering {{wrote to the}} U.S. government seeking specifications and guidelines for the lighthouse. Government officials were {{taken aback by the}} request, <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> a federal lighthouse could have passed into private hands. An Act of Congress and two Executive Orders, in 1847 and 1897, had reserved the island for the federal lighthouse and for military purposes. Patient legal work eventually convinced the U.S. Congress and President Woodrow Wilson to agree to recognize Matheson's and Deering's ownership of Key Biscayne.|$|E
60|$|And {{then when}} he looks back, he is {{astonished}} at himself. He <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> he could dare so much; <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> he could endure so much; <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> the right thought came into {{his head at the}} right moment. He hardly knows himself again. It seems to him, when he thinks over it all, like a grand and awful dream. And the world is astonished at him likewise. They cry, 'Who would have thought there was so much in this man? who would have expected such things of him?' And they call him a hero--and so he is.|$|R

When Kecal increases the offer to 300florins, Jeník pretends to accept, but imposes a condition – no one but Mícha's son {{will be allowed to}} wed Mařenka. Kecal agrees, and rushes off to prepare the contract. Alone, Jeník ponders the deal he has apparently made to barter his beloved ("When you discover whom you've bought"), <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> anyone could believe that he would really do this, and finally expressing his love for Mařenka.|$|E
5|$|The {{reader is}} forced to {{question}} {{the stability of the}} Hackee union: Chippy stays away from home long after Timmy's situation is resolved and returns to his wife only after being frightened from the tree by a bear entirely superfluous to the tale. At home, Chippy suffers with a head cold, but Mrs. Hackee's lack of expression in the illustration leaves the reader <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> she took his abrupt return. One wonders why Mrs. Hackee did not pursue Chippy once she learned of his whereabouts from a bird. After the reader discovers Goody is the happy mother of triplets and Timmy has made the decision to keep his nuts under lock and key, he may wonder what sort of fate the future holds for the Hackees.|$|E
25|$|In the Spring of 1855, as the Crimean war developed, Darwin was {{pondering the}} war of nature, taking the then current analogy with an {{industrial}} economy further than others, and <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> species spread. He was dismissive of the ideas that others had put forward of sunken continents like Atlantis, and began experimenting in his house with soaking seeds in brine then seeing if they could germinate. He reported his results in Gardeners' Chronicle and roped in his curate friends including Henslow. The consul in Norway sent seed pods which had washed ashore. Hooker was able to identify them as coming from the Caribbean {{and get them to}} germinate at Kew. Investigation of variation brought him back to animal husbandry. He now began dissecting domestic animals and breeding pigeons, joining a pigeon fancier's club: very unorthodox behaviour for naturalists at that time.|$|E

25|$|Within the novels, {{opponents of}} the Culture {{have argued that the}} role of humans in the Culture is nothing more than that of pets, or parasites on Culture Minds, and that they can have nothing {{genuinely}} useful to contribute to a society where science is close to omniscient about the physical universe, where every ailment has been cured, and where every thought can be read. Many of the Culture novels in fact contain characters (from within or without the Culture) <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> far-reaching the Minds' dominance of the Culture is, and how much of the democratic process within it might in fact be a sham: subtly but very powerfully influenced by the Minds in much the same ways Contact and Special Circumstances influence other societies.

25|$|Even {{though he}} used over sixty mules, he knew to the item what {{each of them}} carried, where they were being {{delivered}} to {{and what he had}} to charge. And although he ran mule trains for over half a century he never lost a pound of cargo, except in one instance when his secundo, upon smelling a two-pound package of Limburger Cheese, decided it was rotten and threw it away. Once aware of the error, Cataline made sure it was replaced and delivered. One of the best stories about him involves a loan that he had to make after a fatal disease had killed several of his mules. The bank manager questioned Cataline's collateral, <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> many mules and horses he owned before consenting to lend him the money. When Cataline returned to the bank in the fall to repay the debt, he counted out the exact amount owing and paid it in full. The bank manager noted that Cataline had more money on his person and suggested that he deposit it in the bank. Cataline responded with a query as to how many horses and mules the bank owned, and upon learning it was none, decided to keep his money.|$|E

Doggett interprets this statement as reflecting Harrison's [...] "decaying relationship" [...] with McCartney at the time.

Brian Zoromski of IGN rated the episode with a 9 out of 10, an indication of an [...] "amazing" [...] episode.

500|$|Results May Vary was {{released}} on September 23, 2003, and received largely unfavorable reviews.

[...] The Guardian reviewer Caroline Sullivan wrote, [...] "At least Limp Bizkit can't be accused of festering in the rap-rock ghetto [...] But Durst's problems are ever-present – and does anybody still care?" [...] Despite criticisms of the album, it was a commercial success, peaking at No.3 on the Billboard 200.|$|E

500|$|Reviewers of {{the first}} three episodes {{interpreted}} Carnivàles story as being full of myth and allegory. The show was seen as more than just a human-scaled metaphor of good and evil, with the power of spirits as one of the show's strongest elements. Some reviewers were deeply confused and described almost everything as [...] "mysterious" [...] the characters and their powers and abilities, characters and scenarios within visions, the whole carnival [...] <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> it all fit together. The visions of the two main characters were shortly addressed, distinguishing between violent and benign visions, but parallels between the visions and the beings of good and evil were not necessarily drawn. The characters' stories were described as unfolding in [...] "zig-zagging starts, moving back and forth in time and space, dropping oblique clues along the way." ...|$|E
500|$|Bathurst and Thomas express {{contrasting}} {{views on}} the significance of Stroma's abandonment. Thomas regards it as a tragedy: [...] "Of all the out-of-the-way places I have known, this was the saddest. It seemed as though its life had been ended {{in a fit of}} pique." [...] To Bathurst, however, [...] "it is tempting to see Stroma's abandonment as the result of some appalling trauma. Abandonment is always taken as a sign of failure, a collective death... But Stroma does not feel sad. True, there is sorrow in seeing the once meticulous vegetable patches turned over to weeds, or <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> many more winters the box beds will stand before they start to rot. But that isn't the whole story. What is interesting about Stroma is not the fact of its abandonment, but the tale of its past." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{that time}} films {{typically}} had an [...] "omniscient perspective", which Marilyn Fabe says give the audience the [...] "illusion {{that we are}} looking with impunity into a world which is unaware of our gaze, Hollywood movies give us a feeling of power." [...] The film begins in this fashion up until the News on the March sequence, after which we the audience see the film through the perspectives of others. The News on the March sequence gives an overview of Kane's entire life (and the film's entire story) {{at the beginning of}} the film, leaving the audience without the typical suspense of <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> it will end. Instead the film's repetitions of events compels the audience to analyze and wonder why Kane's life happened the way that it did, under the pretext of finding out what [...] "Rosebud" [...] means. The film then returns to the omniscient perspective in the final scene, when only the audience discovers what [...] "Rosebud" [...] is.|$|E
