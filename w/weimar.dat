5|$|After serving {{five years}} of exile to Russia, Mickiewicz {{received}} permission to go abroad in 1829. On 1 June that year, he arrived in <b>Weimar.</b> By 6 June he was in Berlin, where he attended lectures by the philosopher Hegel. In February 1830 he visited Prague, later returning to <b>Weimar,</b> where he received a cordial reception from the writer, scientist and politician Goethe.|$|E

5|$|<b>Weimar,</b> where Bach {{worked from}} 1708. The {{conductor}} and academic Jonathan Green dates the work c. 1708–1710; the Bach scholar William G. Whittaker dates it c. 1712.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata in <b>Weimar,</b> but the composition history is complicated {{and not at}} all stages certain. Findings by Martin Petzoldt suggest that the cantata began with the later movements 2–6 and 9, most of them on biblical text, performed at a memorial service of Aemilia Maria Haress, the wife of a former prime-minister of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, at the church St. Peter und Paul in <b>Weimar</b> on 8 October 1713. Bach may then have expanded it and presented it for his application in December 1713 at the Liebfrauenkirche in Halle. The performance material of this event, the only surviving source, shows on the title page the designation , indicating that the cantata with its general readings and texts is suitable for any occasion.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>Weimar</b> Republic, the black-red-gold colours {{were the}} colours of the democratic, centrist, and republican {{political}} parties, {{as seen in}} the name of Reichsbanner Schwarz-Rot-Gold, formed by members of the Social Democratic, the Centre, and the Democratic parties to defend the republic against extremists on the right and left.|$|E
5|$|Following {{specifications}} {{set by the}} (West) German {{government in}} 1950, the flag displays three bars of equal width and has a width–length ratio of 3:5; the tricolor used during the <b>Weimar</b> Republic had a ratio of 2:3.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{declaration}} of the German republic in 1918 and the ensuing revolutionary period, the so-called <b>Weimar</b> Republic was founded in August 1919. To form a continuity between the anti-autocratic movement of the 19th century and the new democratic republic, the old black-red-gold tricolour was designated as the national German flag in the <b>Weimar</b> Constitution in 1919. Only the tiny German principalities of Reuss-Greiz, Reuss-Gera, and Waldeck-Pyrmont and its republican successor had upheld the tradition and had always continued to use the German colours of black, red, and or (gold) in their flag. As a civil ensign, the black-white-red tricolour was retained, albeit with the new tricolour in the top left corner.|$|E
5|$|In January 1945, {{with the}} Soviet army approaching, the Germans decide to flee, taking 60,000 inmates on a death march to {{concentration}} camps in Germany. Eliezer {{and his father}} are marched to Gleiwitz {{to be put on}} a freight train to Buchenwald, a camp near <b>Weimar,</b> 350 miles (563km) from Auschwitz.|$|E

5|$|Nur jedem das Seine (To each his own!), , is {{a church}} cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach. He {{composed}} it in <b>Weimar</b> for the twenty-third Sunday after Trinity and first performed it on 24 November 1715.|$|E
5|$|The {{heavy cruiser}} Admiral Scheer {{was named after}} Reinhard Scheer and christened by his {{daughter}} Marianne. The ship was ordered and funded by the Reichsmarine of the <b>Weimar</b> Republic and launched in 1933.|$|E
5|$|Under Piłsudski, Poland {{maintained}} {{good relations}} with neighboring Romania, Hungary and Latvia. Relations were strained with Czechoslovakia, however, and were still worse with Lithuania. Relations with <b>Weimar</b> Germany and the Soviet Union varied over time, but during Piłsudski's tenure could {{for the most part}} be described as neutral.|$|E
5|$|Wagner was {{to spend}} the next twelve years in exile from Germany. He had {{completed}} Lohengrin, the last of his middle-period operas, before the Dresden uprising, and now wrote desperately to his friend Franz Liszt to have it staged in his absence. Liszt conducted the premiere in <b>Weimar</b> in August 1850.|$|E
5|$|Weber {{joined the}} worker and soldier council of Heidelberg in 1918. He then {{served in the}} German {{delegation}} to the Paris Peace Conference and as advisor to the Confidential Committee for Constitutional Reform, which drafted the <b>Weimar</b> Constitution. Motivated by {{his understanding of the}} American model, he advocated a strong, popularly elected presidency as a constitutional counterbalance {{to the power of the}} professional bureaucracy. More controversially, he also defended the provisions for emergency presidential powers that became Article 48 of the <b>Weimar</b> Constitution. These provisions were later used by Adolf Hitler to subvert the rest of the constitution and institute rule by decree, allowing his regime to suppress opposition and gain dictatorial powers.|$|E
5|$|Allegations {{have been}} made of {{omissions}} in the history described by the film. The absence of discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was noticed by some viewers. Davis claimed that Leo Strauss's ideas had been formed by his experiences in Germany during the <b>Weimar</b> Republic, and alleged that the film's failure to mention this was motivated by a wish to portray Strauss as concerned with American suburban culture, like Qutb.|$|E
5|$|At Hitler's invitation, Goebbels {{spoke at}} party {{meetings}} in Munich {{and at the}} annual Party Congress, held in <b>Weimar</b> in 1926. For the following year's event, Goebbels {{was involved in the}} planning for the first time. He and Hitler arranged for the rally to be filmed. Receiving praise for doing well at these events led Goebbels to shape his political ideas to match Hitler's, and to admire and idolize him even more.|$|E
5|$|Frank {{was born}} on 19 August 1920 in Karlsruhe-Grünwinkel in what was the Republic of Baden of the <b>Weimar</b> Republic; Grünwinkel is now a borough located in the {{southwest}} suburbs of Karlsruhe. Frank was the older of two sons of a shoemaker. He attended the Volksschule (elementary school) in Grünwinkel from 1926 to 1930, when he was enrolled in the Realgymnasium—a secondary school built on the mid-level Realschule—where he attained his Mittlere Reife (school leaving certificate) in 1939.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of the liturgical year on the first Sunday in Advent, Bach {{composed}} prolifically. He wrote works for three consecutive Sundays in Advent, prompted probably by the death of the Kapellmeister Johann Samuel Drese on 1 December 1716. When Bach's hope to become Drese's successor was not realized, he ceased to compose cantatas for the <b>Weimar</b> court.|$|E
5|$|Géza {{accompanied}} his father, {{who left}} for Poland to seek assistance against King Andrew. They returned with Polish reinforcements in 1060. Géza {{was one of}} his father's most influential advisors. Lampert of Hersfeld wrote that Géza persuaded his father to set free Count William of <b>Weimar,</b> one of the commanders of the German troops fighting on Andrew's side, who had been captured in a battle.|$|E
5|$|In December 1877, Saint-Saëns had a {{more solid}} operatic success, with Samson et Dalila, his one opera to gain and keep {{a place in the}} {{international}} repertoire. Because of its biblical subject, the composer had met many obstacles to its presentation in France, and through Liszt's influence the premiere was given at <b>Weimar</b> in a German translation. Although the work eventually became an international success it was not staged at the Paris Opéra until 1892.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} table of the movements, the scoring and keys are given for the version performed in <b>Weimar</b> in 1714. The keys and time signatures are taken from the Bach scholar Alfred Dürr, using the symbol for common time (4/4). The instruments are shown separately for winds and strings, while the continuo, playing throughout, is not shown.|$|E
5|$|Lemke, {{the son of}} a civil servant, {{was born}} on 27 September 1920 in Gundelsdorf near Arnswalde, in what was then the Free State of Prussia of the <b>Weimar</b> Republic (today Choszczno in Poland). He joined the {{military}} service of the Luftwaffe as a Fahnenjunker (cadet) on 15 November 1939. Following fighter pilot training, he was promoted to Leutnant (second lieutenant) on 1 April 1941.|$|E
5|$|Lützow {{graduated}} with his Abitur (university-preparatory high school diploma) on 31 March 1931 from the Schulpforta, {{a boarding school}} for academically gifted students. Unlike his brothers, who both pursued a naval career, Lützow joined the Reichswehr (Army of the <b>Weimar</b> Republic) following his graduation from school. This decision had been influenced by his mother's youngest brother, Eberhard Kinzel, at the time {{an officer in the}} Reichswehr and later General der Infanterie (General of the Infantry) in the Heer (German Army).|$|E
5|$|On 2 March 1714 Bach was {{appointed}} concertmaster of the <b>Weimar</b> court capelle of the co-reigning dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe-Weimar. As concertmaster, he assumed the principal responsibility for composing new works, specifically cantatas for the Schlosskirche (palace church), {{on a monthly}} schedule. He wrote this cantata for the fourth Sunday in Advent, dating it himself.|$|E
5|$|The cantata was {{edited by}} Franz Wüllner for the Bach Gesellschaft Ausgabe, the first {{complete}} edition of Bach's works, in a volume published in 1887. The New Bach Edition (Neue Bach-Ausgabe, NBA) published the score {{of both the}} <b>Weimar</b> and the Leipzig version in 1982, edited by , with the critical commentary following in 1984.|$|E
5|$|The cantata was {{published}} by Breitkopf & Härtel in 1888 in volume 35 of the first complete edition of Bach's works by the Bach Gesellschaft, edited by Alfred Dörffel. In the Neue Bach-Ausgabe, the second complete edition of Bach's works, in the historical-critical edition, Dietrich Kilian edited both the reconstructed <b>Weimar</b> version (1959) and the first Leipzig version (1960) in volume 13, adding the critical report in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata {{in his fourth}} year as Thomaskantor (musical director) in Leipzig. The text {{is based on the}} day's prescribed reading from the Gospel of Mark, the healing of a deaf mute man. The librettist is Georg Christian Lehms, whose poetry Bach had used already in <b>Weimar</b> as the basis for solo cantatas. The text quotes ideas from the gospel and derives from these the analogy that as the tongue of the deaf mute man was opened, the believer should be open to admire God's miraculous deeds. The cantatas for this Sunday have a positive character, which Bach stressed in earlier works for the occasion by including trumpets in the score. In this work, he uses instead an obbligato solo organ in several movements.|$|E
5|$|Bach led {{the first}} {{performance}} of the cantata on 16 June 1715. The performance material for <b>Weimar</b> is lost. Bach performed the work again as Thomaskantor in Leipzig. Extant performance material was prepared by his assistant Johann Christian Köpping. The first possible revival is the Trinity Sunday of Bach's first year in office, 4 June 1724, also the conclusion of his first year and first Leipzig cantata cycle, because he had assumed the office on the first Sunday after Trinity the year before. Bach made presumably minor changes.|$|E
5|$|Bach {{structured}} the cantata in five movements, {{an instrumental}} sinfonia, a recitative, a recitative with chorale, an aria and a closing chorale. He scored the work, like other cantatas written in <b>Weimar,</b> {{for a small}} ensemble of three vocal soloists (soprano (S), tenor (T), bass (B)), a four-part choir only in the chorales, and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of four violas (Va), cello (Vc), bassoon (Fg) and basso continuo. The setting for four violas is unusual. In a similar orchestration, the Brandenburg Concerto No. 6 also omits violins.|$|E
5|$|Bach was {{appointed}} organist and chamber musician in <b>Weimar</b> {{at the court}} of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August on 25 June 1708. He had composed sacred cantatas before, some during his tenure in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. Most were written for special occasions and were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns. Examples include: Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131; the early chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4 for Easter; Gott ist mein König, BWV 71, to celebrate the inauguration of the new city council on 4 February 1708; and the Actus Tragicus for a funeral.|$|E
5|$|During this time, {{he joined}} the Jungfrontkämpfervereinigung, the youth section of Hermann Hiltl's right-wing {{veterans}} movement, and began reading newspapers published by the Nazi Party (NSDAP). The party platform included removal of the <b>Weimar</b> Republic in Germany, rejection {{of the terms of}} the Treaty of Versailles, radical antisemitism, and anti-Bolshevism. They promised a strong central government, increased Lebensraum (living space) for Germanic peoples, formation of a national community based on race, and racial cleansing via the active suppression of Jews, who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights.|$|E
5|$|Hermann Anton Graf {{was born}} on 24 October 1912 in Engen {{in what was then}} the Grand Duchy of Baden near Lake Constance and the Swiss border, the son of Wilhelm Graf (1878–1937), a farmer, and his wife Maria, née Sailer (1877–1953). He was the third of three children, with two older brothers, Wilhelm Wilhelm (1904–1981) and Josef Wilhelm (1909–1981). His father fought in and survived World War I as an {{artillery}} soldier, being awarded the Iron Cross. Postwar, the <b>Weimar</b> Inflation crisis of 1923 wiped out virtually all the family savings, and as a result, from a very early age, Graf had to work.|$|E
5|$|Hitler was {{discharged}} from the army on 31 March 1920 and began working full-time for the NSDAP. The party headquarters was in Munich, a hotbed of anti-government German nationalists determined to crush Marxism and undermine the <b>Weimar</b> Republic. In February 1921—already highly effective at speaking to large audiences—he spoke to a crowd of over 6,000. To publicise the meeting, two truckloads of party supporters drove around Munich waving swastika flags and distributing leaflets. Hitler soon gained notoriety for his rowdy polemic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians, and especially against Marxists and Jews.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Germany {{became a}} nation state {{when most of}} the German states unified into the Prussian-dominated German Empire. After World War I and the {{revolution}} of 1918–19, the Empire was replaced by the parliamentary <b>Weimar</b> Republic. The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 led to the establishment of a dictatorship, World War II and the Holocaust. After the end of World War II in Europe and a period of Allied occupation, two German states were founded: the democratic West Germany and the socialist East Germany. Following the Revolutions of 1989 that ended communist rule in Central and Eastern Europe, the country was reunified on 3 October 1990.|$|E
