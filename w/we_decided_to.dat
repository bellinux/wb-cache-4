5|$|I {{saw them}} as the {{ultimate}} all-American band. To me, they reflected the American character in general—an almost childish innocent aggression.... I thought, 'The Great Seal of the President of the United States' would be perfect for the Ramones, with the eagle holding arrows—to symbolize strength and the aggression {{that would be used}} against whomever dares to attack us—and an olive branch, offered to those who want to be friendly. But <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> change it a little bit. Instead of the olive branch, we had an apple tree branch, since the Ramones were American as apple pie. And since Johnny was such a baseball fanatic, we had the eagle hold a baseball bat instead of the 's arrows.|$|E
25|$|At {{first we}} used a {{character}} {{that looked like a}} rabbit with ears that could extend and pick up objects. As the game got faster and faster, we needed {{to come up with a}} special characteristic to give our character some power over his enemies. I remembered a character I had thought about years ago who could roll himself into a ball and slam into enemies. Hedgehogs can roll themselves into a ball, so <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> go from a rabbit to a hedgehog.|$|E

In fact at 67, he had diabetes, some rheumatism, the odd creaky joint, a healthy {{capacity}} to whinge and the usual symptoms connected with smoking and drinking. But by now the horses were gone and the dog had died. He was eating less and drinking more. One night, he fell down the stairs. He was discovered the next morning on the floor by his housekeeper. He was rushed to the local hospital where pneumonia in one lung was treated effectively and efficiently, a fracture near his hip was repaired and he was diagnosed with brain damage. We were to learn he had Korsakoff's syndrome (an alcohol-related condition) and <b>we</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> keep it private.|$|E

25|$|After {{the intense}} touring {{that had been}} taking place through the first two albums, working almost 24 hours a day, basically, we managed to stop and have a proper break, {{a couple of months}} as opposed to a couple of weeks. <b>We</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> go off and rent a cottage to provide a {{contrast}} to motel rooms. Obviously, it had quite an effect on the material that was written... It was the tranquility of the place that set the tone of the album. Obviously, we weren't crashing away at 100 watt Marshall stacks. Having played acoustic and being interested in classical guitar, anyway, being in a cottage without electricity, it was acoustic guitar time... After all the heavy, intense vibe of touring which is reflected in the raw energy of the second album, it was just a totally different feeling.|$|E

So it needs to be malleable ... It's as much a piece of art as the music is, so we want it to be compelling and fit with the overall kind of aesthetic of what the band is up to right at this moment." ...|$|E
