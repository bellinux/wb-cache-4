25|$|ISIL aims {{to return}} to the early days of Islam, rejecting all {{innovations}} in the religion, which it believes corrupts its original spirit. It condemns later caliphates and the Ottoman Empire for deviating from <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>calls</b> pure Islam, and seeks to revive the original Wahhabi project of the restoration of the caliphate governed by strict Salafist doctrine. Following Salafi-Wahhabi tradition, ISIL condemns the followers of secular law as disbelievers, putting the current Saudi Arabian government in that category.|$|E

25|$|As a result, the CPC and CPC (ML) are {{not moving}} towards forming a united party.

25|$|The church teaches <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>calls</b> {{the law of}} chastity, a {{moral code}} that its members must follow {{to be in good}} {{standing}} with the church. At its core, the law of chastity prohibits sexual relations between individuals who are not married, adultery, and sexual relations between gay and lesbian partners whether married or not. The law also prohibits other sexual behavior, such as bestiality and masturbation, as well as mental behavior such as lust, sexual fantasy, and viewing of pornography. The church's teachings are ambiguous about the scope of allowable sexual behavior between legally married couples. Sex in marriage is seen as a means for expressing and building joy, unity, love, and oneness, as well as for producing children.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} no plans to build motorway-standard flank of the ring road at {{national}} government level, Glasgow City Council have recently published new plans for <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>calls</b> the Glasgow East End Regeneration Route (EERR). This would appear not to be a motorway, but instead an urban corridor which will connect the M74 extension at Polmadie with the M8/M80 at Provan. While the Council has openly voiced its commitment to the plan, it will likely face considerable controversy since its path will dissect the suburbs of Bridgeton, Carntyne and Parkhead making use of derelict land and an abandoned railway embankment. As of summer 2013, phases 1 and 2 of the project from the M74 to Parkhead have been completed. Phase 3 from Parkhead Forge to the M80 at Provan is scheduled for completion in 2014.|$|E

25|$|Since 1998 USAID has {{provided}} {{technical assistance to}} INAPA to introduce <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>calls</b> a Total Community Participation approach in rural water supply and sanitation. The project served as a laboratory for INAPA, whose activities in rural areas had been limited to water supply, to engage in community participation, in rural sanitation and hygiene promotion. USAID first supported a pilot project for nine rural communities {{with a total of}} 700 families in Hato Mayor Province with the support of Catholic Relief Services and a Dominican NGO. From 2002 onwards, USAID and the NGO Family Health International supported INAPA in replicating the approach {{in other parts of the}} country. A 2006 evaluation showed that six of the nine pilot communities did not have working systems. The reasons include inappropriate design - pumps and inverters burned out - and the stealing of solar panels. However, the evaluation also showed that the community-based approach has been adopted by other stakeholders, such as CAASD for rural projects in the province of Santo Domingo, an INAPA project supported by Spanisch cooperation and the Peace Corps.|$|E
25|$|In addition, as this {{position}} argues that no country gave Tibet diplomatic recognition between 1912 and 1950, {{they say that}} China, under the Republic of China government, continued to maintain sovereignty over the region, {{and the leaders of}} Tibet themselves acknowledged Chinese sovereignty by sending delegates to the following: the Drafting Committee for a new constitution of the Republic of China in 1925, the National Assembly of the Republic of China in 1931, the fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang in 1931, a National Assembly for drafting a new Chinese constitution in 1946, and finally to another National Assembly for drafting a new Chinese constitution in 1948. Finally, some within the PRC considers all movements aimed at ending Chinese sovereignty in Tibet, starting with British attempts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, to the CTA today, as one long campaign abetted by malicious Western imperialism aimed at destroying Chinese integrity and sovereignty, thereby weakening China's position in the world. The PRC also points to <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>calls</b> the autocratic and theocratic policies of the government of Tibet before 1959, as well as its renunciation of South Tibet, claimed by China as a part of historical Tibet occupied by India, as well as the Dalai Lama's association with India, and as such claims the CTA has no moral legitimacy to govern Tibet.|$|E
