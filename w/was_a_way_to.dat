5|$|Uematsu {{was born}} in Kōchi, Kōchi Prefecture, Japan. A self-taught musician, he began {{to play the piano}} when he was between the ages of eleven and twelve years old, and he did not take any formal piano lessons. He has an older sister who also played the piano. After graduating from Kanagawa University with a degree in English, Uematsu played the {{keyboard}} in several amateur bands and composed music for television commercials. When Uematsu was working at a music rental shop in Tokyo, a Square employee asked if he would be interested in creating music for some of the titles they were working on. Although he agreed, Uematsu at the time considered it a side job, and he did not think it would become a full-time career. He said it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> make some money on the side, while also keeping his part-time job at the music rental shop.|$|E

However, Kids Go was cancelled in July 2006 before broadcasting. Since the two station shared a market and public TV's digital carriage agreement with top cable operators required differentiation of the stations' services, Kids Go! <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> do so.|$|E
25|$|In general, cattlemen did {{not feel}} that fencing was wrong. They {{believed}} they were fencing land unsuitable for any other uses, especially farming. Further, they believed a method of leasing land <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> give value to the government land in the Sandhills and allow fencing to be legal. The House Committee on Public Lands held hearings on leasing and grazing legislation between January and June 1902.|$|E

This paper was related to power and religion, the way through which the Aztecs imposed and justified their dominance in Mesoamerica. As tribute, it represented a transaction between the dominant groups and the dominated villages.

25|$|In 1881 the Dunedin cable tramway system {{opened in}} Dunedin, New Zealand {{and became the}} first such system outside San Francisco. For Dunedin, George Smith Duncan further {{developed}} the Hallidie model, introducing the pull curve and the slot brake; the former <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> pull cars through a curve, since Dunedin's curves were too sharp to allow coasting, while the latter forced a wedge down into the cable slot to stop the car. Both of these innovations were generally adopted by other cities, including San Francisco.|$|E

25|$|Some {{assemblers}} {{have incorporated}} structured programming elements to encode execution flow. The earliest {{example of this}} approach was in the Concept-14 macro set, originally proposed by Dr. Harlan Mills (March 1970), and implemented by Marvin Kessler at IBM's Federal Systems Division, which extended the S/360 macro assembler with IF/ELSE/ENDIF and similar control flow blocks. This <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> reduce or eliminate the use of GOTO operations in assembly code, {{one of the main}} factors causing spaghetti code in assembly language. This approach was widely accepted in the early '80s (the latter days of large-scale assembly language use).|$|E
25|$|Subtleties in, and an {{imperfect}} scholarly understanding of, high Nahuatl rhetorical style make the exact intent of these comments tricky to ascertain, but Restall argues that Moctezuma's politely offering his throne to Cortés (if indeed he did ever give the speech as reported) {{may well have}} been meant as the exact opposite of what it was taken to mean: politeness in Aztec culture <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> assert dominance and show superiority. This speech, which has been widely referred to, has been a factor in the widespread belief that Moctezuma was addressing Cortés as the returning god Quetzalcoatl.|$|E
25|$|With the {{expansion}} of the Portuguese national territory, following the conquest of new lands, the monarchy imposed a structure that permitted permanent dominion and organization of territorial space. There was also a tendency to demarcate lands associated with settlements or seigneurial properties; there was a constant history of forals (the royal charters) being allocated for unorganized territories, as a means to primarily establish fielty rights and encourage medieval settlement. Historically, the institution of the foral system <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> divide the territory and to establish local administrative control (and not regional or hierarchical continuity). Similarly the parish, instituted by the religious orders that dominated the country, controlled local ecclesiastical power at the local level.|$|E

25|$|Apple never {{intended}} to release Pippin on its own. Apple intended to make the Pippin platform an open standard by licensing the technology to third parties, much like how JVC shared the VHS format in the 1970s. Relying on third-party companies to produce Pippin systems <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> increase Macintosh's market share – a goal identical to Apple's clone attempt in the late 1990s. It even encouraged differentiation between systems, {{in order to encourage}} competition – as long as the systems stuck to Apple's reference design to avoid fragmentation. The licensees could improve their systems by improving industrial design, integrating telephony, improving video and audio capabilities, increasing memory capacity, and more.|$|E
25|$|The Crown {{promoted}} the establishment in Mexico of the Neoclassical style {{of art and}} architecture, which had become popular in Spain. This style was a reinterpretation of Greco-Roman references and its use <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> reinforce European dominance in the Spain’s colonies. One Neoclassical artist from the Academy {{at the end of}} the colonial period was Manuel Tolsá. He first taught sculpture at the Academy of San Carlos and then became its second director. Tolsá designed a number of Neoclassical buildings in Mexico but his best known work is an equestrian status of King Charles IV in bronze cast in 1803 and originally placed in the Zócalo. As of 2011 it can be seen at the Museo Nacional de Arte.|$|E
25|$|On 26 October 1955, Diệm {{proclaimed the}} {{formation}} of the Republic of Vietnam, with himself as its first President. Elections were scheduled to reunify the country in 1956, but Diệm refused to hold them, claiming that a free election was not possible in the North. According to Taylor, the rejection of Diệm of the Geneva accord was a way of objecting to the French colonialism of Vietnam. Diệm's disposition over Bảo Đại and the establishment of the First Republic of Vietnam <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> claim Vietnamese independence from France. At the same time, the first Constitution of Republic of Vietnam was promulgated. According to the Constitution, Diệm had almost absolute power over South Vietnam.
