2500|$|Peter Davison, {{the editor}} of Orwell's Complete Works, {{includes}} an interview with George Stuart, a contemporary of Orwell in Burma, who said that Orwell was transferred to Kathar as punishment for shooting an elephant. [...] "An elephant was considered a valuable asset to any timber firm...and Orwell would have been severely reprimanded for such unnecessary slaughter. It was {{not long after the}} incident that he was transferred from Moulmein to a quiet post in Upper Burma called Katha." [...] Davison also includes in the complete works a news item from the Rangoon Gazette, March 22, 1926 which describes a Major E. C. Kenny shooting an elephant in similar circumstances. When one biographer questioned his wife, Sonia Brownell, she replied, [...] "Of course he shot a fucking a [...] elephant. He said he did. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> doubt his word!" ...|$|E
60|$|MISS T. Then <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> {{stand out}} after {{half a dozen}} turns? I thought {{officers}} in the Army didn't tell fibs.|$|E
6000|$|MRS BRIDGENORTH. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> call Lesbia my sister? Dont {{you know}} that it annoys her more than any of the rest of your tricks? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Doctor, {{all that}} may be; but <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not answer my question. Did Mr. Bathurst leave the army because he showed cowardice? If he <b>did,</b> and <b>you</b> know it, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> invite him here? <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> praise him? <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not say, 'In other respects this man {{may be good}} and estimable, but he is that most despicable thing, a coward'?" ...|$|R
60|$|CHARTERIS. <b>Why</b> {{on earth}} <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> suspect me of joking? I never was more serious in my life.|$|R
60|$|Well, if Grizel {{had always}} loved him there was surely {{something}} fine and rare about Tommy. But what was it, Grizel? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> love him, <b>you</b> who saw into him so well and {{demanded so much of}} men? When I ask that question the spirit that hovers round my desk to protect Tommy from me rocks her arms mournfully, as if she did not know the answer; it is only when I seem to see her as she so often was in life, before she got that wound and after, bending over some little child and looking up radiant, that I think I suddenly know why she always loved Tommy. It was because he had such need of her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not accidentally, Mr. Bathurst. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> {{try to run}} {{yourself}} down? I {{suppose you}} will say next you saved my life by an accident." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tonnerre! <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> {{bring in}} that malheureux [...] Nile?--Is it not {{enough that we}} were beaten--disgraced--destroyed--that a friend must tell us of it so often?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-day, Babbitty Bumble; I {{should be}} glad to buy some beeswax. But {{what are you doing}} down here? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> come in at a window, and say Zizz, Bizz, Bizzz?" [...] Mrs. Tittlemouse began to get cross.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{are you so}} obstinate?" [...] {{she exclaimed}} in a low, passionate whisper. [...] "I want to be your friend, and I could be very useful to you. Yet <b>you</b> keep me <b>always</b> at arm's length. You are making a mistake. Indeed you are. I suppose <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not trust me. Yet reflect. Have I ever told you {{anything}} that was not true? Have I ever tried to deceive you? I don't {{pretend to be a}} paragon of the virtues. I live my life to please myself. I admit it. Why not? It is simply applying the same sort of philosophy to my life as you have applied to yours. My enemies can find plenty to say about me--but never that I have been false to a friend. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> keep me <b>always</b> at arm's length, as though I were one of those who wished you evil?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Leyla (Melis Birkan): The {{last major}} Leyla in the series, who appears in season three, most closely resembles the {{original}} Leyla. Like the first Leyla, Mecnun {{falls in love}} with her when he sees her {{at the top of the}} stairs. Leyla is a businesswoman, and Mecnun's constant presence sabotages her company; once, he starts a fire. When Leyla criticizes him one day, Meclun says: [...] "What are <b>you</b> <b>doing?</b> <b>Why</b> are <b>you</b> <b>always</b> criticizing me? <b>Why</b> are <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>doing</b> this? For once, turn around and look at yourself. Maybe you are to blame, huh? Maybe you are just not good enough. Maybe you are not made for this job. If <b>you</b> can't <b>do</b> this job, then don't. Stop!" [...] Leyla tries to slap him, Mecnun gently grabs her hand and they gaze into each other's eyes.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no, Mameena, 'the Waiting Wind,' {{has blown}} over her fame, {{so why should}} you know of {{one who has been}} dead a long while? <b>Why</b> also, Macumazahn, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> bring women into every business? I begin to believe that {{although}} you are so strict in a white man's fashion, you must be too fond of them, a weakness which makes for ruin to any man. Well, now, I think that this wolf-man, this axe-man, this warrior, Umslopogaas should be a good fellow to you on your journey to visit the white witch, Queen--another woman by the way, Macumazahn, and therefore one of whom you should be careful. Oh! yes, he will come with you--because of a man called Lousta and a woman named Monazi, a wife of his who hates him and does--not hate Lousta. I am almost sure that he will come with <b>you,</b> so <b>do</b> not stop to ask questions about him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How could his virtues reflect {{any credit}} on me?" [...] Geraldine retorted. [...] "Besides, your cynicism is assumed. I don't believe you ever took a dollar {{you were not}} {{entitled}} to. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> make a joke of things?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it must {{be because}} there is some other woman whom you wish to gain. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> wear that strange necklace?" [...] she added sharply. [...] "Did it belong to this savage girl Iduna, as, {{from the look of}} it, it might well have done?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is no such}} person," [...] {{retorted}} Susan. [...] "As for {{the military}} critics, {{they do not know}} one blessed thing about it, any more than you or I. They have been mistaken times out of number. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> look on the dark side, Sophia Crawford?" ...|$|E
6000|$|When I {{first had}} the privilege—and I count {{it a very}} high one—of meeting Mr. Walter Pater, he said to me, smiling, ‘Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> write poetry? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> not write prose? Prose {{is so much more}} difficult.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> {{understand}} <b>why</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> everything? Ought one to understand? People like {{my mother}} understand," [...] she reflected. [...] "Now I must go down to them, I suppose, and see what's happening." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why so? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> say it? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> torment me? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> banish me at once, {{and tell}} me that I must go home a wretched, miserable man? Why?--why?--why? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] he cried, [...] "my dear! <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> {{want to turn}} love into--touches?... Stand up again. Stand up there, my dear; don't think I've {{ceased to}} love you, but stand up there and {{let me talk to}} you as one man to another. If we let this {{occasion}} slide to embraces...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle Joe, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> {{look as if}} {{you were}} just going down into the grave, when you meet a person on the street?"--and then went on to reveal to him the funereal {{spectacle}} which he presented on such occasions. Well, she has met Twichell three times since then, and would swim the Connecticut to avoid meeting him the fourth. As soon as he sights her, no matter how public the place nor how far off she is, he makes a bound into the air, heaves arms and legs into all sorts of frantic gestures of delight, and so comes prancing, skipping and pirouetting for her like a drunken Indian entering heaven.|$|E
6000|$|... "On a base {{as broad}} as the pyramids {{of which you}} were talking at dinner. Public report, not nearly so {{misleading}} a guide as people think, your face, your voice, your eyes, all betray you. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> try to get near him to touch him?--answer me that. I have seen you do it three times this evening. Once you handed him a book in order to touch his hand beneath it; {{but there is no}} need to enumerate what you doubtless very well remember. No nice woman, Mrs. Carr, ever likes to continually touch a man unless she loves him. You are always listening for his voice and step, you are listening for them now. Your eyes follow his face as a dog does his master's--when you speak to him, your voice is a caress in itself. Shall I go on?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> {{bring me}} down into that room," [...] I asked, [...] "under a false pretence? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> use that murderous cane of mine for your crime? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> insist upon it that I {{should be seen}} dining with the girl--God knows who she is!--who is in that room?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Willy," [...] she cried, [...] "what <b>does</b> this mean? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{treat me}} in this way when I come home after having been away so long, and having {{suffered}} so much? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> greet me as if you took me for a tax collector? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> stand there like a--a horrible clam?" ...|$|R
3000|$|<b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> need {{to fight}} it now? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> {{need to go to}} that {{destructive}} system instead of giving yourself the freedom to feel? [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "I want to," [...] said my uncle. [...] "But {{why do you}} try {{and hide}} your taste under these mere formalities in frames? <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> say 'I pass' {{in the game of}} decoration? Better a mess of green amateurs and love therewith, than the richest autotypes and dull complacency. Have what you like. There {{is no such thing as}} {{absolute}} beauty. That is the Magna Charta of the world of art. What is beautiful to me is not beautiful to another man, in art as in women. But take care to get the art that fits you. Frankly, that 'Love and Death' suits you, Bagshot, about as much as a purple toga would. Orchardson is in your style. I tell you that the greengrocer who buys an original oil painting for sixteen shillings with frame complete is far nearer artistic salvation than the patron of the popular autotype. Surely you will wake up presently, Bagshot, and wonder what you have been about.|$|E
6000|$|At daybreak, {{even before}} the sun was up, the woman came and woke the two children: [...] "Get up, you lie-abeds, we're all going to the forest to fetch wood." [...] She gave them each a bit of bread and said: [...] "There's {{something}} for your luncheon, but don't you eat it up before, for it's all you'll get." [...] Grettel took the bread under her apron, as Hansel had the stones in his pocket. Then they all set out together {{on the way to}} the forest. After they had walked for a little, Hansel stood still and looked back at the house, and this maneuver he repeated again and again. His father observed him, and said: [...] "Hansel, what are you gazing at there, and <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> remain behind? Take care, and don't lose your footing." [...] "Oh! father," [...] said Hansel, [...] "I am looking back at my white kitten, which is sitting on the roof, waving me a farewell." [...] The woman exclaimed: [...] "What a donkey you are! that isn't your kitten, that's the morning sun shining on the chimney." [...] But Hansel had not looked back at his kitten, but had always dropped one of the white pebbles out of his pocket on to the path.|$|E
5000|$|... ¡¿Por qué siempre me {{tienes que}} meter a Manolo en todas partes?! (<b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> have to mention Manolo?!) ...|$|E
60|$|GERALD. Yes, {{something}} like that. I say, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> come, Anabel? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> come slap-bang {{into the middle}} of us?--It's not expostulation--I want to know.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think him mad, sir?' {{said his}} master, {{speaking}} in a peevish tone. 'Don't use that word too freely. <b>Why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think him mad?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why was I never told? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> deceive me? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> tell me {{that this}} child had died {{a few days after}} birth? Why, Therese? Why?" ...|$|R
50|$|Oh, {{you mind}} ! <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> steeped in thoughts. Do not engage {{yourself}} in the duality of thoughts. Give up this duality. I ask {{you to listen to}} the inner voice of God in you. Always think of God with a relaxed mind, and, as you very well know, He always extends His supportive hand to those, who need it.|$|E
5000|$|Angela seeks {{forgiveness}} from Regina {{after the}} revelation that she disclosed information to Bossman due to the pain she felt when Major Egan rejected her advances. She advices Regina to go to Nigeria to meet Major Egan if she's truly in love with him. In Nigeria, Col. Bello sends soldiers to assassinate Major Egan and make it appear as suicide. A gas cylinder was opened by the assassinator who revealed the death wish of Major Egan and told him Col. Bello was responsible. As the sergeant was leaving the house, stating on phone, [...] "I have sent him to hell this time" [...] with a bomb timer in his hands, Regina surfaced to save Major Egan {{for the second time}} saying, <b>why</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> get yourself in death situations?.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, Amory, <b>why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> come? <b>Why</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> come, Amory? Oh, I think I {{could have}} borne anything, {{but if they}} hurt you I could not bear that." ...|$|R
