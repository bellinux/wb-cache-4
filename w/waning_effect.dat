40|$|The {{prevailing}} {{definition of}} a hospital readmission is a hospital admission that occurs within a specified time frame after discharge from the first or index admission. This definition may be questionable for studies with long or indefinite time frames during which the effect of interventions in the index admis-sion will likely wane, making it less appropriate to classify a later hospitalization as a readmission. The current study proposes an alternative definition of readmission and compares the new definition to the traditional one. The comparison shows that the new method is more conceptually correct because it {{takes into account the}} <b>waning</b> <b>effect</b> of the index admission. It can identify readmissions regardless of when they occur. It increases a readmission sample size and thus statistical power. (Am J Med Qual 2007; 22 : 98 - 102...|$|E

In order to monitor successful vaccination, chemiluminescent method is used to determine quantitatively HBsAb in the serum.

40|$|Whether the {{protection}} afforded by a vaccine wanes {{over time and}} if so, by how much, are important public health questions with implications for mass immunization programs. However, the measurement of such effects is fraught with difficulties. Generally, clinical trials are too short to provide evidence on <b>waning</b> <b>effects.</b> Thus {{it is necessary to}} rely on epidemiologic data, which are subject to ascertainment bias. Furthermore, standard epidemiologic measures, such as hazard ratios, may not accurately reflect <b>waning</b> <b>effects.</b> We develop two models of waning vaccine efficacy, the selection and deterioration models. In the selection model, waning arises from heterogeneity in the duration of protection. In the deterioration model, the hazard ratio of infection in vaccinated individuals relative to unvaccinated individuals increases with time. The two models are the with-waning analogs of the previously defined "all or nothing" and "leaky" models. Likelihood functions based on these models are obtained for cohort and case-report data, as typically collected in surveillance studies of vaccine efficacy. These likelihood functions involve three groups of parameters, corresponding to the hazard of infection, vaccine efficacy (possibly including <b>waning</b> <b>effects),</b> and ascertainment of infections. Our strategy is to fit a range of models incorporating a variety of assumptions about the vaccine efficacy model, ascertainment bias, and age dependence of the hazard. If allowing for waning improves the fit of the model under a range of scenarios, then we infer that it is a genuine effect. We apply the methods to two sets of data on whooping cough vaccine efficacy in the United Kingdom...|$|R

Induction: The risk of a patient recovering consciousness while still paralyzed is greater if an ultrashort-acting intravenous anaesthetic is used. The time interval necessary before surgery may begin is governed by the need to build up a sufficient concentration of inhalation agent to take over from the <b>waning</b> <b>effect</b> of the intravenous agent Maintenance: Three sources of trouble are distinguished, each leading to the patient receiving an anaesthetic mixture less potent than intended. (1) Ventilators may rniy air or oxygen with the anaesthetic gas if they are not adjusted properly or if there are leaks. Ventilators are classified according to their propensities for doing this. (2) Some anaesthetic machines have pitfalls. (3) A circle system is shown to need time to acquire an adequate concentration of anaesthetic.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the efficacy of}} a depot preparation of growth hormone (GH) in a 15 % gelatin solution (GH-gel) {{in the treatment of}} 15 growth hormone-deficient children. The studies were designed to see if prolonging absorption of GH to achieve lower more physiological concentrations of GH in plasma would decrease the frequency of injection, reduce the amount of GH needed for effective therapeutic response, and improve the response to long-term treatment. We found that after a single dose of GH-gel the plasma concentrations of GH were lower than those achieved after the standard aqueous preparation. The preparation was efficacious in promoting growth and our 1 st study of 6 patients suggested that GH-gel given twice a week had a growth response equal to that of the three-times a week aqueous schedule. However both schedules resulted in the frequently observed decreased growth rate during the second treatment year. Our 2 nd study, attempting to ameliorate this <b>waning</b> <b>effect</b> by using the GH-gel preparation twice a week in a weight-adjusted dose during the entire second year did not resolve the problem.

40|$|The <b>waning</b> <b>effect</b> of neuromuscular {{blocking}} agents {{towards the}} end of surgery often necessi-tates the addition of a further increment of blocker. When a longer acting agent (e. g. tubo-curarine or pancuronium) is used, this additional increment may delay recovery [1]. Atracurium and vecuronium, the two intermediate acting agents, may be used for longer surgical pro-cedures, although repeated bolus administration or continous infusion is required [2, 3]. It would seem logical to use a longer acting agent to produce initial neuromuscular block and to use atracurium or vecuronium if extension of the block is needed. This technique is satisfactory with pancuronium and vecuronium [4], but no data are available for the other agents. We have therefore examined the effect of atracurium and vecuronium when given to supplement an existing neuromuscular block produced by tubocurarine.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{abundance}} of mica {{has been used}} to determine the energy levels of the depositional environments of the Indus River/ Estuary in terms of the interactions between the river currents and tidal, wind and wave induced currents. Three distinct zones have been identified on the basis of sediment texture and mica content. Based on textural class, the Indus River/Estuary along the 40 km stretch up-stream is subdivided into three distinct classes: sandy silt, silty clay and sand silt clay. The textural data demonstrate the hydraulic associ-ation of mica with finer sediments. The excess presence of mica in ar-eas of fine sediment and its relative abundance in coarser sediments have been used to identify the boundaries between the three zones which are classified into environments of high-medium-low energy. Marine processes in the lower reaches (mouth) of the Indus River are responsible for winnowing of finer sediments, leaving coarser materi-als as lag deposits. However, the presence of coarser sediments in the upper limits shows the incompetency of the river flow to transport material and the <b>waning</b> <b>effects</b> of wave and wind generated currents on the depositional regime. The presence of abundant mica within mud is attributed to flocculation induced by the mixing of fresh and saline waters and the limit of tidal intrusion. Mica dominates in the mud and mimics the depositional characteristics of clay. The distribu-tion of mica and sediment texture suggest that sedimentation is con-trolled primarily by different energy levels, flocculation, and by prov-enance (metamorphic rocks in the Himalayan range) ...|$|R

30|$|These results {{pertain to}} the part of study 2 {{including}} baseline, 10 min of loading dose and 18 min of the following maintenance epoch. The marked bradycardic effect of the bolus dose is clear both at the individual and group level (increasing mean RR, decreasing mean HR). Bradycardia levels stabilize during maintenance. As the system is clearly migrating to a different state during loading, HRV (Var RR, Var HR, and ppLF) increases relevantly in the initial minutes and then tends to reach minimum levels {{by the end of}} the loading dose. On the other hand, ppHF increases at the start of administration and stays elevated for the entire 10 min of loading. As a consequence, the sympathovagal balance steadily decreases to minimum levels up to the end of the loading phase. The switch in balance during the maintenance period, along with HRV remaining at low levels, is quite probably due to the respiratory <b>waning</b> <b>effect</b> (not reportable for all subjects, see previous section for exemplary cases). Of note, the individual is losing consciousness at minute 8 of the loading epoch, regaining intermittent responsiveness from minute 11 after loading starts, whereas the average range of loss of consciousness for the group goes between 7 to 12 min after loading starts. Importantly, sharp increases in IDLE values can be observed around the range of loss of consciousness both for the individual and the group dynamics.|$|E
40|$|From an {{original}} prospective cohort of 244 current and ex-workers in two asbestos cement plants, longitudinal radiographic data covering ten years {{were available for}} 165 and lung function data covering about six years for 150. Estimates of average and cumulative dust exposure were available for each participant, all men. Radiographic progression (onset or worsening) was assessed by comparing earliest and latest films side by side. Annual changes in lung function were computed by fitting regression lines to all the data points. Small opacities (ILO category 1 / 0 or higher) were found in 16 % of initial films, and progression of small opacities occurred in 13 % of film pairs. Average and cumulative dust exposure were each significant determinants of the initial presence of small opacities, and were determinants of the progression of both parenchymal and pleural abnormalities. There was greater likelihood of progression if an abnormality was initially present, and a greater likelihood of progression in the plant that had systematic use of some crocidolite. Initial levels of lung function were related to smoking, exposure to dust, and initial radiographic status. Mean annual declines in lung function were modest (FVC- 0. 017 l/y, FEV 1 - 0. 020 l/y) and were related to smoking but not exposure to dust, initial radiographic status, or radiographic progression. Both plants used mainly chrysotile asbestos and exposure levels declined severalfold after 1960. Our findings suggest a <b>waning</b> <b>effect</b> of the larger remote dust exposures on recent annual change in lung function. This accords with human and experimental pathology data showing the relatively low resistance of chrysotile fibres to chemical alteration and clearance...|$|E
40|$|Background: Published {{economic}} {{assessments of}} rotavirus vaccination typically use modelling, mainly static Markov cohort models with birth cohorts followed {{up to the}} age of 5 years. Rotavirus vaccination has now been available for several years in some countries, and data have been collected to evaluate the real-world impact of vaccination on rotavirus hospitalisations. This study compared the economic impact of vaccination between model estimates and observed data on disease-specific hospitalisation reductions in a country for which both modelled and observed datasets exist (Belgium). Methods: A previously published Markov cohort model estimated the impact of rotavirus vaccination on the number of rotavirus hospitalisations in children aged < 5 years in Belgium using vaccine efficacy data from clinical development trials. Data on the number of rotavirus-positive gastroenteritis hospitalisations in children aged < 5 years between 1 June 2004 and 31 May 2006 (pre-vaccination study period) or 1 June 2007 to 31 May 2010 (post-vaccination study period) were analysed from nine hospitals in Belgium and compared with the modelled estimates. Results: The model predicted a smaller decrease in hospitalisations over time, mainly explained by two factors. First, the observed data indicated indirect vaccine protection in children too old or too young for vaccination. This herd effect is difficult to capture in static Markov cohort models and therefore {{was not included in the}} model. Second, the model included a 'waning' effect, i. e. reduced vaccine effectiveness over time. The observed data suggested this <b>waning</b> <b>effect</b> did not occur during that period, and so the model systematically underestimated vaccine effectiveness during the first 4 years after vaccine implementation. Conclusions: Model predictions underestimated the direct medical economic value of rotavirus vaccination during the first 4 years of vaccination by approximately 10 % when assessing hospitalisation rates as compared with observed data in Belgium...|$|E

30|$|In {{the results}} from the first {{experimental}} study, we show that PROP signatures are initially (first two administration levels) characterized by a marked decrease in HRV, both in LF and HF, confirming previous findings, and pointing at a general loss of autonomic tone (both sympathetic and vagal) possibly connected with simultaneous baroreflex deactivation/resetting. The observed delayed compensatory variations of HRV can be attributed to sympathetic activation due to vasodilatory effect, as well as vagal activation due to intermittent phenylephrine administration. Vagal predominance is observed during loss of consciousness. Our comparison between individual signatures and signatures obtained from all subjects demonstrates that overall trends, devoid of fast transient effect present on individual dynamics, can be observed particularly in normalized measures. Most importantly, increased IDLE complex dynamics elicited by increasing drug administration levels are highly correlated with the hypnotic effect (as measured by auditory test and confirmed by EEG metrics) for the individual and with the level of administration for the group signature. In {{the results from}} the second experimental study, we show that DMED signatures are characterized by a marked sympathetic deactivation and by sustained vagal activation, clearly visible in HRV dynamics during the first loading stage, so less during maintenance levels, where respiration <b>waning</b> <b>effects</b> are more predominant. Importantly, the IDLE complex dynamic increases in accordance with the incidence of loss of consciousness (predominantly during the initial bolus administration). The reduced hypnotic effect compared with PROP (also demonstrated by EEG signatures) is also confirmed by relatively low IDLE levels during maintenance. Although we do not provide p values from statistical inference tests (because of the reduced number of subjects involved in the study), we show consistent trends in all the linear and nonlinear heartbeat features (see Figures 4 and 5) and, thus, provide important insights to the different cardiovascular dynamics during anesthesia and sedation as shown in an instantaneous fashion.|$|R
40|$|Background In 2011, Kenya {{introduced}} the 10 -valent {{pneumococcal conjugate vaccine}} together with a catch-up campaign for children aged < 5 years in Kilifi County. In a post-vaccination surveillance study based in Kilifi, there was a substantial decline in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). However, given the continued circulation of the vaccine serotypes {{it is possible that}} vaccine-serotype disease may re-emerge once the effects of the catch-up campaign wear off. Methods We developed a compartmental, age-structured dynamic model of pneumococcal carriage and invasive disease for three serotype groups: the 10 -valent vaccine serotypes and two groups of non-vaccine serotypes based on their susceptibility to mutual competition. The model was calibrated to age- and serotype-specific data on carriage and IPD in the pre-vaccination era and used to predict carriage prevalence and IPD up to ten years post-vaccination in Kilifi. The model was validated against the observed carriage prevalence after vaccine introduction. Results The model predicts a sustained reduction in vaccine-type pneumococcal carriage prevalence from 33 % to 8 % in infants and from 30 % to 8 % in 1 – 5 year olds over the 10 -year period following vaccine introduction. The incidence of IPD is predicted to decline across all age groups resulting in an overall reduction of 56 % in the population, corresponding to 10. 4 cases per 100, 000 per year. The vaccine-type IPD incidence is estimated to decline by 83 % while non-vaccine-type IPD incidence is predicted to increase by 52 %. The model's predictions of carriage prevalence agrees well with the observed data in the first five years post-vaccination. Conclusion We predict a sustained and substantial decline in IPD through PCV vaccination and that the current regimen is insufficient to fully eliminate vaccine-serotype circulation in the model. We show that the observed impact is likely to be sustained despite <b>waning</b> <b>effects</b> of the catch-up campaign...|$|R
40|$|According {{to recent}} models, the {{accretion}} disk and {{black hole in}} active galactic nuclei are surrounded by a clumpy torus. We investigate the NIR flux variation of the torus {{in response to a}} UV flash for various geometries. Anisotropic illumination by the disk and the torus self-occultation contrast our study with earlier works. Both the <b>waning</b> <b>effect</b> of each clump and the torus self-occultation selectively reduce the emission from the region with a short delay. Therefore, the NIR delay depends on the viewing angle (where a more inclined angle leads to a longer delay) and the time response shows an asymmetric profile with a negative skewness, opposing to the results for optically thin tori. The range of the computed delay coincides with the observed one, suggesting that the viewing angle is primarily responsible for the scatter of the observed delay. We also propose that the red NIR-to-optical color of type- 1. 8 / 1. 9 objects is caused by not only the dust extinction but also the intrinsically red color. Compared with the modest torus thickness, both a thick and a thin tori display the weaker NIR emission. A selection bias is thus expected such that NIR-selected AGNs tend to possess moderately thick tori. A thicker torus shows a narrower and more heavily skewed time profile, while a thin torus produces a rapid response. A super-Eddington accretion rate leads to a much weaker NIR emission due to the disk self-occultation and the disk truncation by the self-gravity. A long delay is expected from an optically thin and/or a largely misaligned torus. A very weak NIR emission, such as in hot-dust-poor active nuclei, can arise from a geometrically thin torus, a super-Eddington accretion rate or a slightly misaligned torus.

40|$|In most {{countries}} of sub-Saharan Africa {{the control of}} lymphatic filariasis (LF) is based on annual mass drug administration (MDA) {{with a combination of}} ivermectin and albendazole, in order to interrupt transmission. Here we present the first detailed study on the effect of 3 repeated MDAs with this drug combination, as implemented by the Tanzanian National Lymphatic Filariasis Elimination Programme (NLFEP). Infection and transmission was monitored during a five-year period (one pre-intervention and four post-intervention years) in a highly endemic community (Kirare village) in north-eastern Tanzania. The vectors were Anopheles gambiae, An. funestus and Cx. quinquefasciatus. After start of intervention, human microfilaraemia initially decreased rapidly and statistically significant (prevalence by 21. 2 % and 40. 4 %, and mean intensity by 48. 4 % and 73. 7 %, compared to pre-treatment values after the first and second MDA, respectively), but thereafter the effect levelled off. The initial decrease in microfilaraemia led to significant decreases in vector infection and vector infectivity rates and thus to a considerable reduction in transmission (by 74. 3 % and 91. 3 % compared to pre-treatment level after first and second MDA, respectively). However, the decrease in infection and infectivity rates subsequently also levelled off, and low-level transmission was still noted after the third MDA. The MDAs had limited effect on circulating filarial antigens and antibody response to Bm 14. Critical issues that may potentially explain the observed <b>waning</b> <b>effect</b> of the MDAs in the later study period include the long intervals between MDAs and a lower than optimal treatment coverage. The findings highlight the importance of ongoing surveillance for monitoring the progress of LF control programmes, and it calls for more research into the long-term effect of repeated ivermectin/albendazole MDAs (including the significance of treatment intervals and compliance), in order to optimize efforts to control LF in sub-Saharan Africa...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} {{investigates the}} effect of leniency clause on cartel formation and self-reporting by firms in an asymmetric cartel. The notion of asymmetric is used in terms of different market share of the firms, which form a cartel. This setting is used to bring the experimental design closer to reality. We experimentally controlled for ‘Provision of Deal’- when a firm with larger market share can offer some side payments to the firms with smaller market share and induce them not to report. We run three treatments: 1) Leniency without Deal (LWOD), 2) Leniency with Deal (LWD) and 3) Reward with Deal (RWD). In LWOD treatment players can come forward and self-report their communication to the authority. In LWD treatment before self-reporting there is another step where big players can transfer 10 points to the small player and induce them not to report. In RWD treatment players earn 25 points if they report, unlike LWD or LWOD where they paid some amount after reporting as well. The results of the experiment demonstrate {{that there is no}} notable difference in the formation of cartels among the three treatments. However, cartel members see the adverse effect of the provision of a deal on the self-reporting of cartels. The incidence of reporting falls significantly from 61. 48 % in Leniency without Deal treatment to 25. 86 % in Leniency with Deal treatment. Further, giving positive rewards to the self-reporters counteract {{the effect of}} the deal to a large extent. Thus, reporting is remarkably high at 41. 44 % in Reward with Deal treatment as compared to 25. 86 % in Leniency with Deal treatment.

A 13 -valent {{pneumococcal conjugate vaccine}} (PCV 13) was approved for protection against invasive disease and pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in adults. This study estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of vaccinating COPD patients C 50 years old with PCV 13 comparedwith current vaccination policy (CVP) with 23 -valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. Methods A Markov model accounting for the risks and costs for all-cause non-bacteremic pneumonia (NBP) and invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) was developed. All parameters, such as disease incidence and costs (€; 2015 values), were based on published data. The perspective of the analysis was that of the Spanish National Healthcare System, and the horizon of evaluation was lifetime in the base case. Vaccine effectiveness considered <b>waning</b> <b>effect</b> over time. Outcomes and costs were both discounted by 3 % annually. Results Over a lifetime horizon and for a 629, 747 COPD total population, PCV 13 would prevent 2224 cases of inpatient NBP, 3134 cases of outpatientNBP, and 210 IPDextra cases in comparisonwith CVP. Additionally, 398 related deaths would be averted. The ICERwas € 1518 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained for PCV 13 versus CVP. PCV 13 was found to be cost effective versus CVP from a 5 -year modelling horizon (1302 inpatient NBP and 1835 outpatient NBP cases together with 182 deaths would be prevented [ICER € 25, 573 /QALY]). Univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the model.

No clear data concerning the incidence, the diagnostic accuracy and the long-term growth response to GH therapy have been reported till now. Out of 700 short patients with a GH deficiency-like phenotype but normal GH secretion, we selected 12 prepubertal children (8 M, 4 F) showing normal/high serum peak GH levels measured by commercial kits (IFMA) in contrast with a reduced GH activity evaluated by Nb 2 proliferation assay, and marked increase in serum IGF-I values during somatomedin generation test (0. 1 IU/Kg/day per 4 days). The children’s mean chronological age was 10. 59 yrs, bone age 7. 75 yrs, height – 2. 74 SDS, and growth rate – 2. 13 SDS. In the same period, we evaluated 15 age-matched GHD prepubertal children (11 M, 4 F) with similar auxological criteria and complete GH deficiency (serum GH peak < 5 ng/ml). The median area under the curve (AUC) of bioactivity/immunoactivity ratio was significantly lower in bioinactive than GHD children (6. 30 vs. 32. 3, p< 0. 001) indicating a lower biological activity of GH.

40|$|Forty prepubertal {{subjects}} (25 {{boys and}} 15 girls) with idiopathic short stature, aged 3. 8 – 14. 6 yr, were randomly allocated to receive sc injections of recombinant human GH (hGH) 6 days/week at {{a dose of}} 3 IU (1. 25 mg) /m 2 -day either {{in the morning or}} in the evening. After 6 months of therapy, each subject was switched over to the other schedule of injection. After 12 months, treatment was stopped, and the subjects were followed for 6 months. For the whole group, regardless of the time of injection, height velocity (centimeters per yr) was 4. 3 ± 0. 9 before hGH treatment, 8. 3 ± 1. 9 during the first 6 months of treatment, and 6. 9 ± 1. 6 during the last 6 months of treatment. Thirty-three of 38 subjects (87 %) who completed 12 months of therapy presented an increase in height velocity greater than 2 cm/yr. Two patients (5 %) developed antibodies to hGH and were among the nonresponders. There {{was no significant difference in}} growth response according to the schedule of injections. GH-releasing hormone (GHRH) testing was performed before and after 6 and 12 months of hGH therapy. When the last hGH injection was performed 12 h before the GHRH test, there was a 36 % decrease in the maximum GH response (P < 0. 01) and a 33 % decrease (P < 0. 01) in the GH secretory area compared to those before therapy. When the last hGH injection was performed 24 h or more before the GHRH test, no significant differences were observed. Insulin-like growth factor-I levels were not significantly different when measured 12 or 24 h after hGH. During the 6 months after discontinuation of hGH therapy, catch-down growth was observed in 44 % of the subjects. We conclude that the schedule of injection does not influence the growth response, which wanes after 6 months; this <b>waning</b> <b>effect</b> is not related to declining insulin-like growth factor-I levels or GH autofeedback, suggesting a peripheral mechanism. Likewise, the catch-down phenomenon after hGH is discontinued is not related to a persistent diminution of pituitary responsiveness to GHRH. © 1991 by The Endocrine Society.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} new {{empirical evidence}} on the long-run efficiency of locally targeted tax incentives in revitalizing distressed areas. We focus on {{the first generation of}} the French "Enterprise Zone" (EZ) initiative, implemented in 1997 in continental France. This program provides tax incentives to firms located in designated areas plagued by social and economic difficulties. Compared to EZs in the US and the UK, French Enterprise Zones offer generous tax reductions, but these subsidies are limited to small firms with less than fifty employees. To our knowledge, the first generation of French EZs has not yet been evaluated on a national scale. A very rich georeferenced panel dataset is used to identify the impact of the EZ policy. Our identification strategy relies on the selection mechanism employed by the French government: designated EZs were selected according to a deprivation index based on various socio-economic criteria. Besides, in order to qualify as an EZ, an urban area must have a population of over 10, 000. Consequently, a pool of deprived urban areas was left untreated because of this threshold whereas it was similar to selected areas in terms of economic development. We use two different empirical methods: a combination of regression and sub-classification on the propensity score, and a regression discontinuity design method. Both methods yield similar results. We highlight a strong positive impact of this policy on employment and business location during {{the first years of the}} policy. Detailed estimates moderate this initial favourable assessment. First, the EZ effect is partially offset after the initial five-year period of full tax exemptions by more frequent business discontinuations. We simulate actual tax reliefs at a firm-level at the beginning of the policy and ten years after in order to explain this <b>waning</b> <b>effect.</b> We highlight the fact that the introduction of generous payroll tax deductions at a national scale in 2003 reduced the attractiveness of targeted areas. Second, while firms already operating also benefit from tax exemptions, no significant impact on their employment level can be detected. Besides, this policy promotes sectors of activity that weakly stimulate local employment and development. Overall, these results suggest that firms are sensitive to tax cuts but call into question the capacity of EZs to improve local economy...|$|E

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: In Uganda, cattle are an {{important}} reservoir of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, a parasite that causes human African trypanosomiasis or sleeping sickness. We developed mathematical models to examine the transmission of T. b. rhodesiense by tsetse vector species, Glossina fuscipes fuscipes in a host population that consists of humans, domestic and wild mammals, and reptiles. The models were developed and analysed based {{on the situation in}} Tororo district in Southeastern Uganda, where sleeping sickness is endemic and which has a cattle and human population of 40, 000 and 500, 000, respectively. Assuming populations of cattle and humans only, the impact of mass chemoprophylaxis and vector control through insecticide-treated cattle (ITC) is evaluated. Keeping 12 % or 82 % of the cattle population on insecticides that have an insecticidal killing effect of 100 % at all times or trypanocides that have 100 % efficacy, respectively, can lead to the control of T. b. rhodesiense in both humans and cattle. Optimal control of T. b. rhodesiense is shown to be achieved through ITC alone or a combination of chemoprophylaxis and ITC, the former being the cheapest control strategy. Allowing for the <b>waning</b> <b>effect</b> of insecticides and including wildhosts, T. b. rhodesiense control can be achieved by keeping 21 % or 27 % of the cattle population on insecticides through whole-body or restricted application, respectively. Restricting the treatment of insecticides to adult cattle only would require 24 % or 33 % of the adult cattle population to be kept on insecticides through whole-body or restricted application, respectively, to control T. b. rhodesiense. A cost-effectiveness and benefit-cost analysis of using ITC to control T. b. rhodesiense show that restricted application of insecticides is a cheaper and more beneficial strategy compared to whole-body treatment. The results of the study show that the restricted application of insecticides on cattle provides a cheap, safe and farmer-based strategy for controlling tsetse and trypanosomiasis. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: In Uganda is beeste ’n belangrike reservoir van Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, ’n parasiet wat tripanosomiase of slaapsiekte in mense veroorsaak. Ons het wiskundige modelle ontwikkel wat die oordrag van T. b. Rhodesiense deur tesetse vektor spesies, Glossina fuscipes fuscipes in ’n draer populasie wat bestaan uit mense, mak en wilde diere en reptiele, ondersoek. Die modelle was ontwikkel en geanaliseer gebaseer op die oordrag situasie in die Tororo distrik in Suidoostelike Uganda, ’n gebied waar slaapsiekte endemies is en wat ’n populasie van 40, 000 beeste en 500, 000 mense het. Die impak van massa chemoprofilakse en vektor beheer deur insekdoder-behandelde beeste is gevalueer onder die aanname van bees en mens populasies alleenlik. Beheer oor T. b. Rhodesiense in beide mense en beeste kan verkry word deur of 12 % van die bees populasie te behandel met ’n insekdoder wat 100 % effektief is ten alle tye of 82 % van die bees populasie te behandel met tripanosiedes wat 100 % effektief is. Daar is aangetoon dat optimale beheer van T. b. Rhodesiense bereik kan word deur die gebruik van insekdoders alleenlik of ’n kombinasie van insekdoders en chemoprofilakse, hoewel eersgenoemde die goedkoopste strategie is. Wanneer die kwynende effek van insekdoders asook wilde diere as draers in ag geneem word, kan T. b. Rhodesiense beheer verkry word deur 21 % van beeste se hele liggaam met insekdoders te behandel of 27 % gedeeltelik te behandel. As slegs volwasse beeste met insekdoders behandel word, moet 24 % se hele liggaam of 33 % gedeeltelik behandel word vir beheer van T. b. Rhodesiense. ’n Koste-effektiwiteit en voordeel-koste analise van insekdoders as beheermaatstaf vir T. b. Rhodesiense toon aan dat gedeeltelike behandeling van die bees se liggaam die goedkoper en meer voordelige strategie is in vergelyking met behandeling van die hele liggaam. Die resultate van die studie wys dat gedeeltelike behandeling van beeste met insekdoders ’n goedkoop, veilige en landbouer-gebaseerde strategie is om tsetse en tripanosomiase te beheer...|$|E
40|$|Year-end edition, Vol. 7, No. 2. The HIV/AIDS {{surveillance}} {{data in this}} report characterize the populations affected by HIV-related illness and death and provide a current profile of HIV/AIDS at the national level. The epidemic 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s impact on the nation 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s health was highlighted during 1995, when the cumulative number of reported AIDS cases surpassed one-half million. Of 513, 486 persons with AIDS reported through December 1995, over 62 percent have died. Among persons ages 25 to 44 years, HIV infection is now {{the leading cause of}} death in men and the third leading cause in women. As expected, the number of cases reported during 1995 (74, 180) was lower than the numbers reported during 1994 (79, 897, Table 1) and 1993 (105, 828), reflecting the <b>waning</b> <b>effect</b> of the expanded 1993 AIDS surveillance case definition. However, in 1995 the number of cases reported was 56 percent higher than in 1992 (47, 453), before the case definition was expanded. Because the numbers of cases reported annually during the period 1992 through 1995 have fluctuated, and because persons reported with AIDS during a calendar year had AIDS diagnosed during that year or prior years, CDC has developed statistical methods to examine temporal trends in the epidemic (see Technical Notes). These methods estimate the incidence of AIDS opportunistic illnesses (AIDS-OIs) by taking into account the change in the case definition and lags in reporting of cases to CDC. Results show that from 1992 through 1994, the estimated incidence of AIDS-OIs increased by 8 percent overall. Trends in the incidence of AIDS-OIs varied by region, race/ethnicity, sex, and mode of exposure (Tables 18, 19, 20). From 1992 through 1994, the incidence of AIDS-OIs increased in the South (13 percent) and the Northeast (11 percent), and among blacks (17 percent), Hispanics (13 percent), men (5 percent), and women (26 percent). Increases also occurred among Asians/Pacific Islanders and American Indians/Alaska Natives; however, these populations each account for less than 1 percent of estimated AIDS-OIs. By mode of HIV exposure, the largest increases occurred among heterosexual men and women who acquired HIV through injecting drug use (men 11 percent; women 12 percent) or through heterosexual contact (men 38 percent; women 46 percent). Although the incidence of estimated AIDS-OIs is increasing most rapidly among persons infected heterosexually, men who have sex with men continue to represent the largest number and proportion of persons estimated to have AIDS-OIs. The demographic characteristics, behavioral risks, and geographic distribution of persons with AIDS reported during 1995 reflect shifts in the populations at risk for HIV/ AIDS, most notably the changing racial/ethnic profile shown on the cover of this report. The cover illustrates a shift in the epidemic from whites to minorities, especially blacks and Hispanics. In 1995, for the first time, the proportion of persons reported with AIDS who are black was equal to the proportion who are white (40 percent). In 1995, blacks and Hispanics represented the majority of cases among men (54 percent) and women (76 percent). The reported AIDS incidence rate per 100, 000 among blacks (92. 6) was 6 times higher than that among whites (15. 4) and 2 times higher than that among Hispanics (46. 2). Rates were lowest among American Indians/ Alaska Natives (12. 3) and Asians/Pacific Islanders (6. 2). However, HIV/AIDS {{surveillance data}} collected from medical records do not include measures of socioeconomic status such as education and income that may more accurately predict risk of HIV than demographic factors such as race/ethnicity. Case report information obtained by health care providers through routine patient history-taking may include one or more risk behaviors or potential modes of exposure to HIV (Table 17). Efforts to prevent HIV infections through community-based prevention programs are enhanced by knowledge of HIV risk behaviors in the local community. Most adults/adolescents reported with AIDS have risk information recorded (93 percent, Table 3). Although persons most recently reported with AIDS are more likely to have unreported risk information because medical record reviews are incomplete or pending, most persons are ultimately identified as having a recognized risk factor (Figure 7). HIV reports provide a minimum estimate of the number and characteristics of persons in the community who have been tested for HIV; however, a higher proportion of HIV than AIDS reports has incomplete HIV exposure information. Persons reported with HIV (not AIDS) are younger, more likely to be women and black or Hispanic minorities, and more recently infected than persons reported with AIDS (Tables 22 through 26). HIV surveillance data should be interpreted with knowledge of local practices because they are influenced by the availability of HIV test facilities and the proportion of HIV-infected persons who seek or defer HIV testing. Among men reported with AIDS in 1995, male-to-male sexual contact again accounted for the largest proportion of cases (51 percent), followed by injecting drug use (24 percent, Table 4). These proportions will increase slightly as exposure information is completed for persons initially reported without a risk for HIV infection (13 percent). Among young men (ages 20 to 24 years), male-to-male sexual contact and/or injecting drug use accounted for 76 percent of AIDS cases and 63 percent of HIV infection cases reported in 1995 (Tables 7 and 25, respectively). Women accounted for 19 percent of adult/adolescent AIDS cases in 1995, the highest proportion yet reported among women. Most women acquired HIV infection through injecting drug use (38 percent) or sexual contact with a man with or at risk for HIV infection (38 percent, Table 5). The injecting drug use-associated epidemic among men is reflected in the heterosexual epidemic among women. Women may not recognize or report the risk behaviors of their partners, and health care providers may only record the HIV/AIDS status of a woman 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s male partners and not her partners 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 risk behaviors. Therefore, an increasing proportion of women are likely to be classified in the exposure category 22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 sex with HIV-infected person, risk not specified. 22 ̆ 0 ac?The epidemic in women is reflected in the epidemic in children, nearly all of whom acquired HIV infection perinatally. In 1995, 84 percent of children reported with AIDS were black or Hispanic, and AIDS rates per 100, 000 population among black and Hispanic children were 16 and 6 times higher (6. 4 and 2. 3, respectively) than among white children (0. 4, Table 10). The number of children reported with AIDS in 1995 (800) was lower than that reported in 1994 (1, 034). Changes in surveillance practices, the number of infected women giving birth, and the clinical management of women and children may each have contributed to this decline. Studies are underway to determine the relative contributions of each of these factors. In 1995, the 28 states that reported HIV infection (not AIDS) among children reported 229 pediatric AIDS cases and 342 pediatric HIV cases (Table 24). In these states, reports of children perinatally exposed to HIV (with subsequent follow-up to determine infection status) will be useful in evaluating the impact of Public Health Service guidelines on preventing perinatal transmission (see Suggested Reading). The 1993 expansion of the AIDS surveillance case definition has caused fluctuations in the numbers of reported AIDS cases during the past 3 years. However, reporting trends are gradually stabilizing. Each year since 1993, a larger proportion of persons with AIDS was reported based on immunologic criteria added to the case definition. State-to-state fluctuations in reporting patterns may reflect a number of factors, including use of laboratory-initiated reporting of severe immunosuppres- sion, enhanced surveillance efforts in some states, and increases in AIDS incidence in some geographic areas. In many of the states (Table 1) and metropolitan areas (Table 2) that reported more cases in 1995 than in 1994, HIV was introduced later than in the bicoastal epicenters, where the epidemic emerged early in the 1980 s. However, reported AIDS incidence rates per 100, 000 population remained highest in Puerto Rico, New York, Florida, New Jersey, Maryland, and Connecticut, and in heavily affected metropolitan areas, many of which are in these same states (e. g., Jersey City, San Francisco, West Palm Beach, San Juan, Baltimore, New Haven, Orlando, and Hartford). To promote the uses of national HIV/AIDS surveillance data for tracking the epidemic, for program planning and evaluation, and for facilitating comparisons to state and local surveillance data, the HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report is now available through the Internet.
