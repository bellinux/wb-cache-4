30|$|Plain, twill and satin <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> <b>of</b> cotton, {{polyester}} and polyester-cotton of 150  g/m 2 and 200  g/m 2 {{have been}} used to study their suitability for surgical gowns before and after application of flouropolymer and antibacterial finishes. Different concentration levels of fluoropolymer and antibacterial finishes were used to find the level of finishes required for different AAMI protection levels along with their durability using standard laundering cycles. It is observed that all the fabrics except 150  g/m 2 cotton fabric, can be used for AAMI protection level 1 only without any finish. The water repellence <b>of</b> <b>fabrics</b> increases on application of fluoropolymer finish. 4 % fluoropolymer finish on these fabrics {{can be used to make}} them suitable for AAMI protection level 2. Increasing fluropolymer concentration level further increases the hydrostatic pressure but does not make them suitable for protection level 3 and therefore are not recommended for critical areas of the surgical gown. Twill <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> <b>of</b> 200  g/m 2 show highest hydrostatic pressure, but higher stiffness and low air permeability make them quite uncomfortable for longer duration usage. Satin fabrics are more comfortable offering higher air permeability and lower stiffness, but show lowest hydrostatic pressure values and therefore offer minimal water repellence. Repeated laundering cycles lead to reduction in the barrier resistance <b>of</b> <b>fabrics.</b> It is observed that 150  g/m 2 polyester and twill woven 200  g/m 2 cotton fabrics with 4 % fluoropolymer finish maintain their AAMI protection level 2 upto 20 washing cycles. Satin <b>woven</b> <b>fabrics</b> treated with 4 % fluoropolymer finish can maintain AAMI protection level 2 upto 5 washing cycles only. 1.5 % antibacterial finish is sufficient to inhibit the growth of S. aureus bacteria for all fabric samples and this antibacterial activity is maintained upto 20 washing cycles for all fabrics.|$|R
