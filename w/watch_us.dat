5|$|Despite {{their best}} efforts to control Viet Cong {{activities}} across the river in the Thu Thiem area, the South Vietnamese military and police could not stop Viet Cong agents from operating there. So Viet Cong members of the 65th Special Operations Group were able to <b>watch</b> <b>U.S.</b> and South Vietnamese military activities at the port, while they were preparing to attack American targets. Lam Son Nao, a commando of the 65th Special Operations Group, was also an employee at the port facility. As his unit was assigned with the mission to attack the American escort carrier, Nao took advantage of his position as an employee at the port facility, to reconnoitre Card to design the best strategy to sabotage the ship and all the military hardware on board. Nao’s father had previously worked at the port facility as a tradesman, so he memorised all the underground tunnels and sewerage systems which ran {{in and out of}} the facility. He advised Nao that the best way to enter the area where the American ships normally anchored, was via the sewer tunnel opposite Thu Thiem.|$|E

500|$|The Beatles {{steadily}} improved {{during their}} time in Hamburg, and this was noticed by other musicians who were there at the time. McCartney recalled, [...] "We got better and better and other groups started coming to <b>watch</b> <b>us.</b> The accolade of accolades was when Sheridan would {{come in from the}} Top Ten (the big club where we aspired to go) or when Rory Storm or Ringo [...] would hang around to <b>watch</b> <b>us.</b> ‘What'd I Say’ was always the one that really got them." [...] The song was often played by the group, once being played for 90 minutes non-stop, with group members walking off stage to wash and drink before returning. Sutcliffe wrote a letter to his mother saying, [...] "We have improved a thousand-fold since our arrival and Allan Williams, who is here at the moment, tells us that there is no group in Liverpool to touch us." ...|$|E

500|$|In 2013, Paul {{established}} the [...] "Ron Paul Channel", an Internet broadcast. Its slogan is [...] "Turn Off Your TV. Turn On the Truth." [...] Speaking about the channel, Paul said, [...] "I {{was at a}} debate one time a couple years ago, where I didn't think I got a fair shake. In a two-hour debate, I had 89 seconds. I thought, maybe there's {{something wrong with the}} media. Maybe they're not covering us fairly. I'm just using it as a pun, but there’s a bit of truth to this. We don't get a fair shake. The people who believe in liberty and limited government don't expect it from the ordinary media." [...] Speaking about his youth appeal, he noted, [...] "They don’t sit and watch TV and turn the programs on at seven o'clock to <b>watch</b> <b>us</b> like that – so I thought the technology was there. The country is ripe for the continuation of this revolution." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Immortality" [...] was {{watched by}} about 3.7 million viewers, drawing a 1.4/4 ratings share on its initial broadcast, down 12.5 {{percent from the}} {{previous}} episode's viewership. During the first half hour, the episode placed second in its timeslot, but dropped to fourth for its second half. Its lead-in, Kitchen Nightmares, also dropped 12 percent, as did all other network shows for that night. Time shifting viewing added 57 percent to the episode's ratings for three days out, and 64 percent for a week following the first airing. This was the greatest DVR gain yet for the series in that timeslot. Despite this, Joshua Jackson urged fans to watch the series live {{in an interview with}} Entertainment Weekly a week after [...] "Immortality" [...] aired. He explained [...] "I'm a positive person in general, but we really need our Fringe fans to tune in and <b>watch</b> <b>us</b> on Fridays. We did good when we first moved, but last week we did not have a good week, ratings wise. It is going to take the people that like the show to watch the show and start the campaign and show their support if they want to see us stick around for another season." ...|$|E

"The {{power and}} {{prestige}} of America {{is in the}} hands of people who will not resist the temptation to invent new missions, lay down new embargoes, throw new bombs, and fabricate new courts.

This is the opportunity they sense, and we must ask what ambitions they will declare next. ... Instead of rediscovering the virtues of traditionally defined, enlightened self-interest in the aftermath of its hands down cold war victory, America's foreign policy elites are more intoxicated than ever by their own concoction of benevolent global hegemony and indispensable power.|$|E
2500|$|Many NFL players {{commented on}} the ending, {{including}} several Packers players. Green Bay offensive lineman T. J. Lang tweeted after the game, [...] "Got fucked by the refs..

Lang openly admitted that his team was considering going on strike if the lockout was not resolved. Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers responded by saying, [...] "First of all, I've got to do something that the NFL is not going to do: I have to apologize to the fans. Our sport is a multi-billion dollar machine, generated by people who pay good money to come <b>watch</b> <b>us</b> play. The product on the field is not being complemented by an appropriate set of officials. The games are getting out of control."
