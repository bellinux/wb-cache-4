5|$|Although {{these issues}} with {{censorship}} obscured and truncated the film {{for many years}} following its release, the film was soon recognized by many western critics and film directors as a highly original and accomplished <b>work.</b> <b>Even</b> more since being restored to its original version, Andrei Rublev {{has come to be}} {{regarded as one of the}} greatest films of all time, and has often been ranked highly in both the Sight & Sound critics' and directors' polls.|$|E
5|$|By 17 November the Mafeking and Pretoria districts {{had been}} fully explored, {{with more than}} 200 bodies raised to the surface in the {{preceding}} two days. On 20 November an official announcement reported that 439 miners had died, of whom 33 were still unaccounted for. Toward {{the end of the}} month, the men voted to return to <b>work,</b> <b>even</b> though the western workings were still out of action and 11 bodies were still missing.|$|E
5|$|Despite injury troubles, Totti {{recovered}} {{in time to}} join the national team for their victorious 2006 World Cup campaign, {{despite a lack of}} match practice during his three months on the sidelines. Italy manager Marcello Lippi showed enormous faith in Totti, assuring him during his rehabilitation that his spot in Italy's World Cup squad was secure and to focus on recuperating. This encouragement and show of faith fueled Totti's desire to <b>work</b> <b>even</b> harder to overcome {{what could have been a}} career-ending injury and make it to the World Cup against all odds (and much of the Italian media's opinion).|$|E

5|$|On July 25 The New York Times {{reported}} that a general strike {{had taken place in}} Scranton. A committee representing the miners called a meeting with W. R. Storrs, coal superintendent. They demanded higher wages, and vowed not to return to <b>work,</b> <b>even</b> if the railroad workers abandoned their strike. The brakemen, firemen and others joined, and every industry in the city was halted {{with the exception of the}} Pennsylvania Coal Company.|$|E
5|$|The Four Quartets {{was first}} {{published}} as a series in New York in 1943 and London in 1944. The original title {{was supposed to be}} the Kensington Quartets after his time in Kensington. The poems were kept as a separate entity in the United States until they were collected in 1952 as Eliot's Complete Poems and Plays, and in the United Kingdom until 1963 as part of Eliot's Complete Poems 1909–62. The delay in collecting the Four Quartets with the rest of Eliot's poetry separated them from his other <b>work,</b> <b>even</b> though they were the result of a development from his earlier poems.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the first attack took place, {{the walls of the}} fort still had not been finished, {{although}} they had been raised slightly. As a result of the hasty construction <b>work,</b> <b>even</b> at the wall's lowest part, it was high enough that the attacking force would need ladders to reach the top of the rampart. Every point where the fort was approachable, or thought weak by its defenders, was bolstered by stockades made out of stones and stakes that had been stuck into the ground. These were covered by cannons that were placed where they could be most effective, and a wicket gate that flanked {{a large part of the}} wall, was left open but cross-barred, to make it difficult for attacking soldiers to enter but also to channel their advance towards a cannon that had been placed at the gate to enfilade its approach with showers of grapeshot.|$|E

5|$|Although {{dismissive of}} Young's <b>work</b> <b>even</b> {{before he had}} read it, Champollion {{obtained}} {{a copy of the}} Encyclopedia article. Even though he was suffering from a failing health, and the chicanery of the Ultras kept him struggling to maintain his job, it motivated him to return in earnest {{to the study of the}} hieroglyphs. When he was eventually removed from his professorship by the Royalist faction, he finally had the time to work on it exclusively. While he awaited trial for treason, he produced a short manuscript, De l'écriture hiératique des anciens Égyptiens, in which he argued that the hieratic script was simply a modified form of hieroglyphic writing. Young had already anonymously published an argument to the same effect several years earlier in an obscure journal, but Champollion, having been cut off from academia, had probably not read it. In addition Champollion made the fatal error of claiming that the hieratic script was entirely ideographic. Champollion himself was never proud of this work and reportedly actively tried to suppress it by buying the copies and destroying them.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{questions}} on the later years of Cairano's career {{is that of the}} completion of the Martinengo mausoleum, the largest funereal monument of the Brescian renaissance. The commission to the jeweller and sculptor Bernardino delle Croci by the brothers Francesco and Antonio Il Martinengo of Padernello dated to 1503, with a term of three years for completion. The tomb was to house the remains of Bernardino Martinengo, the father of the two, who had left a bequest towards the work on his death in 1501 or 1502. However, it was still unfinished in 1516, when delle Croci was commissioned per a new contract to finish it by January 1518. The causes for the delay appear to have been, firstly, a commercial dispute between the jeweller and the clients, and secondly the war of 1512, which surely slowed the <b>work,</b> <b>even</b> if not entirely stopping it. It was not until 1516, following the reconquest of Brescia by the Venetian republic, that a new definitive agreement was made. The documents are incomplete but in fact the monument was completed and installed within the Corpus Christi church, probably within the terms of the contract.|$|E
5|$|The news of FreeSpace 2 {{being in}} {{development}} was confirmed in a chat on November 6, 1998. FreeSpace 2 {{was developed in}} less than one year. The Volition team revealed they had written up a story and will be targeting high-end hardware with dogfights for {{a greater number of}} ships and even larger and more deadly capital ships. The team set themselves the goals of setting new standards for both single-player and multiplayer space combat simulations, and started to modify the FreeSpace game engine for FreeSpace 2. This team was the same team which had worked on Descent: FreeSpace, plus several new members. In order to flesh out the story, Volition hired Jason Scott as a full-time writer before <b>work</b> <b>even</b> started. The linear mission structure was adopted as it was decided it would help the immersion factor of the story greatly. As the relations between the Terrans and Vasudans dominated the first game, it was decided to scale the focus down to a personal level with Admiral Bosch and his decisions to rebel. Scott's close work with the designers, and co-ordination of the voice recording process helped to tightly integrate the story into the missions, giving a more sophisticated feel to the story.|$|E

25|$|While {{this was}} taking place, in 1909 Stieglitz was {{notified}} about yet {{another sign of}} the increasingly difficult times. London’s Linked Ring, which {{for more than a}} decade Stieglitz had looked to as model for the Photo-Secession, finally dissolved in antipathy. Stieglitz knew this signaled the end of an era, but rather than be set back by these changes he began making plans to integrate Camera <b>Work</b> <b>even</b> further into the realm of modern art.|$|E

25|$|David Silverman sees {{value in}} the <b>work</b> <b>even</b> while {{considering}} it fictional. In Reading Castaneda he describes the apparent deception as a critique of anthropology field work in general – a field that relies heavily on personal experience, and necessarily views other cultures through a lens. According to Silverman, not only the descriptions of peyote trips but also the fictional {{nature of the work}} are meant to place doubt on other works of anthropology.|$|E
