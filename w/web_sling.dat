Its 70% double-surface, 36 ft span wing is cable-braced from an inverted [...] "V" [...] kingpost on early models and is strut-braced on later versions. The pilot is accommodated in a <b>web</b> <b>sling</b> seat that allows foot-launching, an unwritten requirement for ultralights in the USA prior to FAR 103. The controls are three-axis, but on the Sport model the control stick activates all surfaces, including the ruddervators. The later 103 model introduced rudder pedals. The landing gear lacks suspension, but does feature nosewheel steering.|$|E
5000|$|The AN/PRC-6 circuit uses 13 {{vacuum tubes}} for the {{receiver}} and transmitter combined, all but one subminiature. The unit may be changed to a different frequency in the field by replacing the crystal and adjusting tuned circuits, using tuning indicator ID-292/PRC-6. The tuning chart inside the case is not accurate enough to properly align the unit. The AN/PRC-6 uses a 24 inch cm whip antenna, with a BNC connector for an external direction finding antenna. There is an optional handset H-33*/PT that can {{be connected to the}} AN/PRC-6 by a [...] cable. The RT-196 can be carried over the shoulder using a provided <b>web</b> <b>sling.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Most commonly, [...]22 Long Rifle {{cartridges}} are used, especially initially, {{since the}} ammunition is inexpensive and recoil is negligible - factors that bear {{consideration in the}} face of two or more days of very intense shooting practice, firing 500+ rounds. A magazine-fed, semi-automatic rifle with quality iron peep sights and a military loop sling is what is most commonly used; example rifles are the Ruger 10/22 and the Marlin 795.The unofficial preferred rifle is a so-called [...] "Liberty Training Rifle" [...] (LTR), consisting of a Ruger 10/22 with military-style aftermarket sights made by Tech-Sights, and an inexpensive military-style <b>web</b> <b>sling.</b> Tube-fed magazine rifles, such as the Marlin Model 60, can be used, but are not as amenable to learning all the skills that are taught since they do not have removable magazines, and the action of changing out a magazine has to be simulated. Some participants prefer to use a telescopic sight if their eyes are not able to work well with iron sights. [...] Appleseed shooting clinics require approximately 500+ rounds of ammunition for the two-day course.<<ref name=BHM/> [...] The skill sets that are taught include shooting from standing, sitting/kneeling, and prone (flat on the ground) positions, as well as shooting after transitioning from standing to sitting/kneeling, and after transitioning from standing to prone, all of which are shot with time limits. Rifles are generally never loaded when transitioning from standing to either sitting or prone positions, in keeping with the 4 Rules, except when doing a 4 Minute AQT containing transitions from standing to sitting and from sitting to prone, during which times the rifle's safety is engaged. Extensive use of the loop sling is made for accuracy, and multiple sling techniques/positions are taught (e.g., hasty-loop two-point sling, hasty-hasty two point sling, single point loop sling, high-loop sling, etc.). These sling positions are variously suitable for shooting accurately either quickly or slowly, over low/medium/high ground cover, among standing/sitting/kneeling/prone positions, as situations merit. Different techniques for shooting off-hand are also taught, dependent on the style of stock on one's rifle (e.g., using a high [...] "chicken-wing" [...] technique with a straight rifle stock vs. using a low [...] "chicken-wing" [...] technique with a pistol-grip rifle stock).|$|E

50|$|Spider-Man is an action-adventure game set {{in an open}} world modern-day New York City {{and played}} from a third-person perspective. Players {{will be able to}} use Spider-Man's {{abilities}} such as <b>web</b> <b>slinging</b> and wall-crawling as well as new gameplay elements, one of which will be the ability to traverse using parkour. Environmental combat, QTEs and stealth will also be featured in the game.|$|R
50|$|Later, Peter {{tries to}} clear his head with <b>web</b> <b>slinging.</b> Not expecting to be attacked, Morlun takes Peter off-guard and a fight ensues that sends Spider-Man flying through J. Jonah Jameson's office. Spider-Man then moves the fight away from civilians and to Empire State University, where he was bitten by the spider that gave him his powers. The fight intensifies as {{momentum}} swings from Morlun's side to Spider-Man's side. After an exhausting array of punches and kicks, Spider-Man starts {{to think that he}} has the victory after a titanic and epic duel that raged across the city. However, an unscathed Morlun plucks Spider-Man's left eye out and devours it. Morlun then savagely beats Spider-Man into a bloody, unconscious mess.|$|R
5|$|The next day, Peter {{practices}} his <b>web</b> <b>slinging</b> in his bedroom, when Aunt May walks in. He {{stops and}} she suggests he takes their neighbor Mary Jane Watson to the upcoming Fall Formal. Peter cringes {{at the idea}} and heads off to school. There, it is announced football practices will be held that day and Harry wants to try out. Peter passes on joining him as he feels it will reveal his abilities. When he hears Flash Thompson planning on specifically going after Harry during tryouts, he decides to keep him safe and try out anyway. They each do good at tryout - Harry impresses the coach and the other player, while Peter does the same using his extra abilities.|$|R
50|$|Spider-Man's bodily {{tissue is}} a great deal more durable and {{resistant}} to some types of injury than a normal human (for example, a regular human punched Spider-Man and broke his wrist). However, Spider-Man is far from invulnerable. While his body is tougher than an ordinary human, as seen several times in Spider-Man 2 (via falling from average <b>web</b> <b>slinging</b> height without sustaining significant injury), he can still be injured in ways comparable to an ordinary human. For example, Spider-Man can be injured by bullets or knives composed of conventional material and from impacts of sufficient force. However, if injured, his accelerated metabolism is capable of repairing itself many times faster than an ordinary human. A doctor has told Spider-Man that it would be impossible for a normal man to survive the punishment that he has endured.|$|R
5000|$|Mary Jane Watson {{appears in}} Spider-Man: Web of Shadows, voiced by Dana Seltzer. Unlike {{most of her}} {{appearances}} in Spider-Man games, she takes an active participation {{in one of the}} boss battles, taking out foes with a shotgun while Spider-Man fights a symbiote-possessed Black Cat. In the beginning of the game, she is caught in the crossfire during a fight between Venom and Spider-Man and is put into the hospital. She frequently appeared throughout the game, where her cutscenes are based on the player's choice. In one Red Suit ending, she joins Spider-Man in <b>web</b> <b>slinging</b> across New York. In another Red Suit ending, Spider-Man attempted to call her to apologize for his own actions but she did not pick up and left a message on her phone hoping that she'll one day forgive for what had to be done. In one Black Suit ending, Mary Jane abandons Peter completely for the willingness to use the Black Suit even after promising her otherwise, particularly when using its powers to save Black Cat. In another Black Suit ending, Spider-Man vows to reclaim Mary Jane.|$|R
50|$|Junie (Vhong Navarro), is an {{ice cream}} vendor, who goes around selling ice cream to children, and adults alike. After his shift, Junie gets in a predicament with a rival vendor Dodoy (Jay Manalo). Their manager, angered by their actions, demotes Junie to a {{warehouse}} guard. Dodoy celebrates, only to be demoted too, working a different shift than that of Junie. Junie goes home in a bad mood, until he sees {{the love of his}} life, Liana (Aubrey Miles). After dinner, Junie gets ready to sleep, to work a new job the next day. While on the job, Junie accidentally swallows a spider, thus giving him <b>web</b> <b>slinging</b> abilities, and becoming Gagamboy. After his shift, Dodoy comes in to his work, and leaves a sandwich unprotected. A roach slips into his sandwich, and as he eats it, he collapses, only to regain consciousness as a large roach. He hires two henchmen, and calls himself, Ipisman (Cockroachman). Junie and Dodoy, both try to win Liana's love. Dodoy practically gives up, only to return as Ipisman, to kidnap Liana to lure Gagamboy to his lair. There, he plans to finish off Gagamboy, but the tables turned and Dodoy was destroyed.|$|R
40|$|Rig Check was {{developed}} by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) in partnership with safety experts from the oil and gas extraction industry. It is made up of 35 inspection forms. The forms are designed to be used by rig workers to document the inspection of tools and equipment commonly found on rotary and workover rigs. Each inspection form includes instructions for assessing and recording the condition of the equipment. When applicable, relevant federal regulations and industry recommended practices are included. The Rig Check inspection forms are an excellent training tool for short service employees, who may not be familiar with the tools and equipment found on oil and gas rigs. Small companies whose safety and health resources are limited may find Rig Check useful for enhancing their HSE programs. The forms can also be downloaded from the NIOSH website at: www. cdc. gov/niosh/programs/oilgas/products. html. Rig Check Monthly Inspection Forms: [...] Emergency Response: [...] 1.

50|$|Traditional High Power Rifle {{shooting}} is most commonly done using a rifle {{with a military}} <b>web</b> or leather <b>sling</b> attached, with the shooter using a shooting mat, wearing a shooting jacket, and using a specialized glove that is worn on the support hand. The {{shooting is}} done at fixed, specific distances from the target line. Both loop slings, affixed at only {{the front end of}} the rifle stock, as well as hasty-slings, affixed at both the front and rear of the rifle stock, are also often used. Those matches involving F-Class shooting add additional options, permitting use of a bipod, as well as joystick-equipped rests similar to those used in bench rest shooting.|$|R
