5|$|Complications are {{distinct}} medical problems that may arise {{as a result}} of the TBI. The results of traumatic brain injury vary widely in type and duration; they include physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral complications. TBI can cause prolonged or permanent effects on consciousness, such as coma, brain death, persistent vegetative state (in <b>which</b> <b>patients</b> are unable to achieve a state of alertness to interact with their surroundings), and minimally conscious state (in <b>which</b> <b>patients</b> show minimal signs of being aware of self or environment). Lying still for long periods can cause complications including pressure sores, pneumonia or other infections, progressive multiple organ failure, and deep venous thrombosis, which can cause pulmonary embolism. Infections that can follow skull fractures and penetrating injuries include meningitis and abscesses. Complications involving the blood vessels include vasospasm, in which vessels constrict and restrict blood flow, the formation of aneurysms, in which the side of a vessel weakens and balloons out, and stroke.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, {{working with}} Dr. Theodore Wadsworth, Todd gained {{permission}} {{to start a}} hospital near the present-day Farmington/Plainville border for smallpox inoculation. The facility, commonly called Hospital Rock, is found deep in the second-growth hardwood forest of Rattlesnake Mountain in Connecticut and was used from 1792-1794. Though the building is no longer present, the nearby rock ledge upon <b>which</b> <b>patients</b> would socialize remains. It was this rock that lent the facility its name. At this location, they could also receive mail and various packages.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the tight}} control of enzyme {{activity}} {{is essential for}} homeostasis, any malfunction (mutation, overproduction, underproduction or deletion) of a single critical enzyme {{can lead to a}} genetic disease. The malfunction of just one type of enzyme out of the thousands of types present in the human body can be fatal. An example of a fatal genetic disease due to enzyme insufficiency is Tay-Sachs disease, in <b>which</b> <b>patients</b> lack the enzyme hexosaminidase.|$|E

5|$|Sleep {{problems}} are {{a feature of}} the disease and can be worsened by medications. Symptoms can manifest as daytime drowsiness (including sudden sleep attacks resembling narcolepsy), disturbances in REM sleep, or insomnia.

5|$|The Palladian-fronted {{building}} was originally seven separate blocks into <b>which</b> <b>patients</b> were allocated {{depending on their}} class.

Brislington House later influenced the design and construction of other asylums and influenced Acts of Parliament.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis and {{treatment}} cost patients money, and the player can change hospital policy, including {{the amount of}} diagnosis patients require. This can be set to over 100 per cent to force patients to have further unnecessary diagnoses. Other policies include when staff can go on breaks and whether they can leave rooms, and loans can be taken out. From time to time, events such as emergencies (in <b>which</b> <b>patients</b> arrive and must be cured within a time limit or they will die), and epidemics (in which a disease spreads rapidly) occur. During the latter, the player can attempt {{to cover it up}} by curing all affected patients before a health inspector turns up. If the player fails, he or she is fined and must face a damaged reputation, a statistic that shows how well the hospital is doing and affects the flow of patients. VIPs may also occasionally ask to tour the hospital; if impressed, the player is granted a cash bonus, a reputation increase, or both. There is an advisor who keeps the player informed about what is going on. Rats may infest the hospital, and the player is able to shoot them with the cursor.|$|E

40|$|In {{children}} with gastroesophageal reflux (GER) disease refractory to pharmacological therapies, anti-reflux surgery (fundoplication) {{may be a}} treatment of last resort. The applicability of fundoplication has been hampered by the inability to predict <b>which</b> <b>patient</b> may benefit from surgery and <b>which</b> <b>patient</b> is likely to develop post-operative dysphagia. pH impedance measurement and conventional manometry are unable to predict dysphagia, while the role of gastric emptying remains poorly understood.

40|$|Total joint {{replacement}} is an end-stage proce-dure for incapacitating arthritis. Salvage proce-dures {{are limited}} to revision joint replacement, resection or arthrodesis.

5|$|The exosome {{complex is}} the target of autoantibodies in {{patients}} suffering from various autoimmune diseases. These autoantibodies are mainly found in people that suffer from the PM/Scl overlap syndrome, an autoimmune disease in <b>which</b> <b>patients</b> have symptoms from both scleroderma and either polymyositis or dermatomyositis. Autoantibodies can be detected in the serum of patients {{by a variety of}} assays. In the past, the most commonly used methods were double immunodiffusion using calf thymus extracts, immunofluorescence on HEp-2 cells or immunoprecipitation from human cell extracts. In immunoprecipitation assays with sera from anti-exosome positive sera, a distinctive set of proteins is precipitated. Already years before the exosome complex was identified, this pattern was termed the PM/Scl complex. Immunofluorescence using sera from these patients usually shows a typical staining of the nucleolus of cells, which sparked the suggestion that the antigen recognized by autoantibodies might be important in ribosome synthesis. More recently, recombinant exosome proteins have become available and these have been used to develop line immunoassays (LIAs) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for detecting these antibodies.|$|E
25|$|Classically, the {{bringing}} of unconscious {{thoughts and}} feelings to consciousness is brought about by encouraging a patient to talk about dreams and engage in free association, in <b>which</b> <b>patients</b> report their thoughts without reservation and make no attempt to concentrate while doing so. Another important element of psychoanalysis is transference, the process by <b>which</b> <b>patients</b> displace onto their analysts feelings and ideas which derive from previous figures in their lives. Transference was first seen as a regrettable phenomenon that interfered with the recovery of repressed memories and disturbed patients' objectivity, but by 1912, Freud {{had come to see}} it as {{an essential part of the}} therapeutic process.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Clinical {{trials are}} {{important}} for patients, for researchers and for companies. One of the major bottlenecks is patient recruitment. This task requires to match a great quantity {{of information about the}} patient with numerous eligibility criteria, in a logically-complex combination. Moreover, the patient’s information required by some of the eligibility criteria may not be available at the time of pre-screening. In such situations, the classic approach based on negation as failure ignores the distinction between a trial for <b>which</b> <b>patient</b> eligibility should be rejected and trials for <b>which</b> <b>patient</b> eligibility cannot be asserted, which resuls in underestimating recruitment. We propose an OWL design pattern for modeling eligibility criteria based on the open world assumption to address the missing information problem...|$|R
40|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} {{are one of}} {{the most}} prevalent neurological disorders, affecting approximately 1 % of the population in developed countries [1, 2]. Until recently, drug treatment of epilepsy has been empirical but in recent years due to improved un-derstanding of seizure neurochemistry and of the mechanisms of action of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), drug therapy has become more rational. Nevertheless, it is currently impossible to predict <b>which</b> <b>patient</b> will respond to a particular AED, and <b>which</b> <b>patient</b> will experience adverse drug effects. The only practical way to determine whether a drug will work in a specific patient, is to try it [2].
