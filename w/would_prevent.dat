5|$|The Voluntary Human Extinction Movement (VHEMT) is an {{environmental}} movement {{that calls for}} all people to abstain from reproduction to cause the gradual voluntary extinction of humankind. VHEMT supports human extinction primarily because, in the group's view, it <b>would</b> <b>prevent</b> environmental degradation. The group states that {{a decrease in the}} human population <b>would</b> <b>prevent</b> a significant amount of human-caused suffering. The extinctions of non-human species and the scarcity of resources required by humans are frequently cited by the group as evidence of the harm caused by human overpopulation.|$|E

5|$|In February 1777 while encamped at Morristown, New Jersey, Washington became {{convinced}} that only smallpox inoculation by variolation <b>would</b> <b>prevent</b> the destruction of his Army. He ordered the inoculation of all troops and, by some reports, death by smallpox in the ranks dropped from 17% of all deaths to 1% of all deaths.|$|E
5|$|While moving {{within the}} cabin, Aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for lift {{off from the}} Moon. There was concern this <b>would</b> <b>prevent</b> firing the engine, {{stranding}} them on the Moon. Fortunately, a felt-tip pen was sufficient to activate the switch. Had this not worked, the Lunar Module circuitry could have been reconfigured to allow firing the ascent engine.|$|E

5|$|Although heavily outnumbered, the Greek Allies were {{persuaded by}} the Athenian general Themistocles {{to bring the}} Persian fleet to battle again, {{in the hope that}} a victory <b>would</b> <b>prevent</b> naval {{operations}} against the Peloponnese. The Persian king Xerxes was also eager for a decisive battle. As a result of subterfuge on the part of Themistocles, the Persian navy rowed into the Straits of Salamis and tried to block both entrances. In the cramped conditions of the Straits, the great Persian numbers were an active hindrance, as ships struggled to maneuver and became disorganized. Seizing the opportunity, the Greek fleet formed in line and scored a decisive victory.|$|E
5|$|At age 37, Mary {{turned her}} {{attention}} to finding a husband and producing an heir, which <b>would</b> <b>prevent</b> the Protestant Elizabeth (still next-in-line under the terms of Henry VIII's will and the Act of Succession of 1544) from succeeding to the throne. Edward Courtenay and Reginald Pole were both mentioned as prospective suitors, but her cousin Charles V suggested she marry his only son, Prince Philip of Spain. Philip had a son from a previous marriage and was heir apparent to vast territories in Continental Europe and the New World. As part of the marriage negotiations, a portrait of Philip, by Titian, was sent to her in September 1553.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} May, David Ben-Gurion was {{convinced}} that the Arab Legion expected to take control of all Jerusalem. Moreover, after the fighting, the situation there deteriorated: the Jewish community had very small reserves of fuel, bread, sugar and tea, which would last for only 10 days, and water for 3 months. In Glubb's opinion, the aim was still to prevent the Israelis from reinforcing the city and taking control of its Arab part. On 29 May, the UN Security Council announced its intention to impose a ceasefire for 4 weeks, which <b>would</b> <b>prevent</b> further capture of territory and thus prevent resupplying the besieged city.|$|E

5|$|Brian Delate as Walter Moore playing Kirk Burbank, Truman's father. When Truman was a boy, his {{character}} {{on the show}} was killed off to instill a fear of water in his son that <b>would</b> <b>prevent</b> Truman from leaving the set; however, he sneaks back onto the set when Truman is an adult. This causes Truman to begin questioning his staged life, and {{as he tries to}} get away from it the writers are forced to write a plot in which Kirk had not drowned but had suffered from amnesia.|$|E
5|$|County {{officials}} did not {{take care of the}} problem, so West sent Hobbs, hoping the presence of a woman <b>would</b> <b>prevent</b> any outbreak of violence. She was dispatched with orders to restore order and to implement martial law if necessary. While Hobbs was traveling to Eastern Oregon, both she and Governor West were coy with reporters about the presence of the militia, suggesting that Hobbs might be acting alone.|$|E
5|$|During the Obama presidency, some {{progressive}} {{lawyers and}} activists called for Ginsburg to retire so Obama {{would be able}} to appoint a like-minded successor, particularly while the Democratic Party held control of the U.S. Senate. They pointed to Ginsburg's age and past health issues as factors making her longevity uncertain. Ginsburg rejected these pleas. She affirmed her wish to remain a justice as long as she was mentally sharp enough to perform her duties. Moreover, Ginsburg opined that the political climate <b>would</b> <b>prevent</b> Obama from appointing a jurist like herself.|$|E

25|$|The {{purpose of}} the writ of coram nobis is to bring before the court {{rendering}} judgment matters of fact which, if known {{at the time the}} judgment was rendered, <b>would</b> have <b>prevented</b> its rendition. It enables the court to recall some adjudication that was made while some fact existed which <b>would</b> have <b>prevented</b> rendition of the judgment but which, through no fault of the party, was not presented.|$|R

5|$|Faced {{with the}} {{prospect}} of a takeover by the pro-communists, UMNO changed their minds about the merger. On 27 May, Malaya's Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, mooted the idea of a Federation of Malaysia, comprising existing Federation of Malaya, Singapore, Brunei and the British Borneo territories of North Borneo and Sarawak. The UMNO leaders believed that the additional Malay population in the Borneo territories would offset Singapore's Chinese population. The British government, for its part, believed that the merger <b>would</b> <b>prevent</b> Singapore from becoming a haven for communism.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{separation}} burn, the crew {{set to work}} performing the standard late inspection of the thermal protection system of the orbiter. Using the robotic arm, McArthur, Altman, and Johnson worked through the procedures to inspect the wing leading-edge panels, reinforced carbon-carbon nose cap, and heat shield tiles. After evaluating the weather reports, managers on the ground slightly refined the schedule for landing, opting to bring the shuttle home one orbit early {{to try to avoid}} the possibility of showers that <b>would</b> <b>prevent</b> a landing on Friday. The new landing opportunity would bring the crew home at 10:01am EDT.|$|E
5|$|For an implant {{to become}} {{permanently}} stable, the body must grow bone {{to the surface}} of the implant (osseointegration). Based on this biologic process, it was thought that loading an implant during the osseointegration period would result in movement that <b>would</b> <b>prevent</b> osseointegration, and thus increase implant failure rates. As a result, three to six months of integrating time (depending on various factors) was allowed before placing the teeth on implants (restoring them).|$|E

5|$|Halotus {{was also}} {{known to have}} been a eunuch. There are many {{possible}} reasons for this but the most likely is related to the possibility of sexual contact between servant and master; a prohibition against sexual contact between royalty and servants, guards and slaves was not uncommon {{in many parts of the}} world during Halotus' era and it was thought that male castration <b>would</b> <b>prevent</b> this. Halotus may have been required to submit to castration in order to hold his position.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Arnold Palmer {{took over}} as the honorary starter. Palmer also had the honor in 2008 and 2009. At the 2010 and 2011 Masters Tournaments, Jack Nicklaus joined Palmer as an honorary co-starter for the event. In 2012, Gary Player joined them. Palmer {{announced}} in March 2016 that a lingering shoulder issue <b>would</b> <b>prevent</b> him from partaking in the 2016 tee shot. Palmer was still in attendance for the ceremony.|$|E
5|$|It rained for {{the next}} day and a half, {{preventing}} battle. During this time, Baum's men constructed a small redoubt at {{the crest of the hill}} and hoped that the weather <b>would</b> <b>prevent</b> the Americans from attacking before reinforcements arrived. Stark sent out skirmishers to probe the German lines, and managed to kill thirty Indians in spite of the difficulties of keeping their gunpowder dry. Reinforcements for both sides marched out on the 15th; travel was quite difficult due to the heavy rains. Burgoyne sent 550 men under Heinrich von Breymann, while Warner's company of about 350 Green Mountain Boys came south from Manchester under Lieutenant Samuel Safford's command.|$|E
