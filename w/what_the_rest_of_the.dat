The episode included the first appearances of guest actors Andre Royo and Amy Madigan, who would both appear in several later episodes. It first aired in the United States on Fox in September 23, 2010, receiving almost all positive reviews due to the combination of emotional storylines, suspense, action, and humor. Many {{thought it was a}} good indicator of <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season had to offer, while others appreciated the numerous popular culture references that set the two universes apart.|$|E

500|$|One idea under early {{consideration}} was {{to include}} a mini-set at each stop, containing a full performance of one of Springsteen's classic albums. [...] Van Zandt predicted that they would play most of Working on a Dream during {{the initial stages of}} the tour, but <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show would be was uncertain.

500|$|The Tenth Five-Year Plan (1976–1981) was {{referred}} to by Kosygin as the [...] "plan of quality". Brezhnev rejected Kosygin's bid for producing more consumer goods during the Tenth Five-Year Plan. Because of it the total volume of consumer goods in industrial production only stood at 26 percent. Kosygin's son-in-law notes that Kosygin was furious with the decision, and proclaimed increased defence expenditure would become the Soviet Union's [...] "complete ruin". The plan was less ambitious than its predecessors, with targets of national industrial growth no higher than <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> world had already achieved. Soviet agriculture would receive a share investment of 34 percent, a share much larger than its proportional contribution to the Soviet economy, as it accounted for only 3 percent of Soviet GDP.|$|E
500|$|Feedforward processing: The {{cerebellum}} {{differs from}} most {{other parts of}} the brain (especially the cerebral cortex) in that the signal processing is almost entirely feedforward—that is, signals move unidirectionally through the system from input to output, with very little recurrent internal transmission. The small amount of recurrence that does exist consists of mutual inhibition; there are no mutually excitatory circuits. This feedforward mode of operation means that the cerebellum, in contrast to the cerebral cortex, cannot generate self-sustaining patterns of neural activity. Signals enter the circuit, are processed by each stage in sequential order, and then leave. As Eccles, Ito, and Szentágothai wrote, [...] "This elimination in the design of all possibility of reverberatory chains of neuronal excitation is undoubtedly a great advantage in the performance of the cerebellum as a computer, because <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nervous system requires from the cerebellum is presumably not some output expressing the operation of complex reverberatory circuits in the cerebellum but rather a quick and clear response to the input of any particular set of information." ...|$|E

500|$|Scott {{chose not}} to show the full Alien {{for most of the}} film, keeping most of its body in shadow {{in order to create a}} sense of terror and heighten suspense.

[...] The Alien has been referred to as [...] "one of the most iconic movie monsters in film history", and its biomechanical appearance and sexual overtones have been frequently noted. Roger Ebert remarked that [...] "Alien uses a tricky device to keep the alien fresh throughout the movie: It evolves the nature and appearance of the creature, so we never know quite what it looks like or what it can do...The first time we get a good look at the alien, as it bursts from the chest of poor Kane (John Hurt).

500|$|Several {{songs are}} {{selected}} as stand-outs throughout the album. [...] "Tug of War" [...] is labelled as [...] "the strongest {{song on the}} album", with John D. Luerssen writing that [...] "the cohesiveness of the material suggests the lads in Kid Kilowatt exited this side project as friends. After all, only buddies capable of putting their differences aside could craft the soaring, majestic [...] "Tug of War," [...] where Brodsky's wide-reaching pipes mesh brilliantly with KK's ace musicianship". He continues to say that [...] "the disc shifts from roaring, expansive rockers like [...] "Bicycle Song" [...] to crunching anthems like [...] "Ted Nugent" [...] and on to lilting, near-ballads like [...] "Memorial Drive" [...] with inexplicable ease". Moore writes that [...] "The Scope" [...] "encapsulates <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album will sound like. It starts out sounding rather crunchy and smooths out as the album progresses, providing a good contrasting effect that runs throughout the album". Moore, however, writes that [...] "Memorial Drive" [...] is [...] "only mediocre. It's the only song on the album over five minutes long. Playing slow just isn't this band's forte, although {{they have the ability}} to write poignant lyrics". Similarly, a ScenePointBlank review states that [...] "Cadence for a Rainy Day" [...] and [...] "Memorial Drive" [...] "often diverge and lead the listener off-course".|$|E

[...] We had to plant some roots, lest we start to write songs about living on a tour bus. So we had to fall in love, we had to fall out of love, we had to make homes." [...] Guitarist Michael Einziger elaborated further, [...] "It just got to this point where we had been going strong for such {{a long period of time}} that we really accomplished all of our goals.

Eleven of the songs were previewed at the album party but not all were completely mixed, mastered or finished. The album's first single [...] "Put It Down" [...] featuring Chris Brown has a distinctly hip-hop flavour, with Norwood taking on her [...] "rap-singing" [...] vocal performance she last used when assuming her persona of Bran'Nu on Timbaland's album Shock Value II (2009). The song is built around a [...] "mid-tempo thumping production" [...] courtesy of Bangladesh. Its co-writer and co-producer Sean Garrett revealed that [...] "Put It Down" [...] was a [...] "good segway" [...] to <b>what</b> <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> album would sound like. By contrast not all of Garrett's songs follow the same flow. The album's second single, titled [...] "Wildest Dreams", was also written by Garrett, but this time produced by The Bizzness. An introspective ballad, [...] "Wildest Dreams" [...] speaks about Norwood's losing out emotionally. Lyrics include the line [...] "Never in my wildest dreams did I think someone could care 'bout me/ Not just the way you love me, but you know I'm emotional (sometimes)."
