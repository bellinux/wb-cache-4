To estimate the in-air beam intensities at points on the isocenter plane for an MLC field, we employed an MLC leaf-field output subtraction method, using an extended radiation source on each of the X-ray target and the flattening filter as well as simplified two-dimensional plates to simulate the three-dimensional jaws and MLC structures. A special correction factor was introduced for nonuniform incident beam intensities, particularly produced at MLC fields. The in-phantom dose calculation was performed by treating the phantom, the <b>wedge</b> <b>filter,</b> the wedge holder and the MLC as parts of a unified irradiated body, where we proposed to use a special factor for the density scaling theorem within the unified irradiated body. Conclusions: The phantom dose was generally separated into nine dose-components: The primary and scatter dose-components produced in the phantom; the primary and scatter dose-components emanating from the wedge, the wedge holder and the MLC; and the electron contamination dose-component. From the calculated and measured percentage depth dose (PDD) and off-center ratio (OCR) datasets, we may conclude that the convolution method can achieve accurate dose calculations even under MLC and/or wedge filtration...|$|E

Even {{a small percentage of}} the total treatment dose might cause injury in such cases. The sources of peripheral dose are leakage from the treatment unit, scatter from the secondary collimators and beam modifiers such as wedges and blocks, and internal scatter originating in the patient. AimTo determine the peripheral dose (PD) for multileaf collimator (MLC) based linear accelerator in water equivalent slab phantom for open and wedged fields. Materials/MethodsPD measurements were carried out for 6 and 15 MV photons using a 0. 4 cc parallel plate chamber in the slab phantom. Measurements were performed for different field sizes at different depths (Dmax, 5 cm and 10 cm) and up to a maximum distance of 30 cm beyond the field edges. PD was measured using <b>wedge</b> <b>filters</b> also. PD was further computed using a three-dimensional treatment planning system (3 D TPS). ResultsFor 6 MV photon beams, the maximum PD for open beams at 5 cm distance from the field edge was 3. 42 % and the minimum PD at 20 cm distance was 0. 11 %. For 15 MV, the maximum PD for open beam at 5 cm distance was 3. 07 % and the minimum PD was 0. 14 %. For <b>wedge</b> <b>filters,</b> the maximum PD measured at 5 cm distance for 6 and 15 MV photons were 5. 56 % (60 ° Wedge) and 5. 03 % (45 ° wedge). The TPS PD values showed minimal variation from the measured values.

40|$|International audiencePurpose:Proton {{scattering}} on {{beam shaping}} devices and protons slowing down on media with different densities within the treatment volume may produce dose perturbations and range variations {{that are not}} predicted by treatment planning systems. The aim of this work {{was to assess the}} dosimetric impact of elements present in ocular proton therapy treatments that may disturb the prescribed treatment plan. Both distal beam shaping devices and intraocular elements were considered. Methods:A <b>wedge</b> <b>filter,</b> tantalum fiducial marker, hemispherical compensator, two intraocular endotamponades (densities 0. 97 and 1. 92 g[*]cm− 3) and an intraocular eye lens (IOL) were considered in the study. For these elements, longitudinal dose distributions were measured and/or calculated in water in beam alignment for a clinical spread-out Bragg peak. Under the same conditions, the unperturbed dose distributions were similarly measured and/or calculated {{in the absence of the}} element. The dosimetric impact was assessed by comparison of unperturbed and perturbed dose distributions. Measurements and calculations were carried out with two methods. Measurements are based on EBT 3 films with dedicated software, which makes use of a calibration curve and correction for the quenching effect. Calculations are based on the Monte Carlo (MC) code MCNPX and reproduce the experimental conditions. Both dose maps are obtained with a resolution of 300 dpi. Results:The degree of disturbance of distal beam shaping devices is low for the <b>wedge</b> <b>filter</b> (2 % overdose ripple all along the central axis) and moderate for the hemispherical compensator (two bands of variable overdose of up to 10 % downstream the compensator lateral edges and − 5 % underdose on the plateau at off-axis distance of 5 cm). Tantalum clips produce important dose shadows (− 20 % behind the clip parallel to the beam and range reduction of 1. 1 mm) and bands of overdose (15 %). The presence of endotamponades modifies the dose distribution very significantly (− 5 % underdose on the plateau and 3 mm range prolongation for the tamponade with density 0. 97 g[*]cm− 3 and − 15 % underdose on plateau and 8 mm range reduction for that with density 1. 92 g[*]cm− 3). No dose perturbations were found for the IOL. The high performance of EBT 3 film and MC tools used was confirmed and good agreement was found between them (percentage of pixels passing the gamma test > 87 %). Conclusions:The degree of disturbance by external beam shaping devices remains low in ocular proton therapy and can be reduced by bringing accessories closer to the eye. Tantalum fiducial markers must be located in such a way that dose perturbation is not projected on the tumor. The treatment of patients with intraocular endotamponades must be carefully managed.

Material and methods : Forty patients were simulated by TIGRT treatment planning system and treated with two tangential fields of 6 MV photon beam. Wedge filters were used to homogenise dose distribution for 11 patients. Skin dose was measured by thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD- 100) and the effects of beam incident angle, thickness of irradiated region, and beam entry separation on the skin dose were analysed.

The corresponding dose values for patients who were treated with and without <b>wedge</b> <b>filter</b> were 35. 65 and 37. 20 Gy, respectively. It was determined that the beam angle affected the average skin dose while the thickness of the irradiated region and the beam entry separation did not affect dose.

40|$|Knowledge of a {{spectrograph}} slit {{function is}} necessary to interpret the unresolved lines in an observed spectrum. A theoretical slit function can be calculated from the sizes of the entrance slit, the detector aperture when it functions as an exit slit, the dispersion characteristic of the disperser, and the point spread function of the spectrograph. A measured slit function is preferred to the theoretical one for the correct interpretation of the spectral data. In a scanning spectrometer with a single exit slit, the slit function is easily measured. In a fixed grating/or disperser spectrograph, illuminating the entrance slit with a near monochromatic light from a pre-monochrmator or a tunable laser and varying the wavelength of the incident light can measure the slit function.

The methodology developed for alluvial fan extraction included preprocessing of the digital data: filtering of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for noise removal, a Fourier Transform <b>Wedge</b> <b>filter</b> for the elimination of striping in the ASTER data and geometric co-registration of the satellite and DEM data. A multiresolution segmentation technique was then developed, delivering object primitives at four resolution levels.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to improve our understanding of the contamination arising in conventional radiotherapy treatment from the various principal processes involved. The evolution of the contamination was investigated in two main ways: i) experimental measurements; and ii) the Monte Carlo method. The magnetic field strengths in this improved design were intended to result in more uniform magnetic flux densities in the area of interest, with the prediction of a greater volume where the electron contamination was effectively removed by our magnetic deflector device. The magnetic field strengths obtained by the magnetic deflector will theoretically give rise to electron deflection radii that should cause the majority of electron contamination to exit the treatment field. An enhancement of the electron dose was never experimentally observed in the irradiated area, and a percentage reduction of the skin and subcutaneous dose up to 34 % with the NdFeB magnetic device was seen for a 20 x 20 cm 2 field size. The elimination of significant electron doses due to contaminant electrons down to a depth of a few millimetres was obtained with this newly designed magnetic deflector device. In the study, the experiments were verified by an Attix chamber and radiographic film. The surface dose was increased as the field size was increased in an open field and when a Perspex tray was placed in the beam, with the increase especially significant in the case where there was both a Perspex tray and a larger field size. The Perspex tray or a <b>wedge</b> <b>filter</b> eliminate secondary electrons and generate new electrons at the same time, however, when combined with magnetic field the surface dose is reduced significantly. Results are also shown for the surface dose profile in two dimensions (x and y-axis) with the surface dose showing a decrease at all sites within the treatment field due to the magnetic deflector device, not only for an open field, but also when a wedge or a Perspex tray is in the beam. Calculation and analysis of spectra of deflected electrons in photon beams from the linear accelerator treatment head were investigated. Calculating such spectra with more accuracy requires knowledge of the characteristics of the electron beam incident on the target as well as better equipment for modelling the linear accelerator. We used the Monte Carlo method performed with BEAMnrc and DOSXYZnrc code to derive estimates for the average energy deposited in the system. Monte Carlo modelling of photon beams was achieved and adjusted for two parameters: AE = ECUT = 0. 521 MeV and AE = ECUT = 0. 700 MeV by matching the Monte Carlo calculated depth dose and beam profile data with the measured data. The capability of the Monte Carlo program in evaluating dose distribution has been verified by comparison with measurements in a water phantom and with radiographic film. The comparisons were performed for percentage of the build-up dose for various field sizes. Ionisation measurements were made in a solid water phantom by means of an Attix chamber for experiments to determine the dose in the build-up region. The measurement of skin dose uses an Attix parallel plate ionisation chamber, which is primarily used as the benchmark chamber in solid-water phantom dose build-up measurements. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to generate data to predict the dose distribution for 6 MV x-rays. Investigation of dose components of electron spectra are compared between calculated and measured dose distributions. From the Monte Carlo calculations and measurements on the surface and in the build-up region for 6 MV x-ray beams based on our results, we conclude that our optimised simulation model represents the beam emerging from the treatment head and the calculated percentage depth doses {{in such a way that}} there is a satisfactory match with the experimental measurements for the same irradiation set-ups...|$|E
40|$|The compact <b>Wedge</b> Range <b>Filter</b> (WRF) proton {{spectrometer}} {{was developed for}} OMEGA and transferred to the National Ignition Facility (NIF) as a National Ignition Campaign (NIC) diagnostic. The WRF measures the spectrum of protons from D-{sup 3 }He reactions in tuning-campaign implosions containing D and {sup 3 }He gas; in this work {{we report on the}} first proton spectroscopy measurement on the NIF using WRFs. The energy downshift of the 14. 7 -MeV proton {{is directly related to the}} total {rho}R through the plasma stopping power. Additionally, the shock proton yield is measured, which is a metric of the final merged shock strength...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{practical}} modification of a two-dimensional-imaging color filter spectrograph is presented. By the modification, the spatial displacement of images taken on different wavelengths was reduced below 10 micrometers {{in spite of}} miliradian <b>wedges</b> of the <b>filters</b> and beam pointing instability. The device allows precise two-dimensional measurement of beam dispersion and spectral beam profiles in semi-compact design...|$|R
40|$|A {{control program}} has been {{developed}} for use with an existing radiation therapy machine used to treat cancer patients with neutrons. The system is safety-critical, multitasking, meets real-time deadlines and replaces existing control system hardware and software in use since 1984. The program allows therapists to treat patients in a safe and timely manner. The system controls various <b>wedges,</b> <b>filters,</b> and a collimator that shape the therapy beam dose distribution. It checks the actual machine state against a database of prescribed machine setups, and records accumulating dose for each patient across multiple treatment sessions, and updates logs used for patient record keeping and machine quality assurance. Development involved both formal and traditional methods, including extensive use of the Z formal specification language. Since the therapy equipment is in daily clinical use with the original control system, access to real machine hardware is very limited. This limited access necessitated the use of portable components such as X windows and ANSI C to allow for most development and testing {{to be done on}} a general purpose workstation and operating system. The program was written only in ANSI C using minimal support (X Windows, the real time operating system, and ANSI C libraries) to reduce the dependence on other third party products and software. This was done to ensure stability over the lifespan of the system and for quality control of safety critical functions. Experiences with testing the program and actual clinical use is reported...|$|R
40|$|Terrestrial laser {{scanning}} is of increasing importance for surveying and hazard assessments. Digital terrain models are generated using the resultant data to analyze surface processes. In {{order to determine}} the terrain surface as precisely as possible, it is often necessary to filter out points that do not represent the terrain surface. Examples are vegetation, vehicles, and animals. Filtering in mountainous terrain is more difficult than in other topography types. Here, existing automatic filtering solutions are not acceptable, because they are usually designed for airborne scan data. The present article describes a method specifically suitable for filtering terrestrial {{laser scanning}} data. This method is based on the direct line of sight between the scanner and the measured point and the assumption that no other surface point can be located in the area above this connection line. This assumption is only true for terrestrial laser data, but not for airborne data. We present a comparison of the <b>wedge</b> <b>filtering</b> to a modified inverse distance filtering method (IDWMO) filtered point cloud data. Both methods use manually filtered surfaces as reference. The comparison shows that the mean error and root–mean-square-error (RSME) between the results and the manually filtered surface of the two methods are similar. A significantly higher number of points of the terrain surface could be preserved, however, using the wedge-filtering approach. Therefore, we suggest that wedge-filtering should be integrated as a further parameter into already existing filtering processes, but is not suited as a standalone solution so far...|$|R
