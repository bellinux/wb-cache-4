40|$|Intelligent and {{automated}} production {{have become}} an inevitable trend for manufacturing companies in developed countries. Robotic welding is a key component in order to ac- complish a competitive and effective production. Successful implementation of robotic welding is especially seen throughout the automobile industry. However, other industries {{are still on the}} verge of utilizing robotic welding. One of them is the offshore sector. Offshore structures are large constructions welded together by minor components. An ex- ample of this is ships, assembled by thick plates welded together end-to-end. To ensure sufficient strength in the welded joints, full penetration welds are needed and a multiple-pass weld sequence is required. Multiple-pass welding is generally done manually as the process is complex and difficult to automate. This thesis presents an automated solution for multiple-pass welding of thick V-groove butt joints with variable geometry. This welding configuration is common in shipbuilding and in fabrication of high pressure vessels. Previous research on automated multiple-pass planning have been reviewed and used as a basis for the solution presented in this thesis. A procedure that determines a welding sequence containing the number of layers and passes based on geometrical properties of a butt joint, is created using different programming and simulation software. Weld beads are approximated as sets of parallelograms and trapeziums. Algorithms in this procedure calculates the position and pose of the welding torch, amplitude of weaving and the number of passes for each layer based on a set of parameters and criteria. These are welding speed, filler wire feed speed, maximum amplitude of weaving and maximum allowed bead height. A robot program is then created for execution of the welding sequence. The procedure have been implemented in the robotics laboratory at the Institute of Production and Quality Engineering, NTNU. This implementation showed the effective- ness of the automated procedure by successfully welding different V-groove butt joints. A set of preliminary tests were conducted to determine viable combinations of welding parameters. Continuous testing was then carried out to adjust the deposition efficiency coefficient and the <b>weaving</b> <b>factor.</b> In the end, conformity between the procedure and the experimental results was obtained. The results from all welding experiments are presented in the thesis...|$|E

Fifteen wool fabrics, which differ only on weave were weaved for investigations. The test was carried out according to LST EN ISO 13936 - 1 standard. First of all, the well known factors such as fabric structure factor P and average float F were investigated and then a new fabric structure factor was offered, which the best characterizes the weave from thread slippage point of view.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} {{geometric description}} {{for a large}} range of two-dimensional woven architectures is proposed which {{can serve as a}} basis for stiffness and strength modelling of fabric composites. We introduce a strict logical scheme for calculating the full geometry of a general yarn architecture. First, a library of 108 rectangular macro-cells has been put together to build complex material unit cells. This complexity is caused by the yarn interlacing style and the existence of different yarn sizes in the fabric composite. Next, each macro-cell is divided in a number of micro-cells. The geometric model, based on a lenticular yarn cross-section, predicts the <b>weave</b> cover <b>factor,</b> the global and local fibre volume fractions and the yarn orientations.

The control of reinforcement structure and fibre modification through treatment are among the approaches. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the impact behaviour of woven coir-epoxy composite as a function of fabric density and fabric modification using alkalisation treatment. Samples were subjected to low-velocity impact penetration tests and image analysis technique was used to measure the area and perimeter of the damaged samples under impact. A multi-level full factorial design was implemented in this study as a systematic and efficient way to distinguish the interactions of more than one factor. Two levels of woven density (Type 1 and Type 2) were investigated and four levels of treatment percentage (0 %, 6 %, 9 % and 12 %) were examined. Moreover, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was employed to determine the significant factors that predominantly influence the impact behaviour of woven composites. It was found that the differences in woven density and woven treatment significantly affect the maximum impact load and deflection of woven coir-epoxy composites. Impact energy absorption, however, was only affected by <b>woven</b> treatment. <b>Factor</b> interactions were also apparent for maximum impact load, initiation energy and deflection. The results showed that woven reinforcement with denser structure was less stiff in nature. The deformability of the composites was also found to reduce with the increase of treatment percentage.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundMusculoskeletal pain (MSP) is {{a common}} and {{disabling}} problem among carpet weavers and is linked to physical and psychosocial factors of work. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of MSP, its psychosocial risk factors, and association of pain in each pair of anatomical sites among carpet weavers. MethodsA cross-sectional study was performed among 546 hand-woven carpet weavers in rural small-scale workshops of Iran. Data were collected by using parts of a standardized CUPID (Cultural and Psychosocial Influences on Disability) questionnaire focused on MSP in 10 body sites, including the low-back, neck, both right and left shoulders, elbows, wrists/hands, individual, physical and psychosocial risk factors. Statistical analysis was performed applying logistic regression models. ResultsPrevalence of MSP {{in at least one}} body site was 51. 7 % over the past month. The most common sites were low back and right shoulder pain 27. 4 % and 20. 1 %, respectively. A significant difference was found between the mean number of painful anatomical sites and the level of education, age, physical loading at work, time pressure, lack of support, and job dissatisfaction. In pairwise comparisons, strongest association was found between pain in each bilateral anatomical site (odds ratio =  11. 6 – 35. 3; p <  0. 001). ConclusionIn home-based workshops of carpet <b>weaving,</b> psychosocial <b>factors</b> and physical loading were associated with MSP. This finding is consistent with studies conducted among other jobs. Considering the preventive programs, the same amount of attention should be paid to psychosocial risk factors and physical loading. Also, further longitudinal studies are needed to investigate the relationship of psychological factors...|$|R

40|$|The {{main focus}} {{of this paper is}} aimed at a {{description}} {{of the relationship between the}} air permeability of woven fabric and its structure. The porosity of the fabric is divided into two basic types: horizontal and vertical porosity. The horizontal porosity is considered as a complement to the <b>woven</b> fabric cover <b>factor</b> – it is a two-dimensional model of poros-ity which is a projection of the fabric onto the horizontal plane. An elliptical model of the vertical pore is proposed for the description of vertical porosity, being a two-dimensional model of porosity as well, but it is a projection of the fabric onto the vertical plane. Two sets of woven fabrics (made of staple yarns) with different types of weave were used for the experiment. The correlation between the permeability values measured and vertical poros-ity values calculated was high. The method of multiple linear regression was used to derive a regression equation that allows to calculate the permeability based on the horizontal and vertical porosity. Then the correlation between the values of permeability measured and calculated was also high...|$|R

40|$|Health access {{behaviours}} {{of doctors}} {{need to be}} understood if the profession is to adequately respond to concerns raised about doctors’ health. There has been limited investigation of these issues and most qualitative studies have focussed on doctors who have been seriously unwell. This research project was designed to explore doctors’ attitudes to health access and the barriers they experience using six independently facilitated focus groups (37 general practitioners) in Brisbane, Australia. Themes that emerged using inductive thematic analysis were grouped into three key categories. The findings challenge current representations of doctors’ health within the medical literature. Doctors in this study reported positive attitudes towards their own health care. Health access, however, was difficult because of the barriers they encountered. These barriers are described in detail revealing the rationale used by doctors seeking care. A framework of patient, provider and profession barrier domains is developed to enable a comparison between the health access barriers of the doctor and those experienced by the general community. The complexity is highlighted as the socio-cultural <b>factors</b> <b>woven</b> through these barrier domains are recognised. The potential for this framework to provide a structure for future interventions to enhance doctors’ health access is discussed...|$|R

The findings of this research suggest that if other income generating activities are available, women seem to be less likely to weave for sale. This also appears to be true if women continue their educations beyond the eighth-grade level. Even so, a tradition of weaving, and the pride and creative outlet associated with being a good weaver may mean that some women will continue to weave for themselves. Also, high-end weaving may be able to generate enough income to be attractive labor even when other opportunities are available. Some women were found to alter traditional designs in order to suit the global market; others were not. This may be due to contact, or lack thereof, with consumers in the global market. The government appears to be withdrawing support from the weaving industry, although changes in policy in anticipation of accession to the EU may strengthen the industry. It seems as though the low-end weaving industry might disappear, but high-quality weaving may continue...|$|R

[...] University of Washington, 2014 Despite a {{prolific}} amount of available evidence-based practices (EBPs), {{health and mental}} health interventions have not been implemented as anticipated. Patients relegated to the core safety net, a subset of the safety net with a mission or legal mandate to care for vulnerable populations, face even greater obstacles to receiving evidence-based care. The fundamental research that has shaped current implementation models has been primarily outside the core safety net setting. Three qualitative studies, using grounded theory methodology, were undertaken to examine the processes and contextual influences unique to implementation of EBPs in the core safety net. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups of administrators and front line clinicians were employed to ascertain their experiences implementing three EBPs in three core safety net settings. Results in all three studies revealed challenging and beneficial contextual <b>factors</b> <b>woven</b> together in ways that the fabric of their combination supported the implementations, or possessed vulnerabilities that caused them to falter. Key findings across all studies were the importance of the following for successful implementation: intervention fit with characteristics and beliefs of patients, and needs of the community; intervention compatibility with the organization mission; intervention adaptability, quality, and observability; beliefs and behaviors of clinicians; adequate, dedicated clinical staffing; ongoing training and education; structural and cultural organizational assets; and ongoing network and system building...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. This thesis examines the urban graffiti subculture within the cities of New York and London. It was undertaken {{in an attempt to}} move beyond some of the negative stereotypes that characterise this subculture, its members and their illegal activities as inherently problematic, pointless and inane. Based on two years of ethnographic fieldwork in London and New York, it argues that graffiti is not senseless and mindless vandalism, but a pursuit that grants its mainly male and adolescent practitioners important and substantial rewards. Most notably these include fame, respect, autonomy, self direction and some sense of masculine status. Illegality is identified as the subcultural element underpinning these identity enhancing affordances. It is presented, firstly, as a masculine resource; a tool which young men can use to confront risk and danger and gain, through this, the recognition and respect of their peers and the defining elements of their masculine identities. Secondly, it is argued that adolescent subcultural members use their illegal status to promote societal rejection, discourage adult intervention and secure their subculture as a 'world apart'. This free space grants them autonomy, self direction and a chance to escape 'real life' and the problems and restraints which they may, as adolescents, experience there. On the basis of this, it is argued that three analytic revisions must be made if we are to understand this and other 'illegal' subcultures. First, we must move away from a passive model of delinquency. In this study, deviance is depicted as deliberate, functional and, thus, more than the consequence of an externally applied label. Second, we must move towards a more active model of identity construction. graffiti writers build and mould their identities through their illegal activities. This defines them as active agents rather than textual subjects who have merely taken up an inscribed position in a provided text or discourse. Third, we must look at what is being done in conjunction with who is doing it. Subcultural studies of the past have presented the subculture as a working class vehicle of resistance. However, they have rarely problematised its characteristically adolescent and masculine membership. Failure to include and analytically <b>weave</b> together <b>factors</b> of age, gender and illegality will, it is contended, result in a theoretically incomplete subcultural account...|$|R
40|$|Approaches {{to natural}} {{resource}} management are {{often based on}} a presumed ability to predict probabilistic responses to management and external drivers such as climate. They also tend {{to assume that the}} manager is outside the system being managed. However, where the objectives include long-term sustainability, linked social-ecological systems (SESs) behave as complex adaptive systems, with the managers as integral components of the system. Moreover, uncertainties are large and {{it may be difficult to}} reduce them as fast as the system changes. Sustainability involves maintaining the functionality of a system when it is perturbed, or maintaining the elements needed to renew or reorganize if a large perturbation radically alters structure and function. The ability to do this is termed "resilience. " This paper presents an evolving approach to analyzing resilience in SESs, as a basis for managing resilience. We propose a framework with four steps, involving close involvement of SES stakeholders. It begins with a stakeholder-led development of a conceptual model of the system, including its historical profile (how it got to be what it is) and preliminary assessments of the drivers of the supply of key ecosystem goods and services. Step 2 deals with identifying the range of unpredictable and uncontrollable drivers, stakeholder visions for the future, and contrasting possible future policies, <b>weaving</b> these three <b>factors</b> into a limited set of future scenarios. Step 3 uses the outputs from steps 1 and 2 to explore the SES for resilience in an iterative way. It generally includes the development of simple models of the system's dynamics for exploring attributes that affect resilience. Step 4 is a stakeholder evaluation of the process and outcomes in terms of policy and management implications. This approach to resilience analysis is illustrated using two stylized examples...|$|R

Various scientists suggest {{a variety of}} methods and technologies of manufacture of artificial prostheses. Innovative designs of woven implants are actively being developed. The main task {{of this study is to}} create new design options for elastic structure of woven hollow tube and to produce vascular implants to ensure the best incorporation of the synthetic implant into total vascular system of the body. Structure of these implants composed of several type textile filaments and special composition of impregnated biomaterials. Implant is manufactured by woven method as a woven hollow tube using special weaves. In the process of weaving were used polyester and polyurethane yarns. Innovative woven product has the necessary biomechanical properties: tensile strength; circumferentially and longitudial elastic deformation; modulus of elasticity. This woven tube is further processed, including impregnation with a solution of biologically compounds. Solutions with various viscosity and structure were used and different proportions were studied in the course of the previous experiment. Natural elastic membrane was formed on the porous wall of the implant and in the space between the fibers. As a result woven frame and special impregnation created a composite matrix. Such impregnation ensures zero hydro permeability of the wall of the <b>woven</b> prosthesis. This <b>factor</b> is especially important during the first hours and days after implantation. In such circumstances, the blood does not leak through the wall and significantly reduces the risk of hemorrhage. Such impregnation of implant also provides better biocompatibility with natural body tissues and the successful integration into the vascular circulatory system. Natural biological tissues grow into the walls of the implant. Neointima is formed on the inner wall into the lumen of the implant.
