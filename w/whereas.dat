5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the kth iteration, the variable b holds the latest remainder r'k−1, <b>whereas</b> the variable a holds its predecessor, r'k−2. The step b := a mod b is equivalent to the above recursion formula r'k ≡ r'k−2 mod r'k−1. The temporary variable t holds the value of r'k−1 while the next remainder r'k is being calculated. At the end of the loop iteration, the variable b holds the remainder r'k, <b>whereas</b> the variable a holds its predecessor, r'k−1.|$|E

5|$|Masked shrikes {{are most}} similar in {{appearance}} to woodchat shrikes, but are smaller, more slender and longer-tailed. Adults {{of the two}} species are easily distinguished, since the masked shrike has white on its head and a dark rump, <b>whereas</b> the woodchat shrike has a black crown, rusty nape and white rump. Juveniles are more similar, but the masked shrike has a longer tail, paler face, and grey back and rump, <b>whereas</b> the woodchat shrike has a sandy back and pale grey rump.|$|E
5|$|Masters, as Zissos points out, {{argues that}} the Sibyl's {{commands}} to bury Misenus and find the Golden Bough are inverted and compacted in Lucan: Erichtho needs a bodynot buriedbut rather retrieved. Many other parallels and inversions abound, including: the difference of opinions about the ease of getting what is sought from the underworld (the Sibyl says only the initial descent to the underworld will be easy, <b>whereas</b> Erichtho says necromancy is simple), the opposing manner in which those seeking information from the underworld are described (the Sibyl urges Aeneas to be courageous, <b>whereas</b> Erichtho criticizes Sextus Pompeius for being cowardly), and the inverted {{manner in which the}} supernatural rites proceed (the Sibyl sends Aeneas underground to gain knowledge, <b>whereas</b> Erichtho conjures a spirit up out of the ground to learn the future).|$|E
5|$|Of the subspecies, R. r. cottoni is the largest, <b>whereas</b> R. r. redunca is the smallest.|$|E
5|$|Plant anatomy is {{the study}} of the {{structure}} of plant cells and tissues, <b>whereas</b> plant morphology {{is the study}} of their external form.|$|E
5|$|Seeds {{and fruit}} form the major {{component}} of the diets of pigeons and doves. In fact, the family {{can be divided into}} the seed-eating or granivorous species (subfamily Columbinae) and the fruit-and-mast-eating or frugivorous species (the other four subfamilies). The granivorous species typically feed on seed found on the ground, <b>whereas</b> the frugivorous species tend to feed in trees. There are morphological adaptations {{that can be used to}} distinguish between the two groups: granivores tend to have thick walls in their gizzards, intestines, and esophagi <b>whereas</b> the frugivores tend to have thin walls. In addition, fruit-eating species have short intestines <b>whereas</b> those that eat seeds have longer ones. Frugivores are capable of clinging to branches and even hang upside down to reach fruit.|$|E

5|$|The {{complementary}} base to adenine in DNA is thymine, <b>whereas</b> in RNA, it is uracil, {{which is}} an unmethylated form of thymine.|$|E
5|$|The {{menstrual cycle}} can be {{described}} by the ovarian or uterine cycle. The ovarian cycle describes changes {{that occur in the}} follicles of the ovary <b>whereas</b> the uterine cycle describes changes in the endometrial lining of the uterus. Both cycles can be divided into three phases. The ovarian cycle consists of the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase <b>whereas</b> the uterine cycle consists of menstruation, proliferative phase, and secretory phase.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{the absence}} of crystal flaws is {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} quality of a diamond. Purity and high crystalline perfection make diamonds transparent and clear, <b>whereas</b> its hardness, optical dispersion (luster) and chemical stability (combined with marketing), make it a popular gemstone. High thermal conductivity is also important for technical applications. <b>Whereas</b> high optical dispersion is an intrinsic property of all diamonds, their other properties vary depending on how the diamond was created.|$|E
5|$|When {{moving through}} a fluid, {{rotating}} systems carry an efficiency advantage only at extremely low Reynolds numbers (i.e. viscosity-dominated flows) {{such as those}} experienced by bacterial flagella, <b>whereas</b> oscillating systems have the advantage at higher (inertia-dominated) Reynolds numbers. <b>Whereas</b> ship propellers typically have efficiencies around 60% and aircraft propellers up to around 80% (achieving 88% in the human-powered Gossamer Condor), much higher efficiencies, {{in the range of}} 96%–98%, can be achieved with an oscillating flexible foil like a fish tail or bird wing.|$|E
5|$|<b>Whereas</b> the {{original}} game introduced the F3600 anti-gravity racing league in 2052, Wipeout 2097 is set over four decades later and introduces the player to the much faster, more competitive, and more dangerous F5000 AG racing league. The game {{introduced a new}} damage interface and new weapons and tracks. The Sega Saturn version supported analogue control by using its 3D Control Pad, <b>whereas</b> the PlayStation version supported analogue control only through using the optional Negcon twist controller.|$|E
5|$|A ‘severe’ {{procedure}} would be, for instance, any test where {{death is}} the end-point or fatalities are expected, <b>whereas</b> a ‘mild’ procedure would be something like a blood test or an MRI scan.|$|E

5|$|Both Guggenheim–Katayama and Eötvös {{take into}} account the fact that surface tension reaches 0 at the {{critical}} temperature, <b>whereas</b> Ramay and Shields fails to match reality at this endpoint.|$|E
5|$|Doudna also {{proposes that}} Hyrcanus II {{was seen as}} the Teacher of Righteousness. According to Doudna, Hyrcanus II’s sectarian {{orientation}} is now generally understood to have been Sadducee; <b>whereas</b> Antigonus was more sympathetic towards the Pharisees.|$|E
5|$|During {{oxidative}} phosphorylation, electrons {{are transferred}} from electron donors to electron acceptors such as oxygen, in redox reactions. These redox reactions release energy, {{which is used}} to form ATP. In eukaryotes, these redox reactions are carried out by a series of protein complexes within the inner membrane of the cell's mitochondria, <b>whereas,</b> in prokaryotes, these proteins are located in the cells' intermembrane space. These linked sets of proteins are called electron transport chains. In eukaryotes, five main protein complexes are involved, <b>whereas</b> in prokaryotes many different enzymes are present, using a variety of electron donors and acceptors.|$|E

5|$|In humans, two {{different}} proteins can be associated in this position. In the cytoplasm of cells, Dis3L1 {{is associated with}} the exosome, <b>whereas</b> in the nucleus, Dis3 can bind to the core complex.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{also have}} a third eyelid known as a nictitating membrane, <b>whereas</b> most other {{primates}} have a lesser developed plica semilunaris. The nictitating membrane keeps the cornea moist and clean by sweeping across the eye.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} Galilean {{satellites}} and the Moon, Io rotates synchronously with its orbital period, keeping one face nearly pointed toward Jupiter. This synchronicity provides the definition for Io's longitude system. Io's prime meridian intersects the equator at the sub-Jovian point. The side of Io that always faces Jupiter {{is known as}} the subjovian hemisphere, <b>whereas</b> the side that always faces away {{is known as the}} antijovian hemisphere. The side of Io that always faces in the direction that Io travels in its orbit is known as the leading hemisphere, <b>whereas</b> the side that always faces in the opposite direction is known as the trailing hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Linear motions (or {{translatory}} motions), which {{move in a}} {{line between}} two points. Rectilinear motion is motion {{in a straight line}} between two points, <b>whereas</b> curvilinear motion is motion following a curved path.|$|E
5|$|Lithotrophic {{bacteria}} can use inorganic compounds {{as a source}} of energy. Common inorganic electron donors are hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ammonia (leading to nitrification), ferrous iron and other reduced metal ions, and several reduced sulfur compounds. In unusual circumstances, the gas methane can be used by methanotrophic bacteria as both a source of electrons and a substrate for carbon anabolism. In both aerobic phototrophy and chemolithotrophy, oxygen is used as a terminal electron acceptor, <b>whereas</b> under anaerobic conditions inorganic compounds are used instead. Most lithotrophic organisms are autotrophic, <b>whereas</b> organotrophic organisms are heterotrophic.|$|E
