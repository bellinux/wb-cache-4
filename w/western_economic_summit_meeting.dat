40|$|To open, it {{is perhaps}} {{worthwhile}} making some semantic distinctions. Macroeconomic coordination is a strong form of international economic cooperation, which can take many other forms, ranging up from the simple exchange of information among different governments to joint action to achieve a shared objective. Macroeconomic coordination can involve the coordination of targets of economic policy, as in the abortive OECD effort in 1974 - 75 to coordinate the current account objectives of its member countries following the first oil shock. More recently, we have seen some loose attempts to coordinate exchange rate targets. Or it can involve coordination in setting the instruments of economic policy, as for example the coordinated reduction in interest rates agreed at Chequers in 1967, or coordinated fiscal actions agreed at the Bonn <b>economic</b> <b>summit</b> <b>meeting</b> in 1978. The latter effort also involved trade and energy policies as well as fiscal policies. Moreover, coordination can be rule-based or process-oriented. Th...|$|R

Stray dogs were again transported from the city in preparation for the king's 2006 anniversary celebration, with efforts focusing on areas near expensive hotels where royal guests stayed. These strays were sent to the kennel in Uthai Thani, where it was planned they would stay until their death.|$|R
50|$|The unwillingness of the Yemeni {{government}} {{to warm up}} to Israel was largely due to pressure exerted by the opposition groups. The most vocal opponent of the government's attempts to reconcile with Israel was the Yemeni Reform Grouping. Yemen's Deputy Prime Minister, Abd-al-Wahhab al-Anisi, who headed the group that was a partner of the General People's Congress in the coalition government, stated that he had reservations regarding Yemen's participation in the <b>economic</b> <b>summit</b> <b>meeting</b> held in Amman {{at the end of}} 1995. He also stated that his party boycotted the visit of an Israeli Knesset delegation to Yemen. His party's position, he said, was that peace in the Middle East could not be established without securing the Palestinians right to an independent state. The YSP was no less critical of the government's policy. It repeatedly called upon the {{government to}} refrain from participating in any event which Israel was represented. In August 1997, it urged the government to boycott the Middle East and North Africa <b>economic</b> <b>summit</b> scheduled for November that year in Qatar, if Israel did not take serious measures toward a lasting peace. Parliamentary speaker Abdullah al-Ahmar said that those countries who decided to attend the summit would be serving Israel's interests. Yemen's opposition parties became more vocal during the summer of 1997, when Israel's right-wing Likud government did not show willingness to accelerate the peace process.|$|R

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis named "Summits between USA and USSR in 1985 and 1988 in Czechoslovakian Press" {{deals with}} {{the presentation of the}} <b>summit</b> <b>meetings</b> in Geneva and Moscow in contemporary Czechoslovakian newspapers and compares it with regard to the development of relations between the two superpowers and the change in the media environment of the Soviet bloc. In the theory section the thesis provides relevant historical context of the theme, such as information on censorship in Czechoslovakia or the policy of Glasnost, and characterizes both the monitored periodicals and the <b>summit</b> <b>meetings</b> between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, which took place {{in the second half of}} 1980 's. The practical part covers detailed qualitative content analysis of the selected Czechoslovakian press, that is the Rudé právo, Zemědělské noviny and Svobodné slovo dailies. The presentation of the <b>summit</b> <b>meetings</b> is then summarized with regard to the employed journalist techniques, the topics covered in contemporary periodicals and the characteristics of the <b>summit</b> <b>meetings</b> in specialized literature.

40|$|M. A. In the {{institutional}} framework {{which was created}} by the Treaty of Rome for the European Community, no provision was made for heads of government to play any role in the new supranational dispensation. Governments would have to fulfil their roles only in the Council of Ministers. <b>Summit</b> <b>Meetings</b> therefore developed outside the Treaty of Rome and with passage of time, gained greater power and influence. As a result there are some who erroneously argue that Summitry has no proper place in Community proceedings and is some sort of constitutional aberration. From the initial outset {{it was clear that the}} development of the <b>Summit</b> <b>Meetings</b> in the European Community would for various reasons be controversial. The <b>Summit</b> <b>Meetings</b> are, however, now organised on a much firmer base with the result that in this study they can be viewed with greater perspective and insight. The purpose of this study is therefore to research and draw conclusions on the following matters: Detailed research was carried out on all Community <b>Summit</b> <b>Meetings</b> held between 1960 and 1980 with the aim of establishing the various agendas and the decisions reached. The development of <b>Summit</b> <b>Meetings</b> can roughly be divided into three stages. During each particular period specific matters enjoyed priority and currently Summitry in the form of the European Council, deliberates over a large and divergent spectrum of issues. The three stages are: An "extra institutional period", covering the years 1961 to 1967. <b>Summit</b> <b>Meetings</b> were viewed as outside the Community institutions and not of any particular significance...|$|R

40|$|Today {{the claims}} of Abya Yala’s {{indigenous}} and aboriginal women are positioned within Latin American’s indigenous agenda. Their participation in the indigenous movement and their own organizational processes as women led to the Continental Indigenous Women’s <b>Summit</b> <b>Meeting</b> of Abya Yala (Cumbre Continental de Mujeres Indígenas del Abya Yala, CCMI) which has been held twice in the region in 2009 in Puno Peru and in 2013 in La María Piendamó Colombia. In this paper, we analyze the processes of emergence, articulation, consolidation and integration challenges of Abya Yala’s indigenous and aboriginal women into the Continental Indigenous Women’s <b>Summit</b> <b>Meeting</b> of Abya Yala, a successful process of constructing networks and solidarities. Through these summits, the specific claims of indigenous women have reached the international indigenous agenda, feminist and women’s movements, promoting their organization and empowerment. As observers in the second <b>summit</b> <b>meeting</b> and analyzing existing literature, we examine the actors that favored the process of emergence, how {{the first and second}} <b>summit</b> <b>meetings</b> were held, and debates and selection of the topics. We also discuss indigenous women’s relationship with feminism which influenced in some way or the other the processes that led to the <b>summit</b> <b>meetings.</b> Finally, we address the challenges of this organizational space of empowerment managed and constituted by indigenous and aboriginal women of the continent...|$|R
