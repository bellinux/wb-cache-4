5|$|Napoleon's Imperial Guard, {{the only}} unit on the {{battlefield}} that saw no fighting, <b>was</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> swing into action at a moment's notice.

5|$|At {{the time}} of the North Korean invasion, the closest American ground force was the 24th Infantry Division, which was based in Japan. This {{division}} had fewer than its normal contingent of soldiers, and most of its equipment was rather old due to the U.S. Congress's reductions in military spending. In any case, the 24th Infantry Division was {{the only part of the}} U.S. Army that <b>was</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> quickly reinforce South Korea.|$|E

5|$|Concorde {{needed to}} fly long {{distances}} to be economically viable; this required high efficiency from the powerplant. Turbofan engines were rejected {{due to their}} larger cross-section producing excessive drag. Olympus turbojet technology <b>was</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> be developed to meet the design requirements of the aircraft, although turbofans would be studied for any future SST.|$|E
5|$|David Bunnell joined MITS as a {{technical}} writer in the calculator heyday. In April 1975 he created a newsletter so the MITS staff could easily communicate with the customers. The newsletter, Computer Notes, <b>was</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> customers and other interested readers. It was a large format newsletter; 11.25 by 15.5inches (286 by 394mm), and each issue had 8 to 24 pages. In January 1977, it switched to a smaller magazine format and the last issue was produced in January 1978. Bunnell started Personal Computer magazine in October 1976 {{and went on to}} a successful career as a magazine publisher.|$|E

5|$|Forty leagues (120nautical {{miles or}} around 220km) {{to the east}} of Surinam, Low and his fleet of two ships (the Rose Pink and the Fancy, captained by a young Charles Harris) dropped anchor to remove growth such as seaweed and {{barnacles}} from the outside of the boats, in a process known as careening, necessary because no dry dock <b>was</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> pirates.|$|E
5|$|GRBs {{were first}} {{detected}} in 1967 by the Vela satellites, {{which had been}} designed to detect covert nuclear weapons tests. Following their discovery, hundreds of theoretical models were proposed to explain these bursts, such as collisions between comets and neutron stars. Little information <b>was</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> verify these models until the 1997 detection of the first X-ray and optical afterglows and direct measurement of their redshifts using optical spectroscopy, and thus their distances and energy outputs. These discoveries, and subsequent studies of the galaxies and supernovae associated with the bursts, clarified the distance and luminosity of GRBs, definitively placing them in distant galaxies.|$|E

5|$|Life in a workhouse was {{intended}} to be harsh, to deter the able-bodied poor and to ensure that only the truly destitute would apply. But in areas such as the provision of free medical care and education for children, neither of which <b>was</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> the poor in England living outside workhouses until the early 20th century, workhouse inmates were advantaged over the general population, a dilemma that the Poor Law authorities never managed to reconcile.|$|E

To continue their advertising campaign, Twitter announced on March 20, 2012, that promoted tweets would be introduced to mobile devices.

5|$|Three {{possible}} excavation {{sites were}} identified: the staff car park of Leicester City Council Social Services, the disused playground {{of the former}} Alderman Newton's School and a public car park on New Street. It was decided to open two trenches in the Social Services car park, with an option for a third in the playground. Because most of the Greyfriars site had been built on, only seventeen per cent of its former area <b>was</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> excavate; the area to be investigated amounted to just one per cent of the site, owing to {{the limitations of the}} project's funding.|$|E
5|$|To ensure accuracy, Tayler {{arranged}} sittings {{with each}} member of the Kent team and made an effort to paint each one true to life. He initially planned to include non-striking Lancashire batsman Harry Makepeace, but when Makepeace was unable to attend a sitting, Tayler used another Lancashire player, William Findlay, as the batsman. Findlay had not actually played in that particular match, but he <b>was</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> visit Tayler's London studio as he had been newly appointed secretary of the Surrey County Cricket Club after his retirement from active cricket competition at the end of 1906.|$|E
5|$|A {{review of}} olivaceous warbler records {{commenced}} in 1986, and {{continued through the}} 1990s. The results of this review were published in 1999: six of the previously accepted records were rejected as not meeting modern identification standards. In 2003, following the split of olivaceous warbler into two species, the accepted records were all reviewed again to ascertain {{which of the two}} they wereall nine proved to be eastern olivaceous warblers. Following the split of Bonelli's warbler into two species, the committee reviewed all the 121 accepted records, and concluded that 51 were western and two were eastern; for the remainder, not enough evidence <b>was</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> make a firm decision. The committee had previously stated that it would regard as western Bonelli's warbler all except proven eastern Bonelli's warblers, however, this announcement rescinded that decision. In 2003–04, all desert warbler records were reviewed, and it was concluded that all were referable to the newly split Asian desert warbler, rather than African desert warbler.|$|E

5|$|A total {{prize money}} pot of US$245,000 <b>was</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> athletes at the championships, with awards being given those placing from first to sixth {{in both the}} {{individual}} and team sections. The amounts on offer for each competition were equal across the sexes. The top prize for the individual race winners was $30,000, while the three athletes in the winning teams earned a share of $15,000. A further $50,000 was provided as in incentive for runners who improved upon the half marathon world record mark, but ultimately this award was not claimed at the 2010 championships. All athletes receiving prize money needed to submit to – and pass – a doping test in order to claim their award.|$|E
5|$|Allen {{was born}} in Australia {{and grew up in}} England from the age of six. After playing cricket for Eton College, he went to Cambridge University where he {{established}} a reputation as a fast bowler, albeit one who was often injured. After leaving university, Allen played mainly for Middlesex. He improved as a batsman in the following seasons until work commitments forced him to play less regularly. A change of career allowed him to play more cricket, and by the late 1920s he {{was on the verge of}} the England Test team. He made his debut in 1930, and remained in contention for a place, when he <b>was</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> play, for the rest of the decade. During the controversial Bodyline tour of 1932–33, Allen was very successful for England but refused to use the intimidatory tactics employed by his teammates.|$|E
5|$|Although Tyler's {{family was}} dear to him, during his {{political}} rise {{he was often}} {{away from home for}} extended periods. When Tyler chose not to seek re-election to the House of Representatives in 1821 because of illness, he nevertheless expressed concern as he anticipated the proper education his growing family. While in office it was difficult to practice law being away in Washington part of the year, and his plantation was also more profitable when Tyler <b>was</b> <b>available</b> <b>to</b> manage it himself. By the time he entered the Senate in 1827, he had resigned himself to spending part of the year away from his family. Still, he sought to remain close to his children through letters.|$|E
