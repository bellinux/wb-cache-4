25|$|The jacket harness is a {{waistcoat}} (vest) style garment {{with strong}} adjustable <b>webbing</b> <b>straps</b> which are adjustable and securely buckled over the shoulders, across {{the chest and}} waist, and through the crotch or around each thigh, so that the diver can not slide out under any predictable circumstance. The harness is fitted with several heavy duty D-rings, fixed to the webbing {{in such a way}} that the full weight of the diver and all his equipment can be safely supported. A minimum strength of 500kgf is recommended or required by some codes of practice. A jacket harness is usually provided with <b>webbing</b> <b>straps</b> or a cloth pocket on the back to support the bailout cylinder, and may have a variety of pockets to carry tools, and may also carry ditchable or fixed main weights. There are usually several strong D-rings to secure the umbilical and other equipment.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} version are two-sided bags, either joined {{round the}} edges or folded and joined along two sides. <b>Webbing</b> <b>straps</b> may be stitched to doubler patches {{which are then}} glued or welded to the bag on light duty bags, but on large and heavy duty bags there are usually strips of bag material bonded to the bags which form flat retaining tubes for the webbing which is threaded through the tubes and may be withdrawn for maintenance and inspection. heavy duty open bags are generally conical with a domed top or a reversed truncated cone top, and may have several straps from the lifting point at the bottom, through the guide tubes on the sides, to a crown ring of webbing or steel at the top, to spread the load evenly over {{the fabric of the}} bag.|$|E

50|$|PALS {{consists}} of webbing sewn onto the load-bearing equipment and corresponding webbing and straps on the attachment. The straps are interwoven between the webbing {{on each of}} two pieces and finally snapped into place, making for a very secure fit which can be detached with moderate effort. New types are laser cut out of single piece fabric rather than <b>webbing</b> <b>straps</b> sewn onto fabric. This is common on many new tactical items from backpacks to chest rigs. The spacing is the same standard so new lasercut ladders are 100% backwards compatible with older pouches made for webbing strap construction rigs.|$|E

5000|$|A knot is {{a method}} of {{fastening}} or securing linear material such as rope by tying or interweaving. It may consist of a length of one or several segments of rope, string, <b>webbing,</b> twine, <b>strap,</b> or even chain interwoven such that the line can bind to itself or to some other object (the [...] "load"). Knots {{have been the subject}} of interest for their ancient origins, their common uses, and the area of mathematics known as knot theory.|$|R
5000|$|Travel or camping hammocks {{are popular}} among leave no trace and ultra light campers, hikers, and sailing enthusiasts for their reduced {{impact on the}} {{environment}} and their lightness and lack of bulk compared to tents. They are typically made of sturdy nylon parachute fabric which may use ripstop techniques to improve durability. Some hammocks feature a mosquito net and storage pockets. Some types offer a ridgeline to make set up easier, and may also include a slit for entry through the bottom of the hammock. Special <b>webbing</b> <b>straps</b> (called [...] "treehuggers") are used to loop around trees in order to create attachment points for the hammock.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the unique}} {{concepts}} of hammock camping is the new diversity of suspension systems and add-ons which campers use in making their hammock set-up unique and functional. The line on which the hammock's weight is held is often swapped {{for a variety of}} lighter weight suspension made of Dyneema or other UHMWPE material. These reduce both weight and bulk. Many use similar lines formed into a constriction knot (colloquially referred to by the brand name [...] "Whoopie Slings") for quick adjustment and setup. These may be connected to the <b>webbing</b> <b>straps</b> ("Tree Huggers") using a lightweight toggle or a carabiner, or more uniquely designed connectors such as Dutch Clips or Tri-Glides.|$|E
50|$|Both Waugh and Henriques briefly {{describe}} dud officers, full of ego, spit and polish, {{and military}} stupidity. Henriques describes Colonel Charlie Chapman, with monocle and fussy false teeth. He {{takes over the}} Territorial artillery unit, has a pedant’s eye for the colour of blanco (pipe-clay applied to canvas <b>webbing</b> <b>straps</b> and belts), gun-firing drills run by formula (without live ammunition), and the preposterous details of obsolete regulation books. And he has a fundamental misunderstanding of the risks, or not, of German attack across impossible beaches - something that Barry, the far from competent captain, sees at a glance, based on his experience of sailing:“I happen to know a bit about beaches. I happen to like sailing …”“I happen to be no end of a swell at tiddly-winks,” the brigadier said (p 183) … sometimes Henriques is as hilariously satirical, and poignant, as Waugh.|$|E
50|$|Most jackets {{feature a}} crotch-strap {{to prevent the}} jacket from simply being pulled up and off. Some bear loops at the front and/or sides; the sleeves are {{threaded}} through these to prevent the arms from being raised over the head.

25|$|The {{simplest}} backpack {{design is}} a bag {{attached to a}} set of shoulder straps. Such packs are used for general transportation of goods, and have variable capacity. The simplest designs consist of one main pocket. This may be combined with <b>webbing</b> or cordage <b>straps,</b> while more sophisticated models add extra pockets, waist straps, chest straps, padded shoulder straps, padded backs, and sometimes reflective materials for added safety at night. These packs are generally produced inexpensively.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this project is to improve upon the current stitching pattern used in UAV catch net applications {{with the intention of}} lengthening their useable life cycle. To achieve this, a testing setup and procedure has been developed to produce material strength and stiffness data for nylon­ <b>webbing</b> <b>strap,</b> and for sewn intersections of the same strap material. The current stitching pattern was tested, and quantitatively characterized based on strength and stiffness. New stitching designs were generated and tested using the same procedure, and the results compared. This allowed for the selection of the most optimized stitching pattern that achieves the longest life without failure of the stitching or the base material (webbing). Our testing procedure is comprised of two main tensile tests; one that tests the stitching intersection in shear failure, and the other in peel failure. Force and displacement data is output through the data acquisition system for each of the tests, which yields stress­ strain data that can be analyzed to characterize the relative strength and stiffness of each setup. The test procedure outlines in detail the loading of the test specimen into the machine, the setup for the machine, and the setup for the data acquisition system. Our stitching pattern redesign begins with a failure model based on theoretical assumptions about how each independent stitched joint is loaded. This theoretical analysis is complimented by our experimental data, to determine what characteristics contribute to the strength of the stitching pattern. The main design goal is to improve the design in peel failure, which is the primary failure mode for nets currently in use. Pattern redesign is an ongoing and iterative process; and thus, additional testing iterations could result in an even more improved design...|$|R

5000|$|A minimalist form of softpack harness {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the [...] "Capepac" [...] {{is a set of}} <b>webbing</b> <b>straps</b> much like that of the backplate, but with a webbing strap instead of the plate. This strap may be formed by stitching or threading through sliders a double layer of webbing with slots between the layers which the cambands pass through, and the wing is sandwiched between harness and cylinder. There is no need for a plate, as the cylinder forms the rigid part of the assembly. This arrangement is best suited to single cylinders, and can be made very compact and light for travelling. In some cases a stabiliser plate may be included {{at the base of the}} vertical strap, and the harness shoulder and waistband straps thread through this as is done on the standard backplate.|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{appeal of}} hammock camping for most users is comfort and better sleep, as {{compared}} to sleeping on a pad on the ground. Hammock camping enthusiasts argue that hammocks don't harm the environment {{in the way that}} conventional tents do. Most hammocks attach to trees via removable <b>webbing</b> <b>straps,</b> or [...] "tree-huggers," [...] which don't damage the bark and leave little or no marks afterward. Whereas it's easy to see a frequently used campground because of the effect on the grass, scrub and topsoil, the presence of a hammock camping site is much harder to detect. This has found favour with hikers and campers who follow the principles of Leave No Trace camping. Hammock camping also opens up many more sites for campers - stony ground, slopes, and so on - as well as keeping them off the ground and away from small mammals, reptiles and insects. Sleeping off the ground also keeps the camper out of any rainwater runoff that might seep in under a tent during a downpour. Lastly, the relatively light weight of hammocks makes them ideal for reducing backpack weight, thereby making it a good option for ultralight backpacking enthusiasts.|$|E
50|$|Another {{form of an}} armbinder {{consists}} {{of the use of}} cuffs and straps to hold the arms {{to the side of the}} body, or in front or back of the body. A series of cuffs, which can be made from various material such as leather or metal, are placed on the arms at various points such as the wrists and elbows. These cuffs are then linked together with a <b>webbing</b> of <b>straps,</b> or a series of rods, to hold the arms in a particular position. To improve strength, as well as ease of use, all the cuffs and straps are typically linked together, hence why the complete piece of equipment is considered an armbinder. Another form uses a single rod, with the cuffs attached at regular distances down its length, and sometimes also including a collar at the top to hold the rod in place.|$|R
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} locking {{retractors}} {{is to provide}} the seated occupant the convenience of some free movement of the upper torso within the compartment, while providing a method of limiting this movement {{in the event of}} a crash. Most modern seat belts are stowed on spring-loaded reels called [...] "retractors" [...] equipped with inertial locking mechanisms that stop the belt from extending off the reel during severe deceleration. There are two main types of inertial seat belt lock. A webbing-sensitive lock is based on a centrifugal clutch activated by rapid acceleration of the <b>strap</b> (<b>webbing)</b> from the reel. The belt can be pulled from the reel only slowly and gradually, as when the occupant extends the belt to fasten it. A sudden rapid pull of the belt—as in a sudden braking or collision event—causes the reel to lock, restraining the occupant in position.|$|R
5000|$|From 1936, the Mark I Brodie helmet {{was fitted}} with an {{improved}} liner and an elasticated (actually, sprung) <b>webbing</b> chin <b>strap.</b> This final variant served until late 1940, {{when it was}} superseded by the slightly modified Mk II, which served the British and Commonwealth forces throughout World War II. Several Commonwealth nations, such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa, produced local versions of the MK II, which can be distinguished from those made in Britain. During this period, the helmet was also used by the police, the fire brigade and ARP wardens in Britain. The helmets for the ARP wardens came in two principal variants, black with a white [...] "W" [...] for wardens and white with a black [...] "W" [...] for Chief Wardens; however numerous different patterns were used. A civilian pattern was also available for private purchase, known as the Zuckerman helmet, which was a little deeper but made from ordinary mild steel.The Norwegian Army adopted the Mark I helmet in 1915, eventually importing a total of 10,000 examples. Some of the imported helmets had a helmet plate with the Norwegian coat of arms affixed to the front. The Mark I remained in Norwegian service throughout the interwar period, alongside Swedish helmets acquired in the 1930s. The helmets were among the equipment issued to Norwegian forces in World War II, seeing service in the 1940 Norwegian Campaign against invading German forces. In the first post-war years, the Mark I helmet remained in service with the Norwegian Army, alongside the American M1 helmet, Swedish helmets, and Stahlhelms {{left behind by the}} capitulated German occupation forces.In 1944, the British suplemented it with a significantly modified design, known as the Mk III [...] "Turtle" [...] helmet.|$|R

25|$|The {{internal}} frame backpack {{is a recent}} innovation, invented in 1967 by Greg Lowe, {{who went on to}} found Lowe Alpine and Lowepro, companies specializing in backpacks and other forms of carrying bags for various equipment. An internal-frame pack has a large fabric section around an {{internal frame}} composed of strips of either aluminum, titanium or plastic, sometimes with additional metal stays to reinforce the frame. A complex series of straps works with the frame to distribute the weight and hold it in place. The internal frame permits the pack to fit closely to the wearer's back and minimizes shifting of the load, which is desirable when participating in activities that involve upper-body movement such as scrambling over rocky surfaces and skiing. However, the tight fit reduces ventilation, so these type of packs tend to be more sweaty than external frame packs. The internal construction also allows for a large storage compartment; a few lash points (including <b>webbing</b> loops and <b>straps</b> for sleeping bags and other large items) may be present, but as the frame is completely integrated, it is difficult to securely lash larger and heavier items which do not fit inside the compartment to the outside of the pack. Internal frame packs originally suffered from smaller load capacity and less comfortable fit during steady walking, but newer models have improved greatly in these respects. In addition, because of their snug fit, the improved internal frame models have largely replaced external frame backpacks for many activities.|$|R
