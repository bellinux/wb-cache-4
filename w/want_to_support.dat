His nomination did take place {{but did not}} receive the majority of votes due to the opposition of Sforza and his faction. The Spanish did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> him either. Although Colonna was one of Philip II choice, unofficially it was known that both he and Gallio were not popular in Madrid and their election {{was going to be}} an extremity.|$|E
25|$|On August 7, 2013, Carmack joined Oculus VR {{as their}} CTO. On November 22, 2013, he {{resigned}} from id Software to work full-time at Oculus VR. Carmack's reason for leaving was because id's parent company ZeniMax Media didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> Oculus Rift. Carmack's role at both companies later became central to a ZeniMax lawsuit against Oculus parent company Facebook, claiming that Oculus stole ZeniMax's virtual reality intellectual property. The trial jury absolved Carmack of liability, though Oculus and other corporate officers were {{held liable for}} trademark, copyright, and contract violations. In February 2017 Carmack sued ZeniMax, claiming the company had refused to pay him the remaining $22.5 million owed him from their purchase of id Software.|$|E
25|$|During the Indochina War, Diệm {{and other}} non-communist nationalists {{had to face}} a dilemma: {{they did not want}} to restore colonial rule and did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the Việt Minh. Diệm proclaimed his {{neutrality}} and attempted to establish a Third Force movement that was both anti-colonialist and anti-communist In 1947, he became the founder and chief of the National Union Bloc (Khối Quốc Gia Liên Hiệp) and then folded it into the group Vietnam National Rally (Việt Nam Quốc Gia Liên Hiệp), which gathered non-communist Vietnamese nationalists. He also established the relationships with some leading Vietnamese anti-communists like Nguyễn Tôn Hoàn (1917–2001), a fellow Catholic and political activist. His other allies and advisors were dominated by the Catholics, especially his family's members and their friends.|$|E

25|$|Because of Georgia's need {{to supply}} a booming {{population}} with safe, usable water, Georgia's circumstance {{is unique to}} the three states involved. The interstate water dispute becomes an intrastate issue for Georgia because of the major quantities of water needed for supporting population growth in the metro Atlanta. The growth of Atlanta has also increased water consumption for maintaining lawns and golf courses, which other parties to the rivers do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>support.</b> Lake Lanier's downstream users in Georgia maintain that {{an increase in the}} water consumption of metro Atlanta results in a decrease of available water for users in south Georgia. Farmers in Southwest Georgia and homeowners on West Point Lake perceive metro Atlanta as competition for water.|$|E
25|$|Relations with Nicaragua {{had also}} become more difficult, {{especially}} after civil conflict had increased in that {{nation in the}} late 1970s. In March 1978, Honduran soldiers captured Germán Pomares, {{a leader of the}} Sandinista National Liberation Front (Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional, FSLN), the guerrilla force fighting against the regime of Anastasio Somoza Debayle in Nicaragua. Pomares was held until the end of June, but Nicaraguan requests for extradition were denied, and he was ultimately flown to Panama. As fighting in Nicaragua escalated in 1978 and early 1979, Honduras found itself in a difficult position. Honduras did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> the unpopular Somoza regime but feared the Marxist leanings of the FSLN. In addition, beginning in September 1978, Honduras had become burdened with an ever-growing number of refugees from Nicaragua.|$|E
25|$|From September 1953 onwards, {{both the}} Avro 720 and the SR.53 {{projects}} were subject increasingly levels of scrutiny amid an overall requirement within the Ministry to implement cuts {{in order to}} reduce costs. However, the Avro 720 was dealt an effective death blow when the Screamer rocket engine which powered the interceptor was cancelled during late 1956. Reportedly, official concerns regarding the practicality of using liquid oxygen, which boils at -183°C (90 K) and is a fire hazard, within an operational environment had heavily contributed to the Screamer's cancellation. The loss of the main engine in turn ultimately led to the termination of the Avro 720. One {{of the reasons for the}} Ministry's preferment of the SR.53, despite its development programme being comparatively behind and having suffered greater delays, was its rocket engine's use of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidiser had been viewed as less problematic than the Screamer's liquid oxygen oxidiser, and the Ministry did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> two separate rocket fuel programmes.|$|E

500|$|Ever {{since its}} foundation, other parties have {{consistently}} refused the Progress Party's efforts to join any governing coalition {{at the state}} level. The reasons have mainly included concerns about the party's alleged irresponsibility and its position on immigration issues. Following the increased support and importance of the Progress Party in the 2005 elections, the Conservative Party stated {{they wanted to be}} [...] "a bridge between the Progress Party and the centre." [...] This is because the centrist Liberal Party and Christian Democratic Party reject the possibility of participating in a government coalition together with the Progress Party. In addition, the Progress Party does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> a government coalition that it itself is not a part of. In 2010, the Conservative Party went even further when its leader Erna Solberg stated that the Progress Party was now such a big party that it [...] "must" [...] be part of any centre-right governmental negotiations after the 2013 elections. At the municipal level, the Progress Party however cooperates with most parties, including the Labour Party. In 2007 it also attracted some unusual attention when the local Porsgrunn Progress Party was involved in some limited cooperation with the Socialist Left Party and the Red Party.|$|E
500|$|In November 1988, Guns N' Roses {{released}} the stopgap album G N' R Lies, which {{sold more than}} five million copies in the U.S. alone. The band – and Rose in particular – were accused of promoting racist and homophobic attitudes with the song [...] "One in a Million", in which Rose warns [...] "niggers" [...] to [...] "get out of my way" [...] and complains about [...] "faggots" [...] who [...] "spread some fucking disease". During the controversy, Rose defended {{his use of the}} racial slur by claiming that [...] "it's a word to describe somebody that is basically a pain in your life, a problem. The word nigger doesn't necessarily mean black." [...] In 1992, however, he conceded that he had used the word as an insult towards black people, stating, [...] "I was pissed off about some black people that were trying to rob me. I wanted to insult those particular black people. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>support</b> racism." [...] In response to the allegations of homophobia, Rose stated that he considered himself [...] "pro-heterosexual" [...] and blamed this attitude on [...] "bad experiences" [...] with gay men, citing an attempted rape in his late teens and the alleged molestation by his biological father. The controversy led to Guns N' Roses being dropped from the roster of an AIDS benefit show in New York organized by the Gay Men's Health Crisis.|$|E

Their interest in multi-platform development was made clear in 2008 when the previously PlayStation 3-exclusive game Final Fantasy XIII was announced for release on the Xbox 360.|$|E
