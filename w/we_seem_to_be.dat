Krishna {{wrote that the}} film [...] "deserves to be vastly {{appreciated}} as an earnest endeavor to portray with sensitivity and empathetically diagnose a malady in human life". They also felt it blended [...] "modern professional knowledge" [...] with a [...] "humane approach" [...] in working with a dyslexic child. However, the authors believed the film expands beyond disabilities and explores the [...] "present age where everyone is in a restless hurry". The pair wrote, [...] "This film raises serious questions on mental health perspectives. <b>We</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> heading {{to a state of}} mass scale mindlessness even as children are being pushed to 'perform'. Are we seriously getting engrossed in the race of 'achievement' and blissfully becoming numb to the crux of life i.e., experiencing meaningful living in a broader frame rather than merely existing?" [...] The film depicts how [...] "threats and coercion are not capable of unearthing rich human potentialities deeply embedded in children", and that teachers should instead map their strengths and weakness. With this in mind, the author felt that Khan [...] "dexterously drives home the precise point that our first priority ought to be getting to know the child before making any efforts to fill them with knowledge and abilities". Overall, the pair found a [...] "naive oversimplification" [...] in the film. With India [...] "only recently waking to recognizing the reality and tragedy of learning disability", however, they [...] "easily [...] under artistic license".|$|E

2500|$|Apparitional {{experiences}} {{also have}} implications for the philosophy of perception. [...] The occurrence of hallucinations, that is, perceptual experiences 'having the character of sense perception, but without relevant or adequate sensory stimulation ', have long {{been one of the}} standard objections to the philosophical theory of direct realism. According to this theory we are in some sense in direct contact with the external world when <b>we</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> perceiving it, and not merely in direct contact with some mediating representation in our mind, such as a sense-datum or an image, {{which may or may not}} correspond to external reality. [...] The psychologist J.J. Gibson, referred to above, became an advocate of the philosophical theory of direct realism.|$|E

2500|$|Eighteenth Men. (Chapters 15–16) The most {{advanced}} humans of all, essentially a perfected {{version of the}} 17th species. A race of philosophers and artists with a very liberal sexual morality. [...] "Superficially <b>we</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> not one species but many." [...] (One interesting aspect of the Eighteenth Men {{is that they have}} a number of different [...] "sub-genders," [...] variants on the basic male and female pattern, with distinctive temperaments. The Eighteenth Men's equivalent of the family unit includes one of each of these sub-genders and is the basis of their society. The units have the ability to act as a group mind, which eventually leads to the establishment of a single group mind uniting the entire species.). This species no longer died naturally, but only by accident, suicide or being killed. Despite their hyper-advanced civilisation, they practice ritual cannibalism. They are eventually extinguished on Neptune after a supernova infects the sun, causing it to grow so hot that it consumes the remains of the solar system, faster than any means of escape they can devise. Unable to escape, this last species of man devises a virus to spread life to other worlds and cause the evolution of new sentient species throughout the galaxy.|$|E
