5|$|The Rhodes piano (also {{known as}} the Fender Rhodes piano or simply Fender Rhodes or Rhodes) is an {{electric}} piano invented by Harold Rhodes, which became particularly popular throughout the 1970s.

5|$|The channel-billed cuckoo (Scythrops novaehollandiae) parasitizes pied currawong nests, laying eggs <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>then</b> {{raised by}} the unsuspecting foster parents. The eggs closely {{resemble}} those of the currawong hosts. Pied currawongs {{have been known to}} desert nests once cuckoos have visited, abandoning the existing currawong young, which die, and a channel-billed cuckoo has been recorded decapitating a currawong nestling. The brown goshawk (Accipiter fasciatus) and lace monitor (Varanus varius) have also been recorded taking nestlings.|$|E
5|$|The fan-tailed cuckoo (Cacomantis flabelliformis) and pallid cuckoo (C.pallidus) {{have been}} {{recorded}} as brood parasites of the flame robin; female cuckoos lay their eggs in robin nests, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>then</b> raised by the robins as their own. One fan-tailed cuckoo was recorded ejecting baby robins before being raised by its foster parents. Other nest predators recorded include the grey shrikethrush (Colluricincla harmonica), pied currawong (Strepera graculina), and eastern brown snake (Pseudonaja textilis).|$|E
5|$|Because DNA {{collects}} mutations over time, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>then</b> inherited, {{it contains}} historical information, and, by comparing DNA sequences, geneticists can infer the evolutionary history of organisms, their phylogeny. This field of phylogenetics {{is a powerful}} tool in evolutionary biology. If DNA sequences within a species are compared, population geneticists can learn the history of particular populations. This {{can be used in}} studies ranging from ecological genetics to anthropology; For example, DNA evidence is being used to try to identify the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel.|$|E

5|$|During HBV infection, {{the host}} immune {{response}} causes both hepatocellular damage and viral clearance. Although the innate immune response does {{not play a}} significant role in these processes, the adaptive immune response, in particular virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTLs), contributes to most of the liver injury associated with HBV infection. CTLs eliminate HBV infection by killing infected cells and producing antiviral cytokines, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>then</b> used to purge HBV from viable hepatocytes. Although liver damage is initiated and mediated by the CTLs, antigen-nonspecific inflammatory cells can worsen CTL-induced immunopathology, and platelets activated at the site of infection may facilitate the accumulation of CTLs in the liver.|$|E
5|$|End of Ages {{has several}} {{features}} {{designed to help}} players complete puzzles. To recall clues or important items, players can use a camera feature to take screenshots, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>then</b> placed in a journal the player can access at any time. Player interactions with other characters are similarly recalled via another journal; everything a character tells the player is stored and can be viewed at any time. Journal pages are narrated by {{the voice of the}} character, and missing pages of the journal appear translucent in menus.|$|E
5|$|Especially in warmer areas, {{the house}} sparrow may build its nests in the open, on the {{branches}} of trees, especially evergreens and hawthorns, or in the nests of large birds such as storks or magpies. In open nesting sites, breeding success tends to be lower, since breeding begins late and the nest can easily be destroyed or damaged by storms. Less common nesting sites include street lights and neon signs, favoured for their warmth; and the old open-topped nests of other songbirds, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>then</b> domed over.|$|E

5|$|In lemuriform primates, the toothcomb {{may also}} play a {{secondary}} role in olfaction, which {{may account for the}} size reduction of the poorly studied upper incisors. The toothcomb may provide pressure to stimulate glandular secretions <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>then</b> spread through the fur. Furthermore, the size reduction of the upper incisors may create a gap between the teeth (interincisal diastema) that connects the philtrum (a cleft {{in the middle of the}} wet nose, or rhinarium) to the vomeronasal organ in the roof of the mouth. This would allow pheromones to be more easily transferred to the vomeronasal organ.|$|E
5|$|Most acetate esters, however, are {{produced}} from acetaldehyde using the Tishchenko reaction. In addition, ether acetates {{are used as}} solvents for nitrocellulose, acrylic lacquers, varnish removers, and wood stains. First, glycol monoethers {{are produced}} from ethylene oxide or propylene oxide with alcohol, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>then</b> esterified with acetic acid. The three major products are {{ethylene glycol monoethyl ether}} acetate (EEA), ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate (EBA), and propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate (PMA, more commonly known as PGMEA in semiconductor manufacturing processes, where it is used as a resist solvent). This application consumes about 15% to 20% of worldwide acetic acid. Ether acetates, for example EEA, {{have been shown to be}} harmful to human reproduction.|$|E
5|$|Most {{stony corals}} extend their tentacles {{to feed on}} zooplankton, but those with larger polyps take {{correspondingly}} larger prey, including various invertebrates and even small fish. In addition to capturing prey in this way, many stony corals also produce mucus films they can move over their bodies using cilia; these trap small organic particles <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>then</b> pulled towards and into the mouth. In a few stony corals, this is the primary method of feeding, and the tentacles are reduced or absent, an example being Acropora acuminata. Caribbean stony corals are generally nocturnal, with the polyps retracting into their skeletons during the day, thus maximising the exposure of the zooxanthallae to the light, but in the Indo-Pacific region, many species feed by day and night.|$|E

5|$|Nesting {{takes place}} in loose colonies, the nest a scrape found on a cliff face that is easy to take off from. A single egg is laid, being {{incubated}} by both sexes for about six weeks. Whether the egg hatches or not can be influenced by pollution and weather, although the latter has a minimal effect on whether a chick fledges or not. After a chick fledges, the parents will usually stop visiting the nest and the chick will leave. Birds of all ages feed on fish and squid, catching them by diving from the air into the water. However, the red-billed tropicbird sometimes follows surface-feeding predators. The predators will drive the prey to the surface, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>then</b> seized by the tropicbird.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses {{replicate}} within archaea: {{these are}} double-stranded DNA viruses with unusual and sometimes unique shapes. These viruses {{have been studied}} in most detail in the thermophilic archaea, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Defences against these viruses involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences within archaean genomes {{that are related to}} the genes of the viruses. Most archaea have CRISPR–Cas systems as an adaptive defence against viruses. These enable archaea to retain sections of viral DNA, <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>then</b> used to target and eliminate subsequent infections by the virus using a process similar to RNA interference.|$|E
5|$|The Salk vaccine, or inactivated {{poliovirus}} vaccine (IPV), {{is based}} on three wild, virulent reference strains, Mahoney (type 1 poliovirus), MEF-1 (type 2 poliovirus), and Saukett (type 3 poliovirus), grown in a type of monkey kidney tissue culture (Vero cell line), <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>then</b> inactivated with formalin. The injected Salk vaccine confers IgG-mediated immunity in the bloodstream, which prevents polio infection from progressing to viremia and protects the motor neurons, thus eliminating the risk of bulbar polio and post-polio syndrome.|$|E
