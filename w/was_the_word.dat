25|$|Whilst {{discussing}} the organic nature of Kikutake's theoretical Marine City project, Kawazoe used the Japanese word shinchintaisha as being {{symbolic of the}} essential exchange of materials and energy between organisms and the exterior world (literally metabolism in a biological sense.) The Japanese {{meaning of the word}} has a feeling of replacement of the old with the new and the group further interpreted this to be equivalent to the continuous renewal and organic growth of the city. As the conference was to be a world conference, Kawazoe felt that they should use a more universal word and Kikutake looked up the definition of shinchintaisha in his Japanese-English dictionary. The translation he found <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> Metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Adherents of the {{movement}} formed prayer groups called covenant communities. In these communities, members practiced a stronger commitment to spiritual ideals and created documents, or covenants, that set up rules of life. One of the first structured covenant communities <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> of God Community. It affiliated with the International Communications Office in the 1980s, and its continued growth resulted in a larger overall community called The Sword of the Spirit. The original Word of God Community eventually split from The Sword of the Spirit, however. Of the two original founders of the communities, one stayed with the Word of God and founded an international ministry that reached Eastern Europe and Africa, while the other remained president of the Sword of the Spirit, which as of 2007, had 47 member communities and 16 affiliated communities around the world.|$|E

500|$|Sheep {{meat and}} milk {{were one of}} the {{earliest}} staple proteins consumed by human civilization after the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture. [...] Sheep meat prepared for food is known as either mutton or lamb. [...] "Mutton" [...] is derived from the Old French moton, which <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> for sheep used by the Anglo-Norman rulers of much of the British Isles in the Middle Ages. This became the name for sheep meat in English, while the Old English word sceap was kept for the live animal.

500|$|The name [...] "Malaysia" [...] is a {{combination}} of the word [...] "Malay" [...] and the Latin-Greek suffix [...] "-sia"/-σία.

[...] "Malayadvipa" [...] <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> used by ancient Indian traders when referring to the Malay Peninsula.

500|$|Light in August has 21 chapters, as {{does the}} Gospel of St. John. As Virginia V. James Hlavsa points out, each chapter in Faulkner {{corresponds}} to themes in John. For example, echoing John's famous, [...] "In the beginning <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Word,</b> and the Word was with God", is Lena's insistent faith in the [...] "word" [...] of Lucas, who is, after all, the father. John 5, the healing of the lame man by immersion, is echoed by Christmas's repeatedly being immersed in liquids. The teaching in the temple in John 7 is echoed by McEachern's attempts to teach Christmas his catechism. The crucifixion occurs in John 19, the same chapter in which Christmas is slain and castrated. However, the Christian references are dark and disturbingLena is obviously not a virgin, Christmas is an enraged murdererand may be more appropriately viewed as pagan idols mistakenly worshipped as saints.|$|E

[...] Chimes did not take to Strummer at first: [...] "He was like twenty-two or twenty-three or something that seemed 'old' to me then. And he had these retro clothes and this croaky voice". Simonon came up with the band's name after they had briefly dubbed themselves the Weak Heartdrops and the Psychotic Negatives.
