5|$|After his death, Gaudí's works {{suffered}} {{a period of}} neglect and were largely unpopular among international critics, who regarded them as baroque and excessively imaginative. In his homeland he <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> disdained by Noucentisme, the new movement which took the place of Modernisme. In 1936, during the Spanish Civil War, Gaudí's workshop in the Sagrada Família was ransacked, and {{a great number of}} his documents, plans and scale models were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Although the originators {{intended}} {{to devise a}} system that <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> accessible to all, it proved necessary to use prototype units {{in the custody of}} national or local authorities as standards. Control of the prototype units of measure was maintained by the later French governments until 1875, when it was passed to an international intergovernmental organisation, the General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM).|$|E
5|$|Holmes was a {{hard working}} midfielder who possessed skill and could make neat passes, {{although}} he had been criticised for lacking in physical strength and tackling. He preferred to play as a central midfielder, although was able {{to play on the}} left side of midfield and <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> comfortable playing with either foot.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ninth}} century Orcadian control {{stretched}} into Moray, {{which was a}} semi-independent kingdom {{for much of this}} early period. The Moray rulers MacBeth (1040–1057) and his successor Lulach (1057–1058) became rulers of the entire Scottish kingdom for a time. However, Moray was subjugated by the Scottish kings after 1130, when the native ruler, Óengus of Moray was killed leading a rebellion. Another revolt in 1187 <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{intervention}} in Russia in 1918–19. He was indignant with Soviet accounts {{of a vast}} capitalist conspiracy against the world's first worker's state, some of which do not even mention the First World War; he <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> indignant with the decision to intervene as costly and harmful. He argues that the interventions, by arousing Russian nationalism, may have ensured {{the survival of the}} Bolshevik state.|$|E
5|$|The First World War saw no decisive engagements between battlefleets {{to compare}} with Tsushima. The role of battleships was {{marginal}} to the land fighting in France and Russia; it <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> marginal to the German war on commerce (Handelskrieg) and the Allied blockade.|$|E

40|$|Heterogeneity in the {{underlying}} population places {{difficulties in the}} way of interpretation of all statistical data based on averages.

Averages can be applied to individual cases only at great risk. This gross aspect of heterogeneity is not the subject of the present chapter...|$|R
40|$|There are {{at least}} two views on what relativism is. One is a view that relativism is a {{position}} that claims any positions <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> wrong or equally false as well as equally right or <b>equally</b> true. Another <b>is</b> a view that relativism is not the position that claims any positions <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> wrong or equally false but a position that claims any positions <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> right or equally true. This paper critically examines the two views and concludes the latter is a more proper concept of relativism according to critical rationalism, and the position that claims any positions <b>are</b> <b>equally</b> wrong or <b>equally</b> false <b>is</b> not relativism but relativizationism, which is compatible with criticism in Popper’s sense...|$|R
5|$|The opera was {{composed}} under severe pressure of time; the composer later {{said that the}} effort of creating it almost killed him. The initial performance, produced with lavish and innovative special effects, was highly praised, and the work <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> well received in Venice when it was revived under the composer's direction in 1640 as the inaugural work for the Teatro San Moisè.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the fortune}} {{as well as}} the {{constitution}} of Mr. Smart required the utmost care, he <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> negligent in the management of both, and his various and repeated embarrassments acting upon an imagination uncommonly fervid, produced temporary alienations of mind; which at last were attended with paroxysms so violent and continued as to render confinement necessary.|$|E

5|$|Ecclesiastical {{jurisdiction}} over the inhabitants <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> chaotic; it was first placed under the Diocese of Tlaxcala but {{was transferred to the}} Diocese of Guatemala in 1536. The Dominican Order was active in Soconusco {{during the early years of}} colonial rule, but withdrew in 1545 due to the low levels of indigenous population and the unhealthy climate. In 1545 it became a part of the Diocese of Chiapa. It was returned to Guatemala in 1561, and back to Chiapa in 1596.|$|E
5|$|Fischer won the 1962 Stockholm Interzonal by a 2½-point margin, going undefeated, with 17½/22 (+13−0=9). He was {{the first}} non-Soviet player to win an Interzonal since FIDE instituted the tournament in 1948. Russian {{grandmaster}} Alexander Kotov said of Fischer:I have discussed Fischer's play with Max Euwe and Gideon Stahlberg. All of us, experienced 'tournament old-timers', were surprised by Fischer's endgame expertise. When a young player is good at attacking or at combinations, this is understandable, but a faultless endgame technique {{at the age of}} 19 is something rare. I can recall only one other player who at that age <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> skillful at endgames — Vasily Smyslov.|$|E
5|$|However, Markham {{had second}} thoughts, {{and was soon}} writing to the current RGS president, Leonard Darwin, to express disbelief about Shackleton's claimed latitudes, repeating these doubts to Scott. Historians have surmised that Scott was Markham's protégé, and {{that the old man}} resented polar glory going to someone else. Whatever his reason, Markham adopted a {{bitterness}} towards Shackleton which he retained {{for the rest of his}} life. He is said to have crossed out all favourable references to Shackleton in his own notes on the Discovery expedition, and to have virtually ignored Shackleton's achievements in a 1912 address to the British Association. He <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> dismissive in his history of Antarctic exploration, The Lands of Silence (published posthumously in 1921).|$|E

5|$|Murphy {{developed}} his eponymous anastomotic button for a sutureless anastomosis of the gallbladder to the duodenum (his preferred treatment for acute cholecystitis), but it <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> suitable for intestinal anastomoses. He developed {{it in the}} experimental animal laboratory in a barn behind his house and first used it {{less than a week}} after developing it on a dog. The Murphy button can be credited as the forerunner of the modern end-to-end stapling instrument after having become the method of choice for operations at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere in the United States for over twenty years.|$|E
5|$|Paleontologists {{have long}} {{classified}} Alioramus within the superfamily Tyrannosauroidea, but because its remains were {{for many years}} poorly known, a more precise classification had remained elusive until the discovery of A. altai. A cladistic analysis published in 2003 found Alioramus could be further classified into the family Tyrannosauridae and the subfamily Tyrannosaurinae, alongside Tyrannosaurus, Tarbosaurus and Daspletosaurus. A 2004 study supported this result but suggested it <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> probable that Alioramus belonged outside the family Tyrannosauridae entirely, with its supposed juvenile characters actually reflecting a more basal position within Tyrannosauroidea. Another study omitted Alioramus altogether due to the only specimen's fragmentary nature. The discovery of A. altai in 2009 confirmed {{the placement of the}} genus within the Tyrannosaurinae.|$|E

Seven minutes Liverpool equalised when Steve Heighway scored this levelled the match and gave Liverpool a 2–1 lead on aggregate. Tottenham went 2–1 up when Peters scored again, this levelled the aggregate score at 2–2, but Liverpool had scored an away goal, and would therefore progress to the next round as a result.|$|E
5|$|The anti-torpedo bulges of the Admiral-class battlecruisers {{were the}} first fitted on a British capital ship to fully {{incorporate}} the lessons learned {{from a series of}} experiments begun before World War I. They consisted of an outer air space, an inner buoyancy space and the 1.5-inch protective bulkhead. The buoyancy space was filled with sealed steel crushing tubes intended to distribute the force of an explosion over as wide an area as possible as well as absorb as much of its force as possible. However, tests conducted after Hood was completed showed that filling the buoyancy space with water <b>was</b> <b>equally</b> as effective and considerably cheaper.|$|E
