50|$|In philosophy, {{ideas are}} usually {{construed}} as mental representational images of some object. Ideas {{can also be}} abstract concepts that do not present as mental images. Many philosophers have considered ideas to be a fundamental ontological category of being. The capacity to create and {{understand the meaning of}} ideas is considered to be an essential and defining feature of human beings. In a popular sense, an idea arises in a reflexive, spontaneous manner, even without thinking or serious reflection, for example, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> idea of a person or a place. A new or original idea can often lead to innovation.|$|E
5000|$|If English is, numerically speaking, the {{language}} of 'others', then {{the center of gravity}} of {{the language}} is almost certain to shift {{in the direction of the}} 'others'. In the words of Widdowson, there is likely to be a paradigm shift from one of language distribution to one of language spread: <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> spread of English, then, it is not that the conventionally coded forms and meanings are transmitted into different environments and different surroundings, and taken up and used by different groups of people. It is not a matter of the actual language being distributed but of the virtual language being spread and in the process being variously actualized. The distribution of the actual language implies adoption and conformity. The spread of virtual language implies adaptation and nonconformity. The two processes are quite different.|$|E
5000|$|Metaphors {{are also}} part of Pica's work, as she uses figures of speech to {{describe}} things that have no name. [...] "An object that has no name—that, in a way, escapes language—by invoking something entirely unrelated. Hence, we get phrases like ‘leg of the chair’ or ‘neck of the bottle’ which attach human qualities to inanimate things. Objects have a space and a weight, a physical presence that eludes language. You can’t speak an object: you have to speak around it. Metaphors are a way of doing that. In a sense, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> world, it's always in metaphors." [...] Pica's Catachresis merges distinct and contrasting found materials, such as the leg of a table or the elbow of a pipe, to construct sculptural forms that become new tools of communication and take on identities of their own.|$|E

5000|$|The {{history of}} Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union {{reflects}} {{a period of}} change for both Russia and the world. Though the terms Soviet Russia and Soviet Union are synonymous in everyday vocabulary, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> foundations of the Soviet Union, Soviet Russia refers to the few years after the abdication of the crown of the Russian Empire by Tsar Nicholas II (in 1917), but before {{the creation of the}} Soviet Union in 1922. Early in its conception, the Soviet Union strived to achieve harmony among all peoples of all countries. The original ideology of the state was primarily based on the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. In its essence, Marx's theory stated that economic and political systems went through an inevitable evolution in form, by which the current capitalist system would be replaced by a socialist state before achieving international cooperation and peace in a [...] "Workers' Paradise," [...] creating a system directed by what Marx called [...] "Pure Communism." ...|$|E
5000|$|The problem became {{significant}} in the early development of set theory. Set membership is a formal representation {{of the relation between}} the two parts of the proposition, and there are certain philosophical problems connected with this, as Frege realised when he investigated the distinction between concept and object. Assume that [...] "Shergar is a horse" [...] analyses into what [...] "Shergar" [...] names (an [...] "Object", according to Frege), and what [...] "is a horse" [...] names (a [...] "Concept"). Objects are fundamentally different from concepts, otherwise we get the problem of the unity of the proposition. A predicate cannot function as the subject of a sentence. But what are we doing <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> concept is a horse? Aren't we using the expression [...] "the concept is a horse", and isn't that a subject expression, which refers (on Frege's account) to an Object? Yes, says Frege, and on that account the concept is a horse is not a concept at all. This is a dogma that even Frege's most faithful followers found difficult to swallow.|$|E
5000|$|The {{effect of}} {{conversions}} and the Muslim missionaries is discussed by Lal. It has been claimed by {{majority of the}} Hindu as well as Non-Hindu scholara that many converted to Islam in India because {{of the work of}} Sufis and Hindu caste system. Swami Vivekananda's in his collected works of Vivekananda's , [...] "it is Hindu caste system which will be responsible for the decline of Hinduism. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> conversion of Pandits of Kashmir, they were ruled by dogras and conversions took place because of Sufi saints. In a Nagpur monastry, Ambedkar converted 150 untouchable hindus to Buddhiam. However, K.S. Lal quotes Mohammad Habib and Prof. S.A.A. Rizvi who think that such claims are [...] "latter-day fabrications". Lal says that [...] "while it would not be safe to declare that hardly any conversions through peaceful methods were effected by the Sufi Mashaikh in India, it has also to be admitted that not many reliable references to their proselytizing activity are available in genuine hagiological works. … the Mashaikh were probably responsible only for stray and individual conversions and their contribution to the growth of Muslim population may not have been much." ...|$|E

5000|$|Mona Eltahawy, a {{columnist}} for Egypt's Al Masry Al Youm and Qatar's Al Arab, wrote in the New York Times an article titled, Racism: The Arab world's dirty secret. She was a witness to racist attacks by Arab Egyptians on blacks and stated: [...] "We are a racist people in Egypt {{and we are in}} deep denial about it. On my Facebook page, I blamed racism for my argument and an Egyptian man wrote to deny that we are racists and used as his proof a program on Egyptian Radio featuring Sudanese songs and poetry! Our silence over racism not only destroys the warmth and hospitality we are proud of as Egyptians, it has deadly consequences." [...] She believed racism was behind a police crackdown on 5,000 Sudanese refugees and the beating to death of some women and children. She added: [...] "The racism I saw on the Cairo Metro has an echo in the Arab world at large, where the suffering in Darfur goes ignored because its victims are black and because those who are creating the misery in Darfur are not Americans or Israelis and we only pay attention when America and Israel behave badly." [...] She criticized the country's attitudes: [...] "We love to cry 'Islamophobia' <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> way Muslim minorities are treated in the West and yet we never stop to consider how we treat minorities and the most vulnerable among us." [...] While noting that racist incidents are condemned in the United States, she said that in Egypt, {{as well as in the}} Arab world, there is a culture of silence toward racist incidents which reflects negatively on Arab society.|$|E

[...] It's more the emotions behind the politics, and why do people feel this way. And admitting we're all human beings." [...] —Matt Stoneon staying apolitical The episode's plot originated before the season began, when the writing team began brainstorming episode ideas. Parker and Stone noticed that an episode from the run could air the day following the election, and set their sights on producing an episode. Parker was particularly set on producing the episode after seeing the uproar over a joke from a recent Family Guy episode ("Road to Germany"), in which the character of Stewie, dressed as a Nazi, sports a McCain-Palin button. South Park had previously criticized the program with the 2006 two-parter [...] "Cartoon Wars Part I" [...] and [...] "Cartoon Wars Part II", and Parker intensely disliked the joke. Rather than focus the episode's plot as satiric commentary on modern politics, the duo instead decided to create an absurd, action-movie plot inspired by the film Ocean's Eleven. [...] "We've all heard about everything; we've talked about everything to death," [...] Parker said. [...] "And it's like, let's just {{put him in a}} diamond heist movie. They're just diamond thieves, and it's not about the politics at all anymore." [...] After coming up with a neutral plot that would not disclose who would win the election, it gradually became obvious over the season that Obama would emerge the winner.Parker felt strongly {{over the course of the}} election season that Obama would win the election, so much so that he bet money on his victory in October. Parker used a sports betting website, which he normally used to gamble on football games, to predict the outcome; the website placed the odds heavily against McCain. The team initially intended to create an alternate version in case McCain won, but found the prospect too daunting, considering their quick production schedule. In a possible scenario in which McCain was declared the winner, the duo intended to air the completed episode as is and deal with what was termed their [...] "Dewey Defeats Truman" [...] moment later. Possible outcomes included doing a drunken Mystery Science Theater 3000-esque commentary over the completed version, in which lines are poorly dubbed over the dialogue. Rather than partying in the streets, Obama supporters would be rioting, while McCain supporters would hide in the Ark to protect themselves from the riot, rather than a world in which their candidate loses. [...] "There was a really stressful fifteen minutes there where we thought 'Oh man, what if we're wrong?' We really banked on it," [...] said Stone.|$|E
