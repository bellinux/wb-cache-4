25|$|In 1919, Edinburgh Corporation {{bought their}} first Leyland charabancs, for tour services. The Corporation was {{authorised}} to purchase 30 more buses in early 1920 for £25,000. By {{the middle of}} 1920, the Corporation had around 60 Leyland buses in service or on order. Of these orders, a 33-seat 'Edinburgh type' single-decker bus body with rear door and a separate smoking compartment at the back, mounted on a 4-ton 36-40hp Model O chassis with <b>worm</b> <b>drive</b> axle, was exhibited at trade shows during the year, the Darlington Royal Show in June and the Commercial Motor Show at Kensington Olympia in October. This body type, in which the driver also had his own compartment, was already reportedly well-known and popular by 1921. One reason for the complete enclosure of the driver was to increase protection against the weather, which in Edinburgh could be considerably cold.|$|E
25|$|During {{the post-war}} period, Lionel {{produced}} a construction set, utilizing a unique component set. While competitive sets used {{nut and bolt}} fasteners, the Lionel set employed round-head aircraft rivets retained with rubber grommets, {{eliminating the need for}} tools. The structural elements were hollow beams of square cross section made from folded and quite thin sheet aluminum, as a consequence subject to destruction if stepped upon. A more substantial folded aluminum base plate was used to form the foundation of most constructions, and additional circular plates could be used to construct larger wheels or pivots. Pulleys, gussets, and splices were also included. The deluxe kits included an electric AC motor with a <b>worm</b> <b>drive</b> and reduction gearset that was powered from household power. While innovative, the lack of general purpose beam members with lots of holes limited the adaptability of the set to complex constructions. Finished assemblies also lacked the robust durability of its principal competition at the time, the Erector Set.|$|E
2500|$|Ford began {{shipping}} Fordson tractors to Ford Motor Company Limited in Britain in 1917 to meet {{an order}} from the British government for 5,000. Between the time the order was accepted and when production started, Ford overhauled the design to solve several problems. The car-type radiator was enlarged to [...] capacity to cure overheating problems. The additional weight also helped hold the front down. In early Fordsons, the <b>worm</b> <b>drive</b> was located at the top under the driver's seat. During heavy operation the heat became unbearable to the operator. The <b>worm</b> <b>drive</b> was relocated {{to solve this problem}} and also allowed larger rear wheels which improved traction. Several changes were also made to simplify manufacture. The Fordson used the Model T coil magneto system; and water and oil pumps were eliminated in favor of the simpler thermosiphon cooling and splash lubrication.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the first}} World war the company adopted a single model {{policy and the}} Forty was re-introduced with a 6.2-litre overhead-cam engine in unit with a 3-speed gearbox still using {{epicyclic}} gears and a <b>worm</b> <b>drive</b> rear axle. It was very expensive, dearer than a Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost and to maintain production a smaller car, the Twenty One joined the range in 1924. This had a 3.1-litre, six-cylinder engine, now with removable cylinder head, mated to a four-speed conventional gearbox and four-wheel brakes. It grew to the 3.3-litre Twenty Three in 1926. [...] The Forty was finally replaced by the Thirty with straight-eight 4.4-litre engine in 1928. A further series of armoured cars was made in 1927, using a six-wheeled version of the Forty chassis.|$|E
2500|$|The {{ignition}} system {{was similar to}} that of the Model T,with a flywheel-mounted low-tension magneto and trembler coils. The ignition timing was manually advanced or retarded with the spark advance lever mounted near the steering column, which rotated the timer. The cooling was by thermosiphon. (In later decades, a high-tension magneto and a water pump would be added.) The transmission was a three-speed spur gear (the three forward speeds ranged from approximately 2 to 6mph). A <b>worm</b> <b>drive</b> reduction set and a differential made up the rear. The design of the rear was patented for its ease of manufacture and service. Brakes were not provided on early Fordsons, as high-ratio worm sets generally transmitted rotation in one direction only, from the worm element to the gear element, because of the high power loss through friction. To stop the tractor, the driver depressed the clutch.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{design and}} {{assembly}} improvements, Fordsons still required {{a high level}} of maintenance. A farmer near Atlanta in 1921 listed the cost of his Fordson repairs for the year as $1,246. He recorded problems in his diary, noting difficulty starting the engine, a broken wheel, engine failure and the rear end bursting throughout January, totaling costs of $1,301 for 620 hours of work. A Colorado farmer telephoned his dealer three times a day to complain about his Fordson. The most dangerous feature would occur when a towed implement became immoveable: the stoppage of the implement would cause a reaction through the transmission that would flip the tractor over backwards, sometimes killing the driver. This condition was introduced when the <b>worm</b> <b>drive</b> was relocated below the main drive pinion, relieving the driver from the heat it generated but also causing a torque on the tractor that lightened the load on the front wheels. One Indiana farmer believed the Fordson to be so dangerous that it should have been banned by law. The Eastern Implement Dealer claimed that Fordsons killed 36 drivers in 1918. Pipp's Weekly further claimed that Fordsons had killed 136 men up to August 1922. Ford spokesmen maintained the accidents resulted from inexperienced drivers, saying any tractor could be dangerous if improperly handled. Satisfied customers praised the Fordson, saying it made farm work easier and performed ideally in orchards and truck farms. Judging from the Fordson's market share in the late teens and early 20s, the anecdotal horror stories, while extreme, must have been relative outliers (that is, the notion that [...] "all Fordsons flip over backwards and burst at the seams" [...] was an exaggeration). Nonetheless, it became imprinted in many minds and became a punch line. The [...] "Hoyt-Clagwell" [...] tractor on the 1960s TV sitcom Green Acres was a Fordson Model F. It was known to randomly 'explode' followed by {{one or both of the}} rear wheels falling off.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The double-point {{downhill}} secant method (the DPDS method) {{is proposed}} {{to solve the}} nonlinear equations to determine the curvature interference limit points for modified hourglass <b>worm</b> <b>drives.</b> Thereupon, the whole curvature interference limit line {{can be obtained by}} interpolation. Based on this, the undercutting feature of the corrected worm gear can be investigated. The DPDS method has two main merits in principle. The first is the avoidance of the computation of the Jacobi matrix of the system of nonlinear equations. The second is that the sensitivity to the guess value can be decreased evidently owing to adopt the technique of the norm reduction. The effectiveness of the DPDS method is inspected and verified by a numerical example...|$|R
