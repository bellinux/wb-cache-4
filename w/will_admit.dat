5|$|Mr. Burns is {{at first}} shocked, but after {{acknowledging}} the resemblance admits that Larry {{was the product}} of a one-night stand with the daughter of a former flame at a college reunion. At first, Mr. Burns is overjoyed to have a son and tries to shape Larry after himself. Burns takes Larry to fancy parties and tries to have him enrolled in Yale, but Larry keeps acting like an oaf and proves to be an embarrassment. Larry is put to work in Sector 7G at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant alongside Homer and the two become friends. Larry invites Homer to dinner, and at dinner, Mr. Burns becomes frustrated due to Larry's boorishness and tells him that he wishes he had no son. Homer tries to convince Larry to fake a kidnapping so that Burns <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> that he loves his son, and although Larry at first opposes the idea, he eventually agrees to do it and moves into the Simpsons' basement. Homer calls Mr. Burns and says that he can have Larry back if he admits that he loves him. Marge discovers the plan and convinces Homer and Larry to abandon their plot, but as they leave the house, they are spotted.|$|E

25|$|The most general {{conditions}} under which the quotient map <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> local cross-sections are not known, although if G is a Lie group and H a closed subgroup (and thus a Lie subgroup by Cartan's theorem), then the quotient map is a fiber bundle. One {{example of this is}} the Hopf fibration, S3→S2 which is a fiber bundle over the sphere S2 whose total space is S3. From the perspective of Lie groups, S3 can be identified with the special unitary group SU(2). The abelian subgroup of diagonal matrices is isomorphic to the circle group U(1), and the quotient SU(2)/U(1) is diffeomorphic to the sphere.|$|E

25|$|Kelpies {{are partly}} descended from Dingoes, with 34% of their genes {{coming from the}} native Australian dog. At {{the time of the}} origin of the breed, it was illegal to keep dingoes as pets, some dingo owners {{registered}} their animals as Kelpies or Kelpie crosses. Kelpies and dingoes are similar in conformation and colouring. There is no doubt that some people have deliberately mated dingoes to their Kelpies, and some opinion holds that the best dilution is 1/16–1/32, but that 1/2 and 1/4 will work. As the Dingo has been regarded as a savage sheep-killer since the first European settlement of Australia, few <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> to the practice.|$|E
25|$|Diving helmet squeeze: Helmet squeeze {{will occur}} if the gas supply hose is severed above the diver and the {{non-return}} valve at the helmet gas inlet fails {{or is not}} fitted. Severity {{will depend on the}} hydrostatic pressure difference. A very rapid descent, usually by accident, may exceed {{the rate at which the}} breathing gas supply can equalise the pressure causing a temporary squeeze. The introduction of the non-return valve and high maximum gas supply flow rates have all but eliminated both these risks. In helmets fitted with a neck dam, the dam <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> water into the helmet if the internal pressure gets too low; this is less of a problem than helmet squeeze but the diver may drown if the gas supply is not reinstated quickly. This form of barotrauma is avoidable by controlled descent rate, which is standard practice for commercial divers, who will use shotlines, diving stages and wet bells to control descent and ascent rates.|$|E

500|$|Divorce and remarriage: Officially, the AG disapproves of Christians divorcing for any cause except [...] "fornication and adultery". Where these {{circumstances}} exist or where a Christian has been divorced by an unbeliever (see Pauline privilege), the AG allows [...] "the question of remarriage {{to be resolved}} by the believer in the Light of God's Word". For Christians who were divorced and remarried before their conversion, {{it is recommended that}} local AG churches receive them as members. The General Council has offered this guideline for AG churches; however, churches are free to determine their own standards of membership with the result that many local churches <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> divorced and remarried persons as members even if the above conditions are not met (see Christian views on divorce).|$|E
500|$|The task Clinton left Cornwallis {{with was}} to, first and foremost, {{preserve}} the gains made by taking Charleston, {{and only then}} engage in offensive moves. Clinton's orders gave Cornwallis wide latitude in how to achieve the goal of pacifying both South and North Carolina, after which Clinton expected Cornwallis to move into Virginia. [...] Clinton wrote, [...] "I should wish you to assist in operations which will certainly be carried on in the Chesapeake {{as soon as we}} are relieve from our apprehension of a superior fleet and the season <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> ..." [...] However, Clinton provided Cornwallis with a relatively modest force of British, German, and provincial (Loyalist) regimentsabout 3,000 menwith which to accomplish all of this. [...] The forces he was given to accomplish this were limited by the necessity of keeping a large British force in New York under Clinton to shadow Washington. [...] Cornwallis was expected to recruit more Loyalists, who were believed to be more numerous in the southern colonies.|$|E

[...] On Ros' role in the episode, Gimmers said [...] "I don't think I'll ever be able to say I'm [...] "warming" [...] to such an ice queen as Ros, but I <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> to a growing admiration." [...] Scott Matthewman of The Stage stated [...] "the seventh series of the spy show continues apace," [...] and praised the episode for [...] "the superb performance of Hermione Norris as Ros Myers, fast becoming the twisted moral centre of the show.

500|$|Journalists {{reviewing}} the match praised Arsenal’s young team; some however {{went as far}} to criticise their conduct in the brawl. Henry Winter wrote in The Daily Telegraph of 26 February 2007 [...] "…all feline grace and youthful ambition, [...] were the better team, moving the ball around exquisitely at times," [...] while Glenn Moore of The Independent reflected [...] "the Arsenal manager can take great consolation from {{the quality of his}} young footballers." [...] The Guardian correspondent Kevin McCarra opened his match report with the line [...] "To Chelsea the trophy, to Arsenal the future," [...] and felt the latter club deserved plaudits for the role they played in the final, and competition as a whole. He commended Chelsea’s adversity and singled out Carvalho as an example; at fault for Arsenal’s goal, the defender’s performance thereafter was faultless. Matt Dickinson of The Times agreed that Arsenal had played the better football, but said their temperament was [...] "brittle" [...] – [...] " [...] had lost the trophy before they lost their heads." [...] Football pundit Alan Hansen was scathing of Arsenal’s behaviour and suggested their inexperience had a part to play: “When they reflect upon it, Arsenal <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> that they were largely in the wrong." [...] He was critical of Wenger’s team selection and felt the big clubs saw the competition, much like the FA Cup as an irrelevance. The violence and sendings off on the pitch led to some media outlets dubbing the match as the [...] "Snarling Cup Final", {{or in the case of}} Winter's match report the [...] "Carnage Cup final".|$|E
500|$|In 1936, Feller {{was signed}} by Cy Slapnicka, a scout for the Indians, for one dollar and an autographed baseball. While {{scouting}} Feller, Slapnicka said, [...] "This was a kid pitcher I had to get. I knew he was something special. His fastball was fast and fuzzy; it didn't go in a straight line; it would wiggle and shoot around. I didn't know then that he was smart and had {{the heart of a}} lion, but I knew that I was looking at an arm the likes of which you see only once in a lifetime." [...] Feller was assigned to the Fargo-Moorhead Twins and was to report there after finishing the high school semester. Slapnicka was later named general manager of the Indians and transferred Feller's contract from Fargo-Moorhead to the New Orleans Pelicans. He was planning to add Feller, along with outfielder Tommy Henrich, to the major league roster after a few exhibition and semi-pro games without visiting either farm club. By doing so, the Indians would be in violation of Major League Baseball's rule stating that, at the time, only minor league teams could sign amateur baseball players to contracts. After a three-month investigation, concluding in December 1936, about whether the Indians broke any Major League Baseball rules by signing Feller, Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis disagreed with the argument presented by Slapnicka and Indians president Alva Bradley, but awarded both Feller and Henrich free agency and required the club to pay a $7,500 fine. Landis made the decision partly due to the testimony of Feller and his father, who wanted his son to play for Cleveland and who had also told Landis he would take the issue to court. Feller elected to remain with the Indians but Henrich joined the New York Yankees. Sports columnist Joe Williams wrote, [...] "For $7500 the Cleveland Indians received $500,000 worth of publicity. ... I feel pretty sure Mr. Alva Bradley, president of the Indians, <b>will</b> <b>admit</b> this is the cheapest investment he ever made in publicity." ...|$|E
