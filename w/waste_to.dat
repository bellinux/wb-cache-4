Restrictions were immediately more stringent {{than in the}} Great War as with effect from 8 January 1940 ration books were issued and most foods were subject to ration. By August 1940, legislation was passed that made the wasting of food a prisonable offence. Posters encouraged kitchen <b>waste</b> <b>to</b> be used for feeding animals, primarily swine but also poultry.|$|E

A widespread pilot scheme for separate food waste collection, involving nineteen English local authorities, achieved success and 'high levels of satisfaction' from households.|$|E
5|$|Science fiction films often depict humans {{successfully}} repelling alien invasions, {{but scientists}} more often take {{the view that}} an extraterrestrial civilization with sufficient power to reach the Earth {{would be able to}} destroy human civilization with minimal effort. Operations that are enormous on a human scale, such as destroying all major population centers on a planet, bombarding a planet with deadly neutron radiation, or even traveling to another planetary system in order to lay <b>waste</b> <b>to</b> it, may be important tools for a hostile and totalitarian civilization.|$|E
5|$|The plasma {{membrane}} {{of a cell}} has multiple functions. These include transporting nutrients into the cell, allowing <b>waste</b> <b>to</b> leave, preventing materials from entering the cell, averting needed materials from leaving the cell, maintaining the pH of the cytosol, and preserving the osmotic pressure of the cytosol. Transport proteins which allow some materials to pass through but not others are used for these functions. These proteins use ATP hydrolysis to pump materials against their concentration gradients.|$|E

5|$|Dalmatian cities {{remained}} {{loyal to}} Mary and Sigismund, not least {{thanks to the}} couple's alliance with Venice. A notable exception was Klis, which supported the rebellious nobleman John of Palisna. Tvrtko {{took control of the}} Klis Fortress in July 1387, which enabled him to launch attacks on Split. Although the Bosnian army laid <b>waste</b> <b>to</b> the areas of Split and Zadar, the cities refused to capitulate. Their officials were willing to honour King Tvrtko but insisted that Queen Mary and King Sigismund were their legitimate sovereigns. Ostrovica Fortress submitted to Tvrtko in November, followed by Trogir.|$|E
5|$|Following the colonists' retreat, an emboldened Ferguson {{dispatched}} a paroled prisoner across {{the mountains to}} warn the colonists to cease their opposition or Ferguson would lay <b>waste</b> <b>to</b> the countryside.

Shelby and Sevier raised 240 men each, and were joined by William Campbell with 400 from Washington County, Virginia and Charles McDowell with 160 men from Burke and Rutherford counties in North Carolina. The forces mustered at Sycamore Shoals on September 25, 1780. The troops crossed the difficult terrain of the Blue Ridge Mountains and arrived at McDowell's estate near Morganton, North Carolina, on September 30, 1780.

5|$|Geoffrey married Isabella de la Roche, {{daughter}} of the Great Lord of Athens and Thebes, Guy I de la Roche. In 1256–58, he {{became involved in the}} War of the Euboeote Succession, at first as a lieutenant of his uncle, Prince William II of Villehardouin, leading an army that laid <b>waste</b> <b>to</b> Euboea and recovered the town of Negroponte for the Prince. Later, however, he sided with his father-in-law Guy de la Roche and the other Frankish lords who opposed William's hegemonic ambitions. William however prevailed in the Battle of Karydi in 1258, and a parliament was assembled at Nikli to judge the defeated lords. Geoffrey was pardoned by the Prince and his confiscated lands returned, but this time as a personal grant, rather than a fief held in right of conquest.|$|E

In Australia, Indigenous Australians {{are aware that}} termites are edible but do not consume them even in times of scarcity; there are few explanations as to why. Termite mounds are the main sources of soil consumption (geophagy) in many countries including Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa.

In general, land farming refers to the repeated application of <b>wastes</b> <b>to</b> the soil surface, whereas land spreading and land treatment are often used interchangeably to describe the one-time application of <b>wastes</b> <b>to</b> the soil surface.

5|$|Incinerating waste has {{traditionally}} been viewed as a method with the main purpose being {{the destruction of the}} waste involved. Recovering the energy generated from this process has become of greater importance, and all incineration facilities in England now operate as energy-from-waste plants (with many operating as combined heat and power facilities). Critics question the safety of the pollutants emitted during the process and argue that, as incinerators require constant levels of <b>waste</b> <b>to</b> operate, it encourages more waste. However, the levels of emissions from the incinerating process has been greatly reduced by developments in technology and legislation.|$|E
5|$|Many Muslims {{considered}} this unexpected victory a proof {{that they had}} been favored by God and believed they were assured such victories in the future. A number of the leading tribesmen of Quraysh had been killed at Badr and so leadership passed to Abu Sufyan. He forbade the mourning of the losses at Badr, for he was eager to exact revenge upon Muhammad, vowing to conduct a retaliatory raid on the city of Medina. Several months later, Abu Sufyan accompanied a party of 200 men to the city, obtaining temporary residence with the chief of the Jewish tribe Banu Nadir and learning more of the current situation in Medina. He and his party then left Medina, burning down two houses and laying <b>waste</b> <b>to</b> some fields in fulfillment of his vow. Further skirmishes between the Meccans and the Muslims would occur thereafter.|$|E

40|$|AbstractOne of the {{fundamental}} conditions of being healthy is a healthy environment. Medical wastes, {{from the moment they}} are produced to the moment they are finally removed in the waste cycle, are directly or indirectly interacted with the environment and humans. The medical wastes, which are not collected and removed in accordance with the rules, may harm the environment integrity, and become a problem affecting the environment and human health negatively. This study is a qualitative one that aims to determine the awareness of the nursing students about the damages caused by the medical <b>wastes</b> <b>to</b> the environment and humans. To do so, the nursing students were asked open-ended questions about the damages caused by the medical <b>wastes</b> <b>to</b> the environment and humans, and the given answers were evaluated to determine their views about the subject matter. In the result of the evaluation made, the nursing students considered the medical <b>wastes</b> <b>to</b> be a threat to the environment and humans, and yet, few of them stated that the medical wastes did not pose an important threat to the environment and humans...|$|R

That time Louis had been sympathetic to Henry's cause, but decided in favour of maintaining the provisions. At Amiens Henry argued that his right to appoint his own ministers and officials had been denied him, in violation of the royal prerogative. He also accused his opponents of destroying royal castles and laying <b>waste</b> <b>to</b> royal lands. For his injuries he demanded a compensation of the barons of £300,000 and 200,000 marks. Referring to the papal writ of annulment, Henry asked the French king to free him from observing the provisions forced upon him by the barons.|$|E

Following the battle, Elrond realizes that the Elves and Dwarves must join forces to purge the threat of Sauron's forces in the North. The next battle {{takes place in the}} Goblin capital of Ettenmoors, where the Goblin fortress is destroyed, and Gorkil the Goblin King is killed. After their victory, the heroes are informed that the Goblins, on Sauron's command, enlisted the service of a Dragon named Drogoth who is laying <b>waste</b> <b>to</b> the Dwarves of the Blue Mountains.

There, Kain and Cecil watch in horror as monsters burst forth from inside the ring and lay <b>waste</b> <b>to</b> the village. A young girl, Rydia, is the only survivor and summons a monster named Titan in anger. This monster causes an earthquake, separating Cecil and Kain.
