Besides, hospital wastewater has the same quality as municipal wastewater, but may also potentially contain various hazardous components. In this paper, physical and chemical specifications of produced wastewater in hospitals of Iran were investigated experiments. Results were compared with the effluent parameters of wastewater standards of Iranian Department of the Environment. 70 governmental hospitals from different provinces of Iran were selected by purposive (non-random) sampling method. For data analysis, SPSS and EXCEL softwares were applied. The findings of the study showed that 52 % of the surveyed hospitals were not equipped and 48 % were equipped with <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>systems.</b> The mean of Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Chemical Oxygen Demand and Total Suspended Solids of the effluent of <b>wastewater</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>systems</b> were reported as 113, 188 and 99 mg/L respectively.
