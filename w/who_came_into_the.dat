He was chosen in a preliminary 24-man squad to tour India and Pakistan in 1948–49, but did not make the final selection of 16 players, and was overlooked for the 1950 tour of England. He continued to play irregularly for Trinidad in the following years, but played no further representative cricket until 1957.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} Virginia Tech's kickoff, the California offense {{returned to}} the field. The Bears were unable to repeat {{the success of their}} first drive and went three and out, punting the ball back to Virginia Tech. The Hokies recovered the ball at their 43-yard line and moved quickly. Bryan Randall completed a 53-yard pass to receiver Chris Shreve. Two plays later, Randall completed a three-yard touchdown pass that gave the Hokies a 14–7 lead with 2:40 remaining in the quarter. California received the ball after the touchdown, but again went three and out. As before, the Hokies struck quickly. After starting from the California 49-yard line, it took one play for Virginia Tech to score. Randall completed a long pass to quarterback Marcus Vick, <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game as a wide receiver. The score and extra point made the game 21–7 with 50seconds left in the quarter. California received the kickoff and ran three quick plays {{before the end of the}} quarter. As time expired, California faced a fourth down and nine yards from their 36-yard line and was preparing to punt. With one quarter elapsed, Virginia Tech led, 21–7.|$|E
5|$|Reeves' {{impact was}} immediate. As Parcells {{had done in}} 1984, Reeves named Simms his {{starting}} quarterback. The defense returned to form, and allowed more than 20 points once all season. With two regular season games left, the Giants were 11–3 and appeared poised for a first-round playoff bye. They were upset by a Phoenix Cardinals team, <b>who</b> <b>came</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> game with just five wins, 17–6, in the next-to-last week of the season, setting up a winner–take–all contest against Dallas in the final regular season game. Though the Giants played well, it was Emmitt Smith's memorable performance with a separated shoulder that led the Cowboys to a 16–13 overtime win, giving the Cowboys a sweep of the season series and home-field advantage throughout the NFC Playoffs. Despite the loss, the Giants made the playoffs as a Wild Card and won their first-round game, 17–10 over the Vikings. However, they were defeated by the San Francisco 49ers 44–3 in the divisional playoffs. Simms played in all 16 games, completing nearly 62% of his passes, and threw for over 3,000 yards and 15 touchdowns. Simms, Hampton, offensive linemen Jumbo Elliot and center Bart Oates made the Pro Bowl, and Reeves was named Coach of the Year by the Associated Press. After the season, Lawrence Taylor and Phil Simms, the two biggest figures of the late 1980s and early 1990s Giants teams, retired.|$|E
