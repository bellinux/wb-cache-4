40|$|Shear {{walls are}} primary {{structural}} systems that support building against lateral loads (tornadoes and hurricanes). Even though concrete shear walls {{are the most}} efficient lateral resisting system, they are rarely used in a residential construction. The reasons for why contractors do not use concrete walls in residential construction were due to higher construction cost and slower construction paces. This study proposes building and testing residential concrete structural wall system that is energy efficient, cost competitive and structurally safe. In order to decrease environmental impact of the residential construction process, this study proposed implementing sustainability concept while building residential structures. The recycled material {{was used in the}} wall’s concrete mix, while salvaged material was used for the <b>wall’s</b> <b>formwork.</b> To test how experimental concrete mix behaves under high lateral loads, two reinforced concrete shear walls with typical residential profiles were built and evaluated. Shear wall with experimental mix (SW 2) showed significantly lower shear capacity (27. 7 kips) compared to the shear capacity (40. 5 kips) of the wall with control mix (SW 1). However, the obtained shear capacity for both walls was greater than shear demand (21. 1 kips). The results showed that implementing sustainability concept in residential construction process did not affect its cost competitiveness. The proposed system was shown to be environmentally friendly and structurally safe, despite excessive compressive strength retardation of experimental concrete mix caused by mineral or chemical contamination...|$|R

The procedures assume two-dimensional frame models, which employ both the analysis computer program (CPF) and the maturity-based model. The interaction of structure and compressible shoring, time-dependent concrete properties of strength, creep and shrinkage of concrete and the change in construction load during construction cycles are considered in the shoring system analysis. For <b>wall</b> <b>formwork</b> analysis, the time-dependent concrete properties of strength and the properties of wall-element parts are considered.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{accurately}} predict the varying of formwork pressure over time, {{it is necessary}} to consider various factors influencing the development of formwork pressure. A prediction model has been previously proposed, but that model has some limitations in that only intrinsic material characteristics are taken into account. Extrinsic effects such as <b>wall</b> friction, <b>formwork</b> flexibility, and external temperature are excluded in the model. This study focuses on the wall friction effect as one of the extrinsic factors. First, by incorporating the intrinsic model and friction stress acting on the interface, a method of calculating formwork pressure considering the wall friction effect is suggested. To find out how much friction stress is acting on the interface and how it varies over time, formwork pressure tests were performed with circular column formworks having three different diameters. In these columns, the vertical pressure at the bottom and the lateral pressures were measured. To calibrate parameters of the intrinsic model for the same material as that used in the formwork pressure tests, additional tests were conducted with a specially designed apparatus that can exclude effects of extrinsic factors. From tests and analysis results, it was found that wall friction greatly affects the variation of formwork pressure over time. The newly suggested calculation method can give a good prediction of real formwork pressure. close 5...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{behavior}} of the particular building system that makes use of load-bearing walls of reinforced concrete cast into mineralized wood. This construction system has been studied under the action of pseudo-static forces (experimentally and numerically) and under dynamic forces (only numerically). The activities carried out, in general, employed experimental equipment for the realization of tests on materials and on specimens that can be both portions and real scale walls. Additionally, a commercial software has been used for the numerical modeling of the elements composing the construction system in object. In particular, in the first chapters of the thesis, a complete analytical treatment based on experimental results obtained in the years before the Ph. D beginning and during the Ph. D is provided. The original aspects, from the experimental point of view, were the two experimental campaigns concerning portions of panel subjected to direct shear and real scale walls subjected to cyclic horizontal forces in a pseudo-static fashion. In addition, the experimental campaign was completed with the tests on wall-to-wall and wall-to-floor connections required by LL. GG. Min. of Public Works (2011) and aimed at the study of load-bearing <b>walls</b> cast within <b>formwork</b> blocks. The direct shear tests have shown an incongruity of the experimental results with the first analytical treatment developed in the years before 2012 and therefore it was necessary to revise it with new theoretical considerations. A new and original analytical treatment based on strut-and-tie mechanisms was developed. In the last chapters, the construction system has been treated numerically. In the numerical modeling of the structural system the analytical treatment exposed in the first chapters was employed using elements with lumped and distributed plasticity able to simulate the main failure mechanisms documented in the experimental tests. This modeling was first validated on the results of tests on full-scale walls and then used to simulate the behavior of multi-story buildings, regular and irregular, with bi-dimensional and spatial models. These buildings have been subjected to static and dynamic forces typical of seismic action. The numerical results of the simulations coupled with the capacity curves enabled the estimate of the seismic response of the building system and, finally, the behavior factor which best synthesizes it. The estimate of this parameter is of fundamental importance in seismic design, {{it is one of the}} main research results. It is worth to notice that the Italian Guidelines prescriptions regarding the behavior factor are more conservative with respect to the results of this researc...|$|R
40|$|The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Pittsburgh Research Laboratory, {{cooperated with}} Tecrete Industries Pty. Ltd. and BHP Australia Coal in a {{research}} program to evaluate the strength characteristics and air leakage of four seal and two stopping designs for use in underground coal mines. A fundamental safety research area for NIOSH is to eliminate the occurrence of coal mine explosions or to mitigate their effects. One approach {{to achieve this goal}} is to develop new and innovative seal designs that provide increased explosion isolation protection for the mining personnel against ignitions that originate from within the gob or other worked-out areas of the mine. Full-scale seals and stoppings were constructed in the Experimental Mine at Lake Lynn Laboratory near Fairchance, Fayette County, PA. They were air-leakage tested, then subjected to a series of explosions with average pressure pulses ranging from 25 to 500 kPa (3. 5 to 72 psi). Instrumentation measured seal displacement and acceleration as a function of time, providing data to assist in the development of numerical models for future seal design. All three seals designed with Meshblock wire formwork and a monolithic shotcrete core withstood the first explosion test, which generated an average maximum pressure of - 140 kPa (- 20 psi) while maintaining acceptable air leakage rates. These seals ranged from 175 to 325 mm thick. They included a 2. 7 -m-high by 325 -mm-thick seal that was tested 27 hr after completion against this - 140 -kPa explosion pressure, a special requirement of the test program. This seal survived explosions with pressure pulses up to 300 kPa (43 psi). The 2. 3 -m-high by 325 -mm-thick Meshblock seal survived three explosion tests with overpressures up to 455 kPa (66 psi) and satisfied the air leakage criteria. A 1, 200 -mm-thick plug seal was constructed of two Gunmesh <b>formwork</b> <b>walls</b> in-filled with shotcrete and a 3, 450 -kPa (500 -psi) strength Aquablend core. This plug seal survived three explosions with pressure pulses ranging from 150 to 430 kPa (- 22 to 62. 5 psi) with no measurable post explosion air leakage. Two Gunmesh stoppings with thicknesses of 40 and 75 mm withstood explosion overpressures of 23 and 115 kPa, respectively. Anchoring all seal and stopping designs into the roof, ribs, and floor with steel "roofbolts" provided very effective boundary constraint that is critical to the performance of structures subject to explosion overpressures.
