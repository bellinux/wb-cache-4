40|$|Path {{and manner}} are {{important}} organizing dimensions of verb lexicons. We investigated how priming with path verbs, manner verbs, or no priming might influence event processing. Before watching a videotaped target event, subjects were primed by path and manner verbs accompanying other, unrelated events. We found effects of priming verbs on the verbs subjects produced to describe an unlabeled event. We found effects of verb produced on subsequent recognition. We compare these <b>effects</b> <b>from</b> selfgenerated verbs <b>with</b> <b>effects</b> <b>from</b> experimenter-produced verbs...|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the appeals}} process, the case was heard by the Supreme Court of India; the court ruled in Jindal's favour, asking the Government of India to {{consider}} the matter. The Union Cabinet of India then amended the Indian Flag Code <b>with</b> <b>effect</b> <b>from</b> 26 January 2002, allowing private citizens to hoist the flag on any day of the year, subject to their safeguarding the dignity, honour and respect of the flag. It is also held that the code was not a statute and restrictions under the code ought to be followed; also, the right to fly the flag is a qualified right, unlike the absolute rights guaranteed to citizens, and should be interpreted in the context of Article 19 of the Constitution of India.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{insufficient}} clearance {{between the}} locomotives and the 25kV overhead electric wires south of Crewe, {{the whole class}} was banned from operating under them <b>with</b> <b>effect</b> <b>from</b> 1 September 1964.

5|$|In 1798, {{members of}} the Protestant Dissenter {{tradition}} (mainly Presbyterian) made common cause with Roman Catholics in a republican rebellion inspired and led by the Society of United Irishmen, {{with the aim of}} creating an independent Ireland. Despite assistance from France the rebellion was put down by British and Irish government and yeomanry forces. In 1800, the British and Irish parliaments both passed Acts of Union that, <b>with</b> <b>effect</b> <b>from</b> 1 January 1801, merged the Kingdom of Ireland and the Kingdom of Great Britain to create a United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.|$|E
5|$|In July 1943, Benn {{enlisted in}} the Royal Air Force as an aircraftman 2nd Class. His father and elder brother Michael (who was later killed in an accident) were already serving in the RAF.

5|$|Ministers may be {{designated}} by the Prime Minister {{to be in charge}} of particular ministries, or as Ministers in the Prime Minister's Office. Such Ministers were formerly known as Ministers without portfolio. The Prime Minister may retain any department or subject in his charge. Some Ministers are appointed as Second Ministers for portfolios other than their own to assist the primary Minister in his or her duties. For instance, <b>with</b> <b>effect</b> <b>from</b> 1 April 2009 during the 11th Parliament, Lim Hwee Hua, who was a Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, also held the posts of Second Minister for Finance and Second Minister for Transport.|$|E

5|$|The first NCMP {{to take up}} a seat in Parliament, Dr. Lee Siew-Choh of the WP, did so {{following}} the 1988 general election at which Chiam See Tong was the only opposition MP elected. The WP's Lee and Francis Seow were declared elected as NCMPs on 16 December 1988. However, on 9 January 1989 the Speaker of Parliament Tan Soo Khoon announced that Seow had lost his seat <b>with</b> <b>effect</b> <b>from</b> 17 December 1988 under Article 45 of the Constitution after he was convicted and fined for tax evasion. In the general election that followed in 1991, no NCMP seats were offered because four opposition members were successful in their respective electoral divisions, and thus the number of opposition MPs exceeded the three allotted NCMP seats.|$|E
5|$|Two {{conflicting}} views {{exist as}} to whether the war was a civil or an international war. The prevailing view in Serbia is that there were two civil wars in the area: one between Croats and Serbs living in Croatia, and another between SFR Yugoslavia and Croatia, a part of the federation. The prevailing view in Croatia and of most international law experts, including both international courts ICTY and ICJ, is that the war was an international conflict, a war of aggression waged by the rump Yugoslavia and Serbia against Croatia, supported by Serbs in Croatia.The armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia started shortly after the date on which Slovenia and Croatia declared their independence on June 25, 1991 between the military forces of the SFRY and Slovenia and Croatia. Such armed conflict should of course be characterized as internal because the declarations of independence were suspended in consequence of the proposal of the EC for three months. After the expiration of the three months' period, on October 7, 1991, Slovenia proclaimed its independence <b>with</b> <b>effect</b> <b>from</b> that date, and Croatia <b>with</b> <b>effect</b> <b>from</b> October 8, 1991. So the armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia should be considered international as from October 8, 1991 because the independence of these two States was definite on that date}} Neither Croatia nor Yugoslavia ever formally declared war on each other. Unlike the Serbian position that the conflict need not be declared as it was a civil war, the Croatian motivation for not declaring war was that Tuđman believed that Croatia could not confront the JNA directly and did everything to avoid an all-out war.|$|E
5|$|<b>With</b> <b>effect</b> <b>from</b> 6 April 1952, {{when the}} Union of South Africa instituted its own range of {{military}} decorations and medals, these new awards took precedence before all earlier British decorations and medals awarded to South Africans, {{with the exception}} of the Victoria Cross, which still took precedence before all other awards. The other older British awards continued to be worn in the order prescribed by the British Central Chancery of the Orders of Knighthood.|$|E
40|$|A simple {{model is}} {{constructed}} which allows to compute modified dispersion relations <b>with</b> <b>effects</b> <b>from</b> loop quantum gravity. Different quantization choices {{can be realized}} and their effects {{on the order of}} corrections studied explicitly. A comparison with more involved semiclassical techniques shows that there is agreement even at a quantitative level. Furthermore, by contrasting Hamiltonian and Lagrangian descriptions we show that possible Lorentz symmetry violations may be blurred as an artifact of the approximation scheme. Whether this is the case in a purely Hamiltonian analysis can be resolved by an improvement in the effective semiclassical analysis. Comment: 16 pages, RevTeX...|$|R
50|$|Another {{trend was}} for very large apocalyptic history paintings, often {{combining}} extreme natural events, or divine wrath, with human disaster, attempting to outdo The Raft of the Medusa, and now often drawing comparisons <b>with</b> <b>effects</b> <b>from</b> Hollywood. The leading English {{artist in the}} style was John Martin, whose tiny figures were dwarfed by enormous earthquakes and storms, and {{worked his way through}} the biblical disasters, and those to come in the final days. Other works such as Delacroixs Death of Sardanapalus included larger figures, and these often drew heavily on earlier artists, especially Poussin and Rubens, with extra emotionalism and special effects.|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} process e^+e^-→ tc̅+ct̅ in a R_p violating supersymmetric model <b>with</b> <b>effects</b> <b>from</b> both B- and L-violating interactions. The {{calculation}} {{shows that it}} is possible to either detect the R_p violating signal at the Next Linear Collider or get more stringent constraints on the heavy-flavor /R_p couplings. A comparision with results from γγ→ tc̅+ ct̅ may allow to distinguish between B- and L-violating interactions. For very clean background conditions and /R_p violation parameters close to present limits, a future detection of B-violating interactions should be possible. The process of μ ^+μ ^-→ t c̅+ct̅ is also considered...|$|R
