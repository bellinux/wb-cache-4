500|$|Although Brühl {{thought the}} film [...] "very realistic", he was {{dissatisfied}} with his character's authenticity. The actor felt [...] "attached" [...] to Jan, admiring his [...] "courage {{to want to}} change the <b>way</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going,</b> to act to defend his beliefs", but thought it was [...] "very utopian and naive, that they take so much risk to break into some rich man's house to move things around." ...|$|E

I am Jesus Christ. I'm back again." [...] The meeting was adjourned for lunch and Lennon never mentioned the subject again. In May 1969, Lennon and McCartney recorded [...] "The Ballad of John and Yoko", with Lennon singing the lines, [...] "Christ, you know it ain't easy, You know how hard it can be, The <b>way</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going,</b> They're gonna crucify me." [...] In a BBC interview a few months later, Lennon called himself [...] "One of Christ's biggest fans", talked about the Church of England, his vision of heaven, and unhappiness over being unable to marry Yoko Ono in church.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 February the {{original}} English version treaty and its translation into Māori were put before {{a gathering of}} northern chiefs inside a large marquee on the lawn in front of Busby's house at Waitangi. Hobson read the treaty aloud in English and Williams read his Māori version. Māori chiefs (rangatira) then debated the treaty for five hours, much of which was recorded and translated by the Paihia missionary station printer, William Colenso. Rewa, a Catholic chief, who had {{been influenced by the}} French Catholic Bishop Pompallier, said [...] "The Māori people don't want a governor! We aren't European. It's true that we've sold some of our lands. But this country is still ours! We chiefs govern this land of our ancestors". Moka 'Kainga-mataa' argued that all land unjustly purchased by Europeans should be returned. Whai asked: [...] "Yesterday I was cursed by a white man. Is that the <b>way</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to be?". Protestant Chiefs such as Hōne Heke, Pumuka, Te Wharerahi, Tamati Waka Nene and his brother Eruera Maihi Patuone were accepting of the Governor. Hōne Heke said: ...|$|E

I tell you frankly, we keep our eye on Japan, and we build a good many commercial ships which would astonish you if you examined them thoroughly. Our National Guard, too, know a bit more about soldiering than their grandfathers. You people, on the other hand, seem to have become infatuated pacifists.

50|$|Reuvens {{tried to}} {{evaluate}} the worth of the collection by comparing it to other large recently sold collections. Though the statues of the Anasty collection were not very impressive, there were some mummies and especially {{the large amount of}} papyri made the collection worth having. The Dutch opening bids of 50.000 guilders and then 70.000 were angrily rejected, and a representative was sent to the Netherlands to speak with Reuvens. It was clear that the negotiations were beyond Humbert at this point. Humbert was not happy with the <b>way</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going,</b> and thought Reuvens' taxation was much too low. Reuvens had meanwhile upgraded his estimation of the value.|$|R
6000|$|... 104. I have {{directed}} {{your attention}} early to foliage for two reasons. First, {{that it is}} always accessible as a study; and secondly, that its modes of growth present simple examples {{of the importance of}} leading or governing lines. It is by seizing these leading lines, when we cannot seize all, that likeness and expression are given to a portrait, and grace and a kind of vital truth to the rendering of every natural form. I call it vital truth, because these chief lines are always expressive of the past history and present action of the thing. They show in a mountain, first, how it was built or heaped up; and secondly, how it is now being worn away, and from what quarter the wildest storms strike it. In a tree, they show what kind of fortune it has had to endure from its childhood: how troublesome trees have come in its way, and pushed it aside, and tried to strangle or starve it; where and when kind trees have sheltered it, and grown up lovingly together with it, bending as it bent; what winds torment it most; what boughs of it behave best, and bear most fruit; and so on. In a wave or cloud, these leading lines show the run of the tide and of the wind, and the sort of change which the water or vapor is at any moment enduring in its form, as it meets shore, or counter-wave, or melting sunshine. Now remember, nothing distinguishes great men from inferior men more than their always, whether in life or in art, knowing the <b>way</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going.</b> Your dunce thinks they are standing still, and draws them all fixed; your wise man sees the change or changing in them, and draws them so,--the animal in its motion, the tree in its growth, the cloud in its course, the mountain in its wearing away. Try always, whenever you look at a form, to see the lines in it which have had power over its past fate and will have power over its futurity. Those are its awful lines; see that you seize on those, whatever else you miss. Thus, the leafage in Fig. 16 (p. 63) grew round the root of a stone pine, on the brow of a crag at Sestri near Genoa, and all the sprays of it are thrust away in their first budding by the great rude root, and spring out in every direction round it, as water splashes when a heavy stone is thrown into it. Then, when they have got clear of the root, they begin to bend up again; some of them, being little stone pines themselves, have a great notion of growing upright, if they can; and this struggle of theirs to recover their straight road towards the sky, after being obliged to grow sideways in their early years, is the effort that will mainly influence their future destiny, and determine {{if they are to be}} crabbed, forky pines, striking from that rock of Sestri, whose clefts nourish them, with bared red lightning of angry arms towards the sea; or if they are to be goodly and solemn pines, with trunks like pillars of temples, and the purple burning of their branches sheathed in deep globes of cloudy green. Those, then, are their fateful lines; see that you give that spring and resilience, whatever you leave ungiven: depend upon it, their chief beauty is in these.|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, after {{returning}} from the tour of England documented in the film Dont Look Back, Dylan was unhappy with the public's expectations of him, {{as well as the}} direction his career was taking, and seriously considered quitting the music business. In a 1966 Playboy interview, he described his dissatisfaction: [...] "Last spring, I guess I <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to quit singing. I was very drained, and the <b>way</b> <b>things</b> <b>were</b> <b>going,</b> it <b>was</b> a very draggy situation... But 'Like a Rolling Stone' changed it all.

5000|$|As {{the folk}} music craze died out, Bonniwell sought to create music with [...] "fuzz and fangs." [...] In 1965, he formed a trio called The Ragamuffins, which quickly grew into The Music Machine. Adopting Beatles-style moptop hair and all-black outfits (and Bonniwell's {{signature}} single black leather glove), Music Machine churned out a diversified style of garage rock. After the band debut's album spawned the successful single [...] "Talk Talk" [...] (1966), the original line-up broke apart. Bonniwell continued on with Music Machine, now signed to Warner Bros. Records and renamed The Bonniwell Music Machine (1967).

50|$|In his Nicomachean Ethics, (1095a15 - 22) Aristotle {{says that}} eudaimonia means 'doing and living well'. It is {{significant}} that synonyms for eudaimonia are living well and doing well. On the standard English translation, this would be to say that ‘happiness is doing well and living well'. The word ‘happiness' does not entirely capture {{the meaning of the}} Greek word. One important difference is that happiness often connotes being or tending to be in a certain pleasant state of mind. For example, when we say that someone is “a very happy person,” we usually mean that they seem subjectively contented with the <b>way</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> in their life. We mean to imply that they feel good about the <b>way</b> <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> for them. In contrast, eudaimonia is a more encompassing notion than feeling happy since events that do not contribute to one's experience of feeling happy may affect one's eudaimonia.|$|E
