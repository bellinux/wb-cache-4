25|$|During their engagement, Lazarus {{brought her}} skis to the {{apartment}} Ruetten shared with Rasmussen {{and asked him to}} wax them, and despite Rasmussen's objections, he complied. Rasmussen felt this was a little strange, since Lazarus was dressed in flattering <b>workout</b> <b>clothes,</b> and after Lazarus left asked her fiancé if their relationship was truly over. Ruetten convinced her the two were just friends. A few days later Lazarus returned, in uniform and armed, after he had left for work, to pick the waxed skis up.|$|E
500|$|One well-received {{number was}} [...] "Keep It Gay", a song which in {{rehearsal}} {{had been assigned}} to several different performers before ending with Bob. The song was liked in part due to the novelty of its setting: it begins with Bob singing from the light bridge high above the stage; following a blackout the internal play performers take it up on the stage below, and following another blackout, the performers are seen in their <b>workout</b> <b>clothes,</b> at a rehearsal some weeks later. Hammerstein gave credit for the scene to Mielziner, and suggested that it demonstrated one way in which the book had affected the music.|$|E
5000|$|As {{written by}} Ellis, Bateman is the {{ultimate}} stereotype of yuppie greed: rich, shallow, and addicted to sex, drugs, and conspicuous consumption. All of his friends look alike to him, {{to the point that}} he often confuses one for another; they often confuse him for other people as well. Bateman takes delight in obsessively detailing virtually every single feature of his designer <b>clothes,</b> <b>workout</b> routine, business cards, alcoholic drinks, elaborate high-end stereo, and home theater sound system. He is engaged to an equally rich, shallow woman named Evelyn Richards. He has a mistress on the side (the fiancée of a gay colleague he despises) and has regular liaisons with prostitutes and women he encounters at clubs, many of whom end up being his victims. The one woman (and possibly the one person) in his life he has anything approaching feelings for is his secretary, Jean. She is the only person in his life who is not completely shallow, so he cannot bring himself to seduce, rape, or kill her. He casually acknowledges her as [...] "Jean, my secretary who is in love with me" [...] and introduces her in the narration as someone whom he [...] "will probably end up married to someday".|$|R

5000|$|Founder Lorna Jane Clarkson (née Smith) was {{a dental}} {{technician}} and part-time aerobics instructor who was {{dissatisfied with the}} <b>workout</b> <b>clothes</b> available to women in the late 1980s and started making her own. [...] Her designs proved popular with her students, who asked her to start making clothes for them too. In 1988, she decided to start making clothes as her full-time occupation. When she and her partner, Bill Clarkson, experienced difficulty finding stores interested in carrying the range, they decided to retail it themselves In 1990, they opened their first store, in an upper floor of Brisbane's Broadway on the Mall shopping centre.|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, the {{earliest}} saunas were Swedish bastus {{in the colony}} New Sweden around the Delaware River. The Swedish Governor at the time had a bathhouse on Tinicum Island. Today sauna culture enjoys its greatest popularity in the Lake Superior Region, specifically the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, especially the Keweenaw Peninsula, and parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Iowa, which are home to large populations of Swedish and particularly Finnish Americans. Duluth, Minnesota, at its peak, had as many as 14 public saunas. Indeed, among Finnish farms in Great Lakes [...] "sauna country", the cultural geographer Matti Kaups, found that 90% had sauna structures-more even than the farms in Finland. Elsewhere, sauna facilities are normally provided at health clubs and at hotels, {{but there is no}} tradition or ritual to their use. To avoid liability, many saunas operate at only moderate temperatures and do not allow pouring water on the rocks. A wider range of sauna etiquette is usually acceptable in the United States compared to other countries, with the exception that most mixed-sex saunas usually require some clothing such as a bathing suit to be worn. These are uncommon, however, as most saunas are either small private rooms or in the changing rooms of health clubs or gyms. There are few restrictions and their use is casual; bathers may enter and exit the sauna as they please, be it nude, with a towel, dripping wet in swimsuits or even in <b>workout</b> <b>clothes</b> (the latter being very unusual). Like many aspects of US culture, there are few prescribed conventions and the bather should remain astute to [...] "read" [...] the specific family or community's expectations. Besides the Finnish Americans, the older generation of Korean-Americans still uses the saunas as it is available to them. Sauna societies are beginning to emerge in colleges across America, with the first one being formed at Gustavus Adolphus College.|$|E

30|$|Height (cm) {{and body}} weight (kg) were {{measured}} after a 12 -h fast with the participants wearing surgical scrubs and in bare feet at baseline (prior {{to the start}} of each exercise program), during week 8 {{and at the end of}} each exercise program. Measurements were performed in duplicates to the nearest 0.1  cm and 0.1  kg, respectively with average values used to calculate BMI (kg/m 2). In addition, body weight was measured prior to every exercise session with participants wearing <b>workout</b> <b>clothes</b> and in bare feet. Fat mass and lean mass were measured prior to and at the end of each exercise program via dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA; GE Healthcare Lunar model 8743, Waukesha, WI). Subsequently, percent body fat was calculated (fat mass/body weight).|$|E
40|$|In lieu of an abstract, {{below is}} the essay 2 ̆ 7 s first paragraph. 2 ̆ 2 On {{the evening of}} August 7, 2010, I was driving back from Pittsburgh on a warm summer day. My old car didn‟t have air conditioning, so I was dressed in <b>workout</b> <b>clothes</b> to try to sweat out a hot ride home. I had just been at the Mathematical Association of America‟s Mathfest, their annual summer meeting. I left {{somewhat}} early {{in the last day}} of the conference so that I would be home before 8 : 00 pm, my daughter Aderyn‟s bedtime. I did indeed get home around 7 : 30. Aderyn went to bed, then I took a quick shower and went to bed myself. At 10 : 00, my wife, who was due to have our second child on August 15, started the beginnings of labor pains, which grew in strength. By 1 : 00 am, there was no doubt that the baby was coming a week early. I got up and got dressed, Sara got in the shower (to ease the pain a bit), and we contacted the babysitter. I went to get the sitter at around 3 : 00 am, and Sara and I went to the hospital. At 9 : 18 am the next morning, August 8, our second daughter, Ivy Elaina Gantner, was born. 2 ̆...|$|E
