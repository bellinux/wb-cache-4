40|$|Capacity {{management}} is challenging. Many decisions regarding capacity are made before full information is known, often requiring large and irrevocable expenditures. Moreover, {{the consequences of}} <b>wrong</b> <b>capacity</b> decisions critically affect the firm’s bottom line. In recent years, the capacity decision has become of particular interest, reflecting two principal trends. First, advances in information technology that provide huge amounts of data about operations and demand offer firms potential to utilize this big data in making capacity decisions. Second, although supply chains today are highly decentralized with complex topologies, many buying firms and suppliers aim to maintain tight relationships with initiatives such as supplier development, among which capacity investment is an important strategic decision. Corresponding to the two streams, we analyze a firm’s capacity management decision, how much capacity a firm should have and why, at both intra-firm and inter-firm levels. At the intra-firm level, we investigate how a firm should learn demand information and leverage the information in capacity decisions. In Chapter II, we formulate a firm’s capacity adjustment plan when the demand distribution is unknown as a stochastic dynamic program, and derive the optimal policy and date-driven heuristics. At the inter-firm level, using game theory, we examine how a firm should manage its capacity at a shared supplier given two contractual constraints: exclusive, where other firms cannot access the leftover, and first-priority, where they can. In Chapter III where firms compete and the capacity cost consists of a fixed and a variable portion, we find that firms tend to invest more aggressively under the exclusive contract. Therefore, sometimes the firm may benefit from letting a competitor free-ride on the invested capacity. In Chapter IV where firms {{may or may not}} compete and the capacity cost has a variable portion, we characterize two equilibria: a prisoner’s dilemma, where both firms choose the exclusive capacity which is not Pareto-optimal, and a free-rider equilibrium, where one firm chooses the first-priority capacity and allows the other with exclusive capacity to free ride. Both equilibria can be sustained when the firms serve independent markets, but not when they compete in a Cournot market...|$|E
40|$|Capacity {{building}} {{efforts in}} nonprofit or nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) {{are assumed to}} lead to improvements in organizational effectiveness. Donors, including private foundations and bilateral aid agencies, have increasingly funded NGOs to improve their capacities in various arenas, ranging from strategic planning and financial management to technology transfer and performance assessment. Despite the assumed benefits of capacity building programs, {{there is a growing}} concern that such assistance “often does not lead to lasting organizational improvement, and can even cause organizations harm ” (Blumenthal, 2001 : 1) or that sometimes “the <b>wrong</b> <b>capacities</b> may be enhanced, or the <b>capacities</b> of the <b>wrong</b> people may be strengthened, ” especially in turbulent environments such as in contexts of violent conflict in which development organizations provide relief services (Smillie, 2001 : 7) A key {{purpose of this paper is}} to take a look at some of the assumptions of capacity building in order to generate a more realistic perspective on its possible effects and uses. What kinds of capacity building activities are most commonly undertaken by NGOs and supported by donors or funders? What impacts do they have on organizational effectiveness, especially with respect to mission achievement...|$|R

50|$|Under the English {{common law}} {{the defense of}} infancy was {{expressed}} {{as a set of}} presumptions in a doctrine known as doli incapax. A child under the age of seven was presumed incapable of committing a crime. The presumption was conclusive, prohibiting the prosecution from offering evidence that the child had the capacity to appreciate the nature and wrongfulness of what he had done. Children aged seven to under fourteen were presumed incapable of committing a crime but the presumption was rebuttable. The prosecution could overcome the presumption by proving that the child understood what he was doing and that it was <b>wrong.</b> In fact <b>capacity</b> was a necessary element of the state's case. If the state failed to offer sufficient evidence of capacity the infant was entitled to have the charges dismissed {{at the close of the}} state's evidence.

The {{first part of the}} work was done with Prof. Rudy Marcus, the second and third parts of the work were done with Prof. Bill Goddard. Here I would like to summarize the results from each part briefly. In the first part, we propose doing Scanning Tunneling Microscopy(STM) current calculations with a new model in the spheroidal coordinate system. The tip is modeled as a hyperboloid. The electrostatic potential part of this model is solved exactly. The free electron model of the whole system is also solved exactly. In the second part, we found that the Nose Canonical Molecular Dynamics, the most commonly used CMD method, leads to the <b>wrong</b> heat <b>capacity</b> for the system and hence is inconsistent with the thermodynamics. To solve this problem, we propose Two Nose variable Dynamics by changing the dimensionality of the Nose variable s and its conjugate [ [...] . ] from one- to two-dimension. In the third part, The exact expression for the quantum statistical partition function in the canonical ensemble is given. The physical interpretation of each term for N-particle system is discussed. The new formula is applied to the weakly degenerate quantum ideal case. By analyzing each term in the expansion, it is possible that this canonical partition function can be applied to cases where both quantum correlation effects and particle interactions are important. ...|$|R

Analysing and ultimately managing stakeholders' views have been recognized as necessary {{for the success of}} projects or programs. This research set out to investigate the expectations of client and consulting organizations in the Nigerian construction industry on priorities in public project procurement or implementation. An opinion survey of client and consulting organizations in some selected states of Nigeria was done. A set of 155 questionnaires was administered through the use of purposive and snow balling techniques on clients and consulting organizations. 65 completed questionnaires were returned. The data collected was subjected to both descriptive and inferential statistical analysis. The results of the analysis indicate that project completion at 'least or budgeted cosf is regarded as the most important issue of emphasis by consulting organizations while 'project meeting transparency and accountability' requirements is the most important to client organizations. The results further suggest that there are no significant differences, between client and consulting organizations in the rankings of the six identified expectations on public sector project implementation. It is recommended that the homogeneity of perceptions by the two organizations can form the basis of intervention efforts for improvements in public sector project delivery. Furthermore, the result provide the stakeholders of public projects feedback on perceptions, which can be useful in planning for future public projects...|$|R
40|$|During {{last years}} {{extensive}} development of small hydropower plants has taken place, {{and many of}} that plants are frequently located in small catchments. Mainly there is no runoff data for these small catchments, because runoff gauging stations have been established in comparably larger catchments. For establishing runoff for small catchments it is common practice to downscale it from larger catchments &# 150; analogue catchments. For downscaling analogue stations should have nearly the same catchment characteristics, like area, lake percentage, elevation distribution, etc. Small hydropower catchments often don&# 146;t have lakes, it means that small catchments have faster runoff response and more &# 147;peaked&# 148; hydrographs, comparably to larger catchments. In this case scaling approach will lead to wrong design and disappointing results during operation. Underestimation of runoff data will lead to additional spill of water, and overestimation will bring to <b>wrong</b> installed <b>capacity</b> and may be would not be efficient at all. During past years consulting companies become very interested in more precise runoff data, even if it have been collected during not long time period. It has been decided to set a gauging stations near to projects and collect runoff data (even for short period). In the past 10 years SWECO AS company has collected runoff series for approximately hundred stations, which are located through all Norway. Collected runoff series are also very valuable for other hydrological computations, it could improve and adjunct NVE data for small catchment and supplement hydrological data where NVE has no stations. This study was made with permission of SWECO AS (Trondheim) {{and people who have}} paid for data collection. The objectives of the Thesis is to store all available runoff data to the database in proper format (using HEC-DSS programm), collect necessary information about each station and compute topographical and climatic parameters (using NVE Low-flow application), make a standardized description of each record (station) including all important information like location (GPS), map, photo, catchment characteristics, rating curve etc. and check the quality of data. In this project one of the objectives is to prepare runoff data series to transfer to NVE database in tidy and in the format that requested NVE. During Thesis work one of the objectives is to make an comparable analysis between SWECO stations data and NVE analogue stations. Data from NVE analogue stations was provided by NVE staff. Besides, relationship between topographical and climatic parameters with flow duration curves of selected SWECO stations should be estimated. </p...|$|R
40|$|Healthy {{development}} {{depends on}} the quality and reliability of a young child’s relationships with the important people {{in his or her}} life, both within and outside the family. Even the development of a child’s brain architecture {{depends on the}} establishment of these relationships. Growth-promoting relationships are based on the child’s continuous give-and-take (“serve and return” interaction) with a human partner who provides what nothing else in the world can offer – experiences that are individualized to the child’s unique personality style; that build on his or her own interests, capabilities, and initiative; that shape the child’s self-awareness; and that stimulate the growth of his or her heart and mind. Young children experience their world as an environment of relationships, and these relationships affect virtually all aspects of their development – intellectual, social, emotional, physical, behavioral, and moral. The quality and stability of a child’s human relationships in the early years lay the foundation {{for a wide range of}} later developmental outcomes that really matter – self-confidence and sound mental health, motivation to learn, achievement in school and later in life, the ability to control aggressive impulses and resolve conflicts in nonviolent ways, knowing the difference between right and <b>wrong,</b> having the <b>capacity</b> to develop and sustain casual friendships and intimate relationships, and ultimately to be a successful parent oneself. Stated simply, relationships are the “active ingredients” of the environment’s influence on healthy human development. They incorporate the qualities that best promote competence and well-being – individualized responsiveness, mutual action-and-interaction, and an emotional connection to another human being, be it a parent, peer, grandparent, aunt, uncle, neighbor, teacher, coach, or any other person who has an important impact on the child’s early development. Relationships engage children in the human community in ways that help them define who they are, what they can become, and how and why they are important to other people...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is part of}} the Technology and Intervention in Pregnancy and Childbirth track. Three main questions are the focus of this paper: First, how does ultrasound shape the relationship between woman and fetus? Second, which major cultural models of pregnancy does ultrasound mobilize? Third, what potential risks, harms and wrongs for women does ultrasound entail? In answering these questions, I consider multiple varieties of this medical biotechnology, including 2 D, 3 D and 4 D ultrasound. I argue that ultrasound intervenes in the woman-fetus relationship to alter both woman-fetus bonding and the social visibility of the pregnant woman. Ultrasound distances a woman from her fetus such that she must engage in a process of forming intimacy with the fetus through her interactions with the image provided. Negating the woman’s embodied intimacy with the fetus, pregnancy becomes a process of acquainting oneself with an interior entity which has been separated through a cultural understanding rooted in the prevalence of pregnancy monitoring techniques. With rapt attention being given to the technological quickening on screen, the woman whose uterus is featured recedes from visibility and recognition. I then turn to broader cultural considerations by analyzing the public meanings and models of pregnancy that ultrasound mobilizes. I comment on two prevalent representations of the woman-fetus relationship, as well as the cultural reconstruction of maternal and fetal subjectivity the models engender. The increased use of ultrasound in the clinical setting is intimately tied to the production of both models. The two models are (1) the container model and (2) the oppositional model. Next, I explore feminist responses to the effects of ultrasound on the woman-fetus relationship and to the cultural prevalence of models of pregnancy that ultrasound motivates, highlighting the limitations and pernicious effects of visual knowledge as the underlying, guiding epistemic approach at play. Such an approach harms women by objectifying and disembodying them. Moreover, ultrasound as an imaging technique falsely separates woman and fetus, ignoring the extent to which their modes of existence and corporeality are deeply intertwined. In short, the current predominant use of ultrasound prioritizes visual knowledge over embodied knowledge and in so doing, relegates women’s embodied knowledge to private impressions, thus undercutting or outright denying the privileged epistemic access women have to the fetus. While acknowledging the importance of feminist philosophical interventions into ultrasound that privilege embodied knowledge, I argue that such an approach misses several key risks, harms and wrongs of ultrasound. To address this problem, I develop an analysis of ultrasound as an epistemic moral injury. This concept brings together insights from Jean Hampton and Miranda Fricker. According to Hampton, morally injurious practices deny the equal moral worth of persons. They represent their recipients as having lesser moral standing or unequal moral value. Morally injurious practices bring about “diminishment,” or damage to the acknowledgement or realization of a victim’s value. Whether an action diminishes another depends not on whether a person feels denigrated or on a person’s perception of a practice, but rather on the interpersonal and cultural determination of the meaning of that practice {{in the context of a}} particular society. Viewing ultrasound through this lens, I maintain that in current obstetric practice in North America, women risk moral injury when undergoing ultrasound procedures. Such practices can diminish the moral standing of women, while inappropriately elevating the moral standing of fetuses to the status of persons with intentions, interests, mature consciousness, etc. In fact, ultrasound practices elevate the moral value of the fetus at the expense of the equal moral value of the woman. In short, ultrasound damages women’s equal moral worth. This represents one crucial, yet underexplored aspect of the risks, harms and moral wrongs of ultrasound. I then fuse Hampton’s analysis with insights Miranda Fricker offers in Epistemic Injustice (2007). I argue that we can recognize that women undergoing ultrasound risk not only diminishment as ethical beings, but also as epistemic agents, which is to say, they can be diminished, harmed and <b>wronged</b> in their <b>capacity</b> as knowers, and more specifically, as embodied knowers. This happens when they are not recognized as valuable, viable participants in epistemic exchanges. Pregnant women undergoing ultrasounds risk experiencing both testimonial injustice, which Fricker explains happens when “prejudice causes a hearer to give a deflated level of credibility to a speaker’s word” (Fricker 2007, 1) and hermeneutical injustice, which occurs “when a gap in collective interpretive resources puts someone at an unfair disadvantage when it comes to making sense of their social experiences” (Ibid.). Pregnant women risk undergoing testimonial injustice when they, as embodied knowers, are not recognized by doctors as knowledgeable about their own pregnancies. They risk experiencing hermeneutical injustice, when their embodied “knowledge claims fall into lacunae in the available conceptual resources, thus blocking their capacity to interpret, and thence to understand or claim a hearing for their experiences” to quote Lorraine Code’s insightful summary of Fricker’s concept (Code 2008). Thus pregnant women’s ability to understand their own pregnancies is impaired, as they are unable to render the embodied experience of their pregnancy fully intelligible to themselves or others. Ultimately, what the elevation of forms of visual knowledge over embodied knowledge sustains is a conferral of credibility excess on doctors and a corresponding credibility deficit on pregnant women. In the context of the ultrasound procedure, doctors and sonographers do not view women as equal or even reasonable partners in the epistemic interaction. The lack of uptake has very harmful consequences, as it results in an undermining of women’s reproductive autonomy and their self-trust, both as moral agents and epistemic agents, to extend Carolyn McLeod’s helpful concept (McLeod 2002). The erosion of their trust in themselves as embodied knowers can result in alienation and an unwillingness to draw on the epistemically privileged relationships they have with the fetus, which can be a source of crucial knowledge...|$|R
40|$| {{essential}} requirement necessary to establish criminal liability. Criminal capacity consists of cognitive component i. e. ability {{to distinguish between}} right and <b>wrong</b> and conative <b>capacity</b> i. e. the ability to act {{in accordance with the}} distinction. If either was lacking no liability would ensue. In S v Van Vuuren, the court expressed in unequivocal terms that the accused could not be held liable where failure to comprehend what he is doing is attributable to a combination of factors such as provocation or emotional stress. The very idea of allowing provocation to function as a defence excluding an accused’s criminal liability is inherently controversial. From a moral and ethical perspective people are expected to control themselves, even under provocation or emotional stress. To allow it to function as a complete defence as opposed to mitigating factor means that it gives credence to the belief that retaliation is justified {{in the eyes of the}} law and this is the very thing criminal law guards against. Despite the well established nature of the defence of non-pathological incapacity, the law has been thrown into flux by the decision of the Supreme Court of Appeal in S v Eadie which constituted a serious erosion of the notion of criminal capacity, with a concomitant “ripple effect” on other topics within the general principles of criminal law. The question this case has highlighted for South African law of non-pathological incapacity is whether the boundaries of the defence have been inappropriately extended. This is so since the court held not only that there is no distinction between the defence of automatism and nonpathological incapacity, and that it would have to be established that the accused acted involuntarily in order for her defence of lack of capacity to prevail, but furthermore held that the court should assess the accused persons evidence about his state of mind by weighing it against his actions and surrounding circumstances, thereby introducing an objective test. Theorists such as Burchell have considered this move “bold” and “encouraging” for its emphasis on objective norms, and the fact that it brings it into line with both the English and American jurisdictions, where not only is an objective element introduced into the enquiry, but where loss of self-control is not totally excusable since the law assumes that provoked party was not totally incapable of controlling anger. If an accused was unable to control himself, a full excuse would be defensible. The notion of capacity has its approximate equivalent in the English and American law of provocation where the jury must consider the subjective question of whether the accused was actually provoked to lose self-control, the defence requires that a reasonable person in the same circumstances would have lost-self control and acted as the accused did. The South African notion of capacity is examined with reference to the way provocation is treated in these jurisdictions. Should non-pathological incapacity be equated with automatism, the established precedent in provocation and other cases of non-pathological incapacity would have to be revised by implication, and would have serious implications for the principle of legality and restricting the scope of the defence for battered women. Furthermore, it is submitted that a move towards an objective test should not be followed. This is so since such an approach does not extend to encompass the battered woman’s mental and emotional characteristics including recognized psychological disorder symptoms. This results in the court not having any meaningful way to determine whether the battered woman lost self-control and furthermore it will lead to increasing attention being directed at how far the objective test be tailored to fit the capacity of the accused. The problem with the capacity test is that it has created via the Criminal Procedure Act a new element of liability by drawing from both the general physical and the mental liability enquiries. Therefore, by duplicating the voluntary act requirement under mens rea, the courts have asked the same question twice. Once the accused is shown to be acting voluntarily, there will be a measure of goal-directed conduct. Where goal-directed conduct is present, it necessarily implies that here must be a level of capacity present in the case of the defence of non-pathological incapacity. In other words, the question is not whether capacity is present, but to what extent it is present. This point is not acknowledged by our courts: the concept of psychological fault underlying South African law offers no explanation for the fact that culpability is capable of gradation. The effects of battering could be used to support a defence of diminished capacity, which focuses not on mitigating circumstances of the act, but rather on the actor’s inability to form the requisite mens rea for the offence charged. However, the introduction of such a defence could only be achieved by returning to the rules relating to provocation followed in South Africa prior to 1971. According to the specific intent doctrine, policy considerations require that an accused should not be completely acquitted. However, these considerations require that an accused should not be completely acquitted. However, these considerations also require that an accused not be convicted of murder but of culpable homicide. This compromise solution (of culpable homicide) can only be reached by treating provocation as a special defence, one which is not strictly adjudicated in terms of the general principles relating to culpability (mens rea). Furthermore, it is submitted that a subjective test must be applied, since Snyman’s objective-subjective test leads to an illogical confusion between the subjective and objective elements...|$|R
