The study purpose is to regenerate the wolfram oxides and the cadmium oxides from the wastes from {{the production of}} monocrystals in the cadmium <b>wolframate.</b> The interaction kinetics and the interaction mechanism of monocrystalline powders of cadmium <b>wolframate</b> with the alkali solutions and with the mineral acid solutions has been studied for the first time; the substantial distinctions in the interaction rate of cadmium <b>wolframate</b> with the muriatic acid {{in comparison with the}} interaction rate with the sulphuric and nitric acids have been brought out; the explanation of crystal formation during the ammoniacal desorption process of wolfram has been presented. Two variants of regeneration process of wolfram oxides and of cadmium oxides from the wastes from the production of monocrystals in the cadmium <b>wolframate</b> have been developed. The choice of alkali variant from two developed variants has been substantiated.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{photocatalytic}} removal of 400 ppb level of NO in air under visible light irradiation by utilizing three-dimensional (3 D) hierarchical bismuth tungstate (Bi 2 WO 6) microspheres. A facile microwave-assisted hydrothermal method involving bismuth nitrate and sodium <b>wolframate</b> {{was developed to}} synthesize the photocatalyst. The Bi 2 WO 6 samples were characterized by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman and ultraviolet-visible reflectance (UV-vis) spectroscopy. The relationship between the physicochemical property and the photocatalytic performance of the as prepared samples is discussed. The present work demonstrates that the 3 D hierarchical Bi 2 WO 6 microspheres are effective visible-light-driven photocatalytic functional materials for air purification. © 2010 American Chemical Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|The {{transportation}} of W in aqueous gas-phases at and above 500 °C is examined using thermodynamic data. The transport of W is possible as fluoride and oxifluoride. The deposition of wolframite continues with decreasing temperature and pressure. The stabilities of <b>wolframates</b> in hydrothermal solutions are examined for temperatures up to 300 °C with Eh-pH-diagrams, exchange reactions of wolframite with oxides, sulfides and dissolved ions. Fe 2 WO 6 becomes stable against Fe 2 O 3 + WO 3 above 126 °C. At 300 °C its range of stability begins at high pO 2 {{which is not}} realised in hydrothennal endogenous solutions. In consequence of the very low Gibbs energies of MgWO 4, CaWO 4 and BaWO 4, the minerals MgWO 4 and BaWO 4 should {{be more important than}} wolframite, if Mg and Ba coexist in solution together with W. Co and Ni also should be found as trace elements in wolframite, if Co and Ni were in solution in sufficiently high concentrations together with W. ...|$|R
40|$|Ethanol {{dehydration}} {{was investigated}} at atmospheric pressure with 1. 43 h- 1 WHSV in nitrogen, in the temperature range 423 - 773 K over titania and zirconia, as such and modified by addition of WO 3. As for comparison, data on other WO 3 -free and WO 3 -containing catalysts are also discussed: a strong Lewis acid (alumina), a covalent oxide (silica) and a basic material (calcined hydrotalcite). The catalysts were characterized using FT-IR of adsorbed pyridine and of <b>wolframate</b> species, and by UV-vis spectroscopy. The results presented here show that WO 3 /ZrO 2 and WO 3 /TiO 2 are excellent catalysts for ethanol dehydration. Their performances may compete {{with those of}} zeolites and alumina for conversion to diethyl ether and to ethylene. The addition of WO 3 to both ZrO 2 and TiO 2 introduces strong Brønsted acid sites {{that are supposed to}} represent the active sites in the reaction, but also inhibits the formation of byproducts, i. e. acetaldehyde and higher hydrocarbons. This is attributed to the poisoning of basic sites and of reducible surface Ti and Zr centres, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{functional}} interplay of calcium ions, {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) in the cells of wheat plantlets roots (Triticum aestivum L.) at the induction of their heat resistance by a short-term influence of hyperthermia (heating at the temperature of 42 °С during 1 minute) have been investigated. The transitional increase of NO and H 2 O 2 content, invoked by heating, was suppressed by the treatment of plantlets with the antagonists of calcium EGTA (chelator of exocellular calcium), lanthanum chloride (blocker of calcium channels of various types) and neomycin (inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol-dependent phospholipase C). The rise of hydrogen peroxide content, caused by hardening, was partially suppressed {{by the action of}} inhibitors of nitrate reductase (sodium <b>wolframate)</b> and NO-synthase (NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester – L-NAME), and the increasing of nitric oxide content was suppressed by the treatment of plants with the antioxidant ionol and with the scavenger of hydrogen peroxide (dimethylthiourea). These compounds and antagonists of calcium also partially removed the effect of the rise of plantlets’ heat resistance, invoked by hardening heating. The conclusion on calcium’s role in the activation of enzymatic systems, generating reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, and on the functional interplay of these signal mediators at the induction of heat resistance of plantlets by hardening heating is made...|$|E
40|$|The {{polynuclear}} compounds containing anisotropic metal ions often exhibit efficient barriers for blocking of magnetization at fairly arbitrary geometries. However, {{at variance}} with mononuclear complexes, which usually become single-molecule magnets (SMM) under the sole requirement of a highly axial crystal field at the metal ion, the factors influencing the SMM behavior in polynuclear complexes, especially, with weakly axial magnetic ions, still remain largely unrevealed. As an attempt to clarify these conditions, we present here the synthesis, crystal structures, magnetic behavior, and ab initio calculations for {{a new series of}} NiII–LnIII–WV trimetallics, [(CN) 7 W(CN) Ni(H 2 O) (valpn) Ln(H 2 O) 4]·H 2 O (Ln = Y 1, Eu 2, Gd 3, Tb 4, Dy 5, Lu 6). The surprising finding is the absence of the magnetic blockage even for compounds involving strongly anisotropic DyIII and TbIII metal ions. This is well explained by ab initio calculations showing relatively large transversal components of the g-tensor in the ground exchange Kramers doublets of 1 and 4 and large intrinsic tunneling gaps in the ground exchange doublets of 3 and 5. In order to get more insight into this behavior, another series of earlier reported compounds with the same trinuclear [WVNiIILnIII] core structure, [(CN) 7 W(CN) Ni(dmf) (valdmpn) Ln(dmf) 4]·H 2 O (Ln = GdIII 7, TbIII 8 a, DyIII 9, HoIII 10), [(CN) 7 W(CN) Ni(H 2 O) (valdmpn) Tb(dmf) 2. 5 (H 2 O) 1. 5]·H 2 O· 0. 5 dmf 8 b, and [(CN) 7 W(CN) Ni(H 2 O) (valdmpn) Er(dmf) 3 (H 2 O) 1]·H 2 O· 0. 5 dmf 11, has been also investigated theoretically. In this series, only 8 b exhibits SMM behavior which is confirmed by the present ab initio calculations. An important feature for the entire series is the strong ferromagnetic coupling between Ni(II) and W(V), which is due to an almost perfect trigonal dodecahedron geometry of the octacyano <b>wolframate</b> fragment. The reason why only 8 b is an SMM is explained by positive zero-field splitting on the nickel site, precluding magnetization blocking in complexes with fewer axial Ln ions. Further analysis has shown that, in the absence of ZFS on Ni ion, all compounds in the two series (except those containing Y and Gd) would be SMMs. The same situation arises for perfectly axial ZFS on Ni(II) with the main anisotropy axis parallel to the main magnetic axis of Ln(III) ions. In all other cases the ZFS on Ni(II) will worsen the SMM properties. The general conclusion is that the design of efficient SMMs on the basis of such complexes should involve isotropic or weekly anisotropic metal ions, such as Mn(II), Fe(III), etc., along with strongly axial lanthanides. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Double molibdates and <b>wolframates</b> (DMW) of {{alkaline}} {{elements are}} {{considered in the}} paper aiming at the condition investigation of the compound formation {{on the base of}} DMW, the growing of large, optically homogeneous monocrystals and the investigation of their physical properties. As a result conditions of the DMW formation in poly- and monocrystal kind have been substantiated and established. It has been shown, that monocrystals of CsLiMoO 341 and CsLiWO 341 in 100 - 300 K span undergo two successive ferroelectric phase transfers. It has been established, that the Na ion substitution on Li or Mo ion on W in the known crystals of NaBi(MoO 341) 321 leads to the improvement of their electric, elastic, acoustic and optical properties. The growing possibility of large, optically homogeneous and oriented monocrystals, possessing good ferroelectrical, acoustic-optical, laser properties has been shown.

40|$|Oxidic layer {{compounds}} Many oxidic layer compounds {{with the}} ability of intercalation and interlamellar ion exchange are used as colloidal particles or col-loidal dispersions [1, 2]. Most important are the clay minerals in clays (bentonites, kaolins, and common clays). More than 60 million tons of clays are used per year, {{and the application of}} most of this amount is based on the colloidal properties of the clay minerals [3]. A further group of inorganic layer compounds of technical interest are the layered double hydroxides. Crys-talline silicic acids provide alternative materials to the different forms of amorphous silica. The intercalation reactions of many other layer compounds such arsenates, molybdates, niobates, titanates, uranates, vanadates, and <b>wolframates</b> were first des-cribed by Lagaly and Beneke [4]. Several of these compounds are presently studied by Japanese groups because of interest-ing semiconductor, photocatalytic and luminescence properties. M(IV) phosphates are studied in our group as active compo-nents in proton-conducting membranes. Colloid chemistry of clay mineral dispersions The particular charge distribution of the clay mineral particles (constant layer charges and variable, pH dependent edge charges) is the reason of different types of particle aggregation which is of enormous technical importance [3, 5]. Depending on the mode of aggregation, bentonite dispersions are used e. g. for sealing work (plastering effect), as thixotropic agent in paints and drilling fluids, as suspending additives for pigments and pes...|$|R
