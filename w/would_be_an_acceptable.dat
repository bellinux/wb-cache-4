500|$|Some {{people believe}} that only {{individuals}} suffering from cancer or AIDS can receive hospice care. Hospice in the United States developed around the model of cancer care, with a relatively predictable pattern of deterioration. According to 2002's The Case Against Assisted Suicide: For the Right to End-of-life Care, [...] "60% of hospice patients have cancer." [...] But, patients can be on hospice for numerous other illnesses, such as end-stage heart and lung diseases, stroke, renal failure, Alzheimers, or many other conditions. Any diagnosis that <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>acceptable</b> cause of death on a death certificate is, if expected to be terminal, an acceptable diagnosis for hospice care.|$|E
500|$|During an {{operation}} in April 2013 an SASR corporal cut the right hands from the corpses of three insurgents after {{being told by}} a military lawyer that this <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>acceptable</b> way of obtaining fingerprints. After this incident was reported to the senior Australian command at Tarin Kowt the SOTG was withdrawn from operations for a week-long [...] "operational pause". One soldier remained under investigation for this incident in August 2015. The bulk of SOTG was withdrawn from Afghanistan in late 2013 {{as part of the}} Australian drawdown, although some special forces remain as part of the small Australian force in the country. SASR casualties in Afghanistan include five soldiers killed in action.|$|E

The proposed response stated only that Lithuania agreed to establish regular diplomatic relations, send a legation to Warsaw, and guarantee normal conditions of operation for a Polish legation in Kaunas.|$|R
25|$|In Portugal, {{having only}} one surname is rare, and it usually happens when both {{the parents have}} the same last name, to avoid {{repetitive}} combinations such as Ant√≥nio Santos Santos (which <b>would,</b> however, <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>acceptable</b> legal name). In Brazil, having only one surname is common in areas with large communities of non-Portuguese immigrants.|$|R

Evidently you were in some place that was besieged, eight years ago, and had to surrender. The {{garrison}} were promised their lives and liberty to depart. They were attacked at night by an armed party, who may have been Hyder's horsemen, but who were perhaps merely a party of mounted robbers, who thought that {{they might be able to}} take some loot. Most likely they were defeated, especially as you saw no other captives in the party, but in the confusion of the night attack, one of them probably came upon you, and carried you off, thinking you <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>acceptable</b> present here, and that he would get a reward for you from the sultan.|$|E

60|$|MY DEAR COLVIN, - I am just {{home after}} twelve days journey to Molokai, {{seven of them}} at the leper settlement, where I can only say that the sight of so much courage, cheerfulness, and devotion strung me too high to mind the {{infinite}} pity and horror of the sights. I used to ride over from Kalawao to Kalaupapa (about three miles across the promontory, the cliff-wall, ivied with forest and yet inaccessible from steepness, on my left), go to the Sisters' home, which is a miracle of neatness, play a game of croquet with seven leper girls (90 degrees in the shade), got a little old-maid meal served me by the Sisters, and ride home again, tired enough, but not too tired. The girls have all dolls, and love dressing them. You who know so many ladies delicately clad, and they who know so many dressmakers, please make it known it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>acceptable</b> gift to send scraps for doll dressmaking to the Reverend Sister Maryanne, Bishop Home, Kalaupapa, Molokai, Hawaiian Islands.|$|E

You see, we have searched the ground between that grove and our camp {{thoroughly}} to-day, and had he been killed there I think we should certainly have found him. Of course it may have happened further out on the plain if he was making his way out to join our square; but I should think {{he would never have}} done that, for the Arabs were swarming all round it. Besides, the Hussars were scouting about all over the plains this morning, and if they had seen the body of any of our men would certainly have reported it. The Arabs in fight never show mercy, but if they came upon him by himself they might very well have carried him off as a prisoner, especially if he made no resistance. You see, they are all slave-dealers at heart; besides, they might think that a white prisoner <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>acceptable</b> present to the Mahdi. Of course I know no more about it than you do, but I should say that the chances are quite as great of his being taken prisoner as of his having been killed." ...|$|E
60|$|The tidings of Pompey's death came to Caesar at Alexandria, {{and with}} them {{the head of the}} murdered man, which was sent by the {{government}} of Ptolemy, they supposing that it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>acceptable</b> gift to Caesar. Instead of being pleased with it, Caesar turned from the shocking spectacle in horror. Pompey had been, for many years now gone by, Caesar's colleague and friend. He had been his son-in-law, and thus had sustained to him a very near and endearing relation. In the contest which had at last unfortunately arisen, Pompey had done no wrong either to Caesar or to the government at Rome. He was the injured party, so far as there was a right and a wrong to such a quarrel. And now, after being hunted through half the world by his triumphant enemy, he had been treacherously murdered by men pretending to receive him as a friend. The natural sense of justice, which formed originally so strong a trait in Caesar's character, was not yet wholly extinguished. He could not but feel some remorse at the thoughts of the long course of violence and wrong which he had pursued against his old champion and friend, and which had led at last to so dreadful an end. Instead of being pleased with the horrid trophy which the Egyptians sent him, he mourned the death of his great rival with sincere and unaffected grief, and was filled with indignation against his murderers.|$|E

Employers that currently offer insurance have a five-year grace period after the act begins before they <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{subject to the}} standards. Individuals <b>would</b> <b>be</b> free to purchase their own private insurance, or work with the public option, in this period and afterward.|$|R
50|$|The {{frequency}} stabilised at 49.2 Hz {{for a short}} while. This <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> <b>an</b> <b>acceptable</b> frequency excursion, {{even though}} it was below the usual lower limit of 49.5 Hz, and recovery <b>would</b> not have <b>been</b> problematic. In fact, the fact that frequency stabilised at this level in spite of a beyond-design-basis event, could be viewed as reassuring. Ireland, which being a smaller system has a 'friskier' grid, sees about 10 frequency excursions below 49.5 Hz per year - her target frequency being 50 Hz, just as in Britain. Consumers would not have noticed the small drop in system frequency; other aspects of their supply such as voltage, remained perfect. There <b>would,</b> therefore, have <b>been</b> no consumer detriment; all <b>would</b> have <b>been</b> well at this point, had nothing further untoward occurred.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} antidiscrimination policy and provides a brief summary of its potential impacts. It appears that normative antidiscrimination lacks a coherent set of principles, proposed measures tend to be arbitrary and lead to inconsistent results. Implementations also disproportionally harm the social classes, whose protection or promotion <b>would</b> presumably <b>be</b> <b>acceptable.</b> <b>A</b> case <b>is</b> made of existing EU antidiscriminatory legislation, regulating the insurance market, including some rudimentary figures...|$|R

60|$|The courtiers {{followed}} {{on their}} master's heels, but the soldiers stood undecided. Ercole Piacentini looked at us, {{and spoke in}} an undertone to the Captain of the Guard. I thought they were discussing the possibility of boldly arresting Checco on the spot, which they doubtless knew <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> step very <b>acceptable</b> to Girolamo; but {{he was surrounded by}} his friends, and evidently, whatever Ercole and the Captain wished, they dared nothing, for the former quietly left the chamber, and the soldiers, on a whispered order, slid silently from the room like whipped dogs.|$|R

Many degreasing chemical alternatives are being promoted such as Ensolv and Leksol; however, each of these is based on n-propyl bromide which carries an R60 risk phrase of May impair fertility, and they <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>a</b> legally <b>acceptable</b> substitute.|$|R

Conversely, the mailing of letters containing the words [...] "kill Reagan" [...] and depicting the President's bleeding head impaled on a stake was considered a serious threat. An oral threat against the President unheard by anyone does not constitute a threat denounced by statute.|$|E

500|$|In March 1968, Lord Cobham, an MCC {{member who}} wanted the tour to go ahead, met Vorster, who told him that D'Oliveira <b>would</b> not <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>acceptable</b> {{selection}} to the South African government. Cobham communicated this information to an MCC Committee member, whose identity has never been made public, by private letter.
