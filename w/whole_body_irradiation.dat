40|$|Rationale: Human skin {{contains}} photolabile {{nitric oxide}} derivates like nitrite and S-nitroso thiols, which after UVA irradiation, decompose {{and lead to}} the formation of vasoactive NO. Objective: Here, we investigated whether <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> UVA <b>irradiation</b> influences the blood pressure of healthy volunteers because of cutaneous nonenzymatic NO formation. Methods and Results: As detected by chemoluminescence detection or by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy in vitro with human skin specimens, UVA illumination (25 J/cm 2) significantly increased the intradermal levels of free NO. In addition, UVA enhanced dermal S-nitrosothiols 2. 3 -fold, and the subfraction of dermal S-nitrosoalbumin 2. 9 -fold. In vivo, in healthy volunteers creamed with a skin cream containing isotopically labeled 15 N-nitrite, <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> UVA <b>irradiation</b> (20 J/cm 2) induced significant levels of 15 N-labeled S-nitrosothiols in the blood plasma of light exposed subjects, as detected by cavity leak out spectroscopy. Furthermore, <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> UVA <b>irradiation</b> caused a rapid, significant decrease, lasting up to 60 minutes, in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of healthy volunteers by 11 ± 2 % at 30 minutes after UVA exposure. The decrease in blood pressure strongly correlated (R 2 = 0. 74) with enhanced plasma concentration of nitrosated species, as detected by a chemiluminescence assay, with increased forearm blood flow (+ 26 ± 7 %), with increased flow mediated vasodilation of the brachial artery (+ 68 ± 22 %), and with decreased forearm vascular resistance (– 28 ± 7 %). Conclusions: UVA irradiation of human skin caused a significant drop in blood pressure even at moderate UVA doses. The effects were attributed to UVA induced release of NO from cutaneous photolabile NO derivates...|$|R

Histological results showed serious histopathological disorders in the liver, spleen and intestine after exposure to the single dose of gamma irradiation (5 Gy), manifested by inflammation and infiltration with mononuclear cells, haemorrhage, dilatation, congestion and widening of blood vessels and necrosis of cells with pyknotic nuclei. Exposure of rats to fractionated doses of <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> gamma <b>irradiation</b> (1 Gy) up to 5 Gy resulted in less severe histopathological disorders in liver, spleen and small intestine (jejunum), This indicates the beneficial use of fractionated doses in planning for radiotherapy in cancer patients, thus reducing the serious histopathological changes of radiation on the human tissues...|$|R

Skilful experiments led Loutit to form the opinion that, contrary to the prevailing view, the survival of irradiated mice after the implantation of haematropoietic tissue was due to colonization by living cells. The truth of this interpretation has been rapidly confirmed. Loutit {{was the first to}} recognize 'secondary disease' in irradiated mice restored by the transplantation of foreign cells, and his interpretation of the disease as the consequence of a reaction of the grafted cells against their recipient is now accepted. Loutit has further shown that a substantial proportion of mice with leukaemia can be cured by <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> <b>irradiation</b> followed by the grafting of bone marrow cells. Earlier, he separated the mechanisms of origin of congenital haemolytics and acquired icterus and developed a practical method of increasing the storage time of bllod for transfusion.

Prior <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> sublethal <b>irradiation</b> of CBA/Ca mice, but not BALB/c mice, resulted in strong resistance against infection with L. m. mexicana: no lesions developed {{at the site of}} cutaneous infection. Irradiated BALB/c mice did, however, develop small lesions which healed when infected with L. major. The protective effects of irradiation coincided with the development of delayed type hypersensitivity. Both naive and sensitized nylon wool purified lymphocytes could restore susceptibility to L. major in irradiated BALB/c mice but only lymphocytes from long term infected donor mice adoptively transferred a non healing response to irradiated CBA/Ca mice infected with L. m. mexicana. Non-irradiated, L. major infected, CBA/Ca mice, but not similarly treated BALB/c mice, were found to be resistant to subsequent infection with L. m. mexicana. On the other hand, irradiated BALB/c mice infected with L. major were resistant to subsequent infectious challenge with L. m. mexicana. We suggest that the susceptibility of CBA/Ca mice to L. m. mexicana is under the control of an as yet unidentified gene which is not dependent on the generation of T suppressor cells and is bypassed by previous infection with L. major. Therefore, BALB/c mice immunized against L. major by prior sublethal irradiation are also resistant to L. m. mexicana...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION: <b>Whole</b> <b>body</b> {{fractionated}} <b>irradiation</b> induces thymic lymphomas in C 57 BL/Ka mice after {{a latent}} {{period during which}} preleukemic cells progressively transform into leukemic cells within an abnormal thymic microenvironment. A bone marrow graft or repeated cytokine injections prevent lymphoma development. We think that these treatments restore altered mechanisms controlling apoptosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry in thymocytes from different groups of mice (control, preleukemic, prevented mice). RESULTS: The apoptotic rates did not change in freshly isolated thymocytes from different experimental groups. However, after culture, the level of apoptosis increased in preleukemic thymuses; and returned to normal value in cultured thymocytes from irradiated mice after lymphoma preventing treatments. Furthermore, thymic microenvironmental factors can control thymocyte apoptosis. CONCLUSION: We propose that after leukemogenic irradiation, there is an increase of cells with an activated suicide program, but that alterations of thymic environmental factors rescue them from apoptosis, allowing their further neoplastic transformation.

However, in the primary regenerative phase WR- 638 caused prominent changes of antigen expression on subcapsular and medullary TEC in irradiated rats.

CMV infects vascular endothelium with intermittent shedding of the virus and the development of latency. Methods We adopted a model of arteritis, developed by Presti et al.

Groups of mice include: 1) immunocompetent 129 S, 2) immunocompetent 129 S receiving <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> <b>irradiation</b> and MCMV, 3) IFN-γR-/- receiving MCMV, and 4) IFN-γR-/- receiving MCMV and <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> <b>irradiation.</b> Results Mice were inoculated with MCMV (5 x 10 4 or 1 x 10 5 PFU's) by i. p. injection; hearts and abdominal aortas were collected and histopathology evaluated. Infected immunocompetent animals exhibited widespread perivascular inflammation, which subsided by 8 weeks. Intimal pathology was not observed in any control group. Immunocompetent animals receiving MCMV and irradiation developed mild to moderate intimal lesions associated with medial and adventitial inflammation. IFN-γR-/- mice infected for 4 months and receiving <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> <b>irradiation</b> 2 months after infection developed pathology characterized by extensive adventitial and medial infiltrate and significant neointima, suggesting that infection and immunosuppression were co-requisites of neointima formation. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed myofibroblasts as a major component of neointima. The disease is characterized by up-regulation of growth factors (TGF-β 1, PDGF-A and B). Apoptosis was detected in the intimal layer of affected aortas. Active proliferation of myofibroblasts and infiltrating cells was also detected. Conclusion These results indicate that CMV infections may lead to intimal injury that results in the formation of neointima characteristic of autoimmune vasculopathies. </p...|$|E

A graft of normal bone marrow cells immediately after the last irradiation prevents the development of lymphomas; but when such a graft is performed 1 month later, it does not inhibit the emergence of tumors. In both cases the grafted precursors home and repopulate the thymus. However, the delayed graft does not exert any effect upon the altered epithelial component of TNCs, whereas the early one restores the numbers of TNCs and the function of their epithelial component. The results thus demonstrate that lymphoid thymic repopulation by a bone marrow graft is not sufficient to prevent the development of lymphomas and that there is an intimate relationship between tumor development and alterations of nurse cells microenvironment.

Also the P 50 of survival was determined in rats. Results:- For the control of these radiation-induced disorders, the radioprotective character of pentoxifylline has been evaluated. Acute -radiation-induced disturbances in trace metals levels in some organs were studied; specially Fe concentrations which were significantly increased (p 0. 05) in liver, spleen and intestine. Also -radiation-induced increase in malonaldehyde (MDA) levels as lipid peroxidation indicator and decrease metallothionein (MT) -induction as antioxidant defense induced in the cell. Pre-treatment with pentoxifylline was not effective against the changes produced by acute -radiation on metals studied, lipid peroxidation process and MT-induction. While post treatment showed positive effect on liver iron and metallothionein levels in liver and kidne...|$|R

A {{preparation}} of alpha-tocopherol monoglucoside (TMG) administered i. p. at {{a dose of}} 600 mg/kg immediately after <b>whole</b> <b>body</b> gamma <b>irradiation</b> was examined for its radioprotective efficacy towards bone marrow and peripheral blood nucleated cells. When mice received X-rays at a dose of 5, 6 Gy, a marked decrease in bone marrow karyocytes and a reduction of peripheral leukocytes within the early post-irradiated period were observed. However these changes were attenuated in TMG-treated mice. Sig-nificant protection of blood lymphocytes was found for the TMG group of mice. The return to normal value of the reduced blood leukocyte count starting from the 8 th day was more rapid in TMG-treated mice than in untreated irradiated mice. TMG administration was found to enhance hematopoietic recovery, {{as measured by the}} exceeded nucleated bone marrow cell count due to elevated amount of both lymphoid and granulocytic elements in the TMG-group, in comparison with that of both control irradiated and non-irra-diated animals. These findings indicate that the radioprotective effect of TMG is apparently realized through its influence on hematopoietic system...|$|R
