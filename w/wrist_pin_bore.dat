5000|$|The TRX250R was {{introduced}} for the 1986 model year to answer Suzuki’s LT250R, released the year prior. Honda borrowed many parts from its 3 wheel ATC250R for the Fourtrax’s design, including {{the engine and}} rear suspension. Although mechanically similar, Honda detuned the engine {{for use in the}} Fourtrax, through reduced compression and less aggressive porting, to ensure that the added weight of the quad would not adversely affect the reliability of the engine. [...] The 1987 model year, now absent the three-wheelers due to the CPSC ban, saw the engine receive a five-millimeter longer connecting rod, accompanied by a piston with a <b>wrist</b> <b>pin</b> <b>bore</b> raised five millimeters. Additionally, the cylinder was changed to include a bridged intake. Most of the chassis of the 1987 Fourtrax remained the same. The 1988 model year brought the most dramatic changes to the TRX250R. The compression ratio of the engine was raised to generate more power, bringing it nearly on par with Kawasaki’s powervalved Tecate-4. It was the chassis, however, that received the greatest attention, shedding 25 pounds over the previous year’s model. Additionally a shorter aluminum swing arm was added, but the frame lengthened such that the overall wheelbase was slightly greater. This shifted the weight bias rearward, curing the Fourtrax’s “loop out” problem. Aesthetically, the Fourtrax’s headlight was moved from the handlebars to a mount molded into the hood. This was also the only year to be available with red fenders. For 1989 the TRX250R received few changes. Most notable was the use of a needle bearing in the clutch pressure plate, for smoother action. This needle bearing was a necessary upgrade for the 1988 TRX250R, as well 3. The color was returned to white for its final year.|$|E

50|$|An {{internal}} combustion engine is acted upon by {{the pressure of the}} expanding combustion gases in the combustion chamber space {{at the top of the}} cylinder. This force then acts downwards through the connecting rod and onto the crankshaft. The connecting rod is attached to the piston by a swivelling gudgeon <b>pin</b> (US: <b>wrist</b> <b>pin).</b> This pin is mounted within the piston: unlike the steam engine, there is no piston rod or crosshead (except big two stroke engines).|$|R
5000|$|As <b>wrist</b> <b>pins</b> and pistons rely for {{lubrication}} {{and cooling}} respectively, {{on the oil}} being splashed around in the crankcase, these parts might have inadequate oiling if too much oil is pulled away by the pump. Installing piston oilers can circumvent this issue, but do so with additional cost and complexity for the engine.|$|R
50|$|The Powerplus {{engine was}} revised in 1917 with the barrels and pistons {{lengthened}} by {{a quarter of}} an inch and the piston <b>wrist</b> <b>pin</b> relocated below the piston center. This was done to reduce the occurrence of piston slap. The valve caps in the cylinder head were finned from 1917 until the end of production.|$|R

50|$|The {{unique design}} of this bikes piston makes {{cylinder}} maintenance difficult, as aftermarket companies (as of 2016) do not manufacture replacements and new old stock (NOS) parts are not widely available. Due to this, {{it is common}} practice to install the nearly identical 88-04 pistons in these bikes, which share both <b>wrist</b> <b>pin</b> and piston diameter measurements. Doing so will lower the compression ratio, but still function. Cylinders from later bikes are not compatible.|$|R
50|$|In 1912 Italian {{engineer}} Adalberto Garelli patented a split {{single engine}} which used a single connecting rod and long <b>wrist</b> <b>pin</b> which passed through both pistons. His company, Garelli Motorcycles, produced a 346 cc version {{for use in}} motorcycles for road use and for racing. Production continued until 1926, by which time Garelli was increasingly concentrating on the military market. Garelli motorcycles remained in business until the late 1990s, {{but they did not}} further develop or produce these engines.|$|R

5000|$|In {{internal}} combustion engines, the gudgeon <b>pin</b> (UK, <b>wrist</b> <b>pin</b> US) connects the piston to the connecting rod {{and provides a}} bearing for the connecting rod to pivot upon as the piston moves. [...] In very early engine designs (including those driven by steam and also many very large stationary or marine engines), the gudgeon pin {{is located in a}} sliding crosshead that connects to the piston via a rod. A gudgeon is a pivot or journal. The origin of the word gudgeon is the Middle English word gojoun, which originated from the Middle French word goujon. Its first known use was in the 15th century.|$|R

50|$|For 1967 {{he drove}} in the CanAm series {{and in a}} Corvette L88 Coupe at Le Mans, and led the GT class until a <b>wrist</b> <b>pin</b> failed putting the car out in the early morning. Later that month while driving a McLaren, at Watkins Glen, the {{steering}} arm broke at 150 mph approaching the Loop-Chute section of Watkins Glen (the current Turn 5, but without the bus stop, which was installed in 1992). Bondurant sustained serious rib, leg, foot and, most seriously, back injuries in the subsequent accident in which his car flipped eight times.

50|$|Under ideal {{engineering}} conditions, {{force is}} applied directly {{in the line of}} travel of the assembly. The sinusoidal motion, cosinusoidal velocity, and sinusoidal acceleration (assuming constant angular velocity) result in smoother operation. The higher percentage of time spent at top dead centre (dwell) improves theoretical engine efficiency of constant volume combustion cycles. It allows the elimination of joints typically served by a <b>wrist</b> <b>pin,</b> and near elimination of piston skirts and cylinder scuffing, as side loading of piston due to sine of connecting rod angle is mitigated. The longer the distance between the piston and the yoke, the less wear that occurs, but greater the inertia, making such increases in the piston rod length realistically only suitable for lower RPM (but higher torque) applications.|$|R

50|$|Finally, in 1993 Ford made {{available}} a turbocharged {{edition of the}} 7.3L. An internally wastegated, AR.82 Garrett T3 series turbo {{was used as the}} OEM for the factory turbocharger system. The system was tuned to minimize performance loss at high elevation, rather than to improve peak performance. A primary limiting factor to the performance potential of the engine is an incredibly restrictive stock down-pipe. It is commonly believed, but not officially verified, that this is deliberate and due to Ford's impending release of the T444E (Powerstroke) engine. Factory turbo vehicles received numerous additional improvements. Pistons had an enlarged primary compression ring, added intermediate ring, an enlarged ring land and <b>wrist</b> <b>pin,</b> as well as an anodized piston face. Other improvements included tweaks to the injection pump, and an upgraded oil-coolant heat exchanger.|$|R

50|$|What {{distinguished}} the Clerget {{rotary engine}} from its rivals (Gnome and Le Rhône) {{was that the}} Clerget had normal intake and exhaust valves unlike the Gnome, and the connecting rod arrangement was much simpler than the Le Rhone. A source of failure among the Clerget engines were the special-purpose piston rings, called obturator rings. These were located below the gudgeon or <b>wrist</b> <b>pin,</b> to block heat transfer from the combustion area to {{the lower part of}} the cylinder and overcome their subsequent distortion. These rings were often made from brass and only had a lifespan of a few hours. The Clerget engines were considered reliable but they cost more per unit to produce than their rivals. Unlike other contemporary rotaries in which the ignition system was either switched on or off to provide a rudimentary form of engine speed control, the Clerget featured a throttle.|$|R
