In the beginning, the hearer or reader is aware of only one of them. In the punch line, the second level comes up so suddenly that they start laughing. The sudden coming up of the second level is the point. For example: I only <b>want</b> <b>your</b> best – your money.|$|E
25|$|From 1860 many {{attempts}} {{were made by the}} Persian Jewish community to secure assistance from European Jews against Muslims. These requests were full of descriptions of poverty and persecution faced by Jews in Persia. The following is one example of such requests :"Allow us to present our supplications to you. You would not <b>want</b> <b>your</b> brethren, your own flesh and blood, to perish in frightful penury, to be victims of renewed persecutions which awaits them with each passing day. We are subject to the scorn of our enemies (Muslims) who view us as defenseless and do with us whatever they like. We live every day, hour and moment of our lives in constant dread of some new tragedy which they might bring upon us. our lives, property, honor, everything that is dear to us is at the mercy of their anger and hostility, a situation which is worse than slavery. Apostate Jews have the right to inherit their parents entire estate, the widow and orphans who did not abandon their faith must hand over their property to the apostate. A Muslim who kills a Jew will not go to a trial, even if there were witnesses to the crime, the Muslim will pay at most a fine for his deed. We are groaning under the burden of disgraceful taxes.|$|E

500|$|... "Bad Romance" [...] is an electropop and dance-pop {{song with}} house, new wave and techno influences. According to the sheet music {{published}} at Musicnotes.com by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, [...] "Bad Romance" [...] {{is set in}} common time with a metronome of 119 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of A minor, with Gaga's vocal range spanning from the low-note of E3 to the high-note of C5. The song follows in the chord progression of Am–C–F–C–G in the verses and F–G–Am–C–F–G–E–Am in the chorus. The song opens with Gaga singing {{a portion of the}} chorus, then transitioning into the [...] "Rah-rah--ah-ah-ah, Roma-roma-ma, Gaga-ooh-la-la" [...] hook, which—according to an interview Gaga gave for the Carpool Karaoke segment of The Late Late Show with James Corden in 2016—is an abbreviation of the word [...] "romance". It is followed by the sound of drum beats and keyboards. After the first verse, the pre-chorus follows, with Gaga voicing the lines, [...] "You know that I want you, And you know that I need you, I <b>want</b> <b>your</b> bad, your bad romance". The full-throated chorus then follows, where she sings, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>your</b> love, And I <b>want</b> <b>your</b> revenge, You and me could write a bad romance ... Caught in a bad romance".|$|E
500|$|Gil Kaufman from MTV News found {{similarities}} between the tempo of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] and that of Gaga's previous single [...] "Poker Face". Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noticed the 1980s influences that resonate throughout the track: [...] "If melodies could be time-stamped, these would have '80s' branded on their asses." [...] Daniel Brockman of The Phoenix pinpointed not only the declarations of liberation [...] "from a significant other", but the Depeche Mode and Madonna-esque qualities that permeate [...] "Bad Romance". To Pitchfork Media journalist Scott Plagenhoef, Gaga was able to transform her persona to reflect various female entertainers of similar vein, often reminiscent of the likes of Britney Spears, Madonna and Amy Winehouse. Simon Price from The Independent heard characteristics of Boney M in the chorus, and stated that {{the first line of}} the song, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>your</b> ugly, I <b>want</b> <b>your</b> disease", established the grim tone of The Fame Monster.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics address {{aspects of}} a bad relationship, but also {{reference}} fashion in the line, [...] "Walk, walk fashion baby, Work it move that bitch crazy."

[...] Virgil and Wyatt both testified they saw Frank McLaury and Billy Clanton draw and cock their six-shooters. Virgil yelled: [...] "Hold! I don't mean that!" [...] or [...] "Hold on, I don't want that!" [...] The single-action revolvers carried by both groups had to be cocked before firing.|$|E
500|$|In the lyrics, Goldfrapp and Gregory {{write about}} the passion found in romance and love; the former sings, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>your</b> love / All of the time" [...] during a [...] "slippery bass synth" [...] sound in the production. Opening the song, she demands, [...] "You're what I want / You're what I need / Give me your love / Make me a freak". Goldfrapp sings with robotic, or [...] "android"-like, vocals and moans, [...] "Ooh, connect me / Ooh, to the other side". The {{aforementioned}} lyrics were also considered {{similar to the ones}} in their 2005 song [...] "Ooh La La".|$|E

Sometimes, ideas came about during development {{that would have to}} be thrown out for not fitting with the game's original vision. [...] "We kill our darlings at Sucker Punch. It's not easy; it's necessary", Fox explained. Second Son displays a native resolution of 1080p at 30 frames per second.|$|E

500|$|The Gripen is {{compatible}} {{with a number of}} different armaments, beyond the aircraft's single 27mm Mauser BK-27 cannon (omitted on the two-seat variants), including air-to-air missiles such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder, air-to-ground missiles such as the AGM-65 Maverick, and anti-ship missiles such as the RBS-15. In 2010, the Swedish Air Force's Gripen fleet completed the MS19 upgrade process, enabling compatibility with a range of weapons, including the long-range MBDA Meteor missile, the short-range IRIS-T missile and the GBU-49 laser-guided bomb. Speaking on the Gripen's selection of armaments, Saab's campaign director for India Edvard de la Motte stated that: [...] "If you buy Gripen, select where you <b>want</b> <b>your</b> weapons from.

500|$|Many reasons {{have been}} {{suggested}} {{for the failure of}} Sinclair Vehicles and what Dale calls [...] "the jigsaw of the C5's disappointment". One of the receivers of Sinclair Vehicles, John Sapte, suggested that Sinclair had taken the wrong tack with its marketing of the C5: [...] "It was presented as a serious transport, when perhaps it should have been presented as a luxury product, an up-market plaything." [...] Ellar's director Maurice Levensohn took exactly this tack when he purchased Sinclair Vehicles' remaining stock, saying that his company would market them as [...] "a sophisticated toy": [...] "If you were a little boy, wouldn't you <b>want</b> <b>your</b> parents to get you one this Christmas?" [...] His strategy was notably successful; Ellar sold nearly 7,000 C5s at up to £700 each, far more (and at a higher price) than Sinclair had ever managed.|$|E
500|$|During the European {{leg of the}} Damage Inc. tour {{in support}} of Master of Puppets, the band complained that the {{sleeping}} cubicles on their tour bus were unsatisfactory and uncomfortable. To decide who received pick of the bunks, Kirk Hammett and Burton drew cards.

[...] Hammett replied, [...] "Fine, take my bunk, I'll sleep up front, it's probably better up there anyway." [...] Burton was sleeping shortly before 7am on September 27 when, according to the driver, the bus skidded off the road (the E4, [...] north of Ljungby), and flipped onto the grass in Kronoberg County. Burton was thrown through the window of the bus, which fell on top of him, resulting in his death.|$|E

[...] James Montgomery of MTV noted that the lyrics [...] "Suck my cockiness/Lick my persuasion", are, in his opinion, the best [...] "come-on" [...] line of 2011 alongside Lady Gaga's [...] "Heavy Metal Lover" [...] (Born This Way, 2011) lyrics [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>your</b> whiskey mouth/All over my blond south".|$|E

500|$|... "Madness" [...] is an {{electronic}} rock, synthpop, soft rock, and R song.

[...] In a separate interview, Bellamy stated the song was the band's attempt to strip down the sound of the album, and that the song has its roots in 12 bar blues with gospel, soul and R influences. He went on to conclude that, [...] "It's the song I'm probably most proud of on the album for sure." ...|$|E
