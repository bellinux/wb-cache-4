500|$|After {{getting a}} green-light from Rahman, they asked Scherzinger, the leader {{singer of the}} Pussycat Dolls, to write an {{interpretation}} of the song. Scherzinger was hesitant at first, stating in an interview that: [...] " [...] I <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> to touch it [...] afraid for people to hear it before I even wrote it". Scherzinger put her [...] "heart into writing the lyrics and put in themes from the film Slumdog Millionaire. Love and destiny were elements from the movie that she put into the track". She stated that she [...] "prayed every night to do this right". Fair and Iovine additionally hired Brick & Lace, The Writing Camp and Ester Dean to write their own interpretation of the song.|$|E
500|$|Producer Norman Dayron {{recalled}} the young Butterfield as [...] "very quiet and defensive and hard-edged. He was this tough Irish Catholic, {{kind of a}} hard guy. He would walk around in black shirts and sunglasses, dark shades and dark jackets... Paul was hard to be friends with." [...] Although they later became close, Michael Bloomfield commented on his first impressions of Butterfield: [...] "He was a bad guy. [...] He carried pistols. He was down there on the South Side, holding his own. I <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> of that cat". Writer and AllMusic founder Michael Erlewine, who knew Butterfield early in his recording career, described him as [...] "always intense, somewhat remote, and even, on occasion, downright unfriendly". He remembered Butterfield as [...] "not much interested in other people".|$|E
500|$|McGovern {{enrolled}} at small Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell {{and became a}} star student there. He supplemented a forensic scholarship by working a variety of odd jobs. With World War II underway overseas and feeling insecure about his own courage, McGovern took flying lessons in an Aeronca aircraft and received a pilot's license through the government's Civilian Pilot Training Program. McGovern recalled: [...] "Frankly, I <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> on that first solo flight. But when I walked away from it, I had an enormous feeling of satisfaction that I had taken the thing {{off the ground and}} landed it without tearing the wings off." [...] In late 1940 or early 1941, McGovern had a brief affair with an acquaintance that resulted in her giving birth to a daughter during 1941, although this did not become public knowledge during his lifetime. In April 1941, McGovern began dating fellow student Eleanor Stegeberg, who had grown up in Woonsocket, South Dakota. They had first encountered each other during a high school debate in which Eleanor and her twin sister Ila defeated McGovern and his partner.|$|E

500|$|A {{commonly}} cited {{story of}} how Moon joined the Who is that he appeared at a show shortly after Sandom's departure, where a session drummer was used. Dressed in ginger clothes and with his hair dyed ginger (future bandmate Pete Townshend later described him as a [...] "ginger vision"), he claimed to his would-be bandmates that he could play better; {{he played in the}} set's second half, nearly demolishing the drum kit in the process. In the words of the drummer, [...] "they said go ahead, and I got behind this other guy's drums and did one song-'Road Runner.' I'd several drinks to get me courage up and when I got onstage I went arrgggGhhhh on the drums, broke the bass drum pedal and two skins, and got off. I figured that was it. I <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> Afterwards I was sitting at the bar and Pete came over. He said: 'You ... come 'ere.' I said, mild as you please: 'Yes, yes?' And Roger, who was the spokesman then, said: 'What are you doing next Monday?' I said: 'Nothing.' I was working during the day, selling plaster. He said: 'You'll have to give up work ... there's this gig on Monday. If you want to come, we'll pick you up in the van.' I said: 'Right.' And that was it." [...] Moon later claimed that he was never formally invited to join the Who permanently; when Ringo Starr asked how he had joined the band, he said he had [...] "just been filling in for the last fifteen years." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{thought it}} was {{absolutely}} {{the worst thing that}} could possibly hit, I mean worst. It was so unlike anything that it had to be incredible. It was new, it was something that wasn't being done. ... So try to imagine, in a small rehearsal studio, four guys are up there playing. In front of them are Bill, Neil, Joyce, and myself. They finished the first song and no applause. Gene (Simmons) walks down to Neil Bogart, grabs both of his hands, and makes him applaud ... and Neil started applauding because he <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> And I said to myself at that moment, [...] "This I wanna be involved in" ... because that's the kind of balls you have to have to do anything.|$|E
2500|$|The {{record label}} speculated that Eminem {{would be the}} first artist to sell one million copies in an album's first week of release. These {{expectations}} placed a large burden on Eminem, who recalled, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> I wanted to be successful, but before anything, I want respect. [...] " [...] After the album was finished, the record label felt that there were no songs that had potential to be a lead single. Feeling pressured, Eminem returned to the studio and wrote [...] "The Way I Am" [...] as his way of saying, [...] "Look, this is the best I can do. I can't give you another 'My Name Is. ' I can't just sit in there and make that magic happen. [...] " [...] However, after the song was added to the album, Eminem felt the urge to write another song, and gave a hook to Dr. Dre for him to create a beat, and went home to write new lyrics; the song eventually became [...] "The Real Slim Shady". The song also discusses Eminem killing Dr. Dre. The producer reflected, [...] "It was funny to me. As long as it's hot, let's roll with it ... in my opinion, the crazier it is the better. Let's have fun with it and excite people. [...] " ...|$|E

2500|$|Raekwon {{released}} Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... as {{his first}} solo album, and the third seen from the Wu {{after the release of}} their debut album Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), with Method Man's Tical and Ol' Dirty Bastard's [...] released prior. The song [...] "Can It Be All So Simple," [...] from 36 Chambers, marked the first recorded exhibition of Raekwon and Ghostface Killah as a duo, as the two would further establish this alliance on Only Built 4 Cuban Linx.... Much of the content on the album deals with real life topics and situations that both Raekwon and Ghostface Killah commonly encountered and experienced while growing up in Staten Island, New York. In an interview with Wax Poetics, Raekwon explained [...] "I grew up in the street, so I talked about the shit I knew and saw. We did the hustlin' thing, we did the crime thing; we did all the things that made us feel like mobsters or Mafiosos in some way." [...] In a different article, Ghostface Killah recollected [...] "Back then I was punchin' a lot of rap niggas in their face, and niggas was getting beat up in the clubs. We were banned from everything. They wouldn't even let me in the Tunnel. Niggas <b>was</b> <b>scared</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> when I was out there wilding.
