25|$|This is {{most likely}} to occur in horses that graze sandy or heavily grazed {{pastures}} leaving only dirt to ingest. Foals, <b>weanlings,</b> and yearlings are most likely to ingest sand, and are therefore most commonly seen with sand colic. The term sand also encompasses dirt. The ingested sand or dirt most commonly accumulates in the pelvic flexure, but may also occur in the right dorsal colon and the cecum of the large intestines. The sand can cause colic signs similar to other impactions of the large colon, and often causes abdominal distention As the sand or dirt irritates the lining of the bowel it can cause diarrhea. The weight and abrasion of the sand or dirt causes the bowel wall to become inflamed and can cause a reduction in colonic motility and, in severe cases, leads to peritonitis.|$|E

50|$|Currently two {{separate}} farming methods are practiced: In the mountains it is pure breed {{in areas where}} {{it is the only}} one to be profitable. There is an extensive farming with the animals almost ranging free. This farm provides <b>weanlings,</b> young beef bulls and heifers for breeding. In the more favorable zone there are herds of female Corsican cows crossed with bulls of beef breeds like Limousin, Aubrac or Charolais.|$|E
50|$|<b>Weanlings</b> are {{not capable}} of reproduction. Puberty occurs in most horses during their {{yearling}} year. Therefore, some young horses are capable of reproduction prior to full physical maturity, {{though it is not}} common. Two-year-olds sometimes are deliberately bred, though doing so, particularly with fillies, may put undesirable stress on their still-growing bodies. As a general rule, breeding young horses prior to the age of three is considered undesirable.|$|E

5000|$|Equine {{herpesvirus}} 4 (EHV-4) is a virus of {{the family}} Herpesviridae that cause rhinopneumonitis in horses. It {{is the most important}} viral cause of respiratory infection in foals. [...] Like other herpes viruses, EHV-4 causes a lifelong latent infection in affected animals. These horses are usually the source for new infection for foals over two months old, <b>weanlings,</b> and yearlings. Symptoms include fever, loss of appetite, and discharge from the nose. Most infected animals recover in one to three weeks, but death can occur in environments with overcrowding and other stress factors.

Mueller, sold a 75 per cent share in Miss Andretti to Melbourne businessman, Sean Buckley and partner Gabriella Guenzi before she was transferred to trainer Lee Freedman. Her former trainer still continued attending her races, including the trip to England, and collected a percentage of prize money. In Melbourne she won in top company in 10 of her first 13 starts for trainer Lee Freedman.|$|E
50|$|ERBV's {{appear to}} infect most foals and <b>weanlings,</b> {{eliciting}} a low serum antibody response {{in stark contrast}} to equine rhinitis A virus (ERAV), which is the only species of the genus Aphthovirus that is not a foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), and appears to only infect horses once they begin training for racing (approx. 2 years old). ERAV enters the blood and elicits a very high serum antibody response that seems to then limit the spread of the virus by herd immunity, given that only approximately 40% of horses have detectable ERAV antibody. The low serum antibody response of ERBV appears to allow the continual, seasonal re-infection of horses. Horses are also known to shed ERBV for up to two years, possibly more.|$|E
50|$|Guttural pouch empyema is {{characterized}} by the accretion of purulent, bacteria infested exudate in the pouch. The bacteria is primarily Streptococcus equi, the infectious agent of strangles. Clinically apparent symptoms include painful swelling of the parotid area and recurrent infected nasal discharge, and in severe circumstances, difficulty breathing and abnormal head carriage may be observable. Fever, anorexia, difficulty swallowing and soft palate displacement {{may or may not be}} seen. Empyema is often secondary to guttural pouch tympany (distention of the pouches with air) in foals and <b>weanlings.</b> Arabians, in particular, are inclined to guttural pouch tympany, as many have a congenital defect in the pharyngeal orifices of the pouches. The infection can also be due to the rupture of the nearby retropharyngeal lymph nodes, usually caused by an abscess.|$|E
5000|$|Over time, most of Silver Pool {{became part}} of the 400 acre Prestonwood Farm, owned by Houston, Texas oilmen Jack, Art, and J. R. Preston, whose better known horses {{included}} Da Hoss and Victory Gallop. [...] In 2000, Kenny Troutt and Bill Casner, both with long-standing interests in horses, came together to purchase Prestonwood, renaming it WinStar Farm. [...] Included in the purchase were the stallions Distorted Humor, still standing at WinStar and the sire of 2003 Kentucky Derby winner Funny Cide, and Kris S.. Over the years, WinStar has steadily grown, incorporating land from the nearby Olsen, Johnson and Kinkead farms, and as of 2016, consists of over 2400 acre housing over 20 stallions, as well as a large broodmare band and facilities for <b>weanlings</b> and yearlings.|$|E
50|$|The {{downsizing}} {{that began}} {{following the death}} of E. P. Taylor resulted in large portions of Windfields Farm being sold to the University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT) and Durham College, which erected sports fields and parking lots on the farm's southeast corner. Farmlands {{on the east side of}} Simcoe Street became housing developments. By 2008, the once vast estate that at its peak was home to more than 600 thoroughbreds, had devolved to just a small private farm. In November 2009, the Windfields Farm breeding operations were wound up. Its broodmares and <b>weanlings</b> were sent to be auctioned at the Canadian Thoroughbred Horse Society Winter Mixed Sale and its remaining bloodstock was sold at the Keeneland Sales in Lexington, Kentucky. Shortly afterwards the contents of the farm, literally to the bare walls, was auctioned and the property was effectively abandoned.|$|E

5000|$|Fencing {{is a major}} {{expense of}} a horse farm, with wooden fences costing roughly $18,000 per mile to build, plus {{significant}} maintenance costs. Calumet Farm alone has roughly [...] of fencing, painted in the traditional white. Black wooden fencing is becoming more common because the cost of painting is significantly lower. At the major Thoroughbred stud farms, each stallion has a separate paddock located close to the stallion barn. Double fencing is used to provide separation between each stallion, as they can become quite territorial. Mares are kept in separate barns and are turned out to pasture in groups of varying sizes. <b>Weanlings</b> and yearlings also have their own barns and are turned out in their own pastures as much as possible. As a rule of thumb, pastures are sized to provide roughly [...] acres of grazing per horse.|$|E
50|$|Some people, {{whether through}} {{philosophy}} or simply due to being pressed for time, do not handle foals significantly {{while they are}} still nursing, but wait until the foal is weaned from its dam to begin halter breaking and the other tasks of training a horse in its first year. The argument for gentling and halter-breaking at weaning is that the young horse, in crisis from being separated from its dam, will more readily bond with a human at weaning than at a later point in its life. Sometimes the tasks of basic gentling are not completed within the first year but continue when the horse is a yearling. Yearlings are larger and more unpredictable than <b>weanlings,</b> plus often are easily distracted, {{in part due to}} the first signs of sexual maturity. However, they also are still highly impressionable, and though very quick and agile, are not at their full adult strength.|$|E
50|$|The income {{generated}} by Thoroughbred sales {{is one of}} the main drivers of the Thoroughbred industry. Keeneland Sales, based at Keeneland racetrack in Lexington, is the largest Thoroughbred auction house in the world. Horses sold by Keeneland won all three Triple Crown races in 2016, with Nyquist taking the Kentucky Derby, Exaggerator the Preakness, and Creator the Belmont. In 2016, Keeneland conducted three auctions that generated $523,566,500 from the sale of 6,485 horses. The September yearling sale represents the sale of horses from the breeding farms to race horse owners. In 2016, 2,792 yearlings were sold for a total cost of $272,890,500. The November breeding stock sale handles mares retiring from the racetrack, stock dispersals that occur when an owner leaves the business, and sales of older mares, often already in foal, between breeders. <b>Weanlings</b> are also sold at the November sales. In 2016, the November auction sold 2,653 horses for a total of $215,213,000. Sales figures vary greatly according to the economy. For example, total sales in 2007 were $815 million, but fell to only $396 million by 2009.|$|E

5000|$|Williams was {{employed}} specifically as a [...] "Woman Medical Officer"- a distinction she disagreed with, {{not least because}} it meant she was paid a lower rate than her male counterparts. Her role on the Gold Coast was to treat acutely ill infants and children, and give advice at a clinic level. Faced with the shocking rate of death and illness in the community, Williams trained nurses to do out-reach visits, and created well-baby visits for the local community. She also began a patient information card system to assist with record keeping. Williams, while supportive of modern medicine and scientific techniques, {{was one of the}} few colonial physicians who gave credence to traditional medicine and local knowledge. Williams noted that while the child mortality was high, newborns were not represented nearly as highly as toddlers between two and four years. The repeated presentation of young children with swollen bellies and stick thin limbs who very often died despite treatment, piqued Dr Williams' interest. This condition was often diagnosed as pellagra, a vitamin deficiency, but Williams disagreed, and carried out autopsies on the dead children at great personal risk to herself (there were no antibiotics in colonial Ghana, and she became severely ill with streptococcal haemolysis from a cut during one such procedure). Williams asked the local women what they called this condition, and was told kwashiorkor, which Williams translated as [...] "disease of the deposed child". Her findings- that the condition was due to a lack of protein in the diets of <b>weanlings</b> after the arrival of a new baby- were published in the Archives of Disease in Childhood in 1933.|$|E

40|$|Diarrhoea is a {{major public}} health problem in Thailand. During November 1998 -January 1999, a {{cross-sectional}} survey and a nested qualitative study were conducted to {{understand the relationship between}} feeding practices and weanling diarrhoea, and to describe the related local beliefs and practices in a subdistrict of northeast Thailand. A cluster-sampling method was used for selecting 156 <b>weanlings</b> aged 3 - 24 months. A structured interview was conducted with the main caregivers of these <b>weanlings.</b> The questionnaire used for the interview included items about feeding practices and diarrhoea-history of the <b>weanlings</b> in 2 months prior to the interview. Seven focus-group discussions with an opportunistic sample of the caregivers were held in the villages.
