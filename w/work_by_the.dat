5|$|Angel Beats! {{received}} generally positive reviews by critics. The {{integration of}} various individual elements together, such as musical performances, humor and action, was commended in one review but panned in another, {{saying that the}} story was overloaded with too many elements. P.A.Works was praised for the animation of the action sequences and attention to detail with the weapons used. A major flaw noted by critics, however, is that the anime is too short, which leaves many of the characters with untold back-stories. The anime was selected as a recommended <b>work</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> awards jury of the 14th Japan Media Arts Festival in 2010.|$|E

In 1794 the annual floods filled the whole of the Brue valley. <b>Work</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Commissioners of Sewers led to the 1801 Brue Drainage Act which enabled sections at Highbridge and Cripp's Bridge to be straightened, and new feeder channels such as the North and South Drains to be constructed.

5|$|Croatian {{authorities}} launched {{initiatives to}} exhume the bodies buried at Ovčara in 1993 and 1994, {{but those were}} unsuccessful. A five-member Commission of Experts appointed by the UN Secretary General came to Ovčara to exhume the victims in October 1993. However, they were prevented from carrying out their <b>work</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> local Croatian Serb administration. After the Croatian Serb authorities blocked several attempts to further investigate the mass grave at Ovčara, still under constant guard by the Russian peacekeepers, the site was visited by then-U.S. Ambassador to the UN Madeleine Albright in January 1994. She used the occasion to stress U.S. support for the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), which {{had been set up}} in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>work</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> breed {{clubs to}} ensure that any reoccurring health {{problems}} are dealt with, there are no especially common conditions affecting the Dandie Dinmont Terrier. However, minor problems affecting the breed can include hypothyroidism, primary closed angle glaucoma and Cushing's syndrome. In order to combat glaucoma in the breed, the breed clubs recommend that Dandies should have a procedure called a gonioscopy performed on them at regular intervals throughout their lives. The Dandie is also at slightly higher risk of canine cancer than average. The average life expectancy of a Dandie Dinmont Terrier is 1113 years.|$|E

5|$|Foreign operas {{were popular}} among the upper-class {{throughout}} the 19th century, while other styles of musical theater included operettas, ballad operas and the opera bouffe. The English operettas of Gilbert and Sullivan were particularly popular, while American compositions had trouble finding an audience. George M. Cohan {{was the first}} notable American composer of musical theater, {{and the first to}} move away from the operetta, and is also notable for using the language of the vernacular in his <b>work.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> beginning of the 20th century, however, black playwrights, composers and musicians were having a profound effect on musical theater, beginning with the works of Will Marion Cook, James Reese Europe and James P.

5|$|It {{is unclear}} if the castle and town played any {{part in the}} English Civil War between 1642–45, {{although}} cannonballs from the period have been discovered within the castle. Local oral tradition states that the castle was slighted, or deliberately destroyed, during the war. Stones from the castle were used for local building <b>work</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> 17th century onwards, and by the 18th century a house and shop had been constructed in the eastern bailey of the castle, along with a yard and garden. A gallows operated at the castle until 1790. Buildings continued to encroach on the castle. By {{the end of the}} 19th century a school and a house, Castle Lodge, had been built in the castle grounds. Other buildings were built as lean-to's against the castle walls.|$|E

5|$|Krueger {{decided that}} he needed to have his own {{strategic}} reconnaissance capability. In November 1943, he formed the Alamo Scouts as a special unit for reconnaissance and raiding.

The top graduates of the six-week training course were assigned to the Alamo Scouts; the other graduates were returned to their units where they could be used for similar <b>work.</b> <b>By</b> <b>the</b> end of the war, Alamo Scouts teams had conducted 106 missions.|$|E

5|$|Loading at Australian ports was {{frequently}} disorganised and sloppy. Manifests were not flown ahead, so New Guinea Force {{did not know}} the contents of a shipment beforehand. Some ships arrived without manifests. The labelling of contents was also poor, and boxes often had to be broken into to determine their contents. Even then it was not always apparent who the intended recipient was. Much of the problem was poor staff <b>work</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> inexperienced Movement Control staff at Advanced Allied Land Forces Headquarters (LHQ) in Brisbane.

5|$|Mellitus (died 24 April 624) was {{the first}} Bishop of London in the Saxon period, the third Archbishop of Canterbury, {{and a member of}} the Gregorian mission sent to England to convert the Anglo-Saxons from their native paganism to Christianity.
