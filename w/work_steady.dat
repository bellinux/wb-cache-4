Furthermore, it is shown how the nature of the ow depends on the manner in which the boundary conditions are applied by contrasting the solutions obtained from two commonly used approaches...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT – Industrialization of mango, {{including}} the peel, {{can be an}} alternative to reduce losses of non-standard fruits fresh of market and to lessen the generation of solid organic waste. Rheological behavior of mango jelly prepared with pulp, sugar and different concentrations of mango peel powder was investigated in this <b>work.</b> <b>Steady</b> state tests were run at 25, 40 and 60 °C and dynamic state tests were run at 25 °C. At 25 °C, all steady rheological data were well fitted to Herschel-Bulkey model. However, at 40 and 60 °C, the samples with higher peel powder content were not fitted to any classical model. It was proposed an equation that relates the effect of concentration and temperature on apparent viscosity of the samples. Temperature dependence on the apparent viscosity followed Arrhenius relationship and the mango peel powder concentration followed an exponential model. Moreover, based on the results, all formulations were classified as weak gels. 1...|$|E

40|$|For {{the stable}} and {{reliable}} operation of centrifugal pump, the transient flow must be studied and the separation region should be avoided. Three-dimensional, incompressible, steady, and transient flows in a centrifugal pump at specific speed within 74 were numerically studied using shear stress transport k-ω turbulence model, and an improved explicit algebraic Reynolds stress model–rotation-curvature turbulence model was proposed {{by considering the}} effects of rotation and curvature in the impeller passages in this <b>work.</b> <b>Steady</b> and transient computations were conducted to compare with the experiments. The comparison of pump hydraulic performance showed that the explicit algebraic Reynolds stress model–rotation-curvature turbulence model {{was better than the}} original model, especially between 0. 6 QBEP and 1. 2 QBEP; the improved model could enhance the head prediction of pump by about 1 %– 7 % than that with the original model. Then, the visualization of the vortex evolution was observed to validate the unsteady simulations. Good agreement was investigated between calculations and visualizations. It is indicated that the explicit algebraic Reynolds stress model–rotation-curvature model can successfully capture the separation flow...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAbsorption cooling {{technologies}} have been researched for many years. The gas fired absorption chiller is stable and high-efficient but has high gas consumption. The solar hot water driven absorption chiller {{is clean and}} energy saving but hard to <b>work</b> <b>steady</b> and continuously. In this paper, a system for cooling and heating based on an absorption chiller that can be driven by both gas firing and solar hot water was proposed and built. The system is a hybrid capable of solar cooling in single effect and gas fired cooling in double effect and also thus a combination. It has the advantages of both solar driven and gas fired absorption systems. This system works in solar driven mode (single effect) when the solar energy is enough. It works in gas fired mode (double effect) when solar energy is not enough or solar hot water temperature is low. The design and operation strategy is to use solar at first and gas fired as a backup, thus fossil energy saving is obvious. Year round operation of the system was recorded and analyzed in a commercial 5 star hotel. Compared with the gas fired absorption system, the gas/solar driven absorption system can save 49. 7 % of the gas consumption...|$|E

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. Heat exchangers for air conditioning applications are often of the fin and tube type. By choosing special fin geometries, the thermal performance of the heat exchanger can be enhanced. One of the recently proposed fin geometries for round tubes is the combination of louvers with a delta winglet vortex generator (VG). Several parameters impact the performance of this design, such as the louver angle and the angle of attack of the vortex generator. The fin geometry can be optimized by performing numerical simulations for different values of these parameters. In this <b>work</b> <b>steady</b> state computational fluid dynamics simulations are performed for a fixed inlet frontal velocity. Many authors use design of experiments techniques to evaluate the performance {{with a small amount}} of simulations. However, this often results in the assumption that many interaction effects between the parameters are negligible. In this work, a full factorial analysis has been done which is able to resolve all interactions between all parameters. It is shown that there are important interactions between the height of the VG, the aspect ratio of the VG and the louver angle. Taking these interactions into account, the optimal values of the parameters are determined with the objective of maximizing the heat transfer coefficient. dc 201...|$|E

The fact that growth of interconnected system is a continuous process, also these systems have been extended in different regions. In this research <b>work</b> <b>steady</b> state (SS) and transient stabilities along with swing equation and numerical solution using MATLAB / Simulink are studied. This work is done in two steps. In the first step, proper assumptions are made to linearize the system and then, the transfer function models of this system are developed for stability analysis. The performance of proposed linearized model of synchronous machine during normal and disturbed conditions is focused in Matlab/Simulink. This gives {{the understanding of the}} transient and dynamic analysis of PS stabilities. In the second step, the proposed methodology of the power system stability (PSS) with steady state (including transient and dynamic analysis), the application to sudden increase in power input, and the application of three-phase fault have been examined using Matlab coding (m-files) along with simulation models (Simulink). This makes power system stability studies easier to understand. The study also gives good understanding of maintaining reliable position of the system and new design of generating and transmitting plants. Furthermore, it provides information of relaying system and critical clearing time of circuit breakers, voltage levels and transfer capabilitie...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} <b>work</b> <b>steady</b> air {{injection}} upstream {{of the leading}} edge was used in a centrifugal compressor, Whose preliminary design of compressor injection systems can be modeled by a geometrical relationship between user-specified yaw angle and resulting blade incidence angle based on simple velocity triangles, the error between the best yaw angle obtained from this relationship and that obtained from numerical simulation is less than 3 %. To reveal the mechanism, steady numerical simulations were performed on high pressure ratio centrifugal compressor rotor operated with a rotor tip speed of 586 m/s. Parametric studies of the injection yaw angle was performed to determine the configuration that provide the best steady results for the compression systems studied in this work. The injectors were placed at short distance (ten percent of the inlet tip radius upstream of the compressor face) {{the objective of this}} was to achieve maximum control over the leading edge flow by varying individual injection parameters. The injection angle, α, was fifteen while the yaw angle, β, was parametrically varied. The results show that at design speed (n = 50 000 r/min) with injection flow rate equal to 3 % of the main flow rate and 25 degree air injection yaw angle can lower the mass flow rate at stall for approximately 7. 5 %...|$|E
