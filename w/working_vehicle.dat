5|$|The {{leader of}} the Fireflies, Marlene (Merle Dandridge), {{promises}} to double their cache in return for smuggling a teenage girl, Ellie (Ashley Johnson), to Fireflies hiding in the Massachusetts State House outside the quarantine zone. Joel, Tess, and Ellie sneak out in the night, but after an encounter with a patrol, they discover Ellie is infected. Full infection normally occurs in under two days, but Ellie claims she was infected three weeks ago and that her immunity {{may lead to a}} cure. The trio make their way to their destination through hordes of the infected, but find that the Fireflies there have been killed. Tess reveals she has been bitten by an infected; believing in Ellie's importance, Tess sacrifices herself against pursuing soldiers so Joel and Ellie can escape. Joel decides to find Tommy, a former Firefly, in the hope that he can locate the remaining Fireflies. With the help of Bill (W. Earl Brown), a smuggler who owes Joel a favor, they acquire a <b>working</b> <b>vehicle.</b> Driving into Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Joel and Ellie are ambushed by bandits and their car is wrecked. They ally with two brothers, Henry (Brandon Scott) and Sam (Nadji Jeter); after they escape the city, Sam is bitten by an infected, but hides it from the group. As his infection takes hold, Sam attacks Ellie, but Henry shoots him dead and commits suicide out of grief.|$|E
500|$|Two props of the Orb were made. One of {{the prop}} Orbs {{was used for}} stunts and had {{retractable}} rods. A second version was manufactured from cast bronze, making it heavy: [...] "You really didn't {{want to have to}} handle it", Campbell said. The rocket car seen in the pilot episode was built by special effects coordinator Kam Cooney and was a <b>working</b> <b>vehicle</b> with an internal combustion engine and throttle controls. Some items used in the show had been repurposed from older productions, and some would later be used in other shows. For example, the steam locomotive seen in the pilot episode was the same as the one used in Back to the Future Part III. Two of Carry's prop guns– rifles whose barrels were sawed-off in fashion of the Mare's Leg– were later reused in the science fiction television series Firefly.|$|E

50|$|In retirement, not {{all school}} buses live on as {{transport}} vehicles. In contrast, the purchasers of school buses use the large body and chassis {{to use as}} either a <b>working</b> <b>vehicle,</b> or as a basis to build a rolling home. To build a utility vehicle for farms, owners often remove much of the roof and sides, creating a large flatbed or open-bed truck. Other farms use unconverted, re-painted, school buses to transport their migrant workforce.|$|E

40|$|Reducing the {{environmental}} impact of ground vehicles {{is one of the most}} important issues in modern society. Construction and agricultural vehicles contribute to pollution due to their huge power trains, which consume a large amount of petrol and produce many exhaust emissions. In this study, several recently proposed hybrid electric architectures of heavy-duty <b>working</b> <b>vehicles</b> are presented and described. Producers have recently shown considerable attention to similar research, which, however, are still at the initial stages of development. In addition, despite having some similarities with the automotive field, the working machine sector has technical features that require specific studies and the development of specific solutions. In this work, the advantages and disadvantages of hybrid electric solutions are pointed out, focusing on the greater electromechanical complexity of the machines and their components. A specific hybridization factor for <b>working</b> <b>vehicles</b> is introduced, taking into account both the driving and the loading requirements in order to classify and compare the different hybrid solution...|$|R

5000|$|The {{financial}} crisis played a role, as GM {{was unable to}} obtain credit to buy Chrysler. Sales fell further as consumer credit tightened and it became much harder for people with average or poor credit to obtain a bank loan to buy a car. During 2007, nearly 2 million new U.S. cars were purchased with funds from home equity loans. Such funding was considerably less available in 2008. [...] In addition, stock prices fell as shareholders worried about bankruptcy; GM's shares fell below 1946 levels. Furthermore, the instability of the job market and individual consumers' finances discourages consumers who already have a <b>working</b> <b>vehicle</b> from taking on a new loan and payments, which affected almost all major manufacturers.|$|E

50|$|The Rover/NERVA program {{accumulated}} 17 {{hours of}} operating time with 6 hours above 2000 K. Although the engine, turbine and liquid hydrogen tank were never physically assembled together, the NERVA was deemed ready to design into a <b>working</b> <b>vehicle</b> by NASA, creating a small political crisis in Congress {{because of the}} danger a Mars exploration program presented to the national budget. Clinton P. Anderson, the New Mexico senator who had protected the program, had become severely ill. Lyndon B. Johnson, another powerful advocate of human space exploration, {{had decided not to}} run for a second term and was considerably weakened. NASA program funding was somewhat reduced by Congress for the 1969 budget, shutting down the Saturn rocket production line and cancelling Apollo missions after Apollo 17. Without the Saturn S-N rocket to carry the NERVA to orbit, Los Alamos continued the Rover Program for a few more years with Pewee and the Nuclear Furnace, but it was disbanded by 1972.|$|E
50|$|In 2004/5, a Land Rover enthusiast in the United Kingdom, Mr. Bill Hayfield, {{constructed}} a replica centre-steer vehicle after much study of remaining {{photographs of the}} original. The fully <b>working</b> <b>vehicle</b> demonstrated both the practicalities and drawbacks to the novel design. The replica used exactly the same engine and gearbox, and the necessities of building such a vehicle in a home workshop also pointed towards ways the Rover company would have built their vehicle without complex pressing and cutting machinery- such as the creation of curves on the bodywork by cutting slots in a straight sheet, applying pressure to the metal, allowing it to bend at an angle allowed by the expansion slots, then welding up the slots to form a solid, strong body panel. Many previously speculated on the feasibility of constructing a centrally-mounted steering system. Mr. Hayfield simply ran a chain drive from the steering column in the centre to the steering relay mounted under the left-hand wing, as used on the Jeep. The rest of the steering system was also the Jeep's re-circulating ball/trackrod system.|$|E
50|$|The {{second year}} of the {{competition}} was focused on teams implementing their chosen architecture into their project vehicle. After completing year one, each team was required to continue with their proposed architecture and any major changes to their design, or to the vehicle structure or safety systems had to be approved through a detailed waiver process where the reasons for and ability to make such changes while meeting competition goals are explained to competition organizers. Vehicle integration was {{the main focus of}} year two, where teams were required to have a <b>working</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{by the time of the}} year end competition. A strong focus was placed on powertrain development and a demonstration of energy use and emissions goals as defined by each team in their year one reports. Each team was also judged extensively on vehicle performance categories such as greenhouse gas impact, total well-to-wheels fuel economy, emissions, towing capacity, acceleration, off-road performance, and consumer acceptability. Furthermore, each team was required to submit a technical paper and perform an oral presentation (Challenge X d).|$|E
40|$|Most {{common type}} of object {{involved}} in fires in underground structures such as underground minesare vehicles [1 - 3].

This paper encompasses the measurement of the HRR for two full-scale fire experiments with vehiclesrepresentative for underground structures and the reconstruction of the measured HRR by investigatingwhat methodology that fits the measured values best. The main purpose of the methodologies is toprovide HRR curves without having to perform full-scale fire tests of the vehicles, which would be ofconsiderable value...|$|R
