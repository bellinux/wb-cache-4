2500|$|An initial {{candidate}} troupe was {{the existing}} BBC TV Beat Girls, but an ex-dancer from the Beat Girls, Jo Cook, was eventually engaged {{to create a}} troupe, the all-female Go-Jos., with Cook as choreographer. The Go-Jos also worked outside of Top of the Pops, notably for two years on the Val Doonican show – Doonican said in 1968 [...] "I thought the Gojos were fabulous, something really new. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> own television series I just had to have them with me." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 4, 2007, Couric did a one-minute {{commentary}} {{about the}} importance of reading, in a piece substantially lifted from a Wall Street Journal column by Jeffrey Zaslow. Couric claimed that she remembered her first library card, but the words were all from Zaslow's column. it was determined that a producer had actually written the piece. What made the plagiarism especially striking was the personal flavor of the video – which was subsequently removed from the cbsnews.com website after the situation came to light – that began, [...] "I still remember <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> first library card, browsing through the stacks for my favorite books." ...|$|E
2500|$|Earnhardt is {{a passionate}} Washington Redskins fan {{and has been}} known to have Redskins scores relayed to him during races. [...] "During the race season, [...] I'm under caution, I'm getting stats and numbers told to me over the radio during the race," [...] Earnhardt said. [...] "I've got to know. I can't {{concentrate}} on what I'm doing if I don't know what the Redskins are doing. My fans tell me if I lose, it ruins their week. But if the Redskins lose, it ruins my week." [...] Earnhardt once dreamed of playing football for the Redskins, but states that he [...] "wasn't built" [...] for it. [...] "I was 5–3 (5'3", 160cm) <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> driver's license at the age of 16," [...] he said, [...] "so I wasn't going to make much of a football player." [...] He currently owns a Learjet 60 private jet with the tail number N8JR.|$|E
60|$|Finally, <b>I</b> {{remember}} that <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> into <b>my</b> little bedroom, I was truly wretched, {{and had a}} strong conviction on me that I should never like Joe's trade. I had liked it once, but once was not now.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tommy Dermott," [...] <b>I</b> said, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>my</b> nerves back somewhat. [...] "Tommy Dermott, I'm {{going to}} lay you across my knee and give you the {{greatest}} thrashing a boy ever got in the world's history." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My friends," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>my</b> wits, [...] "this {{is neither}} the justice nor the {{moderation}} for which our province is noted. You have elected your committee of your free wills, {{and they have}} claims before you." ...|$|R
2500|$|Malwarebytes was informally {{established}} in 2004. CEO and founder Marcin Kleczynski, originally from Poland, {{was still a}} teenager attending high school in Bensenville, Illinois at the time, and {{was working as a}} technician in a computer repair shop in Chicago. He noticed that whenever infected computers arrived, they would generally reformat the computer, regardless if the infection was only minor. It was only when his mother's computer became infected that Kleczynski learned more about why the virus wasn't directly attacked, finding that neither McAfee nor Symantec would remove the malware from his system. He later recalled [...] "I've never been as angry as <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> computer infected", and professed that his mother told him to fix it [...] "under penalty of death". It was only after Kleczynski posted on the forum SpywareInfo, popular at the time, {{that he was able to}} learn how to cure it, which took three days. The company was unofficially founded after this, when Kleczynski conversed and became friends with several of the editors of the forum, who tempted him to buy an unused domain from them.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lord Evandale!" [...] exclaimed the veteran. [...] "I am as much pleased as <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> first commission. Claverhouse {{reported}} {{you were}} killed, or missing at least." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he went on. [...] "It's {{as though}} {{everything}} 'ad changed. More even than <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> money. 'Ere {{we are going}} to marry. It's like being someone else. What I feel is----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There, that's enough," [...] said Lestrade. [...] "I am a {{practical}} man, Mr. Holmes, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>my</b> evidence <b>I</b> {{come to my}} conclusions. If {{you have anything to}} say, you will find me writing my report in the sitting-room." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back to <b>my</b> room I {{locked the}} door behind me, {{and went to sleep}} in the dark. I did not want light just then--could not bear it.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> upon <b>my</b> legs, <b>I</b> {{found that}} every joint {{in my body}} was stiffer than the rustiest hinge ever heard of {{in the annals of}} doors! and my feet as tender as a chicken's, with huge {{blisters}} all over them. Bezeau, however, though a little stiff, was otherwise quite well, being well inured to hardships of every description.|$|R
6000|$|Blanche smiled graciously. [...] "You {{shall have}} him {{as long as}} you like, uncle. There's your hat," [...] she added, tossing it to her husband, gayly. [...] "I brought it in for you <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> own. You will find me on the lawn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I did enter, Dan {{looked up}} and said respectfully, 'Good-evenin', Mr. Clement,' and I felt so ashamed of my errand I turned to run. Everything whirled then--and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> {{bearings}} again Dan had me on one arm and Biddy was holding a bowl of soup to my lips." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{he tells}} it. It takes forty minutes by the watch. Did I laugh? Well, say! <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> face {{straight}} he calls in old Pete, the superannuated darky, and sends {{him down to}} the hotel to bring up my valise. It was Elmcroft for me while I was in the town.|$|E
5000|$|<b>I</b> was 16 <b>when</b> <b>I</b> quit high school. I didn't {{really mean}} to quit. I spent {{about a month}} {{going to the beach}} surfing and sunbathing while I was {{supposed}} to be in school: <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> caught, <b>my</b> mom was furious. I started to go back to school, and I was really enjoying it, and then I went to go do this film with John in Greece...|$|R
6000|$|... "I go {{back into}} my life, and I address myself to the noblest of created beings," [...] {{continued}} Pesca, vehemently apostrophising my unworthy self over the top rail of the chair. [...] "Who found me dead {{at the bottom of}} the sea (through Cramp); and who pulled me up to the top; and what did <b>I</b> say <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> into <b>my</b> own life and my own clothes again?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We were {{stopping}} {{at a hotel}} in Canada and I went out to do some necessary shopping. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back <b>my</b> mother was gone. She had received a bogus note, written I presume by Crabtree, asking her to come to me at once, as I had been taken sick in one of the stores. I immediately hired a detective, Mr. Ruff here, and we tracked Mr. Crabtree to the lake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “It is {{certainly}} the jug I bought for you,” said Wilfrid, looking closely at it; “it was in my portmanteau <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> bath-robe out this morning, before going to my bath, {{and it was not}} there when I unlocked the portmanteau on my return. Some one had taken it while I was away from the room.” ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> bearings, and {{carefully}} returned towards the ship. I had {{the mood of}} grave concentration of a boy who has lapsed into poaching. And the business only began to assume proper proportions for me as I got near the ship, to seem {{any other kind of}} thing than the killing of a bird or rabbit.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I've {{never been}} here before. If you knew'--a shadow coming over him--'what {{it is to}} be in such a place without a friend. I was crazy with glee, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> leave, at the thought of seeing London at last, but after {{wandering}} its streets for four hours, I would almost have been glad {{to be back in the}} trenches.' ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back to <b>my</b> {{breakfast in}} the Boar's coffee-room, I found Mr. Pumblechook conversing with the landlord.

60|$|I {{lay there}} for some moments slowly recovering, eyes on the far distant escarpments, now darkly red and {{repellent}} to me. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> up <b>my</b> legs were still shaky and I had the strange, weak sensation of a long bed-ridden invalid. Three attempts were necessary before I could trust myself on the narrow strip of shelf. But once around it with the peril passed, I braced up and soon reached the turn in the wall.|$|R
6000|$|... "How he lies! Oh! how he lies {{even about}} what our eyes saw," [...] said Cetewayo reflectively as I blundered past {{him back to}} my seat, on which I sank half swooning. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> wits again the figure that pretended to be Mameena was speaking, I suppose in answer to some {{question}} of Zikali's which I had not heard. It said-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> money, Mrs. Cliff, which, when {{compared}} to what your share must have been, was like a dory to a three-mast schooner, but still quite enough for me, and, perhaps, more than enough if a public vote could be taken on the subject, I was in Paris, a jolly place for a rich sailor, and I said to myself,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{told me he}} was nicer than a soldier, {{because he}} was all made of tin and shone beautifully in the sun. She said a tin man appealed to her artistic {{instincts}} more than an ordinary meat man, as I was then. But I did not despair, because her tin sweetheart had disappeared, and could not be found. And finally Nimmie Amee permitted me to call upon her and we became friends. It was then that the Wicked Witch discovered me and became furiously angry when I said I wanted to marry the girl. She enchanted my sword, as I said, and then my troubles began. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> tin legs, Nimmie Amee began to take an interest in me; <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> tin arms, she began to like me better than ever, and when I was all made of tin, she said I looked like her dear Nick Chopper and she would be willing to marry me.|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> out at <b>my</b> station I {{felt for}} the first time ill at ease. Why was I getting out at this wayside place, on to the great, raw high-road? I did not know. But I set off walking. It was nearly tea-time.|$|R
6000|$|... "The shell {{knocked me}} over, and didn't hurt me a bit. I {{was a little}} stunned, and some dirt was thrown over me, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> up on <b>my</b> knees I saw Jewell lying about six yards off--and his legs were all smashed about. Ugh! Pulped! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hurry not," [...] {{he said in}} a thick whisper. [...] "Her Majesty dwells on {{the next}} floor of this hateful tower, and since Asti is with her she cannot be surprised. Beware, then, of {{frightening}} her by your sudden appearance, lest she should run {{to the top of the}} pylon, and hurl herself into the Nile, as she has sworn that she will do. Halt now, and I will call to her <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>my</b> breath." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're in an outhouse, in {{the hands}} of planters; so I made out by what I heard them say <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> senses back; but I've no notion of what part o' the world we're in. Moreover, I don't care. A man with only one leg, no head, and an exposed brain, isn't worth caring about. I don't care for him--not a button." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{had ridden}} {{about two miles}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> fall, so we are a mile {{to the west of}} their camp. We will ride now a couple of miles due north.

We shall get three hours' rest before we have to move.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That was my mother's name," [...] she said, with {{a little}} laugh. [...] "I thought you knew it. But perhaps you didn't. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>my</b> divorce from Dick--you didn't know that either, I suppose; it's three months ago,--I didn't care to take my maiden name again; too many people remembered it. So after the decree was made I called myself Mrs. Merrydew. You had disappeared. They said you had gone East." ...|$|E
5000|$|Abdul {{criticized the}} way the program's {{segments}} were edited. She explained, [...] "That {{was hard for me}} to watch. Disturbing.

6000|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> back to <b>my</b> observatory, I found Mr. Jay digesting his mutton-chops in an armchair, {{with his}} pipe in his mouth. On his table were two tumblers, {{a jug of}} water, and the pint bottle of brandy. It was then close upon seven o'clock. As the hour struck the person {{described}} as [...] "Jack" [...] walked in.|$|R
60|$|Biddy said no more. Handsomely {{forgiving}} her, I soon exchanged {{an affectionate}} good night {{with her and}} Joe, {{and went up to}} bed. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> into <b>my</b> little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as a mean little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above, for ever. It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and even at the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind between it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been in so often between the forge and Miss Havisham's, and Biddy and Estella.|$|R
