After releasing the humans from her spell, Peacock Queen joins up with Big Green (classified as Hero 076) and uses her <b>wind</b> <b>attack</b> on the Zebra Brothers when they disrupt her tea time. Due to the Peacock's talents of telling time, the Peacocks are given the job of being Big Green's timekeepers.

The absolute value of the lift and moment coefficient increases with the increase of the ice thickness. In addition, the galloping of the iced subconductor may occur at the angle of <b>wind</b> <b>attack</b> near ± 20 ° and the wake increases the moment coefficient. The variation of initial ice accretion angle has a significant influence on the aerodynamic coefficients. The aerodynamic coefficient curves exhibit a “moving” phenomenon at different initial ice accretion angles.

40|$|While {{crosswind}} has {{a negative}} influence on natural draft dry cooling towers (NDDCTs) of all sizes, the influence may be fatal for short towers (height < 30 m) proposed for geothermal or solar thermal power plants. In a previous paper, the authors demonstrated the potential for tri-blade-like windbreak walls not to only maintain but significantly improve the short tower cooling performance. The effect of crosswind attack angle (windbreak walls orientation) was not examined in that paper. The present paper investigates that effect for a 15 m-high small-size NDDCT with horizontally-arranged heat exchangers. 3 D CFD models with different <b>wind</b> <b>attack</b> angles (0 °, 10 °, 20 °, 30 °, 40 °, 50 °, and 60 °) are set up and computed at different crosswind speeds. The {{results indicate that the}} way the cooling tower performance varies with the crosswind speed is highly sensitive to the <b>wind</b> <b>attack</b> angles. At attack angles of 0 ° and 60 ° the cooling performance is improved by windbreaks over the entire crosswind speed range investigated. Other attack angles lead to unfavourable effects at certain wind speeds. The differences are related to the turbulent airflow field in the tower bottom. The results suggest that the tri-blade-like windbreaks placements always with one symmetry axis alignment with the dominant crosswind direction. The findings could be used to determine the windbreak installation angles with respect to the most frequent direction(s) of the ambient wind in a given district...|$|E

Against {{the problem}} of the {{aerodynamic}} interference effects on aerostatic coefficients between parallel continuous rigid frame bridges with high-pier and long-span, the aerodynamic interference effects on aerostatic coefficients of main beam in the parallel long-span continuous rigid frame bridges were investigated in details by means of wind tunnel test.

The aerodynamic interference effects on parallel bridge main beam is shown mainly as follows: The drag coefficient of main beam downstream dropped and the drag coefficient of main beam upstream changed but not change significantly. There are also the aerodynamic interference effects of lateral force coefficient and torque coefficient between the main beams upstream and downstream.
