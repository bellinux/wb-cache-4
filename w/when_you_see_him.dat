6000|$|... "Good for you. Well, {{you tell}} him <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> And now, my lad, out you get, because if I'm {{interrupted}} any more I shan't get through to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{very good}} of him," [...] Godfrey said gratefully. [...] "Please tell him <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> how much obliged I am to him for his {{kindness}} to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's {{just doing}} it {{to get rid of}} you," [...] she ses to Mrs. Jennings, [...] "and if you give way you're a bigger silly than I took you for. Let 'im go on and 'ave his own way, and tell your {{intended}} about <b>'im</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>'im.</b> Arter all, <b>you</b> started it." ...|$|R
6000|$|FIRST JUDGE: This {{sounds as}} bad as truth. Guards, there, Lead forth the prisoner! [ENTER LUCRETIA, BEATRICE AND GIACOMO, GUARDED.] Look upon this man; [...] 20 <b>When</b> did <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> last? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> <b>you</b> {{will find}} me at Aikey's. I {{have to go}} there {{to get a lot of}} charts. I have only those for British waters.|$|R
6000|$|Have {{you thought}} of yourself, Arthur? What will you feel <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> with me? What will you suspect when you're working in your office and don't know where I am? ...|$|E
6000|$|Polly Ann replied, with a merry peal of laughter, [...] "You {{are both}} jealous of Tom--both of you. But, Davy, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> you'll love {{him as much}} as I do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come on Millie! Pick up the waukeesis. Here's old Garnet, looking {{just the}} same as ever. Devilish {{handsome}} fellow! You'll be glad you came <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> Beats the Zoo hollow!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{expect that}} since he lost your mother's {{influence}} and help he may have sunk lower than <b>when</b> <b>you</b> had <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> before. Did your father give you any directions about him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope Old Mother Nature {{will put}} him {{where we can}} {{get a good look at}} him," [...] replied Peter. [...] "Perhaps <b>when</b> <b>you</b> really <b>see</b> <b>him</b> he won't look so much like a Mouse." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That man {{exists for}} my torment," [...] she continued. [...] "He has always some mad notion in his head, and {{must always be}} visiting it upon me. <b>When</b> next <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> pray {{convince}} him how little I care for diamonds." ...|$|R
60|$|Tell Piggot, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> that {{we shall}} all be much pleased if he will come at his own {{convenience}} while you are here, and stay a few days with us.|$|E
6000|$|... "Malcolm {{would not}} mind a straw whether they kept a watch on him or not," [...] Ronald said. [...] "Will you tell him, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> next, that I got his message?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No trimmings," [...] he suggested. [...] "They don't muss up good {{material}} {{so that it}} {{can hardly}} be recognized. You can tell what a man is <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> or hear him talk." ...|$|E
50|$|I {{love that}} dude man. That guy, again.. style, creativity, {{technical}} abilities, precision. I {{would always be}} captivated by his skateboarding every time I would <b>see</b> anything from <b>him.</b> It seemed so easy and graceful <b>when</b> <b>you</b> would <b>see</b> <b>him</b> skate.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have a friend, Frans Hals--the {{painter of}} pictures--tell <b>him</b> <b>when</b> next <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> that I am glad his {{portrait}} {{of me is}} finished, and that I asked God to bless him for all his goodness has meant {{to me in the}} past." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>When</b> Howard talks, <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> in {{the down}} left corner, in the {{previous}} games the camera have changed entirerly to show the character in control.|$|R
6000|$|... "Leave a chimney-sweep alone <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> Chiltern. Should he {{run against}} you, then {{remember}} that {{it is one of}} the necessary penalties of clean linen that it is apt to be soiled." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You 'll {{know what}} to do <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> better than I can tell you," [...] {{answered}} Polly, readily yielding, for she knew they considered her [...] "quite one of the family," [...] as Tom said.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Say [...] "my lord," [...] young man, {{when his}} lordship does you the honour of {{speaking}} to you,' said the second gentleman mildly. 'If you don't know Lord George Gordon <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> it's high time you should.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Get me my great-coat; I'll take {{a little}} turn. Has the man brushed it? Did <b>you</b> <b>see</b> the man brush it yourself? What {{do you mean by}} saying he has brushed it, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> didn't <b>see</b> <b>him?</b> Let me look at the tails. If there's a speck of dust on the tails, I'll turn the man off!--Help me on with it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And don't {{be talking}} to her about money before she starts. I had rather you didn't;--you understand. But <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> Crofts, tell <b>him</b> to come to me. Indeed, he'd better come at once, if this thing is to go on quickly." ...|$|R
5000|$|Only some of Wood's {{dialogue}} {{was recorded}} while shooting. Wood {{said that the}} additional dialogue recording (ADR) was crucial to creating the character of Frank: [...] "I knew that the character had to come alive <b>when</b> <b>you</b> didn't <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> So most of that {{was done in the}} ADR stage in post-production; I felt the character was kind of created there, for the most part." [...] He told an interviewer, [...] "I always felt like the heart of the character and the depths of the darkness of the character were {{going to happen in the}} ADR stage." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is here. He {{sent his}} card to me. Of course, {{you will see}} him. Oh, Edna! don't do {{anything}} foolish <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him!</b> Don't go and throw away everything worth living for in this world! Heaven help you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall have}} {{something}} to do before night, I think. Tell your father, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> that I will not trouble him here much longer. But tell him, also, that I have no thanks to give him for his hospitality." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{really do}} not know. He will tell you <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> I suppose. I am only a casual {{acquaintance}} of his, and came on this errand to oblige him, solely because he seemed in great mental distress and was very urgent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen, son," [...] he said, and {{his voice}} rang. [...] "We-all know how you feel. An' if I'd had that one shot never {{in the world could}} I have picked the Papago guide. I'd have had to kill Rojas. That's the white man of it. But Yaqui was right. Only an Indian could have done it. You can gamble the Papago alive meant slim chance for us. Because he'd led {{straight}} to where Mercedes is hidden, an' then we'd have left cover to fight it out... <b>When</b> <b>you</b> come to think of the Yaqui's hate for Greasers, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> just <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> pass up a shot at one--well, I don't know how to say what I mean, but damn me, my som-brer-ro is off to the Indian!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; that is Murat {{with the}} black {{whiskers}} and the red, thick lips, and the brown of Egypt upon his face. He is the man for me! My word, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> raving {{in front of a}} brigade of light cavalry, with his plumes tossing and his sabre flashing, you would not wish to see anything finer. I have known a square of grenadiers break and scatter at the very sight of him. In Egypt the Emperor kept away from him, for the Arabs would not look at the little General when this fine horseman and swordsman was before them. In my opinion Lasalle is the better light cavalry officer, but there is no one whom the men will follow as they do Murat.' ...|$|R
60|$|You will be glad, I am sure, to {{know that}} my dear father is very well in health, and that all these changes are highly {{beneficial}} to him, {{and that he is}} very different indeed from what he used to be <b>when</b> <b>you</b> used to <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> There is an improvement in my uncle too, I think, though he never complained of old, and never exults now. Fanny is very graceful, quick, and clever. It is natural to her to be a lady; she has adapted herself to our new fortunes with wonderful ease.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{one thing}} you can tell Mr. Townsend <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> again," [...] he said: [...] "that if you marry without my consent, I don't leave you a farthing of money. That will {{interest}} him more than anything else you can tell him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you {{can look}} among the prisoners and see if your friend is here. If he is, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him</b> brought in you must come in and repeat your story. By the way, how did you {{understand}} what this Arab said about his father?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, se√±or," [...] she replied; [...] "but if {{our party}} had triumphed, perhaps {{deliverance}} {{would have come}} to me. Ah, no; I lost my relations long ago--all except my father. You shall know presently, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>him,</b> why our cruel enemies refrained from shedding his blood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I agree entirely, my dear, in {{your opinion}} of Moody," [...] he said. [...] "At the same time, I think it right to warn you that his zeal in your service may {{possibly}} outrun his discretion. He may feel too confidently about penetrating {{the mystery of the}} missing money; and, unless you are on your guard, he may raise false hopes in <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> next <b>see</b> <b>him.</b> Listen to any advice that he may give you, by all means. But, before you decide on being guided by his opinion, consult my older experience, and hear what I have to say on the subject. Don't suppose that I am attempting to make you distrust this good friend," [...] he added, noticing the look of uneasy surprise which Isabel fixed on him. [...] "No such idea is in my mind. I only warn you that Moody's eagerness to be of service to you may mislead him. You understand me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 18. To-day I dined with Mr. Stratford at Mr. Addison's {{retirement}} near Chelsea; {{then came}} to town; got home early, {{and began a}} letter to the Tatler,(33) about the corruptions of style and writing, etc., and, having not heard from you, am resolved this letter shall go to-night. Lord Wharton was sent for to town in mighty haste, by the Duke of Devonshire:(34) they have some project in hand; but it will not do, for every hour we expect a thorough revolution, and that the Parliament will be dissolved. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> Joe, tell <b>him</b> Lord Wharton is too busy to mind any of his affairs; but I will get what good offices I can from Mr. Addison, and will write to-day to Mr. Pratt; and bid Joe not to be discouraged, for I am confident he will get the money under any Government; but he must have patience.|$|R
6000|$|I {{did nothing}} at Dover (except for [...] "Household Words"), {{and have not}} begun [...] "Little Dorrit," [...] No. 8, yet. But I took twenty-mile walks in the fresh air, and perhaps {{in the long run}} did better than if I had been at work. The report {{concerning}} Scheffer's portrait I had from Ward. It is in the best place in the largest room, but I find the general impression of the artists exactly mine. They almost all say that it wants something; that nobody could mistake whom it was meant for, but that it has something disappointing in it, etc. etc. Stanfield likes it better {{than any of the other}} painters, I think. His own picture is magnificent. And Frith, in a [...] "Little Child's Birthday Party," [...] is quite delightful. There are many interesting pictures. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> Scheffer, tell <b>him</b> from me that Eastlake, in his speech at the dinner, referred to the portrait as [...] "a contribution from a distinguished man of genius in France, worthy of himself and of his subject." ...|$|R
