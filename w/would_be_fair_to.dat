5|$|The social {{contract}} theory of political philosopher John Rawls, developed {{in his work}} A Theory of Justice, was influenced by Kant's ethics. Rawls argued that a just society <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair.</b> <b>To</b> achieve this fairness, he proposed a hypothetical moment prior {{to the existence of}} a society, at which the society is ordered: this is the original position. This should take place from behind a veil of ignorance, where no one knows what their own position in society will be, preventing people from being biased by their own interests and ensuring a fair result. Rawls' theory of justice rests on the belief that individuals are free, equal, and moral; he regarded all human beings as possessing some degree of reasonableness and rationality, which he saw as the constituents of morality and entitling their possessors to equal justice. Rawls dismissed much of Kant's dualism, arguing that the structure of Kantian ethics, once reformulated, is clearer without it—he described this as {{one of the goals of}} A Theory of Justice.|$|E
25|$|As {{she grew}} older her {{determination}} to make literature her profession became very strong, and no discouragements ever altered her purpose. As {{she was the}} oldest of four children, her father {{did not feel that}} it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> the others to give her more than her just proportion of aid, since the others might also, in time, require assistance. Consequently, when at eighteen years old Miss Booth decided that it was necessary for her work that she should be in New York, she could not depend entirely upon her father. While not disregarding any expressed wish of her parents, she made her own decision as to the chief aim of her life. She was now obliged to leave them, and in some way to earn the difference between the sum her father could allow her and her expenses, and also to find time and opportunity for that other work to which she meant to make everything subordinate.|$|E

500|$|Voss {{returned}} from leave on 23 September 1917 {{not yet fully}} rested; as fellow pilot Leutnant Alois Heldmann observed: [...] "He had the nervous instability of a cat. I think it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> say he was flying on his nerves." [...] Nevertheless, Voss flew a morning mission and shot down an Airco DH.4 from 57 Squadron at 09:30 hours. Upon his return to his air base with bullet holes in his Fokker, he took advantage of Richthofen's absence at the Voss family hunting lodge to celebrate with a victory loop before landing. In contrast to Voss's usual tidy flying garb, he was wearing striped gray trousers, a dirty gray sweater, and tall lace-up boots.|$|E

500|$|The American team {{consisted}} of semi-professional players, {{most of whom}} had other jobs to support their families. Walter Bahr {{was a high school}} teacher, Frank Borghi drove a hearse for his uncle's funeral home and others worked as letter carrier or dishwashers. One player, Ben McLaughlin, had to withdraw from the tournament because he could not get time off work. The team had also been hastily assembled, and had only been able to train together once, and that was the day before they left for Brazil, which happened to be against the touring English team featuring Matthews (Matthews did not play in that game, as he was injured.) Three players—Joe Maca, Ed McIlvenny, and Joe Gaetjens, none of whom were U.S. citizens—had been added to the roster just before that game. [...] "We have no chance," [...] recently appointed coach Bill Jeffrey told the press; he also declared his players [...] "sheep ready to be slaughtered". The English Daily Express newspaper wrote: [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> give the U.S. three goals of a start." ...|$|E
500|$|Famously, when Commander Lord Cochrane {{captured}} the 32-gun Spanish frigate El Gamo in the 14-gun sloop [...] a promotion {{was the usual}} reward for such a feat of skill and seamanship. It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> argue {{that it would have}} been expected by both the commander and his friends and family. Unfortunately for Cochrane, the ship carrying the letter of that victory was intercepted and it was only received after he had himself been captured by the French and was facing a court-martial over the loss of his ship. A court-martial for losing one's ship was common practice at the time and in many cases, including Cochrane's, it was only a formality. It was only when Cochrane was cleared by the court that he could be promoted. Unfortunately the commander thought that the First Lord had deliberately withheld the promotion due to an unforeseen grudge; he held this opinion for the rest of his life. Cochrane had many powerful friends and relatives who lobbied continuously on his behalf. These solicitations may have had a negative effect on Cochrane's career as it is possible that Jervis became irritated by them.|$|E
500|$|The final {{piece in}} what Bowie called his [...] "triptych", Lodger (1979), eschewed the minimalist, ambient {{nature of the}} other two, making a partial return to the drum- and guitar-based rock and pop of his pre-Berlin era. The result was a complex mixture of new wave and world music, in places {{incorporating}} Hijaz non-Western scales. Some tracks were composed using Eno and Peter Schmidt's Oblique Strategies cards: [...] "Boys Keep Swinging" [...] entailed band members swapping instruments, [...] "Move On" [...] used the chords from Bowie's early composition [...] "All the Young Dudes" [...] played backwards, and [...] "Red Money" [...] took backing tracks from [...] "Sister Midnight", a piece previously composed with Iggy Pop. The album was recorded in Switzerland. Ahead of its release, RCA's Mel Ilberman stated, [...] "It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> call it Bowie's Sergeant Pepper... a concept album that portrays the Lodger as a homeless wanderer, shunned and victimized by life's pressures and technology." [...] As described by biographer Christopher Sandford, [...] "The record dashed such high hopes with dubious choices, and production that spelt the end—for fifteen years—of Bowie's partnership with Eno." [...] Lodger reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 20 in the US, and yielded the UK hit singles [...] "Boys Keep Swinging" [...] and [...] "DJ". Towards {{the end of the}} year, Bowie and Angie initiated divorce proceedings, and after months of court battles the marriage was ended in early 1980.|$|E

Depending on the specific context (time, era or society), {{the understanding of the}} beautiful often varied or varies. Also, within a specific context, quite different understandings of the beautiful can co-exist (partly in contradiction to each other). In that sense, beauty obviously depends upon culture.|$|R

It <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> say that the two towns are [...] "lost" [...] to Virginia, albeit for purposes of national defense. Also in 1943, the site of another nearby town, Penniman, was acquired and absorbed into the Cheatham Annex complex, which adjoins Camp Peary, and {{is part of the}} Naval Weapons Station Yorktown.|$|E

2500|$|Tuscan {{sculptor}} Arnolfo di Cambio {{entered the}} service of Charles I in 1277. Prior to arriving in Rome, Arnolfo di Cambio had worked on the pulpit for the Siena Cathedral {{as part of the}} workshop of Nicola Pisano, which was completed in 1268. [...] Arnolfo di Cambio completed a marble statue of the Charles I now housed in the Musei Capitolini. One of the first portrait statues since antiquity, the statue of Charles I helped set the precedent for royal portrait sculpture in the Renaissance. While the exact location of its original placement is not known, it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> assume that it stood in a monumental setting where it could be admired by the King’s subjects. The sculpture shows the king sitting stoically with a royal scepter in his right hand and a jeweled crown upon his head. [...] In addition to this medieval iconography, however, King Charles’s royal robes and lion headed curule seat have been borrowed from Roman sculpture. Arnolfo di Cambio portrayed this medieval Neapolitan King as an authoritative Roman Emperor, but has also succeeded in maintaining the individual likeness of his royal patron.|$|E
2500|$|... "Low mass" [...] {{is partly}} a {{relative}} label: the Earth is low mass {{when compared to the}} Solar System's gas giants, but it is the largest, by diameter and mass, and the densest of all terrestrial bodies. It is large enough to retain an atmosphere through gravity alone and large enough that its molten core remains a heat engine, driving the diverse geology of the surface (the decay of radioactive elements within a planet's core is the other significant component of planetary heating). Mars, by contrast, is nearly (or perhaps totally) geologically dead and has lost much of its atmosphere. Thus it <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> infer that the lower mass limit for habitability lies somewhere between that of Mars and that of Earth or Venus: 0.3 Earth masses has been offered as a rough dividing line for habitable planets. However, a 2008 study by the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics suggests that the dividing line may be higher. Earth may in fact lie on the lower boundary of habitability: if it were any smaller, plate tectonics would be impossible. Venus, which has 85% of Earth's mass, shows no signs of tectonic activity. Conversely, [...] "super-Earths", terrestrial planets with higher masses than Earth, would have higher levels of plate tectonics and thus be firmly placed in the habitable range.|$|E
