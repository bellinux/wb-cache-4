5|$|Makoto first appears {{when the}} cast is in sixth grade, though is in a {{different}} class. Known as Mako for short, though mostly only to Shuichi, Makoto was also assigned male at birth, but wishes {{to be a girl}} and shares Shuichi's interest in cross-dressing; it is this that spurs Makoto to become Shuichi's closest friend. Due to facial freckles and round glasses, Makoto is not able to appear as cute as Shuichi when wearing feminine clothes. Makoto's primary reason for wanting to be a girl may be due to an attraction to men, something Shuichi cannot relate to; Makoto is a romantic who wants to be in a relationship <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cool,</b> adult man. Makoto is unusually mature and is able to think calmly and objectively while providing advice to friends. Makoto also gets along well with boys and girls of the same age, because of good listening skills; Makoto often becomes an onlooker to {{what is going on in}} other characters' lives. Makoto is an only child whose parents run a bakery.|$|E
5|$|Shelley, {{who visited}} the toddler Allegra while she was being boarded with a family chosen by Byron, objected to the child's living {{arrangements}} over the years, though he had initially approved of Clairmont's plan to relinquish her to her father. During the summer of 1819, Allegra stayed with four different families and was abandoned by her nursemaid. Byron sent her to stay for long periods with his friend, British consul Richard Belgrave Hoppner, but Hoppner's wife didn't like Allegra and sent her to stay with three other families in as many months. Though he'd originally agreed to permit Clairmont to visit their daughter, Byron reneged on the agreement. Shelley often tried to persuade Byron to let Clairmont see her daughter and they thought of ways to regain custody of her. Clairmont was alarmed by reports in 1820 that her daughter had suffered a malarial-type fever and that Byron had moved her to warm Ravenna {{at the height of}} the summer. Clairmont wrote that Allegra must be moved to a more healthy climate if she was to survive and pleaded with Byron to send their daughter to her in Bagni di Lucca, a town <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cool</b> mountain climate. However, Byron didn't want to send Allegra back to be raised in the Shelley household, where he was sure she'd grow ill from eating a vegetarian diet and would be taught atheism. He pointed out that all of the other children in the Shelley household had died: the Shelleys' first three children had all died young and their fourth child, Elena Adelaide Shelley, died in a foster home in 1820 at age seventeen months.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1934 The {{object of}} this study was to compare the {{efficiency}} of <b>a</b> Hydro-Vac <b>cooler</b> <b>with</b> that of <b>a</b> 29 x 16 - 1 / 2 inch tubular surface cooler, as well as with that of two other coolers (tub cooler and sprinkler cooler). The <b>cooling</b> efficiency of <b>a</b> Hydro-Vac <b>cooler</b> was slightly lower than that of a 29 x 16 - 1 / 2 inch tubular surface cooler. The <b>cooling</b> efficiency of <b>a</b> sprinkler <b>cooler</b> was found to be higher than that of <b>a</b> tub <b>cooler,</b> but the cooling efficiency of either one of these two coolers was considerably lower than that of <b>a</b> Hydro-Vac <b>cooler.</b> When <b>a</b> Hydro-Vac <b>cooler</b> and <b>a</b> tubular surface <b>cooler</b> were thoroughly cleaned and sterilized there was no difference of' practical significance in the bacterial contamination of the milk by these two coolers. The flavor and odor of milk <b>cooled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tubular surface <b>cooler</b> or <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Hydro-Vac <b>cooler</b> was on <b>an</b> average slightly superior to the flavor and odor of milk from the same lot which was <b>cooled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tub <b>cooler</b> or <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sprinkler <b>cooler.</b> No difference was observed in the volume of cream forming on milk from the same lot when the milk was <b>cooled</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tubular surface <b>cooler</b> or <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Hydro-Vac <b>cooler</b> or when it was not cooled. Cooling the same milk <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tub <b>cooler</b> produced <b>a</b> slightly greater cream volume than <b>cooling</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> tubular surface <b>cooler</b> or <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Hydro-Vac <b>cooler...</b>|$|R
25|$|Evidence from {{microfossil}} records {{indicates that}} ferns and woody plants were present on Heard Island during the Tertiary (a period <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cool</b> and moist climate). Neither group of plants is present today, although potential Tertiary survivors include the vascular plant Pringlea antiscorbutica and six moss species. Volcanic activity has altered {{the distribution and}} abundance of the vegetation. The vascular flora covers a range of environments and, although only six species are currently widespread, glacial retreat and the consequent connection of previously separate ice-free areas is providing opportunities for further distribution of vegetation into adjacent areas.|$|E
25|$|He soon {{embarked}} {{on his second}} opera: Ruslan and Lyudmila. The plot, based on the tale by Alexander Pushkin, was concocted in 15 minutes by Konstantin Bakhturin, a poet who was drunk at the time. Consequently, the opera is a dramatic muddle, yet the quality of Glinka's music is higher than in A Life for the Tsar. He uses a descending whole-tone-scale in the famous overture. This {{is associated with the}} villainous dwarf Chernomor who has abducted Lyudmila, daughter of the Prince of Kiev. There is much Italianate coloratura, and Act 3 contains several routine ballet numbers, but his great achievement in this opera lies in his use of folk melody which becomes thoroughly infused into the musical argument. Much of the borrowed folk material is oriental in origin. When it was first performed on 9 December 1842, it met <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cool</b> reception, although it subsequently gained popularity.|$|E
25|$|Man Utd's {{game against}} Aston Villa was the late {{kick-off}} on 29 March, which allowed Arsenal {{to pull back}} United's lead in the league to just three points with a 3–2 win over Bolton. This meant that the Red Devils would have to win to restore their six-point lead over Arsenal; and win they did, as they put four goals past Martin O'Neill's side. Villa were first to threaten either goal, but it took just 16 minutes for Cristiano Ronaldo to get the opener, back-heeling the ball through Martin Laursen's legs and past Scott Carson in the Villa goal. Ronaldo then turned provider for the second goal on 33 minutes, Carlos Tevez heading home the Portuguese's cross at the back post. The loudest cheers of the game, though, did not come until after half-time, as Wayne Rooney, who had not scored at Old Trafford since October, bagged a brace. Ronaldo supplied the first, back-heeling {{the ball to the}} England striker, who rounded Carson before passing the ball into the net. Ronaldo then provided the assist for Rooney's second, nutmegging an Aston Villa defender to play Rooney in. Heartened by his first goal in six games, Rooney finished the move <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cool</b> shot, beating Carson on his near post. Rooney almost made it a hat-trick a few minutes later, but he was deemed to be marginally offside at the time of Owen Hargreaves' cross.|$|E

Ste was shown to have come from a broken home: raised by his alcoholic mother Pauline Hay (Julie Hogarth) and his abusive stepfather Terry Hay (Conor Ryan), with no contact with his biological father. Ste was regularly beaten by Terry, who was defended by Pauline. This led to Ste's violent nature and resentment of his mother.|$|E

2500|$|Tykwer {{describes}} {{the film as}} having [...] "a distinctly dark aesthetic", due to both the lack of adequate lighting during the film's time period {{and the nature of}} its storyline.

The film begins <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>cool,</b> monochromatic color palette, and as Grenouille discovers more scents, the palette warms and opens up. In the scenes where Grenouille goes to Paris for the first time, the filmmakers subtly added more powerful colors in the sets, costumes, props and lighting to represent Grenouille's experience of the new smells.|$|E
