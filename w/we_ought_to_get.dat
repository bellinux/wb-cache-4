6000|$|... "I'll help you," [...] exclaimed Scraps, {{coming to}} the boy's side. [...] "You pull the hair, and I'll pull you, and {{together}} <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it out easily." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{will depend}} upon the wind, lad. If we have luck, <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> there in four or five days. But {{sometimes}} the wind is mighty contrary around these parts." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was a pause. She seemed meditating further questions. Mr. Hoopdriver {{drew his}} watch hastily. [...] "I say," [...] said Mr. Hoopdriver, showing it to her, [...] "don't you think <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be <b>getting</b> on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. We've been {{stopping}} at Bossard's camp. I suppose <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be <b>getting</b> back there now, or he'll be wondering {{what has become}} of us. Besides that, we'll want some dry clothing. And you fellows will want some dry clothing, too. Otherwise you might catch cold." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We will {{certainly}} try before the fourteen days are up, Reuben; but with what success, {{of course we}} cannot say. But if we lay our plans well, <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> manage <b>to</b> <b>get</b> off." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then supposing {{we come to}} an understanding?" [...] went on Ferris, in a low tone. [...] "We both do {{work for}} Hardwick, and <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> more money for it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A rope {{would be}} useful, {{but if we}} can reach the shelf, <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> down," [...] he said. [...] "I'll try to make it. Lie across the stone and give me your hands." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't borrow for less. However, {{if we use}} {{the money}} judiciously, <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{something}} back by higher rents. Lang and Grey, for example, would {{pay a little more}} for the improvements they require." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, Griffith has {{tired of}} rocking in his pillowed cradle," [...] he muttered, [...] "and {{will give us}} a pull to the frigate, when <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> be <b>getting</b> the {{schooner}} out of this hard-featured landscape. This is just such a place as one of your sighing lovers would doat on; a little land, a little water, and a good deal of rock. Damme, long Tom, but I am more than half of your mind, that an island now and then is all the terra firma that a seaman needs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess you're right there," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "And that's {{one reason}} I think <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> back <b>to</b> Crumville. But just the same, I'd hate <b>to</b> <b>get</b> stuck {{somewhere along the}} road, as he says. We boys might be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of it along with Wash, but we couldn't expect the girls to do any tramping in such deep snow and in such a wind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, gentlemen, I {{shall be}} delighted to have you as my guests {{as long as you}} are willing to stay." [...] "We are greatly obliged to you," [...] Harry said, [...] "and will gladly be your guests. To-morrow the animals need a rest, and we shall enjoy one too. Next morning we must be going on, as we have been away longer than <b>we</b> <b>ought,</b> and want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> down <b>to</b> Lima quickly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't wish to {{innovate}} unduly," [...] {{he used to}} say. [...] "But <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in some German, you know,--for those who like it. The army men will be wanting it some of these days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can take}} it that way," [...] growled Gulden. [...] "I want gold." [...] "I'm mighty glad, Gulden," [...] replied Kells, and {{he looked as if}} he meant it. [...] "I need you. <b>We</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> along.... Here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "More {{difficult}} than they imagine. The coffer itself is an inch thick, and the lock will stand anything but dynamite. However, I hear that they've engaged a professional burglar, so <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some amusement out of it." ...|$|E

No book, I believe, is ever worth half so much to its reader as one that has been coveted for a year at a bookstall, and bought out of saved halfpence; and perhaps a day or two's fasting. That's the way <b>to</b> <b>get</b> at the cream of a book. And I should say more on this matter, and protest as energetically as I could against the plague of cheap literature, with which we are just now afflicted, but that I fear your calling me to order, as being unpractical, because I don't quite see my way at present to making {{everybody}} fast for their books. But one may see that a thing is desirable and possible, even though one may not at once know the best way to it,--and in my island of Barataria, when I get it well into order, I assure you no book shall be sold for less than a pound sterling; if it can be published cheaper than that, the surplus shall all go into my treasury, and save my subjects taxation in other directions; only people really poor, who cannot pay the pound, shall be supplied with the books they want for nothing, in a certain limited quantity. I haven't made up my mind about the number yet, and there are several other points in the system yet unsettled; when they are all determined, if you will allow me, I will come and give you another lecture, on the political economy of literature.[10] ...|$|R

Your fragments of broken admirations will not, when they are put together, make up one whole admiration; two and two, in this case, do not make four, nor anything like four. Your good picture, or book, or work of art of any kind, is always in some degree fenced and closed about with difficulty. You may think of it as of a kind of cocoanut, with very often rather an unseemly shell, but good milk and kernel inside. Now, if you possess twenty cocoanuts, and being thirsty, go impatiently from one to the other, giving only a single scratch with the point of your knife to the shell of each, you will get no milk from all the twenty. But if you leave nineteen of them alone, and give twenty cuts to the shell of one, you will get through it, and at the milk of it. And the tendency of the human mind is always <b>to</b> <b>get</b> tired before it has made its twenty cuts; and to try another nut: and moreover, even if it has perseverance enough to crack its nuts, it is sure to try to eat too many, and to choke itself. Hence, it is wisely appointed for us that few of the things we desire can be had without considerable labour, and at considerable intervals of time. We cannot generally get our dinner without working for it, and that gives us appetite for it, we cannot get our holiday without waiting for it, and that gives us zest for it; and <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> <b>get</b> our picture without paying for it, and that gives us a mind to look at it.|$|R
6000|$|Pardon me, I am not {{prepared}} to admit that. I rather side with the selfish objectors, and believe that art <b>ought</b> not <b>to</b> be made cheap, beyond a certain point; {{for the amount of}} pleasure that you can receive from any great work, depends wholly on the quantity of attention and energy of mind you can bring to bear upon it. Now, that attention and energy depend much more on the freshness of the thing than you would at all suppose; unless you very carefully studied the movements of your own minds. If you see things of the same kind and of equal value very frequently, your reverence for them is infallibly diminished, your powers of attention get gradually wearied, and your interest and enthusiasm worn out; and you cannot in that state bring to any given work the energy necessary to enjoy it. If, indeed, the question were only between enjoying a great many pictures each a little, or one picture very much, the sum of enjoyment being in each case the same, you might rationally desire to possess rather the larger quantity, than the small; both because one work of art always in some sort illustrates another, and because quantity diminishes the chances of destruction.

6000|$|It {{was nearly}} ten o'clock that evening before he reached home, {{motoring}} {{back from the}} route march. His physical tiredness was abated, for he had partaken of a snack and a whisky and soda at the hotel; but mentally {{he was in a}} curious mood. His body felt appeased, his spirit hungry. Tonight he had a yearning, not for his wife's kisses, but for her understanding. He wanted to go to her and say: [...] "I've learnt a lot to-day-found out things I never thought of. Life's a wonderful thing, Kate, a thing one can't live all to oneself; a thing one shares with everybody, so that when another suffers, one suffers too. It's come to me that what one has doesn't matter a bit--it's what one does, and how one sympathises with other people. It came to me in the most extraordinary vivid way, when I was on that jury, watching that poor little rat of a soldier in his trap; it's the first time I've ever felt--the--the spirit of Christ, you know. It's a wonderful thing, Kate--wonderful! We haven't been close--really close, you and I, so that we each understand what the other is feeling. It's all in that, you know; understanding--sympathy--it's priceless. When I saw that poor little devil taken down and sent back to his regiment to begin his sorrows all over again--wanting his wife, thinking and thinking of her just as you know I would be thinking and wanting you, I felt what an awful outside sort of life we lead, never telling each other what we really think and feel, never being really close. I daresay that little chap and his wife keep nothing from each other--live each other's lives. That's what <b>we</b> <b>ought</b> <b>to</b> do. Let's <b>get</b> <b>to</b> feeling that what really matters is--understanding and loving, and not only just saying it as we all do, those fellows on the jury, and even that poor devil of a judge--what an awful life judging one's fellow-creatures.|$|R
