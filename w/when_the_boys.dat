5|$|When King was a child, he befriended a {{white boy}} whose father owned a {{business}} near his family's home. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> were six, they started school: King had {{to attend a}} school for African Americans and the other boy went to one for whites (public schools were among the facilities segregated by state law). King lost his friend because the child's father no longer wanted the boys to play together.|$|E
5|$|Two {{accounts}} exist {{regarding the}} adoption of Rakotomavo, whom Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana designated to rule after him as King Andriambelomasina. According to the first version, Rakotomavo and Mandriamohara were sons of Rangorimanana. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana sent messengers to Ranorimanana to bring the boys to him with the instructions {{to take note of}} which child stood closer to the central pillar (andry, symbolic of strength) of their mother's house. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> entered the house, Rakotomavo stood closer to the pillar. The children's relatives refused to allow the messengers to take the children, so the king sent them back with rice, milk, honey and other goods and successfully lured the boys away.|$|E
5|$|Rex Ryan and his fraternal twin, Rob, {{were born}} in Ardmore, Oklahoma, on December 13, 1962, to Doris and Buddy Ryan. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> were aged two, their parents {{amicably}} divorced. Following the divorce, their mother attended the University of Chicago to earn her doctorate. Rex, Rob, and their older brother Jim moved with her to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where she secured an administrative position at the University of Toronto. During {{the course of his}} upbringing, Rex wanted to {{follow in the footsteps of}} his father, a defensive pioneer in the NFL known for developing the 46 defense, and by the age of six, Rex and Rob knew they wanted to pursue coaching careers.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} a school in Faversham since the 12th century. Archival {{evidence}} has shown this had become a grammar school by 1420. In 1526, John Cole, chaplain to Henry VII and Henry VIII and Warden of All Souls College, Oxford, established a new grammar school on the estate of Ewell Farm. The property fell into disuse after {{the dissolution of the}} abbey, and a replacement grammar school was not established until 1587. The Wreights School, a commercial school, was founded in 1856, while a corresponding girls' school, The Gibbs School was established in 1883. The two boys' schools were amalgamated in 1920, forming Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School. The current school dates from 1967, <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> and girls schools were merged, forming the first co-educational grammar school in Kent.|$|E
5|$|Art Farmer {{was born}} {{an hour before}} his twin brother, on August 21, 1928, in Council Bluffs, Iowa, {{reportedly}} at 2201 Fourth Avenue. Their parents, James Arthur Farmer and Hazel Stewart Farmer, divorced <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> were four, and their steelworker father {{was killed in a}} work accident not long after this. Art moved with his grandfather, grandmother, mother, brother and sister to Phoenix, Arizona when he was still four. He started to play the piano while in elementary school, then moved on to bass tuba and violin before settling on cornet and then trumpet at the age of thirteen. His family was musical: most of them played as a hobby, and one was a professional trombonist. Art's grandfather was a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. This influenced Farmer's first choice of instrument, as his mother played piano for the church choir. The bass tuba was for use in a marching band and was Farmer's instrument for a year, until a cornet became available. Phoenix schools were segregated, and no one at Farmer's school could provide useful music lessons. He taught himself to read music and practiced his new main instrument, the trumpet.|$|E
5|$|He {{is always}} there, he knows everything. He is infallible but always failing. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> rescue him, he is {{typically}} emaciated, dehydrated, semi-conscious, delirious; they must succor him with candy bars and water. He {{can take on}} any shape, but reveals his identity within moments of doing so. He never discusses a case except the one he's working on in a given novel, so that his legendary close-mouthedness turns to garrulousness when a Hardy Boys novel begins, which is of course {{the only time we}} ever get to see him. All the same, he only discusses the case in enough detail to mislead his sons and put them in mortal danger. He has systems of information and data-gathering that put the FBI to shame, yet he is always losing his case notes, his ciphers, his microfilm, or some other valuable clue, usually by leaving it in his extra pair of pants, meaning that the Boys have to drive to Canada or Florida or somewhere to retrieve it. I suppose he isn't mysterious at all; he simply embodies what many think of their own fathers: utterly powerful, contemptibly inept.|$|E

5|$|<b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> regain consciousness, {{they are}} {{backstage}} at the Televised Jonas Brothers' 3D concert spectacular at Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Mickey interrogates them and eventually threatens {{them with a}} chainsaw, refusing to believe they are not working for another company. As Mickey once again rants about his true intentions, this time insulting the Jonas Brothers' fans and Christians, Kyle stealthily turns {{on one of the}} microphones and Cartman raises the curtain, broadcasting Mickey's rant to both the concert-goers and the national television audience. When Mickey realizes that the curtains are raised, the crowd turns on Mickey and the Jonas Brothers leave the stage in a huff. An enraged Mickey grows to an enormous size and begins blowing fire and destroying most of Denver. Tammy and Kenny remove their purity rings, and Tammy suggests they go to T.G.I. Friday's, much to Kenny's excitement. The show immediately cuts to Kenny's funeral, where the audience learns that he contracted syphilis after receiving a blowjob from his girlfriend Tammy Warner and died as a result.|$|E

These were <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>Boys</b> Meet the Girls (1965), starring Connie Francis, where Liberace essentially played himself. He received kudos for his brief appearance as a casket salesman in The Loved One (1966), based on Evelyn Waugh's satire of the funeral business and movie industry in Southern California.|$|E
25|$|Barone patriarch Frank is a fiery proletarian {{prone to}} insults and merciless put downs {{directed}} at {{any and all}} targets. Largely an absentee father <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> were growing up, Frank buries his feelings and rarely gives in to sentiment. As the series progresses, however, several episodes demonstrate that the senior Barone loves his family immensely. Unlike everyone else, Frank has no problem comically criticizing Marie and often comes to Debra's defense following Marie's comments.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{benefits}} {{being a member of}} the school's JTC and Combined Cadet Force was that Derby School pupils were allowed to undertake Cert.'A' training in all military matters and in Derby this meant that final exams were held at The Barracks at Sinfin in Derby, the home of the Sherwood Foresters Regiment. Passing out with a Cert.'A' meant that <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> were later called up to undertake their National Service they were one step ahead of the majority of young men.|$|E

His father Quincy Senior obtained a divorce and remarried. Jones's stepmother, Elvera, had three children of her own: Waymond, who became {{a friend of the}} young Quincy; Theresa; and Katherine. Elvera and Quincy Senior had three more children together through 1950, after they had moved to the Northwest: Jeanette; Margie; and Richard, the last of whom subsequently became a judge in Seattle, making a total of eight in the family.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{thousands}} of boys {{were employed in}} glass making industries. Glass making was a dangerous and tough job especially without the current technologies. The process of making glass includes intense heat to melt glass (3133°F). <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> are at work, {{they are exposed to}} this heat. This could cause eye trouble, lung ailments, heat exhaustion, cut, and burns. Since workers were paid by the piece, they had to work productively for hours without a break. Since furnaces had to be constantly burning, there were night shifts from 5:00pm to 3:00am. Many factory owners preferred boys under 16 years of age.|$|E
25|$|For the {{original}} series, the specific {{ages of the}} investigators were never revealed, but contextual information indicates that they were likely 13 or 14 years old. They were not old enough {{to drive a car}} legally, but were said to be just a few years younger than their nemesis Skinny Norris, who had a driver's license from a state where the required age for a license was younger. On one occasion it was mentioned that Pete was part of the high-school wrestling team. In the later Crimebusters series, it was stated once that the Three Investigators team was initiated <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> were 13.|$|E

25|$|Another version tells {{that two}} Sioux boys wandered {{far from their}} village when Mato the bear, a huge {{creature}} that had claws the size of tipi poles, spotted them, and wanted to eat them for breakfast. He was almost upon them <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> prayed to Wakan Tanka the Creator to help them. They rose up on a huge rock, while Mato {{tried to get up}} from every side, leaving huge scratch marks as he did. Finally, he sauntered off, disappointed and discouraged. The bear came to rest east of the Black Hills at what is now Bear Butte. Wanblee, the eagle, helped the boys off the rock and back to their village. A painting depicting this legend by artist Herbert A. Collins hangs over the fireplace in the visitor's center at Devils Tower.|$|E
25|$|The {{school now}} has six day houses – Holden, Rigaud, Sherrington, School, Broke and Felaw – into which all pupils are {{filtered}} from year 9/Upper 6th Form onwards, {{and a single}} large boarding house - Westwood. Those with relatives who attended the school are generally expected {{to be placed in}} the same house. There is a good deal of competition between the houses and every year, the houses compete for the Ganzoni Cup (house cup), which is won by gaining points from winning inter-house events. These include most sports as well as others such as debating and art. The final and most important event is Sports Day, in the Summer Term, on which the athletics competitions take place. Felaw has won more times than any other house, with Rigaud in second place; it is believed that School has not won {{since the days of the}} reign of Queen Victoria. However, School is the oldest house and dates from the days <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> lived and were taught in one house (called School House). It later became the boarding house which occupied a part of the main building on Henley Road.|$|E
