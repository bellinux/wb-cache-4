50|$|In the {{tradition}} of the Western Churches (Catholic Church, Anglican, Lutheran, and Western Rite Orthodoxy), the feast is moved if necessary to prevent it from falling during Holy <b>Week</b> <b>or</b> Easter <b>Week</b> <b>or</b> on a Sunday on the liturgical calendars. To avoid a Sunday before Holy Week, the next day (26 March) would be observed instead. In years such as 2016 when 25 March fell within Holy <b>Week</b> <b>or</b> Easter <b>Week,</b> the Annunciation is moved to the Monday after the Octave of Easter, i.e., the Monday after the Second Sunday of Easter.|$|R
5|$|Final {{outcomes}} {{for people with}} SCSFLS remain poorly studied. Symptoms may resolve {{in as little as}} two <b>weeks,</b> <b>or</b> persist for months. Less commonly, patients may suffer from unremitting symptoms for many years. People with chronic SCSFLS may be disabled and unable to work. Recurrent CSF leak at an alternate site after recent repair is common.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{support the}} safety of antivenom, with around a 5% chance of an acute reaction, 1–2% of {{anaphylaxis}} and 10% chance of a delayed reaction due to serum sickness. Nevertheless, {{it is recommended that}} an injection of adrenaline be ready and available in case it is needed to treat a severe anaphylactic reaction, and also that the antivenom from the vial be administered diluted in a 100 ml bag of intravenous solution for infusion over 30 minutes. While it is rare that patients report symptoms of envenomation lasting <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months following a bite, there are case reports from the 1990s in which antivenom was reported to be effective in the relief of chronic symptoms when administered <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months after a bite, however, {{in the vast majority of}} cases, it is administered within 24 hours.|$|E

The process would be repeated {{over the course of}} days, <b>weeks,</b> <b>or</b> months, depending on the weather and the progress of the paintings until they were completed. As the seasons changed the process was renewed.|$|E

5|$|At least 30% of TBI are not {{discovered}} at first; this number {{may be as}} high as 50%. In about 10% of cases, TBI has no specific signs either clinically or on chest radiography, and its detection may be further complicated by concurrent injuries, since TBI tends to occur after high-energy accidents. <b>Weeks</b> <b>or</b> months may go by before the injury is diagnosed, even though the injury is better known {{than it was in the}} past.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the series started {{broadcasting}} on ATV in September 1967, principal photography had been completed for the first 20 episodes. In general, turnaround for completing all the puppet shots for each episode was two <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> 11 working days. It was originally predicted that shooting would be wrapped within eight months, but filming overran until late October due {{to the demands of}} the Thunderbird 6 shoot. While production on the next Supermarionation series, , began in November it was not until early 1968 that the last episodes of Captain Scarlet were edited and completed for broadcast.|$|E
5|$|Closely related matrilines form loose aggregations called pods, usually {{consisting}} {{of one to}} four matrilines. Unlike matrilines, pods may separate for <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months at a time. DNA testing indicates resident males nearly always mate with females from other pods. Clans, {{the next level of}} resident social structure, are composed of pods with similar dialects, and common but older maternal heritage. Clan ranges overlap, mingling pods from different clans. The final association layer, perhaps more arbitrarily defined than the familial groupings, is called the community, and is defined as a set of clans that regularly commingle. Clans within a community do not share vocal patterns.|$|E

5|$|Elsewhere in the Mediterranean are pumice {{deposits}} {{that could}} have been caused by the Thera eruption. Ash layers in cores drilled from the seabed and from lakes in Turkey, however, show that the heaviest ashfall was towards the east and northeast of Santorini. The ash found on Crete is now known to have been from a precursory phase of the eruption, some <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months before the main eruptive phases, and it would have had little impact on the island. Santorini ash deposits were at one time claimed to have been found in the Nile delta, but this is now known to be a misidentification.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} (LBP) {{is a common}} {{disorder}} involving the muscles, nerves, and bones of the back. Pain can vary from a dull constant ache to a sudden sharp feeling. Low back pain may be classified by duration as acute (pain lasting less than 6 weeks), sub-chronic (6 to 12 <b>weeks),</b> <b>or</b> chronic (more than 12 weeks). The condition may be further classified by the underlying cause as either mechanical, non-mechanical, or referred pain. The symptoms of low back pain usually improve {{within a few weeks}} from the time they start, with 40-90% of people completely better by six weeks.|$|E
5|$|Males {{without them}} {{are known as}} unflanged males in {{contrast}} to the more developed flanged males. The transformation from unflanged to flanged can occur very quickly. Unflanged and flanged males have two different mating strategies. Flanged males attract oestrous females with their characteristic long calls. Those calls may also suppress development in younger males. Unflanged males wander widely in search of oestrous females and upon finding one, will force copulation on her. While both strategies are successful, females prefer to mate with flanged males and seek their company for protection against unflanged males. Resident males may form consortships with females that can last days, <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months after copulation.|$|E

5|$|Muscle biopsy can {{be useful}} if an episode of {{rhabdomyolysis}} {{is thought to be}} the result of an underlying muscle disorder. A biopsy sample taken during an episode is often uninformative, as it will show only evidence of cell death or may appear normal. Taking the sample is therefore delayed for several <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months. The histopathological appearance on the biopsy indicates the nature of the underlying disorder. For instance, mitochondrial diseases are characterized by ragged red fibers. Biopsy sites may be identified by medical imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging, as the muscles may not be uniformly affected.|$|E
5|$|Peak {{benefits}} achieved for generalized {{anxiety disorder}} (GAD) may take up to a week. Tolerance to the anxiolytic and antipanic effects is controversial, with only some authoritative sources supporting the development of tolerance; tolerance will, however, develop to the sedative and hypnotic effects {{within a couple of}} days. Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing treatment abruptly following a few <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. Other risks include increased rates of suicide, possibly due to disinhibition.|$|E
5|$|Permanent brachytherapy, {{also known}} as seed implantation, {{involves}} placing small LDR radioactive seeds or pellets (about {{the size of a}} grain of rice) in the tumour or treatment site and leaving them there permanently to gradually decay. Over a period of <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months, the level of radiation emitted by the sources will decline to almost zero. The inactive seeds then remain in the treatment site with no lasting effect. Permanent brachytherapy is most commonly used in the treatment of prostate cancer.|$|E

5|$|The {{acute phase}} lasts {{for the first}} few <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months of infection. It usually occurs unnoticed because it is symptom-free or {{exhibits}} only mild symptoms that are not unique to Chagas disease. These can include fever, fatigue, body aches, muscle pain, headache, rash, loss of appetite, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. The signs on physical examination can include mild enlargement of the liver or spleen, swollen glands, and local swelling (a chagoma) where the parasite entered the body.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of AML {{are caused by}} replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells, which causes a drop in red blood cells, platelets, and normal white blood cells. These symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, easy bruising and bleeding, and increased risk of infection. Several risk factors and chromosomal abnormalities have been identified, but the specific cause is not clear. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within <b>weeks</b> <b>or</b> months if left untreated.|$|E
