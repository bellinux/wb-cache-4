5|$|Jerry {{knows what}} the {{situation}} is. I think he's done very well for us, considering we plucked him out of non-league football at Yeovil. But he is aware that I {{have been looking for}} a right-back and I will continue looking for one. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate what Jerry has done for me since I signed him three-and-a-half years ago. There isn't a more reliable player at the club than Jerry Gill. He captains my reserve team, his fitness is of a very high standard and he has endless enthusiasm. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> him in the first team, he never lets me down. I value Jerry's professionalism and for as long as I remain manager of Birmingham, {{there will always be a}} place for him here.|$|E
25|$|While {{continuing}} his writing and consulting on foreign affairs, Masuzoe relocated from Tokyo to Kitakyushu in the 1990s {{to take care}} of his aging mother, who began to show signs of deteriorating mental health. In 1998, he published a book entitled <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>Put</b> a Diaper on My Mother, which details his experience caring for his mother and the obstacles imposed by the Japanese welfare system. The book sold 100,000 copies, more than any of his previous political works, and propelled Masuzoe into the national spotlight as an authority on the aging society in Japan.|$|E
500|$|Considering what to write, Carrier {{thought of}} his own childhood. He stated in an {{interview}} that he began thinking of [...] "when was it that I felt I was really myself? And I remember it was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> on my skates and my Eaton catalogues on my legs, and I stood up, and I was taller than my mom, and I had a stick in my hands, so I was stronger than my brother, and I felt that I was little me. So I started to write about that and it turned into the Hockey Sweater story." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{working at}} Wanamaker's Department Store in 1919, Cagney learned, from a {{colleague}} {{who had seen}} him dance, of {{a role in the}} upcoming production Every Sailor. A wartime play in which the chorus was made up of servicemen dressed as women, it was originally titled Every Woman. Cagney auditioned for the role of a chorus girl, despite considering it a waste of time; he knew only one dance step, the complicated Peabody, but he knew it perfectly. This was enough to convince the producers that he could dance, and he copied the other dancers' moves while waiting to go on. He did not find it odd to play a woman, nor was he embarrassed. He later recalled how he was able to shed his own natural shy persona when he stepped onto the stage: [...] "For there I am not myself. I am not that fellow, Jim Cagney, at all. I certainly lost all consciousness of him <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> on skirts, wig, paint, powder, feathers and spangles." ...|$|E
500|$|.....as I {{began to}} research, even I, {{as someone who}} had been paying {{attention}} {{to some of these}} sorts of things {{for a long time and}} was open to alternative explanations, even I was fairly astonished <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> it together, basically by going county by county and finding the criminal arrest records and the jail records in county after county after county from this period of time and seeing that if there had been crime waves, there had to have been records of crimes and people being arrested for crimes. And in reality, it's just not there."There's no evidence that that ever happened. In fact, it's the opposite. The crime waves that occurred by and large were the aftermath of the war and whites coming back from fighting in the Civil War and settling scores with people and all sorts of renegade activity that didn't involve black people at all, but they were blamed for it, and that was then used as a kind of ruse for why these incredibly brutal new legal measures then began to be put in place." ...|$|E
2500|$|Political {{messages}} were also occasionally {{displayed in the}} backgrounds of scenes, as graffiti or fluttering newspapers displaying politically charged headlines which alluded to social problems, such as white collar crime, and homelessness. For his part, Norm Breyfogle believed that his role in producing the comic was merely that of artist, and so felt that his contribution to the comic's themes were minimal. Of them he expressed, [...] "(The series) was quite obviously subversive. But as an artist I was just drawing Alan’s stories. I wouldn’t say that I was being particularly subversive, although I was a bit <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> graffiti on the walls in the backgrounds.|$|E

2500|$|The Whitlams {{recorded}} {{their third}} album, Eternal Nightcap, with Freedman and Taylor co-producing. Freedman [...] "chose musicians to fit each song, {{rather than have}} the same band through the whole album." [...] The album was recorded on an extremely limited budget of $18,000. In a later interview Freedman reflects [...] "The band became a revolving door because I had no money to pay anyone. I actually made the album, Eternal Nightcap, during that most difficult period, that was a really tough year in which to keep my focus and keep my head up, but it ended in September 1997 <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> the record out and it just started selling itself." [...] Jonathan Lewis of AllMusic described it as being [...] " [...] full of gentle, well-crafted, piano-driven pop songs." [...] Singles from the album include [...] "You Sound Like Louis Burdett" [...] (May 1997), [...] "Melbourne" [...] (January 1998) and [...] "No Aphrodisiac" [...] (February).|$|E
2500|$|Also at Cannes, McKellen {{was quoted}} as saying [...] "While I was reading the book I {{believed}} it entirely. Clever Dan Brown twisted my mind convincingly. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> it down I thought, 'What a load of [...] potential codswallop." [...] During a May 17, 2006 interview on The Today Show with the Da Vinci Code cast and director, Matt Lauer posed a question to the group about how they would have felt if the film had borne a prominent disclaimer that it is a work of fiction, as some religious groups wanted. (Some high-ranking Vatican cabinet members had called for a boycott of the film.) McKellen responded, [...] "I've often thought the Bible should have a disclaimer in the front saying 'This is fiction.' I mean, walking on water? It takes[...] [...] an act of faith. And I have faith in this movie—not that it's true, not that it's factual, but that it's a jolly good story." [...] He continued, [...] "And I think audiences are clever enough and bright enough to separate out fact and fiction, and discuss the thing when they've seen it." ...|$|E
