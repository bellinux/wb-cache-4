5|$|Adherents of Heathenry can {{be found}} in Europe, North America, and Australasia. They are mostly found in those areas with a Germanic {{cultural}} inheritance, although they are present in several other regions. In 2007, the religious studies scholar Graham Harvey stated {{that it was impossible to}} develop a precise figure for the number of Heathens across the world. A self-selected census in 2013 found 16,700 members in 98 countries, the bulk of whom lived in the United States. In 2016, Schnurbein stated that there were probably no more than 20,000 Heathens globally. She noted that, <b>while</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> some exceptions, most Heathen groups were 60–70% male in their composition.|$|E
5|$|After World War II, {{there was}} only general {{aviation}} at Værnes, organized by two clubs, Værnes flyklubb and NTH flyklubb. From 1 August 1946 to 31 July 1947, there were 1,221 take-offs from Værnes, mostly during the summer. During parts of 1946 and 1947, the airport {{was used as a}} pasture for sheep. The first scheduled service was introduced with a Douglas DC-3 operated to Oslo by DNL during the winter of 19467–48. <b>While</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> initially many customers, the lack of sufficient deicing caused low regularity and fewer customers through the season.

On November 8, 1961, at 21:24 Eastern Time Zone (EST), the aircraft crashed as it attempted {{to land at}} Byrd Field, near Richmond, Virginia. <b>While</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no apparent impact-related injuries, all seventy-four passengers and three crew members {{died as a result}} of carbon monoxide asphyxiation in the ensuing fire and smoke.

5|$|In 1888, Captain Lyman Hall was {{appointed}} Georgia Tech's first mathematics professor (and consequently {{head of the}} school's mathematics department). He had a solid background in engineering due to his time at West Point and often incorporated surveying and other engineering applications into his coursework. He had an energetic personality and quickly assumed a leadership position among the faculty. At the first faculty meeting on October 5, 1888, he was elected secretary. On June 25, 1895, Professor Hall was invited to speak to Georgia Tech's board about the school's needs. <b>While</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no recorded minutes, subsequent board actions suggest that he recommended the construction of on-campus dormitories to reduce disciplinary problems, and a more proactive recruitment of students.|$|E

5|$|The Edwin H. Morris & Company {{obtained}} a copyright to Roman's version in 1931; that company was later acquired by Paul McCartney's holding company, MPL Communications in 1976.

In 1953, Greenblatt sold the copyright for the new version to Georgia Tech for one dollar. There was some controversy when MPL Communications acquired the old copyright; a law firm commissioned by Georgia Tech in 1984, Newton, Hopkins & Ormsby, concluded that <b>while</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> copyrighted versions of the song, the version used by the school was not copyrighted and falls in the public domain.|$|E

5|$|The {{station at}} Brattøra has had four names, {{following}} the name {{changes of the}} city.

The station at Brattøra is physically divided in two parts by the bridge over Ravnkloa. From 1884, the western part was officially called Throndhjem V and the eastern part Throndhjem Ø. The freight station for the Røros Line was located at Throndhjem V, while the passenger station for both lines was located at Throndhjem Ø, just like today. <b>While</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> two stations in 1882–84, they were 'probably' referred to as Brattøra and Kalvskinnet.|$|E
5|$|There {{was similar}} {{nationwide}} {{concern over the}} United States' involvement in the Cambodian Civil War, resulting in the Kent State shootings, which in turn caused about 450 colleges to suspend classes. In Georgia, the student response was largely restrained. Several hundred students at the University of Georgia marched on the home of president Frederick Corbet Davison demanding that the school be closed; consequently, all schools in the University System of Georgia were closed on May 8 and 9. <b>While</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> no protests at Tech, the students were still concerned over the events at Kent State; on May 8, four hundred students and faculty filled Bertha Square for a student-organized memorial, after which the students left quietly.|$|E
5|$|This growing {{coalition}} {{expanded the}} potential enemies that Rome might face, and moved Rome closer to confrontation with major powers.
