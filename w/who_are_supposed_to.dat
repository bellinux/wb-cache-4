5|$|Hinduism is {{the major}} {{religion}} with about 80% of the population adhering to it. About 11% of the population follow Islam and 8% follow Christianity. Evidence of prehistoric religion in South India comes from scattered Mesolithic rock paintings depicting dances and rituals in Stone Age sites such as the Kupgal petroglyphs of eastern Karnataka. Hinduism, often regarded as the oldest religion in the world, traces its roots to prehistoric times in India. The main spiritual traditions of South India include both Shaivite and Vaishnavite branches of Hinduism, although Buddhist and Jain philosophies had been influential several centuries earlier. Ayyavazhi is spread significantly across the southern parts of South India. Islam was introduced to South India in the early 7th century by Arab traders in Malabar Coast of Kerala and spread during the rule of Deccan Sultanates from 17th to 18th century and the Muslims in Kerala of Arab descent are called Jonaka Mappila. Christianity was introduced to South India by Thomas the Apostle, who visited Muziris in Kerala in 52 CE and baptised Kerala's Jewish settlements. Kerala {{is also home to}} one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> have arrived in the Malabar coast during the reign of King Solomon.|$|E
25|$|Other sacred {{mountains}} {{had different}} traditions, such as segregating the sexes by season, allowing women to climb at some times and men to climb at others. It {{is believed that}} the reason for this ban was to remove thoughts of temptation from the Yamabushi monks <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> practice the strict self-denial of a hermit in isolated mountain. Eventually the bans came to be called Nyonin Kekkai (女人結界) and toward women only.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, {{human rights}} {{violations}} tend to be common during insurgencies and counterinsurgency efforts. Western powers conducting multiple foreign internal defense (FID) operations are coming under increasing pressure to provide human rights and Geneva Conventions training to host nation personnel, although the results vary. Part of the challenge arrives when host nation personnel gets involved in combat without FID advisers, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> monitor their conduct and prevent abuses. The 1980-1992 Salvadoran Civil War, where {{human rights violations}} were documented on both sides, can be cited as an example.|$|E

25|$|Orlando is the Christian knight {{known in}} French (and {{subsequently}} English) as Roland. The action takes place {{against the background}} of the war between Charlemagne's Christian paladins and the Saracen army that has invaded Europe and is attempting to overthrow the Christian empire. The poem is about war and love and the romantic ideal of chivalry. It mixes realism and fantasy, humor and tragedy. The stage is the entire world, plus a trip to the moon. The large cast of characters features Christians and Saracens, soldiers and sorcerers, and fantastic creatures including a gigantic sea monster called the orc and a flying horse called the hippogriff. Many themes are interwoven in its complicated episodic structure, but the most important are the paladin Orlando's unrequited love for the pagan princess Angelica, which drives him mad; the love between the female Christian warrior Bradamante and the Saracen Ruggiero, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be the ancestors of Ariosto's patrons, the d'Este family of Ferrara; and the war between Christian and Infidel.|$|E

Even though Fielding fails to explain what the existence of ghosts means, the image of the ghost can serve as a metaphor for Fielding's expectation of women <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be publicly virtuous.

500|$|In late 2009, {{a popular}} investigative {{television}} show on China Central Television aired a critical story on Bo's anti-crime drive, expressing {{concern over the}} apparent disregard for legal due process. In response, Bo utilized his connections to have the show's host temporarily banned from the airwaves, and its producer moved to another program. Others who opposed Bo's initiatives were also met with retribution. Li Zhuang, a defense lawyer from Beijing, was sentenced to {{two and a half}} years in prison (later reduced to 18 months) in 2009 for attempting to defend one of the high-profile targets of Bo's crackdown. Cheng Li, a scholar at the Brookings Institution, said that [...] "Nobody really trusts : a lot of people are scared of him, including several princelings <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be his power base." ...|$|E

500|$|Holmes drew {{inspiration}} from Inuit beliefs and the Native American languages which are spoken in the area which the bears live. Holmes developed Ujuark's shape-shifting powers after reading up on shamans, <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be able to transform into other animals. Holmes liked the idea and decided {{to have one of}} the bears have the same ability, which allowed him to [...] "infiltrate a human community without them guessing the truth." [...] Later, Holmes [...] "needed to establish what sort of beliefs each bear would have," [...] so after finding that bears are closely linked to their environment just like Native Americans, Holmes centered her research around the Natives. The names of the bears are from Native American languages; Lusa means midnight or black in Choctaw, while Kallik means lightning in Inuktitut, Silaluk means storm in Inuktitut, Taqqiq means moon, Toklo means two in Chicksaw, and Ujurak means rock.|$|E
500|$|Hubbard's {{supporters}} {{soon began}} to have doubts about Dianetics. Winter became disillusioned and wrote {{that he had never}} seen a single convincing Clear: [...] "I have seen some individuals <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> have been 'clear,' but their behavior does not conform to the definition of the state. Moreover, an individual supposed to have been 'clear' has undergone a relapse into conduct which suggests an incipient psychosis." [...] He also deplored the Foundation's omission of any serious scientific research. Dianetics lost public credibility in August 1950 when a presentation by Hubbard before an audience of 6,000 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles failed disastrously. He introduced a Clear named Sonya Bianca and told the audience {{that as a result of}} undergoing Dianetic therapy she now possessed perfect recall. However, Gardner writes, [...] "in the demonstration that followed, she failed to remember a single formula in physics (the subject in which she was majoring) or the color of Hubbard's tie when his back was turned. At this point, a large part of the audience got up and left." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{production}} {{was met with}} negative attention by film critics. A reviewer in the The Moving Picture News wrote, [...] "There isn't {{a lot to the}} story, but the acting is of the class which still finds favor with the public. The pictures taken in Chinatown do not go quite far enough in depicting East Side conditions; the photography of these particular scenes is not the ideal of Thanhouser productions..." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was more moderate in its criticism by identifying specific faults with the portrayal, but found that the story to be good and the parts well-acted. The Morning Telegraph offered similar criticism, [...] "The story of this picture is fairly good, but the details are wrong. In the first place, the producers evidently never were in a sweatshop, or else they would not have representing a sweatshop a store like a custom tailor shop, doing a thriving business. The people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be Hebrews hardly resemble them. The next objection is when the settlement worker falls into a faint, the girl is very slow in picking him up. The story tells of a poor immigrant Hebrew girl who {{falls in love with a}} settlement worker, who returns her affection, which finally results in their marriage." [...] Some advertisements would bill the production as seeing the other side of New York City life.|$|E

GameSpy called his new design in Resident Evil 5 a cross between Colin Farrell and Hugh Jackman" [...] in particular, and became a source of controversy and was often ridiculed. GameSpot gave Chris the special award for [...] "character most likely to fail a performance-enhancing drug test" [...] in the Dubious Honors awards in 2009, adding that [...] "the man is clearly a walking pharmacy". Including him on its list of [...] "ten game heroes who fail at the simple stuff" [...] for his inability to shoot while moving in RE5, GameDaily recommended he [...] "spend {{a little more time}} on the shooting range and a little less time pumping iron in front of a mirror". Joystiq commented that during The Umbrella Chronicles Chris possibly started his [...] "steroid abuse", a suggestion also made by IGN. In 2011, BeefJack featured Chris among the five game characters <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be sexy but turned out awkward, as [...] "he looks like the runner-up in a Popeye lookalike contest". On the other hand, when GamesRadar compared his Code Veronica and RE5 designs while trying to evaluate which would fit better for a zombie apocalypse, they found the latter provided a better chance to survive to a zombie attack. It also judged Chris from the original game as [...] "horribly ill-prepared".|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from December 10, 1910. It states: [...] "Rip Van Winkle, although a loving father to his little girl Meenie and a hail-fellow-well-met {{with all of his}} fellow townsmen, is being constantly scolded by his wife for leading an idle and profitless existence. Rip is also fond of the bottle and spends a greater part of his time and money at the village tavern. Catching him entering the house late one night after a day's carousing, his wife Gretchen becomes thoroughly angry with him and drives him from the house. In the face of a terrible storm with only his dog Schneider and his faithful rifle to protect him, Rip wanders toward the mountains. Here he comes across a band of gnomes <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be the spirits of Heinrich Hudson [...] and his merry men who disappeared near the Catskill Mountains hundreds of years before, and had never been heard of since. The gnomes give Rip some magic schnapps to drink, and under its influence he goes to sleep for 20 years. When he awakes, he is an old man and in ragged clothes. His dog is dead, and his rifle has rusted away. He makes his way as best he can back to the village, and his own home. But there no one knows him. He finds his wife married to another man, his daughter grown to womanhood, and most of his old friends dead and gone. Rip, however, finally manages to prove his identity, and also to lay claim to his property, which has greatly increased in value during his sleep, in which he is just in time to save from being unlawfully confiscated by his old-time enemy. Happily reunited to his family, Rip looks forward to his declining years with a spirit born of peace and solace." ...|$|E

These days, some of the Nottos make dhaks. A dhak made of mango wood and goat skin sells for around Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,500, leaving a profit of only Rs 50. Some have taken to other professions.|$|E
2500|$|The {{board of}} {{directors}} is the governing body of the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority. Its membership usually consists of private citizens <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> represent the public interest and {{may or may not}} include exofficio political officeholders (typically the Secretary of Economic Development and Commerce). This inconsistency happens as the board's structure changes whenever a political party gains power, usually every four or eight years. [...] When both the governor and the legislature of Puerto Rico belong to the same party, one of the earliest laws amended by the legislature is the one governing PREPA in order to change its board's composition. Once a new board is settled in, one of its first resolutions is to appoint a new executive director. These frequent changes effectively make the authority a partisan tool rather than a mere electric utility and, consequently, change the vision, strategy, and plans of the authority every four or eight years according to the political party in power.|$|E

The camp, which lasted for four days, involved children from Bethlehem, Ramallah, East Jerusalem, Tulkarem, Jericho, and Jenin. The Israeli children involved were mostly those who came from severe poverty and violent backgrounds. Joint-organizer Osnat Youdkevitch remarked that, [...] "Our message is that of dignity for all human beings.

2500|$|The {{series has}} been noted for its {{relatively}} sympathetic portrayal of the aristocratic family, and the class-based society of early 20thcentury Britain. This has led to criticism from the political left and praise from the right. James Fenton wrote in The New York Review of Books [...] "it is noticeable that the aristocrats in the series, even the ones <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> be the most ridiculous, never lapse into the most offensive kind of upper-class drawl one would expect of them. Great care has been taken to keep them pleasant and approachable, even when the things they say are sometimes shown to be class-bound and unfeeling." [...] Jerry Bowyer argued in Forbes that the sympathy for aristocracy is over-stated, and that the show is simply more balanced than most period dramas, which he believes have {{had a tendency to}} demonise or ridicule upper class characters. He wrote that Downton Abbey shows [...] "there is no inherent need for good TV to be left of center. Stories sympathetic to virtue, preservation of property and admiration of nobility and of wealth can be told beautifully and to wide audiences." ...|$|E
