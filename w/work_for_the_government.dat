5|$|Saitō then {{travels to}} Kyoto to fight Shishio under {{government}} orders. Along with Kenshin and Sanosuke, he assaults Shishio's battleship, the Purgatory. Accepting Shishio's challenge {{to fight on}} Mount Hiei, Saitō kills Uonuma Usui, one of the Ten Swords, and later ambushes Shishio, almost, but failing to kill him as Shishio had been wearing a hachigane (iron headband). Months later, Saitō is sent to arrest Yukishiro Enishi and he helps Kenshin fight against The Six Comrades, defeating Yatsume Mumyōi. He also fights against {{the first of the}} four Sū-shin guards of Woo Heishin, Enishi's second-in-command, and defeats him. Afterwards, Saitō is transferred to work in another location after rejecting the continuation of his duel with Kenshin. Five {{years after the end of}} series, it is revealed that Saitō continues to <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>government.</b>|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his writing}} career, Joehana wrote independently, unattached to any {{publishing}} house. At the time, Balai Pustaka, a publisher {{operated by the}} Dutch colonial government, was attracting numerous Sundanese-language writers. His biographers Tini Kartini et al. suggest that Joehana rejected his contemporaries' approach, choosing to work independently rather than again <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> which had fired him and would certainly censor his works. This, they write, is shown through the themes common in the stories: where his contemporaries focused on escapist literature and entertainment, Joehana focused on social criticism. However, Ajip Rosidi, a scholar of Sundanese literature, suggests that Joehana's refusal to use formal Sundanese meant that Balai Pustaka would not accept his works.|$|E

5|$|Until the 1906–07 season, {{the players}} were not paid to play hockey, as the team was abiding by the {{principles}} of amateur sports. Ottawa HC had an advantage in attracting top players to its squad. The players could <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>government,</b> and the work allowed the players {{to play for the}} team. Meanwhile, in the United States, the International Hockey League was paying players. In response to this, the ECAHA, while still having several purely amateur teams, started to allow professional players. The top teams could therefore compete for the top players and the gate attractions that they were. The only restriction was that the status of each and every player had to be publicized.|$|E

25|$|Language policy {{remains a}} {{perennial}} issue in New Brunswick society and politics. Recurring debates have arisen {{in regards to}} interpretation of the provincial bilingualism policy, duality (the system of parallel French and English speaking public services), and specifics of implementation. The extent of the provincial policy on bilingualism means that a new row is never far off in the New Brunswick news cycle. The French-speaking community continues to advocate for full funding of French-language public services and fair representation in public sector employment, while some Anglophones (and Francophones) fear that the system of duality is financially inefficient and its extent is not worthwhile, or that the provincial governments targets for bilingualism in public employment are hurting their chances to <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>government,</b> as Anglophones {{are less likely than}} Francophones to be proficient enough in both official languages to use them in employment.|$|E
25|$|The Umayyad {{state is}} remembered as an Arab-centric state, {{being run by}} and {{for the benefit of}} those who were ethnically Arab though Muslim in creed. The non-Arab Muslims resented their {{marginal}} social position and were easily drawn into Abbasid opposition to Umayyad rule. Arabs dominated the bureaucracy and military, and were housed in fortresses separate from the local population outside of Arabia. Even after converting to Islam, non-Arabs or Mawali could not live in these garrison cities. The non-Arabs were not allowed to <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> nor could they hold officer positions in the Umayyad military and they still had to pay the jizya tax for non-Muslims. Non-Muslims under Umayyad rule were subject to these same injunctions. Racial intermarriage between Arabs and non Arabs was rare. When it did occur, it was only allowed between an Arab man and a non-Arab woman while non-Arab men were generally not free to marry Arab women.|$|E
25|$|Although {{until the}} 1960s, many {{indigenous}} communities were considered by scholars to be autonomous and economically isolated, this {{was never the}} case. Economic conditions began forcing many to migrate to work, especially in agriculture for non- indigenous. However, unlike many other migrant workers, most indigenous in Chiapas have remained strongly tied to their home communities. A study {{as early as the}} 1970s showed that 77 percent of heads of household migrated outside of the Chamula municipality as local land did not produce sufficiently to support families. In the 1970s, cuts in the price of corn forced many large landowners to convert their fields into pasture for cattle, displacing many hired laborers as cattle required less work. These agricultural laborers began to <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> on infrastructure projects financed by oil revenue. It is estimated that in the 1980s to 1990s as many as 100,000 indigenous people moved from the mountain areas into cities in Chiapas, with some moving out of the state to Mexico City, Cancún and Villahermosa in search of employment.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from television critics. Jane Boursaw of TV Squad wasn't {{sure what to}} think about [...] "The Bishop Revival", but loved the plotline about Walter's dad being a German spy working for the US government. Alternately, Annalee Newitz of io9 called the episode [...] "surprisingly meh"; while appreciating [...] "all the weird family revelations about the Bishops", she believed the revelations about Walter's father to be [...] "too much" [...] because [...] "we didn't need that extra backstory". Newitz wished Fringe had brought back Olivia's childhood subplot and its ties with Walter and Peter. The A.V. Club columnist Noel Murray was also critical of the episode, explaining [...] "Plotwise, there wasn't much going on in 'The Bishop Revival.'... The FD tracked down a criminal and felled that criminal; that's really it." [...] Murray did however praise the killer's methods and [...] "Aryan aloofness" [...] as [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "delightfully old-school". Like Newitz, Tim Grierson of the magazine New York believed the episode contained [...] "stupid revelations"; for instance, the Nazi connection of Walter's father [...] "just felt like a variation on season one's episodes in which bizarre phenomena could always magically be linked back to Walter's <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>government.</b> Obviously, this info about Peter's grandfather {{was supposed to be}} 'shocking,' showing how the Bishop family's scientific work can so easily be perverted for evil, but by this point it just seems like a very artificial, unnecessary ploy to keep us engaged." ...|$|E

2500|$|In March 1964, a new decree banned Jews from {{traveling}} {{more than}} [...] from their hometowns. Jews {{were not allowed}} to <b>work</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> or banks, could not acquire drivers' licenses, and were banned from purchasing property. Although Jews were prohibited from leaving the country, they were sometimes allowed to travel abroad for commercial or medical reasons. Any Jew granted clearance to leave the country had to leave behind a bond of $300–$1,000 and family members to be used as hostages to ensure they returned. An airport road was paved over the Jewish cemetery in Damascus, and Jewish schools were closed and handed over to Muslims. The Jewish Quarter of Damascus was under constant surveillance by the secret police, who were present at synagogue services, weddings, bar mitzvahs, and other Jewish gatherings. The secret police closely monitored contact between Syrian Jews and foreigners and kept a file on every member of the Jewish community. Jews also had their phones tapped and their mail read by the secret police.|$|E

Alchemists have the ability, with the help of patterns called Transmutation Circles, to create almost anything they desire. However, when they do so, they must provide something of equal value in accordance with the Law of Equivalent Exchange. The only things Alchemists are forbidden from transmuting are humans and gold. There has never been a successful human transmutation; those who attempt it lose a part of their body and the result is a horrific inhuman mass. Attemptees are confronted by , a pantheistic and semi-cerebral God-like being who tauntingly regulates all alchemy use and whose nigh-featureless appearance is relative to the person to whom Truth is conversing with; the series' antagonist, Father, and some other characters, claim and believe that Truth is a personal God who punishes the arrogant, a belief that Edward denies, citing a flaw in Father's interpretation of Truth's works.|$|E
