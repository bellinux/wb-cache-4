5|$|Once {{the track}} was {{reported}} clear of debris, the safety car was withdrawn {{and the race}} restarted on lap five. Jonathan Palmer, commentating alongside Murray Walker for the BBC, remarked how quick Schumacher was, as {{his time in the}} warm-up session on Sunday morning gave rise to speculation {{that he was going to}} make one pit stop and, therefore, race with a heavier car than Senna, who was planning to make two, as was conventional. Martin Brundle had told BBC presenter Steve Rider that McLaren <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> two stops. On the second lap after the restart, with Ayrton Senna leading Michael Schumacher, Senna's car left the road at the Tamburello corner, and after slowing from 190mph (306km/h) to 131mph (211km/h), hit the concrete wall, with debris flying into the path of the other drivers.|$|E

25|$|Ferguson made an {{approach}} for Tottenham winger Darren Anderton, but the player signed {{a new contract}} with the North London club. He then made a bid to sign Dutchman Marc Overmars from Ajax (the European Cup winners), but the player suffered a serious knee injury and was ruled out for months. Media reports suggested that United <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{an approach}} for Juventus and Italy forward Roberto Baggio, but the player remained in his homeland and signed for Milan instead.|$|E
25|$|After {{getting off}} to 2–7 start, the Mavericks {{eventually}} found {{themselves with the}} sixth spot in the Western Conference playoff bracket for 2009 after going 50–32 (ninth consecutive 50+-win season) and about {{three to four weeks}} earlier, weren't even sure if they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the eighth and final spot. But a run of 5–1 in their last six regular season games got them to a game over the Hornets for sixth place. Dirk Nowitzki also entered the postseason with a streak of twenty-five consecutive games of scoring 20 or more points, which was ended in {{the first game of the}} quarterfinals series versus the arch-rival, San Antonio Spurs.|$|E

25|$|Because the tax did not vary, the {{treasury}} could estimate fairly well {{how much they}} <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> in revenue for the year. Prior to Khosrow's tax reforms, taxes were collected based on the yield that the land had produced. This system was changed to one which calculated and averaged taxation based on the water rights for each piece of property. Lands which grew date palms and olive trees used a slightly different method of taxation based {{on the amount of}} producing trees that the land contained. These tax reforms of Khosrow were the stepping stone which enabled subsequent reforms in the bureaucracy and the military to take place.|$|E
25|$|The {{time machine}} went through several {{variations}} during {{production of the}} first film, Back to the Future. In {{the first draft of}} the screenplay, the time machine was a laser device that was housed in a room. At {{the end of the first}} draft the device was attached to a refrigerator and taken to an atomic bomb test site. Director Robert Zemeckis said in an interview that the idea was scrapped because he did not want children to start climbing into refrigerators and getting trapped inside. In the third draft of the film the time machine was a car, as Zemeckis reasoned that if you <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a time machine, you would want it to be mobile. The specific choice of vehicle was a DeLorean DMC-12 for the purposes of it looking like an alien spaceship due to its characteristic gullwing doors (which were inspired by the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL). However, in order to send Marty back to the future, the vehicle had to drive into a nuclear test site. Ultimately this concept was considered too expensive to film, so the power source was changed to lightning.|$|E

500|$|Keaton's casting {{caused a}} {{controversy}} among comic book fans, with 50,000 protest letters sent to Warner Bros. offices. Bob Kane, Sam Hamm and Michael Uslan also heavily questioned the casting. [...] "Obviously {{there was a}} negative response from the comic book people. I think they thought we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it like the 1960s TV series, and make it campy, because they thought of Michael Keaton from Mr. Mom and Night Shift and stuff like that."

500|$|After being {{replaced}} as starter {{for the final}} three playoff games, Roberto Luongo stated {{he would be willing}} to waive his no-trade clause if asked. Following the re-signing of Cory Schneider to a three-year $12 million extension, trade rumors increased. It was later reported that Luongo wanted to be traded and that [...] "it was time to move on." [...] Though as training camp approached, Luongo had not been traded. He indicated that he would have no issues returning to the Canucks. Gillis further stated that although he had received several [...] "strong" [...] offers, the Canucks were not having a [...] "fire sale" [...] for Luongo. Doug MacLean on Sportsnet's Hockey Central reported that a deal was in place to send Luongo to the Toronto Maple Leafs. However, Luongo, believing the Florida Panthers, his preferred destination, <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a deal for him, refused to waive his no trade clause.

500|$|Collaborations include [...] "Matando", [...] "Rociarlos" [...] (also {{featuring}} Hector El Father) and [...] "Baila Así" [...] with Queen's then-husband, Gran Omar; {{a hip-hop}} track, [...] "Quítate Two", with Fat Joe; [...] "Acércate" [...] with Mikey Perfecto, [...] "Tócame" [...] with salsa singer La India and [...] "Vas A Morir" [...] with Puerto Rican duo Getto & Gastam. [...] "Soldados" [...] and [...] "Dee Jay" [...] were co-written with Kasseem Dean and Omar Navarro, respectively. [...] "People thought we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a salsa track", Queen {{said about the}} collaboration with La India, noting that the song was a dancehall track (not salsa or reggaetón). She added that India was [...] "original" [...] and she worked well {{with people who are}} genuine, explaining the other collaborations. According to Navarro and Queen in an 2004 interview on mun2 The Roof, the album was expected to feature a duet with Puerto Rican singer Don Omar. Spin saw Queen's collaboration with Fat Joe as a trend in reggaetón to have American rappers [...] "team up with its stars".|$|E
500|$|Another major {{breakthrough}} was developing the plot twist that Prince Hans would be revealed as the film's true villain only near the end. Hans {{was not even}} in the earliest drafts, then at first was not a villain, and after becoming one, was revealed to be evil much earlier in the plot. Del Vecho said, [...] "We realized [...] was most important [...] if we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the ending so surprising you had to believe at one point that Hans was the answer... he's not the answer, it's Kristoff... f you can get the audience to leap ahead and think they have figured it out you can surprise them by turning it the other way." [...] Lee acknowledged that Hans was written as [...] "sociopathic" [...] and [...] "twisted" [...] throughout the final version. For example, Hans mirrors the behavior of the other characters: [...] "He mirrors [...] and he's goofy with her... he Duke [...] is a jerk, so he's a jerk back. And with Elsa he's a hero." [...] It was difficult to lay the foundation for Anna's belated turn to Kristoff without also making Hans' betrayal of Anna too predictable, in that the audience had to [...] "feel... her feeling something but not quite understanding it... Because the minute it is [...] it deflated." [...] At one point, Anna openly flirted with Kristoff upon first meeting him, but that was changed after Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn pointed out that it would confuse and annoy viewers since Anna was already engaged to Hans.|$|E
500|$|In mid-2010, {{the entire}} group were in Los Angeles for a birthday, where Manson {{suggested}} they book a studio and spend time writing. Along with Garbage's long time engineer and Manson's husband Billy Bush, the band, as Bush described, [...] "hung out for a couple weeks, drank some wine and played a bunch of music”. Three or four song ideas came together during this time. [...] "But we didn't go right into making-a-record mode", Erikson recalled. [...] "It took {{a bit of time}} for us to realize that we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an album." [...] Erikson described reconvening as a piecemeal process, saying that it informally began with the first phone conversations among them since their hiatus, as they discussed playing together again. After convening, and composing and performing song ideas together through multiple sessions, they then decided to move forward with the band and embark on a full-length album. The project took off in February 2011, when Manson called Vig proposing to reunite the band and try making a new record. Manson convoked the group out of an eagerness [...] "to make loud music again". [...] "I'm a loud person", she proclaimed; [...] "I love noise and aggression. I crave contact. I needed to make that connection again. I think we all did. To get something back up when there was absolutely no momentum took a Herculean effort on everybody's part. It's like pulling yourself out of mud. Even to stand back up and say 'we're going to take another swing at this' was a scary feeling, and I'm proud of us for trying. It's much easier to stay at home.” ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Variable" [...] was the {{hundredth}} {{episode of the}} show to be produced and aired on television. Josh Holloway, who {{plays the role of}} Sawyer, said, [...] "Just statistically speaking, to hit a hundred episodes doesn't happen very often, especially on a show where everyone is saying 'Lost on an island? What are you gonna do after a season or two?', so the fact that we've lasted not only a season or two but flourishing still at this time... it's shocking... it's amazing to me." [...] In an interview with The News & Observer, Lindelof recalled meeting with the ABC executives in 2004 to pitch the idea of a plane crash and survivors stranded on an island full of mystery and danger. When Lindelof was asked by the executives where the Lost saga would stand in the future, he replied, [...] "We're probably not going to get past episode thirteen. Let's all be honest about that up front." [...] Lindelof added that if he had [...] "traveled back in time to tell myself after that meeting that we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it to a hundred and still have a season beyond that, I would have laughed in my face." [...] The hundredth episode milestone was celebrated by the cast and crew on location in Oahu, Hawaii. Duff Goldman and his crew from the Food Network's American television show Ace of Cakes made a special Lost cake for the party to commemorate the milestone. The cake featured replicas of a Dharma beer bottles, the computer from the Swan station, a suitcase and a miniature Oceanic Flight 815. The Ace of Cakes episode ("LOST in Hawaii") featuring the making of the cake aired on the Food Network in the United States on May 9, 2009.|$|E
