5|$|Horder {{prescribed}} her an antidepressant, a {{monoamine oxidase}} inhibitor, {{a few days}} before her suicide.

Commentators have argued that because antidepressants may take up to three weeks to take effect, her prescription from Horder would not have taken full effect.|$|E

Mary Godwin, on the other hand, came to detest her stepmother. William Godwin's 19th-century biographer C. Kegan Paul later suggested that Mrs Godwin had favoured her own children over those of Mary Wollstonecraft.|$|E
