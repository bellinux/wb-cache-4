5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1942–43, the Finnish Defence Forces {{estimated}} there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>immediate</b> prospect of a quick end to the Continuation War {{but there was an}} immediate need for new vehicles. In the longer term, the army was expected to need at least 7,000 lorries and buses. Neutral countries such as Sweden and Switzerland were willing to sell vehicles to Finland but demanded payment in advance and in their own currencies. As Finland did not have sufficient currency reserves the only option was to develop domestic vehicle production.|$|E

Her first live performances of the songs were at Saturday Night Live and the Billboard Music Awards. In January 1999, Hill recruited a band and began rehearsals for what would become The Miseducation Tour. As soon as the tour was announced, tickets immediately sold out.|$|E

5|$|As Leader of the Opposition, Douglas-Home persuaded Macleod and Powell {{to rejoin}} the Conservative front bench. Within weeks of the general {{election}} Butler retired from politics, accepting the post of Master of Trinity College, Cambridge together with a life peerage. Douglas-Home did not immediately allocate shadow portfolios to his colleagues, but in January 1965 he gave Maudling the foreign affairs brief and Heath became spokesman on Treasury and economic affairs. There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>immediate</b> pressure for Douglas-Home {{to hand over the}} leadership to a member of the younger generation, but by early 1965 a new Conservative group called PEST (Pressure for Economic and Social Toryism) had discreetly begun to call for a change. Douglas-Home either did not know, or chose to ignore, the fact that Heath had made a donation to PEST. He decided that the time was coming for him to retire as leader, with Heath as his preferred successor.|$|E
5|$|Sverdrup's {{main task}} now {{was to keep}} his crew busy. He ordered a {{thorough}} spring cleaning, and set a party to chip {{away some of the}} surrounding ice which was threatening to destabilise the ship. Although there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>immediate</b> danger to Fram, Sverdrup oversaw the repair and overhaul of sledges, and the organisation of provisions should it after all be necessary to abandon ship and march to land. With the arrival of warmer weather as the 1895 summer approached, Sverdrup resumed daily ski practice. Amid these activities a full programme of meteorological, magnetic and oceanographic activities continued under Scott Hansen; Fram had become a moving oceanographic, meteorological and biological laboratory.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, Bretagne was based in Toulon. At the time, Italy remained neutral, so there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>immediate</b> threat to the Mediterranean Fleet. In December, Bretagne covered convoy traffic in the Atlantic. On 4 December, she and Provence, along with the cruisers Colbert, Dupleix, and Primauguet and several destroyers and submarines operated out of Dakar. Around {{the middle of the}} month, the task force began to return to the Mediterranean. After returning to Toulon, Bretagne underwent an extensive overhaul, which lasted until 3 March 1940. On 11 March, she left France carrying 1,820 boxes of gold bars from the French treasury along with the cruiser Algérie, which carried another 1,179 boxes. They arrived in Halifax on 10 April. On the return voyage, they escorted two American merchant ships carrying 82 aircraft bought by France and arrived at Toulon on 10 April. On 27 April, Bretagne and her two sisters were transferred to Alexandria. Bretagne and Provence returned to Mers El Kébir on 18 May.|$|E

25|$|In December 2010, {{budgetary}} pressures led to {{the early}} retirement of all Harrier IIs from service, at which point {{it was the last}} of the Harrier derivatives remaining in British service.

25|$|David McGreavy (born 1951) is an English-born {{convicted murderer}} who killed three small {{children}} in the United Kingdom in 1973.

25|$|There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>immediate</b> {{reaction}} to Judge Crater's disappearance.

Only when he failed to appear for the opening of the courts on August 25 did his fellow justices become alarmed. They started a private search but failed to find any trace of him. The police were finally notified on September 3 and, after that, the missing judge was front-page news.|$|E

25|$|When Sydney did {{not arrive}} on schedule, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>immediate</b> concern: the {{northbound}} journey with Zealandia {{could have taken}} longer than expected, Durban may have been late to the rendezvous, Sydney could have diverted to aid southbound merchant shipping, or minor engine problems may have occurred. Warships were expected to maintain wireless silence unless absolutely necessary; none of these were sufficient reason to break silence and inform Fremantle of the delay. When the ship failed to arrive by 23 November, wireless communications stations (initially those in Fremantle, then all high-power stations in Australia) began signalling ordering Sydney to report in.|$|E
25|$|Because there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>immediate</b> use for her, she {{was placed}} in {{ordinary}} and moored in the River Medway. Internal fitting out continued in a somewhat desultory manner {{over the next four}} years, and sea trials were completed in 1769, after which she was returned to her Medway berth. She remained there until France joined the American War of Independence in 1778. Victory was now placed in active service as part of a general mobilisation against the French threat. This included arming her with a full complement of smooth bore, cast iron cannon. Her weaponry was intended to be thirty 42-pounders (19kg) on her lower deck, twenty-eight 24-pounders (11kg) on her middle deck, and thirty 12-pounders (5kg) on her upper deck, together with twelve 6-pounders on her quarterdeck and forecastle. In May 1778, the 42-pounders were replaced by 32-pounders (15kg), but the 42-pounders were reinstated in April 1779; however there were insufficient 42-pounders available and these were replaced with 32-pounder cannons instead.|$|E
25|$|In March 2010, the WTO {{ruled that}} European governments unfairly financed Airbus. In September 2010, a {{preliminary}} report of the WTO found unfair Boeing payments broke WTO rules and should be withdrawn. In two separate findings issued in May 2011, the WTO found, firstly, that the US defence budget and NASA research grants {{could not be used}} as vehicles to subsidise the civilian aerospace industry and that Boeing must repay $5.3 billion of illegal subsidies. Secondly, the WTO Appellate Body partly overturned an earlier ruling that European Government launch aid constituted unfair subsidy, agreeing with the point of principle that the support was not aimed at boosting exports and some forms of public-private partnership could continue. Part of the $18bn in low interest loans received would have to be repaid eventually; however, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>immediate</b> need for it to be repaid and the exact value to be repaid would be set at a future date. Both parties claimed victory in what was the world's largest trade dispute.|$|E

25|$|In October 1939, a {{month after}} the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Hawkesworth was given command of the 12th Infantry Brigade. The brigade formed part of the 4th Infantry Division, then commanded by Major General Dudley Johnson. The brigade was then serving with the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France, although, unlike in the First World War, there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>immediate</b> action and, in late 1939, the brigade moved to the Maginot Line near Metz, where it engaged the enemy in patrolling actions. He commanded the brigade throughout the Battle of France, finally being forced to retreat to Dunkirk where his brigade was evacuated to England at the end of May 1940, leaving France himself on 1 June. In August he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire and was also mentioned in despatches for his service in France and Belgium. In December Hawkesworth was appointed Director of Military Training at the War Office in the acting rank of major general in which role he was responsible for general military training for other ranks {{at a time when the}} British Army was rapidly growing in size.|$|E
25|$|In the {{original}} plan, the Woodlands MRT line had only four stations: Admiralty, Woodlands, Marsiling and Yew Tee. They would service commuters in Choa Chu Kang North, Woodlands West, Woodlands Central and Woodlands East. Two more stations {{were added to}} the plan later to include Sembawang and Kadut Industrial Estate. Construction work was supposed to take place in two phases, with four stations opening first and the remaining two (Sembawang and Kadut) later. However, the government and the Mass Rapid Transit Corporation (MRTC; now known as SMRT Corporation) subsequently made the decision to open the Sembawang Station with those in the first phase. It was also decided that Kadut Station would be built at a later stage (depending on the development of housing plans in the area), as there <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>immediate</b> need for an MRT station there. Instead, a new station, Kranji, was added to the plan. The entire line was to be built above ground and would measure a total of 16 km. The eventual stations built were Yew Tee, Kranji, Marsiling, Woodlands, Admiralty and Sembawang to serve the estates of Choa Chu Kang North, Kadut Industrial Estate, Woodlands West, Woodlands Central, Woodlands East and Sembawang.|$|E
25|$|There <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>immediate</b> {{search and}} seizure {{as a result of}} the first program. Although five cases were heard by two judges at that point, any judge could have secured {{potential}} evidence without waiting for the combining of the cases. Opposition parties criticized the lack of immediate action, attributing it to government-appointed chief of prosecutors Alejandra Gils Carbó. Several neighbours reported on April 17 that documentation was removed from the Madero Center (the alleged location of La Rosadita) over a several-hour period; a {{search and seizure}} was conducted the following day. Casanello requisitioned security-camera tapes to ascertain if documents were removed before the operation, and the investigation suggested that information may have been erased from computers between the first program and the search-and-seizure operation. It was discovered that Austral Construcciones (owned by Lázaro Báez and operating with large sums of money) was a client of La Rosadita and its telephones had Báez on speed dial. The son of Daniel Pérez Gadín (Báez's accountant) was identified in the security tapes as one of the men removing papers, boxes and file folders before the search and seizure; Casanello opened a separate investigation.|$|E
