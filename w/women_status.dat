40|$|Few data on {{physical}} activity habits among populations of low socioeconomic status have been published. The authors studied physical activity habits—leisure-time physical activity, job-related physical activity, household physical activity, and walking—among 172 lower socioeconomic <b>status</b> <b>women</b> and 84 lower socioeconomic status men and compared their habits {{with those of}} 208 higher socioeconomic <b>status</b> <b>women</b> and 95 higher socioeconomic status men. All subjects resided in the greater Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, area. Data collection occurred throughout 1986. Lower socioeconomic <b>status</b> <b>women,</b> the least active group, averaged 1, 536 ± 1, 701 minutes/week (±standard deviation) of total physical activity, whereas higher socioeconomic <b>status</b> <b>women,</b> the most active group, averaged 2, 079 ± 1, 807 minutes/week (p < 0. 0001). Higher socioeconomic status men averaged 1, 952 ± 1, 799 minutes/week, and lower socioeconomic status men averaged 1, 948 ± 1, 916 minutes/week. Higher socioeco-nomic <b>status</b> <b>women</b> spent significantly more time each week in leisure-time physical activity, job-related physical activity, and household physical activity than did lower socioeconomic <b>status</b> <b>women.</b> Lower socioeconomic <b>status</b> men spent significantly more time each week walking and doing household chores, whereas higher socioeco-nomic status men {{tended to be more}} active in leisure-time physical activity. These data suggest important quantitative and qualitative differences in physical activity among population subgroups. In view of the important role of physical activity in promoting physical and mental health, reasons for the differences among groups of varying socioeconomic status must be examined and elucidated.

Several fields of science, such as sociology, anthropology, and economy contributed to the knowledge in this area, in addition to recent developments in feminist and pos-colonial studies. As a result, there are different gender approaches to development. The first objective {{of this paper is to}} stress the role of women in rural development, identifying their roles, the main gender approaches to development and <b>women</b> <b>status</b> under international law framework. The second aim is to analyze the position of women in East Timor with respect to social aspects, namely the gender roles, the family, access to natural resources and <b>women</b> <b>status</b> under the legal system and the traditional law. This analysis used documental sources of information and observations made in East Timor in 2000 and 2003. The contribution of East Timorese women to the development is heavy constrained by the gender inequality present in traditional/customary law, in which unequal access to natural resources, in special land access, is relevant. The HRBA seems to be the best approach to a full integration of women in the development process, once it vindicates the right to equality and non discrimination and advocates training and empowerment as means to make women exercise their rights.
