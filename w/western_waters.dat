5|$|On August 5, 1824, {{the pirate}} and a {{skeleton}} crew captured the sloop María {{off the coast}} of Guayama as she completed a run between Guayanilla and Ponce under the command of Juan Camino. After boarding the ship they decided not to plunder her, since a larger craft was sailing towards them. The pirates fled west, intercepting a second sloop (La Voladora) off Morillos. Cofresí did not plunder her either, instead requesting information from captain Rafael Mola. That month a ship commanded by the pirates stalked the port of Fajardo, taking advantage of the lack of gunboats capable of pursuing their shallow-draft vessels. Shortly afterwards, the United States ordered captain Charles Boarman of the USS Weasel to monitor the <b>western</b> <b>waters</b> of Puerto Rico as part of an international force. The schooner located a sloop commanded by the pirates off Culebra, but it fled to Vieques and ran inland into dense vegetation; Boarman could only recover the ship.|$|E

Other fish caught on the eastern coast include jewfish, golden {{trevally}} and surf bream, while whiting, flathead and surf bream prefer the calmer <b>western</b> <b>waters.</b> Pilchards, bloodworms, yabbies, pipi and sandworms can all be used for bait. Fishing is banned in the island's creeks and lakes.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1540 the Barbary pirate Ali Hamet, a Sardinian renegade {{in service}} of the Ottoman Empire, formed a small fleet at Algiers, as ordered by Admiral Hayreddin Barbarossa. He {{assembled}} three galleys, five galliots, six fustas and two brigantines, manned by 900 captive oarsmen and 2,000 Turkish soldiers and Valencian Moriscos {{under the command of}} General Caramani, a former slave in the Spanish galleys. In August, knowing that Spanish galleys were in the Balearic Islands, the fleet set sail to the <b>western</b> <b>waters</b> of the Alborán Sea. A few days later a thousand soldiers from the galleys landed on the beach of Gibraltar and attacked the village. Although they failed to capture the well-protected castle, 73 civilians were taken prisoner, 40 vessels moored in the port were plundered, and a galley under construction (owned by Don Álvaro de Bazán the Elder) was burnt. The prisoners were carried off to Vélez de la Gomera, on the Moroccan coast, where they were imprisoned until their release following a payment of 7,000 ducats.|$|E

40|$|The {{political}} {{patterns of}} <b>Western</b> <b>water</b> policy are best explained as cooperation among the few, or "elites". The extent of elitism is demonstrated across four eras of <b>Western</b> <b>water</b> policy, the Foundation of Elites (1880 s- 1920 s); the Emergence of Elites (1920 s- 1930 s); the Golden Age of concrete (1930 s- 1960 s); and the Era of Diminishing Returns (1970 s- Present). The four phases test for elitism in a three step process. First, California and Arizona water politics serve as case studies {{to distinguish between}} elite and non-elite water interests. Second, the magnitude of elite control over <b>Western</b> <b>water</b> policy {{is tied to the}} "geopolitical" importance of the Colorado River. Over time Los Angeles' interests have come to dominate water policy in the Southwest. Third, change away from elitism to a more equitable political environment is explored. Alternatives include pluralism, liberalism, and idealism. These options offer insight on how change away from elite politics might effect <b>Western</b> <b>water</b> policy in the nineties...|$|R

2500|$|On 15 March 1943, a new {{numbering}} system for USN fleets saw Task Force 44 become Task Force 74 of the United States Seventh Fleet. On 11 April, Australia {{was sent to}} investigate rumours of Japanese landings along the south-eastern shore of the Gulf of Carpentaria, but {{found no evidence of}} Japanese activity. The ships of the task force continued on with convoy escorting, refits, and patrols until 29 June, when Australia and five other ships were deployed to keep the sea lines of communication through the Coral and Arafura Seas, and to assist any transports in these areas. After encountering no Japanese forces and receiving no calls for assistance, the ships withdrew to the Flinders Group on 4 July. Six days later, Task Force 74 was sent to Espiritu Santo to reinforce the United States Third Fleet, which had lost four cruisers to torpedoes (one sunk, three withdrawn for major repairs) while supporting the New Georgia Campaign. Arriving on 16 July, Australia and the other ships were assigned to Espiritu Santo's <b>western</b> <b>waters.</b> At sunset on 20 July, Task Force 74 was returning to Espiritu Santo when [...] was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine: Crutchley believed that the submarine had fired at Australia at long range, but the speed of the task force may have been underestimated, causing the torpedoes to miss the heavy cruiser, while one hit the following Hobart.|$|E

60|$|Furthermore, Colonel Clark was off {{the next}} morning at dawn to buy a Mississippi keel-boat. He had her rigged up with two four-pounders and four swivels, filled her with provisions, and called her the Willing.

60|$|While the Northwesters {{continued}} {{to push their}} enterprises into the hyperborean regions from their stronghold at Fort William, and to hold almost sovereign sway over the tribes of the upper lakes and rivers, the Mackinaw Company sent forth their light perogues and barks, by Green Bay, Fox River, and the Wisconsin, to that areas artery of the West, the Mississippi; and down that stream to all its tributary rivers.

60|$|The {{glory of}} Columbus {{does not depend}} upon {{the parts of the}} country he visited or the extent of coast along which he sailed; it embraces the {{discovery}} of the whole western world.
