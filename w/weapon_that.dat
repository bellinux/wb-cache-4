5|$|Working in {{collaboration}} with the United Kingdom and Canada, with their respective projects Tube Alloys and Chalk River Laboratories, the Manhattan Project, under the direction of Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, designed and built the first atomic bombs. Groves appointed J. Robert Oppenheimer to organize and head the project's Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, where bomb design work was carried out. Two types of bombs were eventually developed. Little Boy was a gun-type fission <b>weapon</b> <b>that</b> used uranium-235, a rare isotope of uranium separated at the Clinton Engineer Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The other, known as a Fat Man device (both types named by Robert Serber), was a more powerful and efficient, but more complicated, implosion-type nuclear <b>weapon</b> <b>that</b> used plutonium created in nuclear reactors at Hanford, Washington. A test implosion weapon, the gadget, was detonated at Trinity Site, on July 16, 1945, near Alamogordo, New Mexico.|$|E

The party defeats Destroy, melting him in lava. The party then quickly escapes from the melting cube to rejoin their families.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Wily's Revenge is {{an action}} and {{platform}} game in same vein as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) Mega Man games. The player is tasked with completing {{a series of}} four stages in any order desired. Beating a stage's boss will earn the player a special <b>weapon</b> <b>that</b> can be selected at will and used {{throughout the rest of}} the game. Dr. Wily's Revenge specifically takes components of the original Mega Man and Mega Man 2, including their enemies, stage aesthetics, and Robot Masters.|$|E

5|$|Elite Force {{includes}} {{an arsenal of}} Star Trek–themed weapons, such as phasers and disruptors. The weapons vary in power, ammunition consumption and effectiveness in given situations. Usually, the player {{is equipped with a}} hand phaser, a low-damage <b>weapon</b> <b>that</b> automatically recharges ammunition, and a phaser compression rifle, a more powerful weapon with an optional sniper mode for long distance kills. Other weapons, acquired as the game progresses, include grenade launchers, stasis weaponry and pulse energy weapons. The player can restock on ammunition by using wall-mounted terminals that dispense weapon energy, or by picking up certain items in the game environment.|$|E
5|$|In 2263, {{the great}} evil appears in deep {{space in the}} form of a giant ball of black fire, and destroys an attacking Earth spaceship. The Mondoshawans' current contact on Earth, priest Vito Cornelius, informs the President of the Federated Territories of the history of the great evil and the <b>weapon</b> <b>that</b> can stop it. As the Mondoshawans return to Earth they are ambushed by Mangalores, a race hired by the {{industrialist}} Jean-Baptiste Emanuel Zorg, who has been directed by the great evil (sending messages as “Mister Shadow”) to acquire the element stones.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{the demons}} learn {{of a giant}} {{structure}} {{on one of the}} moons orbiting the planet, Malduke, that was designed to be a space station for residential and military purposes, possessing a powerful <b>weapon</b> <b>that</b> could destroy Filgaia. Inside the demons' newly-arisen tower Ka Dingel that connects with Malduke, Rudy, Jack, and Cecilia confront what remains of their adversaries before reaching the teleportation device to take them to Malduke. Within Malduke's deepest sanctum, they confront Zeikfried, who transforms into a revived Mother. This new being, Motherfried, confronts the heroes with the intent of using Malduke's primary weapon to destroy Filgaia, but is defeated.|$|E

5|$|Other {{deviations}} from the texts may appear in the attributes held by the divine couple. Parvati may hold a mirror, instead of the lotus. Shiva may be shown holding the trishula (trident) and damaru (drum) in his back hands. Regional variations in iconography may also occur. In Bengal, Shiva holds a karttari (knife), the ceremonial <b>weapon</b> <b>that</b> a Hindu groom from Bengal is expected to carry in a wedding.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} a large arsenal of weapons {{which can be}} collected and freely switched by players throughout the game and require no reloading. Weapons that are recurrent throughout the series make a return, including the super shotgun and BFG 9000. The BFG has a very small ammunition capacity but is extremely powerful. Similarly, the chainsaw returns but has been reintroduced as a special-use <b>weapon</b> <b>that</b> relies upon fuel, but {{can be used to}} instantly cut through enemies and provide a greater-than-normal drop of ammunition for the player.|$|E
5|$|Underwire bras are {{occasionally}} {{linked to}} health conditions including breast pain, mastitis, and metal allergies. Women wearing an underwire bra {{have in a}} few rare instances been subjected to extra scrutiny when their bra set off metal detectors at security checkpoints in airports or prisons.

5|$|Unlike the {{warships}} of Antiquity, Byzantine and Arab ships did not feature rams, and {{the primary}} means of ship-to-ship combat were boarding actions and missile fire, {{as well as the}} use of inflammable materials such as Greek fire. Despite the fearsome reputation of the latter, it was only effective under certain circumstances, and not the decisive anti-ship <b>weapon</b> <b>that</b> the ram had been in the hands of experienced crews.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Szilard {{switched}} to biology. He invented the chemostat, discovered feedback inhibition, and {{was involved in}} the first cloning of a human cell. He publicly sounded the alarm against the possible development of salted thermonuclear bombs, a new kind of nuclear <b>weapon</b> <b>that</b> might annihilate mankind. Diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1960, he underwent treatment using a cobalt-60 treatment that he had designed. He helped found the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he became a resident fellow. Szilard founded Council for a Livable World in 1962 to deliver “the sweet voice of reason” about nuclear weapons to Congress, the White House, and the American public. He died in his sleep {{of a heart attack in}} 1964.|$|E
5|$|As Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) {{attempts}} {{to negotiate with}} the Aldeans, they briefly allow Dr. Crusher to reunite with her son on the planet. Wesley hints about the Custodian to her, while she secretly passes him a tricorder to scan the Aldeans. After Picard fails to get the Aldeans to agree to the children's return, they fire an energy <b>weapon</b> <b>that</b> sends the Enterprise three days away from Aldea at maximum warp. The Aldeans warn that they can send the Enterprise an impossibly far distance if they refuse to cooperate. During the return trip, Dr. Crusher reviews the scanner results and finds the Aldeans are suffering from radiation poisoning, which has harmed their reproductive capabilities but can be reversed if the source is discovered. On arrival back at the planet, Picard orders the crew {{to try to find a}} way through the planet's shield while he restarts negotiations.|$|E

5|$|At {{the outset}} of his reign, Caracalla {{declared}} divine support for Egyptian deity Serapisa god of healing. The Iseum et Serapeum in Alexandria was apparently renovated during Caracalla's co-rule with his father Septimius Severus. The evidence for this exists in two inscriptions found near the temple that appear to bear their names. Additional archaeological evidence exists for this {{in the form of}} two papyrii that have been dated to the Severan period and also two statues associated with the temple that have been dated to around 200AD. Upon Caracalla's ascension to sole ruler in 212, the imperial mint began striking coins bearing Serapis' image. This was a reflection of the god's central role during Caracalla's reign. After Geta's death, the <b>weapon</b> <b>that</b> had killed him was dedicated to Serapis by Caracalla. This was most likely done to cast Serapis into the role of Caracalla's protector from treachery.|$|E
5|$|In Mexico, Kinne and her {{traveling}} companion, Francis Puglise, {{were soon}} {{caught up in}} another criminal case when Kinne, claiming to have been acting in self-defense, shot and killed a Mexican-born American citizen named Francisco Parades Ordoñez, who she claimed attempted to rape her. Ordonez {{was shot in the}} back. An employee of the hotel in which the shooting occurred, responding to the sound of gunshots, was also wounded but survived. Investigation into the shootings showed that Ordoñez was shot with the same <b>weapon</b> <b>that</b> killed Patricia Jones. Kinne was convicted in October 1965 of the Mexican crimes and sentenced to ten years in prison, later lengthened to thirteen years after judicial review. Kinne escaped from the Mexican prison during a blackout in December 1969. Despite extensive manhunts, her whereabouts are unknown.|$|E
5|$|In an {{alternate}} universe, Joker (Richard Epcar) tricks Superman (George Newbern) into killing a pregnant Lois Lane, which detonates a nuclear <b>weapon</b> <b>that</b> destroys Metropolis and kills millions. Batman (Kevin Conroy) interrogates Joker (on {{where he got}} the weapon) after the attack, but a devastated Superman breaks into the interrogation room and murders Joker in retribution. Over the following years, Superman becomes a ruthless tyrant who establishes a unified world government named the One Earth Regime that eliminates crime through a worldwide authoritarian regime, which he leads as its High Councillor, but Batman establishes an insurgency against his regime, and a war breaks out between the two factions, leaving the Justice League disbanded.|$|E

5|$|In folklore, silver was {{commonly}} {{thought to}} have mystic powers: for example, a bullet cast from silver is often supposed in such folklore the only <b>weapon</b> <b>that</b> is effective against a werewolf, witch, or other monsters. From this the idiom of a silver bullet developed into figuratively referring to any simple solution with very high effectiveness or almost miraculous results, as in the widely discussed software engineering paper No Silver Bullet. Silver also has more negative cultural meanings: the idiom , referring to a reward for betrayal, references the bribe Judas Iscariot is said in the New Testament to have taken from Jewish leaders in Jerusalem to turn Jesus of Nazareth over to soldiers of the high priest Caiaphas.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, many {{academics}} left the University of California, lured away by higher-salary offers {{and by the}} University's peculiar loyalty oath requirement. Segrè chose to take the oath and stay, but this did not allay suspicions about his loyalty. Luis Alvarez was incensed that Amaldi, Fermi, Pontecorvo, Rasetti and Segrè had chosen to pursue patent claims against the United States for their pre-war discoveries and told Segrè {{to let him know}} when Pontecorvo wrote from Russia. He also clashed with Lawrence over the latter's plan to create a rival nuclear-weapons laboratory to Los Alamos in Livermore, California, in order to develop the hydrogen bomb, a <b>weapon</b> <b>that</b> Segrè felt would be of dubious utility.|$|E
5|$|Jeremy and Alysa {{escape the}} ruins and pursue the vampires that stole the Blood Seal. Castello {{and the holy}} order are also {{pursuing}} the vampires. Jeremy and Alysa reach Godskeep, a human stronghold. In order {{to pass through the}} town, the pair must first rescue the town's sheriff, who went into a nearby forest with the town guard in an attempt to kill the powerful vampire Blood Fox. Jeremy and Alysa defeat Blood Fox, and in the town, Jeremy encounters Bartholomew, who split from Castello after an argument. Bartholomew tasks Jermey with recovering the Relic of Light, a powerful <b>weapon</b> <b>that</b> can be used against the vampires, in order to prove that Jeremy is still loyal to the order.|$|E
