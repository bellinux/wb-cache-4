5|$|In 1950, <b>Whites</b> {{represented}} 94.7% of Boston's population. From the 1950s {{to the end}} of the 20th century, {{the proportion}} of non-Hispanic <b>whites</b> in the city declined; in 2000, non-Hispanic <b>whites</b> made up 49.5% of the city's population, making the city majority-minority for the first time. However, in the 21st century, the city has experienced significant gentrification, in which affluent <b>whites</b> have moved into formerly non-white areas. In 2006, the US Census Bureau estimated that non-Hispanic <b>whites</b> again formed a slight majority. But , in part due to the housing crash, as well as increased efforts to make more affordable housing more available, the non-white population has rebounded. This may also have to do with increased Latin American and Asian populations and more clarity surrounding US Census statistics, which indicate a non-Hispanic white population of 47 percent (some reports give slightly lower figures).|$|E
5|$|The Reds {{carried out}} an {{unsuccessful}} general offensive in February 1918, supplied with weapons by Soviet Russia. A counteroffensive by the <b>Whites</b> began in March, reinforced by an Imperial German Army squad in April. The decisive combats were the Battle of Tampere and Viipuri, {{won by the}} <b>Whites,</b> and the Battles of Helsinki and Lahti, won by German troops, leading to overall victory of the <b>Whites</b> and the German forces. Both the Reds and <b>Whites</b> engaged in political terror. A high number of Red POWs died due to malnutrition and disease. Altogether, around 39,000 people – 36,000 Finns – perished in the conflict.|$|E
5|$|A race riot {{broke out}} in May 1943 of <b>whites</b> against blacks. ADDSCO {{management}} had long maintained segregated conditions at the shipyards, although the Roosevelt administration had ordered defense contractors to integrate facilities. That year ADDSCO promoted 12 blacks to positions as welders, previously reserved for whites; and <b>whites</b> objected to the change by rioting on May 24. The mayor appealed to the governor to call in the National Guard to restore order, but it was weeks before officials allowed African Americans to return to work, keeping them away for their safety.|$|E

5|$|After {{the defeat}} in Tampere, the Red Guards began a slow retreat eastwards. As the German army seized Helsinki, the White Army shifted the {{military}} focus to Viipuri; 18,500 <b>Whites</b> raided against 15,000 Red defending troopers. General Mannerheim's Vyborg plan {{was affected by}} the battle for Tampere, the civilian industrial town. He aimed to avoid a new bloody city combat, in Viipuri - the old border ground military fortress. The Jäger detachments tried to destroy and bind the Red force outside Viipuri, and conquer the lamed town area in a mild battle. The <b>Whites</b> were able to cut the Reds' connection to Petrograd and weaken the troops, in the fierce combats, in the Karelian Isthmus on 20–26 April, but the decisive blow remained in besieged Viipuri. The final attack to the city began on late 27 April with a heavy, concentrated Jäger artillery barrage. The Reds' tough defence in the street combat collapsed gradually and eventually the <b>Whites</b> conquered Patterinmäki - the symbolic Last Stand-hill of the Finnish Red 1918 Uprising - {{in the center of}} Viipuri, on early hours of 29 April 1918. In total 400 <b>Whites</b> and 500–600 Reds died and 12,000–15,000 were imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{existence}} of distinct racial and cultural communities, 19th century Brazil developed as a multi-ethnic nation. However the data is problematic as no reliable information is available for the years prior to 1872. The first official national census was compiled by the government in 1872 showing that out of 9,930,479 inhabitants there were 38.1% <b>whites,</b> 38.3% browns, 19.7% blacks and 3.9% Indians.

5|$|Following their {{experiences}} with the Sitgreaves and Whipple expeditions, and encounters with Mormons and the soldiers at Fort Yuma, the Mohave were aware that <b>whites</b> were immigrating to the region in increasing numbers. It was difficult for the Mohave to predict {{the behavior of the}} arriving <b>whites,</b> some of whom, like Whipple, were amiably disposed towards them, whereas others such as the Mormons were hostile. The kwanami were divided on how the situation should be approached; some advocated an aggressive posture, denying <b>whites</b> all passage through their territory, but others, including Irataba, preferred a peaceful approach, or even an alliance with them that could put the Mohave in a stronger position relative to their traditional enemies the Paiute, Chemehuevi, and Walapai.|$|E
5|$|In chess {{tournaments and}} matches, the {{frequency}} with which each player receives white and black is an important consideration. In matches, the players' colors in the first game are determined by drawing lots, and alternated thereafter. In round robin tournaments with an odd number of players, each player receives an equal number of <b>whites</b> and blacks; with an even number of players, each receives one extra white or black. Where one or more players withdraws from the tournament, the tournament director may change the assigned colors in some games so that no player receives two more blacks than <b>whites,</b> or vice versa. The double-round robin tournament is considered to give the most reliable final standings, since each player receives the same number of <b>whites</b> and blacks, and plays both White and Black against each opponent.|$|E
5|$|Race {{relations}} were tense during the Reconstruction era, as <b>whites</b> resisted freedmen {{being allowed to}} choose their labor, vote, and have freedom of movement. Following a fire that damaged many businesses, the riot of 1871 erupted, with <b>whites</b> attacking blacks in the community. The black community had expanded after the war, as people moved to the city for more opportunity and to create community away from white supervision.|$|E

5|$|White Brazilians {{descended from}} the {{original}} Portuguese settlers. From the 1870s onwards this ethnic group also included other European immigrants: mainly Italians, Spaniards and Germans. Although <b>whites</b> could be found throughout the country, they were the majority group in the southern region and in São Paulo province. <b>Whites</b> also comprised a significant proportion (40%) {{of the population in}} the northeastern provinces of Ceará, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte. Black Brazilians of Sub-Saharan African ancestry inhabited the same areas as mulattoes. The majority of the population of Rio de Janeiro, Minas Gerais, Espírito Santo, Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas and Pernambuco provinces (the last four having the smallest percentages of <b>whites</b> in the whole country—less than 30% in each) were black or brown.

5|$|After the Bolshevik {{revolution}} in October 1917, Russia quickly disintegrated into civil war. Negotiations {{for the release}} of the Romanovs between their Bolshevik (commonly referred to as 'Reds') captors and their extended family, many of whom were prominent members of the royal houses of Europe, stalled. As the <b>Whites</b> (anti-Bolshevik forces, although not necessarily supportive of the Tsar) advanced toward Yekaterinburg, the Reds were in a precarious situation. The Reds knew Yekaterinburg would fall to the better manned and equipped White Army. When the <b>Whites</b> reached Yekaterinburg, the imperial family had simply disappeared. The most widely accepted account was that the family had been murdered. This was due to an investigation by White Army investigator Nicholas Sokolov, who came to the conclusion based on items that had belonged to the family being found thrown down a mine shaft at Ganina Yama.|$|E
