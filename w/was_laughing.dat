5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E
25|$|All {{four of the}} {{officers}} involved have since quit or have been fired from the LAPD. Officer Theodore Briseno left the LAPD after being acquitted on federal charges. Officer Timothy Wind, who was also acquitted a second time, was fired after the appointment of Willie L. Williams as Chief of Police. Chief Williams' tenure was also short-lived. The Los Angeles Police Commission declined to renew his contract, citing Williams' failure to fulfill his mandate to create meaningful change in the department {{in the wake of}} the Rodney King disaster. Susan Clemmer, an officer who gave crucial testimony for the defense at the initial trial, committed suicide in July 2009 in the lobby of a Los Angeles Sheriff's Station. She rode in the ambulance with King and testified that he <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> and spat blood on her uniform. She had remained in law enforcement and was a Sheriff's Detective at the time of her death.|$|E

500|$|Baby Gerald, Luigi Risotto, Assistant Superintendent Leopold, and Flanders' parents {{make their}} first {{appearances}} {{on the show}} in this episode. Leopold and Luigi were designed by David Silverman, one of the show's directors.

When Anderson skimmed through the script and saw Luigi's lines, he said he [...] "frightened Julie Kavner because I <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> to myself, but trying to keep the laughter in because it was so damn funny." ...|$|E
500|$|Two new sets {{of parents}} are {{introduced}} during the episode. Emma's parents, Rose and Rusty Pillsbury, are played by Valerie Mahaffey and Don Most.

[...] Both Most and Mahaffey were so funny during the shooting of their sequence {{that she had to}} apologize for causing a portion to have to be reshot, telling them, [...] "I'm so sorry, the back of my shoulders were shaking because I <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> so hard." ...|$|E

Sometimes revenge can be fun. But getting to sing it again [...] came very naturally and it was hilarious to practice! The silly language and whimsy of The Sims games are a perfect fit for the song. I <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> the entire time!" [...] Also, an animated music video was made for the Simlish version.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by David Silverman. When the episode was originally planned, it called for Albert Brooks to voice [...] "Björn", a Swedish tennis instructor, but Brooks {{thought it would be}} funnier to make the character French and so the change was made. The title was originally to be [...] "Bjorn to Be Wild", thus accounting for the episode's alternate title [...] "Jacques to Be Wild". Brooks improvised almost all of his dialogue, producing over three hours of material. Marge's laugh during her bowling lesson was an ad-libbed, natural laugh by Julie Kavner, who <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> at something Albert Brooks had just said. The line [...] "four onion rings!" [...] was one of the many lines that Brooks ad-libbed and when saying it, Jacques loses his French accent. An extended audio clip of Albert Brooks' unused dialogue was made available on Disc Three of The Simpsons The Complete First Season DVD.|$|E
500|$|The {{shots at}} the Hooters {{restaurant}} were filmed relatively early in the day, {{and a majority of}} the scenes were improvised by Carell. In fact, Carell decided to play the penis game – in which two or more people shout the word [...] "penis" [...] at varying levels in an attempt to out do each other – which Krasinski called [...] "the craziest thing I have experienced." [...] The scene where Pam and Kelly discuss wedding plans was particularly difficult to shoot all in one scene, due to the amount of activity going on. John Krasinski later noted that he was impressed that the director and cameramen were able to successfully get the shot. The sequence featuring Michael and Jim talking in the break room was made of two composition shots, because Krasinski <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> [...] "the entire" [...] time. Michael buying Stanley a peach ice tea and telling him that he will [...] "hate it" [...] was entirely improvised.|$|E
500|$|Writer Steven Moffat, {{who is also}} head {{writer and}} {{executive}} producer of the series, wanted to make the special [...] "really Christmassy" [...] because the previous Christmas special, The End of Time, had been darker than usual as it led to the Tenth Doctor's (David Tennant) regeneration. He stated that he had [...] "never been so excited about writing anything. I <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> madly as I typed along to Christmas songs in April". Moffat stated that A Christmas Carol was [...] "probably [...] favourite Christmas story" [...] and that it lent itself to Doctor Who, as there was an aspect similar to time travel in the story. He also pointed out that the Doctor intentionally based his reform of Kazran on Dickens' story; Dickens exists as a character in the Doctor Who universe, having appeared in the 2005 episode [...] "The Unquiet Dead". The concept of the sky shark was based on Moffat's childhood fear of sharks which had evolved to swim outside the water.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, upon leaving church, Scalia {{was asked}} by a {{reporter}} whether being a traditionalist Catholic had caused problems for him, and he responded by asking, [...] "You know what I say to those people?" [...] and with a gesture, cupping his hand under his chin and flicking his fingers out. The gesture, which got captured by a photographer, was initially reported by the Boston Herald as obscene. Scalia responded to the reports with {{a letter to the}} editor, accusing the news staff of watching too many episodes of The Sopranos and stating that the gesture was a strong brush-off. Roger Axtell, an expert on body language, described the gesture as possibly meaning [...] "I've had enough, go away" [...] and noted, [...] "It's a fairly strong gesture". The gesture would later be parodied by comedian Stephen Colbert during his performance at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner later that year, with the justice in attendance: cameras showed that unlike most of the butts of Colbert's jokes that evening, Scalia <b>was</b> <b>laughing.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Everybody's Fool" [...] {{was directed by}} Philipp Stölzl and it was filmed in Los Angeles, California in mid-April 2004. Talking about the filming {{and the development of}} the video, Lee said: [...] "There's this one scene with everybody on motorbikes that every time I see it I just crack up. It's the slow-mo scene where I take off the helmet and swoosh my hair and look at the camera ... and it kills me. It's so hilarious, it's ridiculous. [...] It's a really different thing for us to do because it's not performance at all. Everybody <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> at me the whole time. I was just like, 'Please don't laugh at me. Just give me five minutes so I can do this.'" [...] Lee added that the message of the video is {{in the name of the}} products her character is advertising, each of which are called [...] "Lies" [...] because according to her [...] " [...] whole life is a lie. Every smile, that's a lie." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Monkey Gone to Heaven"'s main {{theme is}} environmentalism. The song mainly deals with man's {{destruction}} {{of the ocean and}} [...] "confusion of man's place in the universe". [...] "On one hand, it's [...] this big organic toilet. Things get flushed and repurified or decomposed and it's this big, dark, mysterious place", Black later said, [...] "It's also a very mythological place where there are octopus's gardens, the Bermuda Triangle, Atlantis, and mermaids." [...] Francis came up with the song's hook, [...] "this monkey's gone to heaven", long before the song itself was written. The line itself forms a basis for the song, which revolves around man's relationship with the divine and environmentalism. After Francis set the developing lyrics to music, he rushed to lead guitarist Joey Santiago's apartment to play it to him. Santiago later commented on the nascent performance: [...] "It was early in the morning, I was still so tired. [...] 'Hey Joe, I need to come over. I need to show you something.' [...] It was awesome, really good. He had the 'If man is five' part there, and he <b>was</b> <b>laughing.</b> [...] It was hilarious".|$|E

500|$|In {{the weeks}} that {{followed}} the premiere Renoir reduced the film's running time from its original 113 minutes to 100 minutes, then to 90 minutes and finally to 85 minutes. He told Margurite Renoir and Zwobada to cut the scenes that the audience had found the most upsetting. Renoir said he mostly cut his own scenes or dialogue [...] "as though I were ashamed, after this rebuff, of showing myself on the screen." [...] He later defended his own performance as being awkwardthe way Octave should have been. The reduction in length removed Octave's complexity and completely changed the character's motives {{at the end of the}} film. In the 85 minute version Octave does not intend to run away with Christine and merely lends André his coat for warmth before sending him out to the greenhouse. The omission of this plot point resulted in the misconception that the film has an alternative ending; this was first reported by Roger Manvell after he watched it at its London premiere in 1946. At one point Jean Jay told Renoir to restore the film to the 100-minute version [...] "to avoid commercial disaster", but none of the shorter versions improved its reception or attendance figures. When asked about the film's poor reception with audience members, Renoir said [...] "I thought I was gentle with them, and they thought I <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> at them." ...|$|E
500|$|Orr {{was also}} known for his mean streak. Former coach Don Cherry recounts an {{incident}} one night in Los Angeles during a game that the Bruins were losing. With a minute to go, Orr pulled one of the Bruins off the ice, left the bench and attacked a Los Angeles Kings player. Asked why, Orr said to Cherry [...] "He <b>was</b> <b>laughing</b> at us." [...] According to Cherry, he fought a lot. On another occasion in November 1967, Orr was clipped in the face by a stick from the Toronto Maple Leafs' Brian Conacher. Boston teammate Johnny McKenzie flattened Conacher from behind and started punching Conacher. Orr, cut and bleeding, {{got up from the}} ice, pulled MacKenzie off Conacher and started punching Conacher. Conacher, who was not fighting back, was also sucker-punched by the Bruins' Ken Hodge. Orr would be booed in Toronto from that date onwards. Orr was frequently compared to Brad Park, who played a similar style to Orr and later succeeded Orr as Boston's top defenceman, and the two often fought each other on-ice, fueling the bitter rivalry between the Bruins and New York Rangers. Park said [...] "I saw no reason to be upset because I was rated second to Bobby Orr. After all, Orr not only was the top defenceman in the game but he was considered the best player ever to {{put on a pair of}} skates. There was nothing insulting about being rated number two to such a super superstar".|$|E
500|$|The 1912 and 1913 Prom seasons are {{singled out}} by Cox as among the finest {{of this part of}} Wood's career. Among those {{conducting}} their own works or hearing Wood conduct them were Strauss, Debussy, Reger, Scriabin, and Rachmaninoff. Schoenberg's Five Pieces for Orchestra also received its first performance (the composer not being present); during rehearsals, Wood urged his players, [...] "Stick to it, gentlemen! This is nothing to what you'll have to play in 25 years' time". The critic Ernest Newman wrote after the performance: [...] "It is not often that an English audience hisses the music it does not like, but a good third of the people at Queen's Hall last Tuesday permitted themselves that luxury after the performance of the five orchestral pieces of Schoenberg. Another third of the audience was only not hissing because it <b>was</b> <b>laughing,</b> and the remaining third seemed too puzzled either to laugh or to hiss; so that on the whole it does not look as if Schoenberg has so far made many friends in London." [...] However, when Wood invited Schoenberg himself to conduct the work's second British performance, on 17 January 1914, the composer was so delighted with the result, more warmly received than had been the premiere, that he congratulated Wood and the orchestra warmly: [...] "I must say {{it was the first time}} since Gustav Mahler that I heard such music played again as a musician of culture demands." ...|$|E
