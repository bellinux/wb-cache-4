60|$|The dew {{fell and}} the flowers closed; cattle grazed on in the river meadows, feeling with their tongues for the grass they could not see; and the sheep on the Downs lay quiet as stones. Pheasants in the tall trees of the Pangbourne <b>woods,</b> <b>larks</b> on their grassy nests above the gravel-pit at Wansdon, {{swallows}} in the eaves at Robin Hill, and the sparrows of Mayfair, all made a dreamless night of it, soothed {{by the lack of}} wind. The Mayfly filly, hardly accustomed to her new quarters, scraped at her straw a little; and the few night-flitting things--bats, moths, owls--were vigorous in the warm darkness; but the peace of night lay in the brain of all day-time Nature, colourless and still. Men and women, alone, riding the hobby-horses of anxiety or love, burned their wavering tapers of dream and thought into the lonely hours.|$|R

50|$|The {{woodlark}} or <b>wood</b> <b>lark</b> (Lullula arborea) is {{the only}} extant species in the lark genus Lullula. It is found across most of Europe, the Middle East, western Asia and the mountains of north Africa. It is mainly resident (non-migratory) in the west of its range, but eastern populations of this passerine bird are more migratory, moving further south in winter.|$|E
50|$|In {{relation}} to its dry heaths, Woolmer Forest {{is the only}} site in Britain that supports all six native reptiles (including the sand lizard Lacerta agilis and smooth snake Coronella austriaca) and all six native amphibians (including the great crested newt Triturus cristatus). It also supports an outstanding invertebrate fauna and bird assemblage, including European nightjar Caprimulgus europaeus, <b>wood</b> <b>lark</b> Lullula arborea, Dartford warbler Sylvia undata, Eurasian hobby Falco subbuteo, hen harrier Circus cyaneus and merlin Falco columbarius.|$|E
50|$|Swinley Park and its Brick Pits is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and has {{protected}} areas {{for the birds}} that live there. As well as the extensive commercial conifer plantations and mixed woodland the nationally rare lowland heath present means Swinley Forest forms part of the Thames Basin Heaths, a designated Special Protection Area (SPA), due to the rare ground nesting birds including <b>wood</b> <b>lark,</b> Dartford warbler and European nightjar which nest in open parts of the forest.|$|E

25|$|In February 1981 the Orpington & District bus company {{collapsed}} due {{to financial}} difficulties, and the Tillingbourne Bus Company based in West Surrey took over their operations, setting up Tillingbourne (Metropolitan) Limited. In July 1983, Metrobus Limited was formed when two directors, Gary <b>Wood</b> and Peter <b>Larking,</b> purchased the subsidiary.|$|R
50|$|The site is ancient woodland, {{and used}} to be known as Endleigh Wood. Until the early twentieth century it was joined to the larger <b>Larks</b> <b>Wood.</b> The main trees are oak, {{hornbeam}} and the rarer wild service tree, which is indicative of ancient woodland. It has a variety of birds, including great spotted woodpeckers, blue tits, great tits, robins, wrens, long tailed tits and jays. It also has rich ground flora, including bluebells, dog's-mercury and wood anemone.|$|R
50|$|The region's geology {{dates back}} 70 {{million years ago}} when the older {{sedimentary}} rocks were exposed to the strong tectonic movements and to the volcano activity which caused dent and issue of the magmatic cliffs. This is why Kopaonik distinguishes itself by its geological structure of rocks of different inception and age (granites, serpentinites, slates, marbles, andesites, lime - stones). The later processes of erosion during past millenniums created present-day outlines of the relief of Kopaonik.Kopaonik's national park was established in 1981. Deciduous forests and native coniferous woodland make up most of the forested land in the park. Kopaonik has many species of birds, such as rock partridge, scops owl, red-backed shrike, and the <b>wood</b> <b>lark.</b> Soil erosion is great threat as {{there is a lot of}} logging and deforestation in the park.Sports and recreation are key factors to the tourism of Kopaonik. Kopaonik is mainly a destination for skiing and snowboarding. There are various other activities as well, such as tennis. Other features which attract tourists are a luxurious hotel, and entertainment. Kopaonik has many cafes, bars and night clubs.|$|E

5|$|In February 1981, {{the long-standing}} {{operator}} Orpington & District collapsed due to financial difficulties, so Tillingbourne decided {{to launch a}} test operation of three former O services. These proved successful, so more services were added and two new AEC Reliance coaches purchased for the operation. In July 1981, the Orpington operation was given a separate licence, under the name Tillingbourne (Metropolitan) Limited, with six vehicles allocated to it. By 1983, however, {{it became clear that}} the local area management of Tillingbourne (Metropolitan) wanted to develop the business in a different way from that of the main company. On 24 September 1983, the Orpington operation's directors, Gary <b>Wood</b> and Peter <b>Larking,</b> bought out the subsidiary to form Metrobus Limited.|$|R
40|$|The {{recent and}} active magmatic arcs of eastern Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the Solomon Islands are well endowed with sulfide {{mineralisation}} and include deposits such as Ladolam, Panguna and Solwara 1. The {{majority of the}} mineral systems in this belt are younger than four million years old, with some deposits remaining active {{to the present day}} as exemplified by active hydrothermal systems on the island of Lihir. The geodynamic setting that {{led to the formation of}} these deposits is still unresolved, with, for example, both the Pacific and Solomon Sea plates considered responsible for the formation of the Ladolam deposit on the island of Lihir under different models. In order to understand and characterise the formation of southwest Pacific mineral deposits, we must first reconstruct the complex geodynamic evolution of the region. New kinematic reconstructions show that while mineral systems in eastern PNG and the Solomon Islands are hosted within a single arc related to subduction at the New Britain and San Cristobal trenches, variable and discrete geodynamic settings exist within both the upper and lower plates throughout this region, which give rise to distinct mineralised corridors. Most notably, this region is host to: • the Solwara 1 deposit, which occurs within a major transtensional corridor in the eastern Bismarck Sea • the Ladolam deposit (Liliir), which is interpreted to have formed above but in relation to tearing of the subducting slab • the Panguna deposit, which is related to structure in the subducting slab marginal to the actively spreading <b>Wood</b> <b>lark</b> Basin. An evaluation of the nature and variability of these diverse geodynamic settings through time can provide us with a better U 1 lderstanding of the relationship between the active southwest Pacific magmatic arcs and mineral deposit formation. It may also provide insights into the diverse array of deposit settings at ancient convergent margins, with applications in mineral prospectivity studies...|$|E
