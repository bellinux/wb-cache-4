The film begins with a paraphrase of Genesis 3:24, the Biblical passage that reflects The Fall of Man. Hugh Jackman {{emphasized the importance of}} the Fall in the film: [...] "The moment Adam and Eve ate of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, humans started to experience life as we all experience it now, which is life and death, poor and wealthy, pain and pleasure, good and evil. <b>We</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> of duality. Husband, wife, we relate everything. And much of our lives are spent not wanting to die, be poor, experience pain. It's what the movie's about." [...] Aronofsky also interpreted the story of Genesis as the definition of mortality for humanity. He inquired of the Fall, [...] "If they had drank from the Tree of Life [...] what would have separated them from their maker? So what makes us human is actually death. It's what makes us special." ...|$|E

60|$|Countless and inestimable are {{the chances}} of war.

The influence of Fortune is powerfully and continually exerted. In the flickering light of conflict the outlines of solid fact throw on every side the vague shadows of possibility. <b>We</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> of 'ifs.'

60|$|It is {{doubtful}} if we shall ever see again {{a phase of}} human existence in which 'politics,' {{that is to say}} a partisan interference with the ruling sanities of the world, will be the dominant interest among serious men.

Contentious professions cease to be an honourable employment for men. The peace between nations is also a peace between individuals. <b>We</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> that comes of age.

60|$|The {{same fate}} {{attended}} Judith. When Hawkeye reached the garrison on the Mohawk he enquired anxiously after that lovely but misguided creature. None knew her--even her person {{was no longer}} remembered. Other officers had, again and again, succeeded the Warleys and Craigs and Grahams, though an old sergeant of the garrison, who had lately come from England, was enabled to tell our hero that Sir Robert Warley lived on his paternal estates, {{and that there was}} a lady of rare beauty in the Lodge who had great influence over him, though she did not bear his name. Whether this was Judith relapsed into her early failing, or some other victim of the soldier's, Hawkeye never knew, nor would it be pleasant or profitable to inquire. <b>We</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> of transgressions and selfishness, and no pictures that represent us otherwise can be true, though, happily, for human nature, gleamings of that pure spirit in whose likeness man has been fashioned are to be seen, relieving its deformities, and mitigating if not excusing its crimes.|$|E

I never saw them look delighted in my life; on the contrary, they're very fierce, are they not, Rosebud? {{especially}} the big ones that sometimes try to worry you.

6000|$|So far Socialism goes toward {{regenerating}} {{the family}} and sustaining the home. But let there be no ambiguity on one point. It will be manifest that while it would reinvigorate and confirm the home, it does quite decidedly tend to destroy what has hitherto been the most typical form of the family throughout the world, {{that is to say}} the family which is in effect the private property of the father, the patriarchal family. The tradition of the family in which we are still living, we must remember, has developed from a former state in which man owned the wife or child as completely as he owned horse or hut. He was the family's irresponsible owner. Socialism seeks to make him and his wife its jointly responsible heads. Until quite recently the husband might beat his wife and put all sorts of physical constraint upon her; he might starve her or turn her out of doors; her property was his; her earnings were his; her children were his. Under certain circumstances it was generally recognized he might kill her. To-day <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> that has faltered from the rigours of this position, but which still clings to its sentimental consequences. The wife now-a-days is a sort of pampered and protected half-property. If she leaves her husband for another man, it is regarded not as a public offence on her part, but as a sort of mitigated theft {{on the part of the}} latter, entitling the former to damages. Politically she doesn't exist; the husband sees to all that. But on the other hand he mustn't drive her by physical force, but only by the moral pressure of disagreeable behaviour. Nor has he the same large powers of violence over her children that once he had. He may beat--within limits. He may dictate their education so far as his religious eccentricities go, and be generous or meagre with the supplies. He may use his [...] "authority" [...] as a vague power far on into their adult life, if he is a forcible character. But it is at its best a shorn splendour he retains. He has ceased to be an autocrat and become a constitutional monarch; the State, sustained by the growing reasonableness of the world, intervenes more and more between him and the wife and children who were once powerless in his hands.|$|E
