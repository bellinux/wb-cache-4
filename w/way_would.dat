5|$|In the Philosophie Zoologique, Lamarck {{proposed}} that species could acquire new characteristics from influences in their environment, in two rules that he named as laws. His first law stated that use or disuse of a body's structures would {{cause them to}} grow or shrink {{in the course of}} several generations. His second law held that any changes made in this <b>way</b> <b>would</b> be inherited. Together, Lamarck's laws imply the steady adaptation of animals to their environments.|$|E

Richard took a close {{interest in developing}} the town of Lydford, creating an additional market and introducing a new fair in the 1260s. Around this time, the main tower at Lydford Castle was demolished and rebuilt, probably by Richard, possibly following a serious fire in the building. Richard was a wealthy politician and rebuilding the castle in this <b>way</b> <b>would</b> have provided him with an important status symbol in the region.|$|E

5|$|Koalas were {{hunted for}} food by Aboriginals. A common {{technique}} used {{to capture the}} animals was to attach a loop of ropey bark {{to the end of}} a long, thin pole, so as to form a noose. This would be used to snare an animal high in a tree, beyond the reach of a climbing hunter; an animal brought down this <b>way</b> <b>would</b> then be killed with a stone hand axe or hunting stick (waddy). According to the customs of some tribes, it was considered taboo to skin the animal, while other tribes thought the animal's head had a special status, and saved them for burial.|$|E

25|$|Producing {{a lot of}} tritium in this <b>way</b> <b>would</b> require {{reactors}} {{with very}} high neutron fluxes, or with a very high proportion of heavy water to nuclear fuel and very low neutron absorption by other reactor material.

25|$|But with {{a knight}} pawn (see the diagram on the right), the {{attacker}} has no file equivalent to 2... Rh2, {{so he can}} not make progress.

25|$|In 1749, Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon {{conceived}} {{the idea that}} the planets were formed when a comet collided with the Sun, sending matter out to form the planets. However, Laplace refuted this idea in 1796, showing that any planets formed in such a <b>way</b> <b>would</b> eventually crash into the Sun. Laplace felt that the near-circular orbits of the planets were a necessary consequence of their formation. Today, comets are known to be far too small to have created the Solar System in this way.|$|E
25|$|Mora {{found the}} brief to be “a wholly {{inadequate}} {{analysis of the}} law” and that the approved request was “fatally grounded on these serious failures of legal analysis” because it provided no bright line standard for what techniques would be prohibited; the techniques it approved “could produce effects reaching the level of torture”; and that “even if the techniques as applied did not reach the level of torture, they almost certainly would constitute 'cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment'”, and either <b>way</b> <b>would</b> be unlawful.|$|E

25|$|From the {{beginning}} of his term, Bush faced the problem of {{what to do about the}} federal budget debt. At $2.8trillion in 1990, the deficit had grown to three times larger than it was in 1980. Bush was dedicated to curbing the deficit, believing that America could not continue to be a leader in the world without doing so. He began an effort to persuade the Democratic controlled Congress to act on the budget; with Republicans believing that the best way was to cut government spending, and Democrats convinced that the only <b>way</b> <b>would</b> be to raise taxes, consensus building proved difficult.|$|E

25|$|Potential loss on a {{short sale}} is {{theoretically}} unlimited, {{as there is no}} theoretical limit to a rise in the price of the instrument.

In the securities markets, the seller generally must borrow the securities to effect delivery in the short sale. In some cases, the short seller must pay a fee to borrow the securities and must additionally reimburse the lender for cash returns the lender would have received had the securities not been loaned out.|$|E

25|$|The end of {{the season}} saw manager Colin Addison forced out by {{chairman}} John Fry, with the club hiring Gary Johnson as his replacement, this heralded the arrival of his son Lee Johnson with whom <b>Way</b> <b>would</b> form a formidable midfield partnership. In November 2001, Way was called up for an England National Game XI trial match against a Southern Football League XI, but had to withdraw through injury. Way's season was interrupted by injuries as he made 34 appearances as Yeovil finished third in the Conference. Yeovil's season ended on a high when on 12 May 2002, they lifted the FA Trophy {{for the first time in}} the club's history defeating Stevenage Borough 2–0 in the final, with Way playing the full 90 minutes.|$|E
25|$|Following the game, {{general manager}} Theo Epstein and manager Terry Francona each {{independently}} confirmed {{that they had}} spoken by phone {{to each other in}} the seventh and eighth innings concerning Buchholz' pitch count. He had not thrown more than 98 pitches in a game all year, and was threatening to significantly exceed that total if he finished the game. Epstein reported that in no <b>way</b> <b>would</b> Buchholz have been allowed to face a batter after reaching 120 pitches, expressing concern about excessive pitches potentially damaging such a young and inexperienced arm. Buchholz finished the game with 115 pitches, allowing Francona to escape what would have been an unpleasant decision to remove a pitcher from the game in which he was throwing a no-hitter.|$|E

During the third leg of the tour, as a support act for Muse, members of My Chemical Romance and their crew, along with members of Muse's crew, suffered food poisoning, and consequently had to cancel six shows.
