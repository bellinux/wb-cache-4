5|$|According to {{a summary}} of the research, {{atmospheric}} <b>water</b> <b>absorption</b> in such an exoplanet renders it larger in appearance across one part of the infrared spectrum, compared to wavelengths in the visible spectrum.

The planet orbits its parent star every three and a half days, and each time it passes in front of its parent star, the atmospheric contents can be analyzed by examining how the atmosphere absorbs light passing from the star directly through the atmosphere in the direction of Earth.|$|E
5|$|On April 10, 2007, Travis Barman of the Lowell Observatory {{announced}} {{evidence that}} the atmosphere of HD 209458 b contained water vapor. Using a combination of previously published Hubble Space Telescope measurements and new theoretical models, Barman found strong evidence for <b>water</b> <b>absorption</b> in the planet's atmosphere. His method modeled light passing directly through the atmosphere from the planet's star as the planet passed in front of it. However, this hypothesis is still being investigated for confirmation.|$|E

40|$|Water vapor {{plays an}} {{important}} role in Earth's radiative budget since water molecules strongly absorb the incoming solar shortwave and the outgoing thermal infrared radiation. Superimposed on the <b>water</b> monomer <b>absorption,</b> a <b>water</b> continuum <b>absorption</b> has long been recognized, but its true nature still remains controversial. On the one hand, this absorption is explained by a deformation of the line shape of the <b>water</b> monomer <b>absorption</b> lines as a consequence of a molecular collision. One the other hand, water dimers possibly contribute to <b>water</b> continuum <b>absorption.</b> Field measurements addressing water continuum and <b>water</b> dimer <b>absorption</b> in the visible and near-infrared spectral region were carried out by means of active Long Path DOAS. The spectral regions of the 4 n, 4 n+d, and 5 n water polyads were selected for the measurements. In these regions three <b>water</b> dimer <b>absorption</b> bands are predicted to exist almost free of interference by strong <b>water</b> monomer <b>absorption.</b> Within the scope of this thesis it is shown that the quality of existing spectral line databases is insuffcient to provide accurate water monomer references in order to confidently detect superimposed <b>water</b> dimer <b>absorption.</b> Therefore, only upper limits of <b>water</b> dimer <b>absorption</b> are obtained. An upper limit of Kp(301 K) = 0. 055 /atm is inferred for the water dimer equilibrium constant. The water dimer band broadening is at least 40 /cm (FWHM). <b>Water</b> continuum <b>absorption</b> is detected in all three water bands. The measured <b>water</b> continuum <b>absorption</b> and the predictions by the semi-empirical CKD_ 2. 4. 1 and MT_CKD_ 1. 0 water continuum models are of same order of magnitude. In contrast, the Ma and Tipping far wing line shape theory underestimates <b>water</b> continuum <b>absorption</b> by one order of magnitude in the 4 n and 5 n water bands, and by two orders of magnitude in the 4 n+d water band. Based on the present state of knowledge about the spectroscopic and thermochemical properties of the water dimer, their contribution to the absorption the visible and near-infrared spectral region is minor...|$|R

One scene has Linguini wet after jumping into the Seine to fetch Remy.

5|$|Irregular moons {{are small}} {{satellites}} with large-radii, inclined, and frequently retrograde orbits, {{believed to have}} been acquired by the parent planet through a capture process. They often occur as collisional families or groups. The precise size as well as albedo of the irregular moons are not known for sure because the moons are very small to be resolved by a telescope, although the latter is usually assumed to be quite low—around 6% (albedo of Phoebe) or less. The irregulars generally have featureless visible and near infrared spectra dominated by <b>water</b> <b>absorption</b> bands. They are neutral or moderately red in color—similar to C-type, P-type, or D-type asteroids, though they are much less red than Kuiper belt objects.|$|E

50|$|As with water, ice absorbs {{light at}} the red end of the {{spectrum}} preferentially as the result of an overtone of an oxygen-hydrogen (O-H) bond stretch. Compared with <b>water,</b> this <b>absorption</b> is shifted toward slightly lower energies. Thus, ice appears blue, with a slightly greener tint than liquid <b>water.</b> Since <b>absorption</b> is cumulative, the color effect intensifies with increasing thickness or if internal reflections cause the light to take a longer path through the ice.|$|R

40|$|In the {{presence}} of rain, the radar return powers from a three-frequency radar, with center frequency at 22. 235 GHz and upper and lower frequencies chosen with equal <b>water</b> vapor <b>absorption</b> coefficients, {{can be used to}} estimate water vapor density and parameters of the precipitation. A linear combination of differential measurements between the center and lower frequencies on one hand and the upper and lower frequencies on the other provide an estimate of differential <b>water</b> vapor <b>absorption.</b> Conversely, the difference in radar reflectivity factors (in dB) between the upper and lower frequencies is independent of <b>water</b> vapor <b>absorption</b> and can be used to estimate the median mass diameter of the hydrometeors. For a down-looking radar, path-integrated estimates of <b>water</b> vapor <b>absorption</b> may be possible under rain-free as well as raining conditions by using the surface returns at the three frequencies. Cross-talk or interference between the precipitation and water vapor estimates depends on the frequency separation of the channels {{as well as on the}} phase state and the median mass diameter of the hydrometeors. Simulations of the retrieval of <b>water</b> vapor <b>absorption</b> show that the largest source of variability arises from the variance in the measured radar return powers while the largest biases occur in the mixed-phase region. Use of high pulse repetition frequencies and signal whitening methods may be needed to obtain the large number of independent samples required. Measurements over a fractional bandwidth, defined as the ratio of the difference between the upper and lower frequencies to the center frequency, up to about 0. 2 should be passible in a differential frequency mode, where a single transceiver and antenna are used. Difficulties in frequency allocation may require alternative choices of frequency where the <b>water</b> vapor <b>absorptions</b> at the low and high frequencies are unequal. We consider the degradation in the retrieval accuracy when the frequencies are not optimum...|$|R

40|$|Water vapour {{is known}} to absorb {{radiation}} from the microwave region to the blue part of the visible spectrum with decreasing efficiency. Ab initio approaches to model individual absorption lines of the gaseous <b>water</b> molecule predict <b>absorption</b> lines up to its dissociation limit at 243  nm. We present the first evidence of <b>water</b> vapour <b>absorption</b> near 363  nm from field measurements using data from multi-axis {{differential optical absorption spectroscopy}} (MAX-DOAS) and long-path (LP) -DOAS measurements. The identification of the absorptions was based on the recent "POKAZATEL" line list by Polyansky et al. (2017). For MAX-DOAS measurements, we observed <b>absorption</b> by <b>water</b> vapour in an absorption band around 363  nm with optical depths of up to 2 [*]×[*] 10 − 3. The retrieved column densities from 2 months of measurement data and more than 2000 individual observations at different latitudes correlate well with simultaneously measured well-established <b>water</b> vapour <b>absorptions</b> in the blue spectral range from 452 to 499  nm (R 2 [*]=[*] 0. 89), but the line intensities at around 363  nm are underestimated by a factor of 2. 6  [*]±[*][*] 0. 5 by the ab initio model. At a spectral resolution of 0. 5  nm, we derive a maximum cross section value of 2. 7 [*]×[*] 10 − 27  cm 2  molec− 1 at 362. 3  nm. The results were independent of the used literature absorption cross section of the O 4 absorption, which overlays this <b>water</b> vapour <b>absorption</b> band.

The enhanced carbon-to-oxygen ratio and depleted levels of C and O in planet c favor a history in which the planet formed through core accretion.

Other aerial roots, such as mangrove aerial roots, are used for aeration and not for <b>water</b> <b>absorption.</b> Other aerial roots are used mainly for structure, functioning as prop roots, as in maize or anchor roots or as the trunk in strangler fig.

25|$|<b>Water</b> <b>absorption</b> at {{the colon}} {{typically}} proceeds against a transmucosal osmotic pressure gradient. The standing gradient osmosis is the reabsorption of water against the osmotic gradient in the intestines. Cells occupying the intestinal lining pump sodium ions into the intercellular space, raising the osmolarity of the intercellular fluid. This hypertonic fluid creates an osmotic pressure that drives {{water into the}} lateral intercellular spaces by osmosis via tight junctions and adjacent cells, which then in turn moves across the basement membrane and into the capillaries, while more sodium ions are pumped again into the intercellular fluid. Although water travels down an osmotic gradient in each individual step, overall, water usually travels against the osmotic gradient due to the pumping of sodium ions into the intercellular fluid. This allows the large intestine to absorb water despite the blood in capillaries being hypotonic compared to the fluid within the intestinal lumen.|$|E

The large icy satellites of Uranus have infrared spectra quite {{similar to that of}} Orcus. Among other trans-Neptunian objects Pluto's moon Charon appears to be most similar to Orcus. It has a higher albedo but very similar visible and near-infrared spectra. Their densities are also similar and both have water ice rich surfaces. Quaoar—a trans-Neptunian object of similar size—has strong water ice absorption features in its spectra but also has a very red color in the visible line implying the presence of ultrared matter on its surface. Dwarf planet Haumea and objects from its collisional family have much higher albedos and much deeper <b>water</b> <b>absorption</b> bands than Orcus.

40|$|Cerebral {{near-infrared}} spectroscopy {{can potentially}} probe several parameters {{related to the}} onset of stroke and the ensuing tissue damage. One obvious marker of ischemia is cerebral oxygenation, which can be lowered sharply in stroke-affected tissue. Also commonly assessed, though less straightforward to recover, is the redox state of the cytochrome aa 3 copper center. Finally, parameters that are in principle available but seldom recovered from in vivo near-IR spectra are changes in water concentration and scattering properties of the tissue. We have evaluated the potential for near-IR spectroscopy to detect relevant changes in cerebral oxygenation, blood volume, water content, and scattering properties in an infant rat stroke model that is well characterized by magnetic resonance imaging methods. The specific aim was to acquire near-IR spectra simultaneously with MR images and to correlate stroke-associated changes detected via these two modalities prior to, during and after a hypoxia-ischemia episode within this stroke model. Presented here are results from the design and testing of a near-IR illumination/detection system that is compatible with an MR imaging system, and the recovery of trends in the near-IR spectra that complement the hypoxic-ischemic changes observed in the MR images. Unexpectedly large intensity changes observed for the in vivo near-IR <b>water</b> <b>absorptions</b> are ascribed to hypoxia-induced variations in effective optical pathlength, suggesting that the <b>water</b> <b>absorptions</b> may prove generally useful {{as a means to}} track such changes.
