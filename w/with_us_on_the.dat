500|$|Production on {{the episode}} officially began in October 2011 at Los Angeles, California, {{after several months}} of {{research}} and development. The animators worked closely with executive producer Paul Tibbitt, creator Stephen Hillenburg, and creative director Vincent Waller to ensure the cartoon characters were properly translated into three-dimensional puppets. Hillenburg and Tibbitt provided hands-on feedback on the production on a weekly basis. [...] "They'd check out the weeklies and {{go back and forth}} <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> various gags [...] It was really a pleasurable experience when they came to visit, because we come from the same planet. It all felt very easy and natural," [...] Walsh said.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} and writers initially formed a general {{plan for the}} show {{through the end of}} a third season, after reading the screenplays for upcoming MCU films. In May 2016, Chloe Bennet likened {{the end of the third}} season to [...] "the end of the first book of S.H.I.E.L.D. ... the end of something bigger and the beginning of a whole new tone for the show." [...] She elaborated that [...] "the storylines that we started at the beginning of season 1 really wrapped up at the end of season 3. We've had some major losses of people who have been <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show since season 1. From the table read to the first day on set, there's definitely a new energy of the show" [...] moving forward. The series was moved to the later timeslot of 10 pm for the fourth season. Jed Whedon said the writers hoped to [...] "skew a little darker because of" [...] this change, with Loeb adding that [...] "It absolutely offers opportunities. I don't know that it changes things all that dramatically [...] I mean, at the end of the day, Marvel is always going to make shows that run somewhere between PG-13 and PG-16. We're not going to be making Deadpool anytime soon on [...]" [...] Marvel [...] "had a long talk with ABC about what can we get away with, so to speak" [...] in the new timeslot, which led to the inclusion of Ghost Rider in the season over one of Marvel's Netflix series, because Marvel felt [...] "that this character was right to tell [...] stories right now" [...] and having him on S.H.I.E.L.D. aided that because [...] "it was so unexpected". Loeb hoped that the combination of the later timeslot and the introduction of Ghost Rider would lead to some viewers who had stopped watching the series over the previous seasons giving it another chance.|$|E
2500|$|However, as {{recently}} as the first week of March, Chávez called upon Obama to follow the path to socialism, which he termed as the [...] "only" [...] way out of the global recession. [...] "Come with us, align yourself, come <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road to socialism. This is the only path. Imagine a socialist revolution in the United States", Chávez told a group of workers in the southern Venezuelan state of Bolívar. He said that people were calling Obama a [...] "socialist" [...] for the measures of state intervention he is taking to counter the crisis, so it would not be too far-fetched to suggest that he might join the project of [...] "21st century socialism" [...] that the Venezuelan leader is heading.|$|E

2500|$|During {{his four}} decades as musical director, Godfrey took the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company on many tours, {{including}} eleven to America. The company did not travel {{with a band}} but instead used orchestra players hired locally. [...] He recalled, [...] "We would pick up perhaps eight orchestral players in the first town, take them <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> tour and make up the orchestra with local players {{from each of the}} towns we visited.... On one occasion, I was rehearsing the Mikado overture when I noticed that one of the double-basses was plucking the strings in the opening bars. [...] I pointed out that {{it was not to be}} played pizzicato but arco, with the bow. 'Yeah', he said. 'But I haven't got a bow.' That's how it was sometimes!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Trabert {{also told}} McCauley in their {{interview}} that [...] "I appreciated his tennis ability but I {{never came to}} respect him as a person.

Instead he'd appear at the appointed hour for his match, then vanish back into the night without saying a word to anyone. We'd all stay around giving autographs to the fans before {{moving on to the next}} city. Not Pancho. On court, he was totally professional as well as a fantastic player." [...] In a 2005 interview, Ted Schroeder commented on Gonzales's intense demeanor both on and off the court, [...] "We hardly ever spoke a civil word to one another, yet we were friends. He was a very prideful man, not proud, prideful. When you understood that, you understood him.|$|E
