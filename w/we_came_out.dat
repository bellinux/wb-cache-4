Dartford's prowess is borne out by a 1723 journal entry recorded by the prominent Tory politician Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford: At Dartford upon the Heath (i.e., Dartford Brent) as <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of the town, the men of Tonbridge and the Dartford men were warmly engaged at the sport of cricket, which of all the people of England the Kentish folk are the most renowned for, and of all the Kentish men, the men of Dartford lay claim to the greatest excellence.|$|E

In an interview with MTV Cudi commented, [...] "that's always our collab formula, and that's just how 'Gorgeous' came about.

Following the band's reformation, guitarist Jim Suptic undertook an interview with website Drowned in Sound, in which he said, [...] "The punk scene <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of and the punk scene now are completely different.

Rainmen forward Forrest Fisher complained about Windsor, [...] "They're playing very physical, and at times a little bit dirty with sucker punches, and we started playing into their game (Friday) and that's not us.

500|$|The album cover, {{designed}} by Spinetta, shows a distressed {{man with his}} hair covered by a scarf and a tear running down his cheek; a toy arrow is stuck on his head, and {{he is wearing a}} pink shirt with the name of the band. Spinetta used tempera and pencils on mat paper. RCA considered the artwork incomprehensible and noncommercial, and shelved its first version. Spinetta said, [...] "We were not going to allow the record to be released without it. I had the picture in my head very clearly, and I went home and did it again. We did not want to leave things in the hands of mediocre company dudes that make album covers like [...]" [...] Emilio García said in 2008 that the label thought most record buyers were women, and artwork should depict men as handsomely as possible: [...] "They could not believe it, because the cover of an LP (at the time) featured artists' faces or holding electric guitars; <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> with a cover like that, which I still consider absolutely great." ...|$|E

Selecting the Best for One Side of a C90 |last=Doran |first=John |date=27 October 2008 |website=The Quietus}} However, the band has routinely rejected classification, particularly as a gothic rock band. Robert Smith said in 2006, [...] "It's so pitiful when 'goth' is still tagged onto the name the Cure", and added, [...] "We're not categorisable. I suppose we were post-punk when <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out,</b> but in total it's impossible [...] I just play Cure music, whatever that is." [...] Smith has also expressed his distaste for gothic rock, describing it as [...] "incredibly dull and monotonous. A dirge, really." [...] While typically viewed as producers of dark and gloomy music, the Cure have also yielded a number of upbeat songs and been part of the new wave movement. Spin has said [...] "the Cure have always been an either/or sort of band: either [...] Robert Smith is wallowing in gothic sadness or he's licking sticky-sweet cotton-candy pop off his lipstick-stained fingers." ...|$|E

500|$|The Get Up Kids {{were viewed}} {{throughout}} their existence as a prototypical emo band, having been {{major players in}} the Midwest emo movement of the mid-1990s. Their second album Something to Write Home About remains their most widely acclaimed album, and is considered {{to be one of the}} quintessential albums of the second-wave emo movement. However, like many early emo bands, The Get Up Kids sought to dissociate themselves with the term, as it was considered dismissive to be seen as an [...] "emo band." [...] The band departed heavily from their established style with the release of their 2002 album On a Wire, which saw the band take on a much more layered, alternative rock sound. Years later, guitarist Jim Suptic even apologized for having the influence they did on many of the modern third-wave emo bands, commenting that [...] "he punk scene <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of and the punk scene now are completely different.

500|$|In 1963 Waldron {{had a major}} {{breakdown}} caused by a heroin overdose. He recounted in 1998 {{that a lot of}} musicians in the 1950s and 1960s felt that taking drugs was necessary for career progression. The police assumed they were all doing it, according to Waldron: The police would stop the musicians and search us as <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of the clubs after work. We had to turn our pockets inside out. After a while, the musicians thought ... well, if you have the name you might as well have the game. Eventually, I overdosed. I couldn't remember my own name. My hands were trembling, I couldn't play the piano. I needed shock treatments and a spinal tap to bring me back. [...] Waldron always felt that he had to return to playing, but this was a slow process. About a year after the overdose, his physical recovery was sufficient to allow him to start relearning his skills, which he did partly by listening to his own records. His recovery as a musician continued for another two years, as his speed of thought was still too slow over that period to allow genuine improvisation: [...] "I worked out my solos in advance and played what I had written out, until gradually all my faculties returned".|$|E
500|$|The 2nd Raiders {{suffered}} 16killed and 17wounded (plus 2wounded native guides). Non-battle casualties totaled 225, {{of which}} 125suffered from malaria, 29 from dysentery, and 71 from ringworm or jungle rot. Most {{of the remaining}} raiders were also suffering some type of physical ailment. On 17 December, the raiders departed Guadalcanal by ship and arrived back at their home camp on Espiritu Santo on 20 December. At Espiritu Santo, the unit continued {{to be affected by}} the lingering tropical diseases many had contracted during the Guadalcanal patrol. In the second week of March 1943, the 2ndRaiders were declared unfit for combat duty, although this finding was never announced in an official document. The 2nd Marine Raiders did not participate as a unit in a combat operation until the Bougainville campaign beginning on 1 November 1943. In spite of the high fallout from disease, Carlson's troops generally felt that they had performed well as a unit during the patrol and had accomplished their mission. Cleland E. Early—a lieutenant in Carlson's Company E—described the long Guadalcanal patrol and the effect on his unit: [...] "Enduring the living conditions was worse than the combat. My platoon went in with 30men, one corpsman and one officer. When <b>we</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> we had one officer, one corpsman, and 18enlisted, all of whom had malaria, worms, diarrhea, jungle rot and high morale.|$|E
