It is {{far more}} {{sophisticated}} than StarCrafts StarEdit and s World Editor for creating custom maps and campaigns, {{and it is the}} first editor by Blizzard to feature built-in mod creation and usage support. Updated art and data from the original StarCraft that were not used, along with models and data that were scrapped during the development process (including those made as April Fools jokes) <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>available</b> <b>in</b> the editor. Unlike previous editors made by Blizzard, it is the first to have Internet connectivity features such as map publishing, retrieval, and online activation of the editor client. Lead producer Chris Sigaty has stated that the editor gives players the ability to create role-playing, Hero-type units and structures resembling those from WarCraft III. At BlizzCon 2009, Blizzard demonstrated a build of the StarCraft II Editor showcasing its capabilities, such as the ability to customize the user interface to include features such as the Item system from Warcraft III.
