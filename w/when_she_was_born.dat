Adela was 11 years younger than Miguel. They had two daughters Mirta (b. 1948) and Liliana (b. 1952), and a miscarried son in between. Liliana was long resentful of the fact that her father was abroad <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>born,</b> and didn't see her until she was four months old. She describes her father as a mixture of extremes: violent temper but compassionate and loving, selfish at times but also generous to a fault, jovial and bon vivant but also sad because of the terrible losses of the Holocaust.|$|E

Her parents were both teenagers <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>born.</b> Chastain is reluctant to publicly discuss her family background; she was estranged from Monasterio and has said that no father is listed on her birth certificate. She has two sisters and two brothers. Her sister Juliet died by suicide in 2003 following years of drug abuse. Chastain was raised in Sacramento by her mother and stepfather, Michael Hastey, a firefighter. She has said that her stepfather {{was the first person}} to make her feel secure. She shares a close bond with her maternal grandmother, Marilyn, whom she credits as someone who [...] "always believed in me".|$|E

500|$|Tubman {{was born}} Araminta [...] "Minty" [...] Ross to slave parents, Harriet ("Rit") Green and Ben Ross. Rit {{was owned by}} Mary Pattison Brodess (and later her son Edward). Ben was held by Anthony Thompson, who became Mary's second husband, and who ran a large {{plantation}} near Blackwater River in Madison, Maryland. As with many slaves in the United States, neither the exact year nor place of Araminta's birth is known, and historians differ as to the best estimate. Kate Larson records the year as 1822, based on a midwife payment and several other historical documents, including her runaway advertisement, while Jean Humez says [...] "the best current evidence suggests that Tubman was born in 1820, but {{it might have been}} a year or two later." [...] Catherine Clinton notes that Tubman reported the year of her birth as 1825, while her death certificate lists 1815 and her gravestone lists 1820. In her Civil War widow's pension records, Tubman claimed she was born in 1820, 1822, and 1825, an indication, perhaps, that she had only a general idea of <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>born.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Pisces (♓) ( [...] , pis'eez; [...] Ikhthyes) is {{the twelfth}} astrological {{sign in the}} Zodiac, {{originating}} from the Pisces constellation.

Under the tropical zodiac the sun transits this area on average between February 19 and March 20, and under the sidereal zodiac, the sun transits this area between approximately March 13 and April 13.

As thanks for freeing him, Green-Eyed One offers John three wishes. For John's wishes, he asks for nourishment for his daughter, a kingdom to raise his family, and a queen for a new wife, as the creature cannot raise the dead.|$|R
25|$|Other recent policy {{initiatives}} adopted by many states of India, claims Guilmoto, attempt {{to address the}} assumed economic disadvantage of girls by offering support to girls and their parents. These policies provide conditional cash transfer and scholarships only available to girls, where payments to a girl and her parents are linked to each stage of her life, such as <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>born,</b> completion of her childhood immunization, her joining school at grade 1, her completing school grades 6, 9 and 12, her marriage past age 21. Some states are offering higher pension benefits to parents who raise one or two girls. Different states of India have been experimenting with various innovations in their girl-driven welfare policies. For example, the state of Delhi adopted a pro-girl policy initiative (locally called Laadli scheme), which initial data suggests may be lowering the birth sex ratio in the state.|$|R

Lynette offers to give {{evidence}} for Eddie, and tell the police what a horrible woman his mother was, but Eddie confesses {{that his mother was}} not the only person he has killed. He wants to drop Lynette off {{in the middle of nowhere}} so that by the time <b>she</b> <b>is</b> able to tell somebody what he has done, he will be long gone. Lynette tells him that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> unable to go along with this plan, as she has just gone into labor. She pleads with him to take her to a hospital as <b>she</b> <b>is</b> already having contractions, but Eddie refuses, too scared that she will tell somebody what he has done. Outside, Tom pulls up after spotting Lynette's car and knocks on the door. Eddie covers Lynette's mouth to keep her quiet and <b>she</b> <b>is</b> unable to answer, so Tom leaves, thinking <b>she</b> <b>is</b> giving him the silent treatment for getting drunk the night before. By this point it is too late to go to the hospital, Lynette tells Eddie the baby is on its way, and he is forced to deliver the baby. Eddie is faced with the difficult task of saving the baby's life <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>born</b> with the umbilical cord around her neck. Eddie leaves soon after the birth, despite Lynette telling him he will never be free from his pain as long as he runs away.

His friend Gabi Hernandez (Camila Banus) is Rafe's young sister, and Will begins dating her. They graduate high school together, and on graduation day, they meet Sonny Kiriakis (Freddie Smith), who has just returned to town after traveling the world. Will and Sonny quickly become friends, and Will learns Sonny is gay. After befriending Sonny, Will avoids being intimate with Gabi, and she ends the relationship. Will catches Sami cheating on Rafe with EJ, and in an angry and upset mood, he goes to a party with Sonny, gets drunk and kisses {{a young man named}} Neil (Jesse Kristofferson). Will talks about the kiss with his grandmother Marlena Evans (Deidre Hall), who promises him her support and love. His grandma Kate also supports and accepts him, saying she has known for a long time. Will confides in Sonny that he is not ready to come out as gay, and, trying to resist his sexuality, he has a one-night stand with Gabi that results in a pregnancy. As Will enters into a relationship with Sonny, Gabi, with Will's agreement, pretends that the baby has been fathered by her new boyfriend Nick Fallon (Blake Berris), who is Will's second cousin. Will and Sonny split when the paternity of Gabi's baby is revealed, but soon reunite. Nick doesn't want Will involved in the coming baby's life because he is gay, and when Nick discovers that it was Will, not Lucas, who had shot EJ years before, he blackmails Will to sign away his parental rights. After Will and Nick are both attacked by a former prison-mate of Nick's, and Will is shot whilst trying to save Nick's life, Nick relents - and Will is correctly named as baby Arianna's father on her birth certificate <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>born.</b> <b>When</b> they leave hospital, Gabi and Arianna move in with Will and Sonny, and together they form a three-parent family, with Gabi, Will and Sonny bringing up Arianna together.|$|R
