2500|$|In {{terms of}} {{increasing}} inequality, {{the effect of}} Bush's tax cuts on the upper, middle and lower class is contentious. Some economists argue that the cuts have benefited the nation's richest households {{at the expense of}} the middle and lower class, while libertarians and conservatives have claimed that tax cuts have benefitted all taxpayers. Economists Peter Orszag and William Gale described the Bush tax cuts as reverse government redistribution of wealth, [...] " [...] the burden of taxation away from upper-income, capital-owning households and toward the <b>wage-earning</b> <b>households</b> of the lower and middle classes." ...|$|E
5000|$|Critics {{state that}} the tax cuts, {{including}} those given to middle and lower income households, failed to spur growth. Critics have further stated that the cuts also increased the budget deficit, shifted the tax burden from the rich to the middle and working classes, and further increased already high levels of income inequality. [...] Economists Peter Orszag and William Gale described the Bush tax cuts as reverse government redistribution of wealth, [...] "shifting the burden of taxation away from upper-income, capital-owning households and toward the <b>wage-earning</b> <b>households</b> of the lower and middle classes." [...] Supporters argued that the tax brackets were still more progressive than the brackets from 1986 until 1992, with higher marginal rates on the upper class, and lower marginal rates {{on the middle class}} than established by either the Tax Reform Act of 1986 or the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.Economist Simon Johnson wrote in 2010: [...] "The U.S. government doesn’t take in much tax revenue—at least 10 percentage points of GDP less than comparable developed economies—and it also doesn’t spend much except on the military, Social Security and Medicare. Other parts of government spending can be frozen or even slashed, but it just won’t make that much difference. That means older Americans are going to get squeezed, while our ability to defend ourselves goes into decline. Just because there’s a bipartisan consensus on an idea, such as tax cuts, doesn’t mean it makes sense. Today’s tax cutters have set us up for tomorrow’s fiscal crisis and real damage to U.S. national security." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the nature and}} role of household indebtedness in contemporary banking and the current financial and economic crises. It offers a concise empirical exposition of the centrality of household lending and related financial services to leading banking institutions and to the credit systems {{of a number of}} advanced and middle-income economies. It also offers socioeconomic characterizations of this debt and its macroeconomic significance from the standpoint of Marxist political economy, affording two distinctive insights. First, the concrete social content of household debt {{over the past two decades}} has helped ensure this lending remained highly profitable to lenders, making it a natural vehicle for destabilizing capital-market competition. Second, a crisis characterized by record levels of over-indebted <b>wage-earning</b> <b>households</b> is likely to pose distinctive difficulties to a process of market-based recovery. While the destruction of capital values during a crisis lays the basis for the eventual restoration of profitability and solvency for some enterprises, over-indebted <b>wage-earning</b> <b>households</b> face no analogous opportunity. Without new speculative asset-price bubbles, the restoration of their financial stability hinges on reductions in consumption or increases in wages, both of which present obstacles to a market-based process of economic recovery. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Using the Survey of Consumer Finances {{we examine}} the life cycle demand for {{different}} types of life insurance. Specifically we test for the consumer’s avoidance of income volatility {{as a result of}} the death of a <b>wage-earning</b> <b>household</b> member through the purchases of life insurance. We first develop a financial vulnerability index to control for the risk to a household. We then examine the demand for life insur-ance using several definitions of life insurance. We find, in contrast to previous research, that there is a relationship between financial vulner-ability and the amount of term life or total life insurance purchases. In addition, we find older consumers use less life insurance to protect a cer-tain level of financial vulnerability than the younger consumers. Finally, the proportion of life insurance in a household portfolio decreases as the household gets older. 1...|$|R
40|$|We provide {{empirical}} evidence on labour supply and inequality for <b>wage-earning</b> farm <b>households</b> in Spain, using two cross-sections from 1991 and 1994. The fundamental {{results can be}} divided into two groups. With respect to the labour supply: i) household size has a positive effect on male supply and a negative effect on female supply; ii) if there are children younger than 4, the female supply reduces, whereas that corresponding to males increases; iii) if the housing area is Andalusia or Extremadura, this reduces the number of worked hours by both spouses and iv) the income elasticities are negative, and both the male and female labour supplies are increasing. As regards the welfare analysis: i) monetary income is a good welfare indicator; ii) welfare inequality is lower than income inequality and, finally, iii) inequality among the <b>wage-earning</b> farm <b>households</b> in Spain has increased between 1991 and 1994.

40|$|There {{has been}} very little {{detailed}} exploration {{of the relationship between}} wage income and household inequality in South Africa despite the relevance of this issue for many contemporary growth and development policy debates. This article is directed at such an analysis. It uses a decomposition of household income inequality by income components to highlight the dominance of wage income in driving overall income inequality. This is followed by a detailed discussion of the distribution of the unemployed across different <b>wage-earning</b> <b>household</b> categories. Many of the unemployed are seen to depend on wage earners within their households, but a significant percentage of the unemployed, especially in rural areas, have no direct link to labor market earners. In such cases, the creation of employment is essential. The conclusion explores policy implications by linking our empirical findings to South African debates over the quality versus the quantity of employment.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{interactions}} between the structure of product demand, relative wages, and the allocation of economic activity across two sectors. The agrarian sector produces a homogeneous good and consists of informal firms employing adults and children. The modern sector produces a quality-differentiated product: high-quality varieties are produced by formal firms which employ only adult labour, whereas low-quality varieties are produced by informal firms which employ child labour as well. Differences in tastes and incomes across households generate demand for both high-quality varieties and the low-quality varieties. We find that stricter enforcement of child-labour regulations and increases in minimum wages can have beneficial effects {{as far as the}} incidence of child labour {{and the size of the}} formal sector are concerned. However, since these policies have undesirable welfare effects among segments of <b>wage-earning</b> <b>households,</b> they may not garner the necessary political support. child labour, informality, product quality, welfare...|$|E
40|$|The {{wind energy}} {{industry}} presently supports more than 50 businesses in California; 1200 people are employed directly in these businesses and another 4300 {{jobs have been}} created indirectly. Nearly all jobs are related to operating, maintaining, and servicing wind turbines. From biomass alone, 66, 000 jobs are supported in the United States, with a great many in rural areas. By 2010, biomass power could support more than 283, 000 U. S. jobs. The Sacramento Municipal Utility District’s (SMUD’s) Conservation Power Program has (1) spent $ 59 million locally on energy-efficiency measures, (2) avoided spending $ 45 million to purchase power from other regions, (3) increased regional income by $ 124 million, (4) created about 880 direct jobs, 250 of which were SMUD employees, and (5) added $ 22 million to the <b>wage-earning</b> <b>households</b> in the area.

Our {{objective is to}} assess {{the relative importance of}} two major determinants of segregation stressed by the economic literature (Bartolome and Ross, 2003; Brueckner et al., 1999) : (i) "Alonso sorting over space", due to the trade-off between land consumption and accessibility to the central city and (ii) "Tiebout sorting over jurisdictions", due to the taste for local public goods and by extension for all kinds of local public amenities (e. g. neighborhood externalities). Our methodology draws on Schmidheiny (2006). First, a conditional logit model is estimated for each urban area, in which moving households are assumed to sort based on jurisdiction distance to the central city and jurisdiction mean of households' incomes (as a proxy for the level of public amenities).

40|$|National audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} {{residential}} sorting by social and ethnic status in large French urban areas. Three major determinants of segregation are stressed {{in the economic}} literature (i) Alonso sorting based on distance, due to the trade-off between land consumption and accessibility to the central city, (ii) sorting based on local households’ income, due to the taste for endogenous amenities produced by residents’ income and (iii) Tiebout sorting over jurisdictions, due to the taste for local public goods. The last two mechanisms result in an interjurisdictional sorting according to jurisdiction’s average household income, while the first one leads to a radioconcentric sorting. Our objective is to assess {{the relative importance of}} these two types of sorting. Our methodology draws on Schmidheiny (2006). First, a conditional logit model is estimated for each urban area, in which moving households are assumed to sort based on jurisdictions’ distance to the central city and jurisdictions’ mean household income (as a proxy for the level of endogenous amenities and local public goods). Second, our estimation results are used to simulate the counterfactual residential patterns that would prevail if, alternatively, {{one or the other of}} these segregation channels were inactive. The contribution of the two types of sorting to the social and ethnic segregation is finally appreciated by comparing the values of dissimilarity indexes computed on the basis of the observed and counterfactual residential distributions of households.

40|$|Philippines is {{endowed with}} many natural {{resources}} {{but it is}} also confronted with a climate that annually poses threats to livelihood, food and nutrition security of its populace. High incidence of poverty and a great variation in agro-ecological setting influence food production as well as economic conditions continue to affect the country's food and nutrition security. The seasonal pattern of rainfall causes fluctuations in aspects of life, such as seasonal labor needs in agriculture and fishery, fluctuations in food security and variations in nutritional status. The present study was carried out in two different ecological settings: a lowland area in Central Luzon and a coastal area on the island of Leyte (Visayas). This study was aimed at examining the factors influencing food and nutrition security at the household and individual level and establish the magnitude of food and nutrition insecurity. In this study, child malnutrition was placed {{in the context of the}} food security situation and livelihood performance of households with pre-school children. While putting the child malnutrition issues in the wider context of food and livelihood security, a number of research questions were raised and answered in the different chapters. The first research question dealt with the factors influencing household food security and child malnutrition. Food insecurity and child malnutrition are quite common in both areas but the relationship between the two differs according to ecological setting, which in turn is differentiated by sources of income, living conditions, ownership of assets, and habitual diet. This study reveals that in <b>wage-earning</b> <b>households</b> in the lowland area, child malnutrition is less related to income and food availability than among households in the coastal area, where food and nutrition security more or less coincide. Above the food security threshold, care and morbidity are the limiting factors to nutrition security of households. This implies that while livelihood security is a pre-condition to food security, the presence of both does not always lead to better quality diets of children. Livelihood security may coincide with food security but the two do not automatically result in nutrition security in the population studied. The absence of an association of food security indicators with malnutrition suggests that different processes operate for food security and nutrition security. The relation between income and food security is context- and location-specific, with livelihood strategies as intervening variables. In this study, there appeared to be a clear difference in the evolution and type of malnutrition between the lowland and coastal area. Biological adjustments in the growth of children were noted. In the lowland area, children are short but have adequate weight-for-height, while in the coastal areas, aside from being stunted, preschool children are also wasted. These findings suggest that in the lowland area, the direct determinants of child malnutrition, which include breastfeeding, complementary food, morbidity and care, are more important than household food security. In the coastal area, high prevalence of wasting points to more prominence of food insecurity as an important determinant of child malnutrition. The second research question focused on people's ideas about food security. There are gender differences in men and women's ideas of food security. Because of their traditional role as breadwinner, men view food security in terms of stable income (livelihood) and food supply. They consider food security as being part and parcel of livelihood security. Women have broader perspective of food security. Traditionally, women are the homemakers. Their ideas of food security hinge on food sufficiency through proper management of the household's scarce resources. The third research question dealt with the qualitative changes in dietary pattern and sources of food as indicators of seasonal changes in household food security. Rice is the only staple food throughout the year in the lowland villages, while - in different proportions by season - rice and corn are eaten in the coastal area. The period of relative abundance in the lowland area as well as in the coastal area falls in the dry season. This is reflected in the lowest prevalence of food shortage in both areas during this period. However, coastal villages experience a longer period of scarcity (five months) than lowland villages (three months). While only fifty percent of households reported periodical food shortages, in general, the habitual diets were of poor quality, irrespective of the season. Research question four focused on the coping behavior of households in the two study areas. In both areas, households use a number of strategies and coping mechanisms to prevent seasonal food stress and meet actual food needs. Actions intended to solve the problem of food security in the long-term include income diversification and mobilization of assets to prevent an impending food crisis. However, my study revealed that diversifying economic activities and/or seeking new ways of livelihood generation have potential only when skills as well as jobs and other resources are available and accessible to the households. Aside from preventive strategies, several adaptive or coping mechanisms were observed. These include: mortgaging, inter-household transfers, barter, altering food preparation, cutting down on the number of meals, gathering wild foods, and - to some extent - postponing expenditures on health. Apparently, there are differences in coping strategies used by men and women, which can be attributed to their culturally determined different roles in the household. Women are highly visible in activities to meet actual food needs, while men generally dominate in income diversification and resource mobilization activities. The research shows that in both areas type, timing and sequence of actions and strategies of men and women vary according to the conditions and the degree of vulnerability that characterize the household at the start of the food crisis. Research question five dealt with gender issues. Power relations in decision-making on resource allocation and in productive and reproductive activities of men and women were examined. In both areas, men make more decisions than women. Men, being the head of the household, decide on matters related to investments and livelihood. As part of their repro­ductive role, women decide on matters concerning care and management and allocation of resources related to food procurement, preparation, distribution, and consumption. The study notes that in times of economic hardship and food crisis, women carry out specific coping activities. However, there appears to be a shift in the division of tasks between men and women, when the workload is high and women have to combine reproductive activities and working for the market. Then, men sometimes take over part of the reproductive workload of their wife. Nevertheless, findings suggest that indeed there are unequal distribution of roles and unequal division of labor between the male and female. The sixth research question focused on the role of the BIDANI program in improving livelihood, food and nutrition security. BIDANI is the acronym of Barangay Integrated Development Approach for Nutrition Improvement. It is a nation-wide extension program working through a network of state universities and colleges. As a program and a strategy BIDANI can serve as a catalyst to enhance the capability and capacity of the different stakeholders to address food problems. The comprehensive and "bottom-up" approach of BIDANI is important for enhancing local livelihood, food and nutrition security. This study shows, however, that the linkages between the three types of security cannot be taken for granted; that the one does not automatically lead to the other. BIDANI can contribute to decreasing malnutrition prevalence in real life situations. Its various intervention and development projects, including micro-credit, can produce synergistic impacts that improve nutrition. The women's income-generation activities can serve as useful vehicle for the diversification of the livelihood portfolio of the target households, which can have favorable effects on the coping ability of household. However, there are structural factors underlying the lack of livelihood security, as is apparent from the differences between the situation in the lowland and coastal villages, that for BIDANI are difficult to address. Looking at alternatives, integrated development based on the primary sector (agriculture and fishery) must be complemented by employment opportunities in other sectors to reduce poverty. Off-farm employment and the generation of jobs are a challenge for local governments and BIDANI. Being a dynamic program, BIDANI can adjust its focus to incorporate more systematically issues concerning employment and income, family size, and women's reproductive rights and health. <br clear=all style='mso-special-character:line-break; page-break-before:always...|$|E
