5|$|As English cathedrals {{are often}} {{surrounded}} by an expanse of green lawn, the plan is usually clearly visible at ground level, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case with the many European cathedrals that are closely surrounded by town or monastic buildings. The general impression is that the English cathedral sprawls across its site with many projecting limbs. These horizontal projections are visibly balanced by the strong verticals of the massive towers, which may be one, two or three in number. Many of the cathedrals, particularly those like Winchester, St. Albans and Peterborough where the towers are not particularly high, give an impression of tremendous length and {{have been described as}} resembling “aircraft carriers”.|$|E
5|$|Episodes of Holby City cost around £370,000 to produce—more {{than the}} BBC soap opera EastEnders, at £130,000 per episode, {{but less than}} Casualty at £450,000 per episode, or Dalziel and Pascoe at £700–800,000 per episode. As Holby City is a high-volume, year-round production, it has {{relatively}} low production costs. Set-up costs can be spread over many years and standing sets can be repeatedly re-used, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case for shorter series or one-off dramas.|$|E
5|$|For example, Erik Pogosyants {{composed}} the study at right, with White {{to play and}} win. His intended main line was 1. Ne3 Rxh2 2. 0-0-0#! A tablebase discovered that 1. h4 also wins for White in 33 moves, even though Black can capture the pawn (<b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> best move – in case of capturing the pawn black loses in 21 moves, while Kh1-g2 loses in 32 moves). Incidentally, the tablebase does not recognize the composer's solution because it includes castling.|$|E

5|$|In 1919, the {{trunkline}} {{running through}} Boyne City was originally labeled M-57. In 1927, the entire highway was renumbered, and since this change, the trunkline has carried the M-75 moniker. The M-75 designation was left unaltered when US27 between Gaylord and Indian River was {{converted to a}} freeway; this freeway was redesignated as I-75 in 1962. Some states, such as California, do not allow two highways in their state to carry the same highway number, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case in Michigan. A reconstruction project in 1966 bypassed some sharp curves in the roadway and straightened sections between Boyne City and Walloon Lake. As of 2008, the highway remains unaltered since the reconstruction.|$|E
5|$|The {{document}} {{proposed to}} avoid exporting money, and to include high tariffs on {{the import of}} luxury goods. This is often seen as a contradiction of The Representation of the Hacendados, but each request different things. The Representation opposed the absolute prohibition of trade with Britain, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> same than allowing it while following a protectionist policy. As secretary, Moreno reduced the tariffs on national exports, but kept high ones for imports.|$|E
5|$|There {{are both}} {{junior and senior}} fields for the {{competition}}, and the competition takes place the Friday prior to the AT American Cup, which occurs on the next day, Saturday. The incentive of the competition is to give pre-elite athletes the experience and opportunity to compete on a raised podium surface {{as well as in}} a large arena, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> norm for average USAG Optional competitions.|$|E
50|$|Following the bungled ambush of the 22 May, the Cubans {{analysed}} {{the intelligence}} {{gathered from the}} captured SADF vehicles. Cuban intelligence concluded that the South African were planning a major attack on Techipa <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> case.|$|R

25|$|Tantric sex, <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> same as Buddhist tantra (Vajrayana), is {{the ancient}} Indian spiritual {{tradition}} of sexual practices. It attributes a different value to orgasm than traditional cultural approaches to sexuality. Some practitioners of tantric sex aim to eliminate orgasm from sexual intercourse by remaining {{for a long}} time in the pre-orgasmic and non-emission state. Advocates of this, such as Rajneesh, claim that it eventually causes orgasmic feelings to spread out to all of one's conscious experience.|$|E
25|$|This is {{a special}} case of the {{standard}} form where A = 1 and B = 0. The graph is a vertical line with x-intercept equal to a. The slope is undefined.

These {{are motivated by}} our attempts to better understand and search for exotic fusion systems: fusion systems <b>which</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> fusion systems of any finite group. Our main theorems say that every saturated fusion system reduces to a reduced fusion system <b>which</b> <b>is</b> tame only if the original one is realizable, and that every reduced fusion system <b>which</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> tame <b>is</b> <b>the</b> reduction of some exotic (nonrealizable) fusion system...|$|R
