Past studies have revealed that these gullies can impact water quality from excessive erosion and create concerns regarding soldier safety. In order to better understand how gullies form and evolve overtime on military installations, a study is being conducted at Fort Riley, KS. In 2010, approximately forty gullies were identified, assessed, and measured using common erosion monitoring and surveying techniques. These gully locations, and any newly formed gullies, were remeasured using these same methods in 2012 to determine the rate of growth for each site with respect to width, depth, and headcut. Of fifty-nine gullies total, twenty one were initially included in this study.

[...] University of Washington, 2016 - 12 Aquatic {{ecosystem}} {{responses to}} changing climate and land-use are often extremely heterogeneous across landscapes: studies than quantify relationships between watershed features and biogeochemical and food web processes at intermediate scales (e. g., watershed-scale) {{would provide a}} means to extrapolate local findings across landscapes, potentially aiding future management efforts. I investigated how watershed features influence the movement of materials and energy between aquatic and terrestrial environments. I worked in a nearly pristine boreal river system in southwest Alaska (Wood River), where {{a high level of}} physical heterogeneity, coupled with natural landscape gradients, provided an opportunity to explore watershed geomorphic controls on ecosystem processes in streams. In Chapter 2 I used fatty acid biomarkers as novel tracers of food web pathways to assess how assimilation of heterotrophic bacteria and algae by stream insects varied across a landscape gradient in watershed features. I found that watershed features such as mean slope are correlated with the energetic base of food webs in boreal streams, with algal resources more important in steep streams and bacterial resources more important in flat watersheds. In Chapter 3 I used fatty acid and stable isotope tracers, coupled with several years of growth data, to investigate how stream thermal regimes affected the ability of juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) to benefit from marine resource subsidies (sockeye salmon eggs). I found that local environmental conditions (mean summer stream temperature) were a stronger control on fish growth than the magnitude of the resource subsidy, but also that individuals varied substantially in their metabolic responses to an energy-rich food source. In Chapter 4 I examined geomorphic controls on the magnitude and sources of stream CO 2 emissions from boreal streams. I found that <b>watershed</b> <b>slope</b> interacts with precipitation events to control terrestrial carbon fluxes into and out of streams. <b>Watershed</b> <b>slope</b> influences C loading and stream CO 2 fluxes by determining the amount of carbon accumulation in watersheds, {{and to a lesser extent}} by determining gas transfer velocity across the air-water interface. These patterns provide a way to extrapolate across boreal landscapes by constraining CO 2 concentration and flux estimates by local geomorphic features. In this dissertation I demonstrated that interactions between geomorphology, climate, and organisms produce incredible variability in ecosystem processes (carbon cycling, food web pathways) within a single river system, but that geomorphic features of watersheds regulate that variability...|$|E

Many physical (hydrophobicity, electrical conductivity, pH, particle size distribution, color and temperature regimes), chemical (quality and quantity of organic matter, nutrient availability) and biological (Microbial biomass, soil invertebrates living community) soil properties can be affected by forest fires.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect of urbanization on stream hydrology in hillslope watersheds. Ten streams (seven in hillslope and three in gentle <b>slope</b> <b>watersheds)</b> around Austin, Texas were selected for analysis. For each stream, we compared parameters of transfer function (TF) models estimated from daily rainfall and streamflow data collected in two study periods (October 1988 –September 1992 and October 2004 –September 2008) representing different degrees of watershed urbanization. As expected, the streams became more intermittent as the watersheds were more urbanized in all the study streams. However, the effect of urbanization on peakflow differs between hillslope and gentle <b>slope</b> <b>watersheds.</b> After watershed urbanization, peakflow increased in gentle <b>slope</b> <b>watersheds,</b> but decreased in hillslope watersheds. Based {{on the results of}} the TF models, we found that urbanization made stream not flashier but drier in hillslope watersheds. Overpumpage of aquifer has been recognized as a problem that leads to the stream dryness in the study area. However, the overpumpage alone cannot explain the differences in hydrological changes between the two types of watersheds. We attributed the reduced peakflow and stream dryness in the hillslope watersheds to land grading for construction forming stair-stepped or terraced landscape. Compared with natural hillslope, a stair-stepped landscape could infiltrate more stormwater by slowing down surface runoff on tread portions of the stair. Our findings suggest that a watershed management scheme should take into account local hydrogeologic conditions to mitigate the stream dryness resulting from urbanization in hillslope watersheds.

They consist of an array of logs felled on the contour with enough supplemental work to assure full contact with the ground.
