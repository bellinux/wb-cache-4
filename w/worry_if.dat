500|$|Demolition Plot J-7 was, like Slay Tracks and the Pa demos, {{recorded}} by Gary Young at his Louder Than You Think studios in Stockton. The recording {{took place on}} October 16 and October 17, 1989. Malkmus {{was influenced by the}} rehearsal style of jazz musicians as significant to the EP's recording, saying [...] "When we start recording, we're really focused on what we're doing. We know how it's going to sound in the studio. We don't have to <b>worry</b> <b>if</b> it's sounding good in the rehearsal space. We take those prescriptions from the great jazz people and applied them to our own framework." ...|$|E
500|$|Lombard {{was born}} in Fort Wayne, Indiana, on October 6, 1908 at 704 Rockhill Street. Christened with the name Jane Alice Peters, she was the third child and only {{daughter}} of Frederick Christian Peters (1875–1935) and Elizabeth Jayne [...] "Bessie" [...] (Knight) Peters (1876–1942). Her two older brothers, to each of whom she was close, both growing up and in adulthood, were Frederick Charles (1902–1979) and John Stuart (1906–1956). Lombard's parents both descended from wealthy families and her early years were lived in comfort, with the biographer Robert Matzen calling it her [...] "silver spoon period". The marriage between her parents was strained, however, and in October 1914, her mother took the children and moved to Los Angeles. Although the couple did not divorce, the separation was permanent. Her father's continued financial support allowed the family to live without <b>worry,</b> <b>if</b> not with the same affluence they had enjoyed in Indiana, and they settled into an apartment near Venice Boulevard in Los Angeles.|$|E

500|$|Intense media {{interest}} in the opinions and private lives {{of the royal family}} during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true. As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, told his staff: [...] "Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't <b>worry</b> <b>if</b> it's not true—so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards." [...] Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: [...] "The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not." [...] It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation. Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the Social Democratic Party – Thatcher's political opponents. Thatcher's biographer John Campbell claimed [...] "the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making". Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen, and the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift – membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter – to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major. Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Elizabeth was a [...] "behind the scenes force" [...] in ending apartheid.|$|E

2500|$|MacKenzie and {{his team}} were accused of simply inventing many {{of the stories that}} {{appeared}} in the newspaper, as well as interviews, and in some instances this proved to be the case, such as when an entirely fabricated interview with the disfigured Falklands war hero Simon Weston was published, which was criticised for [...] "inviting readers to feel revulsion at his disfigurement". MacKenzie himself once told his staff: [...] "Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the royals. Don't <b>worry</b> <b>if</b> it's not true—so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1980, Mayfield {{decided to}} move to Atlanta with his family, closing down his {{recording}} operation in Chicago and effectively ending the era of the Chicago soul sound. The label had gradually reduced in size in its final two years or so with releases on the main RSO imprint and Curtom credited as the production company. Mayfield continued to record occasionally, keeping the Curtom name alive for a few more years, and to tour worldwide. Mayfields song (Don't <b>Worry)</b> <b>If</b> There's a Hell Below, We're All Going to Go. Has been included as an entrance song on every episode of the 2017 drama series The Deuce."The Deuce" [...] tells of the germination of the sex-trade industry in the heart of New York's Times Square in the 1970's.|$|E
2500|$|Lower Than Atlantis was {{produced}} by Dan Lancaster, {{over the course of}} [...] "seven or eight months". The band brought Lancaster in because of his pop credentials, his heavy rock background and the ability to merge the two. After every recording session the group had a demo where they would re-record each instrument part-by-part. Lancaster would constantly attempt to get the best take every time, according to Duce: [...] "He'd be like: 'That was shit. You've got to do it again.' There's no bullshit." [...] Previously the band would <b>worry</b> <b>if</b> they made a mistake as it would costs a lot to hire the studio and personnel, however, since the band had their own studio they took it at a leisurely pace. Three drum tracks were recorded at the band's studio, before the band relocated to Peter Miles' studio in Devon where they recorded the remaining drum tracks.|$|E
2500|$|In the book, Social Issues in Television, a senior, nameless {{script editor}} opined that the {{abduction}} storyline sought {{to engage the}} audience {{at the expense of}} any parent's realistic concerns: [...] "We get it wrong when we take the easy route like the kidnap snatch with Vicki. My argument about this was that I am a father but have never had my kids snatched. If I'm just sitting at home and my children are out late at night and they say they're going to be back at midnight and they don't come back, you immediately think they're dead and you start to <b>worry.</b> <b>If</b> they'd actually been snatched, it would have affected my entire life forever. I would never have recovered from it. I would have been frightened every time one of them left my side. Therefore the consequence of running a storyline like that is immense. If we were being totally responsible about it the fallout on Michelle would have been, well I just don't think she would have been the same person again." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album {{had a more}} hard edged sound {{than the}} Impressions had before. On this new sound Mayfield claimed it was {{something}} he [...] "long wanted to do...but were out of category of what was expected of me and the Impressions. What I got off in the Curtis album allowed me to be more personal for myself.". The two singles off the album [...] "(Don't <b>Worry)</b> <b>If</b> There's a Hell Below, We're All Going to Go" [...] and [...] "Move on Up" [...] showcased Mayfield's new funk musical style, {{while the rest of the}} tracks were much softer soul based songs. Not having any traditional music lessons, Mayfield claimed his backing band would occasionly comment [...] "gosh, this is a terribly strange key to play in", but still played it accordingly as written. According to Joseph L. Tirabassi of Tiny Mix Tapes, [...] "We the People Who Are Darker Than Blue" [...] exemplified the [...] "gliding soul" [...] and [...] "hard-hitting funk" [...] the rest of the album veered between.|$|E
