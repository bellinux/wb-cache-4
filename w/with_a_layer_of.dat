5|$|A {{team from}} the Keck Observatory in Hawaii {{announced}} in 2006 that it had measured {{the density of the}} binary Jupiter trojan 617 Patroclus as being less than that of water ice (0.8g/cm3), suggesting that the pair, and possibly many other Trojan objects, more closely resemble comets or Kuiper belt objects in composition—water ice <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> dust—than they do the main-belt asteroids. Countering this argument, the density of Hektor as determined from its rotational lightcurve (2.480g/cm3) is significantly higher than that of 617 Patroclus. Such a difference in densities suggests that density may not be a good indicator of asteroid origin.|$|E

5|$|Another use {{concerns}} X-ray optics, especially X-ray telescopes. The mirrors of the Chandra X-ray Observatory are coated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> iridium 60nm thick. Iridium {{proved to}} be the best choice for reflecting X-rays after nickel, gold, and platinum were also tested. The iridium layer, which had to be smooth to within a few atoms, was applied by depositing iridium vapor under high vacuum on a base layer of chromium.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} dangers to the frescoes is {{automotive}} exhaust, and they are also vulnerable {{to the effects of}} the crowds of tourists that pass through the chapel every day, bringing with them heat, humidity, dust and bacteria (the latter of which can biodegrade paints and pigments). The clean plaster surfaces are more in danger from these destructive elements than they were when they were covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> smoky wax.|$|E
5|$|Research {{motivated}} by adhesive polyphenolic proteins in mussels {{led to the}} discovery in 2007 that {{a wide variety of}} materials, if placed in a solution of dopamine at slightly basic pH, will become coated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> polymerized dopamine, often referred to as polydopamine. This polymerized dopamine forms by a spontaneous oxidation reaction, and is formally a type of melanin. Synthesis usually involves reaction of dopamine hydrochloride with Tris as a base in water. The structure of polydopamine is unknown.|$|E

5|$|The {{first of}} the Artillery uniforms were a variety of {{handmade}} and personally customized uniforms. By 1862, the Confederate uniforms became organized. They became cadet gray and were to be lined <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> red around the sleeve. The pant legs were light blue. Even after the uniforms were organized many of the artillerymen wore regular clothes due to the heat and discomfort caused by the regular uniforms.|$|E
5|$|During 1997, BK revamped its French fries in North America. The {{improved}} fries were coated <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> potato-based starch, {{giving the}} fries a crisp shell that maintained its texture longer. The company introduced {{them in a}} series of advertisements that claimed the new fries tasted better than McDonald's fries in consumer taste comparisons. Other ads featured Mr. Potato Head {{in a series of}} demographically-targeted commercials. The fries were in research and development for over two years and already had been available in several markets when the advertising campaign began. In Europe, BK also sells potato wedges, a type of French fry that is thick-cut and wedge-shaped. In 1991, the company introduced Twister fries, spiral-cut fries with a spicy coating, as part of a promotional push. Part of the product's appeal was they were served in a paper drink cup as opposed to the normal fry carton. The product was designed as a short-term promotion that would be periodically reintroduced.|$|E
5|$|It has {{a smooth}} and bright surface, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> water {{surrounding}} {{the mantle of}} the planet, thought to be 100 kilometers thick. The smooth surface includes a layer of ice, while {{the bottom of the}} ice is theorized to be liquid water. The apparent youth and smoothness of the surface have led to the hypothesis that a water ocean exists beneath it, which could conceivably serve as an abode for extraterrestrial life. Heat energy from tidal flexing ensures that the ocean remains liquid and drives geological activity. Life may exist in Europa's under-ice ocean, perhaps subsisting in an environment similar to Earth's deep-ocean hydrothermal vents or the Antarctic Lake Vostok. Life in such an ocean could possibly be similar to microbial life on Earth in the deep ocean. So far, {{there is no evidence that}} life exists on Europa, but the likely presence of liquid water has spurred calls to send a probe there.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} half of the 19thcentury the {{population}} of London more than doubled, from a little under a million people in 1801 to almost two and a half million in 1851. Despite this rapid growth in population, the amount of land set aside for use as graveyards remained unchanged at approximately , spread across around 200 small sites. The difficulty of digging without disturbing existing graves led to bodies often simply being stacked on top of each other to fit the available space and covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> earth. In more crowded areas even relatively fresh graves had to be exhumed to free up space for new burials, their contents being unearthed and scattered to free up space. In some cases large pits were dug on existing burial grounds, unearthing the previous burials, and fresh corpses crammed into the available space. Intact material from burials was sold on a thriving market in second hand coffin furniture, coffin wood was burned as household fuel, and exhumed bones were shipped in bulk to the north of England to be sold as fertiliser. Decaying corpses contaminated the water supply and the city suffered regular epidemics of cholera, smallpox, measles and typhoid; in 1842 the mean working life of a London professional man was 30 years and of a London labourer just 17 years.|$|E

25|$|A common way {{of eating}} Vegemite is on toasted bread <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> butter or margarine.

25|$|At mid-latitudes, between 35° and 65° {{north or}} south, Martian glaciers are {{affected}} by the thin Martian atmosphere. Because of the low atmospheric pressure, ablation near the surface is solely due to sublimation, not melting. As on Earth, many glaciers are covered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> rocks which insulates the ice. A radar instrument on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter found ice under a thin layer of rocks in formations called lobate debris aprons (LDAs).|$|E

NIF's targets also are constructed by coating a plastic form <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>layer</b> <b>of</b> sputtered beryllium or beryllium-copper alloys, and then oxidizing the plastic out of the center.
