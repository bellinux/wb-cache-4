40|$|International audienceWe study {{enumeration}} problems using probabilistic methods, with {{application to}} verification problems. We consider the enumeration of monomials of a polynomial given {{as a black}} box, and the enumeration of discrete points <b>which</b> separate <b>two</b> polytopes in a space of dimension n, using a random walk which provides witnesses if {{the volume of the}} difference of the polytopes is large enough. The first method allows to enumerate all words of a given size <b>which</b> distinguish <b>two</b> probabilistic automata with a polynomial delay. The second method enumerates words <b>which</b> ε-distinguish <b>two</b> nondeterministic finite automata.

5|$|The {{mechanically}} rigid {{outer layer}} of Earth, the lithosphere, {{is divided into}} pieces called tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move in relation to one another at one of three types of plate boundaries: convergent boundaries, at <b>which</b> <b>two</b> plates come together, divergent boundaries, at <b>which</b> <b>two</b> plates are pulled apart, and transform boundaries, in <b>which</b> <b>two</b> plates slide past one another laterally. Earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur along these plate boundaries. The tectonic plates ride {{on top of the}} asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.|$|E

5|$|A {{state of}} {{emergency}} was declared {{for the state of}} Oaxaca shortly after Pauline made landfall. Abundant rainfall caused the River Los Perros to overflow its capacity, flooding 50municipalities in Oaxaca. The flooding damaged 12bridges, of <b>which</b> <b>two</b> were destroyed, and cut off some areas of electricity, drinking water, and telecommunications for several days. The passage of the hurricane affected thousands of houses, leaving roughly 250,000homeless in the state. At least 110people died in the state, with hundreds of thousands of residents and 1,278communities being affected.|$|E
5|$|Access to the {{navigation}} was improved for traditional canal boats {{with the opening}} of the Runcorn and Weston Canal, which was completed in 1859. The canal left the Weston Canal at Weston Point, and provided a link to Runcorn Docks, near <b>which</b> <b>two</b> flights of locks connected to the Bridgewater Canal. This link was severed in 1966, when the Runcorn to Widnes road bridge was constructed. Half of the Runcorn and Weston Canal was filled in at the same time.|$|E
5|$|After his {{graduation}} as {{an architect}} in 1878, Gaudí's first work was a set of lampposts for the Plaça Reial, the project for the Girossi newsstands and the Mataró cooperative, which was his first important work. He received the request from the city council of Barcelona in February 1878, when he had graduated but not yet received his degree, which was sent from Madrid on 15 March of the same year. For this commission he designed two types of lampposts: one with six arms, of <b>which</b> <b>two</b> were installed in the Plaça Reial, and another with three, of <b>which</b> <b>two</b> were installed in the Pla del Palau, opposite the Civil Government. The lampposts were inaugurated during the Mercè festivities in 1879. Made of cast iron with a marble base, they have a decoration in which the caduceus of Mercury is prominent, symbol of commerce and emblem of Barcelona.|$|E

5|$|After landfall, the cyclone {{accelerated}} in {{forward speed}} northward, weakening in intensity, and, by 1200UTC on October 12, Marco became an extra-tropical cyclone. It {{turned to the}} northeast and east through South Carolina, following behind Hurricane Lili to its northeast. For a time, the system's proximity to Lili resulted in hints of the Fujiwhara effect, in <b>which</b> <b>two</b> tropical cyclone appear to rotate around each other. The cold front that absorbed the weakening low was to the storm's north on October 13, though moisture from the remnants of Marco dropped heavy rainfall across the southeast United States for another day.|$|E
5|$|After the victory, a {{prize crew}} was put aboard Chesapeake. The {{commander}} of the prize, Lieutenant Falkiner, had {{a good deal of}} trouble from the restive Americans, who outnumbered his own men. He had some {{of the leaders of the}} unrest transferred to Shannon in the leg-irons that had, ironically, been shipped aboard Chesapeake to deal with expected British prisoners. The rest of the American crew were rendered docile by the expedient of a carpenter cutting scuttles (holes) in the maindeck through <b>which</b> <b>two</b> 18-pounder cannon, loaded with grapeshot, were pointed at them.|$|E
5|$|All Atlantic Category5 hurricanes {{have made}} {{landfall}} at some location at hurricane strength. Most Category5 hurricanes in the Atlantic make landfall {{because of their}} proximity to land in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, where the usual synoptic weather patterns carry them towards land, {{as opposed to the}} westward, oceanic mean track of Eastern Pacific hurricanes. Sixteen of the storms made landfall while at Category5 intensity; 2007 and 2017 are the only years in <b>which</b> <b>two</b> storms made landfall at this intensity.|$|E

The game also features a skirmish mode, which allows players to fight against each other or waves of computer-controlled enemies.|$|E
