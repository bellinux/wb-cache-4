5|$|According to Geisel's biographers Judith and Neil Morgan, Horton Hatches the Egg {{was born}} in 1940, the day after New Year's, {{when he took a}} break from drawing in his Park Avenue {{apartment}} and <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk.</b> When he returned, he noticed that he had left a window open in his studio and that the wind had blown one sketch on transparent paper on top of another, making it look like an elephant was sitting in a tree. This account was based on interviews with Geisel, who had told similar stories about the book's creation to reporters asking about his creative process since as early as 1957. The story had changed with each telling but always involved the fortuitous juxtaposition of drawings of an elephant and a tree.|$|E
25|$|On September 22, 1928, {{two days}} before Yom Kippur, four-year-old Barbara Griffiths <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> and did not come back home.

25|$|Swiss {{electrical}} engineer George de Mestral invented his first touch fastener when, in 1941, he <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> {{in the woods}} and wondered why Burdock seeds cling to his coat and dog. He discovered it could be turned into something useful. He patented it in 1955 and subsequently refined and developed its practical manufacture until its commercial introduction in the late 1950s.|$|E

25|$|That same day, Erik XIV had Sten Eriksson {{accompany}} {{him to a}} visit to Svante Sture's cell. On his knees, the king begged Sture's forgiveness, admitting {{that he had done}} him wrong and promising full reconciliation. He then left the castle. Peterson says that on his way out, Erik had a conversation with Jöran Persson, while according to Geijer, Erik <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> with Petrus Caroli, ordinary of Kalmar, who told him that his brother John had started a rebellion.|$|E
500|$|After {{helping to}} set up the Early Apollo Scientific Experiment Package, Armstrong <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> to what is now known as East Crater, [...] east of the LM, the {{greatest}} distance traveled from the LM on the mission. Armstrong's final task was to remind Aldrin to leave a small package of memorial items to deceased Soviet cosmonauts Yuri Gagarin and Vladimir Komarov, and Apollo1 astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger B. Chaffee. The time spent on EVA during Apollo11 was {{about two and a half}} hours, the shortest of any of the six Apollo lunar landing missions; each of the subsequent five landings were allotted gradually longer periods for EVA activities—the crew of Apollo17, by comparison, spent over 22hours exploring the lunar surface.|$|E
500|$|On February 17, 1840, a {{boy from}} a Greek Orthodox family in Rhodes <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> {{and did not}} return. [...] The next day his mother {{reported}} the disappearance to the Ottoman authorities. The island's governor, Yusuf Pasha, ordered a search, but several days' efforts proved fruitless. The European consuls pressed the governor to solve the case: the boy's family was Christian, though without foreign protection. [...] The Greek Christian population of Rhodes, meanwhile, had no doubts that the boy had been murdered by the Jews for ritual purposes. An eyewitness reported: [...] "It was firmly believed that the child in question was doomed to be sacrificed by the Jews. The whole island was agitated {{from one end to}} the other." [...] The assurance of the local Christians having been impressed upon the Ottoman authorities, they began searching the Jewish quarter, again in vain.|$|E

500|$|Like {{previous}} Sonic Youth albums, A Thousand Leaves {{also contains}} songs {{that deal with}} gender roles and stereotypes. The song [...] "Female Mechanic Now on Duty", sung by band member Kim Gordon, was a reaction to how journalists categorize female musicians. It was inspired by Meredith Brooks's hit [...] "Bitch". Similarly, in [...] "The Ineffable Me", Gordon expressed her opposition to such limitations. The song [...] "Karen Koltrane", sung by Ranaldo, is about a lover from his college days who had [...] "a far less extraordinary adulthood" [...] than he had first thought, while [...] "Hoarfrost", which was originally titled [...] "Woodland Ode", was inspired when Ranaldo and his wife Leah Singer <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> in the snow during a visit they made to Singer's parents in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. The track [...] "Sunday" [...] is generally considered the album's most accessible song. It was originally recorded for Richard Linklater's 1997 film SubUrbia, but was later re-recorded for A Thousand Leaves.|$|E
500|$|During {{his journey}} to Ireland, Lody met a Minneapolis doctor, John William Lee, {{who had been}} {{studying}} eye, ear, nose and throat diseases in Vienna before the outbreak of war had compelled him to leave. Lee was planning to travel back to New York aboard the RMS Baltic, leaving Queenstown (now Cobh) on 7 October, and intended {{to spend a few}} days exploring Ireland before his departure. Lody asked where Lee was planning to stay in Dublin; Lee told him that it would probably be the Gresham Hotel on Sackville Street, to which Lody replied, [...] "All right, let's go there." [...] They travelled together to the hotel, booked into separate rooms, had dinner together and went to the Empire Theatre. Lody told Lee that he had been based in Germany working for an American adding-machine company. When the conversation turned to the war, Lody opined that the German army was a very well-trained body of strong-bodied and enduring men, {{and that it would be}} hard to beat them. The following day they had breakfast together and <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> in Phoenix Park.|$|E
500|$|De Laurentiis visited Ridley Scott {{on the set}} of Gladiator and {{suggested}} to Ridley he read the novel he had bought the rights to. Scott was in the third week before principal photography was due to finish on Gladiator. Gladiator became a commercial and critical success, earning 12 Academy Award nominations. De Laurentiis asked Scott if he would like to direct the film version of Hannibal. Scott misunderstood which Hannibal he meant, thinking De Laurentiis was speaking of the general and historical figure from Carthage who nearly brought down the Roman Empire back around 200 B.C., so he replied: [...] "Basically, Dino, I'm doing a Roman epic right now. I don't wanna do elephants coming over the Alps next, old boy." [...] Scott read the manuscript in four sittings within a week, believing it to be a [...] "symphony", and expressed his desire to do it. Scott further explains how he got involved: [...] "I was shooting Gladiator in Malta and one day, for the hell of it, I <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> for half a mile down the road to the Malta Film Studio to see my old buddy Dino. I had not seen him since I'd worked on a version of Dune. This was pre-Blade Runner. Dino had pursued me to direct Dune and another film. He's always enthusiastic and aggressive and came after me when I did both Blade Runner and Alien, but I couldn't do the films. Anyway, we had an espresso together and a few days later, he called me to ask if he could visit the Gladiator set. He arrived with a manuscript of Hannibal, about a month before it was published in book form. He said: 'Let's make this one.' I haven't read anything so fast since The Godfather. It was so rich in all kind of ways." ...|$|E

2500|$|In June 1907 Stieglitz and {{his family}} sailed to Europe to visit {{relatives}} and friends. They booked passage on the SS Kaiser Wilhelm II, {{one of the largest}} and fastest ships in the world at that time. Stieglitz's wife Emmy insisted on first class accommodations, and the family had a fine stateroom on the upper decks. According to Stieglitz, sometime after their third day of travel he <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> around the ship and came upon a viewpoint that looked down toward the lower class passengers area, known on most ships as the steerage. Photography historian Beaumont Newhall wrote that it is likely the photo was taken while the ship was anchored at Plymouth, England, because the angle of the shadows indicates it was facing west, not east as it would have been while crossing the ocean. In addition there does not seem to be any sign of wind in the scene, which would have been ever present while the ship was moving.|$|E
2500|$|The {{street was}} {{finished}} in late March 1932. One of its features was a lighting system consisting of 400 lamps, {{and when this}} was first switch on for a trial on 24 March, hundreds of citizens <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> down the [...] long street. To {{make use of the}} lighting, the formal opening was held on the evening of 1 April 1932. The proceedings were chaired by Dan Sullivan, the Mayor of Christchurch, who also gave the first speech. Other speakers were David Manson (chairman of Regent Street Ltd), city councillor A. H. Andrews (chairman of the town planning committee), and Stacey. Mrs. Manson then cut the ribbon. During the opening speech of the mayor, the crowd was entertained by a person from the crowd warning of a man with a sword, reference to the de Groot incident that happened at the Sydney Harbour Bridge two weeks earlier where a protester cut the ribbon prior to the official ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|On 8 November at 5:30 P.M., Carnegie left, {{saying to}} his {{geophysicist}} Chris Van Galder {{that he would}} return by 7:00 for supper. His bush pilot Todd Svarckopf warned him to not walk {{in the snow and}} play hockey in the airport's hangar for a substitution, but Carnegie disregarded the warning. He <b>went</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>walk</b> in the snow, but did not return to the surveyor camp. At 7:30, a search was mounted. The camp's co-owner Mark Eikel drove out in a truck with Van Galder and Svarckopf searching for him. Carnegie's tracks were followed to the lake shore. On noticing wolf tracks on the shore, the three searchers went back for a rifle before continuing. Carnegie's body was found a little further on, but there were no wolves in sight at that time. Using a flashlight, the body was viewed from about 10m (32ft), many wolf tracks were visible around the body. [...] Later, when the body was being recovered, two sets of eyes were seen glowing in the dark close by. In addition, party searchers heard a wolf pack howling around the camp's vicinity.|$|E

[...] On August 7, 2008, at a solo {{performance}} in Newark, New Jersey, at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Vedder took a question from the audience requesting that he explain the meaning of [...] "Yellow Ledbetter".

[...] He went on to talk about how the song took as its subject a friend of his from Seattle whose brother served in the first Gulf War.
