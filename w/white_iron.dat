40|$|High {{chromium}} <b>white</b> cast <b>irons</b> {{are used}} {{in a number of}} applications in alumina refineries where wear is a significant issue. However, recent case studies of failures of <b>white</b> <b>irons</b> in high temperature digestion have suggested that significant corrosion of these materials is occurring and this may be leading to accelerated wear rates. In this paper, the corrosion behavior of a series of high chromium (Cr) <b>white</b> <b>irons</b> in concentrated caustic solutions is studied in the laboratory at temperatures from up to 280 °C. The morphology of the oxide films is studied along with corrosion rates measured using weight loss measurements, and this is correlated with compositional and microstructural variations in the <b>white</b> <b>irons.</b> The failure mechanisms of these <b>white</b> <b>irons</b> involve preferential corrosion of the matrix, particularly in circumstances where the matrix is pearlitic.

The {{results show that}} the microstructure of high boron <b>white</b> cast <b>iron</b> is mainly composed of many continuous and netlike eutectic borides, pearlite and ferrite under as-cast condition. The microhardness of Fe 2 B ranges in 1200 - 1600 HV whose value seems to approximate that of (Fe,Cr) 7 C 3 –type carbide (HV 1200 ~ 1800) in high chromium <b>white</b> cast <b>iron.</b> After isothermal quenching, the matrix transforms into lower bainite in which carbide precipitations are arranged in parallel rows at an angle of 60 deg to the long axis of the plates, but the morphology of boride remains nearly unchanged compared with its as-cast condition. Moreover, precipitation particles with the size of about 1 ~ 4 µm {{can be found in the}} matrix of isothermally quenched high boron <b>white</b> cast <b>iron.</b> Impact fracture morphology of isothermally quenched high boron <b>white</b> cast <b>iron</b> indicates that fracture propagated more easily through boride/matrix interface than through matrix...|$|R
40|$|The as-cast {{microstructure}} of Fe-Cr-C-V <b>white</b> <b>irons</b> {{consists of}} M 7 C 3 and vanadium rich M 6 C 5 carbides in austenitic matrix. Vanadium changed the microstructure parameters of phase {{present in the}} structure of these alloys, including volume fraction, size and morphology. The degree of martensitic transformation also depended on the content of vanadium in the alloy. The volume fraction of the carbide phase, carbide size and distribution has an important influence on the wear resistance of Fe-Cr-C-V <b>white</b> <b>irons</b> under low-stress abrasion conditions. However, the dynamic fracture toughness of Fe-Cr-C-V irons is determined mainly by the properties of the matrix. The austenite is more effective in this respect than martensite. Since the austenite in these alloys contained very fine M 23 C 6 carbide particles, higher fracture toughness was attributed to a strengthening of the austenite during fracture. Besides, the secondary carbides which precipitate in the matrix regions also influence the abrasion behaviour. By increasing the matrix strength through a dispersion hardening effect, the fine secondary carbides can increase the mechanical support of the carbides. Deformation and appropriate strain hardening occur in the retained austenite of Fe-Cr-C-V alloys under repeated impact loading. The particles of precipitated M 23 C 6 secondary carbides disturb dislocations movement and contribute to increase the effects of strain hardening in Fe-Cr-C-V <b>white</b> <b>irons...</b>|$|R

And to the left, between the railway and the dark mass of the low hill beyond, dominating the whole view, colossal, inky-black, and crowned with smoke and fitful flames, stood the great cylinders of the Jeddah Company Blast Furnaces, the central edifices of the big ironworks of which Horrocks was the manager.

40|$|Purpose. The {{development}} of heat treatment modes of <b>white</b> cast <b>irons</b> for structure {{changes in their}} eutectic constituent, namely in disturbing the monolithic structure of ledeburite colonies cementite structure and eutectic net continuity. Also the mentioned heat treatment modes are targeted to the eutectic net shift for the most suitable position {{from the point of}} plastic deforming. Methodology. The hypoeutectic <b>white</b> cast <b>irons</b> with 2. 92 … 3. 35 % carbon content and additionally alloyed by 3. 18 % vanadium have been used as the research materials. The mentioned alloys have been pre-heat treated and hot twist tested. Findings. The research results showed that the carbide net breaking by plastic deforming leads to cast irons mechanical properties increasing but has difficulties in implementation due to the <b>white</b> cast <b>irons</b> low plasticity. The influence of different pre-heat treatment modes on structure and plasticity of <b>white</b> hypoeutectic cast <b>irons</b> have been investigated. They include the isotherm soaking under the different temperatures as well as multiply soakings and thermo-cycling. The influence of eutectic level, as well as pre heat treatment modes on different composition <b>white</b> cast <b>irons</b> hot plasticity have been investigated. Originality. It was determined that the heat treatment, which leads to double α→γ recrystallization under 860 – 950 °С and reperlitization under 720 - 680 °С results in significant increase of plasticity, as well as in un-alloyed and alloyed by vanadium <b>white</b> cast <b>irons.</b> It takes place due to carbide matrix phase separation in ledeburite colonies by new phase boundaries forming especially due to carbide transformations under vanadium alloying. Practical value. The implementation of pre-heat treatment with phase recrystallization resulted in hypoeutectic <b>white</b> cast <b>irons</b> plasticity increasing.

40|$|High {{chromium}} <b>white</b> cast <b>irons</b> {{have proven}} to be a useful family of materials for wear resistant applications in high temperature Bayer liquor, as they combine high abrasion resistance with reasonable corrosion resistance. Plant experience has shown that certain alloy grades exhibit poor performance in high temperature applications {{at the end of the}} digestion circuit and it has been suggested that this is related to the corrosion resistance of these materials. In this paper, the corrosion behaviour of three grades of high chromium <b>white</b> cast <b>iron</b> was studied in pure caustic solutions at temperatures from 170 ºC to 280 ºC, with exposure times of up to 57 days. It was found that at lower temperature, the corrosion proceeded by a mechanism of degradation of the carbide-matrix interface with significant corrosion of the carbide component of the alloy. At higher temperatures, preferential corrosion of the matrix occurred in lower alloy grades, leaving carbide particles exposed to mechanical damage whilst in higher alloy grades, corrosion occurred by corrosion penetration along the carbide-matrix boundary. Corrosion resistance also correlated with the microstructure of the alloys and a number of the alloy constituents, including chromium content.
