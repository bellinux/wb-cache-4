5|$|By 9 March 2009 The World Health Organization (WHO) {{estimated}} that 4,011 people had {{succumbed to the}} <b>waterborne</b> disease since the outbreak began in August 2008, and {{the total number of}} cases recorded had reached 89,018. In Harare, the city council offered free graves to cholera victims. There had been signs that the disease is abating, with cholera infections down by about 50% to around 4,000 cases a week.|$|E
5|$|Houston {{was granted}} {{incorporation}} on June 5, 1837, with James S. Holman becoming its first mayor. In the same year, Houston became {{the county seat}} of Harrisburg County (now Harris County) and the temporary capital of the Republic of Texas. In 1840, the community established a chamber of commerce in part to promote shipping and <b>waterborne</b> business at the newly created port on Buffalo Bayou.|$|E
5|$|In 1817 Major Stephen H. Long of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers led a <b>waterborne</b> {{expedition}} from Prairie du Chien {{to reach}} Saint Anthony Falls. He documented {{much of the}} terrain today occupied by Minneapolis and Saint Paul {{as well as the}} Native American villages that existed there at the time.|$|E
5|$|About 1.2billion {{people in}} {{developing}} nations lack clean, safe water because most household and industrial wastes are dumped directly into rivers and lakes without treatment. This contributes to the rapid increase in <b>waterborne</b> diseases in humans. Out of India's 3119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities (WHO 1992). 114 cities dump untreated sewage and partially cremated bodies directly into the Ganges River. Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking, bathing, and washing. This situation is typical of many rivers in India {{as well as other}} developing countries.|$|E
5|$|New Orleans {{was settled}} on a natural high ground along the Mississippi River. Later {{developments}} that eventually extended to nearby Lake Pontchartrain were built on fill to bring them above the average lake level. Navigable commercial waterways extended from the lake into {{the interior of the}} city to promote <b>waterborne</b> commerce. After the construction of the Inner Harbor Navigation Canal in 1940, the state closed these waterways causing the town's water table to lower drastically.|$|E
5|$|The {{combined}} {{effects of}} Debby and Hurricane Kristy, which impacted Mexico's Pacific coast {{around the same}} time, rendered about 50,000people homeless. Emergency crews worked to provide shelter for those left homeless. Relief supplies were delivered by boat to towns isolated by floodwaters. Local health officials in Mexico City warned {{of the possibility of}} outbreaks of hepatitis, typhoid, and other <b>waterborne</b> diseases. In response to the threat, homes located in the northern portions of the city near the Río de los Remedios were fumigated.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} funded {{flood control}} projects involving {{the building of}} , thus aiding the speed of <b>waterborne</b> transport and allowing undeveloped areas to become irrigated farmlands. These conscription labor projects allowed for the building of new hamlets which were dependent on the government for their livelihoods. When {{the authority of the}} central government declined in the late Eastern Han period, many commoners living in such hamlets were forced to flee their lands and work as tenants on large estates of wealthy landowners. The people of older hamlets which never had to rely on central government projects for their wellbeing or existence often sought support from powerful local families.|$|E
5|$|The {{remnants}} of Xangsane moved over Thailand on October 2 and combined with monsoonal moisture {{over the north}} {{central part of the}} country, causing torrential rains and severe flooding in over 35 provinces. Floodwaters broke through levees and barriers and flooded or damaged nearly 1.3million rai (2,100km², 520,000acres) of farmland and local infrastructure. Many municipalities reported flooding of up to three meters (10ft), and the municipality of Ang Thong reported flooding of 60cm (2ft). The Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation reported 47 deaths, and villages in several provinces reported significant levels of water pollution and <b>waterborne</b> illnesses from stagnant waters.|$|E
5|$|These {{diseases}} {{swept through}} Yucatán in the 1520s and 1530s, with periodic recurrences throughout the 16th century. By the late 16th century, malaria {{had arrived in}} the region, and yellow fever was first reported in the mid-17th century. Mortality was high, with approximately 50% of the population of some Yucatec Maya settlements being wiped out. Those areas of the peninsula that experience damper conditions became rapidly depopulated after the conquest with the introduction of malaria and other <b>waterborne</b> parasites. The native population of the northeastern portion of the peninsula was almost completely eliminated within fifty years of the conquest. Soconusco also suffered catastrophic population collapse, with an estimated 90–95% drop.|$|E
5|$|<b>Waterborne</b> {{manganese}} has {{a greater}} bioavailability than dietary manganese. According to results from a 2010 study, higher levels of exposure to manganese in drinking water are associated with increased intellectual impairment and reduced intelligence quotients in school-age children. It is hypothesized that long-term exposure to the naturally occurring manganese in shower water puts up to 8.7 million Americans at risk. However, data indicates that the human body can recover from certain adverse effects of overexposure to manganese if the exposure is stopped and the body can clear the excess.|$|E
5|$|While Britain's {{seafaring}} {{and trading}} concerns ensured {{the spread of}} cricket overseas, at home it relied heavily on ease of transport and communications, most of these being <b>waterborne</b> as long journeys tended to be undertaken using coastal or river vessels. Road transport was slowly improving and, in 1706, Parliament established the first turnpike trusts that placed a length of road {{under the control of}} trustees drawn from local landowners and traders. The turnpike trusts borrowed capital for road maintenance against the security of tolls. This arrangement became the common method of road maintenance for the next 150 years and came in time to assist the spread of cricket throughout Britain.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey took up station off Tiger Island 1 October {{and fired}} at targets {{north of the}} DMZ before moving south that {{afternoon}} to engage Viet Cong targets. She accounted for six bunkers, a supply truck and an anti-aircraft site that day; additionally, she helped rescue the crew of a Marine spotting plane forced down at sea by anti-aircraft fire. On 3 October New Jersey fired on targets south of Tiger Island, and on 4 October the battleship fired on a Communist troop concentration and destroyed several bunkers. On the evening of 7 October New Jersey received reports {{that a number of}} <b>waterborne</b> logistics craft were moving south near the mouth of the Song Giang River. New Jersey responded by closing on the formation, and succeeded in sinking eleven of the craft before they could beach.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{compounds}} {{have low}} toxicity {{compared to those}} of most other heavy metals, as they are poorly absorbed by the human body when digested, and that which does get absorbed is rapidly converted to insoluble silver compounds or complexed by metallothionein. However, silver fluoride and silver nitrate are caustic and can cause tissue damage, resulting in gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, falling blood pressure, cramps, paralysis, and respiratory arrest. Animals repeatedly dosed with silver salts have been observed to experience anaemia, slowed growth, necrosis of the liver, and fatty degeneration of the liver and kidneys; rats implanted with silver foil or injected with colloidal silver have been observed to develop localised tumours. Parenterally admistered colloidal silver causes acute silver poisoning. Some <b>waterborne</b> species are particularly sensitive to silver salts {{and those of the}} other precious metals; in most situations, however, silver does not pose serious environmental hazards.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{attack on}} the north-west coast came {{on the night of}} 8/9 February, {{beginning}} with a heavy artillery and aerial bombardment of the 22nd Brigade's positions throughout the day, followed by a <b>waterborne</b> assault across the Johore Strait, which began around 10:30pm. Confronted by 16 battalions from the Japanese 5th and 18th Divisions, which concentrated upon the 2/18th's and 2/20th's positions, the 2/18th's two forward companies—'A' and 'C'—strongly resisted two frontal assaults during the day. Heavy casualties were inflicted on the Japanese {{over the course of several}} hours, but the defenders were eventually forced back by heavy indirect fire and overwhelming numbers. Exploiting the holes in the battalion's perimeter to avoid resistance, by 1:30am on 9 February the Japanese had penetrated towards battalion headquarters near the Lim Chau Kang road, threatening to roll up the battalion's rear. Varley then ordered the forward companies to make a fighting withdrawal and fall back on battalion headquarters. Heavy fighting followed, during which the Australians suffered grave losses as groups became lost in the darkness in the thick country, before the battalion was able to re-establish itself around Ama Keng.|$|E
5|$|Martín de Ursúa y Arizmendi {{arrived on}} the western shore of lake Petén Itzá with his {{soldiers}} in February 1697, and once there built a galeota, a large and heavily armed oar-powered attack boat. The Itza capital fell in a bloody <b>waterborne</b> assault on 13 March 1697. The Spanish bombardment caused heavy loss {{of life on the}} island; many Itza Maya who fled to swim across the lake were killed in the water. After the battle the surviving defenders melted away into the forests, leaving the Spanish to occupy an abandoned Maya town. The Itza and Kowoj kings (Ajaw Kan Ek' and Aj Kowoj) were soon captured, together with other Maya nobles and their families. With Nojpetén safely {{in the hands of the}} Spanish, Ursúa returned to Campeche; he left a small garrison on the island, isolated amongst the hostile Itza and Kowoj who still dominated the mainland. Nojpetén was renamed by the Spanish as Nuestra Señora de los Remedios y San Pablo, Laguna del Itza ("Our Lady of Remedy and Saint Paul, Lake of the Itza"). The garrison was reinforced in 1699 by a military expedition from Guatemala, accompanied by mixed-race ladino civilians who came to found their own town around the military camp. The settlers brought disease with them, which killed many soldiers and colonists and swept through the indigenous population. The Guatemalans stayed just three months before returning to Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, taking the captive Itza king with them, together with his son and two of his cousins. The cousins died on the long journey to the colonial capital; Ajaw Kan Ek' and his son spent the rest of their lives under house arrest in the capital.|$|E
25|$|<b>Waterborne</b> {{diseases}} {{caused by}} lack of sanitation and hygiene {{are one of the}} leading causes of death worldwide. For children under age five, <b>waterborne</b> diseases are a leading cause of death. According to the World Bank, 88 percent of all <b>waterborne</b> diseases are caused by unsafe drinking water, inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene.|$|E
25|$|Founders of microscopy, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek and Robert Hooke, {{used the}} newly invented {{microscope}} to observe {{for the first}} time small material particles that were suspended in the water, laying the groundwork for the future understanding of <b>waterborne</b> pathogens and <b>waterborne</b> diseases.|$|E
25|$|Connaughton is {{currently}} the President and CEO of Nautilus Data Technologies, the first company to deploy a <b>waterborne</b> data center.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the sector}} still faces major challenges. The {{quality of the}} {{services}} is poor, as evidenced by intermittent water supply in urban areas and limited wastewater treatment. Poor drinking water quality and sanitation lead to major outbreaks of <b>waterborne</b> diseases. major outbreaks of <b>waterborne</b> diseases swept the cities of Faisalabad, Karachi, Lahore and Peshawar in 2006. Estimates indicate that each year, {{more than three million}} Pakistanis become infected with <b>waterborne</b> diseases. In addition, many service providers do not even cover the costs of operation and maintenance due to low tariffs and poor efficiency. Consequently, the service providers strongly depend on government subsidies and external funding. A National Sanitation Policy and a National Drinking Water Policy have been approved in 2006 and 2009 respectively with the objective to improve water and sanitation coverage and quality. However, the level of annual investment (US$4/capita) still remains much below what would be necessary to achieve a significant increase in access and service quality.|$|E
25|$|In one {{outbreak}} at {{an international}} scout jamboree in the Netherlands, each person with gastroenteritis infected an average of 14 people before increased hygiene measures were put in place. Even after these new measures were enacted, an ill person still infected an average of 2.1 other people. A US CDC study of 11 outbreaks in New York State lists the suspected mode of transmission as person-to-person in seven outbreaks, foodborne in two, <b>waterborne</b> in one, and one unknown. The source of <b>waterborne</b> outbreaks may include water from municipal supplies, wells, recreational lakes, swimming pools and ice machines.|$|E
25|$|In 1993, a <b>waterborne</b> {{cryptosporidiosis}} outbreak {{occurred in}} Milwaukee, Wisconsin, US. An estimated 403,000 people became ill, including 4,400 people hospitalized. An estimated 69 people {{died during the}} outbreak, according to the CDC.|$|E
25|$|It is more {{effective}} as a disinfectant than chlorine in most circumstances against <b>waterborne</b> pathogenic agents such as viruses, bacteria and protozoa – including the cysts of Giardia and the oocysts of Cryptosporidium.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{diseases}} are grouped {{together under the}} name of <b>waterborne</b> diseases, which are diseases transmitted via fecal pathogens in water. Open defecation can lead to water pollution when rain flushes feces that are dispersed in the environment into surface water or unprotected wells.|$|E
25|$|In March 2016, Connaughton was {{appointed}} President and CEO of Nautilus Data Technologies, the first company to deploy a <b>waterborne</b> data center. He assumed {{the position of}} Nautilus Data Technologies' founder Arnold Magcale, who took {{on the role of}} Chief Technology Officer.|$|E
25|$|Sufficient {{investment}} {{should be}} given to continue monitoring over the long term. When a problem is found, action should be taken to correct it. <b>Waterborne</b> outbreaks in the United States decreased with the introduction of more stringent monitoring (and treatment) requirements in the early 90s.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that up to 5 million people die each year from preventable <b>waterborne</b> diseases, {{as a result of}} inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices. The effects of sanitation has impacted the society of people throughout history. Sanitation is a necessity for a healthy life.|$|E
25|$|Merchant mariners move cargo and {{passengers}} between nations {{and within the}} United States, and operate and maintain deep-sea merchant ships, tugboats, towboats, ferries, dredges, excursion vessels, charter boats and other <b>waterborne</b> craft on the oceans, the Great Lakes, rivers, canals, harbors, and other waterways.|$|E
25|$|The common {{routes of}} {{transmission}} for the disease-causing bacteria are fecal-oral, person-to-person sexual contact, ingestion of contaminated food (generally unpasteurized (raw) milk and undercooked or poorly handled poultry), and <b>waterborne</b> (i.e., through contaminated drinking water). Contact with contaminated poultry, livestock, or household pets, especially puppies, {{can also cause}} disease.|$|E
25|$|Contact with {{polluted}} water and flood soaked item can cause rashes, {{and if it}} comes in contact with a skin cut, a variety of infections. Public officials warned of a potential increase in <b>waterborne</b> diseases such as dysentery {{as well as an}} increased population of mosquitoes, which can carry West Nile virus.|$|E
25|$|The MDP {{has a large}} marine fleet. The marine support {{units are}} {{responsible}} for the <b>waterborne</b> security of Her Majesty's Dockyards and HM Naval Bases. The marine support units are based at HMNB Portsmouth, HMNB Devonport and HMNB Clyde. At HMNB Clyde, the marine unit works with the Fleet Protection Group Royal Marines.|$|E
25|$|Large {{quantities}} of fecal coliform bacteria in water are not harmful {{according to some}} authorities, but may indicate {{a higher risk of}} pathogens being present in the water. Some <b>waterborne</b> pathogenic diseases that may coincide with fecal coliform contamination include ear infections, dysentery, typhoid fever, viral and bacterial gastroenteritis, and hepatitis A.|$|E
25|$|The first town charter {{was granted}} by Henry I between 1120 and 1131. It gave Cambridge {{monopoly}} of <b>waterborne</b> traffic and hithe tolls and recognised the borough court. The distinctive Round Church dates from this period. In 1209, Cambridge University {{was founded by}} students escaping from hostile townspeople in Oxford. The oldest existing college, Peterhouse, was founded in 1284.|$|E
25|$|Compton is {{surrounded}} by multiple freeways which provide access to destinations throughout the region. The Long Beach and Los Angeles Ports are less than 20 minutes from downtown Compton, providing access to international destinations for customers and suppliers. The Alameda Corridor, a passageway for 25% of all U.S. <b>waterborne</b> international trade, runs directly through Compton from north to south.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to <b>waterborne</b> sources, fecal–oral transmission can also occur, {{for example in}} day-care centers, where children may have poor hygiene practices. Those who work with children are also {{at risk of being}} infected, as are family members of infected individuals. Not all Giardia infections are symptomatic, and many people can unknowingly serve as carriers of the parasite.|$|E
25|$|With the {{increasing}} use of plastic, human influence has become an issue as many types of plastics do not biodegrade. <b>Waterborne</b> plastic poses a serious threat to fish, seabirds, marine reptiles, and marine mammals, as well as to boats and coasts. Dumping, container spillages, litter washed into storm drains and waterways and wind-blown landfill waste all contribute to this problem.|$|E
25|$|Chicago's {{history and}} economy are {{closely tied to}} its {{proximity}} to Lake Michigan. While the Chicago River historically handled much of the region's <b>waterborne</b> cargo, today's huge lake freighters use the city's Lake Calumet Harbor on the South Side. The lake also provides another positive effect, moderating Chicago's climate; making waterfront neighborhoods slightly warmer in winter and cooler in summer.|$|E
