40|$|Objective Although {{body image}} {{disturbance}} (BID) {{is considered a}} core symptom in anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN), {{little is known about}} its psychopathological correlates. The present study aimed at analysing the correlation of aspects of BID with psychopathological and temperamental characteristics. Method A sample of 1288 patients (538 AN and 750 BN) were assessed through a structured diagnostic interview, the Eating Disorders Inventory and Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire. Cognition of body image distortion, <b>weight</b> <b>checking,</b> fear of weight gain and body dissatisfaction were assessed by specific questions during the interview. Results Various aspects of BID formed similar, but not identical, dimensions in AN and BN. In both groups, anticipatory anxiety and interoceptive awareness were significantly and independently associated with body image distortion, whereas ineffectiveness was associated with <b>weight</b> <b>checking.</b> Discussion Body image disturbance is a multidimensional characteristic linked to psychological features, such as anticipatory anxiety, ineffectiveness and interoceptive awareness. These findings have scientific and treatment implications, and should be considered by clinicians in adopting successful treatment strategies...|$|E

40|$|The main {{principle}} of all industry is that “time is money”. This senior project focuses on reducing operation times for Specialty Silicone Fabricators (SSFab) materials weighing station. Currently SSFab {{is set up}} so that multiple operators check the weights of materials. This is done to guarantee {{the accuracy of the}} readings and maintain tight quality control. This project will focus on eliminating the need of multiple weight checkers as a way to save time and ultimately save money. Through detailed research and studies it has been determined that the most appropriate solution to this problem is a <b>weight</b> <b>checking</b> software that can incorporated into SSFab’s existing hardware. The software will serve as a quality checkpoint with is capable of verifying and storing weight readings. The use of this software will eliminate the need of any extra operators. Given the nature of the project {{it was not possible to}} obtain the software/hardware necessary to do any statistical testing. However, detailing testing criteria has been laid out for SSFab’s use when the time comes for them to move forward with these recommendations. The resulting times and data can be compared against existing time studies to show the reductions and time and the subsequent savings...|$|E

5000|$|On December 17, {{terms were}} finally agreed {{and it was}} officially {{announced}} that the fight would take place at Madison Square Garden in New York City on March 18, 2017 exclusively on HBO PPV. Golovkin tweeted the announcement via whilst Jacobs uploaded a quick video on social media. At {{the time of the}} fight, both fighters had a combined 35 consecutive knockouts. It was reported that Golovkin's IBO world title would not be at stake. The IBO website later confirmed the belt would be at stake. HBO officially announced the fight on December 22, being billed as [...] "Middleweight Madness". Loeffler confirmed there was no rematch clause in place. Ultimately, the IBF title was not at stake for Jacobs because he skipped a fight-day <b>weight</b> <b>check.</b> Unlike the other major sanctioning bodies, the IBF requires participants in title fights to submit to a <b>weight</b> <b>check</b> {{on the morning of the}} fight, as well as the official weigh-in the day before the fight; at the morning <b>weight</b> <b>check,</b> they can weigh no more than 10 lb above the fight's weight limit.|$|R

5000|$|During this period, the Formula One rules {{specified}} that any car must weigh at least 585 kg {{to be deemed}} {{in compliance with the}} rules. The method of testing was somewhat haphazard - teams would be notified that they would be [...] "weight checked" [...] when they exited the pits during practice or qualifying. This gave the teams ample opportunity to add weight to their cars while in the pits so as to pass the test. Former Formula One driver Eddie Cheever claimed that during 1981, when his Tyrrell was tagged for a <b>weight</b> <b>check</b> in qualifying, the team took off the [...] "racing" [...] rear wing (a fiberglass/metal hybrid) and replaced it with a [...] "weight check" [...] rear wing before allowing him to proceed to the scale.

5000|$|The {{traditional}} [...] "minimum weight" [...] {{system where}} weights below a specified weight are rejected.

40|$|Traffic {{accidents}} involving heavy trucks have {{social and economic}} effects on society. However, little {{research has focused on}} the influence of heavy truck specifications such as weight. Apportioning the maximum permissible gross weight of trucks allows trucking companies/owners to consolidate loads, and therefore reduce the vehicle-kilometres required to collect and distribute a given amount of goods/material. While drivers/managers are responsible for ensuring that trucks are loaded appropriately and in compliance with regulations, some may take chances and overload vehicles. This increases the need for formal and documented inspections, in order to reduce traffic hazards on public roads due to overweight loading. According to a New South Wales Centre for Road Safety report in 2014, crashes involving heavy trucks often result in serious road trauma outcomes. When a heavy truck is involved in a crash, the vehicle mass raises the crash forces involved and hence increases the severity of the crash. Therefore, interventions should be established to mitigate or prevent these crashes from occurring. Currently, <b>weight</b> <b>checks</b> are required for trucks and truck drivers must drive to a weighbridge for a <b>weight</b> <b>check.</b> Since this is a random process, truck drivers may take the risk of driving an over-loaded truck on some occasions. This paper reviews existing studies concerning safe system interventions in relation to truck gross weight management and a framework is presented to effectively manage truck loading weight. The result may be a reduction of injuries and fatalities involving heavy trucks...|$|R
