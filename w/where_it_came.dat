5|$|By early 1944, No.9 Operational Group {{had become}} a static {{garrison}} force for the New Guinea area, and was renamed Northern Command in April to better reflect its new role. The following month No.71 Wing, now led by Wing Commander Ralph Moran, advanced to Nadzab, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> {{under the control of}} No.10 Operational Group (later the Australian First Tactical Air Force). There Nos.8 and 100 Squadrons engaged in attacks on Japanese positions in Wewak, each flying over 140 sorties during the month.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{destruction}} of the majority of NY37B, the route was realigned west of Massena to follow a new riverside roadway to the hamlet of Louisville Corner, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> to an end at NY37. The remainder of NY37B along the Massena–Louisville town line road and in Massena was unchanged. By 1960, a connector between NY37 in Louisville and NY37B and Massena utilizing NY37's former routing west of the village was designated as NY131. The alignments of NY37B and NY131 west of the Maple Street/ Town Line Road intersection were flipped , placing NY131 on the riverside and town line roads and NY37B on NY37's former routing into Massena.|$|E

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave emerged off {{the west}} coast of Africa on September 23, and merged with the southern end of a decaying frontal system over the Caribbean Sea. The combined disturbance gradually split, with the northernmost section eventually becoming Tropical Storm Marco. The southernmost end moved into the eastern Pacific, which then immediately showed signs of organization. The system stalled just south of El Salvador throughout October 5, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> under the influence of strong vertical wind shear. The circulation slowly drifted east-northeastward and became absorbed by a neighboring tropical wave, with the broad resultant low re-curving to the west-northwest. In response to relaxing shear aloft, convection redeveloped around the newly formed center of circulation. It subsequently acquired a sufficiently organized structure and post-analysis found that a tropical depression formed at around 1200UTC on October8. Upon developing, the depression was designated as Sixteen-E about 120mi (195km) south-southwest of San Salvador, El Salvador, and operationally, advisories were initiated at 2100UTC — 9 hours after post-analytic estimates of formation.|$|E
5|$|No. 82 Wing {{moved to}} its present {{location}} at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, in 1946, <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> {{under the control}} of the RAAF's Eastern Area Command. In May that year, No.482 (Maintenance) Squadron was formed from No.4 Repair and Servicing Unit, to be responsible for repair and upkeep of the wing's aircraft. Its flying complement now included Nos.12 (formerly of No.85 Wing), 21, and 23 Squadrons, but these were renumbered Nos.1, 2 and 6 Squadrons respectively in February 1948. At the same time, the wartime Liberators were replaced by Avro Lincoln heavy bombers. During 1949–50, some of the Lincolns were specially modified with advanced radar and other instrumentation to participate in Operation Cumulative, a joint program with the Royal Air Force gathering long-range navigation and bombing data for use in potential air campaigns against the Soviet Union.|$|E

25|$|In {{the morning}} of 18 July 2013 at 8:20a.m. (2320 GMT) small amounts of steam escaped from the reactor building. Video images made by a subcontractor, filming the {{destroyed}} building and preparing to remove rubble from the place, showed some vapors rising, but it was unclear <b>where</b> <b>it</b> <b>came</b> from. Although there was {{no change in the}} afternoon, TEPCO said that radiation levels did not change, and the reactor was still cooled. According to TEPCO rain could have found its way to the primary containment of the reactor, and because this vessel was still hot, it could cause the steam.|$|E

The oldest archaeological peach stones are from the Kuahuqiao site. Archaeologists point at the Yangzi River valley as the place where the early selection for favorable peach varieties likely took place.|$|E
