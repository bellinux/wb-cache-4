One of the main factors which causes the <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> the students <b>comprehension</b> toward polyhedral material is spatial ability. This study aims at describing error occurred in the students based on NEA viewed from spatial ability.

The subjects of research were the semester VIII graders of SMPN 2 Kebonagung in academic year of 2013 / 2014, there were 12 students who have hight spatial ability, 11 students who have medium spatial ability and 11 students who have low spatial ability. The sampling technique used was purposive sampling. The data were taken from the result of error diagnostic test which was followed by Certainly of Response Index (CRI) scores, spatial test and interview. The validity of data used triangulation techniques. The data was analyzed by using Miles and Huberman 2 ̆ 7 s model.

40|$|Background. The Neale Analysis of Reading Ability (NARA; Neale, 1997) is {{a widely}} used {{assessment}} <b>of</b> reading <b>comprehension</b> and word reading accuracy. Spooner, Baddeley, and Gathercole (2004) questioned the suitability of the NARA for identifying children with specific reading comprehension deficits. Aims and methods. An evaluation of the NARA measurement of word reading and reading comprehension level was undertaken in relation to models of reading ability. Appropriate control measures were considered. The strengths and <b>weaknesses</b> <b>of</b> different forms <b>of</b> reading <b>comprehension</b> were also evaluated. Results. Previous research into reading comprehension difficulties using the NARA has adopted satisfactory control measures in relation to word reading ability. There are limitations associated with all the considered forms <b>of</b> reading <b>comprehension</b> assessment. Conclusions. If administered and interpreted appropriately, the NARA is an effective instrument for researchers and practitioners who need to assess both word reading accuracy and reading comprehension and to identify children with a dissociation between these two aspects of reading.

40|$|A {{procedure}} is described for rescaling objective measures <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> {{so that they}} reflect amounts <b>of</b> accuracy <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> on an absolute scale. The {{procedure is}} based upon rauding theory, a theory that interrelates reading ability, passage difficulty, reading time, and passage <b>comprehension.</b> The validity <b>of</b> the rescaling procedure is dependent upon one primary assump-tion—that {{the relationship between the}} objective measure <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> and the theoretical construct, accuracy <b>of</b> <b>comprehension,</b> is linear. The rescaling procedure was evaluated and illustrated by application to previously collected data. Four different measures <b>of</b> passage <b>comprehension</b> ad-ministered subsequent to reading yielded drastically different "percent com-prehension " scores—the average of all the errors among the measures at each rate was 15 %. However, when the four measures were rescaled, all four pro-vided accuracy <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> scores which were more similar—the cor-responding average of all these errors was only 6 %.

40|$|International audienceThe papers {{presented}} in this special issue highlight three theoretical topics central to the reading comprehension research. The first relates to the component skills <b>of</b> reading <b>comprehension</b> performance. Among the multiple linguistic and cognitive skills involved, vocabulary retained much of the researchers' attention. Three papers described the influence of vocabulary on various aspects <b>of</b> <b>comprehension.</b> The second topic {{is tied to the}} assessment <b>of</b> reading <b>comprehension</b> and the analysis of individual differences. Despite the multidimensional nature <b>of</b> the reading <b>comprehension</b> process, most assessment tools provide a single measure of performance. Four papers focused on analyzing the specific dimensions <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> being assessed by existing and novel tests. The third topic is relevant to the teaching <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> and the prevention <b>of</b> reading <b>comprehension</b> difficulties.

Methods: In this cross-sectional study, a Likert scale was used {{to assess the}} participants’ level <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> <b>of</b> the postpartum instructions provided by the nursing staff at a maternity ward of a teaching hospital in southern Brazil. Results: A total of 196 women were interviewed.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} {{contributions}} of metacognitive and self-regulated learning theories to research on students' calibration <b>of</b> <b>comprehension.</b> Historically, cognitive psychologists have studied calibration <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> within a purely metacognitive framework, {{with an emphasis on}} the role of text and task factors but little consideration of factors of self. There has been a recent trend, however, towards incorporating a social cognitive perspective to the study <b>of</b> calibration <b>of</b> <b>comprehension,</b> with factors <b>of</b> self such as motivation and affect being examined more often. Among the factors of self that have been examined, self-efficacy has played a major role as it may be all but impossible to disentangle its influence on students' calibration <b>of</b> <b>comprehension.</b> Other variables <b>of</b> self that have been examined include ability, familiarity, ego and goal-orientation, goal setting, personality traits and susceptibility to social and cultural influences. Broadening the context in which calibration <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> is assessed allows a more complete examination of the rich set of interrelated processes that affect students' performance...|$|R

40|$|The main {{question}} discussed in current {{debates about the}} epistemology of testimony concerns whether the justification of testimonial beliefs is inferential or non-inferential. This thesis offers a novel argument for inferentialism, the former view. It does so through, firstly, assuming a widely shared view about the psychology <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> – the inferential model of communication – along with widely shared views about the epistemic basing relation and inferential justification, and then, secondly, arguing that inferentialism in the epistemology <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> - the view that (i) comprehension states are beliefs, and (ii) that the justification of such states is inferential - follows from these assumptions. It is then argued that inferentialism in the epistemology of testimony follows from inferentialism in the epistemology <b>of</b> <b>comprehension.</b> Through offering this argument, the thesis aims to demonstrate that our views about the psychology <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> have far-reaching consequences for our theorizing {{in the fields of}} epistemology of testimony and epistemology <b>of</b> <b>comprehension.</b> In fact, widely held such views arguably have as a consequence that neither testimony nor <b>comprehension</b> are sources <b>of</b> non-inferential justification, an important epistemological insight...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The study aims {{to explore}} the use of {{alternative}} measures of 2 ̆ 2 understandability 2 ̆ 2 on accounting texts. This includes the meaning identification test (MIT) and the sentence verification technique (SVT), which have not previously been used by accounting researchers, as well as variants on the traditional Cloze tests such as the C-Test. Design/methodology/approach: This study focuses on the understandability of accounting texts and evaluates how reliable the Cloze test is as a measure <b>of</b> <b>comprehension.</b> An experiment was designed and conducted to measure users 2 ̆ 7 performance with a variety <b>of</b> <b>comprehension</b> measures (MIT, SVT, Cloze, C-Test). Findings: The study concludes that the outcomes from the MIT and SVT comprehension tests are not significantly associated with those from the Cloze tests. This implies that while the Cloze test is a good measure of the predictability of accounting narratives, and of textual redundancy, {{it does not necessarily}} measure the understandability of the text. Originality/value: These measures of understandability, which have not previously been used in accounting, would enable researchers to test the communicational effectiveness of using different accounting narratives such as annual reports or prospectuses. Such a measure could be used to improve the understandability of accounting narratives. The strengths and <b>weaknesses</b> <b>of</b> the various tests are assessed.
