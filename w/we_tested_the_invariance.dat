We systematically examined Caucasian (n = 3, 767) versus non-Caucasian race (n = 2, 824) and Hispanic (n = 2, 395) versus non-Hispanic ethnicity (n = 3, 853) as candidate moderators of PTSD 2 ̆ 7 s 5 -factor model structural parameters (Elhai et al., 2013).

40|$|Abstract. <b>We</b> <b>test</b> <b>the</b> <b>invariance</b> of <b>the</b> “full model ” of {{self-control}} using {{a sample of}} white and American Indian high school students. American Indians in our sample reported significantly lesser parenting, lower self-control, {{and higher levels of}} vandalism and personal offending, but not property offending. Race-specific regressions find that parenting significantly influenced self-control for white respondents only—not American Indians. Self-control significantly influenced all three forms of delinquency for each race. Parenting significantly predicted property offending and vandalism for each race, but failed to predict personal offending for either. Z-tests on the various influences revealed no significant differences by race, {{with the exception of the}} influence of parenting on vandalism. These findings provide support for <b>the</b> <b>invariance</b> of <b>the</b> full model {{of self-control}} but suggest that the influence of parenting on American Indian delinquency is somewhat different from whites. We also discuss our findings relative to the mediation effect of self-control on the parenting/delinquency relationship...|$|R

40|$|Rates of {{international}} migration are increasing, {{which raises the}} question of how migration might influence couple relationship standards and impact on the standards of migrants forming intercultural relationships. We compared relationship standards in n =  286 Chinese living in Hong Kong, China, with standards in n =  401 Chinese migrants to a Western country (Australia) by administering the Chinese-Western Intercultural Couple Standards Scale (CWICSS). We also compared these two groups to n =  312 Westerners living in Australia. <b>We</b> first <b>tested</b> <b>the</b> structural <b>invariance</b> of <b>the</b> CWICSS across the three samples with a multigroup confirmatory factor analysis. There was marginal but acceptable fit of a model of two positively correlated latent factors: Couple Bond (with four indicators, such as demonstration of love and caring) and Family Responsibility (also with four indicators, such as extended family relations and preserving face). Within the limitations of the study, results suggest migration is associated predominantly with differences in women 2 ̆ 7 s, but not men 2 ̆ 7 s, relationship standards. Migrant Chinese women show alignment of Couple Bond standards with Western standards, and divergence of Family Responsibility standards from Western standards.

Exploration of the latent structure of this instrument resulted in conflicting evidence. This study {{aimed to explore}} the latent structure of SRQ- 20 among Brazilian women from community settings. <b>We</b> also <b>tested</b> <b>the</b> model <b>invariance</b> across different sociodemographic conditions. Methods: Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted on a sample of 1668 women from four different geographical regions of Brazil. <b>Invariance</b> of <b>the</b> model was <b>tested</b> through multi-group CFA according to sociodemographic variables. Results: EFA has shown two potential solutions with two and three factors. CFA resulted in indices of the two-factor solution slightly worse than <b>the</b> three-factor solution. <b>Invariance</b> <b>testing</b> has shown this model was not invariant across cities, but was invariant across different social classes. the structure was also invariant for the two lower educated groups. the respecifled model (i. e., excluding item 16) was not invariant across groups with different educational levels. Conclusion: the three-factor solution {{seems to be the}} most suitable model of SRQ- 20 for Brazilian women in community settings. Furthermore, sociodemographic variables seem to reflect on the latent structure of this instrument. Validation of screening tools should consider sociodemographic variables. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

First-order four-factor models, including the latent factors of sport competence, physical conditioning, body attractiveness and physical strength, demonstrated good-fit with the data both for competence and importance factors.
