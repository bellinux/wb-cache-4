50|$|Civil law notaries have {{jurisdiction}} over strictly non-contentious domestic civil-private {{law in the}} areas of property law, family law, agency, <b>wills</b> <b>and</b> <b>succession,</b> and company formation. The point to which a country's notarial profession monopolizes these areas can vary greatly. On one extreme is France (and French-derived systems) which statutorily give notaries a monopoly over their reserved areas of practice, as opposed to Austria where there is no discernible monopoly whatsoever and notaries are in direct competition with attorneys/solicitors.|$|E

50|$|Up to 1868 wills of {{immovables}} {{were not}} allowed under Scots law. The usual means of obtaining disposition of heritage after death was a trust disposition and settlement by deed de praesenti, under which the truster disposed the property to trustees according to the trusts of the settlement, reserving a life interest. Thus something very similar to a testamentary disposition was secured by means resembling those employed in England before the Wills Act of Henry VIII. The main disadvantage of the trust disposition {{was that it was}} liable to be overthrown by the heir, who could reduce ex capite lecti all voluntary deeds made to his prejudice within sixty days of the death of his ancestor. In 1868 the Titles to Land Consolidation Act made it competent to any owner of lands to settle the succession to the same in the event of death by testamentary or mortis causa deeds or writings. In 1871 reduction ex capite lecti was abolished. A will of immovables must be executed with the formalities of a deed and registered to give title. The disability of a woman as a witness was removed by the Titles to Land Consolidation Act. As to wills of movables, there arc several important points in which they differ from corresponding wills in England, the influence of Roman law being more marked. Males may make a will at fourteen, females at twelve. A nuncupative legacy is good to the amount of £100 Scots (£8, 6s. 8d.), and a holograph testament is good without witnesses, but it must be signed by the testator, differing in this from the old English holograph. By the Conveyancing Act 1874 such a will is presumed to have been executed on the date which it bears. Not all movables can be left, as in England. The movable property of the deceased is subject to jus relictae and legitime. See McLaren, <b>Wills</b> <b>and</b> <b>Succession,</b> for the law, and Judicial Styles for styles.|$|E
40|$|Studies have {{suggested}} that the large net worth disparity between whites and African Americans is mostly accounted for by the different patterns in which the two groups accumulate family assets. Inheritances and other intentional wealth transfers account for a large portion of American household wealth. Despite this fact, a recent survey reported that 55 % of all adult Americans and 67 % of African Americans do not have a succession plan, as evidenced by basic wills. This paper attempted to identify reasons behind the disproportionately large number of African Americans who die intestate and leave their assets behind as heir property, a potential source of evaporation of wealth transferable from generation to generation. The paper explored the underlying practices, assumptions, expectations, or beliefs that contribute to the high prevalence of intestate death within the African American community, using interviews and survey instruments. We assumed that ignorance of concepts associated with <b>wills</b> <b>and</b> <b>succession</b> planning was a contributor to the high intestate death within the community. Our findings contradict the assumption that the large number of African Americans who die intestate leaving their assets as heir property is due to lack of understanding of the terms associated with <b>wills</b> <b>and</b> <b>succession</b> planning. ...|$|E

40|$|The law of {{succession}} has been changed a lot by enacting the new Civil Code in many ways but its main purpose is still to regulate the succession of inheritance from testator to heirs and related problems. This thesis makes an analysis of testate succession, {{which is one of}} the three possibilities of inheritance succession. The second is an intestate succession, which applies in the situation, when testator did not wrote last will. The last possibility is a contract between testator and heirs distributing inheritance between the latter. This contract has bigger legal force than last <b>will</b> <b>and</b> intestate <b>succession</b> is used, if there is none of them. The thesis consists of five chapters. Chapter One provides a brief introduction to history of the law {{of succession}} in our territory and presents the purpose of the thesis. Chapter Two deals with the questions common to the whole {{law of succession}}, it is divided in three subchapters, which talk about the main principles of the law of <b>succession</b> <b>and</b> legal rules regulating it and also about preconditions of succession, which include death of testator, subjective law of succession, existence of inheritance and legal ground to the succession. It also names possibility of heirs to reject inheritance. Chapter Three is concerned with the main theme of the thesis, which is [...] ...|$|R
40|$|More {{intensive}} {{removal of}} woody biomass for the bio-economy <b>will</b> disrupt litter <b>and</b> <b>succession</b> cycles. Especially at risk is {{the retention of}} fine and coarse woody debris (FWD and CWD), crucial factors in forest biodiversity and nutrient cycling. However, to what extent CWD affects soil functioning remains unknown, and is seldom considered. From 32 paired test–reference points in eight Fagus sylvatica (L.) stands throughout Southwest Germany, CWD significantly increased soil C/N ratios, base saturation, and possibly pH. CWD-induced changes in soil porosity, available water capacity, and total organic carbon depended on site and CWD characteristics. As such, CWD {{can be viewed as}} a “pedogenic hot-spot” of concentrated biogeochemical and -physical processes with outsized effects on soil functioning and development. CWD management for soil functioning should consider site and tree species specific volume thresholds, timed rotations, and spatial densities, but appropriate implementation requires further research to define best management practices. If successful, overall forest resilience as well as soil functioning and productivity can be improved...|$|R

Among the bills was modernization of insurance and inheritance laws with the Insurance Amendment Act, 2009 <b>and</b> the <b>Wills,</b> Estates <b>and</b> <b>Succession</b> Act. The Labour Mobility Act enacted portions of the Trade, Investment and Labour Mobility Agreement. In light of the ongoing Braidwood Inquiry, Kash Heed, the Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General, introduced the Police (Misconduct, Complaints, Investigations, Discipline and Proceedings) Amendment Act which increased the Office of the Police Complaint Commissioner's ability to investigate public complaints against police, though the bill was criticized for perpetuating [...] "cops investigating cops" [...] investigations rather than implementing civilian oversight. Heed also sponsored the Motor Vehicle Amendment Act, 2009 which banned the use of cell phones while driving (except {{with the use of}} hands-free technology) and the Body Armour Control Act which introduced the requirement for permits and licensing for the sale and ownership of body armour. To help cope with the pine beetle epidemic, the Minister of Forests and Range Pat Bell introduced the Wood First Act, which required that all new provincially funded buildings use wood as the primary building material and increased the maximum height for wood structures from four storeys to six in the Building Code. The Protected Areas of British Columbia Amendment Act, 2009 created the Skaha Bluffs Provincial Park near Penticton and the Det san Ecological Reserve near Smithers.|$|R
