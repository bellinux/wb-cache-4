50|$|A <b>waveshaper</b> {{is a body}} (typically a disc or {{cylindrical}} block) of an {{inert material}} (typically solid or foamed plastic, but sometimes metal, perhaps hollow) inserted within the explosive {{for the purpose of}} changing the path of the detonation wave. The effect is to modify the collapse of the cone and resulting jet formation, with the intent of increasing penetration performance. Waveshapers are often used to save space; a shorter charge with a <b>waveshaper</b> can achieve the same performance as a longer charge without a <b>waveshaper.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mathematically, the {{operation}} {{is defined by the}} <b>waveshaper</b> equationwhere f is the shaping function, x(t) is the input function, and a(t) is the index function, which in general may vary as a function of time. This parameter a is often used as a constant gain factor called the distortion index. In practice, the input to the <b>waveshaper,</b> x, is considered on -1,1 for digitally sampled signals, and f will be designed such that y is also on -1,1 to prevent unwanted clipping in software.|$|E

40|$|Although {{semiconductor}} devices have progressively replaced vacuum tubes {{in nearly all}} applications, vacuum-tube amplifiers are still in use by professional musicians due to their tonal characteristics.   Over the years, many different techniques have been proposed {{with the goal of}} reproducing the timbral characteristics of these circuits.   This paper presents a review on the methodologies  that have been used to emulate tube circuits  over the last 30 years for musical applications.   The first part of the paper introduces the basic principles of tube circuits, with a common cathode triode example.   The remainder of the paper reviews the tube sound simulation devices.   The first of these emulations used analog  operational amplifier circuits with the negative feedback designed to reproduce tube transfer. As DSP became more popular over the last decades for audio applications, efforts towards digital tube circuit simulation algorithms were initiated. Simulation of these devices are basically divided into linear models with digital filters that correspond to IIR analog filters and nonlinear digital models that corresponds to the tube circuit itself.   The simulation of the first is straightforward, normally accomplished by the use of FIR digital filters.   The last can be either accomplished approximation equations, that are known as digital <b>waveshapers</b> and their variants or by circuit derived techniques, such as the resolution of circuit ordinary differential equations solvers.   Wave digital filter models are also variants of circuit simulation techniques that are also treated in this paper.   The circuit derived techniques yield more precise simulations over the <b>waveshapers</b> but are always computationally more expensive so that a compromise between accuracy and  efficiency is needed for real-time simulation of these devices...|$|R

5000|$|The sound {{produced}} by digital <b>waveshapers</b> {{tends to be}} harsh and unattractive, because of problems with aliasing. Waveshaping is a non-linear operation, so it's hard to generalize {{about the effect of}} a waveshaping function on an input signal. The mathematics of non-linear operations on audio signals is difficult, and not well understood. The effect will be amplitude-dependent, among other things. But generally, waveshapers—particularly those with sharp corners (e.g., some derivatives are discontinuous) -- tend to introduce large numbers of high frequency harmonics. If these introduced harmonics exceed the nyquist limit, then they will be heard as harsh inharmonic content with a distinctly metallic sound in the output signal. Supersampling can somewhat but not completely alleviate this problem, depending on how fast the introduced harmonics fall off. Supersampling involves the following procedure: ...|$|R

50|$|A <b>waveshaper</b> is {{an audio}} effect that changes an audio signal by mapping an input {{signal to the}} output signal by {{applying}} a fixed or variable mathematical function, called the shaping function or transfer function, to the input signal (the term shaping function is preferred to avoid confusion with the transfer function from systems theory). The function can be any function at all.|$|E

The main aim of multiliner configuration is to develop tandem behavior and to increase the length of explosively formed projectile in different applications. The high ductility and high dynamic material behavior of Ta (Tantalum) {{makes it difficult to}} generate a solid and stable projectile. To get these specific characteristics, mild steel was used for being the most stable liner material in the EFP technology.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{an adaptive}} algorithm for constraining the amplitude of speech signals {{while at the}} same time trying to maintain the subjective loudness and trying not to produce disturbing artifacts. The algorithm can be applied to compensate for the clipping distortion of amplifiers in speech reproduction devices. The algorithm analyzes the speech signal on multiple frequency bands and applies an internal audibility law in order to make inaudible changes to the signal. An example of the audibility law, presented in the form of a matrix, is described, associated with a specific speech reproduction device. Multiple band-pass signals are processed with a <b>waveshaper</b> to accomplish soft-clipping and to constrain the amplitude of the processed signal.

40|$|Modern {{high-performance}} {{signal processing}} applications face constantly increasing processing speeds. The use of photonics potentially offers {{a much higher}} bandwidth and faster processing than what can be achieved in the electronic domain. This thesis investigates novel photonic techniques based on optical mixing for performing a correlation, a common signal processing task. The first photonic correlation scheme investigated uses four wave mixing (FWM) in a length of highly nonlinear fibre (HNLF) to mix template or reference wavelengths with a pump wavelength, which has been modulated by an input bit stream {{in order to produce}} copies of the input signal at the output idler wavelengths. The idler wavelengths are differentially delayed and summed at a photoreceiver to produce a correlation of the input bit stream and the reference bit pattern. This technique was investigated experimentally and results show that a correlation function is successfully achieved. A significant advantage of this technique compared to previous photonic correlation techniques is that modulation of the pump wavelength allows the “transmitter” to be remotely located, away from the correlation signal processing equipment. An extension of this technique successfully demonstrated the use of software control of the reference bit pattern using a multi-port photonic signal processor (<b>Waveshaper).</b> This enabled a more versatile form of correlator. True correlation requires the summation of negative signals. This is difficult for optical signals. A novel photonic technique based on FWM, which allows negative accumulation, was proposed for the first time. In this technique, a number of carrier and pump wavelengths are carefully selected such that individual mixing products occur at the same idler wavelength. Subtraction of optical fields at this wavelength can be achieved by changing the relative phase of pump wavelengths by 90  using a <b>Waveshaper</b> optical processor. This novel concept was verified via a simulation using ‘VPItransmissionMaker 9. 0 ’ software. The simulation demonstrated that negative accumulation of optical signals could be achieved for the first time. In summary, novel photonic correlation techniques based on nonlinear optical mixing in optical fibre have been demonstrated and subtraction of optical fields using FWM has been demonstrated for the first time...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{capability}} of measuring the spectral and temporal phase of an optical signal is of fundamental {{importance for the}} advanced characterization of photonic and optoelectronic components, biochemical sensors, structural monitoring sensors and distributed sensor networks. To address this problem, several techniques have been developed (frequency-resolved optical gating (FROG), spectral phase interferometry for direct electric-field reconstruction (SPIDER), stepped-heterodyne technique, laser Doppler vibrometry (LDV) and Doppler optical coherence tomography (OCT)). However, such techniques often lack of versatility for the mentioned applications. Swept-wavelength interferometric techniques and, among these, optical frequency-domain reflectometry (OFDR) are flexible and highly sensitive tools for complete characterization of amplitude and phase of target devices. In this work, we investigate the spectral and temporal phase measurement capabilities of OFDR. Precise characterization of spectral phase information is demonstrated by retrieving the phase response of a commercial optical filter, the Finisar <b>Waveshaper</b> 1000 S/X, programmable in attenuation and phase over C+L band (1530 - 1625 nm). The presented results show accurate retrieval of group delay dispersion (GDD) and discrete phase shift as well as filter attenuation profile. Although some intrinsic accuracy limitations of OFDR phase measurements may be encountered (and herein specified), we show that information encoded in OFDR reflectogram data is very rich when adequately exploited. In addition to previously published results, we demonstrate the high sensitivity of the technique to Doppler effects. From practical point of view, such sensitivity can be beneficially exploited for the characterisation of dynamical aspects of samples under test. Unlike LDV, OFDR allows the simultaneous retrieval of the temporal position of several localised reflecting target along the beam path. All these aspects make OFDR a highly promising candidate {{for the study of}} both static and dynamic aspects of complex photonic components or to probe a parallel sensor network, as needed for future application...|$|E
