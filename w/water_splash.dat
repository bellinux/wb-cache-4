The heavy crib structure supported the dam's face and the weight of the <b>water.</b> <b>Splash</b> dams were timber crib dams used to help float logs downstream in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|E

With the development of steam heating jackets around the cylinders of engines such as the trunk engine, the exhaust from this source, again unlubricated, could be condensed.|$|E

40|$|Experiments {{were done}} to {{investigate}} the influence of drop diameter on {{the efficiency of the}} splash process, using a rain tower and different types of target (glass, water films, healthy and/or diseased oilseed rape leaves and tobacco leaves) and different target configurations. For horizontal glass plates, random variability in the mass of <b>water</b> <b>splashed</b> was 3 - 4 times greater for dry targets than for wet targets and considerably more <b>water</b> was <b>splashed</b> from wet targets. The effect of target angle was greater for large drops and the greatest amount of <b>water</b> was <b>splashed</b> from horizontal targets. More <b>water</b> was <b>splashed</b> from oilseed rape leaves than tobacco leaves. Both spore suspensions and surfactant in target liquids decreased the mean volume of <b>water</b> <b>splashed</b> and increased its variability. A power law described the relationship between drop diameter and mass of <b>water</b> <b>splashed</b> per incident drop for drops falling from a height of 11 m onto targets of different types. Using results obtained with incident drops falling from heights of 11 or 1. 5 m there was no unique relationship between mass of <b>water</b> <b>splashed</b> and kinetic energy, momentum or impact force. A simulation study, which calculated splash efficiency of single drops on leaves, illustrated the importance of leaf characteristics when assessing rain-splash potential, and more generally when developing methodology to describe the influence of crop structure on the dispersal of spores by splash.

50|$|The <b>Water</b> <b>Splashing</b> ceremony, however, is {{more than}} just good-natured fun; it also {{contains}} a religious element: water is regarded by the Dai as a symbol, firstly, of religious purity, but also of goodwill among people.

60|$|There is a {{movement}} in the stern; the profound stillness is suddenly broken by a frightful roar: M-wah-úh! M-waah-úh! M-w-wã-a-ã-ã-a! The echoes rouse themselves swiftly, and rush away confused and broken, to and fro across the lake. As they die away among the hills there is a sound from the canoe as if an animal were walking in shallow <b>water,</b> <b>splash,</b> splash, splash, klop! then silence again, that is not dead, but listening.|$|E
60|$|Presently he {{went out}} to look at the weather. The rain had stopped and low mist hung about, but a {{half-moon}} was rising in a patch of clear sky. The swell heaved, long and smooth, about the sloop, which swung up and down with a regular motion. Jimmy could see the yacht’s anchor light not far away and the yellow blink from her saloon windows, but he could hear nothing that suggested preparations for sending off a boat. As it was cold in the cockpit, he returned to the cabin, where the others had lighted the lamp, and none of them said much for the next hour. They could hear the loose halyards slap the mast and the <b>water</b> <b>splash</b> about beneath the floorings, and the soft lapping of the tide along the planking.|$|E
60|$|He went out, and Frank heard a {{clatter of}} blocks and flutter of canvas. After {{that there was}} a sharp {{rattling}} as Harry hauled in the anchor chain, and then the boat suddenly slanted over with a jerk which flung Frank backward against the side of her. As he got up he heard the <b>water</b> <b>splash</b> about her bows. A few minutes later they began to swing sharply up and down, and the thuds against them made it evident that the sloop was plunging close-hauled through a short, head sea. By and by the plunges grew more violent, and struggling into his clothes, which were partly dry, Frank put out the lamp and crawled out into the well. For a minute or two he could see nothing as he held on by the weather coaming, though he felt the buffeting of the wind and the sting of the spray upon his face. Then by degrees he made out that the sloop was lying down on one side, with the small black strip of her double-reefed mainsail slanting sharply above her, and a filmy white cloud flying at her bows. Suddenly the frothing water began to glitter, and on looking up he saw that the moon, which had grown brighter, had just emerged from behind a bank of flying cloud. Then Harry who sat at the helm called to him.|$|E
