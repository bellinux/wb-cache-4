50|$|Together {{with the}} alien grandfather, Scrooge has such fun reliving his younger {{days in the}} Yukon that he is torn between two choices - go back to Earth {{with family and friends}} or stay in space and have the {{adventure}} of his life. This dilemma is cut abruptly short when an alien police patrol appears, having come after the unlicensed <b>warp</b> <b>speed</b> device that was the root cause of the whole adventure. The police are decidedly unfriendly to ugly, evil aliens such as the ducks, so the ducks take the <b>warp</b> <b>speed</b> device back into the Money Bin and flee back to Earth.|$|R

50|$|Many {{of these}} DOSes were {{released}} by manufacturers of third-party drives, anyone who made drive modifications, or {{anyone who was}} dissatisfied with the available DOSes. Often, these DOSes could read disks in higher densities, and could set the drive to read disks faster (using <b>Warp</b> <b>Speed</b> or Ultra-Speed techniques). Most of these DOSes (except SpartaDOS) were DOS 2.0 compatible.|$|R
50|$|The game can {{be played}} either in time trial or arcade mode. The music in the {{background}} matches the gameplay with its electronica genre. Races are quite brief and usually last between 15 and 45 seconds.

50|$|This {{program was}} {{included}} with the <b>Warp</b> <b>Speed</b> Software. It allowed transferring files {{back and forth between}} an Atari and an IBM disk using a Happy enhanced 1050 drive. Because the 1050 was a single sided drive with only one head, the disk had to be formatted as SS (180K). The IBM disk could even be formatted on the 1050 drive.|$|R

50|$|Ship-mounted phasers have {{a similar}} range of {{functions}} on a larger scale: The phasers on the USS Enterprise {{could be used as}} an 'anti-missile' defense to destroy incoming projectiles, stun entire city blocks full of people, destroy cities, and even destroy entire asteroids up to a given size. The ship's phaser system was also said to be capable of destroying continents. Starship phasers can be freely used while the ship is travelling at <b>Warp</b> <b>speeds.</b>|$|R
5000|$|While at <b>warp</b> <b>speed,</b> a huge alien vessel overtakes and {{swallows}} Enterprise, disabling the ship's {{engines and}} weapons.

While EV Tucker is visibly [...] "entered" [...] {{by one of the}} beings before being returned to his normal state. Doctor Phlox's examination, however, reveals no lingering effects.|$|R

40|$|Extract: The {{group was}} {{returning}} from their morning tea break. I needed {{a process to}} help them get inside the content, to engage with it, to explore the relevance to their own work. As they sat down I still had no idea what I was going to do. They looked at me expectantly. My mind was racing at <b>warp</b> <b>speed,</b> which wasn’t helping much! Then I remembered three of the key tenets of improv: Do something! Start anywhere! Be average! So I did – and it worked...|$|R
50|$|Reptyl {{later became}} Reptyl Prime {{as a result}} of genetic mutation.

He resembles a 15+1/2 ft mythological dragon with grey scaly ridged hide, sharpened teeth and 6 in claws, bat-like wings wingspan, and a 7 ft spiked tail. Reptyl Prime also gained the ability to manipulate cosmic energy in the form of concussive blasts of cosmic force, and the ability to exist in space unprotected.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{contrast}} to the usual graphical representation of the visual appearance of a star field in science fiction movies with its elongated stars, the actual view of such a star field as seen from within a warp bubble is completely different. To demonstrate what could be really seen, we have developed a Java application with which the user can travel through {{the stars of the}} Hipparcos catalogue either with relativistic speeds in the Minkowskian spacetime or with <b>warp</b> <b>speed</b> in the Alcubierre metric. The Java application is freely available a...|$|R
40|$|Imaged-based {{rendering}} is {{a well-known}} method in computer graphics to achieve photo-realistic images. In this paper we show how conventional image-based rendering algorithms can be extended to visualize general relativistic effects in a restricted class of spacetimes. We propose a generalized aberration formula in order to treat the visualization of special and general relativistic effects on the same footing. In this way, image-based general relativistic rendering {{can be regarded as}} an extension of special relativistic rendering. As an example, we present snapshots from the viewpoint of an observer traveling at <b>warp</b> <b>speed...</b>|$|R

That's us in a nutshell. We're drawn to each by what each of us lacks. The story of this film is about two guys who are such opposites that they might end up strangling each other but instead they bond and thrive together. That's us. We can go <b>warp</b> <b>speed</b> together." [...] Roberto Orci on the film's emotional context.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first half}} of the novel {{involves}} three parallel arcs. In one arc, Zefram Cochrane has just completed the first <b>warp</b> <b>speed</b> voyage, a solo journey to Alpha Centauri and back. His is the first successful manned flight beyond the Sol system. His benefactor and backer, Micah Brack, exploits the warp drive to help humanity burst into the stars and safeguard the future of the race, which he foresees disaster for because of the [...] "Optimum Movement", perfectionists who are trying to perfect Khan Noonien Singh's failed attempt to unify and improve humanity.|$|R
50|$|Enterprise is {{investigating}} the first human deep-space colony — Terra Nova, nine years away from Earth at early <b>warp</b> <b>speed.</b> The colony had not been heard from in the last 70 years, following a disagreement with Earth regarding further colony ships. Captain Archer, Ensign Mayweather, Lieutenant Reed, and Sub-Commander T'Pol take a shuttlepod down to the surface, where they find a ghost town and radiation {{that would have been}} lethal seventy years earlier. Reed then detects a humanoid and gives chase, arriving at a cave entrance — inside Archer and Reed make first contact, but Reed is soon shot and captured.|$|R
50|$|Aliyah engages her ship to <b>warp</b> <b>speed</b> {{inside the}} planet's atmosphere, which destroys the planet, {{as well as}} its star and all ships in orbit. Jean Grey saves the Starjammer by manifesting the Phoenix Force. This {{discharge}} is noted by several parties: Scott and Emma Summers, their four children; Rachel Grey, campaign manager for Kitty Pryde's Chicago mayoral election campaign; Professor X; Cable; Wolverine and Storm, living in a house in Kenya; and Mister Sinister who notes that all the pieces are finally back on the board to allow him to restart his plans for world domination.|$|R

During this mission, Odo develops an apparently inexplicable fascination with the Omarion Nebula. The crew are at first successful with the new cloaking device in evading Dominion patrols, although Jem'Hadar vessels seem capable of detecting something while the Defiant travels at <b>warp</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|R
