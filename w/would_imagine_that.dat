25|$|Philip was a 38-year-old {{professional}} man {{referred to}} the author's clinic for assessment....Philip began masturbating at puberty, which occurred at age 12 or 13. The earliest sexual fantasy he could recall was that of having a woman's body. When he masturbated, he <b>would</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> he was a nude woman lying alone in her bed. His mental imagery would focus on his breasts, his vagina, the softness of his skin, and so on—all the characteristic features of the female physique. This remained his favorite sexual fantasy throughout his life.|$|E
2500|$|Shuho Sato, {{who wrote}} Umizaru and Say Hello to Black Jack, has created some {{controversy}} on Twitter. Sato says, [...] "Manga school is meaningless because those schools have very low success rates. Then, I could teach novices required skills {{on the job}} in three months. Meanwhile, those school students spend several million yen, and four years, yet they are good for nothing." [...] and that, [...] "For instance, Keiko Takemiya, the then professor of Seika Univ., remarked in the Government Council that 'A complete novice {{will be able to}} understand where is [...] "Tachikiri" [...] (i.e., margin section) during four years.' On the other hand, I <b>would</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that,</b> It takes about thirty minutes to completely understand that at work." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 6.82 {{million people}} watched the episode. Coupled with that night's episode of King of the Hill, it won its {{hour in the}} 18-49 demographic. Since airing, the episode has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. Rene Rosa of UGO wrote: [...] "When the self-referential jokes about the episode’s switch to HD were {{the things that made}} me laugh the most, and they last only a few seconds, I realized something was not good. This may be 'The Sharpest. Episode. Ever.' but is definitely not the funniest. Still, there are some genuinely endearing bitter-sweet moments in the episode, [...] but still it’s not enough to drive the show into the un-chartable funny waters that it used to live in." [...] Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club wrote: [...] "If it seems like there's a lot going on, that's because there is. The episode could have easily been just one thing—Homer deals with his Vance inferiority complex, or he sets out to discover the truth of the election from the former principal, or it could have been entirely a flashback episode. But instead, The Simpsons tries to do all three, one for each commercial break. The show has been around for 20 years; I <b>would</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> there would be plenty to mine from digging deep into a simpler story line for 19 minutes. Instead, 'Take My Life, Please' crushes under the weight of its bloated plot—not to mention that the overexplanation of jokes wasn't helping matters." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "One <b>would</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> {{a desire}} to make money is the more usual object, but I think you're right. In fact, you have touched upon a pet idea of mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No idea," [...] she answered. [...] "One <b>would</b> <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> it {{was someone}} of importance. Are you any wiser than when you came dear master?" [...] she added under her breath.|$|E

6000|$|... "I think, Comrade Wilberfloss," [...] he said, [...] "we {{are talking}} at cross-purposes. You keep harping on Comrade White and his views and tastes. One <b>would</b> almost <b>imagine</b> <b>that</b> you fancied that Comrade White was the {{proprietor}} of this paper." ...|$|R
