To overcome this problem, a new approach was used: long fibers combined with the development of a matrix compatible with natural fibers. Durable cement-based laminates reinforced with five layers of long, unidirectionally aligned sisal fibers were developed. Flat sheets were cast by a manual hand lay-up technique in a self-compacted cement matrix and then compressed with a pressure of 3 MPa. To ensure the durability of the composites, the portland cement (PC) matrix was modified by the replacement of PC by metakaolin and calcined <b>waste</b> <b>crushed</b> clay brick to consume the calcium hydroxide generated during the hydration of the portland cement.

The calcium hydroxide (Ca (OH) 2) content of the hardened pastes were determined and analysed with the aid of Energy Dispersive X-Ray Spectrometry (ED-XRFS).

In a view to ensuring sustainable stormwater management, a new eco-material has been designed for producing permeable pavements. This material is a mixture of construction <b>wastes</b> (<b>crushed</b> concrete) and organic matter (compost).

All the concretes were produced to have the same workability. The physical, mechanical and durability properties of the RAC were determined and compared with the results obtained for conventional concrete. The results showed that an increase in the percentages of FRA used in the concrete production led to a decrease in density and an increase in water absorption. The mechanical and durability properties of all the concretes produced with fine ceramic recycled aggregates were similar to those of conventional concrete at 28 days.
