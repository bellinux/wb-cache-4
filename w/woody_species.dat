40|$|The family Balsaminaceae is {{essentially}} herbaceous, {{except for some}} <b>woodier</b> <b>species</b> that {{can be described as}} owoody' herbs or small shrubs. The family is nested within the so-called balsaminoid clade of Ericales, including the exclusively woody families Tetrameristaceae and Marcgraviaceae, which is sister to the remaining families of the predominantly woody order. A molecular phylogeny of Balsaminaceae is compared with wood anatomical observations to find out whether the <b>woodier</b> <b>species</b> are derived from herbaceous taxa (i. e. secondary woodiness), or whether woodiness in the family represents the ancestral state for the order (i. e. primary woodiness). status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Dambo’s are grassy {{drainage}} channels and basins {{with little to}} no woody vegetation but very palatable grasses. Most <b>woody</b> <b>species</b> grow on exposed termitaria as dambo’s tend to retain water very well. Dambo’s are of a vital importance to grazing mammal species {{as well as several}} woodland mammals that choose to graze on the fringes, especially during the dry season. Several large (several square km) grassy plains occur within the park such as Chinyangali close to Fibwe and the Chikufwe plain east of the Luwombwa River.|$|E
25|$|The inverse {{situation}} existed {{with regard}} to clearing for wood in the Amazon rain forest, of which about 15% had been cleared by 1994, {{and part of the}} remainder had been disturbed by selective logging. Because the Amazon forest is highly heterogeneous, with hundreds of <b>woody</b> <b>species</b> per hectare, there is considerable distance between individual trees of economic value, such as mahogany and cerejeira. Therefore, this type of forest is not normally cleared for timber extraction but logged through high-grading, or selection of the most valuable trees. Because of vines, felling, and transportation, their removal causes destruction of many other trees, and the litter and new growth create a risk of forest fires, which are otherwise rare in rainforests. In favorable locations, such as Paragominas, in the northeastern part of Pará State, a new pattern of timber extraction has emerged: diversification and the production of plywood have led to the economic use of more than 100 tree species.|$|E
25|$|The {{removal of}} grass by grazing affects the woody plant {{component}} of woodland systems in two major ways. Grasses compete with woody plants for {{water in the}} topsoil and removal by grazing reduces this competitive effect, potentially boosting tree growth. In addition to this effect, the removal of fuel reduces both the intensity {{and the frequency of}} fires which may control woody plant species. Grazing animals can have a more direct effect on woody plants by the browsing of palatable <b>woody</b> <b>species.</b> There is evidence that unpalatable woody plants have increased under grazing in savannas. Grazing also promotes the spread of weeds in savannas by the removal or reduction of the plants which would normally compete with potential weeds and hinder establishment. In addition to this, cattle and horses are implicated in the spread of the seeds of weed species such as Prickly Acacia (Acacia nilotica) and Stylo (Stylosanthes spp.). Alterations in savanna species composition brought about by grazing can alter ecosystem function, and are exacerbated by overgrazing and poor land management practices.|$|E

Highly specific and efficient genome editing systems will be required in woody plants, because most <b>woody</b> plant <b>species</b> exhibit lower transformation efficiencies compared to annual crop plant species tested with the CRISPR/Cas 9 system.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} aimed {{to compare the}} <b>woody</b> plant <b>species</b> {{richness}} and cover (%) of five abandoned olive groves and five maquis ecosystems in central Greece and to describe the relationship between <b>woody</b> plant <b>species</b> richness {{and a set of}} environmental variables [soil pH, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and organic matter; air temperature and humidity; altitude; slope; type of ecosystem; and presence of leaf litter]. Although woody plants are abundant in the abandoned olive groves, the number of species and amount of cover (%) are significantly greater in maquis. According to principal component analysis, <b>woody</b> plant <b>species</b> richness was positively correlated with soil organic matter, plant litter, and soil P and K in maquis. Also, <b>woody</b> plant <b>species</b> richness was positively correlated with slope in the abandoned olive groves.

2500|$|A lack of {{naturally}} available propagules {{can be a}} major {{limiting factor}} in restoration success. Therefore, actively planting native vegetation is often crucial for the successful establishment of riparian species. Common methods for actively restoring vegetation include broadcast sowing seed and directly planting seeds, plugs, or seedlings. Reestablishing clonal species such as willows can often be accomplished by simply putting cuttings directly into the ground. To increase survival rates, young plants {{may need to be}} protected from herbivory with fencing or tree shelters.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the association between}} ectomycorrhizal (ECM) and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and pioneer <b>woody</b> plant <b>species</b> in areas devastated by the eruption of Mt. Usu, Japan, in 2000. We observed eight <b>woody</b> plant <b>species</b> at the research site, {{most of which were}} associated with ECM and/or AM fungi. In particular, dominant <b>woody</b> plant <b>species</b> Populus maximowiczii, Salix hultenii var. angustifolia and Salix sachalinensis were consistently associated with ECM fungi and erratically associated with AM fungi. We found one to six morphotypes in the roots of each ECM host and, on average, two in the roots of each seedling, indicating low ECM fungal diversity. ECM colonization ranged from 17 to 42 % of root tips. Using morphotyping and molecular analyses, 15 ECM fungi were identified. ECM fungi differed greatly between hosts. However, Laccaria amethystea, Hebeloma mesophaeum, Thelephora terrestris and other Thelephoraceae had high relative colonization, constituting the majority of the ECM colonization in the roots of each plant species. These ECM fungi may be important for the establishment of pioneer <b>woody</b> plant <b>species</b> and further revegetation at Mt. Usu volcano...|$|R
2500|$|Mulga scrub is {{distinctive}} and widespread, with the Mulga Lands of eastern Australia {{defined as a}} specific bioregion. The dominant species in these woodlands is mulga, with poplar box (Eucalyptus populnea) forming an increasingly important codominant in the eastern districts. [...] The extent of ground cover in mulga woodlands varies with canopy density of the overstorey, becoming almost nonexistent in extremely dense stands. In more open stands, the herbaceous layer consists of wire grasses (Aristida spp.), mulga oats (Monocather sp.), mulga mitchell (Thyridolepis sp.), wanderrie (Eriachne spp.), finger grasses (Digitaria spp.) and love grasses (Eragrostis spp.). [...] Various other <b>woody</b> <b>species</b> are also significant in mulga woodlands, particularly hop bushes (Dodonaea spp.), Eremophila and cassia (Senna [...] spp.).|$|E
2500|$|The common {{rhododendron}} {{is perhaps}} {{the greatest threat to}} the ecology of the park. It is an evergreen shrub with a natural distribution in the Mediterranean and Black Sea areas. Rhododendrons died out in Ireland because of climate change thousands of years ago. It was introduced to the Killarney area during the 19th century, and rapidly took hold. It has spread through its large numbers of very small easily dispersed seeds. It shades the ground flora and so prevents the regeneration of native <b>woody</b> <b>species.</b> More than [...] of the park are now completely infested. They have had a devastating effect in certain parts of the park. As light cannot penetrate the dense thickets of rhododendrons, very few plants can live beneath it. The park's oak woods are in long-term danger because they cannot regenerate. There is a policy of control and eradication of rhododendrons in the park.|$|E

2500|$|Fire {{behavior}} {{is different in}} every ecosystem and the organisms in those ecosystems have adapted accordingly. One sweeping generality is that in all ecosystems, fire creates a mosaic of different habitat patches, with areas ranging from those having just been burned to {{those that have been}} untouched by fire for many years. This is a form of ecological succession in which a freshly burned site will progress through continuous and directional phases of colonization following the destruction caused by the fire. [...] Ecologists usually characterize succession through the changes in vegetation that successively arise. After a fire, the first species to re-colonize will be those with seeds are already present in the soil, or those with seeds are able to travel into the burned area quickly. These are generally fast-growing herbaceous plants that require light and are intolerant of shading. As time passes, more slowly growing, shade-tolerant <b>woody</b> <b>species</b> will suppress some of the herbaceous plants. Conifers are often early successional species, while broad leaf trees frequently replace them in the absence of fire. Hence, many conifer forests are themselves dependent upon recurring fire.|$|E
2500|$|Tholkappia Poonga or Adyar Eco Park (also {{known as}} Adyar Poonga) is an {{ecological}} park {{set up by}} the Government of Tamil Nadu in the Adyar estuary area of Chennai, India.

40|$|A {{study on}} the {{diversity}} of <b>woody</b> plant <b>species</b> of Boke salt valley landscape in a semi-arid ecosystem of Borana was conducted. The area is a volcanic crater lake with the lake at the bottom base. Vegetation of such volcanic areas is expected to develop {{through the process of}} succession over years. Line transects were laid along four geographical directions (aspects). A total of 22 quadrats (20 m x 20 m) were used for woody vegetation sampling and the height and diameter at breast height (DBH) data were collected for each species. Vegetation data were analyzed using PC-ORD, CANOCO and SPSS software. A total of 24 <b>woody</b> plant <b>species</b> representing 18 genera in 14 families were recorded. The density of woody plants recorded {{in the present study was}} 2622 individuals ha- 1. The results showed that the <b>woody</b> plant <b>species</b> diversity and evenness indices were 2. 1 and 0. 661, respectively. Moreover, three plant community types were identified namely: Suaeda monoica, Maerua triphylla-Acalypha fruticosa and Hibiscus aponeurus-Solanum somalensis.

40|$|Insect-induced galls are {{observed}} on plants throughout the world, bur patterns of gall-inducing insect species richness are not random. In the USA and Brazil, species richness increases with decreasing altitude, which {{is associated with}} increasing temperature and aridity. ht a given elevation the number of gall-inducing insect species is also higher in drier habitats than mesic habitats. However, variations {{in the number of}} potential host plant species, related to soil fertility, may be the cause of these patterns, nor differences in temperature and aridity. We examined patterns of species richness of gall-inducing insects by counting the number of gall-inducing insect species and plant species, and measuring soil phosphorus, in replicate dry and mesic plots at five locations along an altitudinal aridity gradient in Big Bend National Park, Texas. Almost all galls were on <b>woody</b> plant <b>species</b> (trees or shrubs). We found the greatest number of gall-inducing insect species at intermediate elevations, and in more mesic habitats, rather than at low altitudes or in drier habitats. The number of <b>woody</b> plant <b>species</b> was also highest at intermediate elevations and in mesic habitats. Soil phosphorus was high at both extremes of the altitudinal gradient, where few gall-inducing insect species occurred. Our results show that patterns of species richness of gall-inducing insects may largely be a function of the number of <b>woody</b> plant <b>species</b> present. The chance of a gall-inducing insect finding its specific host plant species increases as the number of <b>woody</b> plant <b>species</b> increases. The effect of soil fertility requires further study but the findings suggest that high soil fertility does not favor gall-inducing insects...|$|R
