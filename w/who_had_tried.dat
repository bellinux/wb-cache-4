40|$|Aim of the study: To {{investigate}} {{the possibilities of}} planning, succession and development of aid for adolescents in Kaunas city <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to commit suicide. Objectives: 1. to define the main stages in providing help for adolescents <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to commit suicide; 2. to clarify interdepartmental obstacles providing help for adolescents in crisis; 3. to formulate recommendations {{for the development of}} aid for adolescents in Kaunas <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to commit suicide. Methods: Qualitative, descriptive analysis. Information was gathered using semi-structured interview method. There were questioned 21 respondents from institutions involving four Lithuanian systems that provide aid for adolescents <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to commit suicide: Social Security, Health Service, Educational and Interior. Questions were related to suicide prevention, intervention and postvention. Results: Main stages in providing aid for adolescents <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to commit suicide were defined: detecting a child <b>who</b> <b>has</b> <b>tried</b> or is at risk of committing suicide, providing urgent aid, and providing continued aid. Vacancies were detected in all stages of providing aid. Representatives from all the institutions that provide aid to adolescents <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to commit suicide agree {{that there is a need}} of interdepartmental cooperation in Lithuania, though the results of the analysis show that such cooperation has still been weakly developed. Three main obstacles in interdepartmental cooperation have been defined: 1. conditioned by the child in crisis and his/her kin; 2. related to detecting the child in crisis and providing the proper aid; 3. arising from directing children and youth to other departments. Obstacles conditioned by a child in crisis and his kin are usually faced by juvenile inspectors, family doctors, and school psychologists. Mostly juvenile inspectors and health professionals lack knowledge in treating adolescents <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to commit suicide. Perhaps the biggest obstacle related to detecting a child in crisis and providing appropriate aid is confidentiality as well as absence of feedback and negative attitude of institutions towards professionals of other institutions. Conclusions: 1. The services provided by medical, educational, legal safety and social institutions for adolescents <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to commit suicide in Kaunas city include detecting children at risk for suicide, urgent medical aid, continued treatment, and psychological, social rehabilitation. 2. The main obstacles in interdepartmental cooperation among institutions providing aid for adolescents <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to commit suicide are imperfection of legal aid succession and cooperation, problems in segmentation of information, feedback and confidentiality, unfriendly attitudes of professionals and public towards aid and insufficient knowledge of suicide prevention. 3. In order to carry the prevention of youth suicide more effectively it is essential to develop the cooperation system among institutions that face adolescents <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>tried</b> to commit suicide, educate public and professionals who provide aid, motivate family care of their children...|$|R

To encourage Keller to sign, Krichell met and had dinner with his family. In 1937, Krichell signed shortstop Phil Rizzuto, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> out with the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants, but was dismissed by them {{on the grounds that}} he was too small. Even so, Krichell decided to look at the infielder and was impressed by the way Rizzuto accomplished double plays; his technique reminded Krichell of Leo Durocher, one of his favorite players. He signed Rizzuto for $75 a month and sent him to the Yankees' farm club in Bassett, Virginia.|$|E

All the victims were local Croats, save one Serb, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> to protect his neighbours. Gunfire was {{the leading cause of}} death, though some of the victims were killed with axes or chainsaws, or were burned to death. The victims exhibited signs of torture and were left unburied.

The killings and the destruction took twelve hours and claimed the lives of 43 civilians. The bodies of the victims were mutilated and left on display, presumably as a warning to others, outside Voćin itself, to flee or perish. All the victims were Croat civilians, except one 77-year-old Serb <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> to protect his neighbours from the paramilitaries.

For the Fasci the women abandoned the Church, but not the religious sentiment, to protest against the priests, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> to frighten them and isolate them with the threat of excommunication.

5|$|One {{source of}} {{conflict}} was the ancient distrust, rivalry, and hostility between the Old Swiss Confederacy and the House of Habsburg, which {{had risen to}} the throne of the Holy Roman Emperor since 1438. Since the late 13th century, {{the members of the}} Swiss Confederacy had gradually taken control of territories that once had belonged to the Habsburg realm. The Swiss had attained the status of imperial immediacy, being subject only to the emperor himself, and not to any intermediate Princes or liege lords. This status granted them a far-reaching autonomy within the Holy Roman Empire, even more so as the emperor was a distant overlord. Before 1438, the empire and the emperor had been an antipole to the Habsburg dukes for the Swiss. Previous emperors had repeatedly supported the confederates in their struggles against the Habsburgs, whom they saw as strong rivals. They had confirmed the Imperial immediacy of the Swiss on several occasions; and the Swiss had succeeded in defending their privileged status against Habsburg dukes <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> to regain their former territories.|$|E

5|$|Amid growing French and US {{skepticism}} of {{his ability}} to provide stable rule, Diệm forced the matter to a head in April 1955. He ordered the Bình Xuyên to relinquish control of the National Police and submit to his command by integrating into the VNA or disbanding, threatening to crush them if they refused. He bribed Hòa Hảo and Cao Đài commanders into joining the VNA, gradually resulting in the defection of some commanders and their units, while others continued to lead their forces against Saigon. The Bình Xuyên defied Diệm's ultimatum. On 27 April, the VNA initiated the Battle for Saigon. After a brief but violent battle that left between 500 and 1,000 people dead and about 20,000 homeless, the Bình Xuyên were crushed. Diệm had regained both U.S. confidence and control of the police. Jubilant crowds lauded Diệm and denounced Bảo Đại, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> to dismiss {{him in the middle of}} the battle to prevent him from quelling the Bình Xuyên.

5|$|Following Jardine's {{appointment}} as England captain in July 1932, {{he developed a}} plan based on his belief that Bradman was weak against bowling directed at leg stump and that if this line of attack could be maintained, it would restrict Bradman's scoring {{to one side of}} the field, giving the bowlers greater control of his scoring. In a meeting, he outlined his plan to Larwood and Voce, who tried out the tactic in the remainder of the season with mixed success. Both Nottinghamshire fast bowlers were selected to tour, as was Yorkshire bowler Bill Bowes <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>tried</b> similar tactics at the end of the season. In one match, he bowled short at Jack Hobbs; in his capacity as cricket correspondent of The Morning Post, Warner was highly critical of the Yorkshire bowlers and Bowes in particular.
