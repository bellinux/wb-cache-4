6000|$|... "Have any {{of these}} painted scaramouches {{anchored}} off the harbor towards which <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running,</b> {{with the hope of}} cutting us off in entering?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Great gophers, boys, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> {{right into}} a nest of the rebels!" [...] he whispered. [...] "Back with you, {{before it is too}} late." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have {{you seen}} this proclamation?" [...] {{one of the}} villagers asked. [...] "You see that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> no little risk, in taking you in." ...|$|E
60|$|Soon <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> {{through a}} suffusing wide veil of mist; neither ship nor boat to be seen.|$|R
60|$|He {{had turned}} the canoe while speaking, and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> up stream {{in less than two}} minutes after having sighted the Britishers.|$|R
5000|$|The NCU <b>were</b> <b>running</b> road {{races and}} <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> road races and there wasn't {{any need for}} {{amalgamation}} the NCU and the BLRC, to form the British Cycling Federationat all. Percy Stallard.|$|R
6000|$|... "Isn't it queer that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> into so many Germans?" [...] remarked Spouter. [...] "First that Herman Crouse on the train, and {{now these}} chaps." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lower the sail," [...] said Midwinter, quietly, [...] "and {{ship the}} oars. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> {{down on her}} fast enough now, {{whether we like it}} or not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Mary; <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> {{straight}} {{before the}} wind, which is blowing {{right up the}} lake. There {{is nothing to be}} done but to keep straight before it." ...|$|E
60|$|So I {{told her}} as well as I could all about the wedding and how wild <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{to see it and}} why <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> away to it.|$|R
6000|$|SECRETARY--[Alert and {{suspicious}} {{but with an}} easy laugh.] Think <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> a crap game? That door is never locked. What put that in your nut? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running,</b> <b>we</b> could rig up a spinnaker," [...] the {{fisherman}} answered; [...] "but {{the wind has}} come round three points. We can do no more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What think you," [...] {{the earl}} {{said to the}} captain, [...] "of our position? Where are we, and where will the course upon which <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> take us?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The encounter, however, {{had taken}} time, and now Ben called upon his {{companion}} to stop running. [...] "We {{want to know}} where <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> to first," [...] he said. [...] "Listen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{quarter of}} an hour at least," [...] replied Dave. [...] "It will depend {{somewhat}} on how much steam the firemen can get up. I don't believe <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> at full speed now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We had {{a narrow}} squeak of it, Mr. Ryan," [...] {{he said to}} the first-mate. [...] "All the time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> before that gale I had that group of islands on my mind." ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly I {{perceived}} that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> down the incline from Chalk Farm to Euston. I started at this passing of time. I {{turned on him}} with a brutal question, with the tone of Now or never.|$|R
5000|$|... "While <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> {{across the}} bridge ... I spotted this lieutenant, {{standing}} out there completely exposed to the machine gun fire that was pretty heavy by this time. He was cutting wires and kicking the German demolition charges off the bridge with his feet!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, it {{was just}} to show he was run after. I wonder if he thinks <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> after him? Momma, I am tired of him! I wish he wouldn't speak to me any more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> behind dreadfully," [...] {{suggested}} Arthur, the bookkeeper, [...] "even since Thursday Smith {{enabled us}} to cut down expenses so greatly. The money that comes in never equals what we pay out. How long can you keep this up, girls?" ...|$|E
60|$|We pelted on steadily, {{keeping the}} cab in sight, through dark mazy streets. God only, I thought, knows why <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> at all, but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> hard. Fortunately {{we did not}} run far. The cab pulled up at the fork of two streets and Sir Walter paid the cabman, who drove away rejoicing, having just {{come in contact with}} the more generous among the rich. Then the two men talked {{together}} as men do talk together after giving and receiving great insults, the talk which leads either to forgiveness or a duel--at least so it seemed as we watched it from ten yards off. Then the two men shook hands heartily, and one went down one fork of the road and one down another.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{old days}} when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> Russian operations, if you had a double agent the worst that {{happened}} was he feeds you false information. These days if you have a double agent he detonates in your face. Gary Berntsen, former CIA officer ...|$|R
60|$|I did {{not think}} much of her words at the time, but {{afterwards}} they came back to me. So we slipped away together, followed by the dog Koos, and soon <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> over the veldt with our faces set towards the country of the Zulu tribe.|$|R
2500|$|Having {{achieved}} what he wanted, {{with the}} NCU's final acceptance of massed racing on the road, Stallard placed {{the continuity of}} the BLRC over {{the end of the civil}} war that the BLRC and the NCU had conducted. He said: [...] "The NCU <b>were</b> <b>running</b> road races and <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> road races and there wasn't any need for amalgamation [...] at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{an idiot}} I have been," [...] he said, {{knitting}} his brows. [...] "Port, Margharita! The left string! That's right! Now, sit firm, {{and when we}} go down, lean to the other side. You mustn't mind {{if you get a}} little wet. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> in the teeth of the wind, and it will be roughish." ...|$|E
60|$|Another brutal sea-superstition vindicated. From now on and for always these imbeciles of ours {{will believe}} that Finns are Jonahs. We are {{west of the}} Diego de Ramirez Rocks, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> west at a twelve-knot clip with an easterly gale at our backs. And the {{carpenter}} is gone. His passing, and {{the coming of the}} easterly wind, were coincidental.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, ay, sir, {{they see}} us, and mean to hit us too; but <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> across their fire, and {{that with a}} ten-knot breeze; but, when we heave in stays, and get in a line with their guns, we shall see, {{and it may be}} feel, more of their work than we do now; a thirty-two an't trained as easily as a fowling-piece or a ducking-gun." ...|$|E
2500|$|... â€œAt sunrise {{the faint}} {{outlines}} of Gaspar Island {{could be seen}} and as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> with a free wind 6 knots, by daylight were within 15 miles of it on our starboard bow. This is the Island where Capt. Gordon landed from the Memnon on Pulo Leat.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} me as if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> {{contrary}} to that which my master would have commanded, and there were tears in my eyes, of which I was not ashamed, when Nathaniel and I, hand in hand, followed Master Hunt out of the house we had helped to build.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know. Looked {{as if she}} {{was afraid}} of him. When I first saw her she was on the car {{platform}} and I reckoned she was bracing herself to jump off. Since <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> across a trestle, I pulled her from the steps. That's how the thing began." ...|$|R
60|$|But still, I cannot {{but believe}} that if we do go on in prosperity, {{careless}} and unthankful, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> into danger; we are likely to bring down on ourselves some sorrow or anxiety which will teach us, which at least is meant to teach us--from whom all good things come; and to know that the Lord has given, when the Lord has taken away.|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{the present}} moment, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> nearly due east but, {{as we have}} been round the compass, several times, since the gale struck us, there is no means of saying, with {{anything}} like certainty, where our position is. But I was talking it over with the captain, before I went down, and we both agreed that, as the centre of the hurricane is undoubtedly moving to the northeast, we must have gone a good many miles in that direction.|$|E
6000|$|... "Between fifty {{and sixty}} miles from Rathlin," [...] the {{fisherman}} said. [...] "It was eight o'clock when we started, ten when the squall struck us, {{it will be}} dark by four, and fast as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>running</b> we shall scarcely be {{in time to catch}} the last gleam of day. Come, boys," [...] he said to his sons, [...] "give her a little more canvas still, for it is life and death to reach Colonsay before nightfall, for if we miss it we shall be dashed on to the Mull long before morning." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{qualifying}} third, Tony Stewart {{said his}} team is [...] "gaining on it. We've just {{got to get a}} little break here to get going. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> going good last week. The guy that won the race, our teammate Busch, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> the same lap times as him the whole race until we had our problem." ...|$|R
5000|$|When <b>we</b> <b>were</b> {{doing the}} final {{sequencing}} of the 'LOAD' album, {{the record company}} told us that we couldn't go a second past 78:59, or your CD's wouldn't play without potentially skipping. With our 14 songs, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> about 30 seconds over, and something had to give, so the cool-ass jam {{at the end of}} 'Outlaw' got chopped.|$|R
5000|$|... "We <b>were</b> pushing it. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>running</b> twenty-six {{hours each}} day. They had an {{incredible}} amount of energy. God, I remember the scenes in the studio ... the word intense is not intense enough! I let them do what they naturally did and merely tried to catch some of it on tape." [...] â€”Shadow Morton, on recording with the band ...|$|R
