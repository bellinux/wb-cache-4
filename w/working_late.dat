25|$|Wilson {{was called}} into the England team for their first ever meeting with Wales. The match was played at the Kennington Oval on 18 January 1879 in a blizzard. Due to the atrocious {{snowfall}} both captains agreed to play halves of only 30 minutes each. The poor attendance (reports range from 85 to 300) was also attributed to the weather. Some sources suggest that William Clegg turned up 20 minutes late for the game. Clegg, a solicitor, was <b>working</b> <b>late</b> on a case (the trial of Charles Peace, the Banner Cross murderer) {{and was unable to}} leave Sheffield for London on the Friday night. The next morning, the southbound train with Clegg on it, was delayed by heavy snow. The match started without Clegg and England played with ten men until he arrived.

As Wales had been defeated 9–0 in their previous international against Scotland, England were confident of victory and selected an inexperienced eleven, including five débutantes. The match was played at the Kennington Oval in a blizzard. Due to the atrocious snowfall both captains agreed to play halves of only 30 minutes each.

500|$|Several {{television}} shows, movies, {{and video}} games were referenced. Andy compares stress to a mayor who decrees {{it is illegal to}} dance—as in the plot of Footloose—and relieves his stress by dancing to the film's title song. Stanley complains that, after <b>working</b> <b>late</b> for Jim, he was forced to watch Rizzoli & Isles with his wife. Andy refers to Jim as [...] "Judge Judy" [...] when he asks what his jury case was about.

500|$|Most tracks {{involved}} each of {{the group}} recording their parts separately; unlike earlier albums, Townshend had left space in his demos for other band members to contribute, {{though most of the}} synthesizers on the finished album came from his ARP 2500 synthesizer and were recorded at home. The only song arranged by the band in the studio was [...] "5.15". According to Nevison, the ARP 2500 was impossible to record in the studio, and changing sounds was cumbersome {{due to a lack of}} patches, which required Townshend to work on these parts at home, <b>working</b> <b>late</b> into the night. To obtain a good string section sound on the album, Townshend bought a cello and over two weeks learned how to play it well enough to be recorded.|$|E

Soon afterwards, however, they were approached by Scott Miller of Apogee Software to develop an original game to be published through the Apogee shareware model. Hall designed the three-part game, John Carmack and Romero programmed it, Wilbur managed the team, and artist Adrian Carmack helped later in development.

500|$|Hathaway {{prepared}} for the part by volunteering for a week as an assistant at an auction house where she was [...] "put through the wringer" [...] according to Weisberger, who adds that Hathaway supplemented that by asking her many questions about working for Wintour. Frankel recalls that she was nervous {{through most of the}} shooting, particularly when <b>working</b> <b>late,</b> since Raffaello Follieri, her boyfriend at that time, preferred strongly that she not do so; she was also having health issues due to a cyst. The director said she was [...] "terrified" [...] before starting her first scene with Streep, who had begun her working relationship with Hathaway by saying first [...] "I think you're perfect for the role and I'm so happy we're going to be working on this together" [...] then warning her that was the last nice thing she would say. Streep applied this philosophy to everyone else on set as well, keeping her distance from the cast and crew members unless it was necessary to discuss something with them.|$|E
500|$|Wilson's {{ceremonial}} {{duties and}} work on History of the Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in America kept him extremely busy, <b>working</b> <b>late</b> hours with little time to rest.

The crash left him with a shattered jaw, which had to be wired shut in reconstructive surgery. The accident inspired West; two weeks after being admitted to the hospital, he recorded a song at the Record Plant Studios with his jaw still wired shut. The composition, [...] "Through The Wire", expressed West's experience after the accident, and helped lay the foundation for his debut album, as according to West [...] "all the better artists have expressed what they were going through". West added that [...] "the album was my medicine", as working on the record distracted him from the pain. [...] "Through The Wire" [...] was first available on West's Get Well Soon... mixtape, released December 2002.
