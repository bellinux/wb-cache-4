5|$|Edwards {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the film after seeing fishermen attempt to bring a creature in with a net, and imagining a monster inside. He pitched the idea to Vertigo Films, who suggested he watch In Search of a Midnight Kiss, a low-budget film starring McNairy. Edwards cast McNairy and Able in the lead roles. Principal photography lasted three weeks and had a production crew of six people. Filming took place in five countries, and many locations were used without permission. Most of the extras <b>were</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> at these locations during filming and were persuaded to act in it; all of their dialogue was improvised, and Edwards provided outlines of the primary plot points.|$|E

Although the peninsulares and the creoles enjoyed the same social power, as they both {{belonged to the}} principalia, the peninsulares considered themselves as socially superior to the creoles.|$|E

Those people have been banned." [...] Davis denied that Scientology leadership arranged a campaign to manipulate entries on Wikipedia. He asserted, [...] "The church is huge ...

[...] These institutionalized practices came to be called The Holocaust, and began with legalized social discrimination against specific groups, and involuntary hospitalization, euthanasia, and forced sterilization of those considered physically or mentally unfit for society. [...] These practices escalated during World War II to include non-judicial incarceration, confiscation of property, forced labor, sexual slavery, medical experimentation, and death through overwork, undernourishment, and execution through a variety of methods, with genocide of different groups as the primary goal.|$|E

Murray also cited the main characters in On the Black Hill, [...] "although not strictly exiles... were exiles from the major events of their time and its dominant values." [...] Similarly, Murray wrote, Utz is [...] "trapped in a society whose values are not his own but which he cannot bring himself to leave." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} written and {{directed}} by Gareth Edwards, while Allan Niblo and James Richardson of Vertigo Films served as producers. Edwards did not storyboard or script the film, but wrote a treatment of the story and outlines that detailed specifics points that needed to be hit in dialogue. The filming equipment cost approximately $15,000, and the production budget came in [...] "way under" [...] $500,000. The film was able to be made on such a low budget largely due to the production using consumer grade prosumer level equipment instead of professional paraphernalia. For instance, the film was shot using digital video cameras rather than the more expensive 35mm film and was edited on a laptop computer. Many of the locations in the film were used without permission, and most of the extras <b>were</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> already at the locations. As the extras were non-actors who were persuaded to be in the film, their actions were improvised.|$|E
500|$|Filmmaker Walt Disney {{himself had}} first {{attempted}} {{to adapt the}} Brothers Grimm fairy tale [...] "Rapunzel" [...] into a feature-length animated film during the 1930s and 1940s. However, the project was eventually abandoned because the original fairy tale was considered too [...] "small". When they were first approached to direct Tangled in 2008, directors Nathan Greno and Byron Howard decided {{that it would be}} best [...] "to blow up the scale of the film" [...] and transform it into a [...] "big event", while updating and modernizing the story for a new audience. Flynn was conceived because the directors felt that [...] "Rapunzel needed to get out ... So she needed to meet a guy to take her to where she's going." [...] In the original fairy tale, Rapunzel's love interest is a prince. However, Greno and Howard decided to make him a thief – dubbed [...] "a subtle yet startling twist for Disney" [...] by The New York Times – in order to avoid creating a character who is too [...] "safe", opting for a funnier and [...] "edgier" [...] antihero instead. Greno elaborated, [...] "When you look back at some of the past Disney princes ... {{a lot of them are}} kind of soft and they're not like people we think are that cool," [...] continuing, [...] "They're good guys, so I guess we sort of took that to the other extreme." [...] However, some of the filmmakers themselves were concerned that Flynn was becoming too edgy. Greno revealed that [...] "There <b>were</b> <b>people</b> ... <b>who</b> <b>were</b> a little worried because they were hearing these rumors, 'Well, it's not a prince it's a thief. He's kind of a ladies' man, and he's very arrogant.'" [...] Greno summarized Flynn's conception and development to Orange: ...|$|E

The number of strikes in 2009 exceeded the 2008 total, {{according to data}} compiled by the Long War Journal, which tracks strikes in Pakistan. [...] In December 2009, the New York Times reported that President Obama ordered {{an expansion of the}} drone program with senior officials describing the program as [...] "a resounding success, eliminating key terrorists and throwing their operations into disarray". [...] The article also cites a Pakistani official who stated that about 80 missile attacks {{in less than two years}} have killed “more than 400” enemy fighters, a number lower than most estimates but in the same range. His account of collateral damage was strikingly lower than many unofficial counts: “We believe the number of civilian casualties is just over 20, and those <b>were</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> either at the side of major terrorists or were at facilities used by terrorists.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The ABCC {{also drew}} {{on the work of}} Chinese scientists, who were already {{studying}} the survivors in the time before the ABCC arrived in Japan, so there was information from both American and Chinese officials. Masao Tsuzuki was the leading Japanese authority on the biological effects of radiation. He said there were four causes of injury in the bombed cities: heat, blast, primary radiation and radioactive poisonous gas. In a report that was released by Tsuzuki, he answered the question, [...] "What does strong radioactive energy do to the human body?" [...] His answer was, [...] "damage to blood, then hematopoetic organs such as bone marrow, spleen, and lymph nodes. [...] All are destroyed or damaged severely. Lungs, intestines, liver, kidney etc are affected and their functions disturbed as a result." [...] The damages were rated by severity. People suffering from severe damage <b>were</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> in within a 1km radius of the hypocenter. The severely affected people typically died within a few days, some living as long as two weeks. Moderate damage was seen in people living in a 1–2km. radius from the hypoenter, and those people would live for 2–6 weeks. Those people living within a 2–4km. radius had slight damage, and which would not cause death, but would cause some health problems during the several months after the exposure.|$|E
60|$|The {{greater part}} of the crowd on board--and, of course, the boat was crowded--looked {{as if they might}} not only be easily but safely known. There was little style and no {{distinction}} among them; they <b>were</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> going down to the beach for the fun or the relief of it, and were able to afford it. In face they were commonplace, with nothing but the American poetry of vivid purpose to light them up, where they did not wholly lack fire. But they were nearly all shrewd and friendly-looking, with an apparent readiness for the humorous intimacy native to us all. The women were dandified in dress, according to their means and taste, and the men differed from each other in degrees of indifference to it. To a straw-hatted population, such as ours is in summer, no sort of personal dignity is possible. We have not even the power over observers which comes from the fantasticality of an Englishman when he discards the conventional dress. In our straw hats and our serge or flannel sacks we are no more imposing than a crowd of boys.|$|E
60|$|Frank {{found this}} {{much harder than}} he had expected. The {{subjects}} in which he excelled {{did not seem to}} be of the least use to business men, and the fact that he could play several games moderately well did not seem to count at all. There <b>were</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> ready to give him a trial, but they seemed singularly unwilling to pay him enough to live in a way that he considered fitting; and this somewhat astonished as well as troubled him. In the end, a relative, who said that a young man with any grit and snap had better chances in the West, found him a position with a big milling company in Minneapolis. Frank accepted the position, but soon found it not much to his liking. The people he met were not like his Boston friends. They were mostly Germans and Scandinavians, and their ways were not those to which he had been accustomed. What was worse, they hustled him in the milling company's offices, and instead of teaching him the business kept him busy licking stamps, copying letters and answering telephones, which did not seem to him a fitting occupation for an intellectual lad.|$|E

60|$|Their {{mother came}} in now, and Maggie rushed away, that her burst of tears, which she felt must come, might not happen till she was safe upstairs. They were very bitter tears; {{everybody}} in the world seemed so hard and unkind to Maggie; there was no indulgence, no fondness, such as she imagined when she fashioned the world afresh in her own thoughts. In books there <b>were</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> always agreeable or tender, and delighted to do things that made one happy, and who did not show their kindness by finding fault. The world outside the books was not a happy one, Maggie felt; {{it seemed to be a}} world where people behaved the best to those they did not pretend to love, and that did not belong to them. And if life had no love in it, what else was there for Maggie? Nothing but poverty and the companionship of her mother's narrow griefs, perhaps of her father's heart-cutting childish dependence. There is no hopelessness so sad as that of early youth, when the soul is made up of wants, and has no long memories, no superadded life in the life of others; though we who looked on think lightly of such premature despair, as if our vision of the future lightened the blind sufferer's present.|$|E
60|$|I {{suppose that}} these were not very {{remarkable}} people, and that nothing but the indomitable interest our friends took in the human race could have enabled them to feel any concern in their companions. It was, no doubt, just such a company as goes down to Nantasket Beach every pleasant day in summer. Certain ones among them were distinguishable as sojourners at the beach, by an air of familiarity {{with the business of}} getting there, an indifference to the prospect, and an indefinable touch of superiority. These read their newspapers in quiet corners, or, if they were not of the newspaper sex, made themselves comfortable in the cabins, and looked about them at the other passengers with looks of lazy surprise, and just a hint of scorn for their interest in the boat's departure. Our day's pleasurers took it that the lady whose steady gaze had reduced them, when at lunch, to such a low ebb of shabbiness, was a regular boarder, at the least, in one of the beach hotels. A few other passengers were, like themselves, mere idlers for a day, and were eager to see all that the boat or the voyage offered of novelty. There were clerks and men who had book-keeping written in a neat mercantile hand upon their faces, and who had evidently been given that afternoon for a breathing-time; and there were strangers who were going down to the beach {{for the sake of the}} charming view of the harbor which the trip afforded. Here and there <b>were</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> not to be classed with any certainty,--as a pale young man, handsome in his undesirable way, who looked like a steamboat pantry boy not yet risen to be bar-tender, but rapidly rising, and who sat carefully balanced upon the railing of the boat, chatting with two young girls, who heard his broad sallies with continual snickers, and interchanged saucy comments with that prompt up-and-coming manner which is so large a part of non-humorous humor, as Mr. Lowell calls it, and now and then pulled and pushed each other. It was a scene worth study, for in no other country could anything so bad have been without being vastly worse; but here it was evident that there was nothing worse than you saw; and, indeed, these persons formed a sort of relief to the other passengers, who were nearly all monotonously well-behaved. Amongst a few there seemed to be acquaintance, but the far greater part were unknown to one another, and there were no words wasted by any one. I believe the English traveller who has taxed our nation with inquisitiveness for half a century is at last beginning to find out that we do not ask questions because we have the still more vicious custom of not opening our mouths at all when with strangers.|$|E
