5|$|ILC did {{not produce}} apparel for adults until the {{introduction}} of the Living Girdle in 1940, after patenting a method of manufacturing latex girdles that would not tear at the seams if they had a small tear or hole. The Living Girdle was advertised <b>with</b> <b>images</b> of mobility and comfort, such as women playing tennis or leaping while wearing it, though the solid rubber girdle was actually very uncomfortable.|$|E
5|$|Omaha Police {{arrived at}} Westroads Mall about six minutes after {{receiving}} the first 911 call. During the entire 70 seconds of that first call, all the dispatcher heard was gunshots. Audio tapes and transcripts of the 911 calls, along <b>with</b> <b>images</b> captured by mall security surveillance cameras, were released by the police on December 7, 2007. In one 911 call, gunshots can be heard.|$|E
5|$|The films' {{subject matter}} were often as {{disturbing}} as {{the manner in}} which they were played; <b>with</b> <b>images</b> of accidents, nuclear explosions, meat processing, spiders and scorpions stalking prey, gory drivers education films, and penis reconstruction surgery. Not all of the movies were horrific, and they often included nature, wildlife, and aquatic footage; as well as a color negative of a Charlie's Angels episode.|$|E
50|$|A {{category}} c with a functor to a category C {{is called a}} fibered category over C if for any morphism F from X to Y in C and any object y of c <b>with</b> <b>image</b> Y, there is a pullback f:x →y of y by F. This means a morphism <b>with</b> <b>image</b> F such that any morphism g:z→y <b>with</b> <b>image</b> G=FH can be factored as g=fh by a unique morphism h from z to x <b>with</b> <b>image</b> H. The element x=F*y is called the pullback of y along F and is unique up to canonical isomorphism.|$|R

5|$|The {{second floor}} of the monastery on the west called the Zelre Lhakhang {{provided}} an overview of the main Hayagriva image in the floor below, and also a small image of Nine-headed Hayagriva along <b>with</b> <b>images</b> of Padmasambhava, the 5th Dalai Lama and the protector deities. One floor above this was the Namgyel Lhakhang and the last floor above this was the living quarters of the Dalai Lamas and teachers of Sera Je.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was found}} {{shattered}} into thousands of pieces and is now heavily corroded, the helmet still bears evidence of its original finely decorated design. It was plated with silver-gilt and decorated <b>with</b> <b>images</b> of goddesses and equestrian scenes. It would {{have been used by}} a Roman auxiliary cavalryman for displays and possibly in battle. The identity of the owner is not known but the helmet was discovered on a native British ceremonial site, buried alongside thousands of Iron Age British and Roman coins. It is possible that the helmet was owned by a Briton who fought alongside the Romans during the conquest of Britain.|$|E
5|$|Apparently Constantine did not patronize Christianity alone. After gaining {{victory in}} the Battle of the Milvian Bridge (312), a triumphal arch—the Arch of Constantine—was built (315) to {{celebrate}} his triumph. The arch is decorated <b>with</b> <b>images</b> of the goddess Victoria. At {{the time of its}} dedication, sacrifices to gods like Apollo, Diana, and Hercules were made. Absent from the Arch are any depictions of Christian symbolism. However, as the Arch was commissioned by the Senate, the absence of Christian symbols may reflect the role of the Curia at the time as a pagan redoubt.|$|E

5|$|Five {{companies}} did {{the visual}} effects – Industrial Light & Magic, Double Negative, Moving Picture Company, Cinesite and Peerless – {{under the supervision}} of Steve Begg. The computer-generated effects included set extensions, digital touches on the vehicles, and crumbling buildings. A sixth one, Framestore, handled the title sequence, the seventh in the series designed by Daniel Kleinman. It took four months to complete, and centred on an octopus motif reminiscent of the Spectre logo, along <b>with</b> <b>images</b> of love and relationships.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the 8th century, patronage to Shaivism increased in every section of the society; the landed elite, landlords, assemblies (samaya), schools of learning (aghraharas) and minor ruling families such as the Bana, Nolamba and Chalukya clans. The Shaiva temples contained a Shiva linga (phallus) in the sanctum sanctorum along <b>with</b> <b>images</b> of the mother goddess, Surya (Sun god) and Nandi (a bull and attendant of Shiva) which was normally enshrined in a separate pavilion facing the sanctum. The linga was man made and in some cases had etchings of Ganapati (son of Shiva) and Parvati (consort and wife of Shiva) on it. Due to the vigorous efforts of priests and ascetics, Shaiva monastic orders flourished in many places such as Nandi Hills, Avani and Hebbata in modern Kolar district.|$|E
5|$|Hunters of game {{have long}} {{made use of}} {{camouflage}} {{in the form of}} materials such as animal skins, mud, foliage, and green or brown clothing to enable them to approach wary game animals. Field sports such as driven grouse shooting conceal hunters in hides (also called blinds or shooting butts). Modern hunting clothing makes use of fabrics that provide a disruptive camouflage pattern; for example, in 1986 the hunter Bill Jordan created cryptic clothing for hunters, printed <b>with</b> <b>images</b> of specific kinds of vegetation such as grass and branches.|$|E

5|$|Imagery {{has always}} been an {{important}} part of the Orb's persona. This is most prominent during live performances, where they often project surreal images against onstage screens. Common images include morphing faces, futuristic cityscapes, and aliens. They have long associated their act with absurd symbology <b>with</b> <b>images</b> such as floating pigs. This has carried over to their music videos, most of which are spacy, brightly coloured montages of surreal images including astronauts, clouds, and neon dolphins. Because of their use of psychedelic images at shows, the Orb's shows are frequently compared to those of Pink Floyd, who also used in-show imagery and films. Paterson cites Godfrey Reggio's and Philip Glass's film Koyaanisqatsi as a primary influence to their concert imagery.|$|E
5|$|In Nuskhuri manuscripts, Asomtavruli {{are used}} for titles and {{illuminated}} capitals. The latter were used at the beginnings of paragraphs which started new sections of text. In {{the early stages of}} the development of Nuskhuri texts, Asomtavruli letters were not elaborate and were distinguished principally by size and sometimes by being written in cinnabar ink. Later, from the 10th century, the letters were illuminated. The style of Asomtavruli capitals can be used to identify the era of a text. For example, in the Georgian manuscripts of the Byzantine era, when the styles of the Byzantine Empire influenced Kingdom of Georgia, capitals were illuminated <b>with</b> <b>images</b> of birds and other animals.|$|E
5|$|K'inich Popol Hol {{inherited}} {{the throne of}} Copán from K'inich ax K'uk' Mo', who was his father. He undertook major construction projects with the redesign of the core of Copán. Popol Hol is not the original name of this king but rather a nickname based on the appearance of his Teotihuacan-linked name glyph. K'inich Popol Hol oversaw {{the construction of the}} first version of the Mesoamerican ballcourt at the city, which was decorated <b>with</b> <b>images</b> of the scarlet macaw, a bird that features prominently in Maya mythology. His greatest construction activity was in the area of his father's palace, now underlying Structure 10L-16, which he demolished after entombing his father there. He then built three successive buildings on top of the tomb in rapid succession.|$|E

5|$|Madonna's {{performance}} of the song during the 2006 Confessions Tour was controversial. She was raised from the floor hanging on a mirrored cross wearing a red blouse and velvet pants, with a crown of thorns on her head. During the performance, the number 12million flashed above her on the stage's backdrop screens, along <b>with</b> <b>images</b> of African children. This was intended to detail the estimated {{number of children who}} have been orphaned by the AIDS pandemic in Africa.|$|E
5|$|Most {{restaurants}} are furnished <b>with</b> <b>images</b> {{of the company}} founder, Colonel Harland Sanders. As well as dine-in and take-out, many stand-alone KFC outlets offer a drive-through option. KFC offers a limited delivery service in {{a small number of}} markets. Units include express concessions and kiosks which feature a limited menu and operated in non-traditional locations such as filling stations, convenience stores, stadia, theme parks and colleges, where a full scale outlet would not be practical. Average annual sales per unit was $1.2 million in 2013. Worldwide, the daily average number of food orders at an outlet is 250, with most occurring within a two-hour peak-period.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{since then}} the tulip has become indelibly {{associated}} with the Netherlands and all things Dutch. {{it was during this}} period that the tulipiere, a ceramic vase for growing tulips indoors was devised, and the Golden Age of Dutch Painting was replete <b>with</b> <b>images</b> of tulips. Although tulip festivals are held around the world in the spring, the most famous of these is the display at Keukenhof. One of the better-known novels on tulips is The Black Tulip by Alexandre Dumas, père in 1850, dealing with a contest to grow a black tulip in late seventeenth-century Haarlem.|$|E

30|$|From the {{discussion}} in Section 4.1, {{it is evident that}} the MSE is not adequate for assessing the closeness between two images, it is rather good at assessing the distance between them.

5|$|On 16 June 1969, Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 130th Engineer Aviation Brigade was re-designated as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 130th Engineer Brigade and {{activated}} in Pioneer Kaserne, Hanau, Germany. The 130th Engineer Brigade was a {{consolidation of}} V Corps' 37th and 11th Engineer Groups {{into a single}} unit that would provide more efficient command and control. It was subsequently put {{under the command of}} V Corps, as part of the US Army's force in Europe. The brigade received its shoulder sleeve insignia on 23 September 1969, and its distinctive unit insignia on 3 November 1969. Brigade members specially designed these <b>with</b> <b>images</b> alluding to the 1303rd Regiment's battle honors in World War II using scarlet and white, colors signifying US Army engineer units.|$|E
5|$|Sigurður {{has used}} a variety of {{techniques}} to preserve the penises, including preservation in formaldehyde, pickling, drying, stuffing and salting. One particularly large penis taken from a bull has been converted into a walking stick. Many of the museum's exhibits are illuminated by lamps made by Sigurður from rams' testicles. Sigurður has also carved wooden phalluses, which can be found adorning various objects around the museum, and has a bow tie decorated <b>with</b> <b>images</b> of phalluses that he wears on special occasions.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{legislation}} is observed {{with high levels of}} compliance, but not uniformly throughout the country. There are not mandatory fines for smoking transgressions, although the newest 2016 anti-smoking campaign has seen fines issued and offenders threatened <b>with</b> <b>images</b> of them being broadcast on TV. Tobacco packaging warning messages are required on all types of packaging, but their appearance is not regulated in any way. They are usually printed in small print {{on the side of the}} package and only state that smoking is harmful to health. However, the descriptions must state the nicotine and tar content, must not be misleading and do need to be approved by local authorities. Graphic warning images that are now common worldwide have never appeared on packaging.|$|E
