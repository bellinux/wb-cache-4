5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. <b>We</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E
500|$|Parlophone MD Tony Wadsworth was {{enthusiastic}} {{however as}} Coxon recalls, [...] "We played him [...] "Song 2" [...] {{as a bit}} of a test of whether he was on our wavelength. <b>We</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> this was the second single. Course, we had no idea that it would be. He sat there, grinningâ€”'Definitely! Definitely a single!'" ...|$|E
500|$|Gosford Park screenwriter Julian Fellowes {{contacted}} King {{to present}} ideas for a script, {{and according to}} the producer, [...] " [...] seemed to have the whole movie planned out in his head so <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to go ahead and write it. Three months later, this incredibly impressive screenplay showed up on our desks." [...] Fellowes was immediately hired by him and Scorsese. Fellowes chose not to end the film at Albert's death because he was wary of copying [...] "the horror of biopics," [...] where there is simply an important event after important event. Believing it had been done before and that the audience was already familiar with that part of Victoria's history, {{he thought it would be}} better suited for a television series or for another film.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't say that, mamma. You've {{no right}} {{even to be}} angry with him, because it was <b>we</b> who <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that {{there was to be}} no engagement,--after I had promised him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{guess that}} will set {{him off the}} trail," [...] said Chet, with a grin, after the {{envelope}} had been sealed with care. [...] "And <b>we</b> haven't <b>told</b> <b>him</b> any falsehood, either." ...|$|R
60|$|However, before {{night had}} come Hiram {{succeeded in making}} the officer {{understand}} that <b>we</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{no more than the}} truth, for it seemed that this lieutenant came from Concord, and Griffin was intimately acquainted with many of his friends.|$|R
500|$|Personnel {{changes and}} label {{interference}} frustrated The Black Crowes' attempts {{to follow up}} their 1996 album Three Snakes and One Charm. [...] During May and June 1997, they recorded an album called Band, but it was rejected by their label, American Recordings. [...] Lead singer Chris Robinson said American [...] "couldn't go with the vibe" [...] and wanted something more [...] "safe". [...] In August, guitarist Marc Ford was fired due to a heroin habit that impaired his performances. [...] Guitarist Rich Robinson said, [...] "We would be onstage playing 'Remedy', {{and he would be}} playing a completely different song.... <b>We</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> to clean up or get out. [...] We assumed, since he loved music and the band, that he would clean up." [...] Bassist Johnny Colt had been losing interest in the band since the recording of Three Snakes and One Charm; his contributions to that album were minimal, as Rich played bass in his stead on all but one track. Colt quit in October to become a yoga instructor.|$|E
500|$|An Albanian account {{describes}} the dispute as follows: [...] "By violating the formal Albanian-Soviet agreements signed in September 1957 an May 1959, the Soviet government did {{everything in its}} power to put under its control this Albanian base which {{at the same time}} served the defence of the socialist countries... On April 5, 1961, in a letter addressed to the governments of the Soviet Union and the East-European states it resolutely reaffirmed that it accepted only one solution of the problem: the base of Vlora belonged to Albania and all the naval means that were its property should be handed over to Albanian crew as soon as possible. Any other solution was an act which would lead to the unilateral violation {{on the part of the}} Soviet Union of the existing Albanian-Soviet agreements of the years 1957 and 1959." [...] In May 1961 the Soviets began dismantling the base and tried to seize the submarines, seizing some Albanian ships undergoing repairs at Sevastopol in the process. As the Albanian account describes it, [...] "The Soviet sailors and officers carried out numerous provocations, trying by all manner of means to create a pretext for the Soviet military intervention in Albania... On May 26, 1961 it seized in a demonstrative manner 8 submarines, the floating base 'Kotelnikov', as well as the Albanian warships that were laid for repair in the port of Sevastopol. On June 5, 1961 the personnel of Soviet advisers left the base at Vlora, too." [...] Hoxha's account is as follows: Admiral Vladimir Kasatonov of the Black Sea fleet [...] "came to Tirana with the mission of seizing not only the eight submarines... but even the submarines which we had taken over earlier. <b>We</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> bluntly: Either you hand the submarines over to us according to the agreement, or within a short time (we set the date) you must withdraw immediately from the bay... He did not hand over the submarines, but went to Vlora, boarded the command submarine and lined up the others in fighting formation. We gave orders to close the Sazan Narrows and to train the guns on the Soviet ships. Admiral Kasatonov, who had wanted to frighten us, was frightened himself. He was caught like a rat in a trap and if he attempted to implement his plan he might find himself at the bottom of the sea. In these conditions the admiral was obliged to take only the submarines with Soviet crews, and he sailed out of the bay back home with his tail between his legs." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, Mission of Burma reunited {{and began}} playing reunion shows with Bob Weston of Shellac (and {{formerly}} Prescott's Volcano Suns bandmate) replacing Swope at the mixing board and tape manipulation. In an interview Miller relates that [...] "when we approached Bob Weston to fill Martin's position, <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{he could use}} current digital technology which accomplishes Martin's antics in an easier fashion. However, Bob opted for maintaining the original integrity, and uses a tape deck." [...] Weston began using a digital looping box from Electro-Harmonix in 2007 during live performances, but still uses actual tape loops in the studio. [...] Weston regularly joins the band onstage during encores, playing bass while Conley plays second guitar.|$|E
60|$|NEWTE. It must NOT come out! It's too late. If <b>we</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> at the {{beginning}} that he was proposing to marry into his own butler's family--well, it's an awkward situation--he might have decided to risk it. Or he might have cried off.|$|R
60|$|As <b>we</b> went I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{the rest}} of the story--the Angela part. He laid down his {{portmanteau}} and looked at me like an owl through his glasses.|$|R
2500|$|Ansarullah Mawlafizada {{also said}} [...] "the Prophet Muhammad has said {{several times that}} those who convert from Islam should be killed if they refuse to come back, Islam is a {{religion}} of peace, tolerance, kindness and integrity. That is why <b>we</b> have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> if he regrets what he did, then we will forgive him".|$|R
6000|$|... 'His son and heir, {{his son and}} heir! He {{knew all}} at last. <b>We</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> on his death-bed! I swear that <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> and he adopted you!' ...|$|E
60|$|The man {{wanted to}} know how we had come to see him, and all particulars, and <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{listened with}} intense {{interest}} to our wonderful story; but when <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> of old Gagool's frightful end he grew thoughtful.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We rode to Brightling, {{and past}} Sir John's lodges, where the keepers would have shot at us for deer-stealers, {{and we had}} Sir John down into his Justice's chair, and when <b>we</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> our tale and showed him the cow-hide which Sebastian wore still girt about him, he laughed till the tears ran.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was late}} in the {{afternoon}} of the day before your arrival that he called me to his bedside. Only a few hours ago <b>we</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that he must die, and since then he had been very silent. I came and knelt before him, and was commencing a prayer, when he stopped me.|$|R
60|$|But Strickland did not answer. He caught hold of {{the back}} of a chair, and, without warning, went into an amazing fit of hysterics. It is terrible to see a strong man {{overtaken}} with hysteria. Then it struck me that we had fought for Fleete's soul with the Silver Man in that room, and had disgraced ourselves as Englishmen for ever, and I laughed and gasped and gurgled just as shamefully as Strickland, while Fleete thought that we had both gone mad. <b>We</b> never <b>told</b> <b>him</b> what <b>we</b> had done.|$|R
60|$|Here <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{the case}} of our men that were sick; some of them, indeed, were French, and others that could speak French, were {{instructed}} {{to speak to him}} as if they could speak no other tongue, and those the surgeon interpreted; others, who were English, were called Irishmen, and two or three were allowed to be English seamen picked up in the East Indies, as we had seamen, <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>him,</b> of all nations.|$|E
60|$|So <b>we</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all, {{while he}} listened open-mouthed. When {{we came to}} the {{description}} of the Tomb of the Kings his excitement could scarcely be restrained.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good luck," [...] Cox said gloomily. [...] "But {{who ever}} heard of a man turning into a plant? <b>We</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> it wasn't possible, but he just smiled at us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So, before <b>we</b> parted, I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> {{that if he}} had any {{explanations}} or {{apologies to}} make, I should be glad to see him at Kinlossie House. Then I made up my mind to forgive him, and introduce him to you as the man that ran me down in London! This was the little surprise I had in store for you, but the ungrateful creature has never come." ...|$|R
2500|$|Negation occurs {{by using}} the adverb no, in the North East nae, as in A'm no comin (I'm not coming), A'll no learn ye (I will not teach you), or {{by using the}} suffix -na {{sometimes}} spelled nae (pronounced variously , [...] or [...] depending on dialect), as in A dinna ken (I don't know), Thay canna come (They can't come), We coudna hae telt <b>him</b> (<b>We</b> couldn't have <b>told</b> <b>him),</b> and A hivna seen her (I haven't seen her).|$|R
5000|$|... 2003-04 {{proved to}} be a failed season for Rangers, with the {{departure}} of several players from the treble winning season most notably Barry Ferguson and Lorenzo Amoruso. Ricksen, however, {{proved to be}} an important member of the Rangers team which finished second, playing 42 games, despite several injury and disciplinary problems throughout the season. In October 2003 Ricksen pushed then Rangers chairman John McClelland into a swimming pool before a match against Panathinaikos in Athens. The same week he was banned from the Netherlands national team for smashing a hotel door down after a night out. After the events Rangers banned Ricksen from talking to the media and manager McLeish said [...] "We would rather have Fernando on the back pages and <b>we</b> have <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>told</b> <b>him</b> no, that we {{were only}} {{a student of the}} drama. His wife then entered in a towering passion. She didn't ask us if we were drunk. She said: ...|$|E

6000|$|When I {{mentioned}} Mr. Poplington in my {{last letter}} {{in connection with}} the setting sun I was wrong; he was like the rising orb of day, and he filled London with effulgent light. No sooner had we had a talk, and <b>we</b> had <b>told</b> <b>him</b> all that had happened, and finished up by saying what a doleful morning we had had, than he clapped his hand on his knees and said, [...] "I'll tell you what we will do. We will spend the afternoon among the landmarks." [...] And what we did was to take a four-wheeler and go around the old parts of London, where Mr. Poplington showed us a lot of soul-awakening spots which no common stranger would be likely to find for himself.|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} time since I had known him he seemed to have {{expressed}} a doubt of my word. Before <b>we</b> parted I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> that I would undeceive her, start the {{first thing in the morning}} for Richmond and there let her know that he had been blameless. At this he kissed me again. I would expiate my sin, I said; I would humble myself in the dust; I would confess and ask to be forgiven. At this he kissed me once more.|$|R

Les cracked the shits and was abusing me. He was saying {{he wanted to go to}} Sydney. He kept saying 'the bridge'. I took this to mean he wanted to throw the girls off the bridge because he had spoken about this before. There are some bridges on the way to Sydney on the Hume Highway which have great drops." ...|$|R

60|$|On we {{went over}} the rolling plain, and as <b>we</b> {{travelled}} I <b>told</b> <b>him</b> my story, briefly enough, for my mind was too torn with fears {{to allow me to}} talk much. He, too, told me more of his escape and adventures. Now I understood what was that news which had so excited Kambula and his soldiers. It was evident that the Zulu impis had destroyed a great number of the Boers whom they found unprepared for attack, and then had been driven off by reinforcements that arrived from other camps.|$|R
