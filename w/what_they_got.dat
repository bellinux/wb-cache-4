500|$|The {{final scene}} of the episode ended with a tape of a young Olivia in a fire-damaged room, leading to rumors her {{character}} was a fire starter. Torv however discounted this soon after, explaining [...] "I think it's more than that... I think <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> given or <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> taught is much bigger than just starting fire". Jeff Pinkner agreed and elaborated further, [...] "We saw the consequence. We saw that she started a fire {{at the end of}} the last episode, but I think it's a mistake to assume that that's her power. I think the truth is, it's probably a consequence of her ability". This particular scene, as well as the episode's reference to experiments Walter performed on children, comprise the main plot of the season three episode [...] "Subject 13".|$|E

According to Rose, the news coverage included The Sun newspaper comparing Labour's prospective candidate for Tottenham, Bernie Grant– who had emigrated from Guyana in 1963– to an ape, writing that he had given a press conference while peeling a banana and juggling an orange. Grant had caused uproar when he was reported as saying the police had been given a [...] "bloody good hiding," [...] although his statement was also reported as: [...] "The youths around here believe the police were to blame for what happened on Sunday and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> was a bloody good hiding." ...|$|E
500|$|While Monroe {{remains a}} {{cultural}} icon, critics are divided on her legacy as an actress. David Thomson called her {{body of work}} [...] "insubstantial" [...] and Pauline Kael wrote {{that she could not}} act, but rather [...] "used her lack of an actress's skills to amuse the public. She had the wit or crassness or desperation to turn cheesecake into acting – and vice versa; she did what others had the 'good taste' not to do". In contrast, according to Peter Bradshaw, Monroe was a talented comedian who [...] "understood how comedy achieved its effects", and [...] Roger Ebert wrote that [...] "Monroe's eccentricities and neuroses on sets became notorious, but studios put up with her long after any other actress would have been blackballed because <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> back on the screen was magical". Similarly, Jonathan Rosenbaum stated that [...] "she subtly subverted the sexist content of her material" [...] and that [...] "the difficulty some people have discerning Monroe's intelligence as an actress seems rooted in the ideology of a repressive era, when superfeminine women weren't supposed to be smart".|$|E

2500|$|Some FPA members {{disputed the}} FPA's comments, {{including}} New York Times Jerusalem bureau chief Jodi Rudoren, who wrote [...] "every reporter I've met {{who was in}} Gaza during [...] war says this Israeli/now FPA narrative of Hamas harassment is nonsense." [...] Haaretz interviewed many foreign journalists and found [...] "all {{but a few of}} the journalists deny any such pressure". They said Hamas's intimidation was no worse than <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> from the IDF, and said no armed forces would permit reporters to broadcast militarily sensitive information; and that, furthermore, most reporters seldom saw Hamas fighters, because they fought from concealed locations and in places that were too dangerous to approach.|$|E

2500|$|The Third Test {{cemented}} the [...] "Typhoon" [...] reputation. He took 2/68 in {{the first}} innings {{and at the end}} of the fourth day Australia needed 240 to win and were 75–2, with Tyson on 1/11. Over 50,000 Australian fans came on the fifth day to see Neil Harvey and Richie Benaud knock off the remaining 165 runs, but <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> was 'the fastest and most frightening sustained spell of fast bowling seen in Australia'. as Tyson took 6/16 off 6.3 overs from the Richmond End. His 7/27 in the innings was his best Test innings analysis, the best by an England bowler in Australia since Wilfred Rhodes took 8/68 in 1903–04 and has not been bettered since. Australia added only 36 runs, were dismissed for 111 and England won by 128 runs. The game finished well before lunch and the caterers were left with thousands of unsold pies when the crowd deserted the ground.|$|E
2500|$|Australia {{were set}} 240 to win, but Tyson had Arthur Morris caught for 4 by Colin Cowdrey. As [...] "Les Favell got going, his wicket went tumbling", bowled for 30 by Bob Appleyard. Neil Harvey and Richie Benaud took the score to 75/2 by stumps and over 50,000 {{supporters}} {{came on the}} fifth day to see them knock off the remaining runs, but <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>got</b> was [...] "the fastest and most frightening sustained spell of fast bowling seen in Australia". as Tyson sent Australia crashing to 111 all out – the dreaded Triple Nelson – and England won by 128 runs. Australia added only 36 runs that morning as Tyson took 6/16 off 6.3 eight-ball overs, 7/27 in the innings, hurtling down from the Richmond End and slightly into the breeze, but at enormous pace. The first wicket to fall was [...] "a phenomenal piece of cricket" [...] described by Neville Cardus as [...] "Harvey flicked the seventh ball of the morning (from Tyson) round the corner and this time Evans dived full length to the right, clutching the ball in his out-stretched glove". Evans had anticipated Harvey's stroke and had moved to leg before making his [...] "prodigious leap" [...] and [...] "thought this almost his best catch". Richie Benaud chopped the ball onto his stumps trying to hook, Keith Miller managed to block four shooters in a row from Statham, edging the last for four through his pads, but at the other end saw the ball ricochet off the shoulder of his bat, and deflect off Len Hutton's outstretched hand for Bill Edrich to leap backwards and take the catch. Graeme Hole in his final Test innings, edged Brian Statham behind to Evans, Len Maddocks couldn't repeat his first innings heroics and was bowled first ball by a Tyson yorker that he dug out, only to see it spin back into his wicket. Ray Lindwall, fearing a Tyson bouncer after Sydney, played back to a full-length ball and was lbw for a second ball duck, Ron Archer made 15 before he was bowled by a Statham yorker, and Bill Johnston lasted only three balls before he hung his bat outside off-stump and was caught behind off Tyson to end the innings on 111, with captain Ian Johnson unbeaten with 4. The match finished well before lunch and the Melbourne Cricket Club caterers were left with thousands of unsold meat pies as the crowd deserted the ground.|$|E

60|$|The native {{officers}} {{started at}} once.
