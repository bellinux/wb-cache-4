5|$|A recent test of {{this model}} {{involved}} a reciprocal transplants of seedlings of 20 species of trees between clay soils (nutrient rich) and <b>white</b> <b>sand</b> (nutrient poor) to determine whether trade-offs between growth rate and defenses restrict species to one habitat. When planted in <b>white</b> <b>sand</b> and protected from herbivores, seedlings originating from clay outgrew those originating from the nutrient-poor sand, but {{in the presence of}} herbivores the seedlings originating from <b>white</b> <b>sand</b> performed better, likely due to their higher levels of constitutive carbon-based defenses. These finding suggest that defensive strategies limit the habitats of some plants.|$|E

5|$|During the 1930s, The Beverly Hills Hotel became {{increasingly}} popular with Hollywood film stars. Fred Astaire took a shine to the hotel, and enjoyed reading the Daily Variety and The Hollywood Reporter by the pool. Cesar Romero and Carole Lombard were pictured {{together at the}} hotel in 1937. In 1938, the Sand and Pool Club was established at the hotel. It proved extremely popular, with <b>white</b> <b>sand</b> imported from Arizona, which made the pool area look like a beach. The following year, it began hosting fashion shows sponsored by local department stores such as Bullock's Wilshire. In 1940, one of the hotel's long-time patrons, Marlene Dietrich, was instrumental in bringing about a change in policy in the Polo Lounge, which had made it compulsory for women to don skirts which she refused to wear.|$|E

5|$|This {{beautiful}} species, {{which is}} sufficiently characterised to {{distinguish it from}} every other individual of the class, is copiously produced in Dutch Guiana, about 300 paces from the sea, and nearly {{as far from the}} left bank of the river of Surinam. It was communicated to me by the elder Vaillant, who discovered it in 1755 on some raised ground which was never overflowed by the highest tides, and is formed of a very fine <b>white</b> <b>sand,</b> covered with a thin stratum of earth. The prodigious quantity of individuals of this species which grow at the same time, the very different periods of their expansion, the brilliancy and the varied shades of their colours, present a prospect truly picturesque. The fungus was later placed in a new genus, Dictyophora, in 1809 by Nicaise Auguste Desvaux; it was then known for many years as Dictyophora indusiata. Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck placed the species in Hymenophallus in 1817, as H.indusiatus. Both genera were eventually returned to synonyms of Phallus and the species is now known again by its original name.|$|E
5|$|Warring Capulets (Michael Toland) and Montagues (Stephen Goldberg), {{portrayed as}} Steller and California sea lions respectively, have their feud watched sadly by Capulet's only daughter, Juliet (Patricia Trippett). A {{fight on the}} shore is ended when the Prince (Phil Nibbelink), a large and monstrous {{elephant}} seal, appears and warns the two groups that, should there be any more disturbance, the seal who caused it shall be exiled to Shark Island, a fin shaped rock where a shark lives. Romeo (Daniel Tripett), Montague's only son, is depressed, wishing {{to fall in love}} with someone. His humorous friend, Mercutio (Chip Albers), urges him and another of his friends, Benvolio (Sam Gold), to go to a Capulet party later that evening. They attend the party, covered in <b>white</b> <b>sand</b> to look like Capulets, and Romeo falls in love with Juliet at first sight. Juliet, however, was promised by her father to marry the Prince, who attends the party. Romeo and his friends manage to wreak havoc, and are revealed to be Montagues. Later that evening, the play's balcony scene is recreated on a cliff on the beach where a tree grows. Romeo promises Juliet that they shall marry the next morning, and she will not have to marry the Prince.|$|E

40|$|Ecological {{opportunity}} is any change that allows populations to escape selection from competition and predation.

We identified ecological opportunity and tested for ecological release in three lizard colonists of <b>White</b> <b>Sands,</b> New Mexico (Sceloporus undulatus, Holbrookia maculata, and Aspidoscelis inornata). First, we {{provide evidence for}} ecological opportunity by demonstrating reduced species richness and abundance of potential competitors and predators at <b>White</b> <b>Sands</b> relative to nearby dark soils habitats. Second, we characterize ecological release at <b>White</b> <b>Sands</b> by demonstrating density compensation in the three <b>White</b> <b>Sands</b> lizard species and expanded resource use in <b>White</b> <b>Sands</b> S. undulatus. Contrary to predictions from ecological release models, we observed directional trait change but not increased trait variation in S. undulatus.
