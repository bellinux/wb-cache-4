60|$|Anderson {{said all}} this rapidly and low while they <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> {{toward the end}} room which had not been used since Mrs. Anderson's death. The door was ajar. Lenore smelled strong, pungent odors of antiseptics.|$|E

60|$|Later, Phil {{talked to}} her about his longing {{to be a great}} surgeon--in which he had the {{tremendous}} advantage of being almost sincere. He <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> to her room, and said good-night lingeringly, holding her hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come {{out to the}} {{carriage}} with us, please, Mr. Maddison," [...] Helen said {{to him in a}} low tone as Lady Thurwell turned to go; and he <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> between them and out on to the pavement, leaving Sir Allan on the steps.|$|E
60|$|Flora Schuyler {{said nothing}} further, {{and while she}} sat in {{thoughtful}} silence Clavering <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> with Hetty's maid.

50|$|My <b>walk</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> {{is a short}} one, but a lot can {{go through}} you mind in a short walk.

60|$|They <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> The drawing-room was on {{the ground}} floor, a long, dim room that would have looked like a {{converted}} studio but for the absence of bright light. A girl was sitting at the far end by the fireplace. She rose as they entered.|$|E
6000|$|... "Farewell--sweetheart!" [...] he answered, hesitating for {{a moment}} over the words which seemed so strange to him. Then, as though loth to leave him, she <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> by his side, and they looked out {{for a moment}} into the square. A footman was {{standing}} prepared to open the door, but Helen sent him away with a message to her maid.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{a pretty}} flat, of white {{woodwork}} and soft blue walls.

60|$|He <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> {{with the}} {{footsteps}} of a cat, let himself out silently into the empty street and walked with leaden footsteps to his rooms. It was not until he had reached the seclusion of his study that the change came. A sudden dull fury burned in his heart. He poured himself out whisky and drank it neat. Then he seated himself before his desk and wrote. He did not once hesitate. He did not reread a single sentence. He dug up the anger and the bitterness from his heart and set them out in flaming phrases. A sort of lunacy drove him into the bitterest of extremes. His brain seemed fed with the inspiration of his suffering, fed with cruel epigrams and biting words. He dragged his idol down into the dust, scoffed at the piecemeal passion which measures its gifts, the complacency of an analysed virtue, the sense of well-living and self-contentment achieved in the rubric of a dry-as-dust morality. She had failed him, offered him stones instead of bread.--He signed the letter, blotted it with firm fingers, addressed the envelope, stamped it and dropped it himself into the pillar box {{at the corner of}} the street. Then he turned wearily homeward, filled with the strange, almost maniacal satisfaction of the man who has killed the thing he loves.|$|E
5000|$|In 1990, {{the newly}} minted Northern Vance High School befell {{violence}} after one student shot {{another in the}} halls. The student survived the shooting.

5000|$|After {{an ongoing}} argument, John Bennett went {{to pack a}} {{suitcase}} as he told Myrtle to retrieve the handgun he typically carried {{on the road for}} protection.

Still sobbing, Myrtle reached into a drawer with linens and pulled out his [...]32 Colt automatic, and walked into the den. There, she brushed past Charles Hofman and in a moment, and shot at John's back twice in the bathroom of the apartment. John escaped into the hallway, but fell to the ground in their living room.|$|E

50|$|Shortly {{after the}} meeting started, Gordon left his {{partners}} and <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> where {{he claimed to have}} entered the room of a young lady, 22-year-old mob prostitute Nancy Presser, with whom he {{spent the rest of the}} afternoon. He admitted he had talked to some men after leaving the meeting, but police did not release their names. Lou Parkowitz was also present the room and left when the participants began discussing serious matters.

40|$|We <b>walked</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> {{at a brisk}} pace, {{challenged}} {{with the}} task of seeing all the patients before our time for rounds expired. Upon reaching the sought-after room, I inquired “who knows this patient”? One of the residents volunteered that he had admitted the patient, but then he went off duty. Another resident indicated that she had picked the patient up yesterday, but the float resident was on duty during the evening. So together we began to review the patient’s hospitalization, each contributing some information or perspective. Such situations are no longer rare in this era of restricted house officer duty hours. I have just finished another stint as the attending physician on the Cardiology Coronary Care and Inpatient Service at UCSD. The enjoyment of taking care of patients and working with the house staff has been tempered by frustration with the issues wrought by the newly implemented duty-hour restrictions for residents. As everyone involved in a teaching program knows, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) implemented new duty-hour standards mandating that shifts for first-year post-graduate residents be limited to a maximum of 16 h. Complying with this mandat...|$|E

5000|$|Based out of Los Angeles, Gunnar’s stay in Hillside {{happens in}} the context of a {{predominantly}} Black but also Latino population.

He <b>walks</b> <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> looking cleanly dressed and quite dapper in a burgundy suit with white shirt and matching tie. And begins to wait for his guest.|$|R
