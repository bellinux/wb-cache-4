50|$|The larvae feed on Astragalus species, {{including}} Astragalus allochrous, Astragalus thurberi and Astragalus wootonii, {{as well as}} Lathyrus species. Young larvae bore into developing legumes at {{the base}} and cover the opening with white silk. They feed on the seeds. If all seeds of a legume are consumed, a larva may move to another. The larvae have a greenish <b>white</b> <b>to</b> <b>white</b> body and a pale brownish yellow head. They reach a length of 13.1-20.5 mm. Pupation takes place under debris on the soil, usually after overwintering in a hibernaculum.|$|E

50|$|Aspicilia californica (shrubby sunken disk lichen) {{is a small}} <b>white</b> <b>to</b> <b>white</b> mottled gray or gray-green foliose lichen, with stringy, terete, branch-like lobes. It is {{endemic to}} central and {{southern}} California, that grows on organic debris, moss, and rock in chaparral habitats. It attaches to the substrate at several points along the branch-like lobes. It may form areoles when growing on more solid substrates. Apothecia are rare. Lichen spot tests on the cortex and medulla are K+ red, KC-, C-, + orange, and I-. The olive brown Aspicilia filiformis is another fruticose species in this mostly crustose genus, occurring in Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Washington and Montana, with one known location also in California.|$|E
5000|$|Pachysandra procumbens is a shrubby {{ground cover}} which grows 8-12" [...] tall and spreads indefinitely by {{rhizomes}} {{to form a}} dense carpet of matte blue-green leaves mottled with purple and white. It is native to woodlands from North Carolina and Kentucky south to Florida and Texas. Ovate to suborbicular leaves (to 3" [...] long) are coarsely toothed at the apex but untoothed at the base. Leaves are typically deciduous in USDA Zones 5 and 6 but semi-evergreen to evergreen in Zones 7 to 9. Even where evergreen, the leaves may appear worn and tattered by mid winter. Tiny, fragrant, greenish <b>white</b> <b>to</b> <b>white</b> flowers bloom in terminal spikes (2-4" [...] long) in early spring before the new leaves arrive.|$|E
50|$|Males {{will find}} females by {{awaiting}} them on hilltops. Females will {{lay their eggs}} in clusters of about 100 or more {{on the underside of}} host plant leaves. The eggs are pale yellow green but later turn a reddish color. The young larvae feed together and but do not make a nest. They will become solitary when older. The larva is as variable as the adult. It ranges from mostly orange with black spines and stripes to black with a red-orange mid-dorsal stripe to almost all black. All variations have a red-orange head. The chrysalis varies from almost all <b>white</b> <b>to</b> <b>white</b> with black markings to nearly all black. The third instar larva hibernates and also estivates. The bordered patch has three or four broods per year.|$|E

50|$|No {{matter which}} IOL is used, the surgeon {{will need to}} select the {{appropriate}} power of IOL (much like an eyeglass prescription) to provide the patient with the desired refractive outcome. Traditionally, doctors use preoperative measurements including corneal curvature, axial length, and <b>white</b> <b>to</b> <b>white</b> measurements to estimate the required power of the IOL. These traditional methods include several formulas including Hagis, Hoffer Q, Holladay 1, Holladay 2, and SRK/T to name a few. Refractive results using traditional power calculation formulas leave patients within 0.5D of target (Correlates to 20/25 when targeted for distance) or better in 55% of cases and within 1D (Correlates to 20/40 when targeted for distance) or better in 85% of cases. Recent developments in interoperative wavefront technology such as the ORA System from Wavetec Vision Systems, have demonstrated in studies, power calculations that provide improved outcomes, yielding 80% of patients within 0.5D (20/25 or better).|$|E
5000|$|Tomino met {{mechanical}} designer Kunio Okawara when {{he first}} worked in two television series from Sunrise. Tomino liked Okawara's work {{and asked him to}} collaborate with him in his upcoming project. Originally, the anime would be called [...] "Gunboy" [...] but it was renamed Mobile Suit Gundam. The White Base, the mothership of the protagonist crew members, is designed with a 3 plane view method by Kunio Okawara, however, it is not specially designed for the anime series Gundam, it was actually a salvaged design from the anime Invincible Steel Man Daitarn 3. The idea of having a space carrier from Tomino is partly inspired by the earlier science fiction anime Space Battleship Yamato, in which he claimed to be a fan of. It was intended to be in a more realistic black colour, but was changed to white by the order of Sunrise, similar to the colour change of the main mecha Gundam was changed from a grayish <b>white</b> <b>to</b> <b>white,</b> red, blue and yellow. Director Tomino showed great disgust in the colour change, also noticing the unrealistic non-aerodynamic design of it after the show was on air, {{said in an interview that}} such design would never appear in the real world, since it would be a sitting duck from fighter aircraft. Tomino still held a grudge 10 years after the show aired and stated in an interview in Newtype 1989 April issue that the imaginary enemies of Gundam are Sunrise, sponsors and television stations.|$|E

The ring is attached in the upper part, subapical, skirt-like, copious, membranous, persistent, orange-yellow at first, becoming yellow-orange. The saccate volva is smooth, white, with yellow tints on the inner surface, dry, membranous, firmly attached to the stem. The flesh is white, staining light yellow, and stuffed with moderately dense material. The spores measure around approximately 9.0-11.8 (8.0-18.0) × 6.1-7.5(5.5-9.0) µm and are broadly ellipsoid to elongate (rarely cylindric) and inamyloid. Clamps are common at bases of basidia.|$|E
