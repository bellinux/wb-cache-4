But, if we can decide the proportion of asphalt mixture without Marshall test, it is very useful thing and it keep us from wasting the amount of time. That is to say, we hope that, if we decide the proportion of aggregate, we can decide the most suitable amount of asphalt to it's proportion of aggregate without Marshall test. Then, we author make a special study of marshal test being good for deciding the proportion of asphalt mixture, and we made a comparison between theoretical amount of asphalt and a most suitable amount of asphalt of it's experimental result. Theoretical amount of asphalt which we used are the coming, equation of Mckesson, that of Ota and California method etc. The comparison between theoretical amount of asphalt and experimental one is mentioned in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The {{recognition}} of gender from face images {{is an important}} application, especially {{in the fields of}} security, marketing and intelligent user interfaces. We propose an approach to gender recognition from faces by fusing the decisions of SVM classifiers. Each classifier is trained with different types of features, namely HOG (shape), LBP (texture) and raw pixel values. For the latter features we use an SVM with a linear kernel and for the two former ones we use SVMs with histogram intersection kernels. <b>We</b> <b>come</b> to <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> by fusing the three classifiers with a majority vote. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a new dataset that we extract from FERET. We achieve an accuracy of 92. 6 %, which outperforms the commercial products Face++ and Luxand...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} about Bible element in Ukrainian epic songs "Dumy" is {{justified by the}} existence of the biblical texts in the repertuar of the Ukrainian epic singers (limyky and kobzari). It is a well known fact that Pavlo Zytetskuy in his work "The Thoughts about Ukrainian Folk Dumy" (1893) talked about genetic connection between dumy and the community of elderly singers who lived in the church hospitals (and could be the creaters of the kozak epic). His idea did not receive any support among scholars and was not popular at the time. But it had a rational element. As we analyzed Dumy and Bible Psalmz <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> that they do have many common elements in their text and melodic structure and performance. In this article we point out that Bible psalms and epic songs have following common elements: 1. Psalm-rytorical quintative type style with an equal verses; 2. The performance of psalms with gusly, as the Old Testimony mentions and performance of the Dumy with the kobza and lira; 3. The presents in both of the "verbum dictionus" - verbal rhyme; 4. Often use of the inversions, polisidentons and homeoptotons. There are also a lot of other common elements in both genres. For instance, pray like endings as ending formulas, talking like performance style and others. All these element are analyzed through the samples of Bible psalms and dumy texts...|$|R

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this project is to {{evaluate}} the biological and economic feasibility of restoring high-quality forests on mined land, and to measure carbon sequestration and wood production benefits that would be achieved from forest restoration procedures. In this quarterly report we present data that show the spatial distribution of carbon in mine soils. Soil carbon data from deep soil pits from grassland minelands located in Ohio, Virginia, and West Virginia were analyzed to determine the vertical distribution and variability of soil organic carbon (SOC) down to a 2 -m depth. Regression analyses were used to describe and model the distribution by soil depth of C(wt%), BD{sub fines}(g cm{sup - 3 }), and fines (vol%) in mine soils. The volume of excavated mine soil samples was transformed in terms of costs of digging and sampling, including sample collection and preparation, and C(wt%) analysis, {{in order to determine}} the maximum cost-effective depth (MCD) for carbon inventorying on the mined sites analyzed. Based on the horizontal variation of SOC(g m{sup - 2 }), we determined the sampling intensity required to achieve a desired accuracy of the amount of sequestered SOC(g m{sup - 2 }) at certain probability levels. The MCD and sampling intensity measurements were used to determine the minimum detectable difference (MDD) of SOC(g m{sup - 2 }) between two consecutive carbon inventories. We also proposed a method to determine the minimum number of years before a future C inventory event is carried out so that the measured SOC(g m{sup - 2 }) differences were greater than MDD. We used geostatistical analyses procedures to determine spatial dependence predictability of surface SOC(g m{sup - 2 }) data on the minelands analyzed. Kriging techniques were used to create surface SOC(g m{sup - 2 }) maps for the sites in Ohio and West Virginia. The average C sequestration rate in the surface soil layer for the Ohio (age 9) sites was estimated at 124 g C m{sup - 2 } yr{sup - 1 }, and it was estimated at 107 g C m{sup - 2 } yr{sup - 1 } for the West Virginia sites (age 4). Because of the young age of the Virginia sites, 0. 2 and 1 year old, <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to <b>a</b> <b>decision</b> that C sequestration rates would be inappropriate at this stage of their development, as these soils are expected to change with time...|$|R
40|$|A 71 -year-old retired {{engineer}} {{was admitted}} in thedepartment of haematology with {{the diagnosis of}} multiple myeloma. He was subsequently referred to our department with clinically and nerve-conduction test confirmed bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, worse {{on the left side}} than right. He had also associated bilateral Dupuytren’s disease. The initial aim was to do bilateral carpal tunnel release with full exploration and biopsy. However, the patient felt {{that he would not be}} able to manage at home. Therefore, <b>we</b> <b>came</b> to <b>an</b> agreed <b>decision</b> to undertake surgery on the left side first and the right side at a later date. All his haematological investigations were normal with no symptoms and signs of platelet dysfunction. Exploration of left carpal tunnel was done under tourniquet control. It was noted that the soft tissues were bleeding profusely including the wound edges, despite the tourniquet which was at 200 mmHg. Under direct vision, the transverse carpal ligament was opened to reveal haemorrhagic, contused, median nerve throughout its whole length, even proximal to the wound incision point (Fig. 1). There was no evidence of other compression pathology, tumour or aberrant vessels. A number of petechiae were noted within the skin; therefore, the tourniquet was released. At this point, there was no bleeding from the anterior median artery. The haematoma, which was intraneural within the median nerve, was fresh and there was obvious concern that the disease process of myeloma and the use of tourniquet may have exacerbated the intraneural haematoma. Postoperatively, the clotting screen was normal and the patient had a significant recovery. Three months later, right carpal tunnel decompression was undertaken without tourniquet. The entire peri-operative period was uneventful without any particular problems.
