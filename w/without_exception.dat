5|$|The Marshall Court (18011835) issued {{some of the}} {{earliest}} and most influential opinions by the Supreme Court of the United States on the status of aboriginal title in the United States, several of them written by Chief Justice John Marshall himself.

5|$|More sportingly, the 5th century BC tragedian Euripides often {{played with}} the old traditions, mocking them, and through the voice of his {{characters}} injecting notes of doubt. Yet the subjects of his plays were taken, <b>without</b> <b>exception,</b> from myth. Many of these plays were written in answer to a predecessor's {{version of the same}} or similar myth. Euripides mainly impugns the myths about the gods and begins his critique with an objection similar to the one previously expressed by Xenocrates: the gods, as traditionally represented, are far too crassly anthropomorphic.|$|E
5|$|Temples {{built in}} and around the Kalyani region (in the Bidar district) were quite {{different}} from those built in other regions. <b>Without</b> <b>exception,</b> the articulation was nagara, and the temple plan as a rule was either stepped-diamond or stellate. The elevations corresponding to these two plans were similar because star shapes were produced by rotating the corner projections of a standard stepped plan in increments of 11.25 degrees, resulting in a 32-pointed interrupted plan in which three star points are skipped in the centre of each side of the shrine. Examples of stepped-diamond plans surviving in Karnataka are the Dattatreya Temple at Chattarki, the Someshvara Temple in Kadlewad, and the Mallikarjuna and Siddhesvara at Kalgi in the Gulbarga district. The nagara shrine at Chattarki is a stepped diamond of projecting corners with five projections per side. Because of the stepped-diamond plan, the wall pillars have two fully exposed sides, with a high base block decorated with a mirrored stalk motif and two large wall images above. The shapes and decorations {{on the rest of the}} wall pillar have a striking resemblance to the actual pillars supporting the ceiling.|$|E

40|$|An {{exception}} {{is a form}} of a structured jump. A program that uses exceptions can sometimes be written {{in a way that is}} simpler, easier to understand, and more efficient than a similar program written <b>without</b> <b>exceptions.</b> Moreover, program constructs in a language with exceptions are not appreciably more difficult to reason about than those in a language <b>without</b> <b>exceptions.</b> In fact, the weakest preconditions of these constructs make up a nice algebra over functions of two arguments.

Similarly, the UK does not provide certification for tattooists, and blood donations are prohibited <b>without</b> <b>exception</b> for four months following a tattoo.|$|E

Instead, the daughter automaton is left to complete its own development. This is to say, means exist by which automatons may develop via the mechanism of a zygote.|$|E
