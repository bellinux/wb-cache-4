25|$|Hemp is {{possibly}} {{one of the}} earliest plants to be cultivated. An archeological site in the Oki Islands near Japan contained cannabis achenes from about 8000BC, probably signifying use of the plant. Hemp use archaeologically dates back to the Neolithic Age in China, <b>with</b> <b>hemp</b> fiber imprints found on Yangshao culture pottery dating from the 5th millennium BC. The Chinese later used hemp to make clothes, shoes, ropes, and an early form of paper. The classical Greek historian Herodotus (ca. 480 BC) reported that the inhabitants of Scythia would often inhale the vapors of hemp-seed smoke, both as ritual and for their own pleasurable recreation.|$|E
25|$|Kent, as expected, beat Glamorgan, {{but were}} worried on occasion. Having been shaken early on as Glamorgan dug out four early wickets, Kent were lifted by a 267-run {{partnership}} between Darren Stevens (who made 208) and Andrew Hall (133) which helped them {{along the way}} to a final first-innings score of 587, with Min Patel taking 55 balls for a 64 from number nine. Six Glamorgan players were then out in single figures, Amjad Khan taking three for 68, but number three David Hemp stood tall with an unbeaten 171. Glamorgan were 188 for 9 at one point on day two, but survived to stumps to 236 for 9, and just kept going - their number 11, Huw Waters, made 34 from 192 balls, and he added 118 <b>with</b> <b>Hemp,</b> for the second-highest stand of the match.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was carried out}} in Magé, Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil, to evaluate the performance of taro (Colocasia esculenta) intercropped <b>with</b> sunn <b>hemp</b> (Crotalaria juncea), used as green manure. A randomized blocks design with four replicates was used and the soil of the field plots was classified as Haplic Gleysol. Treatments consisted of taro (1) intercropped <b>with</b> unpruned sunn <b>hemp,</b> (2) intercropped <b>with</b> sunn <b>hemp</b> cut at soil level, (3) intercropped <b>with</b> sunn <b>hemp</b> pruned at its mid-height, and (4) in monoculture. The taro was planted in double rows spaced by 1. 0 m. The planting furrows had a space of 0. 5 m, with rhizomes placed at every 3. 0 m. The experimental plot consisted of four 3. 0 m rows and the useful area corresponded to the five central plants in each of the two central rows. The sunn hemp was sown in parallel lines in the spaces between the taro double rows, 120 days after planting the taro. When the sunn hemp was cut at soil level, an accumulation of 211 kg ha- 1 of N was observed. Besides this, the sunn hemp's biomass promoted the cycling of an average 17 kg ha- 1 of P, 85 kg ha- 1 of K, 151 kg ha- 1 of Ca, and 27 kg ha- 1 of Mg. Worth mentioning, it represented also a deposition of 6. 85 Mg ha- 1 of dry substance. Even when pruned at its mid-height, the sunn hemp still provided 60 % of nutrients relatively to the treatment in which it was cut at soil level. In addition to the nutrient supply, the use of taro intercropped <b>with</b> sunn <b>hemp</b> cut at soil level or pruned at mid-height represented efficient alternatives for controlling the spontaneous vegetation and for reducing taro leaf burning by solar radiation, without compromising the yield of taro. In all intercropping systems, taro plants had a larger leaf area and were taller than plants in monoculture...|$|R

6000|$|Moy (pronounce Moÿ) was a {{pleasant}} little village, gathered round a château in a moat. The air was perfumed <b>with</b> <b>hemp</b> from neighbouring fields. At the Golden Sheep we found excellent entertainment. German shells from the siege of La Fère, Nürnberg figures, gold-fish in a bowl, {{and all manner of}} knick-knacks, embellished the public room. The landlady was a stout, plain, short-sighted, motherly body, with something not far short of a genius for cookery. She had a guess of her excellence herself. After every dish was sent in, she would come and look on at the dinner for a while, with puckered, blinking eyes. [...] "C'est bon, n'est-ce pas?" [...] she would say; and when she had received a proper answer, she disappeared into the kitchen. That common French dish, partridge and cabbages, became a new thing in my eyes at the Golden Sheep; and many subsequent dinners have bitterly disappointed me in consequence. Sweet was our rest in the Golden Sheep at Moy.|$|E

Here the houses are much smaller and squalid-looking: they have no verandahs--only a narrow door and tiny, diminutive windows which are not made to open and shut. The pieces of ground around them are also planted, like the others, <b>with</b> <b>hemp</b> and with sunflowers, but even these look less majestic, less prosperous than those which surround the houses higher up the streets; their brown heads are smaller, more sparsely laden with the good oil-bearing seeds, and the stems of the hemp do not look as if they ever would make a thatch.|$|E
40|$|Soil {{salinity}} is a {{major problem}} in the use and management of agricultural in Thailand. Especially in the northeast, those have the lack of natural fertility. Many studies found that the use of organic material can reduce the salinity of the soil.

Experimental design was a randomize complete block with 4 replicates comprised 6 treatments: 1) conventional tillage, 2) tillage <b>with</b> sunn <b>hemp</b> incorporation, 3) tillage with rice straw incorporation, 4) no-tillage, 5) no tillage <b>with</b> sunn <b>hemp</b> mulching and 6) no tillage with rice straw mulching. Soil samples were collected in two peried of rice cultivation; before transplant and two weeks after harvesting. Soil reaction, electrical conductivity, total salt, soil organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and exchangeable potassium were determined by using standard method. The study found that no - tillage <b>with</b> sunn <b>hemp</b> mulching treatment tended to increase soil chemical properties. Thirty eight percent salt content was reduced, organic matter and total nitrogen increased by sixty and forty percent, respectively. The study revealed that adding organic material combination with no - tillage can improve chemical properties and reduce salt content. Therefore, regularly soil improving must be done for soil fertility and crop production...|$|R

After remaining in a dry cellar for nine months the barrels were opened. It was found that the hair had been almost entirely eaten away by the action of the lime, and the mortar consequently broke up and crumbled quite easily. The mortar containing the Manila hemp, on the other hand, showed great cohesion, and required some effort to pull it apart, the hemp fiber being undamaged.|$|R
