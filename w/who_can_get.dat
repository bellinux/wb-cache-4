As Aya rests on a naval vessel, the Ultimate Being is born and attacks the surrounding ships. Aya does battle with the Ultimate Being, but its mitochondria causes it to evolve at an alarming rate.

Later on, Charming catches Snow in the rope trap, although the timeline of their introduction is thrown off, until Hook shows up to say that another woman (Emma) has his ring.

Regina throws a fireball at the helpless Snow White, who appears to die. Her death causes Red to howl as a wolf and Emma to cry over her mother's death.|$|E

[...] One of the testifying {{witnesses}} was Marian Wright, a 27 year-old Yale Law School graduate working with the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund in Mississippi. She told the subcommittee that increased mechanization and requirements that cotton fields lie fallow under federal subsidy stipulations had put thousands of black sharecroppers out of work in the Mississippi Delta. In addition to this, two-parent families were ineligible for many welfare benefits, and most counties in Mississippi had switched welfare programs from one that distributed surplus food to an alternative that required a monthly purchase of food stamps. With little to no income, most households could not produce the necessary funds. As a result, Wright argued, Mississippians were [...] "starving. They're starving, and those <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> the bus fare to go north are trying to go north... I wish that [...] would have a chance to go and just look at the empty cupboards in the Delta and {{the number of people who}} are going around and begging just to feed their children." ...|$|E

[...] Although the costume defined {{each of the three}} characters in Anniyan, there were scenes where Ambi would suddenly become Remo and Remo would become Anniyan. There I made it dramatic to bring out each character." [...] He credited his wife Shailaja Balakrishnan, a psychologist, for helping him in fleshing out the character of Ambi, a person who has multiple personality disorder. In a conversation with film critic Baradwaj Rangan, Shailaja recalled the times the film was being made and spoke of Vikram, saying, [...] "I felt we should live in two houses. It's not easy to live with a man <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> that eccentric, an actor who wants to be that difficult on himself. I wouldn't say he becomes the character, but there's definitely some kind of internalisation." [...] Vikram confessed that he had a tough time during the film's making as playing different characters affected him and he found himself going mad. He added that he would take a break after a 15-day shoot and watch the pigeons on his terrace as a way of dealing with the pressure.|$|E

500|$|The five subtitled DVDs {{released}} by Media Blasters were reviewed by Anime News Network (ANN). The first DVD was declared rental-worthy by ANN, citing the characters as being [...] "a lot of fun" [...] and the series {{as being a}} [...] "very laid-back show" [...] that would work well as a relaxing watch over a weekend. The content, however, was described as getting the series off to a [...] "slow start", with limitations of the first six episodes being the lack in fan service, humor, and that it [...] "struggles to find any other reason to be compelling". The second DVD, containing episodes seven through eleven, was reviewed as failing to [...] "materialize much real plot" [...] {{and content of the}} episodes was described as existing [...] "only to appeal to otaku <b>who</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> excited about moe content".

In the fourth DVD, containing episodes seventeen through twenty-one, [...] "the series' romantic side does finally pay off with a romantic arc that actually engages". In the fifth and final DVD containing the last five episodes, the Hikari and Amane relationship is described as lacking chemistry, although the Nagisa and Shizuma pairing is regarded as satisfying.|$|E
