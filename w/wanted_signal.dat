25|$|Noise {{is a term}} {{often used}} to refer to an {{unwanted}} sound. In science and engineering, noise is an undesirable component that obscures a <b>wanted</b> <b>signal.</b> However, in sound perception it can often be used to identify the source of a sound and is an important component of timbre perception (see above).|$|E
50|$|In FM systems {{where the}} IF stage gain {{is very high}} and the stage is {{designed}} to be linear, it is likely that if the unwanted signal is at least 10 dB weaker than the <b>wanted</b> <b>signal</b> that the capture effect will result in the receiver ignoring the unwanted signal. If however the unwanted signal is stronger than the <b>wanted</b> <b>signal</b> then {{it is likely that the}} receiver will be unable to demodulate the <b>wanted</b> <b>signal.</b> This is related to the normal method of jamming FM systems, to jam an FM signal it is normal to transmit a signal which is 10 dB stronger (at the front end of the target receiver) and is within the plateau of most narrow IF stage.|$|E

50|$|In a {{narrowband}} system {{such as a}} {{radio communication}} system, unwanted outputs such as X-Y and 2X+Y will be remote from the wanted band and so be ignored by the system. In contrast, 2X-Y and 2Y-X will {{be close to the}} <b>wanted</b> <b>signals.</b> These so-called third order distortion products (third order as m+n = 3) tend to dominante the non-linear distortion of narrowband systems.|$|R
40|$|Wind {{noise is}} one of the major {{concerns}} of outdoor microphone signal acquisition. Filtering and removal of wind noise are known to be difficult due to its broadband and time varying nature. This paper proposes the use of singular spectrum analysis to address the problem of microphone wind noise removal and/or separation. The paper is presented from the context of reducing microphone wind noise when deploying outdoor acoustic sensing in smart city applications and soundscapes monitoring. But concepts and methods can be generalized beyond its original scope. The method includes two complementary stages, namely decomposition and reconstruction. The first stage decomposes mixed signals in eigen-subspaces, selects and groups the principal components according to their contributions to wind noise and <b>wanted</b> <b>signals</b> in the singular spectrum domain. The second stage is used to reconstruct the signals back to the time domain, resulting in the separation of wind noise and <b>wanted</b> <b>signals.</b> Following a brief review of the wind noise removal problem, this paper presents the algorithm and some experimental results, and discusses the potentials of the singular spectrum analysis for microphone wind noise reduction...|$|R

50|$|In {{instrumentation}} systems, the use {{of differential}} inputs with high common mode rejection ratio, to minimise the effects of induced AC signals on the parameter to be measured, is widespread. It may also be possible to introduce narrow notch filters at the power frequency and its lower harmonics; however, {{this can not be}} done in audio systems due to the objectionable audible effects on the <b>wanted</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In such a radio receiver, a local {{oscillator}} (LO) {{is used to}} heterodyne or [...] "beat" [...] against the incoming radio frequency (RF), generating sum and difference frequencies. One of these {{will be at the}} intermediate frequency (IF), and will be selected and amplified. The radio receiver is responsive to any signal at its designed IF frequency, including unwanted signals. For example, with a LO tuned to 110 MHz, there are two incoming signal frequencies that can generate a 10 MHz IF frequency. A signal broadcast at 100 MHz (the <b>wanted</b> <b>signal),</b> and mixed with the 110 MHz LO will create the sum frequency of 210 MHz (ignored by the receiver), and the difference frequency at the desired 10 MHz. However, a signal broadcast at 120 MHz (the unwanted signal), and mixed with the 110 MHz LO will create a sum frequency of 230 MHz (ignored by the receiver), and the difference frequency also at 10 MHz. The signal at 120 MHz is called the image of the <b>wanted</b> <b>signal</b> at 100 MHz. The ability of the receiver to reject this image gives the image rejection ratio (IMRR) of the system.|$|E

Single-ended amplifiers normally operate in Class A; push-pull amplifiers can also operate in Classes AB or B [...] without excessive net distortion, due to cancellation.|$|R

50|$|Early in the {{development}} of radio technology it was recognized that the signals emitted by transmitters had to be 'pure'. Spark-gap transmitters were outlawed once better technology was available as they give an output which is very wide in terms of frequency. The term spurious emissions refers to any signal which comes out of a transmitter other than the <b>wanted</b> <b>signal.</b> In modern equipment there are three main types of spurious emissions: harmonics, out of band mixer products which are not fully suppressed and leakage from the local oscillator and other systems within the transmitter.|$|E
50|$|Signal leakage paths {{can occur}} in the receiver. Local-{{oscillator}} energy can leak through the mixer stage to the antenna input and then reflect back into the mixer stage. The overall effect is that the local oscillator energy will self-mix and create a DC offset signal. The offset may {{be large enough to}} overload the baseband amplifiers and prevent receiving the <b>wanted</b> <b>signal.</b> There are design modifications that deal with this issue, but they add to the complexity of the receiver. The additional design complexity often outweighs the benefits of a direct-conversion receiver.|$|E
5000|$|If, for example, a {{domestic}} HiFi system has a grounded turntable and a grounded preamplifier {{connected by a}} thin screened cable (or cables, in a stereo system) using phono connectors, the cross-section of copper in the cable screen(s) {{is likely to be}} less than that of the protective ground conductors for the turntable and the preamplifier. So, when a current is induced in the loop, there will be a voltage drop along the signal ground return. This is directly additive to the <b>wanted</b> <b>signal,</b> and will result in objectionable hum. For instance, if a current [...] of 1mA at the local power frequency is induced in the ground loop, and the resistance [...] of the screen of the signal cable is 100 milliohms, the voltage drop will be [...] = 100 microvolts. This is a significant fraction of the output voltage of a moving coil pickup cartridge, and a truly objectionable hum will result.|$|E

5000|$|The {{homodyne}} {{was developed}} in 1932 {{by a team of}} British scientists searching for a design to surpass the superheterodyne (two stage conversion model). The design was later renamed the [...] "synchrodyne". Not only did it have superior performance due to the single conversion stage, but it also had reduced circuit complexity and power consumption. The design suffered from the thermal drift of the local oscillator which changed its frequency over time. To counteract this drift, the frequency of the local oscillator was compared with the broadcast input signal by a phase detector. This produced a correction voltage which would vary the local oscillator frequency keeping it in lock with the <b>wanted</b> <b>signal.</b> This type of feedback circuit evolved into what is now known as a phase-locked loop. While the method has existed for several decades, it had been difficult to implement due largely to component tolerances, which must be of small variation for this type of circuit to function successfully.|$|E
50|$|NTSC {{uses this}} process unmodified. Unfortunately, this {{often results in}} poor color {{reproduction}} due to phase errors in the received signal, caused sometimes by multipath, but mostly by poor implementation at the studio end. With the advent of solid state receivers, cable TV, and digital studio equipment for conversion to an over-the-air analog signal, these NTSC problems have been largely fixed, leaving operator error at the studio end as the sole color rendition weakness of the NTSC system. In any case, the PAL D (delay) system mostly corrects these kind of errors by reversing the phase of the signal on each successive line, and the averaging the results over pairs of lines. This process is achieved {{by the use of}} a 1H (where H = horizontal scan frequency) duration delay line. (A typical circuit used with this device converts the low frequency color signal to ultrasound and back again). Phase shift errors between successive lines are therefore cancelled out and the <b>wanted</b> <b>signal</b> amplitude is increased when the two in-phase (coincident) signals are re-combined.|$|E

40|$|In {{smart antenna}} applications, the {{adaptive}} beamforming technique {{is used to}} cancel interfering signals (placing nulls) and produce or steer a strong beam toward the target signal according to the calculated weight vectors. Minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) beamforming is capable of determining the weight vectors for beam steering; however, its nulling level on the interference sources remains unsatisfactory. Beamforming {{can be considered as}} an optimization problem, such that optimal weight vector should be obtained through computation. Hence, in this paper, a new dynamic mutated artificial immune system (DM-AIS) is proposed to enhance MVDR beamforming for controlling the null steering of interference and increase the signal to interference noise ratio (SINR) for <b>wanted</b> <b>signals...</b>|$|R
40|$|Time {{correlation}} and decorrelation {{are well}} established tools {{to improve the}} {{signal to noise ratio}} of a system, yet they are often poorly understood. When several unwanted signals are correlated they are much easier to remove from uncorrelated <b>wanted</b> <b>signals</b> than vice versa, where a much poorer improvement is possible. A case in point is the removal of wind noise from microphone signals. The situation is further compounded when one or other of the signals is only partially correlated, or different spectral content is differently correlated. This paper looks at the theoretical improvement in signal to noise ratio when either the signal or the noise are correlated to different degrees. Application to real microphone signals and noise is discussed...|$|R

In this study, a conventional reflector antenna is given adaptive control by placing additional feeds in the reflector focal plane. The antenna effectively becomes a Multiple Beam Antenna (MBA).

To maximise {{the strength of the}} <b>wanted</b> <b>signals</b> (and to minimise reception of unwanted signals of the opposite polarization), the probe is aligned with the polarization of the incoming signals. This is most simply achieved by adjusting the LNB's skew; its rotation about the waveguide axis. To remotely select between the two polarizations, and to compensate for inaccuracies of the skew angle, it used to be common to fit a polarizer in front of the LNB's waveguide mouth. This either rotates the incoming signal with an electromagnet around the waveguide (a magnetic polarizer) or rotates an intermediate probe within the waveguide using a servo motor (a mechanical polarizer) but such adjustable skew polarizers are rarely used today.|$|R
