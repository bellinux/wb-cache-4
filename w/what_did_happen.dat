25|$|Kant {{himself did}} not see himself as a relativist, and was aiming to give {{knowledge}} a more solid basis, but as Richard J. Bernstein remarks, reviewing this same critique of Gadamer:Once we begin to question {{whether there is a}} common faculty of taste (a sensus communis), we are easily led down the path to relativism. And this is <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>happen</b> after Kant - so much so that today it is extraordinarily difficult to retrieve any idea of taste or aesthetic judgment that is more than the expression of personal preferences. Ironically (given Kant's intentions), the same tendency has worked itself out with a vengeance with regards to all judgments of value, including moral judgments.|$|E
25|$|The {{collection}} {{at that time}} went from the small four-toed forest-dwelling Orohippus from the Eocene through three-toed species such as Miohippus to species more like the modern horse. By looking at their teeth he could see that, as the size grew larger and the toes reduced, the teeth changed from those of a browser to those of a grazer. All such changes {{could be explained by}} a general alteration in habitat from forest to grassland. And, it is now known, that is <b>what</b> <b>did</b> <b>happen</b> over large areas of North America from the Eocene to the Pleistocene: the ultimate causative agent was global temperature reduction (see Paleocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum). The modern account of the evolution of the horse has many other members, and the overall appearance of the tree of descent is more like a bush than a straight line.|$|E

50|$|In mathematics, monodromy is {{the study}} of how objects from {{mathematical}} analysis, algebraic topology, algebraic geometry and differential geometry behave as they 'run round' a singularity. As the name implies, the fundamental meaning of monodromy comes from 'running round singly'. It is closely associated with covering maps and their degeneration into ramification; the aspect giving rise to monodromy phenomena is that certain functions we may wish to define fail to be single-valued as we 'run round' a path encircling a singularity. The failure of monodromy can be measured by defining a monodromy group: a group of transformations acting on the data that encodes <b>what</b> <b>does</b> <b>happen</b> as we 'run round'.|$|R

Is there any other important source of anisotropy or will the system be magnetically isotropic despite its crystalline structure? These questions can be addressed by investigating Gadolinium (Gd) compounds by magnetic diffraction experiments. Gd has a very large spin moment, but no orbital moment in its ground state (L= 0), and therefore it is not sensitive to the crystal field. The isotropic interactions (such as RKKY exchange interactions etc.) dominate the magnetic properties and lead to ordering temperatures of more than 100 K for a large number of Gd compounds.
