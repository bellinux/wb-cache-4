25|$|So there’s no real choice this year, {{but what}} the Occupy {{movement}} has done has taken {{us back to the}} era when Martin Luther King was in the Sixties said ‘This is unacceptable!’ We cannot have a situation where everything is owned by the 1% {{in the same way that}} Martin Luther King said in the Riverside Church that we have a government that is the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today, we are exploiting the planet, and that is unacceptable. So the memory of Martin Luther King – it’s about dreams, but it’s also about the courage to draw a line right there and say ‘We cannot go on crossing this line. This is a moral line, this is a line concerning power and the world’. And there today America is on that line. And people know that <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to – these years after Martin Luther King was murdered – is completely unacceptable, and it’s his example that will inspire us as we go forward into this year.|$|E

500|$|Shooting often ran for 12 {{hours at}} a time and led to {{frequent}} minor injuries among the cast and production staff, while some developed intense feelings of claustrophobia in the confined space. Gordon suggests that the uncomfortable working conditions made the performances of the cast more realistic, but concedes that although, [...] "I think all this paid off in terms of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> on the screen for the budget, but the circumstances were very difficult." [...] In the absence of suitable facilities inside the caves, the personnel established administrative, dressing and make-up rooms in a car park some distance from the filming area. Co-writer Nick Maley reprised his role as a special effects technician to produce the infant twin props that appear in the climax of the film.|$|E

500|$|... "Sectionals" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics. TV Guide Natalie Abrams felt it ended {{the beginning of}} the season on a [...] "high note", while Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal commented: [...] "You couldn’t have asked for a better cliffhanger of a fall finale". IGN's Eric Goldman rated the episode 9/10, calling it [...] "very satisfying", and Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times commended it as [...] "fine television." [...] James Poniewozik of Time wrote: [...] "I'm not sure I expected or wanted a feel-good ending out of the first half of Glee. But <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> from [...] "Sectionals" [...] left me feeling very good about where the show is going this spring." [...] In contrast, Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger, felt that the episode brought too many storylines to a head at once, [...] "not allowing all to have as much impact as they might have had the big developments been spaced out". Sepinwall commented, however, that the acting and especially singing performances were [...] "uniformly strong." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{television}} {{critics were}} less {{enthusiastic about the}} episode. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club felt that the episode was inferior to the previous episode, deeming it tedious. He wrote, [...] "'Bloodletting' was a step down from last week's première, mostly because it focused more on conversations than scares. Much as I want this show {{to find some way}} to do its characters right, those conversations were bland, providing no new information beyond, hey, it would suck to have your son get shot in front of you, huh?" [...] Concluding his review, Handlen gave the episode a 'B–' grade. In concurrence, Nate Rawlings of Time stated: [...] "For an episode titled 'Bloodletting' there was surprisingly little of it last night. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> instead were outpourings of emotion and frustration. Two entries in, and it's already clear that the show wants to strike a balance between gore and humanity." [...] Andrew Conrad of the Chicago Tribune was unhappy with the episode; he expressed disappointment with the low amount of zombie sequences, writing, [...] "It must be a bit of a relief for the show's make-up department, but I'd like to see at least one walker every ten minutes or so." ...|$|E
500|$|Musician Harry Connick Jr., {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Leo. He {{received}} a call from co-creators Kohan and Max Mutchnick asking him to appear on Will & Grace, and agreed to do it after learning that it was his wife's favorite show. According to Debra Messing, who plays Grace, Kohan and Mutchnick had a specific vision of Grace's husband from the start. They thought it was important that Grace meet a [...] "menschy, nice Jewish man who happens to be a hottie, and that's <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> with Harry Connick Jr," [...] she said. According to The Nation magazine, {{this was the first time}} that a prime-time sitcom showed a Jewish protagonist (Grace) marrying inside the faith. Connick, who is part-Jewish, said he enjoyed the fact that he was not asked to sing on the show, because [...] "it throws you out of character a little bit when that stuff happens. It's been great just doing the acting thing." [...] Messing, in discussing Grace and Leo's relationship, commented that it is [...] "unlike anything that Grace has ever been a part of before and just the little that we've done so far, it feels wonderful to be playing with Harry." [...] In another interview, also discussing the characters' relationship, she explained, [...] "...bringing Leo into it and making it a viable and potent relationship for Grace, that's never happened before. I think she's a little less frenetic and neurotic, and I think that really being in love markedly changes Grace. That sexual energy in a great way has shaken things up, because it is the greatest threat to the friendship of Will and Grace to date." ...|$|E

2500|$|All of {{the movie}} themes and mini-games were {{conceived}} by the creative-design team, which they decided the movie themes would have an old B-movie feel. Trowers notes {{the making of the}} mini-games to be [...] "quite an organic process": [...] "Sometimes we'd have a movie and we'd say OK, we want the player to do this in the scene, which is the action we want, so try to think of a game idea for this. But other times we'd be thinking, [...] "Oh, you know <b>what,</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> this great idea for a game and these are the essential actions we can get out of it, {{how are we going to}} use it in movies?" [...] So it was really a three-way process, trying to figure out what we could get people to do, what would be fun, how it would fit in the movie—it wasn't just one process of doing it, it had to go both ways." [...] There had also been a few more movie ideas, but they were left out of the game.|$|E
2500|$|T.I. {{was also}} {{able to work with}} fellow Atlanta rapper, Outkast's André 3000 for the first time after years of trying to collaborate: [...] "We've been trying to put this {{particular}} collaboration together since the King album. Every album since King I've called Andre and been like 'Hey, I'm working on an album, let's get together.' And he'd say 'Okay, let's see <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> that makes sense.' And we've met a handful of times. This {{is the first time that}} it ... came together. I'm extremely proud, honored, and privileged." [...] And while T.I. admits that André 3000 out shined on [...] "Sorry," [...] he’s not mad: [...] "He did get down on me on my record, I can’t front," [...] laughs Tip. [...] "But to me I’m honored and it’s a pleasure that he would even choose my record to do that on." [...] The song was co-produced by former Grand Hustle intern Sir Clef alongside Jazze Pha, the latter of whom has helmed tracks for T.I. such as [...] "Chooz You" [...] and [...] "Let's Get Away".|$|E

6000|$|Thereupon, {{rapidly and}} concisely, the ranger {{reported}} what Dunn had said, {{and the attorney}} listened thoughtfully without speaking to the end; then he added: [...] "That tallies with <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> from Ballard." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Talk is helpful, talk is needful," [...] {{the young}} man was saying, [...] "but <b>what</b> <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> to do is to lift the subject out of the furrow of indisciplined talk and place it on the threshing-floor of {{practical}} discussion." ...|$|R

60|$|I reckon, that, {{including}} the gold our shallop brought, and <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>got</b> on shore where we lay, we brought away about twenty-four pounds weight of gold; {{the expense of}} which we could not value at above ten or eleven pounds in England, put it all together; and reckoning for all the provisions we got there, which supplied us for twenty days after we came away.|$|E
