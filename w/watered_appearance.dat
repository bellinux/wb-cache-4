5000|$|In textiles, a moire ( [...] or [...] ), {{less often}} moiré, is a fabric with a wavy (<b>watered)</b> <b>appearance</b> {{produced}} mainly from silk, but also wool, cotton and rayon. The <b>watered</b> <b>appearance</b> is usually {{created by the}} finishing technique called calendering. Moire effects are also achieved by certain weaves, such as varying {{the tension in the}} warp and weft of the weave, or by running the fabric through engraved copper rollers. Silk treated in this way is sometimes called watered silk.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Flood {{appearance}} {{in urban areas}} is commonly caused by the urban areas precipitation’s themselves. The reason for their appearance is often inevitable e. g. extreme rainfalls, hydrological runoff conditions or the degree of drainage systems development, but sometimes the damages caused by flood appearance {{are the result of}} methodological mistakes in hydrological calculations. Present paper analyses high <b>water</b> <b>appearances</b> in urban areas from the aspect of hydrological practice. The most frequent causes of high <b>water</b> <b>appearances</b> are presented and much more detailed evaluation of problems of high waters in urban catchment areas as the consequence of precipitation is performed. The main principles of drainage systems planning for negative effect elimination of high waters is described. The emphasis is given on the hydrological component of the mentioned problem. The actual problem of urban precipitation water drainage system planning is given on the example of Škurinjski potok catchment area in Rijeka...|$|R

Covering an area of about 27 km 2 and with 873 inhabitants (after preliminary result of 2001 census) they form a small separated group in the southernmost part of the Croatian islands belonging to the Dubrovnik archipelago.

50|$|Mechanisms {{that are}} used for Aquatic Bio{{monitoring}} are monitoring and assessing aquatic species and ecosystems, monitoring the behavior of certain aquatic species and assessing any changes in species behavior, and looking at contaminants {{in the water and}} their effect on marine life. Water is graded on several scales. One is the <b>water’s</b> <b>appearance.</b> Is the <b>water</b> clear, cloudy, full of algae. Next, water is graded on its chemistry levels. How much of each enzyme or mineral located in the water is extremely important. Any changes in any of these factors can change the water’s environment overall and therefore change how life in the water is. These changes can severely impact aquatic life. Certain contaminants, such as metal and certain organic waste, can cause death of some individuals and which could ultimately cause extinction to certain species. This would be detrimental to not only aquatic ecosystems, but also to some ecosystems on land as well. Extinction of any species can have a ripple effect and can cause disruption in other biomes and ecosystems.|$|R

40|$|Handling {{of water}} {{accumulation}} {{is still a}} key issue in fuel cell research. The presented study evaluates the condensate removal capability of three different flow field designs. The designs are compared regarding cell voltage at different current densities using the same operating conditions. The investigated type of meander shaped channels {{with a high degree}} of parallelization shows the best performance with stationary water thickness inside channels throughout the analyzed current densities. To develop and evaluate a condensate removal criterion for fuel cell construction, the pressure drop of each flow field is correlated to the <b>water</b> <b>appearance</b> visualized with neutron radiography. For a further insight, computational fluid dynamics simulation is used to calculate pressure drops present inside the characteristic regions of each flow field. Thus, a characteristic design limit of 20 mbar m 1 for meander shaped channels is proven to ensure the absence of channel blockage. The meander shaped channels show specific pressure drops around this limit depending on water production and gas supply. The two other analyzed flow fields suffer from higher channel filling rates the investigated straight channels with less parallelization fill up with time, while the pattern structured flow field demonstrates gravity as an additional influence on condensate remova...|$|R
