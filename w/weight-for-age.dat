5|$|On {{his first}} start after the Derby, St. Gatien was sent to Royal Ascot for the Gold Vase, in which he faced the top class older horses Corrie Roy (who started favourite) and Tristan at <b>weight-for-age</b> over two miles. Corrie Roy made the running until the straight, when Wood moved St. Gatien up to challenge. The Derby winner quickly {{took control of the}} race and pulled away to win easily by four lengths from Corrie Roy, with Tristan a remote third. Later at the same meeting Corrie Roy won the Alexandra Plate, while Tristan beat Harvester in the Hardwicke Stakes.|$|E
25|$|On 4 April Cadland carried top {{weight in}} the Oatlands Stakes and {{finished}} second to the filly Varna, to whom he was conceding seventeen pounds. At the next meeting he won a £100 Sweepstakes, conceding twenty-four pounds to the filly Galopade. On the following day he dead-heated with Varna over three miles at <b>weight-for-age</b> and then beat the filly in a run-off. In {{the course of this}} meeting Cadland became the property of Mr E. Peel and ran for his new owner in his race against Varna.|$|E
25|$|On his four-year-old debut, Isonomy carried 124 {{pounds in}} the Newmarket Handicap on 15 April and started 2/1 favourite. Among his opponents was the American horse Parole, who was not {{regarded}} as a serious threat by the British racegoers and started 100/15 fourth choice in the betting despite receiving eight pounds. Parole took the lead at half way and drew clear. Although Isonomy made steady progress {{he was unable to}} catch the leader and finished second, beaten one and a half lengths. Gretton then challenged Parole's owners to a £10,000 <b>weight-for-age</b> match race between the horses, but his offer was declined.|$|E
25|$|Unlike many three-year-old champions, Sunline {{made the}} {{transition}} to <b>weight-for-age</b> racing as four-year-old. First-up, she scored a win over the multiple Group One winner Tie the Knot in the Warwick Stakes, and was installed ante-post favourite for the $3 million WS Cox Plate at Moonee Valley. At her next two starts, Trevor McKee then {{tried to get the}} mare settle in her races, but she was narrowly defeated in the Theo Marks Quality (by Adam) and the George Main Stakes (by Shogun Lodge). Her final lead-up to the Cox Plate was a close fourth under 56.5 kilograms (8 st 11lb) in the Epsom Handicap.|$|E
25|$|Victoire Pisa (Japanese ヴィクトワールピサ) is {{a retired}} Japanese Thoroughbred racehorse and active sire. After winning three of his four starts as a juvenile, the colt won the Satsuki Shō at Nakayama Racecourse in April 2010. After an {{unsuccessful}} campaign in Europe he returned to Japan to win the <b>weight-for-age</b> invitational Arima Kinen in December. In the following spring {{he was sent to}} Dubai where he raced {{for the first time on}} a synthetic track in the Dubai World Cup. He defeated an international field to become the first Japanese-trained horse to win the world's most valuable race. His subsequent career was restricted by injury problems and he was retired at the end of 2011.|$|E
25|$|The filly {{was never}} entered {{for any of}} the British Classic Races but proved herself the best of her {{generation}} by beating the winners of both The Derby and The Oaks in the space of three days at Newmarket in October 1831. In the following year she won the Ascot Gold Cup, the year's most important <b>weight-for-age</b> race in a run-off after being held to a dead heat by the St Leger winner Rowton. From the summer of 1832, few owners were willing to try their horses against her and she won several prizes by walkover or forfeit. She was retired from racing after sustaining an injury in the spring of 1834. She made little impact as a broodmare and died in 1841.|$|E
25|$|Petrarch (foaled 1873), was a British Thoroughbred racehorse and sire who won two British Classic Races in 1876. In {{a career}} that lasted from October 1875 to October 1878 he ran sixteen times and won eight races. In 1875, Petrarch won the Middle Park Stakes on his only {{appearance}} of the season. As a three-year-old in 1876 he won {{two of the three}} races which comprise the Triple Crown, taking the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket and the St Leger at Doncaster. He finished unplaced when favourite for The Derby. As a four-year-old he won three races including the two and a half mile Ascot Gold Cup which at that time was regarded as the most important <b>weight-for-age</b> race in the world. Petrarch was regarded by contemporary experts as a brilliant, but inconsistent performer. After winning once as a five-year-old in 1878 he was retired to stud where he became a successful sire of winners.|$|E
25|$|Nine {{days after}} her victory at Epsom, Miss Jummy was sent to France to contest the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp Racecourse. In a field of six colts and two fillies for the £4,000 prize, she started 7/2 second {{favourite}} behind Minting. She raced in second place {{for much of the}} 3000 metre distance, but tired on the heavy ground and was virtually pulled up by Watts in the closing stages. On her next appearance, Miss Jummy took part in the inaugural running of the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park, which, with a first prize of £10,000, was the most valuable race ever run in Britain. The race was run over ten furlongs at <b>weight-for-age,</b> although the winners of certain major races, including the Oaks, had to carry a seven pound penalty. She started a 40/1 outsider and finished sixth of the twelve runners behind the six-year-old Bendigo. Miss Jummy was sent to Goodwood in late July and ran twice: after running second to the Duke of Westminster's colt Whitefriar in the Gratwicke Stakes she won the ten furlong Nassau Stakes from three opponents at odds of 11/4, beating Argo Navis into second place for the fourth time.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the start}} of the 1885 season, Hammond {{announced}} that although St. Gatien would be entered for the most important handicap races, he would be mainly aimed at the major <b>weight-for-age</b> staying races. In spring however, all of Hammond's plans were placed in jeopardy when St. Gatien fell seriously ill with what was described as [...] "pleuro-pneumonia", putting his future as a racehorse in considerable doubt.|$|E
500|$|At Ascot, St. Gatien {{bypassed}} the staying events and ran instead in a Rous Memorial Stakes over one mile. He raced in third {{before taking the}} lead in the straight and in a well-contested finish, he held off the three-year-old St. Michael, to whom he was conceding twenty-four pounds, to win by a head. The Eclipse Stakes took place on July 23 over ten furlongs, at <b>weight-for-age,</b> with the winners of major races carrying extra weight [...] "penalties". St. Gatien started at 9/4 in a field of twelve, with Bendigo, receiving three pounds, going off the 6/4 favourite. St. Gatien started well and was settled by Wood to race just behind the leaders. In the straight he made his challenge but could never reach the lead and finished third, beaten three lengths and half a length by Bendigo and Candlemas.|$|E
500|$|On September 15, Secretariat {{returned}} to Belmont Park in the inaugural Marlboro Cup, which was {{originally intended to}} be a match race with stablemate Riva Ridge, the 1972 Derby and Belmont Stakes winner. After Secretariat's loss in the Whitney, the field was expanded to invite top horses from across the country. [...] Entries included 1972 turf champion and top California stakes winner Cougar II, Canadian champion Kennedy Road, 1972 American champion three-year-old colt Key to the Mint, Travers winner Annihilate 'Em (the only other three-year-old in the race), and Onion. Riva Ridge was assigned top weight of 127 pounds (one pound over the <b>weight-for-age</b> scale), Key to the Mint and Cougar II were at 126 pounds, scale weight, while Secretariat was at 124, three pounds over scale for his age. The field included five champions, and the seven starters had won 63 stakes races between them.|$|E
500|$|He {{then stepped}} up to twelve furlongs for Britain's most prestigious <b>weight-for-age</b> race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, {{for which he was}} made 4/6 (0.67-1) favourite. With no three-year-old in the field, the race {{did not appear to be}} up to its usual standard, and his main {{opponent}} was expected to be Youmzain who had finished second in the Ascot race and the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 2007 and had more recently won the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. Duke of Marmalade was settled by Murtagh in the middle of the field before being switched to the outside in the straight and overtaking Red Rock Canyon entering the final furlong. He was immediately challenged and headed by the Michael Stoute-trained Papal Bull but [...] "rallied gamely" [...] to regain the lead close to the finish and win by a half a length. Murtagh was keen to praise the horse's speed and attitude, saying [...] "mine has all that makes a real champion. He looked the other horse in the eye and ate ground. He has that will to win." ...|$|E
500|$|St. Gatien, who had {{not been}} entered in the St. Leger, did not {{reappear}} until October 7 when he ran in the Cesarewitch Stakes at Newmarket. In the two and a quarter mile handicap he was assigned a weight of 122 pounds, meaning that he carried more weight {{than any of the other}} runners except for the six-year-old Corrie Roy and the four-year-old Florence, the winner of the Grosser Preis von Baden. No three-year-old had ever won the race with such a weight, the previous record being 118 carried by Robert the Devil in 1880. St. Gatien, who looked [...] "magnificent" [...] before the race, was restrained by Wood towards the back of the twenty runner field before being moved into contention two furlongs out. He was unable to obtain a clear run and had to be switched to the outside as the lead was disputed by Polemic and the French-trained Archiduc. Once in the clear, St. Gatien's acceleration decided the race in a [...] "very few strides" [...] and he drew clear with [...] "ridiculous ease" [...] to win impressively by four lengths from Polemic (carrying 85 pounds) and Archiduc (117). His win was described by one correspondent as [...] "the greatest that has ever been accomplished within in the memory of racing men," [...] while others took the race as evidence for a radical reformation of the <b>weight-for-age</b> scale. Jack Hammond reportedly took £40,000 in winning bets on this occasion.|$|E
2500|$|Makybe Diva carried 58kg {{during the}} record third Melbourne Cup, 0.5kg above the <b>weight-for-age</b> scale for a mare in a 3200m race. The last horse to carry more than <b>weight-for-age</b> and win was Rain Lover, that was 1kg over {{when he won}} his second cup in 1969, with 60.5kg. Makybe Diva, that broke her own weight-carrying record for a mare of 55.5kg, which she set in 2004, was the highest-weighted winner of the Cup since Think Big won his second Melbourne Cup with 58.5kg in 1975. During the {{presentation}} of the Melbourne Cup, owner Tony Šantić announced that Makybe Diva would [...] "retire from racing as of today".|$|E
2500|$|On {{the opening}} day of the second October meeting, Miss Jummy ran in the £897 Clearwell Stakes. Carrying the top weight of 125 pounds, she started at odds of 100/15 in a field {{consisting}} of six colts and two fillies. Miss Jummy took the lead in the final quarter mile and held off a late challenge from Martinet to win [...] "cleverly" [...] by three quarters of a length. Three days later she reappeared in the Great Challenge Stakes, a <b>weight-for-age</b> race over six furlongs. She carried 97 pounds and Watts was replaced by a lightweight jockey. The filly became agitated before the start, and after being among the early leaders, she dropped back to finish fifth of the seven runners behind Modwena.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 October, Winx started {{favourite}} for Australia's {{most prestigious}} <b>weight-for-age</b> race, the Cox Plate over 2040 metres at Moonee Valley Racecourse. The field included an international element with Highland Reel (Secretariat Stakes) from Ireland, Arod (Diomed Stakes, Summer Mile Stakes) from England and Gailo Chop (Prix Guillaume d'Ornano) from France. The filly raced {{on the inside}} rail, broke clear of the field entering the straight and won by four and three quarter lengths from Criterion in a race record time of 2:02.98. After the race, her jockey Hugh Bowman said [...] "She's a group 1 mare, she's a serious racehorse. From the 800, I was very confident". Waller commented [...] "She is just such an athlete. I never thought {{when she was a}} young horse this was where she would get to".|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "Juniper filly" [...] had {{not been}} entered {{in any of the}} British Classic Races, which meant that she had limited {{opportunities}} to compete against the best horses of her generation {{in the early part of}} 1831. She made her seasonal debut at the Newmarket Craven meeting in April in a <b>weight-for-age</b> race over five furlongs. The filly was made 13/8 favourite in a field of nine runners and won from Guitar, a filly who went on to finish third to Oxygen in the Oaks Stakes. Before her next start, the Juniper filly was sold to Sir Mark Wood for £1,400 and was officially named Camarine. The filly was scheduled to run a match race against the three-year-old colt Zany at the Newmarket Second Spring meeting in May, but was withdrawn from the contest, with Wood paying a £79 forfeit.|$|E
2500|$|In June, Isonomy {{was sent}} to Royal Ascot where, {{on the first day}} of the meeting, he {{defeated}} the 1877 Epsom Derby winner Silvio (the 4/9 favourite) in the Gold Vase over two miles. Two days later, he competed in the Gold Cup, at that time regarded as the most important and prestigious <b>weight-for-age</b> race of the year. The field included two of the previous season's leading Classic performers: the French-trained Insulaire, who had won the Prix du Jockey Club and finished second in both The Derby and the Grand Prix; and Jannette, who had won The Oaks and defeated the colts, including Insulaire, in the St Leger. Isononomy was held up in the early stages before moving up to contest the lead as the field entered the straight. As Isonomy accelerated only Insulaire attempted to match him, and the two pulled well clear of the rest. In the closing stages Isonomy pulled away to beat the French colt easily by two lengths [...] "in a canter".|$|E
2500|$|Time Charter (6 April 1979 [...] 7 July 2005) was an Irish-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse and broodmare who won {{several major}} middle-distance races between 1982 and 1984. After winning twice as a two-year-old in 1981, she {{developed}} into a top-class racemare in the following year, finishing second in the 1000 Guineas before winning the classic Epsom Oaks in record time. Later that year she won the Sun Chariot Stakes before beating a field of colts and older horses by seven lengths in the Champion Stakes. As a four-year-old she won Britain's premier <b>weight-for-age</b> race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes and successfully conceded seven pounds to the outstanding French racemare All Along in the Prix Foy. In 1984 she recorded an impressive four length victory in the Coronation Cup and was retired from racing {{at the end of}} the year having won nine of her twenty races. She later became a very successful broodmare.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the opening}} day of the 1833 Newmarket season, Camarine started the 1/4 {{favourite}} for the Craven Stakes, a <b>weight-for-age</b> race over ten furlongs. The mare won [...] "in a canter" [...] by a length from Rubini, only for the race to be declared void by the judge who decided that a false start had caused two horses to be left behind. The race was re-run immediately and Camarine won again, beating Lady Charlotte and Fang, the two horses who had not competed in the original race, by a margin of six lengths. The race was likened to watching [...] "countrymen on foot running after a wild stag". At the First Spring meeting no horses appeared to challenge Camarine, who was allowed to walk over in a 100 guinea King's Plate and a £50 race over the Beacon Course. Camarine made her final appearance at the Second Spring meeting in May. Running over the Beacon Course, she won the Jockey Club Plate by eight lengths from her only opponent, Lord Tavistock's seven-year-old Taurus.|$|E
