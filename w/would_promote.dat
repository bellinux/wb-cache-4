5|$|New {{legislation}} {{stopped the}} TMB from investigating anonymous complaints concerning physicians {{as of the}} fall of 2011. The change was seen as a victory by physicians rights groups, who said that it <b>would</b> <b>promote</b> accountability in the investigations of physicians. Other groups worried that the new law would discourage the reporting of legitimate complaints against physicians. The board received 6,849 complaints in 2010; four percent of the complaints were submitted anonymously.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, {{following}} {{the cancellation of}} the live action series, the BBC approached the Canadian animation house Nelvana to propose an animated continuation of the show. The cartoon series was to feature an unspecified Doctor, incorporating elements of various BBC series Doctors. It {{was not to be}} oriented to a younger audience than the live action series; rather, it was intended to be a continuation of the cancelled series in animated form in order to save costs, with design elements that <b>would</b> <b>promote</b> merchandise sales.|$|E
5|$|NASA {{has named}} {{the rim of}} Shackleton as a {{potential}} candidate for its lunar outpost, slated to {{be up and running}} by 2020 and continuously staffed by a crew by 2024. The location <b>would</b> <b>promote</b> self-sustainability for lunar residents, as perpetual sunlight on the south pole would provide energy for solar panels. Furthermore, the shadowed polar regions are believed to contain the frozen water necessary for human consumption and could also be harvested for fuel manufacture.|$|E

50|$|Teams {{were divided}} in {{two groups of}} {{seventeen}} teams. The champions played a play-off for promotion. After that match, a mini-tournament was held to determine a second team that <b>would</b> be <b>promoted.</b> It turned out that group B runners-up BVV <b>would</b> be <b>promoted</b> and not group-B champions Haarlem.|$|R

5|$|The Song {{justice system}} was {{maintained}} by policing sheriffs, investigators, official coroners, and exam-drafted officials who became county magistrates. Song magistrates {{were encouraged to}} apply both their practical knowledge {{as well as the}} written law in making judicial decisions that <b>would</b> <b>promote</b> societal morality. Advancements in early forensic science, a greater emphasis on gathering credible evidence, and careful recording by clerks of autopsy reports and witness testimonies aided authorities in convicting criminals.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} of Matthias as king {{was the only}} way of avoiding a protracted civil war. Ladislaus Garai was the first baron to yield. At a meeting with Matthias's mother and uncle, he promised that he and his allies <b>would</b> <b>promote</b> Matthias's election, and Michael Szilágyi promised that his nephew would never seek vengeance for Ladislaus Hunyadi's execution. They also agreed that Matthias would marry the Palatine's daughter Annahis executed brother's bride.|$|E
5|$|With {{regard to}} hurricanes, it was {{hypothesized}} that by seeding the area around the eyewall with silver iodide, latent heat would be released. This <b>would</b> <b>promote</b> the formation of a new eyewall. As this new eyewall was larger than the old eyewall, the winds of the tropical cyclone would be weaker due to a reduced pressure gradient. Even a small reduction in the speed of a hurricane's winds would be beneficial: since the damage potential of a hurricane increased as the square of the wind speed, a slight lowering of wind speed would have a large reduction in destructiveness.|$|E
50|$|Black {{commissioned}} officers <b>would</b> be <b>promoted</b> by {{the same}} standards as their white counterparts.|$|R

50|$|The 2012-13 LEB Oro {{season was}} the 17th {{season of the}} Liga Española de Baloncesto, a Spanish {{basketball}} league. It was named Adecco Oro as its sponsored identity. The champion {{of the regular season}} <b>would</b> be <b>promoted</b> to Liga ACB. The teams between second and ninth position will play a best of five games play off, where the winner <b>would</b> be <b>promoted</b> too to the higher division.|$|R
5|$|A new U.S. federal {{government}} began operating in 1789, following the {{ratification of the}} United States Constitution. The previous central government under the Articles of Confederation {{had been unable to}} levy taxes; it had borrowed money to meet expenses and fund the Revolution, accumulating $54 million in debt. The state governments had amassed an additional $25 million in debt. Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton sought to use this debt to create a financial system that <b>would</b> <b>promote</b> American prosperity and national unity. In his Report on Public Credit, he urged Congress to consolidate the state and national debts into a single debt that would be funded by the {{federal government}}. Congress approved these measures in June and July 1790.|$|E
5|$|A strict {{conflict}} of interest policy was enacted, and researchers were {{forced to choose between}} the two entities; the initial investors had all kept their faculty jobs, and most returned to them. After the fledgling company's first contract resulted in a $4,000 loss, Robinson bought out {{all but one of the}} original investors and paid them each back their original $100. Robinson left EES and became president and CEO of the new company, which was renamed Scientific Atlanta. Boyd stayed on as a member of the board of directors; Robinson's friend Larry Clayton, previously involved in Robinson's radio business and now having graduated from Georgia Tech with a degree in physics, became the head of the new company's research and development. Years later, the school <b>would</b> <b>promote</b> Scientific Atlanta's origins at Georgia Tech, and Scientific Atlanta has been a longtime financial contributor to Georgia Tech.|$|E
5|$|After {{capturing}} Kaifeng, the Jurchens went on {{to conquer}} the rest of northern China, while the Song Chinese court fled south. They took up temporary residence at Nanjing, where a surviving prince was named Emperor Gaozong of Song in 1127. Jin forces halted at the Yangzi River, but staged continual raids south of the river until a later boundary was fixed at the Huai River further north. With the border fixed at the Huai, the Song government <b>would</b> <b>promote</b> an immigration policy of repopulating and resettling territories north of the Yangzi River, since vast tracts of vacant land between the Yangzi and Huai were open for landless peasants found in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian provinces of the south.|$|E

5|$|Andrew was the {{favorite}} nephew of Stephen Báthory who officially adopted him. Giovanni Andrea Caligari, the papal nuncio (or ambassador) in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, urged the king to persuade Andrew {{to start a}} church career. According to the Transylvanian historian, István Szamosközy, Andrew had already been fascinated by altars, churches and tombs as a child. However, his Protestant mother and relatives wanted to dissuade Andrew. After recovering from an almost lethal pneumonia in spring 1581, Andrew accepted their advice. He was especially worried about clerical celibacy, because it prevented him from fathering legitimate children. He also hoped that his uncle <b>would</b> <b>promote</b> his secular career. His Jesuit tutors finally persuaded him to accept his uncle's decision.|$|E
5|$|During the war, {{the musical}} life of Britain was {{drastically}} curtailed. The LSO was helped to survive by large donations from Sir Thomas Beecham, who also subsidised the Hallé and the Royal Philharmonic Society. For a year {{he took the}} role, though not the title, of chief conductor of the LSO. In 1916 his millionaire father died and Beecham's financial affairs became too complicated for any further musical philanthropy on his part. In 1917 the LSO's directors agreed unanimously that they <b>would</b> <b>promote</b> no more concerts {{until the end of}} the war. The orchestra played for other managements, and managed to survive, although the hitherto remunerative work for regional choral societies dwindled to almost nothing.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, the Senators {{would sign}} Daigle to a $12.25 million contract, the largest rookie salary in League history, which {{would lead to}} a cap on rookie {{contracts}} a few years later. The club <b>would</b> <b>promote</b> Daigle over Alexei Yashin, nominating Daigle for rookie of the year over Yashin. His play did not justify full-time status and in 1995, coaches Rick Bowness and Alain Vigneault demoted Daigle to part-time status. The move led to Bowness and Vigneault being fired. In the end, Daigle did not come close to the career the Senators hoped for. After scoring only 74 goals in just over four seasons, he was traded to the Philadelphia Flyers, and is widely {{regarded as one of the}} biggest draft busts in sports history.|$|E

5|$|Since {{as early}} as 1967, local {{officials}} have discussed building a Manchester bypass, either as a separate project {{or as part of}} a road bypassing both Hampstead and Manchester. However, by the mid-1970s, the town of Manchester decided it did not want the bypass. The bypass was planned to pass to the west of Manchester, but the town allowed a residential subdivision to be built along the bypass route. The planned bypass route was eventually changed to be east of town. After two decades of disagreement by the town and county over the path of the bypass, in 1993 the bypass was placed in the town's master plan. However, state support for the Manchester bypass was scrapped in 1998 by Smart Growth proponent and governor Parris Glendening, who said the bypass <b>would</b> <b>promote</b> suburban sprawl. The Manchester Bypass is neither in the Maryland Department of Transportation's Consolidated Transportation Program for 2012 to 2017 nor in MDSHA's 2011 Highway Needs Inventory for the next 20 years.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine Emperor, John V Palaiologos visited Louis in Buda {{in early}} 1366, seeking his {{assistance}} against the Ottoman Turks , who had {{set foot in}} Europe. This was the first occasion that a Byzantine Emperor left his empire to plead for a foreign monarch's assistance. According to Louis's physician, Giovanni di Conversino, at {{his first meeting with}} Louis, the emperor refused to dismount and to take off his hat, which offended Louis. John V pledged that he <b>would</b> <b>promote</b> the union of the Byzantine Church with the Papacy, and Louis promised to send him help, but neither the emperor nor Louis fulfilled their promises. Pope Urban encouraged Louis not to send help to Constantinople before the emperor guaranteed the Church union.|$|E
5|$|The Democrats {{held their}} {{convention}} in Chicago {{the following month}} and nominated Governor Grover Cleveland of New York. Cleveland’s time {{on the national scene}} was brief, but Democrats hoped that his reputation as a reformer and an opponent of corruption would attract Republicans dissatisfied with Blaine and his reputation for scandal. They were correct, as reform-minded Republicans (called “Mugwumps”) denounced Blaine as corrupt and flocked to Cleveland. The Mugwumps, including such men as Carl Schurz and Henry Ward Beecher, were more concerned with morality than with party, and felt Cleveland was a kindred soul who <b>would</b> <b>promote</b> civil service reform and fight for efficiency in government. However, even as the Democrats gained support from the Mugwumps, they lost some blue-collar workers to the Greenback Party, led by Benjamin F. Butler, Blaine’s antagonist from their early days in the House.|$|E

5|$|There was broad {{agreement}} between Taft and Knox on major foreign policy goals; the U.S. would not interfere in European affairs, and would use force {{if necessary to}} enforce the Monroe Doctrine in the Americas. The defense of the Panama Canal, which was under construction throughout Taft's term (it opened in 1914), guided United States {{foreign policy in the}} Caribbean and Central America. Previous administrations had made efforts to promote American business interests overseas, but Taft went a step further and used the web of American diplomats and consuls abroad to further trade. Such ties, Taft hoped, <b>would</b> <b>promote</b> world peace. Taft pushed for arbitration treaties with Great Britain and France, but the Senate was not willing to yield its constitutional prerogative to approve treaties to arbitrators.|$|E
5|$|Compared to the flourishing {{of science}} and {{technology}} in the Song dynasty, the Ming dynasty perhaps saw fewer advancements in science and technology compared to the pace of discovery in the Western world. In fact, key advances in Chinese science in the late Ming were spurred by contact with Europe. In 1626 Johann Adam Schall von Bell wrote the first Chinese treatise on the telescope, the Yuanjingshuo (Far Seeing Optic Glass); in 1634 the Chongzhen Emperor acquired the telescope of the late Johann Schreck (1576–1630). The heliocentric model of the solar system was rejected by the Catholic missionaries in China, but Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei's ideas slowly trickled into China starting with the Polish Jesuit Michael Boym (1612–59) in 1627, Adam Schall von Bell's treatise in 1640, and finally Joseph Edkins, Alex Wylie, and John Fryer in the 19th century. Catholic Jesuits in China <b>would</b> <b>promote</b> Copernican theory at court, {{yet at the same time}} embrace the Ptolemaic system in their writing; it was not until 1865 that Catholic missionaries in China sponsored the heliocentric model as their Protestant peers did. Although Shen Kuo (1031–95) and Guo Shoujing (1231–1316) had laid the basis for trigonometry in China, another important work in Chinese trigonometry would not be published again until 1607 with the efforts of Xu Guangqi and Matteo Ricci. Ironically, some inventions which had their origins in ancient China were reintroduced to China from Europe during the late Ming; for example, the field mill.|$|E
