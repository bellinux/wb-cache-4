Mark Blankenship from NPR found [...] "I Won't Give Up" [...] the best lyric video because [...] "the lyrics are {{integrated}} into {{a story about a}} man who writes his girlfriend until they can finally reunite." [...] He added he preferred this video to the official one. The official music video was directed by Mark Pellington and released on February 17, 2012. Mraz explained [...] "The story of the video is that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>our</b> stories. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>our</b> own version of suffering….and everybody has many things to not give up on." ...|$|E

To me, that's the nature of friendship: How we grow, how we grow up, and how things change. These boys knew each other when they were 16 and now they're 35 and they have to find a new truth. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>our</b> own {{relationships}} like that, whether they're matrimonial relationships or friendships.|$|E

2500|$|However, Jarrett was not {{guaranteed}} {{to start the}} first five races using the champion's provisional as he had the year before as Kurt Busch, the 2004 champion, had his team's owner points transferred to his teammate Sam Hornish, Jr. and would be first to receive it. Jarrett started off 2008 with a 16th-place finish at Daytona. He retired from points racing after the Food City 500 at Bristol Motor Speedway. At the weekend's pre-race driver's meeting, {{he spoke to the}} other drivers, saying [...] "Enjoy this. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>our</b> time in this, and mine has been fantastic. To me, it has been an honor and a privilege to be able to race in this series and say I raced with and against and sometimes beat the best in the world. Thanks for allowing me to do that. Enjoy it. It's a great sport, and you guys make it what it is." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ray is head chef at The Queen Victoria, is in a {{relationship}} with Kat's friend Kim Fox (Tameka Empson) and is trusted by Alfie, of which Inside Soap said an affair [...] "seems unimaginable, but might he surprise us with his actions?" [...] They called Ray [...] "eye candy" [...] for Kat, saying [...] "it's never a bad thing" [...] for her, and noted that she appreciates him as her head chef. For Kat to have an affair with Ray would not only mean betraying Alfie but also Kim. They felt that Ray was the most obvious choice, and had not yet had a major storyline, and an affair would shock viewers and have a big impact on Ray's family life. They also said that they would not blame Kat for an affair with Ray as he is [...] "gorgeous, sensitive and has a six-pack to die for". Soaplife opined that Ray was the [...] "red herring", as actor Venn has said he would like Ray to marry Kim and start a family, and later said that all hints were pointing to Ray, so [...] "it would be no kind of mystery if it is him." [...] All About Soap said that Ray's [...] "flirty banter with Kat has sent her into a spin", but were not sure Ray would be the one having the affair, especially after Kat picks Alfie for the football team over Ray, and made him joint third most likely, along with Derek. The magazine later opined that [...] "lovely" [...] Ray would not have it in him to cheat, but thought he may have tired of Kim's behaviour. Empson told Inside Soap that she was unsure if Kat would cheat on Ray as Kim is her best friend, while Venn said that [...] "Kat's a saucy minx, and what man wouldn't want to get involved with her? Ray is a loyal, caring father, but <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>have</b> <b>our</b> dark sides. There's a lot the audience hasn't seen yet, put it that way..." [...] Venn also said, [...] "I would love it to be me—for the drama, of course. Why not? You can just imagine the kind of drama which would ensue with Kim. It'd be fight of the century, that one. Dynasty would have nothing on this!" [...] Venn also {{said in an interview that}} he was looking forward to kissing scenes with Wallace, implying that Ray could be Kat's lover. Ray was the first of the five suspects to be eliminated, on 7 August 2012.|$|E

60|$|I was {{surprised}} at the contempt, tolerant and yet profound, with which these three men in the dining-room spoke of the others in the stanza. How contemptuous, almost bitter, the driver was against alcohol. It was evident he hated it. And though <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> <b>our</b> bottles of dead-cold dark wine, and though <b>we</b> <b>all</b> drank: still, the feeling of the three youths against actual intoxication was deep and hostile, with a certain burning moral dislike that is more northern than Italian. And they curled their lip with real dislike of the girovago: his forwardness, his impudent aggressiveness.|$|R

60|$|Fascination {{wished to}} know if the colour were not called rose-colour? Yes, said Mr Lammle; {{actually}} he knew everything; it was really rose-colour. Fascination took rose-colour to mean the colour of roses. (In this he was very warmly supported by Mr and Mrs Lammle.) Fascination had heard the term Queen of Flowers applied to the Rose. Similarly, it might be said that the dress was the Queen of Dresses. ('Very happy, Fledgeby!' from Mr Lammle.) Notwithstanding, Fascination's opinion was that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>had</b> <b>our</b> eyes--or at least a large majority of us--and that--and--and his farther opinion was several ands, with nothing beyond them.|$|R
