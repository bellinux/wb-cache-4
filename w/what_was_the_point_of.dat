At this time his {{identity}} was unknown, but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues, which {{made a point}} of his secret identity. According to both Stan Lee and John Romita, Sr., who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, Lee always wanted the Green Goblin to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted his civilian identity to be someone who hadn't yet been introduced. Lee elaborated: [...] "Steve wanted him to turn out to be just some character that we had never seen before. Because, he said, in real life, very often a villain turns out to be somebody that you never knew. And I felt that that would be wrong. I felt, in a sense, it would be like cheating the reader. ... if it's somebody you didn't know and had never seen, then <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> following all the clues? I think that frustrates the reader." [...] However, Lee prefaced this statement by admitting that, due to his self-professed poor memory, he may have been confusing the Green Goblin with a different character, and in an earlier essay he had said that he could not remember whether Norman Osborn being the Green Goblin was his idea or Ditko's. Ditko has maintained that it was his idea, even claiming that he had decided on it before the first Green Goblin story was finished, and that a character he drew in the background of a single panel of Amazing Spider-Man #23 was meant to be Norman Osborn (who is not introduced until issue #37).|$|E

5000|$|Increasingly Whiteside took up issues {{concerning}} {{the strength of}} the Royal Air Force. In 1933 he argued that it was so inadequate to Britain's defence that it was inviting attack. During the debate on the 1934 Air Estimates, Whiteside spoke of Stanley Baldwin's remark the previous year that [...] "the bomber will always get through" [...] and rhetorically asked <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> such a large expenditure on the RAF if it could not defend Britain. He implicitly disagreed with Baldwin, calling attention to the RAF's success in preventing the Gotha bombers breaking through after May 1918. In April 1934 he took up the matter with Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, pressing for the RAF to be built up to parity with other countries. He also suggested that six aircraft carriers would be sufficient to protect the Royal Navy against air attack throughout the world.|$|E

Various ideas were tried in order to re-create the town in the image of the party, but nothing worked. In 1973, out of total frustration, Sar decided that the only solution was to send the entire population of the town to the fields in the countryside. He wrote at the time [...] "if the result of so many sacrifices was that the capitalists remain in control, <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> the revolution?".

40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis {{is the history of}} the library at The Göteborg Museum of Art. The aim of the thesis is to depict and analyze the {{emergence}} and the expansion of the library’s holdings until 1939. To fulfill the aim, two questions are asked. The first question is: Is it possible to argue that the library’s holdings were collected to document the entire world of art? The question is formulated in relation to a comment by Susan Wyngaard. According to Wyngaard, art libraries tries to document the entire world of art. The second question is: <b>What</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> having a library at The Göteborg Museum of Art and did the library’s holdings support the museum’s educating, aesthetic or ritual function? The question is inspired by some remarks in Carol Duncan’s book Civilizing rituals: Inside public art museums. The source material which is examined to answer the two questions consists mainly of the annual reports that the museum curator Axel Romdahl published in Göteborgs museum’s yearbook and also of two library ledgers found in The Göteborg Museum of Art. The results of the thesis are based on my observations and interpretations of the data in the annual reports and in the library ledgers. Michael Baxandall’s remark that historical objects can be explained by being treated as solutions to problems in situtations has assisted the analysis of the source material. Three conclusions are drawn in the thesis. The first conclusion is drawn in relation to Michael Baxandall’s remark that historical objects can be explained by being treated as solutions to problems in situations. The conclusion is that the visual documents that were collected in the library helped to expand the opportunities to see art at The Göteborg Museum of Art. The textual documents that were collected in the library helped solving another problem, which dealt with gathering written knowledge of art. The second conclusion is that a few specialized areas were particularly prominent during certain periods of time. In the 1910 ’s and in the 1920 ’s, the library’s holdings were focused on reproductions of graphic art and drawings made by artists from the european continent. During a few years {{in the beginning of the}} 1930 ’s, a large number of monographs on Swedish artists were aquired. The conclusion shows that it is not completely safe to argue that art libraries tries to document the entire world of art. The third conclusion is that the library at The Göteborg Museum of Art supported the museum’s educating function, and that the library at least had the potential to support the museum’s aesthetic and ritual function.
