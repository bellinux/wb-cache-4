This method relies on the Video capture card and the type of camera, not flexible and universal and (2) the use of Microsoft’s Windows operating system and VFW (Video For <b>Window)</b> <b>software</b> Development Kit of Visual C++. It is a pure software way to realize the collection of video streaming, input, and output. This method does not depend on the type of vision sensors, with better flexibility and versatility [20, 21].|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a study of}} Java program debugging using a multiple <b>window</b> <b>software</b> debugging environment (SDE). In this study we have replicated an earlier study by Romero et al. (2002 a, 2002 b, 2003), but with the difference of using both the Restricted Focus Viewer and the eye tracking equipment to track the visual attention of the subjects. The study involved ten subjects debugging short Java programs using the SDE. The SDE included three different representations of the Java programs, those of the program source code, a visualization of the program, and its output concurrently in three separate panels in SDE. We used the Restricted Focus Viewer (RFV) and a remote eye tracker to collect the visual attention of the subjects. A with-in subject design, similar to Romero et al., employing both RFV/no-RVF task conditions was used. The overall results of the time distributions over three different representations of the programs agree with the study of Romero et al. But the results of visual attention switching raise some questions {{to be considered in}} later studies...|$|E
40|$|Transparent spectrally {{selective}} coatings {{on glass}} or polymeric substrates have been recently proposed to optimize daylighting and energy performances of glazing systems. Although a wide choice {{of these materials}} is available, the experimental and numerical characterization of their properties is still not complete. Optical measurements on several single and double sheet glazings with different solar-control coatings {{have been carried out}} with a spectrophotometer. The aim is to define optimal combinations of glazings and coatings to realize energy efficient multi-sheet systems. Transmittance and reflectance measurements have been carried out referring to different angles of incidence of daylight. The paper presents the first experimental results and a discussion on the influence of various parameters (such as glazing thickness, kind of coating, angle of incidence) on the energy performances of glazing systems. A comparison has been carried out using experimental data to build multisheet glazings and data extracted from <b>WINDOW</b> <b>software.</b> Simulations were performed with the hourly simulation program IENUS. The program was developed to assess the building energy demand with different kinds of climatic data and of daylighting...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{nutritional}} status of vegetarian and non vegetarian boys studying in Sainik school (based on z-scores). Methods: The {{present study was}} based on anthropometric data of 342 boys age group between 13 to 18 years collected at Sainik School, Bijapur. Three anthropometric indices were adopted for assessing the nutritional status of children. viz. weight-for-age, height-for-age and BMI for age. The data were analysed statistically, using SPSS <b>Window</b> <b>software.</b> Result: A total of 12. 40 % vegetarian and 11. 40 % non vegetarian boys were classified under moderate stunting z-score values for height for age. Around 5. 70 % vegetarian and 3. 40 % non vegetarian were underweight with a z-score value of moderate weight-for-age. Differences observed were higher body weight of non vegetarian boys as compared to vegetarian boys. The values of fat%, fat mass and mid upper arm circumference were significantly higher among non vegetarians as compared to vegetarians (p< 0. 05). Conclusion: There were {{no significant difference between}} vegetarian and non vegetarian boys in terms of BMI-for-age, weight-for-age and height-for-age. However, sigificant differences were observed for moderate z-score value of weight for age and height for age among non vegetarian and vegetarian boys. 5. 7 % vegetarian and 3. 4 % non vegetarian boys showed a moderate z-score value of weight-for-age indicating underweight and 12. 4 % vegetarian and 11. 4 % non vegetarian boys showed a moderate z-score value of height-for-age indicative of stunting. More than 85 % of both vegetarian and non vegetarian boys/cadets were growing up normally and quite healthy...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this study was {{comparative}} evaluation of sagittal condylar values of arcon and non-arcon articulators with cephalometric readings and to determine the amount of discrepancy in sagittal condylar guidance values between arcon and non-arcon articulators using same protrusive record. Materials and Methods: Twenty subjects in the age group of 19 - 35 years, free from temporomandibular joint dysfunction, and occlusal disharmony, with healthy dentition participated in the study. Hanau H 2 (non-arcon type) and Hanau Wide-Vue (arcon type) articulators were programmed for sagittal condylar guidance values using the same protrusive record made in polysiloxane bite registration material with edge to edge degree of protrusion. The resultant values for both the articulators on either side were compared with values obtained from tracing of digital lateral cephalogram using Kodak Dental imaging <b>Window</b> <b>software</b> 6. 6. 3. 0 -C program. The tabulated data were subjected to statistical analysis, ANOVA (Fishers ′F′ test) for group comparison, Tukey′s HSD test for inter-comparison, student′s unpaired ′t′ test for intra-group comparison, and level of significance (P) was calculated using the same. Results: The mean sagittal condylar guidance values of the three different groups were found to be very highly significant (P= 0. 001) and highly significant (P= 0. 002) on the right and left sides respectively. There was a very highly significant difference (P= 0. 001) and highly significant difference (P= 0. 003) between the arcon and non-arcon group on the right and left side respectively. No significant difference was found between the arcon and cephalometric group (P= 0. 284 right, P= 0. 853 left) and a statistically significant difference was found between the non-arcon and cephalometric group (P= 0. 049 right, P= 0. 015 left). On intragroup comparison there was no statistically significant difference in sagittal condylar values on the right and left sides. Conclusion: The mean difference in the sagittal condylar guidance values obtained from non-arcon and arcon articulators shows a low level of reproducibility, and no significant difference found in mean sagittal condylar values obtained from arcon articulator and cephalometric tracings indicates replication of sagittal condylar guidance value from image of articular eminence...|$|E

40|$|THERM is a state-of-the-art, Microsoft Windows{trademark}-based {{computer}} program developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) {{for use by}} building component manufacturers, engineers, educators, students, architects, and others interested in heat transfer. Using THERM, you can model two-dimensional heat-transfer effects in building components such as windows, walls, foundations, roofs, and doors; appliances; and other products where thermal bridges are of concern. THERM's heat-transfer analysis allows you to evaluate a product's energy efficiency and local temperature patterns, which may relate directly to problems with condensation, moisture damage, and structural integrity. THERM's two-dimensional conduction heat-transfer analysis {{is based on the}} finite-element method, which can model the complicated geometries of building products. The program's graphic interface allows you to draw cross sections of products or components to be analyzed. To create the cross sections, you can trace imported files in DXF or bitmap format, or input the geometry from known dimensions. Each cross section is represented by a combination of polygons. You define the material properties for each polygon and introduce the environmental conditions to which the component is exposed by defining the boundary conditions surrounding the cross section. Once the model is created, the remaining analysis (mesher and heat transfer) is automatic. You can view results from THERM in several forms, including U-factors, isotherms, heat-flux vectors, and local temperatures. This version of THERM includes several new technical and user interface features; the most significant is a radiation view-factor algorithm. This feature increases the accuracy of calculations in situations where you are analyzing non-planar surfaces that have different temperatures and exchange energy through radiation heat transfer. This heat-transfer mechanism is important in greenhouse windows, hollow cavities, and some aluminum frames. THERM is a module of the WINDOW+ 5 program under development by LBNL. WINDOW+ 5 is the next generation of the <b>WINDOW</b> <b>software</b> series and is being developed for the Microsoft Windows{trademark} operating environment. THERM's results can be used with WINDOW's center-of-glass optical and thermal models to determine total window product U-factors and Solar Heat Gain Coefficients. These values can be used, in turn, with the RESFEN program, which calculates total annual energy requirements in typical residences throughout the United States...|$|E
