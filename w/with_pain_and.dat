5|$|The 1130 Pipe Roll {{noted that}} Pain was a royal justice in Staffordshire, Gloucestershire, and Pembroke. Besides the {{ordinary}} court, Pain also heard cases {{relating to the}} forest law in those counties. The Pipe Roll does not record Pain as sheriff in Shropshire, but this is likely because the Shropshire returns for that year are missing from it. Also in 1130, Pain was consulted by the king about the appointment to a vacant bishopric. The Diocese of Hereford had been vacant {{since the death of}} Richard de Capella in August 1127, and the king consulted <b>with</b> <b>Pain</b> <b>and</b> the constable of Hereford before accepting their candidate—Robert de Bethune, the prior of Llanthony Priory. In 1132 Pain was present, along with his brother, at the Christmas court held by King Henry. Subsequently Caus Castle, which was under Pain's control, was burnt by the Welsh in 1134. As lord of Caus, Pain was involved in efforts to suppress Welsh raiding. Although Pain held Caus, his title to the fortification was unclear, as it had earlier been held by Robert Corbet.|$|E

Depressed mood was also improved but this could not be distinguished from some risks of bias.|$|E

In less severe cases, patients may have only poor recollection of conversations, events, pain, pressure, or {{difficulty in breathing}}. Some cases of difficulty in breathing are caused by intubation errors and/or problems with the ventilator and a patient might be suffocating.|$|E

25|$|Laser {{therapy is}} the use of high-intensity light to destroy tumor cells while {{affecting}} only the treated area. This is typically done if the cancer cannot be removed by surgery. The relief of a blockage can help <b>with</b> <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> difficulty swallowing. Photodynamic therapy, a type of laser therapy, involves the use of drugs that are absorbed by cancer cells; when exposed to a special light, the drugs become active and destroy the cancer cells.|$|E

25|$|Treatment is {{typically}} not needed {{if there are}} no symptoms. NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, may help <b>with</b> <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> bleeding while paracetamol (acetaminophen) may help with pain. Iron supplements may be needed in those with heavy periods. Medications of the gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist class may decrease the size of the fibroids but are expensive and associated with side effects. If greater symptoms are present, surgery to remove the fibroid or uterus may help. Uterine artery embolization may also help. Cancerous versions of fibroids are very rare and are known as leiomyosarcomas. They do not appear to develop from benign fibroids.|$|E
25|$|Tramadol has {{inhibitory}} {{actions on}} the 5-HT2C receptor. Antagonism of 5-HT2C could be partially responsible for tramadol's reducing effect on depressive and obsessive–compulsive symptoms in patients <b>with</b> <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> co-morbid neurological illnesses. 5-HT2C blockade may also account for its lowering of the seizure threshold, as 5-HT2C knockout mice display significantly increased vulnerability to epileptic seizures, sometimes resulting in spontaneous death. However, the reduction of seizure threshold {{could be attributed to}} tramadol's putative inhibition of GABAA receptors at high doses (significant inhibition at 100μM). In addition, desmetramadol is a high-affinity ligand of the DOR, and activation of this receptor could be involved in tramadol's ability to provoke seizures in some individuals, as DOR agonists are well-known for inducing seizures.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{randomized}} {{study in}} medical literature that {{has studied the}} response with amputation of patients who have failed the above-mentioned therapies and who continue to be miserable. Nonetheless, {{there are reports that}} on average cite about half of the patients will have resolution of their pain, while half will develop phantom limb pain and/or pain at the amputation site. It is likely that as in any other chronic pain syndrome, the brain becomes chronically stimulated <b>with</b> <b>pain,</b> <b>and</b> late amputation may not work as well as it might be expected. In a survey of fifteen patients with CRPS Type 1, eleven responded that their life was better after amputation. Since this is the ultimate treatment of a painful extremity, it should be left as a last resort.|$|E

25|$|Superman is most {{vulnerable}} to green Kryptonite, mineral debris from Krypton transformed into radioactive material by the forces that destroyed the planet. Exposure to green Kryptonite radiation nullifies Superman's powers and immobilizes him <b>with</b> <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> nausea; prolonged exposure will eventually kill him. The only substance on Earth that can protect him from Kryptonite is lead, which blocks the radiation. Lead is also the only known substance that Superman cannot see through with his x-ray vision. Kryptonite was introduced in 1943 as a plot device to allow the radio-serial voice actor, Bud Collyer, {{to take some time}} off. Although green Kryptonite is the most commonly seen form, writers have introduced other forms over the years: such as red, gold, blue, white, and black, each with its own effect.|$|E
25|$|After {{some time}} of peace, Glaurung returns to exterminate {{the men of}} Brethil. Turambar leads an {{expedition}} to cut him off, and stabs Glaurung from beneath while the dragon is crossing a ravine. As Glaurung is dying {{on the bank of}} the ravine, Turambar pulls his sword from the dragon's belly, and blood spurts onto his hand and burns him. Overwhelmed <b>with</b> <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> fatigue, he faints. Niënor finds him and mistakes his swoon for death. In a last effort of malice Glaurung opens his eyes and informs her that she and Turambar are brother and sister. Glaurung then dies, and his spell of forgetfulness passes from Niënor. Remembering her entire life and knowing that her unborn child was begotten in incest, she throws herself from the nearby cliff into the river Taeglin and is washed away. When Turambar wakes, Brandir informs him of Niënor's death and of their true relationship as siblings, as he had overheard the dragon's words. Mablung confirms Brandir's tale, and Turambar takes his own life upon his sword.|$|E
25|$|In interviews, Zevon {{described}} a lifelong phobia {{of doctors and}} said he seldom received medical assessment. Shortly before playing at the Edmonton Folk Music Festival in 2002, he started feeling dizzy and developed a chronic cough. After a period of suffering <b>with</b> <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> shortness of breath, Zevon was encouraged by his dentist to see a physician; {{he was diagnosed with}} pleural mesothelioma, a cancer that affects the pleura, a thin membrane around the lungs and chest lining. Although Zevon never revealed where he may have been exposed to asbestos, his son, Jordan, suggests that it came from Zevon's childhood, playing in the attic of his father's carpet store in Arizona. Refusing treatments he believed might incapacitate him, Zevon instead began recording his final album, The Wind, which includes performances by close friends including Bruce Springsteen, Don Henley, Jackson Browne, Timothy B. Schmit, Joe Walsh, David Lindley, Billy Bob Thornton, Emmylou Harris, Tom Petty, Dwight Yoakam, and others. At the request of the music television channel VH1, the documentarian Nick Read was given access to the sessions; his cameras recorded a man who retained his mordant sense of humor, even as his health was deteriorating.|$|E

They are {{followed}} by Ippolit, who informs the Prince that he and others (such as Lebedyev and Ganya) have been intriguing against him, and have been unsettling Aglaya with talk of Nastassya Filippovna. Ippolit has arranged, at Aglaya'a request and with Rogozhin's help, a meeting between the two women. That evening Aglaya, having left her home in secret, calls for the Prince. They proceed in silence to the appointed meeting place, where Nastassya Filippovna waits for Aglaya to begin. It soon becomes apparent that Aglaya has not come there to discuss anything, but to chastise and humiliate Nastassya Filippovna. Nastassya Filippovna responds in kind and a bitter exchange of accusations and insults ensues. Nastassya Filippovna orders Rogozhin to leave and hysterically demands of Myshkin that he stay with her. Myshkin, once again torn by her suffering, is unable to deny her and reproaches Aglaya for her attack. Aglaya looks at him <b>with</b> <b>pain</b> <b>and</b> hatred, and runs off. He goes after her but Nastassya Filippovna stops him desperately and then faints. Myshkin stays with her.|$|E
