5|$|Pearlman's and Steve Schenk's {{managerial}} {{efforts were}} rewarded when Blue Öyster Cult were hired for some gigs in Greece in July 1987. After a nine-month layoff, the band returned to activity and Allen Lanier re-joined. The European shows were a success, and the reformed line-up of Bloom, Roeser, Lanier, Jon Rogers and drummer Ron Riddle worked very <b>well</b> <b>together</b> on stage. Blue Öyster Cult {{returned to the}} road in 1987 and 1988 with renewed enthusiasm, but without a new album to promote, until the release of Imaginos.|$|E
5|$|The Epistles are {{admired for}} the way that their poetry and music fit so <b>well</b> <b>together.</b> Bellman chose not to compose the tunes, instead {{borrowing}} and adapting existing melodies, most likely to exploit the humour of contrasting the associations of well-known tunes with the meanings he gave them. This {{may also have been}} intended to provide historical depth to his work; he sometimes devoted considerable energy to adapting melodies to fit an Epistle's needs.|$|E
5|$|As Stanton and Ranft {{discussed}} the adaptation, they rattled off scenarios and storylines springing from their premise. Lasseter {{liked the idea}} and offered some suggestions. The concept simmered until early-1995, when the story team began work on the second film in earnest. During an early test screening for Toy Story in San Rafael in June 1995, they pitched the film to Disney CEO Michael Eisner. Eisner thought the idea was fine and they submitted a treatment to Disney in early-July under the title Bugs. Disney approved the treatment and gave notice on July 7 that it was exercising the option of a second film under the original 1991 agreement between Disney and Pixar. Lasseter assigned the co-director job to Stanton; both worked <b>well</b> <b>together</b> and had similar sensibilities. Lasseter had realized that working on a computer-animated feature as a sole-director was dangerous while the production of Toy Story was in process. In addition, Lasseter believed that it would relieve stress and that the role would groom Stanton for having his own position as a lead director.|$|E

5|$|Carmella's {{relationship}} with Connor was originally scripted for Nina Tucker, but {{was transferred to}} Carmella by the producers on Goodrem's departure. Upon Carmella's introduction, her only family member was her mobster father Rocco, who {{had been sent to}} prison. In 2006, Carmella was given a sister, when Natalie Saleeba was cast in the role of Rosetta Cammeniti. Blair opined that Rosie's inclusion brought out different sides to Carmella's character. Many viewers told Blair they felt the casting was good because they look alike. One of the significant changes to Carmella was that she started having fun again—Blair felt this meant they worked <b>well</b> <b>together.</b> Later, Erin McNaught was cast as her cousin Sienna Cammeniti. McNaught commented {{that there had been a}} rivalry between the cousins in their youth, so it would be interesting to see what unfolded between them.|$|E
5|$|In 1673, the Duke of York's {{conversion}} to Catholicism became public, and {{he married a}} Catholic princess, Mary of Modena, who was only {{six and a half}} years older than Anne. Charles II had no legitimate children, and so the Duke of York was next in the line of succession, followed by his two surviving daughters from his first marriage, Mary and Anne—as long as he had no son. Over the next ten years, the new Duchess of York had ten children, but all were either stillborn or died in infancy, leaving Mary and Anne second and third in the line of succession after their father. There is every indication that, throughout Anne's early life, she and her stepmother got on <b>well</b> <b>together,</b> and the Duke of York was a conscientious and loving father.|$|E
5|$|Love Kraft is {{the seventh}} studio album by Welsh indie rock band Super Furry Animals, {{released}} on 22 August 2005 through Epic Records in the United Kingdom. The album {{was recorded in}} Spain with producer Mario Caldato Jr and {{was something of a}} departure for the band, with all members contributing songs and lead vocals alongside Gruff Rhys who had been main songwriter for the Super Furries until this point. In selecting tracks for Love Kraft a conscious effort was made by the band not to choose songs on their individual merit but rather to pick those which went <b>well</b> <b>together</b> in order to create as cohesive an album as possible. The album's name was taken from a sex shop, Love Craft, near the Cardiff offices of the Super Furries' management team and is also a nod to American horror writer H. P. Lovecraft.|$|E

5|$|The five-man chase {{group did}} not work <b>well</b> <b>together,</b> with only Greipel and Wellens {{consistently}} working {{at the front of}} the group. Kelderman put in a brief surge on the final climb of the Windraak to reduce van Baarle and Le Bon's lead, but the group was not able to bring the leading pair back. Van Baarle and Le Bon worked together until the final , when Le Bon attacked in the slipstream of one of the motorbikes following the race. Van Baarle continued chasing but, with both riders exhausted from their efforts through the day, he was unable properly to regain contact. Le Bon was able to hold on in the sprint to take the stage victory, with Van Baarle finishing second on the same time. Cort won the sprint for third, with Wellens and Kelderman on the same time. Kelderman took over the race lead, one second ahead of Le Bon, with Van Emden dropping to fourth.|$|E
5|$|At the Tehran Conference in November 1943, President Roosevelt named Eisenhower as the Supreme Allied Commander for Overlord. Devers {{hoped that}} he would be {{appointed}} commander of the First Army Group, but instead was sent to the Mediterranean as Commander North African Theater of Operations, United States Army (NATOUSA), primarily a logistical administrative organization. American formations in the theater included Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark's Fifth Army and George Patton's Seventh Army; the Twelfth Air Force, led by Major General John K. Cannon; the Fifteenth Air Force, commanded by Major General Nathan Twining; and the NATOUSA Services of Supply headed by Lieutenant General Thomas B. Larkin. Eaker went with Devers as Commander in Chief of the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces. Devers, who arrived at Allied Force Headquarters (AFHQ) in Algiers on 4 January 1944, was also deputy to the Supreme Allied Commander, Mediterranean Theater, British General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson. Devers and Wilson worked <b>well</b> <b>together,</b> and despite the administrative nature of his position, Devers {{spent most of his time}} at the front. Wilson often had Devers deal with difficult cases like the French and the Poles, and Devers was later decorated by the Polish government in exile for allowing Poles captured in German uniform to join the Polish II Corps in Italy.|$|E
5|$|Concepts {{for a third}} {{installment}} in the Parasite Eve {{video game}} series had been around for some time. As work was being finished on , Nomura voiced his wish {{to create a new}} game for the character Aya Brea, and this time it was taken up. Despite the story of Parasite Eve II not leaving many avenues for a sequel, the development team wanted to take advantage of advancing gaming technology and popularity by creating a mature gaming experience that would re-introduce Aya to players around the world. The main staff consisted of director Hajime Tabata, producer Yoshinori Kitase, creative producer and character designer Tetsuya Nomura, art director Isamu Kamikokuryo, scenario director Motomu Toriyama, and main writer Toshimitsu Takeuchi. Nomura requested Tabata as the two had worked <b>well</b> <b>together</b> on previous projects, and Nomura was busy with other projects despite his strong interest. The 3rd Birthday was originally announced in May 2007 as an episodic mobile game developed by Square Enix for Japan's FOMA mobile service. In 2008, during a special Square Enix event, the game was announced to have changed to a game for the PlayStation Portable. Part of the reason, as stated by Nomura, was that the desired level of realism was not possible on mobile phones. The game became exclusive to PSP as Tabata wanted to make full usage of the platform's hardware capabilities, along with it being a gaming platform available worldwide. Tabata and his team worked on The 3rd Birthday {{at the same time as}} fellow mobile-turned-PSP title Final Fantasy Type-0. Square Enix requested Tabata to concentrate on finishing The 3rd Birthday, leading to Type-0 almost being cancelled.|$|E
