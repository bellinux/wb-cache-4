5|$|After World War I, the New York City Subway {{experienced}} {{a surge in}} ridership. By 1920, 1.3 billion annual passengers were riding the subway, compared to 523 million annual riders just seven years before the war. In 1919, the New York Public Service Commission launched a study {{at the behest of}} engineer Daniel L. Turner to determine what improvements were needed in the city's public transport system. Turner's final paper, titled Proposed Comprehensive Rapid Transit System, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> plan calling for new routes under almost every north-south Manhattan avenue, extensions to lines in Brooklyn and Queens, and several crossings of the Narrows to Staten Island. Among the plans were <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> trunk line under Second Avenue consisting of at least six tracks and numerous branches throughout Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx; in turn, the Second and Third Avenue elevated lines were to be knocked down {{to make room for the}} 6-track subway. The paper was revised in January 1927.|$|E

5|$|The album {{sold over}} 100,000 copies in 1995, over {{three times as}} many as their first album sold. This success ensured that Interscope financed the band's third album, Tragic Kingdom, which <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> success, selling 16 million copies {{worldwide}} and attracting extensive interest in the band. The Beacon Street Collection was re-released in 1997 as part of the band's back catalog.|$|E
5|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> {{expansion}} of ploughland during the Song dynasty. The government encouraged people to reclaim barren lands {{and put them}} under cultivation. Anyone who opened up new lands and paid taxes were granted permanent possession of the new land. Under this policy, the cultivated land in the Song dynasty is estimated to have reached a peak number of 720million mu, and was not surpassed by later Ming and Qing dynasties.|$|E
5|$|Alexander I Aldea (14311436) was {{the first}} Romanian ruler {{to be forced to}} render {{military}} service to the Ottomans. Two decades later, Vlad III the Impaler (1448, 14561462, 1476), notorious as the model for the Dracula legend, turned against the Ottoman Empire. He carried out a series of attacks across the Danube in the winter of 14611462. The response <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> invasion led by Mehmed II who drove Vlad III from the throne and replaced him with his brother, Radu III the Fair (14621475). Due to the frequent military operations, the Wallachian Plain was heavily depopulated {{after the end of the}} 14thcentury. On the other hand, Wallachia received a steady flow of immigrants, mostly from the Balkans.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} the year, 100,000 {{copies of}} The Beacon Street Collection had been sold, over three times as many as their first album, No Doubt. These sales were mostly due to the release of Tragic Kingdom, which was {{released}} seven months after The Beacon Street Collection in October 1995. Tragic Kingdom <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> commercial success, reaching sales of over 10 million in the United States and 16 million worldwide, peaking at number one on several charts and being certified Diamond (10,000,000 units) in the US and Canada and Platinum in the UK and Australia. This success created an extensive interest in the band's back catalog so, in October 1997, The Beacon Street Collection was re-released on Interscope.|$|E
5|$|Fatima <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> {{commercial}} hit, earning 200,000gulden on a 7,000gulden budget. Following the film's success, Tan's {{continued to}} cast Roekiah with Rd Mochtar. They became the colony's first on-screen celebrity couple and were termed the Indies' Charles Farrell–Janet Gaynor. The popularity of Roekiah–Rd Mochtar as a screen couple led other studios to follow {{with their own}} romantic pairings. The Teng Chun's Java Industrial Film, for instance, paired Mohamad Mochtar and Hadidjah in Alang-Alang (Grass, 1939).|$|E
5|$|Finding the {{financial}} demands of his Maidstone seat too much, Disraeli secured a Tory nomination for Shrewsbury, winning {{one of the}} constituency's two seats at the 1841 general election, despite serious opposition, and heavy debts which opponents seized on. The election <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> defeat for the Whigs across the country, and Peel became Prime Minister. Disraeli hoped, unrealistically, for ministerial office. Though disappointed at being left on the back benches, he continued his support for Peel in 1842 and 1843, seeking to establish himself as an expert on foreign affairs and international trade.|$|E

5|$|In 1984, the Japanese {{consortium}} of Kawasaki Heavy Industries with Nippon Sharyo, Tokyu Car Corp and Kinki Sharyo was awarded Contract 151 {{at a cost}} of S$581.5 million for the construction of 396 passenger cars. Kawasaki won the contract; its bid—aided by favourable financing from Mitsui and positive economic conditions in Japan—was 12% lower than those of other bidders. The award was the largest single contract awarded in the initial construction of the system. Kawasaki also promised to supply $20.9m worth of complimentary spare parts after delivery. The loss of Contract 151 <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> financial blow to Metro-Cammell, who were forced to reduce their workforce by half later that year.|$|E
5|$|Previously a {{grade-level}} intersection, the underpass {{was constructed}} simultaneously with the subway station costing $250,000. The {{construction of the}} underpass with a subway station underneath <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> undertaking. Three levels were required {{in order for the}} underpass and the subway station to be built. The upper level that was built was Queens Boulevard, which carries traffic east and west. The second level is an underpass that carries four lanes of Union Turnpike (and now also the Jackie Robinson Parkway) under the Boulevard. The tunnel is in between the two mezzanines and it would rest atop the roof of the subway station platform.|$|E
5|$|The Tariff Court {{is a large}} {{rectangular}} enclosure {{south of}} the agora and sharing its northern wall with it. Originally, {{the entrance of the}} court <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> vestibule in its southwestern wall. However, the entrance was blocked by the construction of a defensive wall and the court was entered through three doors from the Agora. The court gained its name by containing a 5 meters long stone slab that had the Palmyrene tax law inscribed on it.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} type of tower used <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> self-supporting delta pylon, or waist pylon, which consumed 21 tonnes {{of steel}} per kilometre of line. This type of pylon {{was used for}} the first 735kV power line from the Manic-Outardes power stations to the load centre of Montreal. There are two significant variations of the delta pylon; one has longer side crossbars such that all three bundles of conductors are suspended on V-shaped insulators. The other has shorter side crossbars, such that the two outside bundles are hung on a vertical insulator string and only the middle bundle is hung with a V-shaped insulator.|$|E
5|$|Upon its release, The College Dropout debuted {{at number}} {{two on the}} US Billboard 200 chart, selling 441,000 copies during its first week. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> {{commercial}} success, producing five singles that achieved chart success, and it received widespread acclaim from critics, earning West several accolades that included a Grammy Award for Best Rap Album at the 47th Grammy Awards. It is West's best-selling album in the United States, with domestic sales of 3.4 million copies and worldwide sales of over 4 million copies. It has been named by Time and Rolling Stone, among other publications, {{as one of the}} greatest albums of all time.|$|E
5|$|A harsh anti-union clampdown {{followed}} the Haymarket incident. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> outpouring {{of community and}} business support for the police and many thousands of dollars were donated to funds for their medical care and to assist their efforts. The entire labor and immigrant community, particularly Germans and Bohemians, came under suspicion. Police raids were carried out on homes and offices of suspected anarchists. Scores of suspects, many only remotely related to the Haymarket affair, were arrested. Casting legal requirements such as search warrants aside, Chicago police squads subjected the labor activists of Chicago to an eight-week shakedown, ransacking their meeting halls and places of business. The emphasis was on the speakers at the Haymarket rally and the newspaper Arbeiter-Zeitung. A small group of anarchists were discovered to {{have been engaged in}} making bombs on the same day as the incident, including round ones like the one used in Haymarket Square.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} of {{the area}} in 1962-1963 suggest that the original settlement was centred {{to the east of}} St Peter's Church, with Mary-le-Port on its western limit. The building of Bristol Castle {{in the latter part of}} the 11th century resulted in the focus of the settlement being moved to the west, where it developed into a symmetrical plan centred on the crossroads of High Street, Wine Street, Broad Street and Corn Street. The area around Mary-le-Port Street was thus the most ancient part of the mediaeval city. Bristol Castle was home to the Norman garrison, and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> structure whose keep was comparable to that of the Tower of London. The castle occupied the whole of the eastern end of today's Castle park, from just east of St Peter's Church to Lower Castle Street.|$|E
5|$|During the 1968 Democratic Convention, {{a motion}} {{had been passed}} to {{establish}} a commission to reform the Democratic Party nomination process. In 1969, McGovern was named chair of the Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection, {{also known as the}} McGovern–Fraser Commission; due to the influence of former McCarthy and Kennedy supporters on the staff, the commission significantly reduced the role of party officials and insiders in the nomination process, increased the role of caucuses and primaries, and mandated quotas for proportional black, female, and youth delegate representation. A somewhat unintended consequence of the commission's reforms <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> {{increase in the number of}} presidential primaries; this became true for the Republican Party as well. The U.S.presidential nominating process has been different ever since, with scholars and politicians debating whether all the changes are for the better.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Army of Africa {{crossed the}} Gibraltar Strait, using Junkers Ju 52 {{transport}} planes provided by Nazi Germany, without any loyalist Air Force interference {{owing to the}} confusion and lack of decision of the Spanish Republican side. The massive airlift of troops from Spanish Morocco was the world's first long-range combat airlift and it allowed Franco's troops to join General Queipo de Llano's forces in Seville. Their quick movement allowed them to meet General Mola's Northern Army and secure most of northern and northwestern Spain, as well as central and western Andalusia. The Republican Government ended up with controlling {{almost all of the}} Eastern Spanish coast and central area around Madrid, as well as Asturias, Cantabria and part of the Basque Country in the north. Mola was keen {{to create a sense of}} fear within Nationalist-controlled areas. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>massive</b> purge of freemasons, and a wide part of the left, including some moderate socialists.|$|E
