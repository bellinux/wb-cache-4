5|$|From 1951 to 1953, Uanna was {{the special}} {{assistant}} to the Secretary of Commerce as Chief of the Facilities Protection Board, and was a staff member of the Industrial Evaluations Board. These boards were overseen by the Interdepartmental Committee on Internal Security (ICIS) and the National Security Resources Board (NSRB). The NSRB was charged with developing security programs for industry and several were developed jointly <b>with</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>from</b> the power, transportation, explosives, petroleum, and communications industries. Since he was directly responsible to the Secretary of Commerce, after the Republican Administration took office in 1953, Uanna found himself without a job.|$|E

5|$|South Park {{originated}} from Parker and Stone's 1992 animated short, Jesus vs. Frosty. The low-budget, crudely made film featured prototypes of South Parks main characters and was followed in 1995 by another short film, Jesus vs. Santa. The latter became popular and was widely shared over the Internet, {{which led to}} talks for a series <b>with</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>from</b> Fox Network and Comedy Central. It debuted on the latter with an initial run of six episodes; due to its success, an additional seven episodes were quickly produced. The complete season was released on DVD in November 2002.|$|E
5|$|The {{governing}} Labour administration led by Gordon Brown {{was defeated}} in the election and lost its overall majority after 13 years in office.

Consequently, senior figures from both parties embarked on a series of make-or-break meetings <b>with</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>from</b> the Liberal Democrats led by Nick Clegg, aimed at forming a coalition government.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, when Unitarist Bernardino Rivadavia {{became the}} {{governor}} of the Buenos Aires province, he held a meeting <b>with</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>from</b> all provinces in Argentina. Facundo was present as {{the governor of}} La Rioja. Rivadavia was soon overthrown, and Manuel Dorrego became the new governor. Sarmiento contends that Dorrego, a Federalist, was interested neither in social progress nor in ending barbaric behaviour in Argentina by improving the level of civilization and education of its rural inhabitants. In the turmoil that characterized Argentine politics at the time, Dorrego was assassinated by Unitarists and Facundo was defeated by Unitarist General José María Paz. Facundo escaped to Buenos Aires and joined the Federalist government of Juan Manuel de Rosas. During the ensuing civil war between the two ideologies, Facundo conquered the provinces of San Luis, Cordoba and Mendoza.|$|E

5|$|In December 1996, Patton {{called a}} special {{legislative}} session {{to consider the}} issue of worker's compensation reform. Both Patton and the state's legislators believed that the generous benefits provided under Kentucky state law created an unfavorable business climate in the state. The reform measures adopted in the special session included a substantial reduction in benefits, including those to coal miners who developed black lung disease. Patton's support of this measure alienated labor leaders, especially in eastern Kentucky's coal mining communities – which had previously been among his strongest supporters. As the law began to take effect, Patton himself agreed that it had gone too far, and his Secretary of Labor worked <b>with</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>from</b> organized labor to draft changes in the law. Those changes were eventually made in the 2002 legislative session.|$|E
5|$|In July 1985, Schwarzkopf {{began an}} 11-month {{assignment}} as Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans at the Pentagon. On July 1, 1986, {{he was promoted}} to lieutenant general, and was reassigned to Fort Lewis as commander of I Corps. He held this post for 14 months before returning to the Pentagon as Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans in August 1987. In a second role, Schwarzkopf served as the Army's senior member on the Military Staff Committee at the United Nations Security Council, where he began to build diplomatic skills in dealings <b>with</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>from</b> other countries. As a part of his duties during the posting, he sat in on arms reduction talks with leaders from the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, the Norwegian Polar Institute took an {{initiative}} to establish DROMLAN {{in cooperation with}} eleven other countries who operate research facilities in Queen Maud Land.

5|$|This {{resulted}} {{in the creation of}} the Pacific War Council, which met for the first time in London on 10 February 1942. Churchill, Clement Attlee (Deputy Prime Minister) and Anthony Eden (Foreign Secretary) represented the United Kingdom, and Earle Page represented Australia, along <b>with</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>from</b> the Netherlands, New Zealand, India and China. Page was replaced as the Australian representative by Stanley Bruce in June 1942. A parallel Pacific War Council was created in Washington, D.C., that first met on 1 April 1942. It was chaired by Roosevelt, with Richard Casey and later Owen Dixon representing Australia, and Prime Minister Mackenzie King representing Canada. The Pacific War Council never became an effective body, and had no influence on strategy, but did allow the Dominions to put their concerns before the President.|$|E
5|$|Today, Haifa {{is governed}} by its 12th city council, headed by the mayor Yona Yahav. The results of {{municipal}} elections decide on {{the makeup of the}} council, similarly to the Knesset elections. The city council is the legislative council in the city, and has the authority to pass auxiliary laws. The 12th council, which was elected in 2003, has 31 members, with the liberal Shinui-Greens ticket holding the most seats (6), and Likud coming second with 5. Many of the decisions passed by the city council are results of recommendation made by the various municipal committees, which are committees where non-municipal organs meet <b>with</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>from</b> the city council. Some committees are spontaneous, but some are mandatory, such as the security committee, tender committee and financial committee.|$|E
5|$|By the 1994 NBA All-Star Game, {{speculation}} as {{to whether}} or not the Timberwolves would remain in Minneapolis following the 1994–95 season became an issue. On February 11, 1994, NBA commissioner David Stern announced that he and his representatives would serve as mediators in an effort to resolve issues related to the debt owed on the Target Center, the Timberwolves home arena. The Timberwolves ownership was seeking a public or private entity to purchase the $73 million remaining on the arena's mortgage, otherwise the team would be sold and in all likelihood moved from Minnesota. Although mediation talks were just beginning to keep the team in place, by the following week it was revealed that ownership had met <b>with</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>from</b> San Diego, Nashville and New Orleans to discuss the potential relocation of the franchise. By late February, New Orleans emerged as the likely city for the team to relocate to if a deal could not be reached to keep the team in Minneapolis. This became the case after the potential ownership group Top Rank signed a letter of intent to purchase the team and move it to New Orleans if debt issues at the Target Center were not resolved.|$|E

5|$|Despite Shinwell's actions {{the fuel}} supply {{remained}} insufficient and blackouts occurred across large swathes of the country, forcing even {{the staff at}} Buckingham Palace, the Houses of Parliament and London's Central Electricity Board to work by candlelight. A trade meeting <b>with</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>from</b> Russia and Iceland was also held without light or heating; one of the items discussed was the purchase of coal from Britain. The public was reduced to queuing at gasworks to collect coke for use as fuel. Supplies of aspirin also ran low {{as it was then}} a product of coal-tar, thousands of chickens in poultry farms died of the cold, and public transport services were cut to save fuel. Shinwell became increasingly unpopular with the general public and received a bomb threat, after which a four-man police guard was stationed at his house in Tooting. Despite this, he remained very popular with the miners, which made the government wary of dismissing him in case it caused industrial action. By 27February sea conditions had improved and more than 100 coal ships had managed to unload their cargoes at the power stations, easing the fuel crisis.|$|E
5|$|During {{her return}} from Korea, Sydney ferried Spitfires and Vampires between several British bases in Southeast Asia. After a brief refit, Sydney {{embarked}} the 20th CAG in June 1952, before proceeding on a round-Australia cruise. The carrier visited Manus Island, was present {{off the coast}} of the Montebello Islands for the first British atomic bomb test, Operation Hurricane, on 3 October, and arrived back in her namesake city in November. On 25 March 1953, Sydney departed for England <b>with</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>from</b> each of the three branches of the Australian and New Zealand militaries for the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The carrier and her aircraft participated in the Coronation Fleet Review on 15 June, and visited Canada, the United States, the Caribbean, Panama, Hawaii, and New Zealand on the return voyage, before reaching Sydney on 15 August. The carrier's 10,000th deck landing occurred during this voyage: a Firefly completed the landing on 17 July, while Sydney was en route to Pearl Harbor.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, plans for Stord Airport, Sørstokken were launched. The bridge plans across Stokksundet were again {{brought up in}} 1982 as the {{industry}} on Bømlo wanted to not have use a ferry to reach the airport. A committee <b>with</b> <b>representatives</b> <b>from</b> all three municipalities was established in May 1983 {{to look into the}} possibilities for a bridge. Led by Bømlo Mayor Arne M. Haldorsen, it issued Engineer Harald Møyner the task to author a report and recommendation. He made three proposals: a pontoon or suspension bridge between Foldrøyhomen and Litlaneset; a suspension bridge between Setraneset and Sokkbleikjo, which would terminate just south of the new airport; and a combined fixed link between Spissøy and Digernes, without passing via the Fitjar Archipelago. The latter was the first time a fixed link to the mainland was proposed. The Norwegian Civil Aviation Administration protested against a possible suspension bridge near the airport, but stated that one closer further away would be fine.|$|E
