That has to be reduced. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of the death tax, {{which is going to}} go to zero in 2010, which is going to create an {{incentive}} – I can't imagine what kind of an incentive it's going to create. It's going to go to zero in 2010. And then in 2011, it's going to go to 55 percent. And we have to make sure that the tax cuts that went into effect, that that level remains. Otherwise, we're going to have one of the biggest tax increases in history in 2011. And I would look to try to regularize the rates and look for some marginal reduction, even beyond what we're doing right now.|$|E

Spence D. of IGN wrote that the song has an [...] "R swoon", similar to Rihanna's previous singles. In an interview with Margeaux Watson for Entertainment Weekly, Rihanna explained {{the meaning of the}} song's lyrics: [...] "'Rehab' is a metaphorical song. Rehab really just means <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> over the guy. So we talk about checking ourselves into rehab, meaning <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> over him. And we compare the guy to a disease or an addiction." [...] Watson further called the song a [...] "lovesick ballad".|$|E

In a Rolling Stone feature showcasing the Vote for Change tour's performers, Vedder told the magazine, [...] "I supported Ralph Nader in 2000, but it's a time of crisis. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a new administration in." ...|$|E

500|$|The first-round {{series against}} the Magic was touted as the matchup {{between two of the}} league's best young big men in Bosh and Dwight Howard. Howard {{dominated}} throughout the series, while Bosh had a serires-best effort in Game 4 with 39 points and 15 rebounds. General Manager Bryan Colangelo said at a press conference after the series, [...] "Whether it's protecting [...] inside the paint, getting {{a little bit more of}} a presence in there, to just getting him another scorer that's going to shoulder some of that burden, it's something that's clear <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> better", hinting that the roster was in need of an overhaul. Bosh said after the loss, [...] "They played a great series, they executed on offence and defense better than we did and when it came to the small things, they did a better job... I can't sit here and bark in protest that the better team didn't win. That's pretty obvious. They beat us pretty good." [...] Unlike the previous campaign, Bosh was not named to any of the All-NBA teams.|$|E
500|$|... "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] {{features}} {{the deaths of}} Patricia and Jimmy, who were both consumed by walkers. Alongside {{the deaths of the}} aforementioned characters, the episode's script initially called for the deaths of Hershel, as well as Shane Walsh and Randall, both of whom had died in the previous installment. Since Kirkman felt {{that there was a lot}} of potential development in Hershel, his death was scrapped from the script. Although plans to write off the character commenced earlier in the season, Mazzara opined that his hypothetical death would have carried no emotional resonance. [...] "The plan was always to whack Hershel, and I actually told Scott Wilson, 'Thanks for everything you've done, but in the next script we're going to kill off your character.' We started writing that and it felt like Hershel's death was playing as a plot device and we were getting no emotional resonance. It was just playing as a gratuitous death. This was one of those examples where we won't play a shocking death for the sense of death; <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> something out of it. We got nothing out of it. If you look at the shot of Hershel looking back and seeing that barn burning and his farm completely lost to the zombies, that shot was well worth it because we see the farm was really a character and you can only see that through Hershel's eyes. So it was the right call to keep him alive." ...|$|E

[...] Palin responded, [...] "I don't want to, sort of, concede that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> used to this kind of thing, because I think the majority of Americans don't want to put up with the blue-bloods– and I say it with all due respect, because I love the Bushes– but, the blue-bloods, who want to pick and choose their winners, instead of allowing competition to pick and choose the winners." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{business}} model of Square Enix {{is centered on}} the idea of [...] "polymorphic content", which consists of developing franchises on multiple potential hardware or media rather than being restricted by a single gaming platform. An early example of this strategy is Enix's Fullmetal Alchemist manga series, which has been adapted into two anime television series, two movies, and several novels and video games. Other polymorphic projects include Compilation of Final Fantasy VII, Code Age, World of Mana, Ivalice Alliance and as of 2016 the ongoing Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy series. According to Yoichi Wada, [...] "It's very difficult to hit the jackpot, as it were. Once we've hit it, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> all the juice possible out of it". Similar to Sony's Greatest Hits program, Square Enix also re-releases their best selling games at a reduced price under a label designated [...] "Ultimate Hits".|$|E
2500|$|Bono {{described}} the song's theme as such: [...] "It {{is a song}} about coming together, but it's not the old hippie idea of 'Let's all live together.' It is, in fact, the opposite. It's saying, We are one, but we're not the same. It's not saying we even want to get along, but that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> along together in this world {{if it is to}} survive. It's a reminder that we have no choice". The Edge described it on one level as a [...] "bitter, twisted, vitriolic conversation between two people who've been through some nasty, heavy stuff". On another level, he suggested that the line [...] "we get to carry each other" [...] introduces [...] "grace" [...] to the song and that the wording [...] "get to" [...] (instead of [...] "got to") is essential, as it suggests that it is a privilege to help one another, not an obligation. The band have been told by many fans that they played the song at their weddings, prompting Bono to respond, [...] "Are you mad? It's about splitting up!" [...] There was some speculation that the song described a conversation between a father and his HIV-positive gay son, based on the connection of the song to David Wojnarowicz, a gay artist who died of AIDS.|$|E
2500|$|In 1822, a [...] "colonization road" [...] (a north-south road to {{facilitate}} settlement) known as Simcoe Street was constructed. It {{more or less}} followed the path of an old native trail known as the Nonquon Road, and ran from the harbour {{to the area of}} Lake Scugog. This intersected the [...] "Kingston Road" [...] at what would become Oshawa's [...] "Four Corners." [...] In 1836, Edward Skae relocated his general store approximately 800 m east to the southeast corner of this intersection; as his store became a popular meeting place (probably because it also served as the Post Office), the corner and the growing settlement that surrounded it, were known as Skae's Corners. In 1842, Skae, the postmaster, applied for official post office status, but was informed the community needed a better name. Moody Farewell was requested to ask his native acquaintances what they called the area; their reply was [...] "Oshawa," [...] which translates to [...] "where we must leave our canoes". Thus, the name of Oshawa, one of the primary [...] "motor cities" [...] of Canada, has the meaning [...] "where <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out and walk". The name [...] "Oshawa" [...] was adopted and the post office named accordingly. In 1849, the requirements for incorporation were eased, and Oshawa was incorporated as a village in 1850.|$|E

[...] In 1992, Spin printed an article by Vedder, entitled [...] "Reclamation", which detailed his views on abortion. Vedder and Pearl Jam have consistently supported abortion rights and performed at Rock for Choice in 1994.
