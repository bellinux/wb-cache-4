The forest {{is home to the}} Grizzly bear, cougar, moose, tens of thousands of elk as well as the largest herd of bighorn sheep in the U.S. The streams in the forest are considered to have some of the best game species fishing opportunities in the U.S. including Yellowstone cutthroat trout. More than 1,300 miles of hiking trails, 32 campgrounds and adjacent forests and parklands provide numerous recreational opportunities. There are four wilderness areas within the forest, protecting {{more than half of the}} managed land area from development. From sagebrush plains through dense spruce and fir forest to craggy mountain peaks, Shoshone National Forest has a rich biodiversity rarely matched in any protected area.|$|E

25|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War two M.F.10s (F.202 and F.204) were still in service with the RNNAS and deployed for neutrality guard duties, both first being based at Karljohansvern naval air station but with F.204 relocation to Kristiansand on 7 March 1940. In the evening of 8 April 1940 it became clear to the commander of Karljohansvern naval air station, Lieutenant Commander Gösta Wendelbo, that the situation was becoming critical and he ordered all flyable aircraft under his command to fly to Oscarsborg Fortress to await the situation. The decision led to the dispatched aircraft becoming caught up in the Battle of Drøbak Sound and lost. Seven aircraft, including M.F.10 F.202, landed near Oscarsborg Fortress and <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>when</b> intense fighting between a German invasion flotilla and Norwegian coastal fortifications began. The aircraft were blocked in the area and soon froze in, making it impossible for them to escape. On 11 April 1940 the leader of the unit's four remaining aircraft, including F.202, disbanded the unit. Four airmen remained trying to get one aircraft airborne, but after a week they removed the machine guns and bombs from the aircraft and left the area, the aircraft eventually being picked up by the Germans and moved to Horten. F.200 did not take part in the neutrality protection duties due to undergoing major maintenance at Marinens Flyvebaatfabrikk in Horten and was captured there on 9 April 1940. F.204, based in Kristiansand, was flown to a fjord west of the port of Lillesand when the German invasion began and destroyed there by its own crew on 10 April 1940.|$|E

John Lederer (1670) testified that the entire Piedmont region had once been occupied by the [...] "Tacci, alias Dogi", but that the Siouan tribes, driven from the northwest, had occupied it for 400 years.

Unfortunately, {{by the time}} Tartar arrived, [...] Guelderland had sailed {{more than a week}} earlier. Bettesworth nevertheless decided to send his boats into the harbour to cut out some merchant vessels and three privateers that <b>were</b> <b>there.</b> <b>When</b> the boats encountered heavy fire and discovered that a heavy chain protected the ships in the harbour, they and Bettesworth returned to Tartar. However, as Tartar tried to withdraw, she came [...] attack from the schooner Odin and between three and six gunboats (accounts differ). Cannon fire from the Norwegians killed Bettesworth and a midshipman, Henry FitzHugh, early in the action. A further twelve men were wounded before Tartar was able to complete her [...] withdrawal.

2500|$|Harriman, {{her husband}} and {{daughter}} found themselves {{in the middle of}} Europe as World War I erupted in the summer of 1914. Hoping that the healing waters in the Bohemian spa in Karlsbad would benefit her husband, Harriman brought her family to Europe in June 1914. After meeting with leading British and French officials while relations between the European powers deteriorated, they traveled through France to Karlsbad (then a part of Austria-Hungary), and <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>when</b> Austria-Hungary attacked Serbia in late July. After leaving Karlsbad on the last train crossing the frontier through Germany to France, they eventually returned to New York on an armed British vessel, the RMS Adriatic. [...] Her husband's health continued to deteriorate, and he died on December 1, 1914. His prolonged illness, the resulting lack of income, and the expense of maintaining several homes had consumed nearly all of his net worth. [...] Harriman never remarried.|$|E
2500|$|Various {{scholars}} {{have used a}} synthesis of evidence to present models to suggest {{an answer to the}} questions that surround the Anglo-Saxon settlement. These questions include: How many migrants <b>were</b> <b>there?</b> <b>When</b> did the [...] "Saxons" [...] gain political ascendency? What happened to the 'Romano-Brittonic' peoples in the south-east of Britain? The Anglo-Saxons were a mix of invaders, migrants and acculturated indigenous people. The ratios and relationships between these formative elements {{at the time of the}} Anglo-Saxon settlement are the subject of enquiry. The traditional interpretation of the settlement of Britain has been subject to profound reappraisal, with scholars embracing the evidence for both migration and acculturation. [...] Heinrich Härke explains the nature of this agreement: [...] "It is now widely accepted that the Anglo-Saxons were not just transplanted Germanic invaders and settlers from the Continent, but the outcome of insular interactions and changes. But we are still lacking explicit models that suggest how this ethnogenetic process might have worked in concrete terms".|$|E
2500|$|The 53rd Reserve Division {{initially}} {{fought on}} the Western Front, entering {{the line in}} mid-October. As part of the so-called Race to the Sea, it fought in the Battle of the Yser in October–November 1914. [...] It remained in positional warfare and fighting along the Yser until April 1915, and then was engaged in fighting in the Second Battle of Ypres. [...] After that battle, the division returned to the line on the Yser until September. [...] After {{a brief period of}} rest, the division fought against the French offensive in the Second Battle of Champagne. [...] The division again went into army reserve from the end of October 1915 to the end of January 1916, after which it returned to the line on the Yser and then in the Flanders and Artois regions. [...] It saw several weeks' action in the Battle of the Somme, and then returned to positional warfare in the line. [...] In November 1916, the division was transferred to the Eastern Front, where it engaged in positional warfare until June 1917. [...] It then fought against the Russian Kerensky Offensive and in follow-on fighting in Galicia and on the Ukrainian border. [...] At the end of November 1917, the division was transferred back to the Western Front, arriving in mid-December at border defense positions on the Belgian-Dutch border. [...] After a few months there and then in the line in Flanders and the Artois, the division fought in the 1918 German Spring Offensive, seeing action in the First Battle of the Somme (1918), also known as the Second Battle of the Somme (to distinguish it from the 1916 battle). [...] After that battle, the division went to the Verdun region to recover, and then in June went to the Soisson region, where it saw action in July–August in the Second Battle of the Marne. [...] The division suffered heavily and was relieved on August 10. [...] It went to the Argonne region to be dissolved; some of its understrength units <b>were</b> <b>there</b> <b>when</b> the Meuse-Argonne Offensive began and they were sent to the line to bolster other divisions in the face of American attacks. Allied intelligence considered the division as mediocre in 1917 and rated it third class in 1918.|$|E
