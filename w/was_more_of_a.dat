5|$|In September 1918, Eleanor was {{unpacking}} one of Franklin's suitcases {{when she}} discovered a bundle of love letters to him from her social secretary, Lucy Mercer. He had been contemplating leaving Eleanor for Lucy. However, following pressure from his political advisor, Louis Howe, and from his mother, who threatened to disinherit Franklin if he followed through with a divorce, the couple remained married. Their union {{from that point on}} <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> political partnership. Disillusioned, Eleanor again became active in public life, and focused increasingly on her social work rather than her role as a wife, as she had for the previous decade.|$|E

For example, the basic gameplay of fighting game can be deconstructed to attack and defense, or punch, kick, block, dodge and throw; {{which can be}} further deconstructed to strong/weak punch/kick. For this reason, game mechanics <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> engineering concept while gameplay <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> design concept.|$|R
5|$|Sotomayor was {{appointed}} by Mayor Ed Koch in 1988 {{as one of the}} founding members of the New York City Campaign Finance Board, where she served for four years. There she took a vigorous role in the board's implementation of a voluntary scheme wherein local candidates received public matching funds in exchange for limits on contributions and spending and agreeing to greater financial disclosure. Sotomayor showed no patience with candidates who failed to follow regulations and <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stickler for making campaigns follow those regulations than some of the other board members. She joined in rulings that fined, audited, or reprimanded the mayoral campaigns of Koch, David Dinkins, and Rudy Giuliani.|$|E
5|$|The final polls {{from before}} the {{announcement}} of candidates gave Labour a four-point lead over the Conservative Party. From early in the campaign, the contest was presumed to be between the Labour and Conservative candidates, with both expected to comfortably reach {{the second round of}} voting. While Goldsmith – who was the last of the main candidates to be announced, on 3 October 2015 – was widely anticipated to be the Conservative candidate, Khan's selection <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> surprise.|$|E
5|$|Vandersteen {{could no}} longer handle the work load on his own. In 1949, he hired his first collaborator, François-Joseph Herman. Herman stayed with Vandersteen only three years, but his tenure {{was the start of}} the large Studio Vandersteen, which has {{continued}} the series. He was followed by Karel Boumans in 1952, who was an anonymous contributor until 1959. He worked mainly for De grappen van Lambik, a Suske en Wiske spin-off Vandersteen created for the weekly newspaper De Bond, which ran from 24 January 1954 on. But he also inked many Suske en Wiske comics, including those in Tintin. Vandersteen devoted himself more and more towards the storytelling and the initial pencil drawing, which he considered the artistic process, while the inking <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> craft.|$|E

5|$|Episode IIs soundtrack {{was first}} {{released}} as an album on July 7, 2004 as Xenosaga II: Jenseits Von Gut und Böse Movie Scene Soundtrack by Victor Entertainment. Including only Kajiura's work, the album spans two discs and 40 tracks {{and has a}} duration of 1:52:26. Another soundtrack album for the game, Xenosaga Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und Böse Soundtrack, was released by Namco and Brady Games as a promotional extra for the Brady Games strategy guide for the game. The 11-track CD again excluded the work of Hosoe, instead sampling Kajiura's pieces. Released on February 17, 2005, the album has a duration of 30:25. The Movie Scene album reached position #46 on the Japanese Oricon charts. In the liner notes for Movie Scene Soundtrack, Kajiura claims that she felt that her work for the game was different from her previous pieces, as it <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> soundtrack, with the individual tunes fitting more closely together. She also said that she {{found it easier to}} compose tracks that fit with the worldview that Mitsuda had created for the first game, rather than invent her own. She also notes that she intended tracks 1—4 to be a single, continuous piece, although they were broken up in the game; she intended tracks 20 and 21 the same way.|$|E
5|$|Ibira {{initially}} pictured Karas as {{a horror}} {{story with a}} vengeance theme. It had a simple plot similar to the manga, Dororo. The protagonist karas is on a quest, slaughtering mikuras to recover the body parts of his murdered lover. Until he recovers all the parts, he assembles them into a katana to kill the mikuras. The final version of Karas <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> superhero action story, and originally intended for three leading heroes {{in the same vein}} as the Japanese period drama, Sanbiki ga Kiru!. The characters Otoha, Nue, and the human detective Kure were the leads but the final version primarily focused on Otoha. The presentation of Karas differs in several ways from typical anime. The show maintains a serious tone and never indulges in slapstick, exaggerated facial expressions, or super deformed characters. It avoids heavy expositions. Dialogue tends to be short and viewers have to infer what is going on based on very little presented information. The team had left out substantial amounts of information from the show, printing them in a booklet of the final DVD package.|$|E
5|$|Pompey and Crassus proved {{themselves}} to be as incompetent as Caesar had hoped. Clodius terrorized the city with his armed gangs, and agitated Pompey {{to such a degree}} that Pompey was able to secure the passage of a law in 57 BC which recalled Cicero from his exile. This <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> triumph for the senate than it was for Pompey, however, since Pompey was allied with Caesar. Pompey was so inept that the senate decided to override him, and rescind the land laws that Caesar had passed in 59 BC for Pompey's veterans. This forced a renewal of the triumvirate: Pompey and Crassus were promised the Consulship in 55 BC and Caesar's term as governor was extended for five years. Caesar's daughter, and Pompey's wife, Julia, soon died in childbirth, and a year later, Crassus was killed during his invasion of the Parthian Empire. These two events severed the last remaining bond between Pompey and Caesar.|$|E

50|$|Consumer {{neuroscience}} {{is similar}} to neuroeconomics and neuromarketing, but subtle, yet distinct differences exist between them. Neuroeconomics <b>is</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> academic field while neuromarketing and consumer neuroscience <b>are</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> applied science. Neuromarketing focuses {{on the study of}} various marketing techniques and attempts to integrate neuroscience knowledge to help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of said marketing strategies. Consumer neuroscience is unique among the three because the main focus is on the consumer and how various factors affect individual preferences and purchasing behavior.|$|R

25|$|Sales figures {{revealed}} to Chevrolet management that the Corvair <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> specialty car than a competitor to the conventionally designed Ford Falcon or Chrysler's Valiant.

25|$|Deep Elm Records releas {{a series}} of eleven {{compilation}} albums, The Emo Diaries, from 1997 to 2007. Emphasizing unreleased music from unsigned bands, the series included Jimmy Eat World, Further Seems Forever, Samiam and The Movielife. Its diversity of bands and musical styles indicated that emo <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shared aesthetic than a genre, and the series helped define the term in the underground-music community.|$|E
25|$|By the 1930s, the {{steamboat}} {{service to}} the school <b>was</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> tradition than a necessity, and it was losing clientele Bay-wide due to the increased usage of automobiles.

50|$|A new ACD Version-II, {{now called}} the Train Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), is under {{development}} by The Research Designs and Standards Organisation (RDSO).

25|$|Though these {{ten commandments}} are often {{accepted}} {{to be what}} knights would use, they would not necessarily be what a knight actually followed in the medieval era.
