6000|$|George {{was very}} cheerful; but I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> my message. When he had {{finished}} the feeding, and had at last sat down to milk, I said: ...|$|E
60|$|It was stimulating. The {{probability}} {{was that}} all Jerry Nichols <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> {{was that he had}} received stable information about some horse or had been given a box for the Empire, but for all that it was stimulating.|$|E
50|$|I cannot see a child without <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> {{how much}} God loves him.|$|R
5000|$|She <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> {{that she}} loves him so, and will {{until the day}} she dies ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, no, Katharine. Please {{stay and}} help me. You see--you see--I told William I'd read a little every day. And I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that I've begun when he comes." ...|$|R
6000|$|The reproachful superiority in Charmian's {{tone was}} bitter to Cornelia, {{but she did}} not even attempt to resent it. She said meekly, [...] "I did try to tell him. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> the very first thing, but he wouldn't let me, then; and then--I couldn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That we're {{going to}} have an infant," [...] she sobbed, [...] "and he's never, never let me, not once, every time I've come to him, he's been horrid to me, and I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> I did. And he won't let me--he's cruel to me." ...|$|E
60|$|Joan {{dropped the}} gun and sank beside him, helpless, horror-stricken, {{wringing}} her hands. She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> she was sorry, that he drove her to it, that he must let her pray for him. But she could not speak. Her tongue clove {{to the roof of}} her mouth and she seemed strangling.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{just had}} a talk with Mr. Compton," [...] he replied. [...] "He sent for me and I had <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> {{something}} that I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> although he's got to find it out sooner or later anyway." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{ask him to}} wait," [...] she said. [...] "I {{have just}} found my father, and I <b>want</b> it <b>to</b> be just we two for a while. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> {{he will have to}} wait." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have got}} so much to say to him," [...] she {{answered}} impatiently, [...] "I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> how deeply I feel for him, and how anxious I am to make his life a happier one if I can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I had to {{go right}} past the big oak {{in order to get}} home, and when I was there the most {{sensible}} thing I could do was to stop and have a chat with President Crow, for I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> how well I'd served out young Mr. Fox.|$|E
6000|$|He spoke so heartily {{and was so}} {{kind that}} Ben looked up, feeling that he had given {{him one of the}} sweetest things in the world--friendship; he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> so, but {{did not know how to}} do it, so caught up his hoe and fell to work, saying, in a tone Thorny {{understood}} better than words,-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{went back}} to assist a nurse who had come in, and all that night we had our hands full with my husband. We had to call in the doctor, and he was really not out of danger until noon of the next day. I had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> about sending the miniatures over to the Wadsworth house, {{but he was in}} no {{condition}} to be told anything, so I kept silent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am clever {{enough for}} that," [...] he said, quietly, almost with indifference. [...] "You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> of a hiding-place {{big enough to}} take days in ransacking--a place where a {{treasure}} of silver ingots can be buried without leaving {{a sign on the}} surface." ...|$|R

50|$|At {{a dinner}} {{with all the}} local 'nobs' {{organized}} by Sybil, Vimes discovers the distaste the local people have towards goblins, calling them vermin and a nuisance. At the dinner, he also meets Miss Felicity Beedle, a children's book author, and he feels that she has something she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> about a possible crime.|$|R
60|$|Juliana never forgave that drive. She {{continued}} bitter towards Phoebe, {{and kept}} such a watch {{over her and}} Sir Bevil, that the jealous surveillance became palpable to both. Sir Bevil really wanted to tell Phoebe the unsatisfactory result of his pleading for Robert; she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> of Robert's gratitude for his offered gift; but the exchange of any words in private was out of their power, and each silently {{felt that it was}} best to make no move towards one another till the unworthy jealousy should have died away.|$|E
60|$|In {{asking this}} question, Mr. Irwine pushed his plate away, threw himself {{back in his}} chair, and looked {{straight}} at Arthur. He really suspected that Arthur <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> something, and thought of smoothing the way for him by this direct question. But he was mistaken. Brought suddenly and involuntarily {{to the brink of}} confession, Arthur shrank back and felt less disposed towards it than ever. The conversation had taken a more serious tone than he had intended--it would quite mislead Irwine--he would imagine there was a deep passion for Hetty, while there was no such thing. He was conscious of colouring, and was annoyed at his boyishness.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I didn't {{think it}} out at the time. But I don't deny that I had a {{satisfaction}} {{in the notion of}} the hornets' nest he was poking his thick head into. It makes me sick, now, to think I had. I oughtn't to have let him; he was perfectly innocent in it. After the letter went, I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> but I couldn't; and then I took the chances too. I don't believe he could have ever got forward in politics; he's too honest--or he isn't dishonest in the right way. But that doesn't let me out. I don't defend myself! I did wrong; I behaved badly. But I've suffered for it.|$|E
5000|$|During {{their next}} session, Melfi begins to weep when Tony agrees {{to see the}} behaviorist, and he tries to comfort her. Tony asks her what is wrong, but she persuades him to sit back down and {{continue}} the session. Tony asks Melfi if she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> something. After a tense pause, Melfi says, [...] "No." ...|$|R

50|$|In {{the prologue}} {{to the film}} (taking place in 1911) we learn that, being unable {{to care for her}} baby, Mary Bancroft (Elsie Ferguson), had to give her up for adoption. Years later (in 1930), we find Bancroft as a {{successful}} female lawyer in New York. She refuses to marry District Attorney John Remington (John Halliday), because she doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> about her unfortunate past.|$|R
6000|$|If {{there had}} been any sympathy between mother and child, Neelie might have owned the truth. She might have said frankly: [...] "I am looking ill, because my life is miserable to me. I am fond of Mr. Armadale, and Mr. Armadale was once fond of me. We had one little disagreement, only one, in which I was to blame. I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> so at the time, and I have <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> so ever since; and Miss Gwilt stands between us and {{prevents}} me. She has made us like strangers; she has altered him, and taken him away from me. He doesn't look at me as he did; he doesn't speak to me as he did; he is never alone with me {{as he used to}} be; I can't say the words to him that I long to say; and I can't write to him, for it would look as if I wanted to get him back. It is all over between me and Mr. Armadale; and it is that woman's fault. There is ill-blood between Miss Gwilt and me the whole day long; and say what I may, and do what I may, she always gets the better of me, and always puts me in the wrong. Everything I saw at Thorpe Ambrose pleased me, everything I did at Thorpe Ambrose made me happy, before she came. Nothing pleases me, and nothing makes me happy now!" [...] If Neelie had ever been accustomed to ask her mother's advice and to trust herself to her mother's love, she might have said such words as these. As it was, the tears came into her eyes, and she hung her head in silence.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was hard}} not to. She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> that he was all wrong--at least, so {{far as she was}} concerned. It. was not the conqueror she loved in him; it was the fighter. Not in the hour of triumph but in the hour of despair she would have yearned to put her arms about him. [...] "Unpopularity, abuse, failure," [...] it was against the fear of such that she would have guarded him. Yes, she had dreamed of {{leadership}}, influence, command. But it was the leadership of the valiant few against the hosts of the oppressors that she claimed. Wealth, honours! Would she have given up a life of ease, shut herself off from society, if these had been her standards? [...] "Mesalliance!" [...] Had the male animal no instinct, telling it when it was loved with all a woman's being, so that any other union would be her degradation.|$|E
60|$|A {{telegram}} {{had been}} sent to George, and it was supposed that he would arrive at Lady Kelsey's during the evening. Lucy <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> herself what had happened. But she could not wait till then to see her father, and persuaded Dick to drive with her from the station to Shaftesbury Avenue. Fred Allerton was not in. Lucy wanted to go into the flat and stay there till he came, but the porter had no key and did not know when he would return. Dick was much relieved. He was afraid that the excitement and the anxiety from which Fred Allerton had suffered, would have caused him to drink heavily; and he could not let Lucy see him the worse for liquor. He induced her, after leaving a note to say that she would call early next morning, to go quietly home. When they arrived at Charles Street, where was Lady Kelsey's house, they found a wire from George to say he could not get up to town till the following day.|$|E
50|$|Irisa (Stephanie Leonidas) steals a terra sphere {{from the}} E-Rep but Nolan (Grant Bowler) stops {{her before she}} escapes and returns the sphere to the E-Rep {{soldiers}} covering her. He asks her {{what is going on}} but Irisa does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him,</b> so he cuffs her and takes her everywhere with him till he knows why she stole the sphere and what she wanted it for.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mercy! mercy!" [...] {{cried the}} unhappy man, [...] "I swear that I did not murder the man. I have made my pile down at Bigbear Gully, and I'll give it all--every cent--if you will wait {{to have the}} matter examined. Stay," [...] he added, seeing that they paid no heed to him, [...] "let me speak one word, before I die, with Mr Allfrey. I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> where my gold lies hid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, don't go {{anywhere}} till Allen gets back," [...] said Paul. [...] "I <b>want</b> you <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> yourself {{all you know}} concerning Uncle Barnaby." ...|$|R
60|$|Cornelia {{look the}} tea and drank it, {{but she could}} not speak. It would have been easier to bear if she had only had herself alone to blame, but mixed with her shame, and with her pity for him, was a sense of his want of wisdom in refusing to let her speak at once, when she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> all about Dickerson. That was her instinct; she had been right, and he wrong; she might be to blame for {{everything}} since, but he was to blame then and for that. Now it was all wrong, and past undoing. She tried, in the reveries running along with what she was hearing of Charmian's talk, every way of undoing it that she could imagine: she wrote to Ludlow; she sent for him; she went to him; but it was all impossible. She did not wish to undo the wrong that she might have back her dream of happiness again; she had been willing to be less than true, and she could wish him to know that she hated herself for that.|$|E
6000|$|At {{first the}} two companions talked very little. Sir Richmond was well content with this tacit {{friendliness}} and Miss Grammont was preoccupied {{because she was}} very strongly moved to tell him things about herself that hitherto she had told to no one. It was not merely that she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> these things but also that for reasons she did not put as yet very clearly to herself she thought they were things he ought to know. She talked of herself at first in general terms. [...] "Life comes on anyone with a rush, childhood seems lasting for ever and then suddenly one tears into life," [...] she said. It was even more so for women {{than it was for}} men. You are shown life, a crowded vast spectacle full of what seems to be intensely interesting activities and endless delightful and frightful and tragic possibilities, and you have hardly had time to look at it before you are called upon to make decisions. And there is something in your blood that urges you to decisive acts. Your mind, your reason resists. [...] "Give me time," [...] it says. [...] "They clamour at you with treats, crowds, shows, theatres, all sorts of things; lovers buzz at you, each trying to fix you part of his life when you are trying to get clear to live a little of your own." [...] Her father had had one merit at any rate. He had been jealous of her lovers and very ready to interfere.|$|E
60|$|It {{had been}} Lady Harman's clear {{intention}} {{to have a}} luminous and illuminating discussion of the peculiar difficulties and perplexities of her position with Mr. Brumley. Since their first encounter this idea {{had grown up in}} her mind. She was one of those women who turn instinctively to men and away from women for counsel. There was to her perception something wise and kindly and reassuring in him; she felt that he had lived and suffered and understood and that he was ready to help other people to live; his heart she knew from his published works was buried with his dead Euphemia, and he seemed as near a thing to a brother and a friend as she was ever likely to meet. She <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> all this and then to broach her teeming and tangled difficulties, about her own permissible freedoms, about her social responsibilities, about Sir Isaac's business. But now as their taxi dodged through the traffic of Kensington High Street and went on its way past Olympia and so out westwards, she found it extremely difficult to fix her mind upon the large propositions with which it had been her intention to open. Do as she would to feel that this was a momentous occasion, she could not suppress, she could not ignore an obstinate and entirely undignified persuasion that she was having a tremendous lark. The passing vehicles, various motors, omnibuses, vans, carriages, the thronging pedestrians, the shops and houses, were all so distractingly interesting that at last she had to put it fairly to herself whether she hadn't better resign herself to the sensations of the present and reserve that sustained discussion for an interval she foresaw as inevitable on some comfortable seat under great trees at Hampton Court. You cannot talk well and penetratingly about fundamental things when you are in a not too well-hung taxi which is racing to get ahead of a vast red motor-omnibus....|$|E

At the barbecue, Damon plans to stab Mason with a silver knife since according to the stories, silver can harm werewolves. Mason is ready to leave for the barbecue when Tyler (Michael Trevino) asks <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> about werewolves. Mason does not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him</b> because he believes there is no need for him to know and he leaves.|$|R
5000|$|Voiced by Matthew Geczy. He is the {{principal}} of Pinkerton School and has no idea about I.N.K. or the evil schemes of Miss Macbeth. He is very popular with the pupils at the school and is also obsessed with butterflies, and Miss Macbeth sometimes takes advantage of this. He is fair and kind and discourages any violence. It is hinted in [...] "The Truth, The Whole Truth" [...] that he might know who Vin's parents are but he doesn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R
