25|$|He was {{introduced}} to amateur sumo <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> boy. Through his judo coach Riho Rannikmaa, and an official from the Kagoshima Prefecture Sumo Association, Kazuo Kurazono, encouraged him to join the professional sport. Due to the restrictions on foreigners entering sumo, the only stable with a place available was Mihogaseki. He was given the shikona or fighting name of Baruto, {{a reference to the}} Japanese name of the Baltic sea, and made his professional debut in May 2004. He moved very quickly up the rankings, reaching the jūryō division after only 8 tournaments (tied for the third-fastest rise to sekitori status since 1958 when the current six-tournament-a-year format was adopted) and compiling a record of 41–8 on the way.|$|E
25|$|HenryVIII's wife, Catherine of Aragon, {{had first}} {{been married to}} Henry's elder brother Arthur <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over fifteen years old, but Arthur had died {{just a few months}} later. Henry later used this to justify the {{annulment}} of his marriage to Catherine, arguing that her marriage to Arthur had created an affinity between Henry and Catherine; as his brother's wife, under canon law she became his sister. When Mary's sister Anne later became Henry's wife, this same canon law might also support that a similar affinity had been created between Henry and Anne due to his earlier liaison with Mary. In 1527, during his initial attempts to obtain a papal annulment of his marriage to Catherine, Henry also requested a dispensation to marry Anne, the sister of his former mistress.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written to humanize Sawyer {{and set up}} the love {{triangle}} between him, Kate and Jack. Kate was meant to look at Sawyer in a new way, and, according to Lindelof, think, [...] "wow, this guy is not just a belligerent." [...] The episode also shows the moral ambiguity of some characters by revealing more of their personalities, with the ones introduced as protagonists doing things that are generally not viewed as protagonist-like– an example being Jack beating Sawyer and eventually asking Sayid to torture him; and an antagonistic character, Sawyer, proving not to be solely antagonist-like– an example being his backstory and flashback, which show that he is not exclusively evil. Lindelof explained that he wanted Sawyer to [...] "come out of his shell a little, and say to the audience, 'you're supposed to like this guy'", further explaining, [...] "the root of him being an asshole is that these horrible things happened to him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> kid, and he's really really angry." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aeon's {{music is}} {{composed}} by Nilsson and Dlimi; the lyrics are written by Dahlström. According to Allmusic, Aeon plays [...] "uncommonly intense, technically proficient, high-velocity brand of death metal". Alex Webster of Cannibal Corpse stated: [...] "Aeon's musicianship {{is among the}} best in death metal, but their songwriting is what truly sets them apart. It's rare to find a death metal band that is simultaneously crushingly brutal and infectiously catchy." [...] Nilsson stated: [...] "Tom [...] has had his problems with Jehovah's Witnesses who live by him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> younger. They actually were visiting him a lot, trying to convert him to Christian", which resulted in Aeon's anti-Christian lyrics.|$|E
2500|$|Sigler calls Stephen King a [...] "'master craftsman', {{who writes}} from the 'regular guy' strata {{from which he}} hails. His older stuff had no pretense, no 'higher message,' no 'I’m {{extremely}} important' attitude, just rock-solid storytelling and character development. He also would whack any character at any time, and that’s what hooked you in – when characters got into trouble, you didn’t know if they’d live, unlike 99% of the books {{out there that are}} trying to develop franchise characters." [...] According to Sigler, Jack London's [...] "The Sea Wolf totally changed my views on life". Sigler saw King Kong (1976 version) <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> kid. He said it, [...] "Scared the crap out of me. I hid behind my dad’s shoulder and begged to leave the theatre. As soon as we were out, I asked when we could see it again – that was the moment I knew I wanted to tell monster stories. I wanted to have that same impact on other people." ...|$|E
