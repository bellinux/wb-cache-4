60|$|Curiously enough, at {{this same}} time, {{a man was}} {{crouching}} behind some bushes in {{the centre of the}} pass towards which these two boys were approaching.

This lovely specimen of humanity sat down on a rock, and waited, and fidgeted; and the expression of his sweet face betrayed, from time to time, that he was impatient, and anything but easy in his mind.|$|R
5|$|The Pasiphae {{group is}} quite dispersed, with a spread over 1.3Gm, inclinations between 144.5° and 158.3°, and eccentricities between 0.25 and 0.43.

5|$|After {{her husband}} died in 1841, a series of {{complications}} obstructed Hańska's marriage to Balzac. Chief of these was the estate and her daughter Anna's inheritance, both of <b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> threatened if she married him. Anna married a Polish count, easing some of the pressure. About the same time, Hańska gave Balzac the idea for his 1844 novel Modeste Mignon. In 1850 they finally married, and moved to Paris, but he died five months later. Though she never remarried, she took several lovers, and died in 1882.|$|E
5|$|In 2016 a {{breakthrough}} in creating a strong light aluminium steel alloy <b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> suitable in applications such as aircraft was announced by researchers at Pohang University of Science and Technology.

5|$|In Scandinavian folklore, {{a diverse}} array of human-like supernatural beings are attested <b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> thought of as elves and which might partly {{originate}} in medieval Scandinavian beliefs. However, the characteristics and names of these beings has varied widely across time and space, and they cannot be neatly categorised. These beings are sometimes known by words descended directly from Old Norse álfr. However, in the modern languages, these traditional terms {{have tended to be}} replaced with other terms. Things are further {{complicated by the fact that}} when referring to the elves of Old Norse mythology, scholars have adopted new forms based directly on the Old Norse word álfr. The following table summarises the situation in the main modern standard languages of Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s the Soviet {{authorities}} {{began the}} widespread use of psychiatric treatment as a form of punishment and deterrence for the independent-minded. This involved unlimited detention in a psikhushka, as such places were popularly known, <b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> conventional psychiatric hospitals or psychiatric prison-hospitals set up (e.g. the Leningrad Special Psychiatricl Hospital) as part of an existing penal institution. Healthy individuals were held among mentally ill and often dangerous patients; they were forced to take various psychotropic drugs; they might also be incarcerated in prison-type institutions under overall control of the KGB.|$|E
5|$|It {{is often}} {{held that the}} Renown and Courageous classes were {{designed}} for Fisher's plan to land troops (possibly Russian) on the German Baltic coast. Specifically, they were designed with a reduced draught, <b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> important in the shallow Baltic. This is not clear-cut evidence that the ships were designed for the Baltic: it was considered that earlier ships had too much draught and not enough freeboard under operational conditions. Roberts argues that {{the focus on the}} Baltic was probably unimportant at the time the ships were designed, but was inflated later, after the disastrous Dardanelles Campaign.|$|E

He was also expected to be qualified to do the duty of an able seaman and midshipman.|$|E

5|$|Some of the {{information}} contained in the Liber is important to historians. It is in the Liber that the first statement that Æthelwold translated the Benedictine Rule into Old English is made. The Liber is the longest of the local histories produced in England during the 12th century, and it contains a description of the royal chancery, <b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> the earliest evidence for the existence of that office in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. The Liber describes how King Edgar (died 975) granted the abbey the office of chancellor (head of the chancery), but the authenticity of the passage is unclear. The existence of a formal chancery office in Anglo-Saxon England before the Norman Conquest is a matter of some debate amongst historians.|$|E

5|$|The case of Ellis v. Dubowski (1921) {{lays down}} the {{principle}} {{that there can be}} no delegation of authority to an absolute body from which no right of appeal exists. In this case, a licensing committee exercising statutory powers to license cinemas to be used for film screenings had imposed a condition in a licence that films had to be certified by the British Board of Film Censors before they could be shown. This was found to be ultra vires because the Board should not be made the final dictator. Furthermore, the fact that the Board had been given absolute power to prohibit films for reasons <b>which</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> private or influenced by trade considerations was sufficient to render the condition ultra vires.|$|E

In the weeks preceding the landings, lists of messages and their meanings were distributed to resistance groups. An increase in radio activity on 5 June was correctly interpreted by German intelligence to mean that an invasion was imminent or underway. However, because of the barrage of previous false warnings and misinformation, most units ignored the warning.|$|E
