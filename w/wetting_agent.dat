Second-generation silicone hydrogels, such as galyfilcon A (Acuvue Advance, Vistakon) and senofilcon A (Acuvue Oasys, Vistakon), use the Tanaka monomer. Vistakon improved the Tanaka monomer even further and added other molecules, which serve as an internal <b>wetting</b> <b>agent.</b>|$|E

40|$|Soil hydrophobia, {{or water}} repellency, in the coarse sand {{typical of the}} Swan Coastal Plain in Perth in Western Australia is common, leading to reduced ater infiltration. The main {{practice}} recommended to alleviate water repellency {{is the use of}} <b>wetting</b> <b>agents,</b> most of which are surfactantbased. Five commercial <b>wetting</b> <b>agents</b> were evaluated for their effects on water infiltration into samples of native sandy soils. Capillary rise and double-ring infiltrometer methods were used for this purpose. The infiltration of water was somewhat improved with the application of <b>wetting</b> <b>agents,</b> but this was short-lived and, when measured a few days later, was similar to or lower than the infiltration in the untreated sand. These findings raise questions on the efficiency of surfactantbased <b>wetting</b> <b>agents</b> to treat waterrepellent soils. Further investigation into the interaction and adsorption between surfactants and soil particles is needed.

40|$|Abstract. As {{the effect}} of density {{separation}} for waste plastic mixtures was poor, this research studied the impacts of <b>wetting</b> <b>agents</b> on the sorting rates of waste plastic mixtures and the mechanisms of <b>wetting</b> <b>agents</b> in density separation. The {{results showed that the}} surface activity of plastics could be changed by <b>wetting</b> <b>agents</b> and thus the sorting rates of plastics under the density separation system could be improved. Impacts of <b>wetting</b> <b>agents</b> such as CaLS, NP- 7 and MC on density separation of plastics are related not only to the molecular structure of plastic materials but also to the separating media. The density separation system in the presence of different <b>wetting</b> <b>agents</b> established in this research separated the target plastic with a rate of 100 %, which applied to a mixture of 9 kinds of common plastics such as PVC, PC, PS and so on...|$|R

25|$|There are {{two main}} types of fire extinguishers: stored-{{pressure}} and cartridge-operated. In stored pressure units, the expellant is stored in the same chamber as the firefighting agent itself. Depending on the agent used, different propellants are used. With dry chemical extinguishers, nitrogen is typically used; water and foam extinguishers typically use air. Stored pressure fire extinguishers {{are the most common}} type. Cartridge-operated extinguishers contain the expellant gas in a separate cartridge that is punctured prior to discharge, exposing the propellant to the extinguishing agent. This type is not as common, used primarily in areas such as industrial facilities, where they receive higher-than-average use. They have the advantage of simple and prompt recharge, allowing an operator to discharge the extinguisher, recharge it, and return to the fire in a reasonable amount of time. Unlike stored pressure types, these extinguishers use compressed carbon dioxide instead of nitrogen, although nitrogen cartridges are used on low temperature (-60 rated) models. Cartridge operated extinguishers are available in dry chemical and dry powder types in the U.S. and in water, <b>wetting</b> <b>agent,</b> foam, dry chemical (classes ABC and B.C.), and dry powder (class D) types {{in the rest of the}} world.|$|E
2500|$|Cold Fire, is an organic, {{eco-friendly}} <b>wetting</b> <b>agent</b> {{that works}} by cooling, and by encapsulating the hydrocarbon fuel, which prevents it from entering into the combustion reaction. Bulk Cold Fire {{is used in}} booster tanks and is acceptable for use in CAFS systems. Cold Fire is UL listed for A and B fires only, though the manufacturer claims it is effective on class D and [...] "grease" [...] fires, which implies class K capability. End users should be cautious about agents use on fires outside of their UL listing, despite sales claims. Aerosol versions are preferred by users for cars, boats, RVs, and kitchens. Used primarily by law enforcement, fire departments, EMS, and the racing industry across North America. Cold Fire offers Amerex equipment (converted 252 and 254 models), as well as imported equipment in smaller sizes.|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} efficiencies {{of some of}} {{the common}} <b>wetting</b> <b>agents</b> have been determined by measuring the surface tension of five-minute-old surfaces of the solutions using the ring method in a modified form. Aqueous solutions giving a surface tension of 37 dynes per cm. may be considered to have good wetting properties. It is found that wetting power is not necessarily associated with detergent and emulsifying properties. Salts greatly increase wetting power. Bivalent cations are more effective than univalent cations in increasing wetting power. A moderate degree of hardness in water employed in preparing solutions of <b>wetting</b> <b>agents</b> may be of advantage in the textile industry. The maximum bubble pressure method is shown to be unsuitable for the measurement of surface tension of solutions which show a variation with time. A rough idea of the order of wetting efficiencies of <b>wetting</b> <b>agents</b> can however be obtained by measuring the surface tension of a five-second-old surface by this method. ...|$|R

40|$|It is {{possible}} to obtain finely dispersed growth of tubercle bacilli by adding to the media {{in which they are}} cultivated certain non-ionic <b>wetting</b> <b>agents.</b> The polyoxyethylene esters of oleic acid (Atlas G- 2144), lauric acid (Arias G- 2124), sorbitan monooleate (Tween 80), sorbitan monostearate (Tween 60), sorbitan monopalmitate (Tween 40), and sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20), have proven especially effective in this respect. In addition to their wetting effect on the cell, certain of the water-dispersible esters just mentioned are capable of enhancing the growth of many strains of tubercle bacilli, probably by supplying them with long chain fatty acids in a non-toxic form available for metabolic utilization (3). Unfortunately, the ester linkage in these <b>wetting</b> <b>agents</b> is susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis by lipases, a fact which prohibits their use in media containing animal tissues or fluids rich in these enzymes. It is therefore desirable to find other types of <b>wetting</b> <b>agents</b> capable of promoting dispersed growth of tubercle bacilli and stable in the presence of animal tissues.
