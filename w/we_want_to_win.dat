2500|$|The Aviators' {{first move}} after {{relocating}} to San Diego was to hire David Macpherson as their coach. Macpherson immediately {{set to work}} recruiting players to fill the Aviators' roster {{while he was in}} Melbourne coaching Bob and Mike Bryan at the 2014 Australian Open. Since Macperson was the Bryan Brothers' coach, there was little doubt he was persuading them to play in WTT in San Diego. It didn't take long for Macpherson to convince the Bryans. However, the Texas Wild had the right to protect and draft them. Within a few days, on January 23, 2014, the Aviators acquired the Bryan Brothers in a trade with the Wild in exchange for undisclosed financial consideration. After the trade, Mike Bryan said, [...] "Growing up in California, we know that San Diego is a great tennis town and we are excited to play in front of the fans, family and friends."

Ironically, Midshipman, with whom Baffert had won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile, was taken off of him and given to another trainer the same month as he was given Pioneerof the Nile. Pioneerof the Nile's first start for Baffert came in the CashCall Futurity, on December 20th at Hollywood Park. He started as the 1.40 favorite against a field 11 other two-year-olds. He broke evenly, and settled in fifth, about eight lengths off the lead. He moved up to third before the far turn, and then unleashed a determined rally and battled with I <b>Want</b> Revenge <b>to</b> <b>win</b> by a head, with a final time of 1:41.95 for 1 1/16 miles. After the race, Baffert stated: “When he first got here I {{was trying to figure}} him out and was trying different things with him. When Bill Mott sent him he was in great shape. It was a pretty good Christmas gift there. When he makes the lead, he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> pull himself up. When he made the lead today, he started doing that, but as soon as that horse came to him, then he dug right back in again. <b>We</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>win</b> by further than that, but he made it close." [...] His jockey, Garrett Gomez, said: [...] "When they slowed down I caught up and then I shut him down and just sat there for a minute.

I {{did not have a}} very good start and struggled to get off the line and so I was third as David out-braked me round the outside. He was pulling away and I was concerned, because I could not go any faster. At that point he was definitely quicker than me. I was hoping he would pit early. He did and our strategy did the rest. David put me under pressure at the end, but I had looked after the last set of tyres so that I could have defended myself if I had needed to fight him off.

Alonso elaborated after the race, saying: [...] "I feel embarrassed when I'm racing sometimes because it's frustrating {{when you see the}} other cars making mistakes, going off the racing line, getting sideways. You look in the mirror on the straight to look for them and they are already side by side with you. The deficit we have on power is like another category." [...] Team CEO Ron Dennis in turn criticised Alonso for his outspoken words, saying: [...] "It doesn't show the professionalism I would like all our drivers to show." [...] Jenson Button had expounded the problems of the power unit on team radio as well, lamenting the fact that other cars had been able to pass him into 130R corner.

Ron Dennis admitted publicly to not having dealt with the question of Jenson Button's role in [...] earlier, following much debate over the driver's future. However, speculation ended when Button was confirmed as a McLaren driver for 2016 just five days later.

5000|$|Matt Ball {{suggests}} that a focus on purity and minutae will hinder the animal advocacy movement: Conversely, for every person convinced that veganism is overly-demanding by obsessing with an ever-increasing list of ingredients, we do worse than nothing: we turn someone away who {{could have made a}} real difference for animals if they hadnt met us. Currently {{the vast majority of people}} in our society have no problem eating the actual leg of a chicken. It is not surprising that many people dismiss vegans as unreasonable and irrational when our example includes interrogating waiters, not eating veggie burgers cooked on the same grill with meat, not taking photographs or using medicines, etc.Instead of spending our limited time and resources worrying about the margins (cane sugar, film, medicine, etc.), our focus should be on increasing our impact every day. Helping just one person change leads to hundreds fewer animals suffering in factory farms. By choosing to promote compassionate eating, every person we meet is a potential major victory....It is not enough to be a righteous vegan, or even a dedicated, knowledgeable vegan advocate. The animals dont need us to be right, they need us to be effective. In other words, <b>we</b> don’t <b>want</b> <b>to</b> just <b>win</b> an argument with a meat-eater, <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> open peoples hearts and minds to a more compassionate lifestyle.To do this, we have to be the opposite of the vegan stereotype. Regardless of the sorrow and outrage we rightly feel at the cruelties the animals suffer, we must strive to be what others <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be: joyful, respectful individuals, whose fulfilling lives inspire others. Only then can we do our best for the animals. Matt Ball [...] "How Vegan?", veganoutreach.org.|$|R
