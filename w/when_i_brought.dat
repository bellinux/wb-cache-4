2500|$|In {{the time}} of Nehemiah, after the Babylonian captivity, the Israelites celebrated Sukkot by making and {{dwelling}} in booths, a practice of which Nehemiah reports: [...] "the Israelites had not done so {{from the days of}} Joshua." [...] In a practice related to that of the Four Species, Nehemiah also reports that the Israelites found in the Law the commandment that they [...] "go out to the mountains and bring leafy branches of olive trees, pine trees, myrtles, palms and [...] leafy trees to make booths." [...] In [...] God told Moses to command the people: [...] "On the first day you shall take the product of hadar trees, branches of palm trees, boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook," [...] and [...] "You shall live in booths seven days; all citizens in Israel shall live in booths, in order that future generations may know that I made the Israelite people live in booths <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> them out of the land of Egypt." [...] The book of Numbers, however, indicates that while in the wilderness, the Israelites dwelt in tents. Some secular scholars consider [...] (the commandments regarding booths and the four species) to be an insertion by a late redactor.|$|E
2500|$|From 1953 to 1955 {{he went to}} sea as Commander Cruisers-Destroyers, Pacific, {{where his}} career was stalled {{temporarily}} by Secretary of the Navy Charles S. Thomas. Chief of Naval Operations Robert B. Carney was selecting members of an upcoming promotion board and picked Curts for his skill and contacts {{in the fields of}} electronics and communications. However, [...] "Mr. Thomas vetoed [...] <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> the slate in, and said that he didn't want him around Washington. I couldn't get from him any expression of reason as to this prejudice, but it was perfectly obvious that I couldn't bring [...] back. It was also perfectly obvious that I'd better not nominate him for three stars, which I had planned to do...But about a year later, I was looking for a replacement in the Second Fleet, and I brought in a nomination. Thomas said that he wasn't particularly impressed with the person I was suggesting and said {{it seemed to him that}} I'd do better if I put someone like [...] in." [...] Queried as to his change of heart, Thomas initially denied ever having vetoed Curts, then, when pressed by an incredulous Carney, [...] "finally said he couldn't understand why he had done it, except that somebody must have told him something." [...] Carney immediately nominated Curts for his third star.|$|E

50|$|Coldharbour was a liberty until 1608, <b>when</b> James <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> {{it within}} the {{jurisdiction}} of the City of London.|$|R
60|$|He {{had risen}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>brought</b> myself {{to look at}} him. And as I hope for heaven he took my emotion for pity of himself.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> had <b>brought</b> {{the horse}} some {{water in a}} bucket--and what a {{pleasure}} it was to water one's own horse!--Euphemia rushed {{into the house and}} got her hat and cloak, and we took a little drive.|$|R
60|$|So he {{was running}} on, for he himself had drunk more than his share, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> him back to my matter.|$|E
60|$|I {{put my arms}} round {{his neck}} and kissed him just as I had done on the day <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> my answer.|$|E
6000|$|The Captain, with Florence on his arm, {{nodded at}} the auditory, and seemed to say, 'Now he's coming out. This is what I meant <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Go {{and light}} a fire,' said the trader, 'and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have <b>brought</b> this oil <b>I</b> will cook some fish.' The woman grunted at him, island fashion. 'I {{am not a}} pig that you should grunt at me,' said he.|$|R
60|$|But I {{was gone}} {{but a little}} way <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>brought</b> {{suddenly}} to a standstill by another sound that in the hush of the garden, in the bright languor after sleep, went to my heart: {{it was as if}} a child were crying.|$|R
6000|$|... 'To be {{sure you}} are not my slave, {{and if you do}} not care to stop with me, you had better go home to your people,' said he. 'But in the mean time go and light the fire; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have <b>brought</b> this oil <b>I</b> will cook some fish.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Another, with a gun-shot wound {{through the}} cheek, {{asked for a}} looking-glass, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> one, {{regarded}} his swollen face with a dolorous expression, as he muttered-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, maister, {{there was}} a little one upon the edge of her plate <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> it out; and so it must have been in her few leaves of wintergreen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yer oughter {{seen how}} mad he looked, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> the hoss up. Lord, he'd a killed me, if he durs' to; and there I was a standin' as innercent and as humble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is {{a strange}} man, Sir Henry, and subject, I fancy, to {{changeable}} moods. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> was <b>brought</b> before him {{he was in a}} happy one, over the success he had gained; {{and it may be that}} he took a liking for me. At any rate, he fixed my ransom at a very small sum." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. I cannot ask Mrs. Coventry to {{recommend}} me, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have innocently <b>brought</b> {{so much trouble}} into her family; and Lady Sydney is gone, so I have no friend." ...|$|R
50|$|Industrial mining {{of copper}} at Coniston {{is said to}} have started <b>when</b> Elizabeth <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> over German miners to exploit the local deposits. During the English Civil War mining {{equipment}} was damaged, and as a result progress was slowed, and mining became dependent on fire cracking (not explosive) techniques. This mine {{was one of the first}} large scale mines to be dug.|$|R
6000|$|Mirabel shuddered. [...] "I am {{surrounded}} by dangers, whichever way I look," [...] he said. [...] "Do what I may, {{it turns out}} to be wrong. I was wrong, perhaps, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> Emily here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You don't {{remember}} us, I suppose, my man?" [...] Charlie began. [...] "The {{last time}} I saw you was <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> my stick {{down on your}} head, when you were listening outside a window at Lynnwood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{sorry you}} take it that way," [...] replied Pepper, with deprecatory {{spreading}} of his hands. He was quite cool and his little eyes held a singular gleam. [...] "You never kicked before <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> a stranger." ...|$|E
50|$|President and Editor P.T. Way {{started the}} {{publication}} as a four-page, 16-column daily {{version of his}} semi-weekly Henderson Gold Leaf on that date <b>when</b> World War <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> the need for up-to-date news of events abroad.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{had laid}} her head upon my shoulder, that night <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was summoned out--she had {{a fear of}} my going, though <b>I</b> had none--and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>brought</b> to the North Tower they found these upon my sleeve. 'You will leave me them? They can never help me to escape in the body, though they may in the spirit.' Those were the words I said. I {{remember}} them very well." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay," [...] said Amos, [...] "I saw him once, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>brought</b> {{before him}} with the others for trading on what he called French ground.

6000|$|Austin smiled. [...] "To {{take a risk}} I'm {{responsible}} for? I think not. I went sufficiently far <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> some of them here. Besides, it's {{comforting to}} remember you mayn't be right about the thing being contagious, after all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He hasn't gone yet," [...] the {{principal}} {{answered with a}} twinkle. [...] "He's waiting {{to see you in}} the managers' room, and I must confess to something of a plot <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> him in quietly to hear your lecture." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's so. Talking {{about it}} reminds me that I was puzzled by a smell I thought I ought to know <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> Clarke out of the tepee. I know now what it was; and the thing's significant. It was gasoline." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could no}} longer hold myself back, but ran to the seaside and out, from one rock to another, as far as I could go. It is a marvel I was not drowned; for <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>brought</b> to a stand at last, my legs shook under me, and my mouth was so dry, I must wet it with the sea-water before I was able to shout.|$|R
60|$|During two {{or three}} minutes I held my peace, the anger in my heart being so great that I could not think clearly, and then, realizing that the truth must be shortly known <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>brought</b> before the marquis, General Lafayette, as in my folly I {{believed}} I would be, I set about telling that which had best been told before I gave way to anger.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{have thought}} so; and I say it also,--to you. I owe him any {{reparation}} that I can make him; but I {{could not have}} lived with him.

I so often remember what you told me of him,--here; in this house, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>brought</b> you together. Alas, how sad it has been!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{believe if}} she hadn't known {{you were with}} her about my last year in Harvard--it would have been different. I could see, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> it in that {{you wanted me to}} go back, her mind was made up for you." ...|$|E
60|$|Twice {{was this}} {{manoeuvre}} repeated; {{and the third}} time <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> back my humiliated weapon, I found he had returned his own to the scabbard, and stood awaiting me with a face of some anger, and his hands clasped under his skirt.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's so. Talking {{about it}} reminds me that I was puzzled by a smell I thought I ought to know <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>brought</b> Clarke out of the tepee. I remembered what {{it was not long}} since and the thing's significant. It was gasoline." ...|$|E
60|$|Dr. Courtenay {{made his}} bow, his hat tucked under his arm. But he {{had much to}} learn of Miss Manners if he thought that even one who had been {{governor}} of the province could command her.

60|$|Dixon's {{prediction}} proved correct. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> was <b>brought</b> {{into court}} {{a second time}} {{there was still no}} news of Wilkins, and after further testimony of no importance the case was again adjourned. This time, however, bail was allowed, and Boone and Rancher Gordon stood surety for me. The latter was by no means rich, and had, like the rest of us, suffered severe losses of late. Dixon was the first to greet me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> went forth, somewhat moodily, a free man for the time being.|$|R
60|$|He went on at {{the same}} ridiculous rate; which soon {{convinced}} me, he was a thorough Rattle. However, as a Clerico, and consequently in this Country, a Man dangerous to disoblige, I invited him home to Dinner; where <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>brought</b> him, <b>I</b> found I had no way done an unacceptable thing; for my Landlady and her Daughter, seeing {{him to be a}} Clergyman, receiv'd him with a vast deal of Respect and Pleasure.|$|R
