She declares she is proud that she did what was necessary to save Leo's life, and she expresses contempt for the Communist ideology that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>let</b> him die. Andrei says he understands and accepts responsibility for making her suffer. When she leaves, Andrei confronts Syerov and insists that he use his influence to secure Leo's release. When Andrei gives his speech, he deviates from his prepared remarks to speak in favor of freedom and individualism.|$|E
25|$|Bill Cotton, the BBC's Head of Light Entertainment in the mid–1970s, {{said after}} the first series was {{produced}} that the show was {{a prime example of}} the BBC's relaxed attitude to trying new entertainment formats and encouraging new ideas. He said that when he read the first scripts he could see nothing funny in them, but, trusting that Cleese knew what he was doing, he gave the go-ahead. He said the commercial channels, with their emphasis on audience ratings, never <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>let</b> the programme get to the production stage {{on the basis of the}} scripts.|$|E

Realizing that Lazarus was now their prime suspect, the detectives informed their superiors of this and arranged to discreetly collect a voluntarily discarded DNA sample from her, knowing they would have to do so without getting a warrant, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>let</b> Lazarus know she was under investigation for the murder. While off-duty running errands, Lazarus discarded a cup from which she had been drinking, which police retrieved. A sample was taken from it, and it matched the DNA from the bite mark on Sherri Rasmussen.|$|E
25|$|Nimble, Capital and General Geddes reached Key West on 24 December and Florida and Thorn {{returned}} from Cuba the next day, their crews having been released unharmed. One of the Africans on Surprize died before reaching Key West, so 121 were unloaded there. Lt. Holden {{claimed that the}} Africans were under his protection because Guerrero had surrendered to him. The Collector of Customs for the port claimed custody of the Africans {{because they had been}} landed in American territory after being shipwrecked. The wreckers claimed salvage on Nimble for helping to get it off the reef and replace the rudder. Lt. Holden refused to submit to the arbitration procedure established by Florida territorial law, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>let</b> a panel of local residents, almost all of whom had a financial stake in wrecking, decide how much in salvage fees were due the wreckers. Nimble left Key West without the Africans, and the wreckers remained unpaid. Nimble delivered the 20 Cuban crewmen it was holding to Havana to be dealt with by the British-Spanish Mixed Commission Court that dealt with Spanish slave-runners caught near Cuba.|$|E
500|$|The Viking League and the Olympia Association {{were banned}} in Prussia in May 1926, {{when it was}} {{discovered}} they were planning a putsch against the government. Wessel, realizing that the League would not achieve its self-defined mission, resigned from it on 23 November 1926. Two weeks later, on 7 December, he joined the paramilitary Sturmabteilung ("Storm Detachment" [...] or SA) of Adolf Hitler's National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP or Nazi Party) Part of the attraction to Wessel was Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi Party's newly appointed Gauleiter (regional leader) of Berlin, about whom he would later say [...] "There was nothing [...] couldn't handle. The party comrades clung to him with great devotion. The SA <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>let</b> itself be cut to pieces for him. Goebbels [...] he was like Hitler himself.

500|$|The {{story was}} {{originally}} {{to have the}} player {{play the role of}} a nephew who had inherited a fortune from his aunt, to be spent only on the world's largest and most profitable theme park. The graphics were drawn and modelled using 3D Studio. Molyneux stated that each person takes about 200 bytes of memory, enough for them to have their own personality. The team travelled the world visiting theme parks and taking [...] notes, and sound effects were sampled from real parks. Molyneux explained that they were going for as much realism as possible. There was to be a feature where a microphone is placed on a visitor and so the player could hear what they were saying, and multiplayer support was dropped two weeks prior to release because of a deadline. Multiplayer mode <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>let</b> players send thugs to other parks.|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Zito {{struggled}} {{and posted}} the worst numbers {{of his career}} at the time. Zito went 2–3 with a 6.83 ERA {{in the month of}} April. On May 28, facing Cliff Lee, he threw eight shutout innings but received a no-decision in a 1–0 loss to the Cleveland Indians. He threw eight shutout innings of four-hit ball in a 5–0 victory over the Devil Rays on August 21. Oakland manager Ken Macha <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>let</b> him throw a complete game, but Zito said, [...] "I was worrying about being fresh for the next game. I didn't want to end up [...] 115–120 , so I took advantage of the situation and shut it down." [...] On September 12, he threw seven shutout innings and had 10 strikeouts, earning the win in a 1–0 victory over the Indians. For the season, he went 11–11 with a 4.48 ERA. That was his only year with the Athletics that his ERA was more than 4.00. He still finished 10th in the league in strikeouts with 163.|$|E
500|$|After {{winning the}} second race, Kenseth {{drove to the}} victory lane; earning $56,726 for the victory. Kenseth's victory gave his team Roush Fenway Racing its first win in the Gatorade Duels. Kenseth said, [...] "Jimmie Johnson gave me a huge push there and really worked nice for me the whole race. Without that push it never would've got there. Greg lost his {{drafting}} partner. We were able to separate him and the #78 [...] and we had such a big run that Greg {{was kind of a}} sitting duck." [...] Second-place finisher Smith stated while he would have preferred to win the race, he did not have any complaints, [...] "It’s good to know that we have a car capable of running up front." [...] Johnson, who finished third, said, [...] "It was an awesome race. We really had a shot to win that one. It was unfortunate there at the end that there were some lapped cars that were kind of mixed in with the leaders. It would have been nice if they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>let</b> us race there; at least from the white flag on." [...] It took 46 minutes and 23 seconds to complete the second race, and the margin of victory was 0.209 seconds.|$|E

Previous X-Men director Bryan Singer declared that The Last Stand [...] "isn't what I would have done" [...] and he was dissatisfied with the busy plot and excessive character deaths, but Singer still liked some parts of the movie, such as Ellen Page's casting – leading Singer to bring her back as Kitty Pryde in [...] – and the scenes with Leech, which he described as [...] "really sweet moments". Matthew Vaughn, who was attached as director before dropping out, criticized Ratner's direction: [...] "I could have done something with far more emotion and heart. I'm probably going to be told off for saying that, but I genuinely believe it." [...] While promoting his own installment of the franchise, 2011's , Vaughn would say regarding The Last Stand that [...] "I storyboarded the whole bloody film, did the script. My X3 would have been 40 minutes longer. They didn't let the emotions and the drama play in that film. It became wall-to-wall noise and drama. I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>let</b> it breathe and given far more dramatic elements to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to National Journal, {{during this}} period Rubio did not entirely adhere to doctrinaire {{conservative}} principles, and some colleagues described him as a centrist [...] "who sought out Democrats and groups that don’t typically align with the GOP". He co-sponsored legislation that <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>let</b> farm workers sue growers in state court if they were shortchanged on pay, and co-sponsored a bill for giving in-state tuition rates {{to the children of}} undocumented immigrants. [...] In the wake of the September 11 attacks, he voiced suspicion about expanding police detention powers, and helped defeat a GOP bill that would have required colleges to increase reporting to the state about foreign students.|$|E
2500|$|After his {{retirement}} from Somerset, Close {{continued to play}} at the Scarborough Festival against the touring international teams, first for T.N. Pearce's XI in 1978 and then for his own XI from 1982 to 1986. In 1986, aged 55, and playing his last-ever first-class innings, Close needed 10 runs to achieve a career-total 35,000 runs. With his score on 4 he glanced a ball down leg-side to the wicket-keeper and walked. Afterwards, the New Zealanders said that if they'd known how near he was to the landmark, they <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>let</b> him stay, but Close {{would have none of it}} – he was out, and that was that. When asked why he gave himself out he said: [...] "It's an honourable game and that's the way I was brought up." [...] Close's 786 first-class matches leave him 10th on the all-time list. Only four outfielders have taken more catches.|$|E

2500|$|On July 15, 2007, {{after the}} source's death, Novak said on Meet the Press that the unnamed senator was Thomas Eagleton. Political analyst Bob Shrum says that Eagleton {{would never have}} been {{selected}} as McGovern's running mate if it had been known at the time that Eagleton was the source of the quote: [...] "Boy, do I wish he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>let</b> you publish his name. Then he never would have been picked as vice president. Because the two things, the two things that happened to George McGovern—two of the things that happened to him— were the label you put on him, number one, and number two, the Eagleton disaster. We had a messy convention, but he could have, I think in the end, carried eight or 10 states, remained politically viable. And Eagleton {{was one of the great}} train wrecks of all time." ...|$|E
2500|$|A conference {{committee}} considered the final bill in early December 1970. Union leaders pressured {{members of the}} {{conference committee}} to place the standard-setting function in the Department of Labor rather than an independent board. In return, unions agreed to let an independent review commission have veto power over enforcement actions. Unions also agreed to removal of {{a provision in the}} legislation which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>let</b> the Secretary of Labor shut down plants or stop manufacturing procedures which put workers in [...] "imminent danger" [...] of harm. In exchange for a Republican proposal to establish an independent occupational health and safety research agency, Democrats won inclusion of the [...] "general duty" [...] clause and the right for union representatives to accompany a federal inspector during inspections. The conference committee bill passed both chambers on December 17, 1970, and President Nixon signed the bill on December 29, 1970. According to the New York Times, labor and environment activist Tony Mazzocchi was a [...] "principal force behind the legislation".|$|E
2500|$|The on-stage {{personalities of}} Groucho, Chico, and Harpo {{were said to}} have been based on their actual traits. Zeppo, on the other hand, was {{considered}} the funniest brother offstage, despite his straight stage roles. He was the youngest and had grown up watching his brothers, so he could fill in for and imitate any of the others when illness kept them from performing. [...] "He was so good as Captain Spaulding [...] that I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>let</b> him play the part indefinitely, if they had allowed me to smoke in the audience," [...] Groucho recalled. (Zeppo stood in for Groucho in the film version of Animal Crackers. Groucho was unavailable to film the scene in which the Beaugard painting is stolen, so the script was contrived to include a power failure, which allowed Zeppo to play the Spaulding part in near-darkness.) In December 1917 the Marx brothers were noted in an advertisement playing in a musical comedy act [...] "Home Again".|$|E
