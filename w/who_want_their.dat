500|$|The biggest {{studio in}} the low-budget field {{remained}} a leader in exploitation's growth. In 1973, American International gave a shot to young director Brian De Palma. Reviewing Sisters, Pauline Kael observed that its [...] "limp technique doesn't seem to matter to the people <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>their</b> gratuitous gore.... e can't get two people talking {{in order to make}} a simple expository point without its sounding like the drabbest Republic picture of 1938." [...] Many examples of the blaxploitation genre, featuring stereotype-filled stories revolving around drugs, violent crime, and prostitution, were the product of AIP. One of blaxploitation's biggest stars was Pam Grier, who began her film career with a bit part in Russ Meyer's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970). Several New World pictures followed, including The Big Doll House (1971) and The Big Bird Cage (1972), both directed by Jack Hill. Hill also directed her best-known performances, in two AIP blaxploitation films: Coffy (1973) and Foxy Brown (1974).|$|E
500|$|Melina Newman of HitFix {{thought that}} it looked like one of Carey's lowest-production budgets for a music video to date, but {{explained}} that it was not necessarily [...] "a bad thing", and that Carey looked [...] "adorable" [...] in a nurses outfit. She likened the use of a red and white color scheme for the video to a Target commercial. Anna Pickard commented that Carey and Minaj looked [...] "grumpier" [...] than what dolls usually do because [...] "their men are low-down dirty dogs who should henceforth get up out of Mimi and Nikki's faces". She compared the use of a red and white palette to Kylie Minogue's music video for [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head", Cheryl Fernandez-Versini's [...] "Fight for This Love" [...] and Lady Gaga's [...] "Bad Romance", and that it appeared to be a [...] "go-to device for directors <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>their</b> pop video to pop visually, without the need for too much pesky plot to worry about". Chris Ryan thought that Minaj outshined Carey in the video. In a review of Minaj's ten best videos in December 2014, Rolling Stone ranked the video for [...] "Up Out My Face" [...] at number eight, and wrote that Carey and Minaj had [...] "great on-camera chemistry".|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the startups, the growth of exploitation in the 1970s also involved the leading studio in the low-budget field. In 1973, American International gave a shot to director Brian De Palma, whose previous movie, a Warner Bros. comedy, had flopped badly. Reviewing Sisters, De Palma's first horror film, New Yorker critic Pauline Kael observed that its [...] "limp technique doesn't seem to matter to the people <b>who</b> <b>want</b> <b>their</b> gratuitous gore. The movie supplies it, but why is there so much gratuitous dumbness too?... e can't get two people talking {{in order to make}} a simple expository point without its sounding like the drabbest Republic picture of 1938." [...] Many examples of the so-called blaxploitation genre of the early and middle part of the decade, featuring stereotype-filled stories revolving around drugs, violent crime, and prostitution, were the product of AIP.

Grier has the distinction of starring in the first widely distributed movie to climax with a castration scene.|$|E
