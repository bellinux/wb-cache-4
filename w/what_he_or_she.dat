5|$|In 2008, {{the annual}} salary for {{entry-level}} ministers was $1,924,300. In {{view of the}} worsening economic crisis in 2008–2009, as of January 2009 the Prime Minister's salary was cut to $3.04 million, while the pay of ministerial-grade officers was reduced by 18% to $1.57 million. In November 2009 the Public Service Division announced that pay increments would be deferred {{for a second time}} in 2010 because of the uncertain economic recovery. A minister's 2009 salary of $1,494,700 per year was therefore 22% lower than <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> received in 2008.|$|E

50|$|Motivated {{processing}} {{usually involves}} specific and targeted search strategies with a direct informational goal in mind. This strategy also involves little influence from mood, {{as the individual}} in question will have a fairly clear idea of <b>what</b> information <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> needs (although it is higher on the continuum than direct access processing).|$|R
5000|$|The plot is thus {{designed}} to appear open-ended {{with the development}} of the story entirely dependent on what the player decides to talk or ask about <b>or</b> <b>what</b> actions <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> chooses to perform. [...] Thus the original author and the player share {{in the creation of a}} work of fiction.|$|R
5|$|Feminist economists Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum {{created the}} human {{capabilities}} approach {{as an alternative}} way to assess economic success rooted in the ideas of welfare economics {{and focused on the}} individual's potential to do and be <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> may choose to value. Unlike traditional economic measures of success, focused on GDP, utility, income, assets or other monetary measures, the capabilities approach focuses on what individuals are able to do. This approach emphasizes processes as well as outcomes, and draws attention to cultural, social and material dynamics of well-being. Martha Nussbaum, expanded on the model with a more complete list of central capabilities including life, health, bodily integrity, thought, and more. In recent years, the capabilities approach has influenced the creation of new models including the UN's Human Development Index (HDI).|$|E
5|$|Our perceptual {{experiences}} {{depend on}} stimuli that arrive at our various sensory organs from the external world, and these stimuli cause {{changes in our}} mental states, ultimately causing us to feel a sensation, which may be pleasant or unpleasant. Someone's desire for a slice of pizza, for example, will tend to cause that person to move his or her body in a specific manner and in a specific direction to obtain <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> wants. The question, then, is {{how it can be}} possible for conscious experiences to arise out of a lump of gray matter endowed with nothing but electrochemical properties.|$|E

25|$|Sex {{education}} may be taught informally, {{such as when}} someone receives information from {{a conversation with a}} parent, friend, religious leader, or through the media. It may also be delivered through sex self-help authors, magazine advice columnists, sex columnists, or sex education web sites. Formal sex education occurs when schools or health care providers offer sex education. Slyer stated that sex education teaches the young person <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> should know for his or her personal conduct and relationship with others. Gruenberg also stated that sex education is necessary to prepare the young for the task ahead. According to him, officials generally agree that some kind of planned sex education is necessary.|$|E
500|$|Spike Lee {{first learned}} of the novel in 2004 and {{contacted}} McBride about making a film adaptation. [...] He felt that McBride was the perfect person to write the screenplay, believing that his novel {{would serve as a}} guide. Commenting on the difficult process of adapting his book into a screenplay, McBride stated, “As a novelist, you tend to think internally. You can guide what the character says and you can explore <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is thinking. Movies don't have time to explain. You have to get right to the muscle.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The other {{important}} element of natural justice is fair hearing (audi alteram partem, or [...] "hear the other side").

500|$|In May 1928, the KCA {{launched}} a Kikuyu-language magazine, Muĩgwithania (roughly translated as [...] "The Reconciler" [...] or [...] "The Unifier"), {{in which it}} published news, articles, and homilies. Its purpose was to help unify the Kikuyu and {{to raise funds for}} the KCA. Kenyatta, now described as Secretary of the KCA, was listed as the publication's editor, although Murray-Brown suggested that he was not the guiding hand behind it and that his duties were largely confined to translating things into Kikuyu. Kenyatta's approach to campaigning was cautious; he was aware that Thuku had been exiled for his activism. In Muĩgwithania, he expressed support for the churches, district commissioners, and chiefs. He also praised the British Empire, stating that: [...] "The first thing [...] is that all people are governed justly, big or small – equally. The second thing is that nobody is regarded as a slave, everyone is free to do <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> likes without being hindered." ...|$|E
500|$|Lessing {{said she}} was {{inspired}} to write The Good Terrorist by the IRA bombing of the Harrods department store in London in 1983. She recalled, [...] "the media reported it to sound {{as if it was}} the work of amateurs. I started to think, what kind of amateurs could they be?" [...] and realised [...] "how easy it would be for a kid, not really knowing <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> was doing, to drift into a terrorist group." [...] Lessing already had Alice in mind as the central character: [...] "I know several people like Alice—this mixture of... maternal caring,... and who can contemplate killing large numbers of people without a moment's bother." [...] She described Alice as [...] "quietly comic" [...] because she is so full of contradictions. She {{said she was}} surprised how some of the characters (other than Jasper, Alice's love interest) developed, such as the pill-popping and fragile Faye, {{who turned out to be}} a [...] "destroyed person".|$|E
2500|$|The {{forms of}} Chola bronzes are very plastic. They are devoid of {{intricate}} ornaments and designs {{in comparison with}} the subsequent bronzes of the Vijayanagar and Nayaka period.

By means of [...] the facial expressions, the gestures or mudras the overall body posture and other accompanying bronzes we can imagine the surroundings and the religious context of the figure of the god or goddess; what instrument or weapon he or she is holding; <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is leaning on; and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> is doing or about to do.|$|E

Dancing with a regular partner is an opportunity to play and practice difficult moves, such as aerials (which are dangerous without regular practice).|$|R
