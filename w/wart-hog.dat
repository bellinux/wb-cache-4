60|$|She {{therefore}} seated {{herself on}} a rock, and contemplated the ocean. Wilton {{walked up and}} down. Neither showed any disposition to exercise that gift of speech which places Man {{in a class of}} his own, above the ox, the ass, the common <b>wart-hog,</b> {{and the rest of the}} lower animals. It was only when a wave swished over the base of her rock that Mary broke the silence.|$|E
50|$|Wonder <b>Wart-Hog's</b> love {{interest}} is Lois Lamebrain, an analog of Lois Lane.|$|R
50|$|Wonder <b>Wart-Hog's</b> adventures were {{serialized}} in {{comic strip}} form in many underground newspapers and college newspapers from the mid-1960s through 1977.|$|R
60|$|Buffaloes {{were also}} {{seen in the}} grassy glades, but it proved {{difficult}} to come within range of them; also <b>wart-hogs,</b> and three different kinds of antelope.|$|R
60|$|In the <b>wart-hog</b> (Phacochœrus æthiopicus, fig. 65) the tusks in {{the upper}} jaw of the male curve upwards during the prime of life, and from being pointed, serve as {{formidable}} weapons. The tusks in the lower jaw are sharper than those {{in the upper}}, but from their shortness it seems hardly possible that they can be used as weapons of attack. They must, however, greatly strengthen those in the upper jaw, from being ground so as to fit closely against their bases. Neither the upper nor the lower tusks appear to have been specially modified to act as guards, though, no doubt, they are thus used to a certain extent. But the <b>wart-hog</b> is not destitute of other special means of protection, for there exists, {{on each side of the}} face, beneath the eyes, a rather stiff, yet flexible, cartilaginous, oblong pad (fig. 65), which projects two or three inches outwards; and it appeared to Mr. Bartlett and myself, when viewing the living animal, that these pads, when struck from beneath by the tusks of an opponent, would be turned upwards, and would thus protect in an admirable manner the somewhat prominent eyes. These boars, as I may add on the authority of Mr. Bartlett, when fighting together, stand directly face to face.|$|E
60|$|Lastly, the African river-hog (Potamochoerus penicillatus) {{has a hard}} {{cartilaginous}} knob on {{each side}} of the face beneath the eyes, which answers to the flexible pad of the wart-hog; it has also two bony prominences on the upper jaw above the nostrils. A boar of this species in the Zoological Gardens recently broke into the cage of the <b>wart-hog.</b> They fought all night-long, and were found in the morning much exhausted, but not seriously wounded. It is a significant fact, as shewing the purpose of the above-described projections and excrescences, that these were covered with blood, and were scored and abraded in an extraordinary manner.|$|E
5000|$|His secret {{identity}} is the mild-mannered reporter Philbert DeSanex, {{who works for}} the Muthalode Morning Mungpie. Instead of being a human disguised as a rubber-masked monster, Wonder <b>Wart-Hog</b> is a pig-faced monster who disguises himself as a rubber-faced human. (Occasionally, however, Shelton has depicted Wonder <b>Wart-Hog</b> and DeSanex as two distinct individuals, with Wonder <b>Wart-Hog</b> residing inside the reporter's body.) ...|$|E
50|$|Three {{stories about}} Philbert Desanex from the trade {{paperback}} collection were released as a stand-alone comic, Philbert Desanex' Dreams (Rip Off Press, 1993). The stories center almost entirely around Wonder <b>Wart-Hog's</b> alter ego, {{with only a}} brief appearance by the Hog of Steel.|$|R
60|$|Here {{again we}} have a {{resemblance}} to the <b>Wart-hogs</b> of Africa, whose upper canines grow outwards and curve up so as to form a transition from the usual mode of growth {{to that of the}} Babirusa. In other respects there seems no affinity between these animals, and the Babirusa stands completely isolated, having no resemblance to the pigs of any other part of the world. It is found all over Celebes and in the Sula islands, and also in Bourn, the only spot beyond the Celebes group to which it extends; and which island also shows some affinity to the Sula islands in its birds, indicating perhaps, a closer connection between them at some former period than now exists.|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{persistent}} infection {{was established}} in 100 % of pigs (n = 19) experimentally infected with African swine fever virus (ASFV). Viral DNA was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear leukocytes (PBML) at greater than 500 days postinfection by a PCR assay. Infectious virus was not, however, isolated from the same PBML samples. In cell fractionation studies of PBML, monocytes/macrophages were found to harbor viral DNA during the persistent phase of infection. This result indicates that monocytes/macrophages are persistently infected with ASFV and that ASFV-swine monocyte/macrophage interactions can result in either lytic or persistent infection. African swine fever virus (ASFV) is a large icosahedral DNA virus that infects soft ticks of the Ornithodoros genus {{and members of the}} Suidae family, including domestic pigs, <b>wart-hogs,</b> and bush pigs. ASFV, currently the sole member of an unnamed family of animal viruses, is the causative agent of African swine fever, a significant disease threat for domestic swine (8, 29). African swine fever occurs in several disease forms, rangin...|$|R
50|$|That same year, Millar Publishing Company, who {{had been}} {{publishing}} regular Wonder <b>Wart-Hog</b> stories since 1966, published two issues of Wonder <b>Wart-Hog.</b> 140,000 copies of each were printed, but distributors did not pick up the magazine, and only 40,000 of each were sold.|$|E
5000|$|The {{idea for}} Wonder <b>Wart-Hog</b> came to Gilbert Shelton in 1961, {{while he was}} living in New York. The {{following}} year, Shelton moved back to Texas to enroll in graduate school and get student deferment from the draft. He then collaborated with Tony Bell. The first two Wonder <b>Wart-Hog</b> stories appeared in Bacchanal, a short-lived college humor magazine produced by former staffers at UT's humor magazine The Texas Ranger, in the spring of 1962. Shelton then became editor of The Texas Ranger (where he had first published work in 1959) and published more Wonder <b>Wart-Hog</b> stories. The character attracted the attention of Mademoiselle, which wrote about Wonder <b>Wart-Hog</b> in the August 1962 [...] "College" [...] issue. Harvey Kurtzman's Help! also published a few of the Hog of Steel's adventures in 1964-1965.|$|E
5000|$|Pete Millar's DRAG Cartoons {{magazine}} {{published a}} Wonder <b>Wart-Hog</b> strip {{in the early}} 1960s. The first ongoing publication of Wonder <b>Wart-Hog</b> was in DRAG Cartoons issues 25-49 (1966-1968); several of those also featured another Shelton strip called Bull O'Fuzz. Issue #45 boasted several strips by Shelton, including a parody of West Side Story called [...] "Vice Squad Story". Many of these strips were reprinted in 1968, when Millar Publishing Company released two issues of Wonder <b>Wart-Hog</b> Quarterly. 140,000 copies of each were printed, but distributors did not pick up the magazine and only 40,000 of each were sold.|$|E

6000|$|None {{of these}} three animals last {{mentioned}} has any close allies elsewhere, and their presence in Celebes may be considered the crucial fact which must give us the clue to the past history of the island. Let us then see what they teach us. The ape is apparently somewhat intermediate between the great baboons of Africa and the short-tailed macaques of Asia, but its cranium shows a nearer approach to the former group, in its flat projecting muzzle, large superciliary crests, and maxillary ridges. The anoa, though anatomically allied to the buffaloes, externally more resembles the bovine antelopes of Africa; while the babirusa is altogether unlike any other living member of the swine family, the canines of the upper jaws growing directly upwards like horns, forming a spiral curve over the eyes, instead of downwards, as in all other mammalia. An approach to this peculiarity is made by the African <b>wart-hogs,</b> in which the upper tusk grows out laterally and then curves up; but these animals are not otherwise closely allied to the babirusa. {457} ...|$|R

50|$|Directly after graduation, Shelton {{moved to}} New York City {{and got a}} job editing {{automotive}} magazines, where he would sneak his drawings into print. Early work of his was published in Warren Publishing's Help! The idea for the character of Wonder <b>Wart-Hog,</b> a porcine parody of Superman, came to him in 1961. The following year, Shelton moved back to Texas to enroll in graduate school and get a student deferment from the draft.

50|$|Feds 'N' Heads is an {{underground}} comic book, created and self-published by Gilbert Shelton, which introduced {{the world to}} the Shelton characters Wonder <b>Wart-Hog</b> and The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. In the spring of 1968, cartoonist Gilbert Shelton, already somewhat known in college humor and underground comix circles for his Superman parody Wonder <b>Wart-Hog,</b> self-published a 28-page one-shot, Feds 'N' Heads Comics, much of the material of which had previously appeared in the Austin, Texas, underground paper The Rag.
