This leaves the stadium's future clouded in uncertainty. Recent occurrences have indicated that Malmö Stadion might continue to be used as an athletics arena, as MAI intends to revive the MAI Gala.

She has a rather ditsy personality, and her large bust size is often used as a comical element in the story. She is close friends with Rika Minami, who works as a sniper on the prefectural police Special Assault Team, and she even house-sits for her. The group uses Rika's apartment to rest after they escape the high school. Although she is the oldest of the group at age 27, she is emotionally fragile and does not know <b>what</b> <b>will</b> <b>become</b> <b>of</b> her life. She reveals to Takashi Komuro that she is just a temporary school nurse, and that she is still taking classes and training. Despite this, Marikawa has put her knowledge to good use, and even brings Kohta Hirano to his senses after he had mercy-killed Asami Nakaoka. As the only adult in the group, she drives the bus out of the school, and then Rika's military-grade Humvee.|$|E
