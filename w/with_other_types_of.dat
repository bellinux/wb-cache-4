5|$|DKA happens {{most often}} in those with type 1 {{diabetes}}, but can also occur in those <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> diabetes under certain circumstances. Triggers may include infection, not taking insulin correctly, stroke, and certain medications such as steroids. DKA results from a shortage of insulin; in response the body switches to burning fatty acids which produces acidic ketone bodies. DKA is typically diagnosed when testing finds high blood sugar, low blood pH, and ketoacids in either the blood or urine.|$|E

The Von Steins were experienced <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> museum conservation work, {{but had never}} restored carousel animals. Because of the animals' poor condition, no {{attempt was made to}} restore them to their original paintwork; instead, the restorers were allowed to use their judgment on color choices and other decorations. The museum's only requirements were that they use reasonably natural decorative schemes and no high-gloss paint.|$|E
5|$|Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) allows data packets to be {{used for}} {{synchronous}} voice communications. The data packets are marked as voice type packets and can be prioritized by the network administrators so that the real-time, synchronous conversation is less subject to contention <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> data traffic which can be delayed (i.e. file transfer or email) or buffered in advance (i.e. audio and video) without detriment. That prioritization is fine when the network has sufficient capacity for all the VoIP calls taking {{place at the same time}} and the network is enabled for prioritization i.e. a private corporate style network, but the Internet is not generally managed in this way and so there can be a big difference in the quality of VoIP calls over a private network and over the public Internet.|$|E

5|$|Men with SCI {{rank the}} ability to father {{children}} among their highest concerns relating to sexuality. Male fertility is reduced after SCI, due {{to a combination of}} problems with erections, ejaculation, and quality of the semen. As <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> sexual response, ejaculation can be psychogenic or reflexogenic, and the level of injury affects a man's ability to experience each type. As many as 95% of men with SCI have problems with ejaculation (anejaculation), possibly due to impaired coordination of input from different parts of the nervous system. Erection, orgasm, and ejaculation can each occur independently, although {{the ability to}} ejaculate seems linked {{to the quality of the}} erection, and the ability to orgasm is linked to the ejaculation facility. Even men with complete injuries may be able to ejaculate, because other nerves involved in ejaculation can effect the response without input from the spinal cord. In general, the higher the level of injury, the more physical stimulation the man needs to ejaculate. Conversely, premature or spontaneous ejaculation can be a problem for men with injuries at levels T12–L1. It can be severe enough that ejaculation is provoked by thinking a sexual thought, or for no reason at all, and is not accompanied by orgasm.|$|E
5|$|The protagonist {{encounters}} the antagonistic team, Team Galactic, {{early in}} the game, {{when he or she}} must save Professor Rowan from some of their thugs; however, their motives are unclear until later. The protagonist encounters the Team twice (when it takes over a wind farm and when it sets up a base in Eterna City) before it takes over Sinnoh's three lakes in an attempt to capture the Mirage Pokémon (Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit). Shortly after the player earns his or her seventh Gym Badge, Team Galactic captures the Mirage Pokémon and imprisons them inside the science laboratory of the Team Galactic Headquarters Building, where its members extract crystals from the Pokémon to create the Red Chain, an object that can control the legendary Pokémon Palkia (in Pearl) or Dialga (in Diamond) (both in Pokémon Platinum, though Giratina appears after this). After releasing the trio, the protagonist is able to access Spear Pillar, an ancient ruin atop Mt. Coronet, where the leader of Team Galactic awakens Dialga or Palkia. The legendary Pokémon's powers begin to overwhelm Sinnoh, causing the newly free Uxie, Azelf, and Mesprit to attempt to stop it. The player then battles Palkia/Dialga; after defeating or capturing the Pokémon, Sinnoh returns to normal. After this, the player will continue, eventually battling the Sinnoh Region Pokémon League's Elite Four: Aaron, Bertha, Flint, and Lucian. After defeating all four members, the player will battle the Sinnoh League champion, a woman named Cynthia, who had appeared before in the game. If the protagonist beats Cynthia, he or she is the new Sinnoh League champion, beating the game. After the player beats the game, there is a new island to explore that is filled <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> Pokémon. His or her old friend, who challenged him or her to battles multiple times before, will be waiting for him or her here. The old friend will challenge the player to another battle. On this island, there are also stores and a tournament center.|$|E

40|$|Background: Electrical burns are {{associated}} with complications and may aggravate burned patients. Aim: To evaluate the effect of electrical burns in mortality and length of stay in a critical care unit for burn patients. Material and Methods: Retrospective analysis of medical records of 182 patients aged 15 to 90 years, admitted to an intensive care unit for burn patients. The length of stay and mortality of 14 patients that suffered electric burns was compared with the features <b>of</b> 168 patients <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> burns. Results: Patients with electrical burns were younger, had a lower percentage of total body surface burnt and had a lower frequency of inhalatory injuries than their counterparts <b>with</b> <b>other</b> <b>type</b> <b>of</b> burns. Mortality rate among patients <b>with</b> electric or <b>other</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> burns was similar (three and 49 patients, respectively). Intensive care unit stay was also similar. A multivariate analysis showed that high voltage electric burns were an independent risk factor for death with an odds ratio of 12 (95 % confidence intervals 1. 8 - 79. 4). Conclusions: High voltage electric burns are an independent risk factor for death among burn patients...|$|R
