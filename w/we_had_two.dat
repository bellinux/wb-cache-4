500|$|The episode {{features}} the final regular appearance by Duncan Kane (played by Teddy Dunn), after his character was written off the series. Duncan would later cameo {{in the season}} two finale, [...] "Not Pictured". Thomas attributed Duncan's departure {{to the lack of}} fan interest in Veronica and Duncan's relationship and the more enthusiastic reception to the Veronica-Logan relationship, stating that [...] "You know, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> romantic possibilities for Veronica. One sort of dominated the fans' interest. And it became clear that one suitor won out." ...|$|E

Garfield recalled, [...] "I think all of [...] were in our backyards. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> or three scenes with me talking over the fence, and there was one with us riding together on a motorcycle that we never got to shoot." [...] By mid-June, Mary Jane was cut from the film, with director Webb explaining it as [...] "a creative decision to streamline the story and focus on Peter and Gwen and their relationship." ...|$|E
500|$|Digital Domain, Scanline VFX and Trixter each {{worked on}} {{separate}} shots featuring the Mark 42 armor, working with different digital models. The studios shared {{some of their}} files to ensure consistency between the shots. For the Mark 42 and Iron Patriot armors, Legacy Effects constructed partial suits that were worn on set. Townsend explained that [...] "Invariably we'd shoot a soft-suit with Robert then we'd also put tracking markers on his trousers. He would also wear lifts in his shoes or be up in a box so he'd be the correct height—Iron Man is 6'5". During shooting we used multiple witness cams, Canon C300s, and <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> or three running whenever there was an Iron Man or Extremis character." [...] The artists studied time lapse photography of decaying fruit and vegetables and actual phenomena such as the aurora borealis as reference for {{the effect of the}} glowing Extremis characters.|$|E

500|$|Penn's captain, Bill Hollenback, said: “This fellow Schulz is {{a monster}} {{in size and}} a perfect athlete. [...] He is both wonderfully agile and fast {{for a man of}} his size. [...] In our game with Michigan, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> men {{instructed}} to play against Schulz and at times three and four were opposed to him. [...] For some time, he handed out as much as we passed to him in the roughing end of the game. [...] He was here, there and everywhere. He did most of the tackling. [...] He broke up innumerable plays. [...] He was the star of the contest until the continued battering of our men injured him {{to such an extent that}} he had to retire. [...] The rest was easy". [...] Coach Yost said of Schulz's performance: [...] "He gave the greatest one-man exhibition of courage I ever saw on a football field".|$|E
500|$|At {{this stage}} Kneale was working {{primarily}} in Independent Television, having written the play Murrain (screened in the anthology series Against The Crowd, 1975) and the anthology series Beasts (1976) for ATV. In May 1977, Euston Films—a subsidiary of Thames Television {{best known for}} The Sweeney (1975–1978)—announced that they had picked up Kneale's unmade Quatermass scripts. This new production, known either as Quatermass or Quatermass IV, would consist of a four-part serial to be broadcast by ITV which would be recut as a 100-minute film, titled The Quatermass Conclusion, for release in North America and Europe. Kneale was dubious about having to craft both a television serial version and a film version of his tale, feeling that [...] "in the end <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> versions, neither {{of which was the}} right length for the story". During the rewrites, Kneale transplanted the action at the conclusion of part three from Stonehenge to the more easily available Wembley Stadium. When asked about what differences there were between the Euston Films version and the version originally envisaged for the BBC, Kneale remarked that [...] "the BBC version would have been much more in the studio, whereas the Euston Films version was entirely shot on 35mm film {{with a great deal of}} it outside. Much more lavish than either the BBC or I had contemplated".|$|E
500|$|Sergeant Major Avery Junior Johnson is a Marine {{who leads}} human forces against Covenant and Flood assaults {{throughout}} the Halo series. The character is voiced by David Scully. Johnson {{and a few}} other Marines survive the destruction of Installation 04 and are rescued by Cortana and the Master Chief during the novel [...] Johnson plays a much larger role in Halo 2, joining forces with the Arbiter to stop Tartarus from activating Installation 05. In Halo 2, he is awarded the Colonial Cross for his heroic actions at Installation 04, and leads UNSC forces to drive the Covenant from New Mombasa, Kenya after the Covenant take the city during the events of the game. At this portion, Johnson states [...] "When I joined the Corps, we didn't have no fancy-schmanzy tanks. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> sticks, and a rock for the whole platoon - and we had to share the rock," [...] implying that Johnson joined during the Stone Age. In , Johnson is seen asking an Engineer what the Covenant want in New Mombasa and the Engineer lights Johnson's cigar. In Halo 3, the Forerunner construct 343 Guilty Spark kills him when Johnson tries to activate the incomplete Halo at the Ark. Johnson is the sole character featured in The Halo Graphic Novel story, [...] "Breaking Quarantine," [...] which details Johnson's escape from the Flood in Halo: Combat Evolved, and a main character in the 2007 novel [...]|$|E

2500|$|All {{structures}} on Gorodomlya island were renovated and living conditions were quite decent for those times. At least married specialists received separate two- or three-room apartments. Visiting the island, I could only envy them, because I {{and my family}} lived in Moscow in a shared four-room apartment, where <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> rooms of [...] combined.

2500|$|The Beatles {{assembled}} at Twickenham Film Studios on 2 January 1969, {{accompanied by}} the film crew, and began rehearsing. Cameraman Les Parrott recalled: [...] "My brief {{on the first day}} was to 'shoot The Beatles.' The sound crew instructions were to roll/record from the moment the first Beatle appeared and to record sound all day until the last one left. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> cameras and just about did the same thing." [...] The cold and austere conditions at Twickenham, along with nearly constant filming and sessions starting much earlier than the Beatles' preferred schedule, constrained creativity and exacerbated tensions within the group. The sessions were later described by Harrison as [...] "the low of all-time" [...] and by Lennon as [...] "hell... the most miserable sessions on earth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ronaldo {{took part}} in the tournament despite {{suffering}} from patellar tendinitis and a related thigh injury, potentially risking his career. Ronaldo later commented: [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> or three Cristiano Ronaldos in the team I would feel more comfortable. But we don't." [...] Despite ongoing doubts over his fitness, being forced to abort practice twice, Ronaldo played the full 90 minutes of the opening match against Germany, though he was unable to prevent a 4–0 defeat. After assisting an injury-time 2–2 equaliser against the United States, he scored a late match-winning goal in a 2–1 victory over Ghana. His 50th international goal made him the first Portuguese to play and score in three World Cups. Portugal were eliminated from the tournament {{at the close of the}} group stage on goal difference.|$|E

However, conflicting reports state that Killing Joke did {{file a lawsuit}} {{but that it was}} either thrown out of court, or that it was dropped following Cobain's death. Geordie Walker, Killing Joke's guitar player, said that the band was [...] "very pissed off about that, but it's obvious to everyone. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> separate musicologists' reports saying it was. Our publisher sent their publisher a letter saying it was and they went 'Boo, never heard of ya!', but the hysterical thing about Nirvana saying they'd never heard of us was that they'd already sent us a Christmas card!" ...|$|E
2500|$|All of {{a sudden}} <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> Australian teams on one tour... I {{certainly}} felt excluded... At one stage in England I was waiting in a bar for my teammates to come downstairs, but because everyone was up the street with Packer, they never came... I was certainly disappointed to be left out. At that stage I think I had played nine Tests and was averaging 40 and you had {{other people who were}} barely Shield cricketers being called up by Packer. I didn't know the reasons why those guys were in it and I wasn't. That is always a question I will wonder about. I certainly kept being mates with Hookesy... It was a strange feeling. There were times when we were there to play for Australia and some blokes were off at a meeting about something else. There were times when there were arguments in the bar that got a lot louder than what they should have been.|$|E
2500|$|In another {{interview}} Cedric elaborated on the kidnapping/vanishing themes, saying [...] "Lyrically, I {{wanted to}} incorporate elements of traditional songs. So {{that it would}} sound like our world had these handed down, traditional songs that were to do with real random vanishings and kidnappings. That {{is a big part}} of Latin culture. People get kidnapped all the time. I wanted to cover everything. Right from the exhilarating feeling you get when you put the ransom note down, the adrenaline rush when you realise a loved one has been taken from you, followed by that bleak, dismal area of not knowing what to do. Especially if you don't come from money. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> friends that we knew from Texas who just randomly vanished. We've never known whether they just took off or if they met foul play. I found it an interesting subject matter to tackle. I wanted the lyrics to instil that bleak feeling you can get from living somewhere like El Paso. Even though I haven't lived at home for ages, it's still with me. The stories that come from across the border still hit home really hard. I just wanted to have a soundtrack for that really." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ultimately, U2 {{felt that}} Pop {{had not been}} {{completed}} to their satisfaction. The Edge described the finished album as [...] "a compromise project by the end. It was a crazy period trying to mix everything and finish recording and having production meetings about the upcoming tour... If you can't mix something, it generally means there's something wrong with it..." [...] Mullen said, [...] "If <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>two</b> or three more months to work, {{we would have had}} a very different record. I would like someday to rework those songs and give them the attention and time that they deserve." [...] McGuinness disagrees that the band did not have enough time, saying, [...] "It got an awful lot of time, actually. I think it suffered from too many cooks [...] There were so many people with a hand in that record it wasn't surprising to me that it didn't come through as clearly as it might have done... It was also the first time I started to think that technology was getting out of control." [...] The band ended up re-working and re-recording many songs for the album's singles, {{as well as for the}} band's 2002 compilation The Best of 1990-2000.|$|E
