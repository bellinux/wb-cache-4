40|$|Temperature-sensitive mutants of {{adenovirus}} type 5 {{have been}} examined by various serological techniques. Cells infected with these mutants at the non-per-missive temperature responded in different ways and four main serological groups could be assigned {{on the basis of}} complement fixation tests, namely group I, <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> no major differences in the production of capsid antigens; Group II, <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> no production of any of the capsid antigens; Group III, <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> no production of fibre antigen; and Group IV, <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> limited production of hexon antigen and variable yields of penton base antigen. Fluorescent antibody tests further subdivided the latter group into mutants <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> no production of hexon antigen and those <b>which</b> <b>showed</b> production of hexon antigen, although with an abnormal distribution. These results were in good agreement with the complementation data although within most of the serological groupings there was more than one complementation group...|$|R

5|$|A {{major element}} of {{gameplay}} is the optional discovery and collection of manuscript pages from Alan Wake's latest novel—Departure. Although Wake does not remember writing this book, its storyline {{seems to be}} becoming real around him. These readable manuscript pages are scattered around the game world, out of chronological order; they often describe scenes {{that have yet to}} occur and act as warning and instructions for proceeding through upcoming challenges. Other optional collectibles include coffee thermoses scattered around the game world (100 in all), as well as discovering television sets <b>which</b> <b>show</b> different episodes of the fictional Night Springs series, radios airing talk and music from Bright Falls' local radio station, and textual signs around the town. The radio shows and signs provide {{a deeper understanding of the}} town's history and culture. The game's downloadable content episodes introduce other collectibles such as alarm clocks.|$|E
5|$|A {{specimen}} of Pinacosaurus preserves large paraglossalia (triangular bones or cartilages {{located in the}} tongue) <b>which</b> <b>show</b> signs of muscular stress, and it is {{thought this was a}} common feature of ankylosaurs. The researchers who examined the specimen suggested that ankylosaurs relied heavily on muscular tongues and hyobranchia (tongue bones) when feeding, since their teeth were fairly small and were replaced at a relatively slow rate. Some modern salamanders have similar tongue bones, and use prehensile tongues to pick up food. Based on the broadness of the ribcage, Ankylosaurus may have digested through a hindgut fermentation system like modern herbivorous lizards, which have several chambers in their enlarged colon.|$|E
5|$|Around 1865 John Newlands {{produced}} {{a series of}} papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar {{physical and chemical properties}} that recurred at intervals of eight; he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music, where notes an octave apart have similar musical functions. His version put all the alkali metals then known (lithium to caesium), as well as copper, silver, and thallium (<b>which</b> <b>show</b> the +1 oxidation state characteristic of the alkali metals), together into a group.

5|$|Astrology, in its {{broadest}} sense, is {{the search}} for meaning in the sky. Early evidence for humans making conscious attempts to measure, record, and predict seasonal changes by reference to astronomical cycles, appears as markings on bones and cave walls, <b>which</b> <b>show</b> that lunar cycles were being noted as early as 25,000 years ago. This was a first step towards recording the Moon's influence upon tides and rivers, and towards organising a communal calendar. Farmers addressed agricultural needs with increasing knowledge of the constellations that appear in the different seasons—and used the rising of particular star-groups to herald annual floods or seasonal activities. By the 3rd millennium BCE, civilisations had sophisticated awareness of celestial cycles, and may have oriented temples in alignment with heliacal risings of the stars.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began on}} May 5, 1931, under Brother Theophorus Kleemann, SVD, who became ill and died on September 12, 1931; Arthur Bialucha, a German {{architect}} living in Qingdao {{who had already}} completed several projects for the SVD, took over as construction superintendent. Construction was frustrated in 1933, when Adolf Hitler {{came to power in}} Germany and prohibited the transfer of money overseas. The diocese independently shouldered the cost of finishing the cathedral. This required a number of design changes to reduce costs. The changes are evident in drawings published before completion of construction, <b>which</b> <b>show</b> the roofs of the towers as bell-shaped. However, the roofs of the completed structure were changed to spires. Construction was finished in 1934, and the cathedral was consecrated on October 28 that year.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker was {{commissioned}} a lieutenant into the 196th (Western Universities) Battalion, CEF in May 1916. In September, Diefenbaker {{was part of}} a contingent of 300 junior officers sent to Britain for pre-deployment training. Diefenbaker related in his memoirs that he was hit by a shovel, and the injury eventually resulted in his being invalided home. Diefenbaker's recollections do not correspond with his army medical records, <b>which</b> <b>show</b> no contemporary account of such an injury, and his biographer, Denis Smith, speculates that any injury was psychosomatic.|$|E
