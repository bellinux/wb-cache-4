5|$|The name Eboracum {{became the}} Anglian Eoforwic in the 7thcentury: a {{compound}} of Eofor-, from the old name, and -wic a village probably by conflation of the element Ebor- with a Germanic root *eburaz (boar); by the 7thcentury the Old English for 'boar' had become eofor. Alternatively, the word eofor already existed as an Old English word for <b>wild</b> <b>swine,</b> which is a cognate of the current Low Saxon word eaver and Dutch ever. The Anglo-Saxon newcomers probably interpreted the ebor part as eofor, and -rac as ric (meaning rich), while -um was (and is) a common abbreviation of the Saxon -heem, meaning home. To them, it sounded as a 'home rich in boar'. As is common in Saxon place names, the -um part gradually faded; eoforic. When the Danish army conquered the city in 866, its name became Jórvík.|$|E
25|$|The {{wild boar}} (Sus scrofa), {{also known as}} the <b>wild</b> <b>swine</b> or Eurasian wild pig, is a suid native to much of Eurasia, North Africa, and the Greater Sunda Islands. Human {{intervention}} has spread its distribution further, making the species one of the widest-ranging mammals in the world, as well as the most widely spread suiform. Its wide range, high numbers, and adaptability mean that it is classed as least concern by the IUCN and it has become an invasive species in part of its introduced range. The animal probably originated in Southeast Asia during the Early Pleistocene, and outcompeted other suid species as it spread throughout the Old World.|$|E

Preventive archaeological excavations were carried out between 1996 / 1997 and seven historical strata were observed, from Gallo-Roman period up to Modern Times. Soil samples from cesspools, latrines, and structures-like were studied and revealed intestinal parasite eggs in the different archaeological contexts. Ascaris lumbricoides, A. suum, Trichuris trichiura, T. suis. Taenia sp., Fasciola hepatica, Diphyllobothrium sp., Capillaria sp. and Oxyuris equi eggs were found. Paleoparasitology confirmed the use of structures as latrines or cesspit as firstly supposed by the archaeologists. Medieval latrines were not only used for rejection of human excrements. The finding of Ascaris sp. and Trichuris sp. eggs may point to human's or <b>wild</b> <b>swine's</b> feces. Gallo-Roman people used to eat wild boar. Therefore, both A. suum and T. suis, or A. lumbricoides and T. trichuris, may be present, considering a swine carcass recovered into a cesspit. Careful sediment analysis may reveal its origin, although parasites of domestic animals can be found together with those of human's. Taenia sp. eggs identified in latrine samples indicate ingestion of uncooked beef with cysticercoid larvae. F. hepatica eggs suggest the ingestion of raw contaminated vegetables and Diphyllobothrium sp. eggs indicate contaminated fresh-water fish consumption. Ascaris sp. and Trichuris sp. eggs indicate fecal-oral infection by human and/or animal excrements...|$|R

On the other hand, as many as 50 out of 835 (6. 0 %) genotyped wild boars from Belarus possessed MC 1 R alleles specific to domestic pigs, demonstrating supremacy of our STR profiling system over traditional differentiation between wild boars and domestic pigs, based on single binary markers.

In humans, IAVs cause severe respiratory illness, and zoonotic transmission of IAVs from avian reservoirs poses a constant {{threat to the}} public health, as exemplified by the recent outbreak of an avian IAV of the H 7 N 9 subtype [1]. Aquatic birds {{are considered to be}} the major reservoir of IAVs, and 16 hemagglutinin (HA) and nine neuraminidase (NA) viral subtypes have been isolated from avian species to date. It is now well documented that from time to time IAVs overcome the species barrier and establish new lineages in other animals, including domestic animals, sea mammals, and humans (Fig 1). Our understanding of IAVs was recently challenged by the identification of two novel genome sequences of influenza A-like viruses from bat specimens by next-generation sequencing. These viruses were provisionally designated "H 17 N 10 " (from yellow-shouldered fruit bats [Sturnira lilium] in Guatemala) and "H 18 N 11 " (from flat-faced fruit bats [Artibeus planirostris] in Peru) [2, 3], which might signal an expansion of IAV host range (Fig 1) ...|$|R

But he persists in it, orders Robinson to persist; knocks at the Austrian door with one hand, at the Prussian or Anti-Austrian with the other; and gazes, with those proud fish-eyes, into perils and potentialities and a sea of troubles. Wearisome to think of, were not one bound to it! Here, from a singular CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY OF ENGLAND, not yet got into print, are two Excerpts; which I will request the reader to try if he can take along with him, in view of much that is Coming:-- ...|$|E

40|$|The genus Macavirus of the {{subfamily}} Gammaherpesvirinae includes {{viruses that}} infect lymphoid cells {{of domestic and}} <b>wild</b> ruminants and <b>swine,</b> causing asymptomatic latent infections in reservoir hosts. Here, we describe the genome of bovine herpesvirus 6 (BoHV- 6), a macavirus ubiquitous in healthy cattle populations. The BoHV- 6 genome exhibited architecture conserved in macaviruses, including a repetitive H-DNA region and unique, 141 kilobase pair L DNA region predicted to encode 77 genes. BoHV- 6 encoded in variable genomic regions a novel complement of genes relative to other characterized macaviruses, likely contributing to distinctive aspects of BoHV- 6 infection biology and host range. Most notably, BoHV- 6 encoded the first herpesviral protein (Bov 2. b 2) similar to cellular ornithine decarboxylase, an enzyme that catalyzes the first and rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of polyamines. Bov 2. b 2 conceivably mediates a novel mechanism by which BoHV- 6 promotes cell cycle-dependent viral replication...|$|R
40|$|Influenza A viruses have broad host tropism, {{being able}} to infect a range of hosts from <b>wild</b> fowl to <b>swine</b> to humans. This broad tropism makes highly {{pathogenic}} influenza A strains, such as H 5 N 1, potentially dangerous to humans if they gain the ability to jump from an animal reservoir to humans. How influenza A viruses are able to jump the species barrier is incompletely understood due to the complex genetic nature of the viral surface glycoprotein, hemagglutinin, which mediates entry, combined with the virus's ability to use various receptor linkages. Current therapeutics against influenza A include those that target the uncoating process after entry {{as well as those}} that prevent viral budding. While there are therapeutics in development that target entry, currently there are none clinically available. We review here the genetics of influenza A viruses that contribute to entry tropism, how these genetic alterations may contribute to receptor usage and species tropism, as well as how novel therapeutics can be developed that target the major surface glycoprotein, hemagglutinin...|$|R
40|$|Porcine brucellosis, {{caused by}} the {{bacterium}} Brucella suis, is an economically important cause of reproductive loses in pigs. This organism can be maintained in <b>wild</b> and feral <b>swine,</b> complicating eradication efforts in domesticated pigs. One variant, found only in Europe, is also maintained in hares. Some variants of B. suis mainly affect caribou, reindeer or rodents, and are not important in pigs. B. suis is zoonotic. In humans, brucellosis can be a serious, debilitating and sometimes chronic disease that may affect a variety of organs. Most cases {{are the result of}} occupational exposure to infected animals. B. suis has also been weaponized and could be used in a bioterrorist attack. Etiology In pigs, brucellosis is mainly caused by Brucella suis, a Gram–negative coccobacillus or short rod. This organism is a facultative intracellular pathogen. Other Brucella species rarely found in pigs include Brucella abortus and B. melitensis (For information on B. abortus or B. melitensis, see the factsheets titled “Bovine Brucellosis ” and “Ovine and Caprine Brucellosis, ” respectively. ...|$|R
