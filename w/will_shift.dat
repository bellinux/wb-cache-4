5|$|An outward {{shift of}} the PPF results from growth of the {{availability}} of inputs, such as physical capital or labour, or from technological progress in knowledge of how to transform inputs into outputs. Such a shift reflects, for instance, economic growth of an economy already operating at its full productivity (on the PPF), which means that more of both outputs can now be produced during the specified period of time without sacrificing the output of either good. Conversely, the PPF <b>will</b> <b>shift</b> inward if the labor force shrinks, the supply of raw materials is depleted, or a natural disaster decreases the stock of physical capital.|$|E
5|$|Goffman {{uses the}} metaphor of {{conversation}} being a stage play. A plays tone <b>will</b> <b>shift</b> throughout the performance due to the actions taken by the actors; {{this is similar to}} how a discussion is keyed – based on what either person says or does over the course of an interaction, the key will change accordingly. The parallels go further, though. Goffman also claims that a speaker details a drama more often than they provide information. They invite the listener to empathize and, as was explained above, they’re often not meant to be stirred to take action, but rather to show appreciation; during a play this generally takes the form of applause.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{presented}} in a third-person perspective, and the player can freely move in three-dimensional space and rotate the camera in any direction. The top left corner of the screen interface shows the status of Logan's armour, a 'danger-meter' which rises as the player engages enemies through combat, and a target lock. A radar is displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen which shows the location of various objects including friendly units, enemies, weapon pick ups or mission objectives. The current weapon equipped is always displayed in the bottom right corner, with the ammunition count. Depending on the weapon used, the camera <b>will</b> <b>shift</b> to first-person mode to assist in aiming.|$|E

50|$|Depending on the {{keyboard}} layout used, holding down the shift key while Caps Lock is already on is either ignored (because all keys are already <b>shifted),</b> <b>will</b> also <b>shift</b> keys which are not being shifted by Caps Lock alone (see above) or effectively invert the shifting status of each key, so that where Caps Lock shifts all keys, pressing <b>Shift</b> <b>will</b> temporarily switch to lowercase again, whereas on a keyboard where Caps Lock only shifts alphabet keys, pressing <b>Shift</b> <b>will</b> temporarily switch the alpha keys to lowercase while shifting the number row as normal. Some keyboard layouts implement a fourth variant, where <b>Shift</b> <b>will</b> temporarily invoke two different sets of alternative key definitions depending on if Caps Lock is currently active or not. The inverting behaviour of the Shift key {{is the most common}} variant on English keyboards.|$|R
50|$|The phase <b>shift</b> <b>will</b> {{be between}} 0 and 180° {{and will be}} {{respectively}} positive or negative for inductors and capacitors. The phase <b>shift</b> <b>will</b> be exactly 90° when X = Z0.|$|R
5|$|At {{the start}} of the game, a wave of Luftwaffe {{aircraft}} (in the appearance of Balkenkreuz sprites on the map) will cross the English Channel and proceed to bomb various cities, air bases and radar installations. In response, RAF squadrons are automatically scrambled and will await orders to either engage invading Luftwaffe fighters or to defend key cities from bombers. When a RAF squadron has successfully engaged a Luftwaffe unit on the map, the game <b>will</b> <b>shift</b> to a first-person shooter perspective, in which the point of view is portrayed from a cockpit of either a Spitfire or Messerschmitt Bf 109, depending on the side chosen. During the dogfight sequence, the number of Luftwaffe casualties will depend on how many aircraft the player was able to shoot down.|$|E
25|$|Graphically, {{as long as}} {{the prices}} remain constant, {{changing}} income will create a parallel shift of the budget constraint. Increasing the income <b>will</b> <b>shift</b> the budget constraint right since more of both can be bought, and decreasing income <b>will</b> <b>shift</b> it left.|$|E

50|$|When using a pegged design, {{the setup}} and {{positioning}} of the pegs is critical. Competitors work extremely close with their team to ensure that each peg is in proper location and <b>will</b> not <b>shift.</b> A peg that shifts from its location can potentially interfere with the overall break of the stack. If careful consideration and measures are not taken, pegs <b>will</b> typically <b>shift</b> during the initial stack and setting of the break.|$|R

25|$|Sodium iodide systems, as {{with all}} {{scintillator}} systems, are sensitive to changes in temperature. Changes in the operating temperature caused by changes in environmental temperature <b>will</b> <b>shift</b> the spectrum on the horizontal axis. Peak shifts of tens of channels or more are commonly observed. Such shifts can be prevented by using spectrum stabilizers.|$|E

25|$|If, in an accented unit, {{the final}} low tone falls on a moraic {{consonant}} such as , the second mora {{of a long}} vowel, or the second vowel of a diphthong, any syllable that follows will also bear a low tone. Otherwise, if the final low tone falls on a consonant-vowel syllable, any syllable that is added <b>will</b> <b>shift</b> the entire tone placement.|$|E
25|$|For {{reversible}} reactions, {{changes in}} the total pressure, temperature or reactant concentrations <b>will</b> <b>shift</b> the equilibrium so as to favor either the right or {{left side of the}} reaction in accordance with Le Chatelier's Principle. However, the reaction kinetics may either oppose or enhance the equilibrium shift. In some cases, the reaction kinetics may be the overriding factor to consider.|$|E

50|$|Taxpayers, however, <b>will</b> {{not likely}} <b>shift</b> the income to just any person, {{but may be}} <b>willing</b> to <b>shift</b> income to a close family member or friend.

The incentive, however, to shift income from the taxpayer to the taxpayer’s child is reduced by §1(g) of the Internal Revenue Code.|$|R

25|$|The {{income effect}} is a {{phenomenon}} observed through changes in purchasing power. It reveals the change in quantity demanded brought by a change in real income. The figure 1 on the left shows the consumption patterns of the consumer of two goods X1 and X2, the prices of which are p1 and p2 respectively. The initial bundle X*, is the bundle which is chosen by the consumer on the budget line B1. An increase in the money income of the consumer, with p1 and p2 constant, <b>will</b> <b>shift</b> the budget line outward parallel to itself.|$|E
