Kerry studied at a feeder program for Disney animators at CalArts, and became interested in 2-D computer animation. While there, he {{realized that it was}} possible to apply some of the techniques associated with animation to live-action. Conran had been out of film school for two years and <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> how to make a movie. He figured that Hollywood would never take a chance on an inexperienced, first-time filmmaker, so he decided to make the movie himself.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, Nathan-Turner <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> what to {{do about}} K-9. The robot dog was very popular among {{children}} but was difficult to deal with technically and Nathan-Turner felt that it made the TARDIS crew almost overwhelmingly formidable. He decided that a child-orientated spin-off series with K-9 might be just the thing. However, such a series would require a human as the lead, and his prime candidate for this role was Sladen. He pitched the part to the actress as a departure from what she had previously done: she would be returning as Sarah Jane Smith, but she would do so as the heroine and not just a sidekick. This offer Sladen accepted.|$|E

500|$|... "Two Weeks" [...] {{was written}} by Aaron Shure and {{directed}} by Paul Lieberstein. Executive story editor Charlie Grandy conceived the idea of Michael leaving Dunder Mifflin.

Lieberstein thought of the idea of the final scene in which Michael and Pam's faces go from optimism to concern, because he felt it would anchor the episode. The decision to have Charles choose Stanley as productivity czar and Kevin as receptionist was made by Shure the day before the episode's draft was handed in because he wanted to have Charles make [...] "rookie mistakes, despite all his poise." [...] "Two Weeks" [...] was the second of six episodes guest starring Idris Elba, best known as Stringer Bell from The Wire.

2500|$|Mollie King {{spoke about}} the album's sound saying {{that she had been}} joining playing on the studio [...] "messing around" [...] with a certain track. [...] "30 Days" [...] is about being a part from the person you love and {{counting}} down the minutes until you're back together. [...] "The song really struck a chord with us - it's a situation all of us can relate to, and we think a lot of fans will relate to it as well." [...] Rochelle Humes explained the concept of the single, [...] "It’s a really amazing, catchy song but the sentiment behind it is being all excited and counting down the days to seeing someone when you’ve really been missing that person." [...] The band revealed that they wanted to create an album which was [...] "amazing", [...] "crazy" [...] and [...] "very pop". King said [...] "What About Us" [...] features [...] reggae pop music influence, a little different from what band usually record, but the track is still really [...] "dancey" [...] and [...] "upbeat", as well a good song to dance to on either stage or at a club. When Una Healy was asked what the song was about she said that she [...] "did not know" [...] what the song was exactly about. [...] "To be honest I <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> the other day what exactly it's about. I could bullshit away telling you, but I really don't know. But I think it's all about someone driving you crazy." [...] She said she [...] "thinks" [...] that 'What About Us' part means [...] "me and you getting together". She did point out that she did know that the song was about [...] "making you happy" [...] and that the track was good for the summer and will get you on the dancefloor. Rochelle Humes said that the band had recorded a new track, which features a more [...] "edgy" [...] vibe than their previous material. She also said that the track would be released at the end of Summer, which was revealed to be [...] "Gentleman". She also said [...] "It's very dancey", and that they hoped to experiment with other types of music genres on the album, she said: [...] "It's {{going to be a lot}} more edgy than our previous stuff and what we are known for. I think we are definitely a pop band so we will carry on doing what we do best." [...] She said that her most favourite thing about being a singer is that she can try out different styles of genres. The band warned fans that the new album would have a [...] "fresh sound". Although, the said they weren't changing the sound too much. [...] "It's a fresh start for a new album as it's got that slight reggae vibe, but is still a dance pop record." ...|$|E
