40|$|The {{longitudinal}} and {{transverse beam}} coupling impedance {{of the first}} final TOTEM Roman Pot unit has been measured in the laboratory with the wire method. For the evaluation of transverse impedance the wire position has been kept constant, and the insertions of the RP were moved asymmetrically. With the original configuration of the RP, resonances with fairly high Q values were observed. In order to mitigate this problem, RF-absorbing ferrite plates were mounted in appropriate locations. As a result, all resonances were sufficiently damped to meet the stringent LHC beam coupling impedance requirements. THE TOTEM ROMAN POTS The LHC experiment TOTEM [1] is designed for measuring the elastic pp scattering cross-section, the total pp cross-section and diffractive processes. These physics objectives require the detection of leading protons with scattering angles of a few µrad, which is accomplished using a Roman Pot (“RP”) system with stations at 147 m and 220 m from the interaction point 5 where also CMS will be located. Each station is composed of two RP units separated by a few metres depending on beam equipment integration constraints. Each RP unit consists of a vacuum chamber equipped with two vertical insertions (top and bottom) and a horizontal one (Fig. 1). Each insertion (“pot”) contains a package of 10 silicon detectors in a secondary vacuum. The pots can be moved into the primary vacuum of the machine through vacuum bellows. In order to minimise {{the distance of the}} detectors from the beam, and to minimise multiple scattering, the wall thickness of the pot is locally reduced to a thin <b>window</b> <b>foil.</b> The low impedance budget of the LHC machine (broadband longitudinal impedance limit Z/n ≈ 0. 1 Ω) imposes a tight limit on the RPs ’ beam coupling impedance...|$|E

40|$|Introduction A widely {{distributed}} commercially available target station for the irradiation of solid targets is the COSTIS system. The system is specified for beams up to 500 W and {{is equipped with}} a front side He-cooling and water cooling on the back side. The target itself has a coin shape with a diameter of 24 mm and thickness of 2 mm. This recommends the system for irradiation of thin targets like foils but it is also useable for irradiation of metal and oxide powders. However the irradiation of powders and granulates is limited due to the dimension of the target capsule. A setup of a capped closed target is hardly achievable. The purpose of this work was the modification of the COSTIS target station for the use of thicker target capsules. This shall enable the more easy and safe handling and irradiation of powdery targets and the use of lockable target capsules. Material and Methods The adaption of the COSTIS system for wider targets is easy and fast achievable by the ex-change of the target guiding plate together with the four distance bolts and their bearings. The effort of the replacement of the standard with the modified parts is comparable with COSTIS maintenance including exchange of the <b>window</b> <b>foil</b> and the O-rings. For the target capsule itself different designs were developed and tested. Now various target capsules are available, depending on required energy, handling needs and properties of the target material. Different locking systems can be used, from “click” capsules to screwable systems. Additionally the tightness of the target capsule can be achieved by placement of on O-ring between the lid and capsule body. Results and Conclusion The wider target body allows the capping of the target material. This enables a wide range of applications. One aspect is the nanoparticle research, where radiolabelling is an excellent tool for in situ online investigations. The chosen design of the target capsule allowed the direct activation of TiO 2 nanoparticles. Via the nuclear reaction 48 Ti(p,n) 48 V radiolabelled [48 V]TiO 2 nanoparticles can be obtained. Another example is the use of recoil effects for radiolabelling of nanoparticles. In this case the kinetic energy of the product of the nuclear reaction 7 Li(p,n) 7 Be is used to implant a radioactive tracer in different nanomaterials like Ag 0 – nanoparticles and MWCNT (multi wall carbon nano tubes). In general the irradiation of powders and granulates benefits from the modified design that allows the more flexible adaption to experimental needs...|$|E

40|$|Introduction The TR- 24 is {{relatively}} new to the cyclotron market and its advantages over lower energy PET cyclotrons {{have not yet been}} fully realized. A new high current [18 F] fluoride production target that takes advantage of the higher energy and current afforded by the TR- 24 has been developed. Material and Methods The TR- 24 cyclotron presents challenges of producing conventional PET isotopes even with its variable energy capability (18 – 25 MeV). Simultaneous irradiation of two targets that require different proton energies is possible only using beam energy degrader. Due to the relatively wide energy window, the degrader design is not trivial, especially for the high current operation. For example, reduction of beam energy from 24 to 18 MeV would require the use of an approximately 1. 5 mm thick aluminum degrader. At 100 μA this degrader would have to be capable of dissipating 700 W of beam power, which would be challenging to achieve with no cooling or using a conventional helium cooling window. However, cooling water used as a beam energy degrader can dissipate several kilowatts of beam energy and provide additional cooling for target material and <b>window</b> <b>foils.</b> FIGURE 1 demonstrates the concept of the water cooled target window. A standard 18 F- water target with a 2. 5 mL fill volume and a 30 degree beam incident angle was modified to accept the new water window. A 1 mm thick region of circulating cooling water was inserted between the vacuum and the product foil. The combined beam energy degradation caused by the vacuum foil (0. 00012 “ Havar), the cooling water (1 mm) and the target foil (0. 00012 “ Havar) was approximately 7 MeV for a 24 MeV incident proton energy. The target was installed on a target selector mounted directly on the TR- 24 cyclotron. No additional beam focusing or steering devices were used to defocus or correct beam shape. A small recirculation water system was setup to supply cooling water for the degrader. A mixed bed ion exchange column was installed on the return line to trap N- 13 and radioactive metal ions that could possibly be etched from the Havar foils. The water in the degrader was continually circulated in a closed loop providing cooling to the vacuum and target foils. An 800 mL/min water flow through the degrader was generated by a low pressure water pump. Results Several tests were performed with O- 16 water to establish current – pressure curve and to determine “burn through” current (FIGURE 2). Conclusion Initial tests demonstrated that the new F- 18 target with a 1 mm water degrader is capable of accepting power levels in excess of 3. 6 kW, operating at 150 μA. More testing is under way, including testing with H 218 O to determine the F- 18 production capacity of this target.
