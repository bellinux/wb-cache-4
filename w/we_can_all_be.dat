500|$|When a final {{agreement}} was reached with the Republican legislative leadership, Dayton called a special session of the legislature on July 19. The legislature met on July 20 and passed the budget bills, which were signed the same day by the governor. Most state employees returned to work on July 21, facing a backlog of unfinished work and new problems in many agencies. After the budget was passed, Dayton said he approached Republicans again after meeting with ordinary citizens—who said they wanted government services to resume and did not care how the shutdown was ended—and because he feared a worse budget deal and unease in the DFL legislative minorities. Zellers said when the deal was finalized that in his view it was [...] "a deal that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> disappointed in, but a deal that is done, a budget that was balanced". His sentiments that a 'balanced' budget needed to be passed, and that both sides had something to be unhappy about, were echoed by Koch.|$|E

2500|$|John Wayne was {{originally}} offered {{the lead role}} in the film, but turned it down because he felt that Foreman's story was an obvious allegory against blacklisting, which he actively supported. Later, he told an interviewer that he would [...] "never regret having helped run [...] out of the country". [...] Cooper was Wayne's longtime friend, and shared his conservative political views; {{he had been a}} [...] "friendly witness" [...] before HUAC, but did not implicate anyone as a suspected Communist, and later became a vigorous opponent of blacklisting. [...] Ironically, Cooper won an Academy Award for his performance, and since he was working in Europe at the time, asked Wayne to accept the Oscar on his behalf. [...] Although Wayne's contempt for the film and refusal of its lead role were well known, he said, [...] "I'm glad to see they're giving this to a man who is not only most deserving, but has conducted himself throughout the years in our business in a manner that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> proud of ...

2500|$|The Party's Ard Fheis in 2009 {{unanimously}} {{passed a}} motion to organise in Northern Ireland by establishing forums, rather than cumainn, {{in each of the}} North's six counties. In December 2009, Fianna Fáil secured its first Northern Assembly MLA when Gerry McHugh, an independent MLA, announced he had joined the party. Mr. McHugh confirmed that although he had joined the party, he would continue to sit as an independent MLA. In June 2010, Fianna Fáil opened its first official office in the North in Crossmaglen, County Armagh. The then Taoiseach Brian Cowen officially opened the office, accompanied by Ministers Éamon Ó Cuív and Dermot Ahern and Deputies Rory O’Hanlon and Margaret Conlon. Discussing the party's slow development towards all-Ireland politics, Mr. Cowen observed: [...] "We have a very open and pragmatic approach. [...] We are a constitutional republican party and we make no secret of the aspirations on which this party was founded. [...] It has always been very clear in our mind what it is we are seeking to achieve, that is to reconcile this country and not being prisoners of our past history. [...] To be part of a generation that will build a new Ireland, an Ireland of which <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> proud".|$|E

5000|$|This is {{an example}} of the {{theoretical}} thinking shifting the emphasis from faith and theoretical principles such as sovereignty to the socio-economic logic, as Karl Marx did.Thus modern political theorists typically legitimize the state with two major ideas: redistribution and the provision of public goods. In The Limits of Government, philosopher David Schmidtz takes on the second of these ideas.While a market system may allow self-interested to create and allocate many goods optimally, there exists a class of [...] "collective" [...] - or [...] "public goods" [...] that are not produced adequately in a market system. These collective goods <b>are</b> goods that <b>all</b> individuals want but for whose production it is often not individually rational for people voluntarily to do their part to secure a collectively rational outcome. The state can step in and force us all to contribute toward the production of these goods, and <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>all</b> thereby <b>be</b> made better off.

40|$|Perturbation {{theory is}} an {{important}} tool {{in the analysis of}} oscillators and their response to external stimuli. It is predicated {{on the assumption that the}} perturbations in question are "sufficiently weak", an assumption that is not always valid when perturbative methods are applied. In this paper, we identify a number of concrete dynamical scenarios in which a standard perturbative technique, based on the infinitesimal phase response curve (PRC), is shown to give different predictions than the full model. Shear-induced chaos, i. e., chaotic behavior that results from the amplification of small perturbations by underlying shear, is missed entirely by the PRC. We show also that the presence of "sticky" phase-space structures tend to cause perturbative techniques to overestimate the frequencies and regularity of the oscillations. The phenomena <b>we</b> describe <b>can</b> <b>all</b> <b>be</b> observed in a simple 2 D neuron model, which we choose for illustration as the PRC is widely used in mathematical neuroscience...|$|R
