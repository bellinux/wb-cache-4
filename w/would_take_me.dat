500|$|She lived {{her first}} two years in Flushing, Queens, an outer borough of New York City, in a two-story house on Roosevelt Avenue between 149th and 150th Streets. Her parents {{separated}} soon after her birth and were divorced in 1928. After their separation, her mother traveled the country to pursue acting jobs and Robbins was raised in Bethesda, Maryland, for six years by her aunt, Virginia Luckett, and uncle, Audley Gailbraith. Nancy later described longing for her mother during those years: [...] "My favorite times were when Mother had a job in New York, and Aunt Virgie <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> by train to stay with her." ...|$|E
500|$|Tessa {{occasionally}} meets MacLeod's previous Immortal lovers. In [...] "", {{she immediately}} dislikes Amanda (played by Elizabeth Gracen) and the script notes that [...] "...sparks fly {{between the two}} women". Although she quickly earns Amanda's respect, Tessa feels like she has to compete with Amanda, while Amanda comments that Tessa is [...] "...quite refreshing in a gauche sort of way." [...] Gracen played Amanda's interaction with Tessa ambiguously and a little flirtatiously. Tessa is usually jealous of MacLeod's past lovers, but acknowledges in [...] "" [...] that [...] "...it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> several lifetimes to find out everything in Duncan's past. I know there've been others, but I never thought I would meet one of them." ...|$|E
500|$|Moore {{began writing}} the series very early on, hoping to avoid {{publication}} delays {{such as those}} faced by the DC limited series Camelot 3000. When writing the script for the first issue, Moore said he realized, [...] "I only had enough plot for six issues. We were contracted for 12!" [...] His solution was to alternate issues that dealt with the overall plot of the series with origin issues for the characters. Moore wrote very detailed scripts for Gibbons to work from. Gibbons recalled that [...] "he script for {{the first issue of}} Watchmen was, I think, 101 pages of typescript—single-spaced—with no gaps between the individual panel descriptions or, indeed, even between the pages." [...] Upon receiving the scripts, the artist had to number each page [...] "in case I drop them on the floor, because it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> two days to put them back in the right order", and used a highlighter pen to single out lettering and shot descriptions; he remarked, [...] "It takes quite a bit of organizing before you can actually put pen to paper." [...] Despite Moore's detailed scripts, his panel descriptions would often end with the note [...] "If that doesn't work for you, do what works best"; Gibbons nevertheless worked to Moore's instructions. In fact, Gibbons only suggested a single change to the script: a compression of Ozymandias' narration while he was preventing a sneak attack by Rorschach, as he felt that the dialog was too long to fit with the amount of action expressed; Moore agreed and re-wrote the scene. Gibbons {{had a great deal of}} autonomy in developing the visual look of Watchmen, and frequently inserted background details that Moore admitted he did not notice until later. Moore occasionally contacted fellow comics writer Neil Gaiman for answers to research questions and for quotes to include in issues.|$|E

2500|$|Not {{long before}} {{his first wife}} died, Lunn wrote, she [...] "confided to a friend that if {{anything}} ever happened to her, Phyllis <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> on, and few second marriages have been so warmly welcomed by the husband's children and friends, and for less obvious reasons by the husband's hostesses." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{reaching}} young adulthood, Purim mixed jazz with radical protest {{songs to}} defy the repressive Brazilian government of that time. A 1964 military coup in Brazil led to censorship of song lyrics, and she later commented on this period of her life as follows: [...] "I wanted to leave Brazil. There's a river there called the San Francisco River. I used to sing to the river, that, as it flowed out to the ocean, it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> to America." ...|$|E

After appearing on I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! in 2003, Westbrook admitted that she no longer wanted to be a 'celebrity', commenting [...] "I made a pact with Kevin I would do no more TV work that <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> away from home. These days, I live an ordinary life. I work occasionally, but I also do the school run and laundry and prepare my family's dinner".|$|E
2500|$|Camelot 3000 had lengthy delays {{between its}} final issues. Bolland {{recalled}} {{that he and}} DC [...] "talked {{quite a bit about}} how long it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> to do the series," [...] and because the series was inked by other artists, he started off [...] "churning the pages out with great enthusiasm." [...] As the series continued, however, Bolland became increasingly meticulous, [...] "trying to make the pages look better and better". The added details he introduced into his artwork caused significant delays in the final issues of the limited series, causing issues #8–11 to be released on a quarterly rather than monthly status, and the final issue to be cover dated nine months later than the penultimate issue.|$|E
2500|$|Hurdzan's {{career in}} golf {{actually}} began at his elementary school {{years when he}} was a caddie; he later became a greenkeeper to ASGCA past president and Ohio Historical Society inductee Jack Kidwell, and was a golf course superintendent before transitioning to a golf course architect. Howard Richman wrote that Hurdzan said that {{the first time he saw}} an overhead photo with the overlay of a golf course, was the most exciting thing for him. Hurdzan was influenced by Jack Kidwell and Geoffrey Cornish; according to Richman, [...] " [...] believes if there were two saints on earth they had to be architects Geoff Cornish and Kidwell." [...] He told Richman, [...] "Jack <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> to superintendent meetings, and I knew enough to keep my mouth shut and listen. I listened to all of the old-timers' stories and learned." [...] Hurdzan eventually became Kidwell's partner in golf course design, and subsequently owned the business.|$|E

2500|$|Sain {{considered}} Atrocious Virgin to {{be among}} his best work, referring to it on the Trance to the Sun Bandcamp website as their [...] "gothic-psychedelia magnum opus". In 2002, he commented on the experience: [...] "In the studio, it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> typically 3 weeks to finish a Trance To The Sun song; and in that 3 week period I would spend anywhere from 80 to 180 hours. I kind of logged my studio time. To {{do that kind of}} studio work by yourself, you have to take careful notes. And on the last Trance To The Sun album there's a song called [...] "Map of the Lost" [...] which set the all time record at 180 hours. [...] "Map of The Lost" [...] {{is one of the greatest}} pieces I've ever come up with. The reason it took so long is because it went through several mutilations before reaching a final stage." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kournikova {{received}} her first tennis racquet as a New Year gift in 1986 at age 5. Describing her early regimen, she said, [...] "I played two {{times a week}} from age six. It was a children's program. And it was just for fun; my parents didn't know I {{was going to play}} professionally, they just wanted me to do something because I had lots of energy. It was only when I started playing well at seven that I went to a professional academy. I would go to school, and then my parents <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> to the club, and I'd {{spend the rest of the}} day there just having fun with the kids." [...] In 1986, Kournikova became a member of the Spartak Tennis Club, coached by Larissa Preobrazhenskaya. In 1989, at the age of eight, Kournikova began appearing in junior tournaments, and by the following year, was attracting attention from tennis scouts across the world. Kournikova signed a management deal at age ten and went to Bradenton, Florida, to train at Nick Bollettieri's celebrated tennis academy.|$|E
2500|$|Hamilton {{was raised}} in Harlem, New York, Hamilton was exposed to music at an early age. [...] "My mother was an {{entertainment}} journalist for the Cleveland Call and Post, so she <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> with her to events when I was just a baby." [...] Hamilton stated his mother always made sure he had an instrument around him. His mother put different kinds of instruments {{in the basement of}} their Cleveland home, but he naturally gravitated to the keyboard. Hamilton has stated, [...] "At first, I was just playing the rhythm of the songs I would hear... The older I got, the more proficient I got at hearing the notes." [...] For most of his life, Hamilton was self-taught. Picking up the lead and bass guitar in his teenage years, as well as the drums and harmonica. Hamilton has stated that listening to other genres of music, being exposed to different cultures and experiencing life helped mold his musical sound. Hamilton would leave from his mother's home at the age of 18 and would at times be homeless spending his nights at his friends houses.|$|E

2500|$|The {{property}} behind Stimson House (on Chester Place) was {{the home}} of Carrie Estelle Doheny, the widow of wealthy oil man, Edward L. Doheny. [...] Mrs. Doheny {{had grown up in}} the neighborhood and had watched as the Stimson House was built. [...] She recalled, [...] "I remember when Mr. Stimson was building this house. [...] When I was just a little girl, my father <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> for a walk on Sunday afternoons, and we’d always walk this way to see how far along the work had progressed." [...] For eight years from 1940 to 1948, Mrs. Doheny lived behind the fraternity, and the boisterous parties in the house’s dungeon-like [...] "catacombs" [...] were an ongoing source of annoyance. [...] Mrs. Doheny repeatedly complained to the university president, Rufus B. Von Kleinsmid, about disturbances, a former house president recalling that he was called before Kleinsmid [...] "once a month or so" [...] {{as a result of her}} complaints. [...] By 1948, Mrs. Doheny had dealt with the fraternity for long enough and offered $75,000 to purchase the house that the fraternity bought eight years earlier for $20,000. [...] The fraternity house was already struggling with the cost of maintaining the large house and accepted Mrs. Doheny’s offer. [...] After the sale closed, Mrs. Doheny assured herself that she would have no further problems with noisy neighbors by deeding Stimson House to the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet for use as a convent. [...] At the time, the Los Angeles Times noted: [...] "The parlor where merry parties reveled at the turn of the century will become a chapel where reverent nuns will now bow in humble devotion. [...] The gay conversation of the festive past will yield place to solemn intonations of morning prayers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cornell was a {{close friend}} of late singer Andrew Wood, who was his roommate in Seattle. While living together, Cornell and Wood {{recorded}} the song [...] "Island of Summer", which was written by Cornell and is the only existing recording from the two of them singing together. The song was released in 2011 in the album [...] "Melodies & Dreams", a solo album from Andrew Wood featuring unreleased songs he recorded throughout his life. Wood's sudden death in 1990 led Cornell to make a tribute album for him with the band Temple of the Dog. In a 2016 interview with The Guardian promoting the first tour of Temple of the Dog, Cornell said about Wood's death: [...] "I've always had a really difficult time with loss. I didn't deal well with Andy's death. After he died, numerous times I'd be driving and I would look out the window and I thought I saw him. It <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>me</b> five minutes to update to the moment and realize, 'no, he's actually dead.' This tour, in a sense, is the dealing. It's facing the reality." [...] When asked if it is legitimate to read a songwriter's demise into his lyrics after the fact during a 1994 interview with Rolling Stone reflecting on Kurt Cobain's suicide, Cornell said; [...] "When Andy died, I couldn't listen to his songs for about two years after that, and it was for that reason— his lyrics often seem as though they can tell that story. But then again, my lyrics often could tell the same one. In terms of seeing everything as {{a matter of life and}} death— if that's what you're feeling at the time, then that's what you're going to write. It's sort of a morbid exchange when somebody who is a writer like that dies, and then everyone starts picking through all their lyrics. In Kurt's case, whatever he was thinking and whatever he was writing, there wasn't an arrow pointing at what his demise was. It's a stream of thought, it's a possibility— it's definitely something that somebody was feeling when they were writing. It doesn't mean that it's going to happen. But it doesn't necessarily mean that it isn't, either." ...|$|E
