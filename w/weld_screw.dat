A modified methacrylate adhesive was selected and tested for its mechanical properties, environmental ageing, and glass transition temperature. Adhesively bonded T-joints were manufactured and tested, and compared with the conventional screw-fastened T-joints in terms of joint strength. The initial geometry of the adhesively bonded T-joints was optimized with a finite element analysis (FEA). Finally, the various manufacturing processes (<b>welding,</b> <b>screw</b> fastening, and adhesive, bonding) were compared in economical terms, which is a critical parameter for the industry. The joint strength results show that adhesively bonded joints perform as well or better than the conventional screw-fastened joints.

The shear capacity of headed studs in composite steel-concrete beams has been determined experimentally in seven full-scale push-off tests. The tests were used to study the strength and ductility of the proposed stud system. Maximum resistances from the experimental tests are compared with the predictions of EC 4 and results from other researchers. The capacity of the stud is reduced due to fracture of the pins that occur before the shear stud had yielded. The proposed stud system can be improved further by increasing the size and the strength of the pins and base plate...|$|R

30|$|Lightweight steel {{structures}} offer an interesting alternative to more traditional construction technologies, especially for low and medium rise residential and office buildings (Casafont et al. 2006) due to some considerable advantages {{such as high}} strength-to-weight ratio, reduced labor costs, fast erection, and economical transportation due to the light weight of cold-formed members (Ebadi Tabrizi and Vosoughifar 2011; Yu and LaBoube 2010; Zaharia and Dubina 2006). Cold-formed steel sections had been considered as secondary structural members such as purlins to support roof cladding (Chung and Lau 1999).

Common yield strengths are 280 and 350 N/mm 2 (Chung and Lau 1999; Wong and Chung 2002). Moreover, there is a whole range of variants of these basic shapes, including sections with single and double lips and sections with internal stiffeners (Chung and Lau 1999).

40|$|Two simple, {{effective}} {{techniques for}} attaching thermocouples to metal substrates {{have been devised}} for high-temperature applications in which attachment by such conventional means as <b>welding,</b> <b>screws,</b> epoxy, or tape would not be effective. The techniques have been used successfully to attach 0. 005 - in. (0. 127 -mm) -diameter type-S thermocouples to substrates of niobium alloy C- 103 and stainless steel 416 for measuring temperatures up to 2, 600 F (1, 427 C). The techniques are equally applicable to other thermocouple and substrate materials. In the first technique, illustrated in {{the upper part of}} the figure, a hole slightly wider than twice the diameter of one thermocouple wire is drilled in the substrate. The thermocouple is placed in the hole, then the edge of the hole is peened in one or more places by use of a punch (see figure). The deformed material at the edge secures the thermocouple in the hole. In the second technique a hole is drilled as in the first technique, then an annular relief area is machined around the hole, resulting in structure reminiscent of a volcano in a crater. The thermocouple is placed in the hole as in the first technique, then the "volcano" material is either peened by use of a punch or crimped by use of sidecutters to secure the thermocouple in place. This second technique is preferable for very thin thermocouples [wire diameter. 0. 005 in. (. 0. 127 mm) ] because standard peening poses a greater risk of clipping one or both of the thermocouple wires. These techniques offer the following advantages over prior thermocouple-attachment techniques:. Because these techniques involve drilling of very small holes, they are minimally invasive. an important advantage in that, to a first approximation, the thermal properties of surrounding areas are not appreciably affected.. These techniques do not involve introduction of any material, other than the substrate and thermocouple materials, that could cause contamination, could decompose, or oxidize at high measurement temperatures.. The simplicity of these techniques makes it possible to attach thermocouples quickly.. These techniques can be used to attach thermocouples at locations where access is somewhat restricted by the surrounding objects...|$|R

40|$|The LiteSteel Beam (LSB) {{is a new}} hollow flange section {{developed}} in Australia with a unique geometry consisting of torsionally rigid rectangular hollow flanges and a relatively slender web. The LSB is subjected to a relatively new Lateral Distortional Buckling (LDB) mode when used as flexural members. Unlike the commonly observed lateral torsional buckling, lateral distortional buckling of LSBs is characterised by cross sectional change due to web distortion. Lateral distortional buckling causes significant moment capacity reduction for LSBs with intermediate spans. Therefore a detailed investigation was undertaken to determine the methods of reducing the effects of lateral distortional buckling in LSB flexural members. For this purpose the use of web stiffeners was investigated using finite element analyses of LSBs with different web stiffener spacing and sizes. It {{was found that the}} use of 5 mm steel plate stiffeners <b>welded</b> or <b>screwed</b> to the inner faces of the top and bottom flanges at third span points considerably reduced the lateral distortional buckling effects in LSBs.

40|$|Special moment {{resisting}} frames (SMRF) {{depend on}} large inelastic strains in the beam-to-column connections to dissipate seismic energy and protect buildings from collapse. The ANSI / AISC 341 - 10 Seismic Provisions for Structural Steel Buildings define {{the ends of}} the beams in a SMRF as protected zones at the locations where large inelastic strains are expected. In the protected zone, AISC 341 - 10 prohibits any decking attachments that penetrate the beam flange and any <b>welded,</b> bolted, <b>screwed,</b> or shot-in attachments for other purposes. However, these restrictions are based primarily on a lack of data showing that such fasteners will not cause premature low cycle fatigue fracture in the moment connection. A series of full-scale beam-to-column moment connection tests were conducted to evaluate the effects of powder actuated fasteners (PAF) applied in the protected zone on the seismic behavior of steel moment connections. The primary objective of the testing program was to determine if beam-to-column connections with deck attachments using PAF’s satisfy the SMRF qualification criteria of AISC 341 - 10.

As of 2013 only one has been examined and found to be a real test batch scoped rifle: it has serial number 3962C. It is a late dot 1942 production rifle. Recreations of this rifle using Mauser 98k zf 41 mounts sell for about US$5000.

Reproduction mounts have been <b>welded</b> or <b>screwed</b> onto g33/40 scope bases; this is incorrect both in size and construction of the original scope base mounts.

50|$|Ever {{since the}} {{development}} of wire rope, comprising multiple wire strands, spooling the wire has presented technical challenges. When wrapped in multiple layers, the upper layers {{have a tendency to}} crush the lower layers, while the lower layers have a tendency to pinch upper layers. The rubbing of rope against rope also has a tendency to cause wear.These problems were addressed by Frank L. LeBus Sr., a supplier of drilling equipment to the oilfields of Texas, USA, who in 1937, patented the use of a groove bar on hoisting drums to guide the spooling of rope. Grooved shape steel segments were simply <b>welded</b> or <b>screwed</b> to existing plain steel drums. Ever since then, drum groovings have been widely used to guide the spooling of wire rope onto and off winch drums.Introducing a continuous helical groove onto the drum, like the thread of a screw, provides a way to guide the rope when spooling onto or off a drum. However this has been shown to work effectively only when the rope is wrapped in a single layer. When the rope is wrapped in multiple layers, problems remain.Frank LeBus introduced a grooving pattern that put the groove parallel to the flanges of the drum, except for a single slanted section across the drum face to act as crossover point, moving the rope along by the width of the groove with every revolution.|$|R
