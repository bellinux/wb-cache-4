500|$|With a {{new name}} and label, the band {{released}} its second album, New American Gospel, in September 2000. Patrick Kennedy of Allmusic compared the band to Pantera stating, [...] "The essential signatures of post-Pantera metal are in abundance on Lamb of God's inaugural album. New American Gospel provides a mighty oak upon which gritty American metal's faith is maintained, effectively bridging the '90s' insistence upon drill-sergeant technicality and the old school's determined focus on riff construction." [...] Chris Adler commented: [...] "This is a classic record. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> elements come together to make one of the heaviest, yet contagious records of our career. It was difficult to contain us—we didn't even understand at the time what we had created." ...|$|E

"Then," [...] Abe said, [...] "ye had best look to yer guns, {{for they}} mean mischief; {{they must have}} been {{watching}} us this morning when we started, but concluded that the ground was too level, and that we should have time to get into position before they could get up to us, besides <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> advantage in the stockades at the station.

60|$|A {{strong wind}} was now blowing, {{and the snow}} began to form into heavy drifts. The fire was very cheery and pleasant, but the wind was cutting, and we soon {{returned}} to {{the shelter of the}} coach, where we had our breakfast. This was not altogether a cold meal, for Mrs. Aleshine had provided a little tea-kettle, and, with some snow-water which I brought in boiling from the fire in the woods, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> hot and comforting tea we wanted.|$|E
60|$|Fortune so far favored {{me as we}} {{run that}} I was speedily armed with an axe which had been left near by a pile of fuel, and before we had {{traveled}} twenty yards further Pierre came upon a pick.

60|$|And sure enough, {{not only}} she {{but her father}} and sister spoke English. So after that <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> talk we wanted; and we wanted a good deal, for they were {{agreeable}} people. They were greatly interested in our customs; especially the alpenstocks, for they had not seen any before. They said that the Neckar road was perfectly level, so we must be going to Switzerland or some other rugged country; and asked us {{if we did not}} find the walking pretty fatiguing in such warm weather. But we said no.|$|E

60|$|A half-hour later {{things had}} quieted down, and all was {{much the same}} as before the prisoners had revolted--only we kept a much closer watch on von Schoenvorts. The Geier had sunk while we were still battling upon our deck, and {{afterward}} we had drawn away toward the north, leaving the survivors {{to the attention of the}} single boat which had been making its way toward us when Olson launched the torpedo. I suppose the poor devils never reached land, and if they did, they most probably perished on that cold and unhospitable shore; but I couldn't permit them aboard the U-33. <b>We</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Germans we could take care of.|$|E

Look at all the little knick-knacks they've made for each other. Last week when I was over at Taunton, Mr. Fisher had his store all gayified up,' as Jim says, with Christmas presents. I did feel that I'd ask {{nothing better than to}} go in and buy all the lovely things I wanted, just for once, and give them to the children tomorrow morning. They've never had anything really nice for Christmas. But there! We've all got each other and good health and spirits, and a Christmas wouldn't be much without those if <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> presents in the world." ...|$|E
60|$|In {{little more}} than a month <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> measurements, and were enabled to make out the entire plan, in doing which, of course our {{previous}} knowledge of the house assisted us greatly. Papa assisted me in this. I had not, at first, told him anything of what I was doing, as I wished that, in case by any chance my scheme was detected, {{he should be able to}} say that he knew nothing about it. At last, however, I was obliged to let him into the secret, and when I told him, he was very much interested and pleased; and I do not think that I should ever have succeeded in putting the parts together, and certainly have never arrived at any accurate conclusion, without his assistance.|$|E

But <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Merediths down for dinner and nobody tried to be gay or cheerful. We were all just quiet and friendly, and that helped. Then, too, I was so thankful that Jims had got better--so thankful that I almost felt glad--almost but not quite. I wonder if I shall ever feel really glad over {{anything}} again. It seems as if gladness were killed in me--shot down by the same bullet that pierced Walter's heart. Perhaps some day a new kind of gladness will be born in my soul--but the old kind will never live again.|$|E
