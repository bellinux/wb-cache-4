5|$|Eight {{moderate}} tropical {{storms in}} total developed or existed <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> <b>of</b> the basin, slightly below {{the average of}} ten. Most systems during the season remained weak, with only three storms (Uriah, Emeraude, and Fantala) reaching at least tropical cyclone strength with winds of 120km/h (75mph), compared to the average of five. However, the season featured Cyclone Fantala, which became the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the basin in terms of 10-minute sustained winds at 250km/h (155mph).|$|E
5|$|Lying <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> <b>of</b> the {{constellation}} is the gigantic Phoenix cluster, which is around 7.3 million light years wide and 5.7 billion light years away, {{making it one}} of the most massive galaxy clusters. It was first discovered in 2010, and the central galaxy is producing an estimated 740 new stars a year. Larger still is El Gordo, or officially ACT-CL J0102-4915, whose discovery was announced in 2012. Located around 7.2 billion light years away, it is composed of two subclusters in the process of colliding, resulting in the spewing out of hot gas, seen in X-rays and infrared images.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Able in 1951 was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} the earliest forming major hurricane– a tropical cyclone with winds exceeding – however following post-storm analysis it was determined that Able only reached Category 1strength which made Hurricane Alma of 1966 the new record holder; as it became a major hurricane on June8. Though it developed <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> <b>of</b> the Atlantic hurricane season, Hurricane Audrey in 1957 became the earliest developing Category4 hurricane on record after it reached the intensity on June27. However, reanalysis from 1956 to 1960 by NOAA downgraded Audrey to a Category 3, making Hurricane Dennis of 2005 the earliest Category 4 on record on July 8, 2005. The earliest-forming Category5 hurricane, Emily, reached the highest intensity on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale on July17, 2005.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Frederick Law Olmsted {{was hired}} to survey the Bronx and map out streets based on the local geography. Olmsted noted {{the natural beauty of}} the Van Cortlandt estate, {{comparing}} it to Central Park which he designed, and recommended the city purchase the property. The land was part of a proposed greenbelt across the Bronx, consisting of parks and parkways that would align more with existing geography than a grid system similar to the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 in Manhattan. That grid had given rise to Central Park, a park with mostly artificial features <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> <b>of</b> the grid. However, in 1877, the city declined to act upon his plan.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{official}} {{end of the}} Atlantic hurricane season occurs on November30, the dates of October31 and November15 have also historically marked {{the official}} end date for the hurricane season. December, the only {{month of the year}} after the hurricane season, has featured the cyclogenesis of fourteen tropical cyclones. Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005 was the latest tropical cyclone to attain tropical storm intensity as it did so on December30. However, the second Hurricane Alice in 1954 was the latest forming tropical cyclone to attain hurricane intensity. Both Zeta and Alice were the only two storms to exist in two calendar years– the former from 1954 to 1955 and the latter from 2005 to 2006. No storms have been recorded to exceed Category1 hurricane intensity in December. In 1999, Hurricane Lenny reached Category4 intensity on November17 as it took an unprecedented west to east track across the Caribbean; its intensity made it the latest developing Category4 hurricane, though this was well <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> <b>of</b> the hurricane season. Hurricane Hattie (October 27-November 1, 1961) was initially thought to have been the latest forming Category5 hurricane ever documented, though reanalysis indicated that a devastating hurricane in 1932 reached such an intensity at a later date. Consequently, this made the hurricane the latest developing tropical cyclone to reach all four Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale classifications past Category1 intensity.|$|E
