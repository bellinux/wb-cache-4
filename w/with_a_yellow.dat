5|$|Since the 2013–14 season, Partick Thistle's kits {{have been}} {{manufactured}} by Joma Sports. During the 2014–15 season, Partick Thistle supported the Breast Cancer Care Charity by {{wearing a black}} and pink away shirt, with the charity ribbon on the shirt. The partnership saw a portion of kit sale revenue being donated to Breast Cancer Care. Partick Thistle's current home kit features a yellow and red shirt, the sleeves are yellow with a predominanty red foreground. The kit features black shorts, red socks, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>yellow</b> trim. The away kit is white, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>yellow</b> collar and sleeve trim on the jersey. Goalkeepers wear a generic kit design from Joma, and are either pink or grey.|$|E
5|$|Goliath {{operates}} {{with two}} generic steel and fiberglass trains with seven cars each. Each car seats four riders {{in a single}} row {{for a total of}} 28 riders per train.

5|$|In 1927, Mussolini {{adopted a}} {{personal}} standard consisting of fasces on a Savoy blue field <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>yellow</b> border; this was abolished in 1943. Firstly in 2001, {{and then again}} from 2008, Silvio Berlusconi adopted a similar standard {{of the office of}} Prime Minister, this time the coat of arms proper on a darker blue field with double yellow border.|$|E

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 17-18 mm. The forewings are brown, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> round <b>yellow</b> spot {{near the}} costal margin. The hindwings are slightly {{darker than the}} forewings <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pale <b>yellow</b> band.|$|R
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 23 mm. The forewings are fuscous <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pale <b>yellow</b> basal spot and subtornal semicircular orange-yellowmark. The hindwings are fuscous <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pale <b>yellow</b> mid-cell mark and white mark {{at the center}} of the dorsal margin.|$|R
5|$|Initially, Low {{used the}} same flag as Edward Teach ("Blackbeard"). Later, he used his own flag, a red {{skeletal}} figure on a black background, which became notorious. He first flew his own flag in late July 1723. Low also used a green silk flag <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>yellow</b> figure of a man blowing a trumpet; this Green Trumpeter was hoisted on the mizzen peak to call his fleet's captains to meetings aboard the flagship.|$|E
5|$|The team {{began playing}} in black shirts <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>yellow</b> sash from their {{foundation}} in 1883 as Black Arabs F.C. until 1885, {{by which time}} they were called Eastville Rovers. For the next fourteen years, until 1899, the team wore blue and white hooped shirts. These were replaced by black and white striped shirts until 1919.|$|E
5|$|Cartman {{is usually}} {{depicted}} wearing winter attire {{which consists of}} a red coat, brown pants, yellow gloves/mittens, and a yellow-brimmed turquoise knit cap tapered <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>yellow</b> pom-pom. He has parted brown hair, and he is seen without his hat more often than the other characters with distinctive headwear. As he is overweight, his body is wider, his hands noticeably larger and his head is a more elliptical shape {{in contrast to the}} circular heads of the other children. An additional curved line on his lower face represents a double chin.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 17 mm. The forewings are deep pink, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bright <b>yellow</b> patch {{at the base}} of the wing on the inner margin. The hindwings are smoky <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bright <b>yellow</b> central area on the outer margin. Adults have been recorded on wing in June.|$|R

5|$|Fox held a {{competition}} among 16 Springfields across the United States {{to host the}} American premiere. Each Springfield produced a film, explaining why their town should host the premiere, with the results being decided via {{a vote on the}} USA Today website. Springfield, Minnesota dropped out on May 31, 2007. The winner was announced on July 10 to be Springfield, Vermont. The town beat Springfield, Illinois by 15,367 votes to 14,634. Each of the other 14 entrants held their own smaller screenings of the film on July 26. Springfield, Vermont hosted the world premiere of the film on July 21 <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>yellow</b> carpet instead of the traditional red.|$|E
5|$|Many adult dragonflies have {{brilliant}} iridescent or metallic colours {{produced by}} structural coloration, making them conspicuous in flight. Their overall coloration {{is often a}} combination of yellow, red, brown, and black pigments, with structural colours. Blues are typically created by microstructures in the cuticle that reflect blue light. Greens often combine a structural blue <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>yellow</b> pigment. Freshly emerged adults, known as tenerals, are often pale-coloured and obtain their typical colours after a few days, some have their bodies covered with a pale blue, waxy powderiness called pruinosity; it wears off when scraped during mating, leaving darker areas.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the spring}} molt is complete, {{the body of}} the male is a {{brilliant}} lemon yellow, a color produced by carotenoid pigments from plant materials in its diet, with a striking jet black cap and white rump that is visible during flight. The female is mostly brown, lighter on the underside <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>yellow</b> bib. After the autumn molt, the bright summer feathers are replaced by duller plumage, becoming buff below and olive-brown above, with a pale yellow face and bib. The autumn plumage is almost identical in both sexes, but the male has yellow shoulder patches. In some winter ranges, the goldfinches lose all traces of yellow, becoming a predominantly medium tan-gray color with an olive tinge evident only on close viewing.|$|E

5|$|The {{first of}} the Cavalry uniforms {{were made by the}} cavalrymen themselves. By 1862, the Confederate {{regulations}} ordered the uniform to become organized, being cadet gray and lined with a thin layer around the sleeve. The pant legs were light blue <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>yellow</b> strip rising {{from the bottom of the}} leg to the top. Non-commissioned officers of the cavalry wore either regular clothes from home or a variety of different types of uniforms. yellow was the prescribed branch of service color, but surviving uniforms show beyond a doubt that the vast majority of cavalrymen who used any branch of service color, used buff as yellow cloth was virtually non existent in the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recruits}} to {{the force}} in 1873 were issued uniforms comprising scarlet Norfolk jackets – issued from the militia stores and chosen {{on the advice}} of Colonel Patrick Robertson Ross and Governor Alexander Morris – brown belts, white helmets, grey breeches and brown boots, with a round forage cap for their undress uniform. The grey trousers were soon replaced with blue ones, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>yellow</b> stripe along the sides. These early uniforms were quite plain, and commissioned officers and their enlisted men wore essentially the same uniform.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} CD track listing {{was released}} on September 18, 2007 in México, September 25, 2007 in United States and on February 26, 2008 in Spain with an album cover featuring the performer on a red background. On April 15, 2008, a CD/DVD format, with a black background on the cover was released, which included music videos for the 12tracks recorded on Para Siempre, directed by Benjamin Hidalgo. A karaoke version of the album, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>yellow</b> background, was released in April 2008.|$|E

5|$|In 1803, Egan {{became one}} of the pastors of St. Mary's Church at Philadelphia. The move coincided <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>yellow</b> fever {{outbreak}} in Philadelphia. Though less virulent than Philadelphia's famous 1793 outbreak of the disease, there were nonetheless many deaths, and Egan presided over many funerals that year—St. Mary's had 77 interments between June and November 1803. In 1804, Egan received permission to establish a province of Franciscans in the United States for the first time, independent of the Irish Franciscans who were then supervising the American mission. Two years later, a parishioner willed Egan some land along the Yellow Creek in Indiana County, {{for the establishment of a}} Franciscan church. Due to the order's vows of poverty, Egan asked Carroll to hold the land in his name. Egan's dream was never realized, as he was unable to attract Franciscans from Europe to establish the planned church.|$|E
5|$|The main {{building}} is a symmetrical three-storey house built of red brick, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>yellow</b> brick central range which was added later. The building has a cornice and parapet, and a bowed end which projects to the east. On the south side, there is an additional attic storey. The house retains its original sash windows, and {{on the first floor}} some of the windows have wrought-iron balconettes. An addition to the building has been made in the south-west, including an arcade on the ground floor, and a bell tower. Further additions were made to the {{main building}} in the 19th century, including a Gothic chapel of red brick with ashlar dressings to the north. There are later buildings {{on either side of the}} chapel: to the west is a 19th-century building with a two-storey entrance porch, while a Gothic cloister, comprising two walks with scissor-trussed timber roofs, lies to the east. There is a further extension to the south, which is not part of the Grade II* listing.|$|E
5|$|The plumage of {{an adult}} bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail. The tail is {{moderately}} long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but sexual dimorphism {{is evident in the}} species, in that females are 25% larger than males. The beak, feet and irises are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes. The beak is large and hooked, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>yellow</b> cere. The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range. The closely related African fish eagle (H. vocifer) (from far outside the bald eagle's range) also has a brown body, white head and tail, but differs from the bald in having a white chest and black tip to the bill.|$|E

50|$|The Chinese pond heron is {{typically}} 47 cm long <b>with</b> white wings, <b>a</b> <b>yellow</b> bill <b>with</b> <b>a</b> black tip, <b>yellow</b> eyes and legs. Its overall colour is red, {{blue and white}} during breeding season, and greyish-brown and flecked with white at other times.|$|R
50|$|The bracts are hairless, with triangular, spine-edged appendages, tipped <b>with</b> <b>a</b> stout <b>yellow</b> spine.|$|R
5|$|The club crest depicts an ox above a {{representation}} of a ford to symbolise the location. It reflects the name {{and history of the}} city, as Oxford was originally a market town situated near to a ford on the River Isis, which was used by cattle. In 2008, a bronze statue of an ox was unveiled outside of what would have been the west stand. It was subsequently vandalised in January 2011, being covered in pink paint and the club used the opportunity to raise money for a breast cancer charity. The shape and design of the crest has changed numerous times since it was first produced. When playing as Headington and {{during the early years of}} Oxford United, the crest included a full ox crossing the ford, as well as the initials H.U.F.C. (pre-1962) or the name Oxford United (post name-change). Between 1972 and 1980, the crest became circular, showing just the ox's head on a yellow and black background. The words 'Oxford United Football Club' were placed around the ox. For the next 17 years, the crest was simply the ox's head coloured blue, with various combinations of wording surrounding it. For example, in the 1987–88 season, the wording 25th Anniversary was placed under the crest. In 1996, the crest had a shield shape and contained the ox's head over the ford, on a yellow background. This version was retained until the move to the Kassam Stadium in 2001, when club steward Rob Alderman designed the current version. It has a similar design to the preceding crest, but the ox and ford are contained in a circle <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>yellow</b> background, with the remainder of the crest being coloured blue.|$|E
