5|$|Manzou is Nanako Momoi's grandfather. He is overweight, lazy, perverted, and fails as an inventor. After the exchange, {{he refuses}} to rebuild the machine as he is happier having a {{feminine}} granddaughter <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> house chores. In the second accident which undoes Akira and Nanako's exchange, he becomes amnesiac from a head injury. He is voiced by Kenichi Ogata in the three radio dramas and is portrayed by Masahiro Sato in the live action film.|$|E
5|$|Cú Roí, {{again in}} disguise, joins the Ulstermen on {{a raid on}} Inis Fer Falga (probably the Isle of Man), in return for his choice of the spoils. They steal treasure, and abduct Blathnát, {{daughter}} of the island's king, who loves Cú Chulainn. But when Cú Roí is asked to choose his share, he chooses Blathnát. Cú Chulainn tries to stop him taking her, but Cú Roí cuts his hair and drives him into the ground up to his armpits before escaping, taking Blathnát with him. Like other heroes such as the Biblical Samson, Duryodhana in the Mahabharata and the Welsh Llew Llaw Gyffes, Cú Roí can only be killed in certain contrived circumstances, which vary in {{different versions of the}} story. Blathnat discovers how to kill him and betrays him to Cú Chulainn, <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> deed. However, Ferchertne, Cú Roí's poet, enraged at the betrayal of his lord, grabs Blathnát and leaps off a cliff, killing her and himself.|$|E
5|$|Double {{burden is}} a term used to {{describe}} the workload of people who work to earn money, but who are also responsible for significant amounts of unpaid domestic labor. This phenomenon is also known as The Second Shift as in Arlie Hochschild's book of the same name. In heterosexual couples where both partners have paid jobs, women often spend significantly more time than men on household chores and caring work, such as childrearing or caring for sick family members. This outcome is determined in large part by traditional gender roles that have been accepted by society over time. Labor market constraints also play a role in determining <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> bulk of unpaid work.|$|E

5|$|In {{animated}} {{versions of}} Naruto, Sakura was voiced by Chie Nakamura. Early {{in the first}} series, the actors were told by Kishimoto that Sakura would end marrying Sasuke. However, most of them ended up having doubts as during the first anime Sasuke abandoned his teammates. As a result, by the second series, Nakamura was often asked by other people if her character would instead end with Naruto. When Sakura married Sasuke in the end, Nakamura was happy because Sakura stayed true to her feelings. In an interview, Kate Higgins, <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> voice acting for Sakura in the English dub, notes the development of Sakura in the series, remarking that she becomes a more complex character as she becomes more sensitive and caring.|$|E

25|$|Olivia King (Mag Ruffman): Hetty's {{youngest}} sibling, Olivia is more affectionate to Sara, {{and more}} sensitive and social. Most of her experiences throughout the series involve her social dealings with other Avonlea citizens. She eventually marries Jasper Dale and leaves Rose Cottage, but before this she {{works as a}} reporter for the local paper, which is how she becomes acquainted with Jasper, <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> photography for her stories. When they marry, Jasper and Olivia have a son, Montgomery, and later adopt a baby girl, Alicia, from one of their employees at the cannery. Olivia is the doppelganger of Alice Lawson (also played by Mag Ruffman), the daughter of Mr. Lawson of Lawson's General Store.

When Jasper sends her a music box for Christmas, she realizes she still does love him and decides to go home to London.|$|E

25|$|There is no {{requirement}} that the profit be directly made from the fiduciary position, merely {{in a way that}} causes a conflict between the fiduciary's personal interests and his duties. If a trustee was informed by the trust's stockbroker that only one parcel of highly sought-after stocks remained and chose to purchase it for himself rather than for the trust, he would be taking advantage of the trust and causing a conflict of interest. On the second issue, Boardman confirmed a defence of authorisation; if the fiduciary has informed the beneficiaries that he is and will be acting on his own behalf, and received permission to do so, the property would not have been held on constructive trust. The third issue is <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> fiduciary owe duties to. In Boardman the case was concerning a trust, and it was held that the duties were towards the beneficiaries. Section 170 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that in situations concerning companies, the duties of the directors and other fiduciaries are to that company.|$|E
25|$|Not {{long after}} {{declaring that the}} fight was off, Arum {{had a change of}} heart and offered Mayweather a 24-hour take-it-or-leave-it {{deadline}} to accept Team Pacquiao's terms for drug testing. Top Rank sent out a press release explaining their position on Mayweather's request for random Olympic-style drug testing. In it, Arum said Pacquiao was willing to submit to as many random urine tests requested, but as far as random blood tests were concerned, he was only willing to subject himself to 3 tests—one in January, one 30 days from the bout (no later than February 13) and one immediately after the fight: Let's be very clear on the real issues we differ on. It's not about being tested....It's about <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> testing and the scheduling of the procedures....The major issue related to the testing rests with which independent agency will administer these tests. The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) cannot do it because they will not amend its procedures to accommodate the blood testing schedule we have outlined. USADA, under its guidelines, would have the right to administer random blood tests as many times as they want up to weigh-in day and that is ludicrous.|$|E
25|$|Isaac Anderson, The New York Times Book Review (January 7, 1940) — There {{is more of}} Archie Goodwin than of Nero Wolfe in this book, {{and that}} is all to the good, for, {{although}} Wolfe is Archie's boss and the one <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> heavy thinking, Archie is, unless our guess is wide of the mark, the person whom readers of the Nero Wolfe stories take to their hearts. If Nero is the brains of the concern, Archie is its arms and hands and legs. When Nero wants something done, he does not need to tell Archie how to do it. Archie will figure that out for himself, and the thing is as good as done, however difficult the assignment may be. In the murder case with which this story deals there are international complications which make things unusually difficult. The police and the G-men are in it too, but the best that they can do is to watch Nero Wolfe and wait for him to come through with the solution. The book is full of surprises for everybody concerned, including not only the reader but also the police, Archie and even Nero Wolfe himself. Read one chapter of this book and you will need no urging to go on with it.|$|E

Inoue was surprised about Kakashi's popularity within the Naruto fans and expected people to continue supporting him. In an interview, Dave Wittenberg, <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> voice acting for Kakashi in the English dub, comments that he feels he {{is similar to the}} character since he tends to have one eye open at a time and he becomes angry if he is interrupted while reading. He also added that what he likes most about Kakashi is his relation with his students, noting him to be [...] "a very nice person".|$|E
500|$|The {{dialogue}} {{spoken by}} the giant mutant Stan {{was inspired by}} a mentally handicapped character in the MTV show How's Your News?, which Parker and Stone produced; according to Parker and Stone, the character could only say phrases like [...] "Bubba chop, bubba chewy chomp", and both men took turns voicing mutant Stan to sound the same way. Isaac Hayes, <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> voice of Chef, recorded all his lines via phone from New York; Parker and Stone said they were nervous to ask him to repeat the line, [...] "Now I know how all those white women felt", but he had no problem repeating it. The genetic mutations Dr. Mephesto creates, including the animals with multiple asses and the goldfish with bunny ears, were inspired by things Parker drew during high school.|$|E

Mears was using an elaborate animatronic suit that he compared to [...] "kind of like NASCAR where I’m piloting it but I'm {{not doing it}} by myself...I think there’s like five guys controlling the individual parts of the character. There’s one person <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> eye brows, one person does the feet." [...] Janssen, who could not [...] "say enough things about Tommy [...] ", said she was especially impressed at how he stuck to his specific vision and [...] "fought" [...] hard to hire a number of unknown European actors {{that would otherwise be}} unlikely to appear in a big studio American film, in effect making it a much more international production.|$|E
500|$|In a {{scene in}} the episode, Homer and Kogen are in Moe's tavern, {{discussing}} their favourite football teams with Moe. When Moe mentions that his favourite team is the Atlanta Falcons, he holds a glass {{in front of his}} mouth, obscuring his lip movements. He then passes the same glass to Homer, <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> same. Originally, the characters would be saying something else, however, because the staff wanted the episode to be [...] "current", new dialogue was recorded for the scene. Because {{there was no time to}} animate the scene from scratch, the staff simply made the characters hold a glass in front of their mouths while saying their lines. This technique was also used in reference to the ongoing impeachment scandal, as when the characters mention that the President and First Lady will be there, they cover their mouths when calling them by name. The song that plays during the bus trip to the Super Bowl was performed by NRBQ. The episode also features British rock band Blur's [...] "Song 2", which plays during the [...] "race" [...] to the stadium.|$|E

500|$|Reception towards Mulan's {{personality}} and characterization have been generally positive. Time Out hailed Mulan as [...] "A feisty young go-getter [...] {{rises above the}} male-dominated world in which she lives." [...] Ken Fox of TV Guide wrote, [...] "Intelligent and fiercely independent, Mulan... runs afoul of social expectations that a woman will be always obedient and duty-bound to her husband." [...] Bridget Byrne of Boxoffice wrote that [...] "Mulan... has pride, charm, spirit and aesthetic appeal which prevents her from being upstaged by the vigorous and exciting action in which she participates." [...] Varietys Todd McCarthy praised the character for inspiring [...] "a turn of the circle from such age-old Disney classics... in which passive heroines were rescued by blandly noble princes." [...] McCarthy continued, [...] "Here, it's the girl <b>who</b> <b>does</b> <b>the</b> rescuing, saving not only the prince but the emperor himself from oblivion, and this in a distant culture where women were expected to obey strictly prescribed rules." [...] Similarly, Margaret A. McGurk of The Cincinnati Inquirer lauded Mulan for [...] "solv her G.I. Jane dilemma by proving that brains {{can do more than}} brawn." [...] Hailing the character as [...] "Among the strongest heroines in Walt's cartoon canon," [...] Ian Freer of Empire enthused, [...] "Mulan's engaging mixture of vulnerability and derring-do becomes incredibly easy to root for." [...] Hollis Chacona of The Austin Chronicle dubbed Mulan a [...] "winning protagonist." [...] Likewise, the Los Angeles Times Kenneth Turan wrote, [...] "As a vivacious rebel who has to be true to herself no matter what, Mulan is an excellent heroine, perfect for the young female demographic the studio is most anxious to attract", additionally calling her a [...] "more likable and resourceful role model than Pocahontas".|$|E
