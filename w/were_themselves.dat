5|$|Additionally, {{the figures}} from 2012 show that 34.7% of the {{permanent}} resident population aged 15 or over in Switzerland (around 2.33 million), had an immigrant background. A third of this population (853,000) held Swiss citizenship. Four fifths of persons with an immigration background <b>were</b> <b>themselves</b> immigrants (first generation foreigners and native-born and naturalised Swiss citizens), whereas one fifth were born in Switzerland (second generation foreigners and native-born and naturalised Swiss citizens).|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature that}} {{was ahead of}} its time was the use of dynamic brakes, where some (or most) of the braking effect is created by running the {{traction}} motors in reverse as generators, and then dissipating the generated electrical power in resistors to produce heat. In this case, the heat was generated in the locomotive as opposed to the more typically roof-top open-air coolers seen on most modern locomotives. The resistors <b>were</b> <b>themselves</b> cooled by the water from the steam loop, heating it. This allowed the braking energy to be recuperated, or as it is more typically known, offered regenerative braking.|$|E

The troops were organized under a Franco-Japanese command, the commander-in-chief Ōtori Keisuke being seconded by the French captain Jules Brunet, and divided between four brigades. Each of these was commanded by a French non-commissioned officer (Fortant, Marlin, Cazeneuve, Bouffier), and <b>were</b> <b>themselves</b> divided into eight half-brigades, each under Japanese command.|$|E
5|$|In {{a note on}} torsion, Thompson {{mentions}} Charles Darwin's {{treatment of}} climbing plants which often spiral around a support, noting that Darwin also observed that the spiralling stems <b>were</b> <b>themselves</b> twisted. Thompson disagrees with Darwin's teleological explanation, that the twisting makes the stems stiffer {{in the same way}} as the twisting of a rope; Thompson's view is that the mechanical adhesion of the climbing stem to the support sets up a system of forces which act as a 'couple' offset from the centre of the stem, making it twist.|$|E
5|$|Louis {{came down}} firmly {{in favour of}} Henry, but the French {{arbitration}} failed to achieve peace as the rebellious barons {{refused to accept the}} verdict. England slipped back into the Second Barons' War, which was won by Henry's son, Prince Edward. Edward also invoked Magna Carta in advancing his cause, arguing that the reformers had taken matters too far and <b>were</b> <b>themselves</b> acting against Magna Carta. In a conciliatory gesture after the barons had been defeated, in 1267 Henry issued the Statute of Marlborough, which included a fresh commitment to observe the terms of Magna Carta.|$|E

5|$|Metformin {{was first}} {{described}} in the scientific literature in 1922, by Emil Werner and James Bell, as a product in the synthesis of N,N-dimethylguanidine. In 1929, Slotta and Tschesche discovered its sugar-lowering action in rabbits, finding it the most potent biguanide analog they studied. This result was completely forgotten, as other guanidine analogs, such as the synthalins, took over and <b>were</b> <b>themselves</b> soon overshadowed by insulin.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the long}} term, Tchaikovsky's {{influence}} over the Belyayev composers was not as great. Though they remained more eclectic in their musical approach and focused more on absolute music than The Five had done, they continued writing overall in a style more akin to Rimsky-Korsakov than to Tchaikovsky. Even Glazunov backed away from echoing Tchaikovsky strongly in his mature work, instead amalgamating nationalistic and cosmopolitan styles in an eclectic approach. The Belyayev composers also spread the nationalist musical aesthetic to Russia {{as a whole and}} <b>were</b> <b>themselves</b> an influence on composers well into the Soviet era.|$|E

5|$|The {{match is}} mostly remembered for Billy Bremner and Kevin Keegan being jointly {{dismissed}} {{from the field}} by referee Bob Matthewson in the 60th minute after they had a fight.

5|$|The method {{chosen by}} PAVN {{to defeat the}} {{invasion}} was to first isolate the northern firebases by utilizing anti-aircraft artillery. The outposts would then be pounded by round-the-clock mortar, artillery, and rocket fire. Although the ARVN firebases <b>were</b> <b>themselves</b> equipped with artillery, their guns were quickly outranged by PAVN's Soviet-supplied 122mm and 130mm pieces, which simply stood off and pounded the positions at will. The defensive edge {{that could have been}} provided by the utilization of tactical B-52 bomber strikes was nullified by the close-in tactics of the communist forces. Massed ground attacks, supported by artillery and armor would then finish the job.|$|E

5|$|Chen Guangcheng, a blind self-taught Weiquan lawyer, rose to {{prominence}} for defending victims of China's one-child policy.
