5|$|Doctors <b>will</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{prescribe}} immunosuppressive {{drugs such}} as prednisolone and ciclosporin if the patient is suffering from an intense form of solar urticaria. However, {{the side effects of}} these medicines can be severe which is why they are reserved for the most extreme of cases.|$|E
5|$|Large {{fish are}} caught with the bill-tip, then tossed {{up in the}} air to be caught and slid into the gullet head-first. A gull <b>will</b> <b>{{sometimes}}</b> stand on the pelican's head, peck it to distraction, and grab a fish from the open bill. Pelicans in their turn sometimes snatch prey from other waterbirds.|$|E
5|$|Male blackcaps <b>will</b> <b>sometimes</b> sing {{even when}} incubating, {{especially}} with the second brood. This appears to be intended to maintain the bond with the female. Wintering birds in Africa are quiet initially, but start singing in January or February prior to their return north.|$|E
50|$|Sheila <b>Wills</b> (<b>sometimes</b> {{credited}} as Sheila DeWindt) is an American actress. She {{is known}} for her regular role on the television series B.J. and the Bear, and recurring roles on series including Days of Our Lives, Battlestar Galactica, and Generations.|$|R
6000|$|... 'And of course,' {{he said to}} Gerald, 'horses HAVEN'T got a {{complete}} will, like human beings. A horse has no ONE will. Every horse, strictly, has two wills. With one will, it wants to put itself in the human power completely--and with the other, {{it wants to be}} free, wild. The two <b>wills</b> <b>sometimes</b> lock--you know that, if ever you've felt a horse bolt, while you've been driving it.' ...|$|R

5|$|P. labiata <b>will</b> <b>sometimes</b> {{approach}} a translucent nest containing another spider, and will usually wait facing the prey {{for up to}} several hours. Occasionally P. labiata leaps at the prey in the nest, but this is ineffective.|$|E
5|$|Athletes <b>will</b> <b>sometimes</b> become {{citizens}} {{of a different}} nation so {{they are able to}} compete in the Olympics. This is often because they are drawn to sponsorships or training facilities in such places as the United States. It could also be because an athlete is unable to qualify from within their original country. The athlete may not qualify because there are already qualified athletes in the athlete's home country. Between 1992 and 2008, about fifty athletes emigrated to the United States to compete on the US Olympic team after having previously competed for another nation.|$|E
5|$|Black-backed and side-striped jackals, and African golden wolves {{will feed}} {{alongside}} hyenas, though {{they will be}} chased if they approach too closely. Spotted hyenas <b>will</b> <b>sometimes</b> follow jackals and wolves during the gazelle fawning season, as jackals and wolves are effective at tracking and catching young animals. Hyenas do not take to eating wolf flesh readily; four hyenas were reported to take half an hour in eating a golden wolf. Overall, the two animals typically ignore each other {{when there is no}} food or young at stake.|$|E

5|$|His curveball, like Madison Bumgarner, has two speeds with {{different}} types of movement, though he throws his slow curveball much more frequently than does Bumgarner, and <b>will</b> <b>sometimes</b> throw a curve that is more in the middle range combining the types of movement. His two-seamer is his most-used pitch against right-handed hitters and is used more frequently than against lefties, as is his slider. His changeup is only thrown to left-handed hitters. Greinke's curveball is typically used early in the count, while his slider is his most common 2-strike pitch.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} save energy, the Volt <b>will</b> <b>sometimes</b> heat the seats instead of blowing heated air through HVAC system, as heating the vehicle's cabin draws {{significant}} power, and can even exceed {{what is needed to}} move the vehicle on occasions. A power-saving stereo system uses amplifiers that switch on and off rapidly to save power. It uses 50 percent less energy. The system is also lighter because the use of high grade neodymium magnets.|$|E
5|$|Mourning doves can be {{afflicted with}} several {{different}} parasites and diseases, including tapeworms, nematodes, mites, and lice. The mouth-dwelling parasite Trichomonas gallinae is particularly severe. While a mourning dove <b>will</b> <b>sometimes</b> host it without symptoms, it will often cause yellowish {{growth in the}} mouth and esophagus that will eventually starve the host to death. Avian pox is a common, insect-vectored disease.|$|E

5|$|Proposed {{methods for}} {{controlling}} gopher populations in agricultural areas include poisoning dandelions, clover, carrots, {{sweet potatoes and}} parsnips. Camas pocket gophers are larger than other gophers, so conventional gopher traps may fail to capture them. Toxic baits and fumigants may also fail, since the gophers <b>will</b> <b>sometimes</b> wall off {{a segment of the}} burrow. Gophers may also cause local flooding if their tunneling activities damage levees.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight is}} weak-looking and {{resembles that of}} a bat, with {{fluttering}} interspersed with short glides. When feeding, the birds hang with raised wings and patter on the surface with their feet, but, unlike the Wilson's storm petrel, do not {{look as if they}} are walking on the water. Birds <b>will</b> <b>sometimes</b> settle on the sea. Like other petrels, the European storm petrel cannot walk properly on land, but shuffles on its tarsi; once there is enough room, the bird flaps its wings to support itself on its toes.|$|E
5|$|The greater {{adjutant}} {{is usually}} seen singly {{or in small}} groups as it stalks about in shallow lakes or drying lake beds and garbage dumps. It is often found {{in the company of}} kites and vultures and <b>will</b> <b>sometimes</b> sit hunched still for long durations. They may also hold their wings outstretched, presumably to control their temperature. They soar on thermals using their large outstretched wings.|$|E

50|$|A dead pool, {{also known}} as a death pool, is a game of {{prediction}} which involves guessing when someone <b>will</b> die. <b>Sometimes</b> it is a bet where money is involved.|$|R
2500|$|To {{assist in}} {{removing}} their boots, seniors {{are allowed to}} yell [...] "I need a fish!" [...] at which point all available freshmen in the senior's outfit <b>will</b> race—and <b>sometimes</b> fight—to assist.|$|R
5|$|The male then {{leads the}} female to {{potential}} nest sites, {{and the female}} will choose one. The female dove builds the nest. The male will fly about, gather material, {{and bring it to}} her. The male will stand on the female's back and give the material to the female, who then builds it into the nest. The nest is constructed of twigs, conifer needles, or grass blades, and is of flimsy construction. Mourning doves <b>will</b> <b>sometimes</b> requisition the unused nests of other mourning doves, other birds, or arboreal mammals such as squirrels.|$|E
5|$|When a room is {{occupied}} {{only by a}} single person, some men will position themselves to suggest what they might like from someone joining them in the room: those {{who would like to}} be penetrated anally ("bottoms") <b>will</b> <b>sometimes</b> lie face down on the bed with the door open, while those who prefer to penetrate others ("tops") or to receive fellatio might lie face up.|$|E
5|$|All {{species are}} predators and scavengers. Iridomyrmex ants tend to many Hemiptera insects and {{butterfly}} larvae to receive honeydew. Workers forage and scavenge for small insects, and they collect nectar from flowers and hunt for prey. Iridomyrmex ants normally forage on the ground, but most species will forage up into trees and vegetation {{to look for}} food. Most ants are diurnal foragers, but some are nocturnal. These nocturnal ants <b>will</b> <b>sometimes</b> become active during the day, but this depends on the suitability of the weather. They will also block their entrance holes when it is daytime; however, I. bigi is nocturnal and never comes out during the day. In a few species, a nest will not {{be placed in a}} shaded area; this is so it can warm up during the early mornings and workers can forage shortly after sunrise.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have made}} a mistake,--as young women <b>will</b> do <b>sometimes,</b> {{even when they are}} as prudent and circumspect as you are,--and now you don't quite like the task of putting it right." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{position}} of an heir apparent is normally unshakable: {{it can be}} assumed they <b>will</b> inherit. <b>Sometimes,</b> however, extraordinary events - such as the death or the de{{position of}} the parent - intervene.|$|R
5|$|Both {{enemies and}} their bullets can be shot down. Defeating enemies <b>will</b> <b>sometimes</b> reveal item boxes, which can hold {{precious}} metals such as {{gold and silver}} for extra points, and bombs. Only five bombs can be held at a time, {{which can be used}} to clear the screen of enemies. Weapon upgrades may appear after defeating certain enemies. These weapons, such as shotguns and machine guns, will increase the player's firing speed or damage output. When a player's bullets hit an enemy, a gauge {{at the bottom of the}} screen will gradually fill. Once filled, the player will be awarded with a Vulcan gun, the most powerful weapon in the game which grants invincibility. The gauge will then begin to deplete and the Vulcan gun will disappear once empty.|$|E
5|$|Fragments of Him is a first-person narrative-based {{video game}} set around {{the death of}} a {{bisexual}} man named Will. The player controls four characters, each of whom was connected to Will during his lifetime. The characters consist of: Will, who dies in a car crash early in the game; Sarah, Will's ex-girlfriend; Harry, Will's boyfriend {{at the time of his}} death; and Mary, Will's grandmother. The gameplay has the player character walk around the world, with the player triggering snippets of narration by clicking on highlighted objects. When interacting with non-player characters, clicking on them <b>will</b> <b>sometimes</b> result in them disappearing and reappearing in a different location to give the impression of them walking.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are known}} to be aggressive, with larger and older turtles being more dominant. Larger males rank higher on the social {{hierarchy}} often created by wood turtle colonies. In the wild, the submissive turtle is either forced to flee, or is bombarded with physical abuses, which include biting, shoving, and ramming. Larger and more dominant males <b>will</b> <b>sometimes</b> try to remove a subordinate male while he is mating with a female. The defender will, if he does not successfully fight for his position, lose the female to the larger male. Therefore, among males, there is a direct relationship between copulation opportunities and social rank. However, the outcome of encounters between two turtles is more aggression-dependent than size-dependent. The wood turtle that is more protective of his or her area is the victor. Physical bouts between wood turtles (regardless of gender) increases marginally during the fall and spring (times of mating).|$|E

50|$|The {{mantled howler}} is diurnal and arboreal. Movement within the {{rainforest}} canopy and floor includes quadrupedalism (walking and running on supports), bridging (crossing gaps by stretching), and climbing. It <b>will</b> also <b>sometimes</b> leap {{to get to}} another limb.|$|R
