5|$|The French author Jules Roy {{suggests}} that Admiral Radford discussed with the French {{the possibility of}} using nuclear <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> support of the French garrison. Moreover, John Foster Dulles reportedly mentioned the possibility of lending atomic bombs to the French for use at Điện Biên Phủ, and a similar source claims that the British Foreign Secretary Sir Anthony Eden was aware of the possibility of the use of nuclear <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> that region.|$|E
5|$|A {{contemporary}} (1944–45) Canadian Army survey questioned 161 army officers, who {{had recently}} left combat, {{about the effectiveness of}} 31 different infantry <b>weapons.</b> <b>In</b> that survey the PIAT was ranked the number one most “outstandlingly effective” weapon, followed by the Bren gun in second place.|$|E
5|$|Another popular view among {{critics of}} the bombings, {{originating}} with Gar Alperovitz in 1965 and becoming the default position in Japanese school history textbooks, {{is the idea of}} atomic diplomacy: that the United States used nuclear <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> order to intimidate the Soviet Union {{in the early stages of}} the Cold War.|$|E

50|$|Research {{into the}} {{development}} of nuclear weapons was undertaken during World War II by the United States (in cooperation with the United Kingdom and Canada), Germany, Japan, and the USSR. The United States {{was the first and}} is the only country to have used a nuclear <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> war, when it used two bombs against Japan in August 1945. With their loss during the war, Germany and Japan ceased to be involved <b>in</b> any nuclear <b>weapon</b> research. <b>In</b> August 1949, the USSR tested a nuclear weapon. The United Kingdom tested a nuclear <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> October 1952. France developed a nuclear <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> 1960. The People's Republic of China detonated a nuclear <b>weapon</b> <b>in</b> 1964. India exploded a nuclear device in 1974, and Pakistan conducted a series of nuclear <b>weapon</b> tests <b>in</b> May 1998, following tests by India earlier that month. In 2006, North Korea conducted its first nuclear test.|$|R

5|$|Following the Dunkirk {{evacuation}} in 1940, Britain faced {{a shortage}} of <b>weapons.</b> <b>In</b> particular, there was a severe scarcity of anti-tank weapons, many of {{which had to be}} left behind in France.

5|$|Gerardo Mazzetta {{and colleagues}} (1998) {{propose that the}} horns might also {{have been used to}} injure or kill small prey.

After Diefenbaker was out of office, Canada went on to have nuclear weapons, from a US nuclear sharing agreement, from 1963 to 1984.|$|E

5|$|Bradley {{raised the}} {{possibility}} of using nuclear <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> Korea at a Joint Chiefs of Staff meeting on 9 July 1950 at Eisenhower's instigation, but there was no support for the idea. The Army staff sent a cable to Collins in Tokyo suggesting that he seek out MacArthur's opinion. In a teleconference on 13 July, Major General Charles L. Bolte proposed sending nuclear weapons. MacArthur had already turned down Air Force proposals to fire bomb North Korean cities, and suggested that atomic bombs could be used to isolate North Korea by taking out bridges and tunnels. The Army staff considered this impractical. However, on 28 July, the Joint Chiefs decided to send ten nuclear-capable B-29 bombers of the 9th Bombardment Wing to Guam as a deterrent to Chinese action against Taiwan. Truman publicly denied that he was considering the use of nuclear <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> Korea, but authorised the transfer to Guam of atomic bombs without their fissile cores. The deployment did not go well; one of the bombers crashed on takeoff from Fairfield-Suisun Air Force Base in California on 5 August, killing the mission commander, Brigadier General Robert F. Travis, and 18 others. The remaining nine bombers remained in Guam until 13 September, when they returned to the United States. The bomb assemblies stayed behind.|$|E

5|$|During {{the final}} stage of World War II, the United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively.

The two bombings killed at least 129,000 people (most of whom were civilians) and remain the only use of nuclear <b>weapons</b> <b>in</b> the history of warfare.|$|E
