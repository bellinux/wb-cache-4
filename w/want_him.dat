5|$|Aged 17, Brooks swam 51.91s in Perth in January 1980, {{breaking}} Tonelli's Australian {{record in}} the 100m freestyle.

Brooks walked out of the camp and returned to Perth to train under Duff. At the Australian Championships, the 100m was seen as a clash between Tonelli and Brooks. The latter came second in the 100m freestyle, outsprinted in the dying stages by Tonelli, who reclaimed his national record in a time of 51.80s.
