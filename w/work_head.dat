5000|$|Different Fur {{was founded}} in 1968 by the {{electronic}} music composer and keyboardist Patrick Gleeson and John Vieira. Its name was suggested by poet Michael McClure, while he was being recorded by Gleeson. By the early 1970s Gleeson was doing sessions with Jefferson Starship on his recently acquired 8-track recorder and Moog synthesizer. It was his expertise in early synthesizers, like the Moog, which eventually led Gleeson to collaborations with Herbie Hancock, whom Gleeson credits with helping Different Fur get off the ground. By 1971 Gleeson was working with Hancock on his albums Crossings and Sextant. He went on to record many of the synthesizers on Hancock's master <b>work</b> <b>Head</b> Hunters, {{as well as several}} solo albums at Different Fur.Gleeson eventually sold Different Fur in 1985.

The crowd at the party appear to be sleeping in different areas, and are awoken by the music. They all start to dance, and scenes of the party are intercut with scenes of a scantily dressed Gaga dancing in a poncho, with a disco ball or in a small rubber pool playing with an inflated killer whale. She wears a blue, lightning-bolt shaped sticker beneath her right eye like that on the single cover, which paid tribute to the album cover of David Bowie's Aladdin Sane, as he is one of her musical idols. O'Donis appears in the video being flanked by several girls during the [...] "When I come through on the dance floor" [...] interlude. Cameo appearances are made by Akon and Space Cowboy.

The accuracy with which the model predicts the behavior of the corresponding biological or wet splicing system is investigated. A simple example of a wet splicing system is shown to generate in vitro the splicing language predicted by the corresponding dry splicing system. 1. Introduction In 1987 Tom Head introduced a mathematical model of the generative capacity of linear DNA molecules in the presence of restriction enzymes and a ligase, which he called splicing systems. According to the original model, a splicing system consists of a nite initial set of strings over an alphabet, and a nite set of rules by which the strings can be spliced together to form new strings in addition to the initial strings. The closure of the initial set under the splicing operation generates a splicing language. In his original <b>work</b> <b>Head</b> p [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Fibrous porous {{media has}} been found in a variety of {{industrial}} applications including filters and insulation materials. In nuclear power plants, fibrous media are found as insulation materials to prevent heat loss and protect the containment structures and other components from thermal effects. However, in spite of efficient thermal insulation, fibrous media have been focused on as a hazard in the Emergency Core Cooling Systems (ECCSs). Fibrous debris generated from fiberglass insulation materials during a Loss of Coolant Accident (LOCA) might accumulate on the containment sump strainer causing loss of Net Positive Suction Head (NPSH), called the upstream effect, or it might penetrate through the strainer becoming a source of clogging for flow channels in the core (downstream effect). In the present <b>work,</b> <b>head</b> loss through fibrous porous media made of the same fiberglass insulation material used in pressurized water reactors (PWRs) were experimentally investigated to study upstream effects. Porosity of fibrous porous media was also considered by measuring build-up of debris beds. In order to study downstream effects, quantity of debris bypass was examined by changing the type of water, concentration of debris, fluid approach velocity, and temperature. As results, a head loss model, a compression model, and a debris bypass model were proposed for the given conditions in this study. Additionally, a microscope system was developed to characterize size distribution of irregular-shaped fibrous debris. The methodology was applied to three samples and the maximum fraction of debris bypass was found in the size range of 10 to 250 ?m...|$|E
40|$|The {{borehole}} {{heat exchangers}} of today suffer from poor thermal and hydrodynamic performance. The {{purpose of this}} thesis {{is to improve the}} performance of ground source heat pump systems and thermal energy storages by increasing the energy efficiency of the borehole heat exchangers. For this reason, the annular coaxial borehole heat exchanger (CBHE) has been analyzed. This type of heat exchanger is interesting in terms of both thermal and hydrodynamic performance. A model has been set up in the program Comsol Multiphysics in order to investigate the heat transfer characteristics along the borehole. A literature survey that summarizes the analytical calculation methods developed in earlier Swedish research is presented in the report. Different geometries with or without insulation of the central pipe have been analyzed and the effective borehole resistance for each geometry has been calculated based on the simulation results. The model has been validated against a recently performed thermal response test, and shows very good correlation with reality. The results from the simulations show that by using the annular CBHE an increase of 2 - 3 °C in the evaporator of the heat pump can be achieved. Calculations show that the pump <b>work</b> (<b>head</b> loss) can be reduced to 1 / 6 of the corresponding case with a single U-pipe. There arises a vertical temperature gradient in the bedrock when recharging and extracting heat with the annular CBHE. This means that the annular CBHE acts like a counter-flow heat exchanger which is thermally optimal. In total, the simulation result shows that the annular CBHE geometry in this thesis can increase a system's seasonal performance factor (SPF) with 10 - 19 % in comparison with a U-pipe BHE. This is equivalent to 10 - 19 % lower electrical power consumption every year...|$|E
