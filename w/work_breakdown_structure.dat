25|$|As a discipline, project {{management}} developed from several fields of application including civil construction, engineering, and heavy defense activity. Two forefathers of {{project management}} are Henry Gantt, called {{the father of}} planning and control techniques, who is famous for {{his use of the}} Gantt chart as a project management tool (alternatively Harmonogram first proposed by Karol Adamiecki); and Henri Fayol for his creation of the five management functions that form the foundation of the body of knowledge associated with project and program management. Both Gantt and Fayol were students of Frederick Winslow Taylor's theories of scientific management. His work is the forerunner to modern project management tools including <b>work</b> <b>breakdown</b> <b>structure</b> (WBS) and resource allocation.|$|E

Post-optimality analysis information available in most mathematical programming software packages can be used to fine tune both bids and operational schedules. We provide several illustrative examples of the modeling approach and conclude with suggestions for future research. project planning budgeting work packages...|$|R

The apparent benefits of project management have seen its use expand into Knowledge Economy applications and beyond, with varied success.
