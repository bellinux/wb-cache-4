25|$|Debate on {{a second}} gas {{pipeline}} from Alberta to California served as {{a good example of}} changing values during this period. For decades, California consumers opposed rival pipelines for fear of having to pay higher gas prices to cover pipeline construction.

Gone <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> when the pipeline company moved the gas and also marketed it.|$|E
25|$|The classic {{system of}} Year Bearers {{described}} above is found at Tikal {{and in the}} Dresden Codex. During the Late Classic period {{a different set of}} Year Bearers was in use in Campeche. In this system, the Year Bearers were the Tzolk'in that coincided with 1 Pop. These were Ak'b'al, Lamat, B'en and Edz'nab. During the Post-Classic period in Yucatán a third system was in use. In this system the Year Bearers <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> that coincided with 2 Pop: K'an, Muluc, Ix and Kawak. This system is found in the Chronicle of Oxkutzcab. In addition, just before the Spanish conquest in Mayapan the Maya began to number the days of the Haab' from 1 to 20. In this system the Year Bearers are the same as in the 1 Pop – Campeche system. The Classic Year Bearer system is still in use in the Guatemalan highlands and in Veracruz, Oaxaca and Chiapas, Mexico.|$|E

25|$|Eleanor, aged {{twelve to}} fifteen, then became the Duchess of Aquitaine, {{and thus the}} most {{eligible}} heiress in Europe. As these <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> when kidnapping an heiress {{was seen as a}} viable option for obtaining a title, William dictated a will on the very day he died that bequeathed his domains to Eleanor and appointed King Louis VI of France as her guardian. William requested of the king that he take care of both the lands and the duchess, and find her a suitable husband. However, until a husband was found, the king had the legal right to Eleanor's lands. The duke also insisted to his companions that his death be kept a secret until Louis was informed; the men were to journey from Saint James of Compostela across the Pyrenees as quickly as possible to call at Bordeaux to notify the archbishop, then to make all speed to Paris to inform the king.|$|E
25|$|These <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> when {{liberalisation}} of the EU/EEA internal {{air transport}} market {{was still in}} progress and when domestic traffic rights were reserved for each member country's own airlines. The German government therefore insisted that all non-German EU/EEA carriers either withdraw their internal German scheduled services from Berlin or transfer them to majority German-owned subsidiaries {{by the end of}} 1992. It also wanted the bulk of all charter flights from Berlin to be operated by German airlines. These measures were squarely aimed at UK carriers with a major presence in the internal German air transport market from Berlin as well as the city's charter market, specifically British Airways and Dan-Air. Lufthansa and other German airlines reportedly lobbied their government to curtail British Airways's and Dan-Air's activities in Berlin, arguing that German airlines enjoyed no equivalent rights in the UK. This resulted in British Airways taking a 49% stake in Friedrichshafen-based German regional airline Delta Air, renaming it Deutsche BA (DBA) and transferring its internal German traffic rights to the new airline. BA also replaced the commuter aircraft DBA had inherited from Delta Air with new Boeing 737-300s. These in turn replaced the Boeing 737-200 Adv and BAe ATP airliners British Airways had used on its internal German scheduled services from Berlin.|$|E
25|$|Hay left Gainsborough {{and began}} working with Ealing in 1940, this was in an attempt for him to break up his {{partnership}} with Graham Moffatt and Moore Marriott who Hay had long expressed his dissatisfaction at being associated with. Claude Hulbert and Charles Hawtrey acted as Hay's sidekick in his first film for Ealing, The Ghost of St Michael's (1941). Both would return to act with Hay in respective films, Hawtrey in The Goose Steps Out (1942) and Hulbert in Hay's final film, My Learned Friend (1943). John Mills, who had appeared in Hay's first film, Those <b>Were</b> <b>the</b> <b>Days</b> returned to act as his sidekick in The Black Sheep of Whitehall. The Goose Steps Out (1942) for Ealing was an effective piece of anti-Nazi slapstick, in the film, Hay acts as a British spy posing as a Nazi official and teaches Nazi students about British customs. When lecturing them on this topic, he tells the students that the V sign (often used in Britain as an insult) is a mark of respect, and instructs the class to make a synchronized V sign to a portrait of Adolf Hitler. This scene is often {{considered one of the}} most iconic from a British comedy film. During Hay's tenure with Ealing he was credited as a director in three of his films, The Black Sheep of Whitehall, The Goose Steps Out and My Learned Friend. In all three, he co-directed with Basil Dearden. In 1942, he starred in a short information film, Go to Blazes alongside Thora Hird and Muriel George. The film was set during the Blitz and his role was a dim-witted father who tried unsuccessfully to defuse a bomb which had landed near his house, the bomb is only defused through the help of his daughter, portrayed by Hird. Also in 1942, he made an appearance in the propaganda film, The Big Blockade among other prolific actors of the time, including Leslie Banks, John Mills and Michael Redgrave.|$|E

500|$|Creation of the {{monument}} resulted in a temporary closing of the lands to prospecting and mining. However, Death Valley was quickly reopened to mining by Congressional action in June of the same year.

Gone <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of the [...] "single-blanket, jackass prospector" [...] long associated with the romantic west. Open pit and strip mines scarred the landscape as international mining corporations bought claims in highly visible areas of the national monument.

500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the Taylor {{report on the}} Hillsborough {{disaster}} was published, which recommended that football stadia become all-seater. The North Bank, which had become home of Arsenal's most passionate supporters, was demolished {{at the end of}} the 1991–92 season. During redevelopment, a giant mural of fans was placed behind the goal at that end, to give the illusion that the players were kicking towards a crowd rather than a construction site. The mural initially attracted criticism for its absence of black fans, which was quickly rectified. Populous (then LOBB Partnership) designed all-seater two-tier North Bank Stand, the last area of Highbury to be refurbished, which was opened in August 1993 at a cost of £20 million amid strong opposition from local residents. The new North Bank Stand contained a museum and a concourse with video arcades, bars, confectionery counters, souvenir shops and fast-food stands. [...] While the all-seater North Bank was [...] "never the same as the old-fashioned Archibald Leitch stand" [...] that it replaced, it was [...] "much more like the future of Arsenal than the past" [...] with its added amenities and [...] "Gone <b>were</b> <b>the</b> <b>days</b> of pushing a petrified child through a packed crowd and placing them on a barrier from which they could only see a small section of the pitch". The old stand had received a fitting send off with a 5–1 defeat of Southampton, though the new stand had a less auspicious start, the first game being a surprise 0–3 defeat to Coventry City with all 3 goals coming from striker Micky Quinn. The first victory came 10 days later against Leeds United.|$|E
