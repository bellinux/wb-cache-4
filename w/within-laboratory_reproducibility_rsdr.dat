The cocoa powder revealed the maximum metal concentrations of 0. 303 Â± 0. 035 mg/kg for cadmium, 1. 228 Â± 0. 146 mg/kg for lead and 0. 094 Â± 0. 013 mg/kg for arsenic. A significant difference was found between cocoa powder and chocolate samples (p <. 05) ...|$|R
40|$|A liquid {{chromatography}} tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) confirmatory method for the simultaneous determination of nine corticosteroids in liver, including the four MRL compounds listed in Council Regulation 37 / 2010, was developed. After an enzymatic deconjugation and a solvent extraction {{of the liver}} tissue, the resulting solution was cleaned up through an SPE Oasis HLB cartridge. The analytes were then detected by {{liquid chromatography}}-negative-ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry, using deuterium-labelled internal standards. The procedure was validated as a quantitative confirmatory method according to the Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC criteria. The {{results showed that the}} method was suitable for statutory residue testing regarding the following performance characteristics: instrumental linearity, specificity, precision (repeatability and intra-laboratory reproducibility), recovery, decision limit (CCα), detection capability (CCβ) and ruggedness. All the corticosteroids can be detected at a concentration around 1 μg kg(- 1); the recoveries were above 62 % for all the analytes. Repeatability and <b>reproducibility</b> (<b>within-laboratory</b> <b>reproducibility)</b> for all the analytes were below 7. 65 % and 15. 5 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{main problem}} in {{determination}} of chloramphenicol in food {{of animal origin}} is a large number of matrices. The main target {{of this study was to}} create a method for determination and confirmation of chloramphenicol in products and {{food of animal origin}}. Material and Methods: Each 5 g matrix sample was mixed with 5 mL of water and 10 mL of acetonitrile/ethyl acetate, homogenised, and centrifuged. The organic layer was evaporated and redissolved in 6 mL of 4 % NaCl. The extract was cleaned up by SPE technique. Chloramphenicol was analysed by LC-MS/MS in electrospray mode. Results: The procedure was validated according to the Commission Decision No. 2002 / 657 /EC. The apparent recoveries were in the range of 92. 1 % to 107. 1 % with a repeatability less than 11. 0 % (4. 4 %- 11. 0 %) and <b>within-laboratory</b> <b>reproducibility</b> below 13. 6 % (4. 7 %- 13. 6 %). Conclusion: The method was successfully validated and proved to be efficient, precise, and useful for quantification of chloramphenicol in more than 20 different matrices...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{simple and}} {{inexpensive}} sample preparation method based on solvent extraction, followed by low temperature cleanup, was demonstrated {{to be applicable}} for the determination of avermectin and milbemycin residues in bovine muscle by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and liquid chromatography with fluorescence (LC-FL) detection. The analytical methodology was validated according to the Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC, using LC-MS/MS for confirmatory and LC-FL for quantitative purposes. Mean recovery was between 88. 9 and 100. 7 % in three distinct concentrations. The coefficient of variation for repeatability and <b>within-laboratory</b> <b>reproducibility</b> ranged from 0. 78 to 5. 1 % and from 0. 28 to 9. 0 %, respectively. Method precision led to satisfactory values of decision limits (CCα) and detection capabilities (CCβ). The proposed method has been applied in the Brazilian National Residue Control Plan since 2010 for the determination of avermectins and milbemycin residues in bovine muscle samples. A total of 760 samples were analyzed {{and none of them}} presented residues at concentrations above the permitted levels established by the more recently applied directives...|$|R
40|$|A method {{validation}} {{study for the}} determination of ochratoxin A in Capsicum spp. (paprika and chilli) was conducted according to the IUPAC harmonized protocol. The method {{is based on the}} extraction of samples with aqueous methanol, followed by an immunoaffinity clean-up. The determination is carried out by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography coupled with a fluorescence detector. The study involved 21 participants representing a cross section of research, private and official control laboratories from 14 EU Member States and Singapore. Mean recoveries reported ranged from 83. 7 to 87. 5 %. The relative standard deviation for repeatability (RSDr) ranged from 1. 7 to 14. 3 %. The relative standard deviation for <b>reproducibility</b> (<b>RSDR)</b> ranged from 9. 1 to 27. 5 %, reflecting HorRat values from 0. 4 to 1. 3 according to the Horwitz function modified by Thompson. The correction for recovery of results from naturally contaminated samples further improved the reproducibility of the method. The method showed acceptable within-laboratory and between-laboratory precision for each matrix, and conforms to requirements set by current European Union legislation. JRC.

40|$|The {{performance}} characteristics of an analytical method based on {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} (HPLC) {{for the detection of}} the banned growth promoters, carbadox and olaquindox, in feedstuff were determined via a collaborative study. The relative standard deviation of repeatability (RSDr) ranged 1. 1 - 5. 5 % for carbadox and 2. 5 - 6. 2 % for olaquindox. The relative standard deviation of <b>reproducibility</b> (<b>RSDR)</b> ranged 6. 4 - 10. 7 % for carbadox and 12. 8 - 20. 0 % for olaquindox. In all cases, the HORRAT values were equal or below the critical value of 1. 5. Moreover, trueness in all cases was between the acceptance limits of 80 and 110 %. Consequently, it was concluded that the method is suitable for quantitative evaluation. The method was also qualitatively assessed in terms of correct identification of the target analytes by examination of the UV spectrum when the more specific diode array detector was coupled to HPLC. In all cases, the percentage of correct identifications was 94 % for olaquindox and carbadox, while the percentage of false negatives was 6 %, suggesting the extended utilization of the HPLC method from quantitative to confirmatory status with a diode array detector...|$|R
