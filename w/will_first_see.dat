60|$|The enquirer would next {{come to the}} {{important}} point, whether man tends to increase at so rapid a rate, as to lead to occasional severe struggles for existence, and consequently to beneficial variations, whether in body or mind, being preserved, and injurious ones eliminated. Do the races or species of men, whichever term may be applied, encroach on and replace each other, so that some finally become extinct? We shall see that all these questions, as indeed is obvious in respect to most of them, must {{be answered in the}} affirmative, {{in the same manner as}} with the lower animals. But the several considerations just referred to may be conveniently deferred for a time; and we <b>will</b> <b>first</b> <b>see</b> how far the bodily structure of man shows traces, more or less plain, of his descent from some lower form.

6000|$|You <b>will</b> <b>first</b> <b>see</b> in how {{confidential}} {{a manner}} Hoolas Roy was employed, {{and in what}} light he was held: that he was employed to carry some instructions which do not indeed appear, but were accompanied by an order from Mr. Middleton. [...] "When these instructions shall come to you, to put these prisoners in irons and keep them without food, &c." [...] The Begums say, without food and water. Et cetera are words of large import; but he was [...] "to keep them without food, &c., agreeable to my instructions of yesterday." [...] This was a pretty general warrant for sufferings. This Hoolas Roy, this mere news-writer, was not only intrusted with this warrant, but Mr. Middleton declares {{him to be a}} person who was to be received there, and to represent the Nabob, and very justly too; for he, Mr. Middleton, was undoubtedly the real nabob of the country. The man, therefore, whom they talk of in this contemptuous manner in order to make slight of an observation we made, and which I shall make again, and whom they affect to consider as a mere paragraph-monger in some scandalous newspaper, was a man vested by Mr. Middleton with authority equal to that of the Nabob himself.|$|E

It is, I confess, but cursorily written; yet the judgment, which is given here, is generally founded upon experience: but because many men are shocked at the name of rules, as if they were a kind of magisterial prescription upon poets, I will conclude with the words of Rapin, in his Reflections on Aristotle's Work of Poetry: [...] "If the rules be well considered, we shall find them to be made only to reduce nature into method, to trace her step by step, and not to suffer the least mark of her to escape us: it is only by these, that probability in fiction is maintained, which is the soul of poetry. They are founded upon good sense, and sound reason, rather than on authority; for though Aristotle and Horace are produced, yet no man must argue, that what they write is true, because they writ it; but 'tis evident, by the ridiculous mistakes and gross absurdities, which have been made by those poets who have taken their fancy only for their guide, that if this fancy be not regulated, it is a mere caprice, and utterly incapable to produce a reasonable and judicious poem." ...|$|E

5000|$|The UPC-A's {{left-hand}} side digits (the digits {{to the left}} of the M (middle) guard pattern) have odd parity, which means the total width of the black bars is an odd number of modules, on the contrary, the right-hand side digits have even parity. Consequently, a UPC scanner can determine whether it is scanning a symbol from left-to-right or from right-to-left (the symbol is upside-down). After seeing a S (start) or E (end) guard pattern (they are the same, bar-space-bar, whichever direction they are read), the scanner <b>will</b> <b>first</b> <b>see</b> odd parity digits, if scanning left-to-right, or even parity digits, if scanning right-to-left. With the parity/direction information, an upside-down symbol will not confuse the scanner. When confronted with an upside-down symbol, the scanner may simply ignore it (many scanners alternate left-to-right and right-to-left scans, so they will read the symbol on a subsequent pass) or recognize the digits and put them in the right order. There is another property in the digit encoding. The right-hand side digits are the optical inverse of the {{left-hand side}} digits, i.e. black bars are turned into white spaces and vice versa. For example, the left-hand side [...] "4" [...] is space×1 - bar×1 - space×3 - bar×2, meanwhile the right-hand side [...] "4" [...] is bar×1 - space×1 - bar×3 - space×2.|$|E

We will also examine confidences in which participants clearly stand behind what they say, using many personal pronouns and especially the recurrent form "moi je" (this would account for tension according to Vion). We will then try to explain the emergence of such forms in our data, where decency and restraint generally prevail over subjectivity.

40|$|Today we <b>will</b> <b>first</b> <b>see</b> a file-maintenance {{algorithm}} {{that allows}} random inserts and deletes in O(lg 2 n) {{time in a}} sequential file taking linear space. Then we will move onto algorithms that care about memory hierarchy. In modern computers, memory is not flat. It has multiple levels of progressively slower and larger memory. Thus it is not equally costly to access all items in memory. For example, if you store a matrix in row-order, then scanning in row-order is much faster than scanning in column order. Our goal to get models that capture this behavior and analyze why some algorithms do so well. We will see two memory hierarchy models {{that will be used}} later to analyze various algorithms and data structures. The first algorithm we see is an ordered-file-maintainence algorithm which can be implemented in a file system for random insertions and deletions in a file. This basic algorithm will be later used as a black box for more complicated algorithms. 2 Ordered-File Maintenance [IKR 81, BDFC 00] 2. 1 Problem Statement Given n elements in some order, store them in that order in an array of size O(n).

40|$|International audienceSince 1998, {{during all}} my visits to China, I {{have noticed that}} the {{representation}} of the Westerner (generally White) in Chinese street advertisements or billboards was often associated {{in one way or another}} with a certain idea of excellence, high quality, luxury or fashion. Similarly, the presence of a Chinese person (or Chinese references, or even oriental references, because this concept is still strongly linked to China) in Western commercials is most of the time associated with the concepts of mystery, wisdom, spirituality or eternity. By these representations, and beyond the formal differences, one single goal is targeted: to add valueto a product, by using the Other (and by exploiting ignorance of the Other,stereotypes on the Other and common ideas on the Other) to create identity: a brand identity, and therefore, the consumer's identity. We <b>will</b> <b>first</b> <b>see</b> what is added, as a value, by using {{the representation of the}} Other in advertisement.

In particular, the magnifications between a `U'-shaped caustic crossing can be close to unity, rather than having a minimum magnification of 3 as in the single plane binary lensing.

40|$|In this lecture, {{we study}} network design problems, where {{the goal is}} to find a good {{subgraph}} (e. g. low cost, low maximum degree, etc) satisfying given connectivity requirements (e. g. reliability, efficiency). These problems capture classical problems in combinatorial optimization and also have many applications. This lecture consists of two parts. In the first part we discuss the minimum bounded degree spanning tree problem. We will present a + 2 -approximation algorithm based on the iterative relaxation method (see also Lecture 19), which uses the LP for the minimum spanning tree problem in Lecture 11. In the second part, we will study the survivable network design problem, and present a 2 -approximation algorithm, which is based on the iterative rounding method, where the iterative relaxation method is built on. 20. 1 Minimum Bounded Degree Spanning Tree In this section, we study the minimum bounded degree spanning tree problem. We <b>will</b> <b>first</b> <b>see</b> a special case of the problem when the graph is unweighted. Then we review the linear programming of the minimum spanning tree problem and give a slightly different way to prove that the optimal solution is integral. Then we generalize it to give a + 2 -approximation algorithm for the minimum bounded degree spanning tree problem...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{investigations}} have {{proved that the}} aborigines obtained the siliceous rocks used {{in the manufacture of}} their stone implements from two sources, viz. 1) From certain localities where such kinds of rocks occur in situ 2) From the gravel deposits of pleistocene and modern age, in the shape of waterworn boulders. The former localities have very aptly been termed "native quarries," but it appears that, though these quarries were extensively worked, the material obtained from this source was not of the same importance as that obtained from the gravel beds. The total of tero-watta made from locally occurring rock, therefore, does not exceed 14 or 15 per cent. We, therefore, see that at the outside 15 per cent, of the tero watta were manufactured from rock obtained in quarries, while 85 per cent, were manufactured from rocks otherwise obtained. Now, how were the tero-watta manufactured? The answer to this question is more difficult than it appears, and we <b>will</b> <b>first</b> <b>see</b> whether the historical accounts help to solve the problem. In Conclusion The raw material required for the manufacture of tero-watta was for the greater part obtained in the shape of water-worn pebbles from the gravel beds, for the smaller part from so-called quarries. It was also concluded that the parent block was broken by means of a hammer-stone. Includes plates...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{the ideas and}} the choices which have been made throughout {{the development of the}} Muscadet theorem prover. We <b>will</b> <b>first</b> <b>see</b> the principles and main ideas which lead to a first prover {{in the context of the}} time, influenced by a famous paper by Woody Bledsoe. This program used natural methods and was applied to set theory. It was then rewritten as a knowledge based-system where an inference engine applied rules, given or automatically built by metarules which expressed general or specific mathematical knowledge. It has been applied to some difficult problems. In order to allow more flexibility for expressing knowledge, it has been rewritten in Prolog, allowing the knowledge to be more or less declarative or procedural. To work with the TPTP Library the system had to work without knowing anything about mathematics except predicate calculus. All mathematical concepts had to be defined with mathematical statements, and the membership relation handled as any other binary relation. To avoid translating knowledge to TPTP syntax, TPTP syntax has been used (this unfortunately forbade the use of some abbreviations mathematicians are comfortable with). Last but not least, the relevant trace has been extracted to give a proof easily read by anyone, except in the case of failure, when all steps may be displayed to understand (manually) the reasons for the failure. Muscadet has participated to CASC competitions. The results show its complementarity with regard to resolution-based provers. ...|$|E
