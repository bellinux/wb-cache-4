40|$|Abiotic {{environmental}} factors of biological productivity were studied in seven lakes with low water exchange {{and a few}} inflows in different landscapes of Karelia (Russia). Lakes are not exposed to human impact. An indicator of the biological productivity is the phytoplankton photosynthesis rate calculated on the concentration of phosphorus in water. The water bodies vary from oligotrophic to mesotrophic according to their trophic level. Cluster and component analysis of chemicals was carried out, hydrological, morphometric and landscape characteristics of the lakes were also determined. It was shown that {{in the absence of}} anthropogenic influence the availability of phosphorus and trophic level of the studied lakes in the humid zone are determined by the water exchange, effluent per unit of water column, color of water and landscape features. The most productive water bodies are located on the fluvioglacial and moraine plains dominated by podsolic soils, which have a good flashing regime and soluble humus substances. These lakes are distinguished by a larger inflow of phosphorus forming a part of humus substances originated from the <b>water-collecting</b> <b>area</b> per unit of water column. Oligotrophic lakes are located in moraine and selga landscapes dominated by podbours and brown soils with a lot of humus slightly transformed. These lakes are characterized by less water exchange and drainage factor, and, accordingly, low values of phosphorus input and water color...|$|E
40|$|In {{light of}} the current ability to treat point source {{pollution}}, nonpoint source (NPS) pollution has become {{the primary cause of}} water pollution. In order to manage and control NPS pollution, we must conduct research on NPS pollution. An effective means for such an endeavor is to construct a mathematical model. However, in the present continuous time and distributed parameter NPS models, such as SWAT, parameter requirements are so numerous that their application is very difficult. In order to make such a model convenient for application, research was first conducted before constructing a new continuous time and distributed parameter NPS pollution model based on hydrodynamics. In this paper, as one of its sub-models, the runoff sub-model is introduced. This sub-model is composed of the SCS model and the water routing model that was constructed by the authors of this paper. This water routing model is based on Saint-Venant equations. Through Laplace transform and inverse Laplace transform mathematical modeling, the outflow hydrograph that is an S-curve was obtained. Then, the authors built the relation between S-curve and <b>water-collecting</b> <b>area</b> coefficient, from which the water routing model is derived. In order to calibrate and validate the new model, the authors applied it in the Guishuihe watershed with satisfactory results. The results show that it has value in application, especially in the area where data are scarce...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the level}} of heavy metals (Zn, Mn, Fe, Pb, Co, Ni, Cd) and characteristics of their transportation through the water of minor rivers in Rivne region, Ukraine. The levels of Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co {{in the waters of}} these fisheries exceeded the maximum permissible concentration limit in different months. We found that the concentration of Pb and Cd did not exceed the permissible concentration limit in the waters of the fisheries during the year of research, while {{the level of}} other metals exceeded the permissible levels by 1. 1 to 151. 0 times. This research confirms that the surface waters of Rivne region are characterized by high concentrations of iron, manganese, zinc, and nickel. The level of iron exceeded the maximum permissible concentration limit by 1. 1 to 5. 0 times, the level of zinc by 1. 5 to 15. 0 times, that of manganese by 1. 3 to 6. 7 times and the nickel level by 1. 3 to 151. 0 times in the fishery waters. In principle, the increase in the level of heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co) is connected with the lithological composition of reservoirs in the <b>water-collecting</b> <b>areas</b> of the investigated rivers, and besides with the significant influence of the anthropogenic load (fuel combustion, aqueous wastes of factory units, agricultural effluent, etc.), and with the increase in aquatic vegetation, pH balance, temperature change and so on. The appearance of iron-manganese compounds can be explained by natural causes such as reformation of the source minerals into secondary minerals in the conditions of pH level recession in water, which causes the release of these molecular entities; leaching of iron from the iron-manganese septarian nodules, a substantial amount of which is contained in the illuvial horizon. The increase in the level of zinc and nickel in the river water is connected with the leaching of these elements from subsurface rocks, soil and forest leaf litter. Atmospheric condensation is a significant source of the presence of nickel in the surface water. For the investigated rivers, the most significant factors in the water’s chemical composition are physiographic (foremost, the character of the soil cover, intensivity of erosion, extent of forest and swamp cover) and anthropogenous impact. In the rivers of Rivne region high concentrations of heavy metals are the consequence of the long-term aggradation of abiotic and biotic substances of the water ecosystem. There is a tendency for a reduction in the concentration of most metals in the abiotic substances of the water reservoir during the vegetative season and an increase after the end of this season. This research shows that the high level of contamination of the water of Rivne region’s minor rivers by the investigated heavy metal components is caused primarily by anthropogenic factors...|$|R
