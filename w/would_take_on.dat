5|$|Anxious {{to protect}} the Papal States' {{precarious}} diplomatic position, the Cardinal Secretary of State Giacomo Antonelli liaised with Rome's Jewish community to arrange a meeting with Momolo Mortara, and received him politely in early August 1858. Antonelli promised that the matter would be referred to the Pope and granted Momolo's request that he be allowed to visit Edgardo regularly in the House of Catechumens. Kertzer cites Antonelli's concession of repeated visits, {{as opposed to the}} usual single meeting, as the first sign that the Mortara case <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> a special significance.|$|E

The next season, the Warriors would win the 2017 NBA Finals against the defending champions Cleveland Cavaliers, giving Nash his first NBA championship in any role.|$|E
5|$|Robin Raphel {{began her}} career in the U.S. {{government}} as {{an analyst at the}} CIA after graduating with her master's degree.

She <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> a range of assignments for the next decade, including posts in London, until she was appointed as Political Counselor at the U.S. Embassy in Pretoria, South Africa in 1988. In 1991, she took the assignment of Political Counselor at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi, India.|$|E

5|$|The {{net result}} was that little work was done on the Waterloo Medal. In 1832, the Master of the Mint, Lord Auckland, noted that the dies had been long delayed. In 1836, the new Master, Henry Labouchere, also complained about the delay, feeling the medal could be {{finished}} in 18 months. He offered Pistrucci extra payment if he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> four apprentices and finish the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci declined.|$|E
5|$|Those {{with the}} skills and {{inclination}} to write Welsh recipes, the upper classes, conformed to English styles and therefore would not have run their houses with traditional Welsh cuisine.

5|$|Although the 2012 Olympic men's {{basketball}} tournament was then {{more than a}} year away, qualifying tournaments in all five of FIBA's continental zones were to be held in the Northern Hemisphere summer of 2011 (the traditional basketball offseason throughout the world). The lockout resulted in the suspension of an agreement between the NBA and FIBA by which the NBA <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> most of the costs for insuring the value of its players' contracts in the event they were injured during international competition. As a result, national federations that wish to have NBA players on their squads must now provide full coverage instead of supplemental insurance.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to reporting active processors, Folding@home determines its computing performance as measured in floating point {{operations per second}} (FLOPS) based on the actual execution time of its calculations. Originally this was reported as native FLOPS: the raw performance from each given type of processing hardware. In March 2009 Folding@home began reporting the performance in native and x86 FLOPS, the latter being an estimation of how many FLOPS the calculation <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> a standard x86 CPU architecture, which is commonly used as a performance reference. Specialized hardware such as GPUs can efficiently perform some complex functions in one floating point operation which otherwise needs multiple operations on the x86 architecture. The x86 measurement attempts to even out these hardware differences. Despite conservative conversions, the GPU clients' x86 FLOPS are consistently greater than their native FLOPS and comprise {{a large majority of}} Folding@home's measured computing performance.|$|E

However, CECAFA Secretary General Nicholas Musonye decided to move the remaining group games from the Namboole Stadium since {{it had been in}} bad shape due to heavy rains. It was confirmed that on Saturday, 1 December, Somalia would play Tanzania at the Lugogo Stadium at 14:00 UTC+3 while Eritrea <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> Rwanda at the same venue two hours later.

5|$|A First Deputy Premier {{was usually}} given {{responsibility}} over one specific area. For example, Kirill Mazurov {{was responsible for}} industry, and Dmitry Polyansky was agriculture. However, after Polyansky's departure in 1973 Mazurov was left the sole First Deputy Premier until Tikhonov was appointed in 1976. An officeholder could also be responsible for coordinating the activities of ministries and state committees and other subordinate bodies of the Council of Ministers. To do this the First Deputy Premier had to give these bodies guidance in an expeditious manner to ensure the implementation of plans for {{economic and social development}} and to check if the orders and decisions of the Council of Ministers were being followed. If the Premier could not perform his duties one of the First Deputy Premiers <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the role of acting Premier until the Premier's return. During the late 1970s, when the health of Premier Alexei Kosygin deteriorated, Nikolai Tikhonov, the First Deputy Premier, acted on his behalf during his absence. When Tikhonov took command of the Soviet economy, Kosygin served in a standby role. At a Central Committee plenum in June 1980, the Soviet economic development plan was outlined by Tikhonov, and not Kosygin.|$|E

5|$|After Operation Credible Sport {{ended the}} Army {{leadership}} decided the unit {{was needed for}} future contingency operations. Thusly, on October 16, 1981 Task Force 158 became the 160th Aviation Battalion, with Brown a founding member. The choice of the unit's name was accepted by the U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry as a logical progression of the 101st's 158th and 159th Battalions. The 160th Aviation Battalion was later renamed the 160th Special Operations Aviation Group in 1986; {{it was not until}} 1990 when it <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> its current name, 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. In October 1983, Brown participated in the invasion of Grenada, during which his unit became the first aviation unit to use night vision goggles in combat. In the late 1980s, Brown led all U.S. forces assigned to Operation Prime Chance, which provided escort security for American-flagged Kuwaiti tankers during the Iran-Iraq War. During Operation Prime Chance Brown's unit became the first aviation unit to engage in combat using night vision devices when they engaged an Iranian-flagged ship, Iran Ajr, that was seen deploying mines in the Persian Gulf.|$|E
5|$|This {{effectively}} left Pistrucci {{with little}} {{to do at the}} Mint. He created several medallic works, for example a small memorial medal for the King's brother, Frederick, Duke of York in 1827 that was popular, in royal circles, mounted in rings. He was asked to design the Coronation medal after King William IV came to the throne on George's death in 1830, but declined as he was asked to copy a bust by Chantrey, and the King refused to sit for him. He created, in 1830–1831, the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal, the first non-campaign medal of the British Army. He took twelve months to do so, a period of time Craig found unduly long. He continued to cut cameos, and to work, slowly, on the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci's biographer, Michael A. March, tied his disinclination to work on the Waterloo Medal to his unhappiness about his position at the Mint, and he may have concluded that he would be sacked if he finished the medal. In 1836, the new Master, Henry Labouchere, stated that he felt the medal could be finished in 18 months, and offered Pistrucci payment if he <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> four apprentices and finish it. Pistrucci declined.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 1943, as the Luftwaffe {{took the}} fight to the bombers flying unescorted over the Reich, Specht scored regularly. Leading by example, he soon {{became one of the}} top Viermot aces {{shooting}} down 14 bombers out of his 18 victories that year. This included his 13th victory on 26 July, during Blitz Week, when bombers targeted the Blohm & Voss U Boat yards in Hamburg and the synthetic rubber factories of Continental AG and Nordhafen in Hanover.; as well a pair on 17 August on the infamous Schweinfurt raid. He was awarded the Ehrenpokal (Goblet of Honour) on 23 August, and the German Cross in Gold on 25 November. Specht became increasingly critical of the relatively weak armament of the Bf 109 during this time. Towards the end of 1943, with longer-ranged fighter-escorts accompanying the Allied bombers, tactics had to change: The single-engined fighters would engage the fighter screen while a Zerstörergruppe <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>on</b> the bombers. Coincidentally, for a while Specht’s II./JG 11 was paired up with his old unit, I./ZG 26.|$|E
