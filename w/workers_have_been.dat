5|$|On Cape Cod, Vonnegut made most of {{his money}} writing pieces for {{magazines}} such as Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post, and Cosmopolitan. He also did a stint as an English teacher, wrote copy for an advertising agency, and opened the first American Saab dealership, which eventually failed. In 1952, Vonnegut's first novel, Player Piano, was published by Scribner's. The novel has a post-Third World War setting, in which factory <b>workers</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> replaced by machines.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of non-citizens are Muslims, though some are Christian Indonesian who are mainly ethnic Florenese and Timorese who arrived since the 1950s. A {{small number of}} Pakistanis lives in the town, mainly working as shop or restaurant owners. Most non-citizens work {{and live in the}} plantations. Some of the migrant <b>workers</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> naturalised as Malaysian citizens. However, there are still many who live without proper documentation as illegal immigrants in the town with their own unlawful settlement.|$|E
5|$|The rate of {{movement}} of workers is associated with temperature, and foraging workers leave the nest after sunrise when the nest is warmed in the early morning. Meat ants emerge and start foraging when temperatures are approximately 14°C (57°F), but {{they are capable of}} withstanding extremely hot temperatures, as <b>workers</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> seen foraging in 43°C (109°F) heat. Workers may only forage for several minutes when soil temperature is well above their thermal limit at 45.8°C (114°F). At 50°C (122°F) (soil surface temperature), foraging activity is reduced even further. As these ants exhibit high running speeds during hot days, their speed decreases after temperatures of 50°C due to the physiological stress put onto them. Workers can withstand such temperatures by exhibiting opportunistic thermal responses to adjust their behaviour in order to handle high trail temperatures and alter their thermal biology for low temperatures. They will also deliberately expose themselves closely to their thermal maxima.|$|E

5|$|While {{pollination}} by ants {{is somewhat}} rare, several Myrmecia {{species have been}} observed pollinating flowers. For example, the orchid Leporella fimbriata is a myrmecophyte {{which can only be}} pollinated by the winged male ant M. urens. Pollination of this orchid usually occurs between April and June during warm afternoons, and may take several days until the short-lived males all die. The flower mimics M. urens queens, so the males move from flower to flower in an attempt to copulate with it. M. nigrocincta <b>workers</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> recorded visiting flowers of Eucalyptus regnans and Senna acclinis, and are considered a potential pollination vector for E. regnans trees. Although Senna acclinis is self-compatible, the inability of M. nigrocincta to appropriately release pollen would restrict its capacity to effect pollination. Foraging M. pilosula workers are regularly observed on the inflorescences of Prasophyllum alpinum (mostly pollinated by wasps of the family Ichneumonidae). Although pollinia are often seen in the ants' jaw, they have a habit of cleaning their mandibles on the leaves and stems of nectar-rich plants before moving on, preventing pollen exchange. Whether M. pilosula contributes to pollination is unknown.|$|E
5|$|While women {{worked in}} coal mines {{elsewhere}} in Britain, {{either on the}} surface or underground, bal maidens worked only on the surface. It is likely that Cornish women had worked in metal mining since antiquity, but the first records of female mine workers date from the 13thcentury. After the Black Death in the 14thcentury, mining declined, and no records of female <b>workers</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> found from then until the late 17thcentury. Industrial improvements, the end of Crown control of metal mines, and rising demand for raw materials caused a boom in Cornish mining in the late 17th and early 18thcenturies. Increasing numbers of women and girls were recruited to the mines from about 1720, processing ore sent up by the male miners underground. The discovery of cheaper sources of copper in North Wales in the 1770s triggered a crash in the copper price, and many mines closed.|$|E
5|$|Green-head ant {{males are}} {{produced}} irregularly {{throughout the year}} and are low-flying ants. Recorded nuptial flights begin between September to November at temperatures of 20–25°C (68–77°F), when a number of males begin to emerge from their nest. Sometimes, however, the males may return to their nest after briefly appearing outside. The green-head ant is a gamergate species, which means that males can successfully mate with the workers. These workers remain outside their nest with their head and thorax appressed and gaster elevated into the air. Observation has shown the workers first attacking the males when the two first encounter each other, followed by the male mounting the worker by grasping it in the cervical region with its mandibles, successfully attaching itself. Both ants usually rest when they mate, but sometimes the workers may groom themselves or move about several moments after, thereby disengaging with the male. On a few occasions, <b>workers</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> seen to move as soon as copulation begins and drag the male, eventually dislodging it. Copulation usually occurs at 8 to 9 in the morning, with pairs lasting for 30 seconds to almost one minute. Most pairs mate once, but others may copulate with each other twice. In some cases, males will successfully mate with two workers, and some pairs may return to their nest while mating.|$|E

25|$|Dolichovespula maculata is {{distributed}} throughout the United States and southern Canada, but is most common in the southeastern United States. Males in this species are haploid and females are diploid. Worker females can therefore lay eggs which develop into males. Matricide might occur after sufficient <b>workers</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> raised and queen-destined eggs have been laid, {{in order to give}} workers a reproductive advantage.|$|E
25|$|In January 2016, Amnesty {{international}} said UAE government {{continues to}} violate rights of migrant {{workers in the}} country.

25|$|When the {{temperature}} of the nest becomes too hot (over 29°C), the queen attempts to fan the nest to bring {{the temperature}} back down. In addition, <b>workers</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> observed to modulate body temperature. As protein content of food sources increase, thoracic temperature increases. Workers collecting high-quality protein had thoracic temperatures 1.98°C higher than workers collecting low-quality protein. A possible explanation is that they modulate thoracic temperatures to increase foraging efficiency.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that workers in reproductive nests may kill their queen so they can reproduce. When researchers at the University of Sheffield examined a collection of nineteen D. maculata nests during the reproductive phase of their life cycle, they found that 14/19 nests did not have a queen. Matricide might occur after sufficient <b>workers</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> raised and queen-destined eggs have been laid. However, matricide has not been directly observed and other causes of death are possible.|$|E

25|$|Historically, a {{ceremonial}} Golden Spike driven by Leland Stanford connected the rails of the First Transcontinental Railroad across the United States. The valuable rail fastening spike represented the merge of the Central Pacific and Union Pacific railroads on May 10, 1869, at Promontory Summit, Utah Territory. The rail spike has entered American popular consciousness in this manner; the driving of the Golden Spike {{was a key}} point {{in the development of}} the western seaboard in North America and was recognized as a national achievement and demonstration of progress.

25|$|The {{domestic}} <b>workers</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{denied the}} right to freedom of association and banned from union membership under Article 92 of the Labour Law, added to which they have almost no legal safeguards which leaves them subject to abuse and exploitation. The decision made by the Lebanese forbidding the domestic workers forming their own union or being a member of one would be considered a violation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) which Lebanon ratified in 1972 and entered into force in 1976. Article 22 of ICCPR stipulates that “Everyone shall have the right to freedom of association with others, including the right to form and join trade unions for the protection of his interests.”.|$|E

25|$|To address prawn farm {{issue the}} Jagannathans {{organised}} {{the whole of}} LAFTI's village movement to raise awareness among the people to oppose the prawn farms. Since 1993, the villagers have offered Satygraha (non-violent resistance), through rallies, fasts, and demonstrations in protest of establishing the prawn farms. They have been beaten up by hired goons, their houses have been burnt, and LAFTI <b>workers</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> imprisoned, because of false accusations of looting and arson. Undeterred by this, Jagannathan filed a 'public interest petition' in the Indian Supreme Court, which in turn asked NEERI (National Environmental Engineering Institute of India) to investigate the matter. NEERI's investigation report highlighted the environmental cost of the prawn farms to the nation and recommended all prawn farms within 500 meters of the coast to be banned. In December 1996 the Supreme Court issued a ruling against intensive shrimp farming in cultivable lands within 500 meters of the coastal area. It is said {{that because of the}} prawn farmers' local political influence, the Supreme Court judgement was not implemented on the ground. The legal battle around the prawn farms is still not resolved and the Jagannathans continue their struggle to establish non-exploitative, eco-friendly communities in the coastal areas of Tamil Nadu.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} for migrant domestic workers in Lebanon is grim, as the circumstances for {{them are not}} improving; the migrant domestic <b>workers</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> subjected to violations of their freedom of movement and their right to residency. In early 2014, the general security began deporting children of migrant workers with {{one or both of}} their parents. The justification for this move was that the migrants were in Lebanon to work and not create families, it is worthy to note that the implementation of these deportations had been put on hold after pressure from civil society organisations like Insan. By the summer of 2015, the decision to expel migrant domestic workers and their children had been overturned. However, things did not get better for the migrant domestic workers; they now had to deal with tighter control over residency permits. The general security which is the body legally mandated to deal with foreign workers has refused to re-grant some workers their permits on the grounds of refusing to reside with their employees. Despite the fact that the general security exercises force on migrant domestic workers and their presence in the country, this is in fact in violation with the Lebanese legal international commitment, constitution and national laws.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} several costs {{associated}} with circular migration. One of these is brain drain, where a migrant who migrates because of skills or education creates a loss of human resources {{in the country of}} origin. These highly skilled workers are in demand in the more developed countries, where in some areas the barriers to immigration have been reduced to allow for both permanent and temporary migration. At the same time, barriers against unskilled <b>workers</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> strengthened. The ability to use skills also varies and can constitute a cost to the migrant and the economy, If the migrants had unskilled jobs while working abroad, they will have little experience that will {{contribute to the development of}} their home country upon return. Additionally, even if the worker learned new technical or industrial skills, they may not be able to use them if their country of origin does not have the infrastructure or institutional framework to support them. Circular migration also has a social impact on the families of migrant workers. If labor migrants have children, these minors may be temporarily abandoned while their parents are abroad working. This issue is problematic and some authorities have begun to formulate policies to monitor the situation.|$|E
