500|$|Back to the Future spent 11 {{weeks at}} number one. Gale {{recalled}} [...] "Our second weekend {{was higher than}} our first weekend, which is indicative of great word of mouth. National Lampoon's European Vacation came out in August and it kicked us out of number one for one week and then <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>back</b> to number one." [...] The film went on to gross $210.61 million in North America and $173.2 million in foreign countries, accumulating a worldwide total of $383.87million. Back to the Future had the fourth-highest opening weekend of 1985 and was the top-grossing film of the year. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 59 million tickets in the US.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} notable for its sheer {{amount of water}} and its lack of bright lighting. Director Rob Bowman noted {{that he did not}} film [...] "{{anything}} for that episode during daylight, or with anything brighter than a flashlight or an emergency lamp in the hallway". [...] Bowman explained that [...] "Agua Mala" [...] was extremely difficult to film because every time a crew or cast member got wet, they [...] "had to stop everything to dry them off". Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny, in particular, were [...] "water-logged" [...] for a majority of the episode's filming. Anderson later joked, [...] "I mean, we got drenched. It was like <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>back</b> in Vancouver!" [...] The show had previously filmed in Vancouver from season one to five before moving to Los Angeles, California, {{at the beginning of the}} sixth season.|$|E

500|$|The Swarm {{received}} mixed {{response in}} its opening season. The park declared the attraction a commercial disappointment in its following years, after disappointing guest attendance to the park; this partially {{led to the}} brief [...] "Brave it backwards" [...] feature in 2013. Blogger Nick Sim of [...] "Theme Park Tourist" [...] praised the attraction, saying that it packs [...] "a number of incredible elements into its compact circuit". Sim stated the ride had [...] "fallen just short of our sky-high expectations" [...] mainly because of [...] "its short ride time". He rated the ride 4 out of 5. Joanna Churchill of the Daily Mirror gave {{a review of the}} backwards ride, stating that it is [...] "a whole new adrenaline-pumped experience that is simply not for the faint-hearted". Churchill stated that her [...] "blood pressure and heart rate went through the roof", but [...] "there was barely time to process what was happening before <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>back</b> on terra firma".|$|E
500|$|After {{working for}} twenty {{months at the}} war front, in September 1919 Banker {{and the rest of}} her team {{returned}} home. General Edgar Russel, chief signal officer of the AEF, extolled their service as [...] "indispensable". Reminiscing about her wartime experience as chief operator, Banker humorously noted that [...] "an afternoon in the switchboard office sometimes sounded like a scene from Alice in Wonderland, where only the initiated can make sense of the proceedings". She also noted the confidentiality aspect of her assignment when she was tested by an intelligence officer about her ability to keep a secret, which was about her posting out of the unit. About her work at the war front she said that [...] "the secrecy surrounding their operations gave it an aura of romance and set it apart from the civilian work". After returning from the war front with her team, she reflected: [...] "We missed the First Army with its code of loyalty and hard work. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>back</b> in the petty squabbles of civilian life where even chief operators had 'tantrums' and where the wives of civilians attached to the Peace Conference spilled all over Paris in Army cars." ...|$|E

[...] Westfall also said once the band return home from touring, they were [...] "going to drop everything and start writing and doing pre-production full time." [...] At this point, the band had ten songs and were trying to condense them into five, then planning to write five more. Westfall said the band completed the final [...] "few songs when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>back</b> home with Tom (Denney) and Chad (Gilbert)." [...] On the pace of writing, McKinnon said: [...] "It seems like a really fast thing that has happened but we've been constantly working on it the entire time." [...] On the songs themselves, he said: [...] "the pop-punk stuff has a darker edge to it. I wrote it like that, it's still pop-punk but with a darker edge". The album was influenced by Finch's What It Is to Burn (2002). The album [...] "came together song by song" [...] as McKinnon mentioned, with the band coming up with 15–16 song ideas. McKinnon stated in an {{interview with}} Rocksound that there's songs [...] "that didn't make this record that we're saving." [...] There is a track on the album that was previously written for Homesick.|$|E

500|$|The video premiered on March 14, 2008 on AOL's The Boot. It commences with Swift and {{her best}} friend in a grey 2009 Ford Mustang GT 45th Anniversary Edition, parked behind a tree. Swift reminiscences, looking at a {{photograph}} of her and her ex-boyfriend together, and states, [...] "Would you look at how happy <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>back</b> then? I can't believe {{he turned out to be}} such a jerk." [...] Anderson is then seen ogling outside the window with binoculars, and spots Swift's ex-boyfriend and another woman arriving in a black late 90s ford f150 pick-up truck. She notes the other woman in driving the truck, and Swift states angrily he never allowed her to drive it. As Swift's ex-boyfriend and the woman start frolicking inside the truck, and the music begins and the music video transcends to a concrete room where the singer (clothed by a grey, one-shoulder mini-dress and black leather, thigh-length boots) is playing an electric guitar, alongside her backup band. During [...] "Picture to Burn"'s chorus, fire ignites behind them. Afterwards, the band is depicted entering a house furtively, using flashlights. Swift is sitting on a brown couch, sporting a black tank top, black leather pants, and beehive hair, as the band ransacks the house. They throw darts at photographs of him, envelop all of his furniture with toilet paper, mess his mirror with the word [...] "loser", lick his utensils and spit into his mouthwash. Suddenly, the ex-boyfriend and the woman are shown approaching the house, and, seeing this, Anderson informs them of it via handheld transceiver. He enters the house and discovers it was ransacked, and repeats the word [...] "Taylor". The video then transitions to Anderson and Swift inside the Ford Mustang, with Anderson also repeating [...] "Taylor". She then suggests leaving, and Swift says, [...] "You know what? I'm over it." [...] The video concludes with the photograph of Swift and her ex-boyfriend in flames, thrown in the sidewalk. Cut-scenes feature Swift and her band performing in the concrete room, Swift singing on the couch, or Swift dancing affront a shower of sparks. To date, the video has 96 million views on YouTube.|$|E

2500|$|In {{defining}} conservatism, Reagan said: [...] "If you {{analyze it}} I believe {{the very heart}} and soul of conservatism is libertarianism. I think conservatism is really a misnomer just as liberalism is a misnomer for the liberals—if <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>back</b> {{in the days of the}} Revolution, so-called conservatives today would be the Liberals and the liberals would be the Tories. The basis of conservatism is a desire for less government interference or less centralized authority or more individual freedom and this is a pretty general description also of what libertarianism is." [...] Reagan's views on government were influenced by Thomas Jefferson, especially his hostility to strong central governments. [...] "We're still Jefferson's children," [...] he declared in 1987. He also stated, [...] "Freedom is not created by Government, nor is it a gift from those in political power. It is, in fact, secured, more than anything else, by limitations placed on those in Government". Likewise he greatly admired and often quoted Abraham Lincoln.|$|E

2500|$|The Cirith Ungol stair ledge {{was built}} as a wet weather set on a squash court in a hotel in Queenstown. In November 24 1999, Sean Astin's close-ups in the Cirith Ungol set were shot in the filming of the first Return of the King shots. Andy Serkis (Gollum) had not been cast yet. The set {{remained}} standing on the squash court and it wasn't until a year later on November 30th, 2000, that Elijah Wood's first close-ups were actually shot on that ledge. This would become a general failsafe measure if the weather disrupted the shooting schedule. On Wood and the second Cirith Ungol shoot, Peter Jackson stated, [...] "A year later, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>back</b> in the squash court, {{and this time the}} heat was on Elijah. He had to get his head back into a scene that had been half-filmed so long ago.
