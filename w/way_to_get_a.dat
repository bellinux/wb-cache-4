25|$|In July, Hulk Hogan, {{alongside}} Sting, began feuding with {{a mysterious}} group of masked men, who had dubbed themselves the Aces & Eights. The group's attack on Hulk Hogan on the July 12 episode of Impact Wrestling {{was used to}} write Hulk Hogan off the show, as he was set to undergo another back surgery. On the August 16, 2012 episode of Impact, Hogan hired Taryn Terrell, as the referee for the TNA Women's Knockout Championship match between Madison Rayne and Miss Tessmacher. In November, Hogan would move into a storyline with her father and Bully Ray after Austin Aries revealed a secret relationship between herself and Ray. After seeing them kissing in a parking garage on the December 20 episode of Impact Wrestling, Hulk suspended Ray indefinitely on the January 3, 2013, episode. The following week, after Ray saved Hogan from a kidnapping by the Aces & Eights, Hogan accepted his marriage proposal much to her father's dismay. The ceremony took place the next week on Impact Wrestling, where Ray's groomsman Tazz interrupted and revealed {{himself to be a}} member of Aces & Eights, leading to the group attacking Ray, Hulk Hogan, and the rest of the groomsmen. On the February 21 edition of Impact, after listening to Hogan plea, Hulk Hogan named Bully Ray the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship at Lockdown. At this event, Bully Ray would turn his back on Hogan and TNA by revealing himself as the President of the Aces & Eights. On the following episodes of Impact, Bully Ray touted the fact that the public bought into his deceptive act the entire time to earn the trust of Sting, Hogan, and Hulk Hogan as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> chance to capture the TNA World Title. Hogan continued to seek a divorce from her husband and got it ending the storyline. On August 16, 2013 it was reported that Hogan had been released from TNA.|$|E

[...] He still makes custom knives available for sale at knife shows, but takes no orders for new custom work. Since 1995 the only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> new custom knife from Emerson himself is through a lottery held at knife shows where he is present. Depending {{on the size of}} the show, as many as several hundred potential buyers write their names on individual pieces of paper at his booth, and at a predetermined time a name is drawn.

500|$|A big celebration {{was held}} on January 14, 1914, to commemorate the arrival of {{electrical}} power, {{the addition of a}} water tank and supply system for indoor pumping and a new park for South Jordan. [...] By the 1930s, the area needed a water tank to store water for residents living further west. [...] The only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> federal grant was to incorporate and become a city. [...] Citizens voted to incorporate on November 8, 1935, and immediately issued bonds to obtain money for the water tank. [...] The city was initially governed by a Town Board with responsibilities over parks, water and the cemetery. [...] In 1978, the city moved to a mayor-council form of government and assumed local supervision of police, fire, road and building inspections from Salt Lake County.|$|E

500|$|The Manhattan Project {{had been}} a crash program to produce a nuclear weapon. Along the way, {{promising}} ideas had been set aside. Norris Bradbury, who replaced J. Robert Oppenheimer {{as director of the}} Los Alamos National Laboratory in late 1945, revived such projects in order to entice scientists to remain at, or return to, Los Alamos. One of these projects was the [...] "Super", a nuclear weapon using nuclear fusion, which Edward Teller's F-1 group had worked on under Fermi's direction. The technical problem was figuring out a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> fusion reaction to initiate and propagate, which required temperatures attainable only with a fission bomb. The hydrodynamic calculations involved were daunting, and ENIAC was used to run a computer simulation of the Super in December 1945 and January 1946.|$|E
500|$|Technical {{director}} Lisa Forsell {{explained that}} {{to enhance the}} richness and beauty of the desert landscapes surrounding Radiator Springs, the filmmakers created a department responsible for matte paintings and sky flats, saying: [...] "Digital matte paintings are a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> lot of visual complexity without necessarily having to build complex geometry, and write complex shaders. We spent a lot time working on the clouds and their different formations. They tend to be on several layers and they move relative to each other. The clouds do in fact have some character and personality. The notion was that just as people see themselves in the clouds, cars see various car-shaped clouds. It’s subtle, but there are definitely some that are shaped like a sedan. And if you look closely, you’ll see some that look like tire treads. The fact that so much attention is put on the skies speaks to the visual level of the film. Is there a story point? Not really. There is no pixel on the screen {{that does not have}} an extraordinary level of scrutiny and care applied to it. There is nothing that is just throw-away." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the final}} game of the month Vancouver played the Rangers and former coach Alain Vigneault. Daniel Sedin said of the game: [...] "I know our former coach is over there, but once you get into the game you're not going to think too much about it. He was with us for seven years and he meant a lot to this franchise, so it's going to be fun seeing him again but once the game gets going we want the two points, and so does he". Tortarella stated: [...] "I'm not going to lie, it's a little weird for me coming back, but once the game starts, it's about playing and trying to find a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> win". The Canucks lost the game 5–2, {{finishing}} the month with 31 points, four points out of the final playoff spot.|$|E

2500|$|A {{relatively}} simple <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> first-order approximation of delta-v {{is based on}} the 'Patched Conic Approximation' technique. One must choose the one dominant gravitating body in each region of space through which the trajectory will pass, and to model only that body's effects in that region. [...] For instance, on a trajectory from the Earth to Mars, one would begin by considering only the Earth's gravity until the trajectory reaches a distance where the Earth's gravity no longer dominates that of the Sun. [...] The spacecraft would be given escape velocity to send it on its way to interplanetary space. [...] Next, one would consider only the Sun's gravity until the trajectory reaches the neighbourhood of Mars. [...] During this stage, the transfer orbit model is appropriate. [...] Finally, only Mars's gravity is considered during the final portion of the trajectory where Mars's gravity dominates the spacecraft's behaviour. [...] The spacecraft would approach Mars on a hyperbolic orbit, and a final retrograde burn would slow the spacecraft enough to be captured by Mars.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is unknown}} whether {{the origins of}} the {{practice}} are purely superstitious. Hall of Famer Denis Potvin says that the Islanders of the 1980s would [...] "play four games in five nights in the first round and it was just something that kind of happened." [...] The 1980 Islanders included two Swedish players (Stefan Persson and Anders Kallur), so it is possible that tennis champion Björn Borg's custom of not shaving his beard during Wimbledon, which he had been doing for several years by that time, was an influence on the start of the practice in hockey. Some players have said the beard is both a reminder of team unity and a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> player thinking about the playoffs from the moment he looks in the mirror in the morning. The 2009 Red Wings used the slogan [...] "The beard is back" [...] for the final series of their 2009 Stanley Cup playoffs run. They played the Pittsburgh Penguins in the Stanley Cup Final that year (won by Pittsburgh) in which most of the players (and the owner of the team, Mario Lemieux) grew beards as well.|$|E

They set to acquire War-Steeds from the friendly Rohirrim {{in the town of}} Langhold.

After departing the town of Faldham, where Elfhelm's son Elfmar rules in his father's absence at the Fords of Isen, they make their way to Eaworth in the Entwash Vale, near the edge of Fangorn Forest. Horn's father Ingbert is the Reeve - ruler - of this town and the vale itself, but is not pleased to see his son, for Horn had a term to serve in the town of Stangard, which he now broke. Adding more tension is the fact that Horn and Nona, despite all their differences, have begun to show signs of affection for each other during the long journey, but few in Eaworth are even being able to tolerate to presence of a [...] "wild Dunlending" [...] among them. Offended by such welcome, Nona leaves silently and without saying goodbye. Unable to find her trail, the player, Corudan and Horn {{have no choice but to}} continue with their original mission.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the last}} notable {{philosophers}} to accept something like the Aristotelian [...] "common sense" [...] was Descartes in the 17th century, but he also undermined it. He described this inner faculty when writing in Latin in his Meditations on first philosophy. The common sense is {{the link between the}} body and its senses, and the true human mind, which according to Descartes must be purely immaterial. Unlike Aristotle, who had placed it in the heart, by the time of Descartes this faculty was thought to be in the brain, and he located it in the pineal gland. Descartes' judgement of this common sense was that it was enough to persuade the human consciousness of the existence of physical things, but often in a very indistinct <b>way.</b> <b>To</b> <b>get</b> <b>a</b> more distinct understanding of things, {{it is more important to}} be methodical and mathematical. This line of thought was taken further, if not by Descartes himself then by those he influenced, until the concept of a faculty or organ of common sense was itself rejected.René Descartes is generally credited with making obsolete the notion that there was an actual faculty within the human brain that functioned as a sensus communis. The French philosopher did not fully reject the idea of the inner senses, which he appropriated from the Scholastics. But he distanced himself from the Aristotelian conception of a common sense faculty, abandoning it entirely by the time of his Passions of the Soul (1649).|$|E
