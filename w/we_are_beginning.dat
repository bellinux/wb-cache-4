5|$|Modern Shift: In today’s society, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> {{to see a}} {{shift in}} gender {{representation}} in the media particularly in the male fashion industry. Fashion designers are now starting to blur the lines between masculinity and femininity. In the first advertisement, the male has a very soft delicate hold on the rose compared to the typical aggressive grip men exhibit in ads. In the other two examples, both men are not only portraying the idea of feminine touch but the concept of self-touch as well.|$|E
25|$|Clearly, SA has far {{reaching}} applications, as it {{is necessary}} for individuals and teams to function effectively in their environment. Thus, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> to see SA going beyond the field of aviation to work being conducted {{in a wide variety of}} environments. Currently, SA is being studied in such diverse areas as air traffic control, nuclear power plant operation, vehicle operation, and anesthesiology.|$|E
500|$|His {{policies}} have been praised by some other world leaders and {{are seen as a}} model for at least one country. In response to a question about Belarus's domestic policies, President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela said [...] "We see here a model social state like the one <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> to create." [...] Chairman of the Chinese Standing Committee of National People's Congress Wu Bangguo noted that Belarus has been rapidly developing under Lukashenko. Lithuanian MPs have also praised the Belarusian economy and its contribution to the Lithuanian economy; Stanislovas Gedraitis said that he was in awe of the Belarusian progress created mostly by the efforts of the national leader.|$|E

6000|$|As we rushed {{down the}} ravine {{we could see}} clearly all before us. But [...] now, just as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> to fear lest some mischance might [...] allow {{some of them to}} reach the glade, there was another cause of [...] surprise--of rejoicing.|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> to descend. In the {{distance}} below us already twinkled {{the lights in}} the solitary rancho of Lone Valley. I turned to my companion. [...] "But you have forgotten that I don't even know your name. What am I to call you?" ...|$|R

2500|$|The paranormal {{interpretation}} of OBEs {{has not been}} supported by all researchers within the study of parapsychology. Gardner Murphy (1961) wrote that OBEs are [...] "not very far from the known terrain of general psychology, which <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> to understand more and more without recourse to the paranormal".|$|E
2500|$|Interventions, {{like the}} TOP-100 poets that DAS GEDICHT {{identified}} {{by way of}} a commission, headed by 50 major literary critics, poets, editors, and literary scholars, have made DAS GEDICHT not only an internationally recognized publication for poetry, but also a model for successfully raising cultural awareness of poetry. With respect to the success of DAS GEDICHT, the [...] put for the question: “What is going on with the reading humanity? Why can't they suddenly be without poetry?” With DAS GEDICHT in view, the critic and member of the Group 47, , said in the Bayerischer Rundfunk: “Suddenly, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> to understand how important poetry can be.” ...|$|E
5000|$|We trained hard ... but {{it seemed}} that every time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> to form up into teams <b>we</b> would <b>be</b> reorganized.

60|$|Looking {{at it now}} I can {{see that}} the days which {{followed}} Audrey's arrival at Sanstead marked the true beginning of our acquaintanceship. Before, during our engagement, <b>we</b> had <b>been</b> strangers, artificially tied together, and she had struggled against the chain. But now, for the first time, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> to know each other, and were discovering that, after all, we had much in common.|$|R

2500|$|At {{the first}} Deputies Committee meeting on {{terrorism}} held in April 2001, Clarke strongly {{suggested that the}} U.S. put pressure on both the Taliban and Al-Qaeda by arming the Northern Alliance and other groups in Afghanistan. Simultaneously, that they target bin Laden and his leadership by reinitiating flights of the MQ-1 Predators. To which Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz responded, [...] "Well, I just don't understand why <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> by talking about this one man bin Laden." [...] Clarke replied that {{he was talking about}} bin Laden and his network because it posed [...] "an immediate and serious threat to the United States." [...] According to Clarke, Wolfowitz turned to him and said, [...] "You give bin Laden too much credit. He could not do all these things like the 1993 attack on New York, not without a state sponsor. Just because FBI and CIA have failed to find the linkages does not mean they don't exist." ...|$|E
2500|$|By putting ten {{questions}} to General Mulcahy on 28 April, Seán McEntee {{argued that the}} Army Executive had acted continuously on its own to create a republic since 1917, had an unaltered constitution, had never fallen {{under the control of}} the Dáil, and that: [...] "the only body competent to dissolve the Volunteer Executive was a duly convened convention of the Irish Republican Army" [...] – not the Dáil. By accepting the treaty in January and abandoning the republic, the Dáil majority had effectively deserted the Army Executive. In his reply, Mulcahy rejected this interpretation. Then, in a debate on defence, McEntee suggested that supporting the Army Executive [...] "... even if it meant the scrapping of the Treaty and terrible and immediate war with England, would be better than the civil war which <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> at present apparently." [...] McEntee's supporters added that the many robberies complained of by Mulcahy on 26 April were caused by the lack of payment and provision by the Dáil to the volunteers.|$|E

6000|$|The {{big event}} filled us {{young people with}} talk, too. We let it flow in a steady stream while we tended the flocks. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> to feel pretty {{important}} now, for I was eighteen and the other youths were from one to four years olderyoung men, in fact.

50|$|When <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> to {{work out}} the songs for Sunday Mornings, my friend Dave Gibbs, {{formerly}} of Gigolo Aunts and now Low Stars, said ‘Why don’t you record ‘You Can’t Count On Me’?’ I told him I {{had no idea what he}} was talking about. He said it was one of his favorite songs of mine and sent me an mp3 of my original demo.|$|R
50|$|We trained hard, but {{it seemed}} that every time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> to form up into teams <b>we</b> would <b>be</b> reorganized. Presumably the plans for our {{employment}} were being changed. I was to learn later in life that, perhaps because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> so good at organizing, we tend as a nation to meet any new situation by reorganizing; and a wonderful method it can be for creating the illusion of progress while producing confusion, inefficiency and demoralization.|$|R

60|$|As we strolled on, {{climbing}} up higher and higher, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> continually bringing neighboring peaks into view and lofty prominence {{which had been}} hidden behind lower peaks before; so by and by, while standing before a group of these giants, we looked around for the chalet again; there it was, away down below us, apparently on an inconspicuous ridge in the valley! It was as far below us, now, {{as it had been}} above us when <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> the ascent.|$|R
6000|$|... "I can see nothing," [...] said Edwin, [...] "except {{that the}} guard and fireman are both looking back as {{if they wanted to}} see {{something}} on the line. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>beginning</b> to slow, however, being not far from the station now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's the uselessness of it, {{for this}} age," [...] she exclaimed. [...] "I think clergymen don't {{understand}} the harm {{it is doing}} in concentrating the attention on such a vulnerable and non-essential point. Those {{of us who are}} striving to reorganize our beliefs and make them tenable, do not bother our heads about miracles.

And isn't it by his very individuality that we are able to recognize Jesus to-day?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Glenn Tillbrook {{said of the}} song, [...] "It's {{slightly}} grandiose-sounding, {{which is}} not my cup of tea really. On the whole it's not a bad version.It's a bit like Bruce Springsteen's 'Born to Run'. And yet another song about drinking." [...] Chris Difford said, [...] "'I've Returned' could have been on East Side Story. It's a lyric that reflects our early writing, so I suppose <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>beginning</b> to repeat ourselves. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> cocooned {{in a web of}} touring and it was suffocating our skills. We didn't have any time to observe.|$|R
5000|$|In recent times, {{a popular}} quotation, {{actually}} written by Charlton Ogburn in 1957, on reorganization is often spuriously {{attributed to a}} Gaius Petronius.

One evening <b>we</b> <b>were</b> sitting, rather disconsolately, in our room, and I was reading out the advertisements of country board in a newspaper, when in rushed Dr. Heare--one of our old friends. He was so full of something that he had to say that he didn't even ask us how <b>we</b> <b>were.</b> In fact, he didn't appear to want to know.|$|R
