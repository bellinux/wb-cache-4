50|$|One of the {{purposes}} of this protected area is to provide a sanctuary for Nearctic migratory birds, as it is a unique habitat on almost 2000 km of coast on the Pacific Ocean. A total of 200 species of resident and migratory birds {{can be found in the}} park including: the grey gull, the sanderling, the Black skimmer, Belcher's gull, the kelp gull, the Grey-headed gull, the White-tufted grebe, the Great grebe, the <b>White-cheeked</b> <b>pintail,</b> the Cinnamon teal, the Common moorhen, the Virginia rail, the Cocoi heron, the Snowy egret, the Little blue heron, the Chilean flamingo, among others.|$|E
5000|$|Rábida (Jervis) Island - It {{bears the}} name of the convent of Rábida, where Columbus left his son during his voyage to the Americas. It has an area of 4.9 km2 (1.9 sq mi) and a maximum {{altitude}} of 367 m (1,204 ft). The high amount of iron contained in the lava at Rábida gives it a distinctive red colour. <b>White-cheeked</b> <b>pintail</b> ducks live in a saltwater lagoon close to the beach, where brown pelicans and boobies have built their nests. Until recently, flamingos were also found in the lagoon, but they have since moved on to other islands, likely {{due to a lack of}} food on Rábida. Nine species of finches have been reported in this island.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, an {{environmental}} and cultural resource survey of Culebrita {{was carried out}} by Southeastern Archaeological Research (SEARCH) of Jonesville, Florida and Ellis Environmental Group, LC, in conjunction with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Huntsville in order to identify “cultural resources, sensitive habitats, and endangered plants and animals that may exist” on Isla Culebrita. During the survey, a total of 97 plant species were recorded, none of which are state or federally threatened or endangered species. In addition, 32 birds, 4 reptiles, and 2 mammals were recorded. Of these animals, one federally endangered species, the brown pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis) and one threatened species, the <b>white-cheeked</b> <b>pintail</b> (Anas bahamensis) were observed. Endangered green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) were also observed on the island.|$|E

This tribe includes all of the 2 ̆ 2 puddle ducks 2 ̆ 2 that constitute most of the important game species throughout the world. Of the 39 species making up the tribe, all but 3 can readily {{be placed in the}} single genus Anas. The tribe has a worldwide distribution, with some of the species occurring on several continents and having extensive transcontinental migration patterns. However, most of the species are temperate-breeding forms and are generally adapted to shallow, marshy habitats where food can be obtained from near the surface by dabbling or tipping-up. In most species the males have fairly elaborate and colorful breeding plumages, whereas the ground-nesting females are mostly cryptically patterned with buff and brown. In nearly all species both sexes have iridescent wing speculum markings, and in all species the trachea has an enlarged bulla at the syrinx. Pair bonds are generally reformed each year during the nonbreeding season, but in some species with long breeding seasons the pair bonds are relatively permanent and the males remain with their offspring and help to protect them...|$|E
