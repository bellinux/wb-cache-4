40|$|Industrial {{technology}} programs {{around the}} country must {{be sensitive to the}} demands of manufacturing and industry as they continue to replace “vocational” curriculum with high-tech alternatives. This article examines whether or not teaching oxyacetylene welding in the industrial technology classroom is required to learn arc welding processes. The results of this study suggests that there appears to be little impact, in terms of gas metal arc welding skills, associated with removing oxyacetylene welding from the curriculum. Because the gas metal arc welding industry is growing globally and industrial technology curricula are under time constraints that often limit the amount of time devoted to welding, faculty should consider suspending oxy-fuel welding to allow more time in gas metal arc <b>welding</b> <b>instruction...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{mastering}} 1 F (flat position-fillet) welds on carbon steel using a sequenced pattern of welding was examined. Participants (N = 71) {{were randomly assigned}} a specific sequence of welding between Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW) and Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW). The hypothesis of teaching beginning welders the GMAW process before the SMAW process to improve the ability to master American Welding Society (AWS) welds was tested. A welding pretest was administered to determine any prior welding knowledge. Sixty minutes of <b>welding</b> <b>instruction</b> taught proper welding safety, machine set-up, arc length, travel speed, work angle, and correct bead formation. Two practice sessions of 60 minutes were given for participants {{to become familiar with}} each welding process, followed by two testing sessions of ten minutes. During the testing period, individuals were assessed on their ability to produce an AWS 1 F (flat position- fillet) lap weld in a given sequence. Welds were graded according to the AWS rubric for fillets with a total of four criteria categories based on the following criteria: a) presence of cracks or porosity, b) complete fusion, c) fillet leg size is specified minimum, and d) undercut - not to exceed 1 / 32 inches. The study indicate that students perform welds that meet AWS quality standards when using the GMAW process, however, the results were not statistically significant...|$|E
40|$|In the {{beginning}} of steel structure buildings, riveted joint was a normal method, but {{by the development of}} high thickness and high strength of the steel, the joint method with high tension bolt had becoming used. Recently, the joint methods with both of high tension bolt and welded joint have been taken. The followings are found to be apparent. 1. Each fabricator's welders, who have welder's license, have much experience. 2. Because each fabricator has very few <b>welding</b> engineers, the <b>instruction</b> for the <b>welding</b> technique is not enough. For example, the control of steel material and welding rods, groove form of joint and the strain of welded products. 3. The inspection of welded parts is dealt by each fabricator. In fact only 10 percents of the parts are inspected. 4. The welding defect, especially undercut, is found in the parts of the welded joint between pillar and beam...|$|R
