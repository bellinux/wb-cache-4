5|$|In 1999, Herren {{signed to}} the British label Warp under two aliases, Prefuse 73 and Savath & Savalas, after Warp staff {{had heard a}} {{previous}} record of Herren's which had sparked their interest in his work. Herren {{was familiar with the}} label through artists Aphex Twin and Boards of Canada, but chose to sign to Warp as he was a fan of the group Broadcast who had released an EP through the label. Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives features rapping from Mikah 9, Aesop Rock and MF Doom, and vocals from Sam Prekop of the indie rock band the Sea and Cake. The vocalists did not work directly with Herren, but sent him audio tapes of their own vocal recordings. Herren later commented on having Prekop sing on the album, noting that having an indie rock artist on the album <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> of trying to get his sound out to a new audience.|$|E
5|$|In August 1914, aged 16, {{shortly after}} the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Ponticelli {{was assigned to the}} 4th Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment of the French Foreign Legion. He had lied about his age to enlist. He rediscovered his older brother, Céleste Ponticelli, who had joined the same regiment. According to Ponticelli, France had done much for him, and serving <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> of showing his gratitude. He served at Soissons in Picardy, northeast France, and at Douaumont, near Verdun. Ponticelli worked at digging burial pits and trenches. In keeping a promise to Céleste to always assist others, he rescued a German and a French soldier who were wounded in the arm and leg, respectively.|$|E
25|$|Chuck's {{philosophy}} was to convince every {{guy on the}} team that his role was important. If you came in {{as a free agent}} and were just a gunner on the punt team or the third safety, you were doing something the team needed to win...It <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> of emphasizing that no one is irreplaceable. You have to coach everybody the same way. If Joe Greene goes out, Steve Furness goes in and we're not going to change anything. Chuck never panicked when someone got hurt or held out. We can still function. That made a big impression on me.|$|E

500|$|During the Vietnam War, Deep Throat {{worked for}} the Central Intelligence Agency. When a UFO was shot down over Hanoi by US Marines, the {{surviving}} extraterrestrial was brought to Deep Throat, who executed it. He later claimed that his assisting Mulder <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> of atoning for his actions. He also stated that he was [...] "a participant {{in some of the}} most insidious lies and witness to deeds that no crazed man could imagine".|$|E
500|$|Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) tells Hurley that James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway) has {{the flight}} {{manifest}} from the plane, {{and that could}} help him take the census. Sawyer uncharacteristically gives it to Hurley without any objection. While Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) tries to help Claire {{move back to the}} beach, she starts having contractions. Charlie says he can deliver the baby, but after he accidentally confesses that he is a recovering drug addict, she yells at him to get Jack, which leaves her alone in the jungle. Charlie finds Ethan and tells him that Claire is in labor and to get Jack. Charlie goes back to comfort Claire, who tells him the story about the psychic. Charlie suggests that the psychic knew the flight was going to crash, and this <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> of forcing Claire to raise the baby by herself. Claire stops having contractions.|$|E
500|$|The New York Tribune quoted Armstrong's {{response}} that the rumors were [...] "frivolous and utterly false". Immediately below the quote from Armstrong {{was a different}} twist on the rumor from San Francisco, also dated July 16, and printed as fact. Sourced to [...] "a number {{of the most prominent}} planters and merchants from the Sandwich Islands", it alleged a scheme by the King and Celso Caesar Moreno to import 1,000,000 Chinese men (but no women), conferring instant citizenship upon them, and reaping a $7 per head tax. The 1878 census population count for the entire kingdom had been only 57,985. As the tale went, Kalākaua would then hand the deed to the islands over to the Chinese government. The slant on that story was that Kalākaua's tour <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> of getting out of town after the plan backfired when vetoed by the Hawaiian government.|$|E

500|$|Entertainment website Bollywood Hungama {{reported}} that Kalki Koechlin {{was set to}} star in Menon's upcoming film. The published reports revealed that Koechlin would be {{playing the role of}} the young, brash, and social-media-savvy Tara Deshpande. Koechlin's co-star from That Girl in Yellow Boots (2011) and Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara (2011), Naseeruddin Shah, joined the cast after he was approached by Menon, who sent him the film's script in an e-mail. Shah, who did not have any prior knowledge of Menon's work, accepted the male lead role in the film. To prepare for the role, Koechlin worked on the dialect in which her character spoke, an amalgamation of Hindi and English. She also dyed her hair black for the role, as Menon wanted her to look more [...] "earthy". In an interview with Gulf News, Koechlin said she loved the film's vibe and compared it to the American drama Lost In Translation (2003). In a separate e-mail interview with Arti Daniel of The Khaleej Times, Shah said that Waiting <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> of making up to the audience for the spate of [...] "ghastly movies" [...] that he did in 2014.|$|E
2500|$|Moore {{said that}} Thompson, [...] "fearing that I would not obey his order, decided to {{threaten}} other state officials and {{force them to}} remove the monument if I did not do so. A threat of heavy fines <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> of coercing obedience to that order," [...] an action that Moore sees {{as a violation of}} the Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution.|$|E
2500|$|The {{lettering}} of {{the middle}} two lines was in reverse {{so that it could}} be read in the mirror.

[...] When asked about its meaning during the Motorcycle Mania II program in 2001, Larry explained with a big grin on his face, “...it’s my philosophy. Go through life see what’s up. Try not to kill nobody!” [...] Larry often expressed his belief that life is [...] "a really precious, short gift." ...|$|E

2500|$|King {{was able}} to draw well, and {{continued}} to draw throughout his life. Vincent Alessi notes of King’s European drawings that “the drawings are not merely documentary sketches of places visited. Rather they quietly scratch the surface, capturing the rhythm, heart and sensibilities of a location and its people. It is this aspect that best reveals King’s humanity”. Jane Eckett says that: “For Grahame King drawing represented much more than simply a means of describing the world. It <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> of learning about the world, synthesizing observation, thought, feeling and intuition.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The Sun Dance is a Lakota {{religious}} ceremony. [...] "Only a {{very brave}} warrior became {{a candidate for}} the Sun Dance, for it meant giving his own body in supreme sacrifice. He must endure the greatest physical pain to ensure that his prayers would be answered. [...] These prayers were to prevent tribal famine or the death of a dear one, or that could bring fortitude in facing immense odds in impending battle or help on behalf of a friend deemed more valuable than himself. [...] It <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> of offering all he had, his own body. [...] After being fastened to the Sun Dance pole by long leather thongs that passed through the flesh of his chest, the participant danced for three or four days without food, water or sleep." ...|$|E
2500|$|One {{night on}} tour in 1945, Tallchief was doing her barre when Balanchine remarked [...] "if only you {{would learn to}} do battement tendu {{properly}} you wouldn't have to learn anything else." [...] It <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> of saying she needed to start all over– battement tendu is the most basic ballet exercise there is. [...] "I wanted to die", she recalled. [...] "But I had seen the difference between Mary Ellen's [...] dancing and mine. I knew he was right." [...] Under the tutelage of Balanchine, Tallchief lost ten pounds and elongated her legs and neck. She learned how to hold her chest high, keep her back straight, and keep her feet arched. [...] "My body {{seemed to be going}} through a metamorphosis", she recalled. Tallchief relearned the basic exercises the way Balanchine wanted and transformed her greatest weakness–turnout–into a strength. Danilova devoted a lot of her time to instructing Tallchief in the ballerina's art, helping her transform from a teenage girl into a young woman.|$|E

2500|$|Pip, saddened, runs to tell Miss Havisham, only to {{find that}} she approves of Steve. Miss Havisham is glad that Estella has broken Pip's heart and she {{explains}} that she has Estella break men's hearts to use their tears to power her [...] "Genesis Device". She desires youth and wants to use the device to switch bodies with Estella. She then uses robot monkeys to attack Pip. Pip escapes and falls unconscious, awakening at an old house with Joe and Pocket. The anonymous person who sent Pip to London is revealed to be the escaped convict Pip met {{at the beginning of the}} story. Because of Pip's kindness, the convict led a life of goodness and became a millionaire. Sending Pip to London <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> of repaying Pip for the good that Pip did for him.

2500|$|Also in 1987, Orbison was {{inducted}} into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and initiated into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Bruce Springsteen, who concluded his speech with a reference to his own album [...] "Born to Run": [...] "I wanted a record with words like Bob Dylan that sounded like Phil Spector—but, most of all, I wanted to sing like Roy Orbison. Now, everyone knows that no one sings like Roy Orbison." [...] In response, Orbison asked Springsteen for a copy of the speech, and said of his induction that he felt [...] "validated" [...] by the honor. A few months later, Orbison and Springsteen paired again to film a concert at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles. They were joined by Jackson Browne, T Bone Burnett, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Bonnie Raitt, Jennifer Warnes, James Burton, and k.d. lang. Lang later recounted how humbled Orbison had been by the display of support from so many talented and busy musicians: [...] "Roy looked at all of us and said, 'If there is anything I can ever do for you, please call on me'. He was very serious. It <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> of thanking us. It was very emotional." [...] The concert was filmed in one take and aired on Cinemax under the title it was released on video by Virgin Records, selling 50,000 copies.|$|E
2500|$|Lisa {{is invited}} to join the school debate team, but soon discovers that she faces {{prejudice}} from the brunette supremacist judges because she has blonde hair. This prejudice follows her during the town meeting when Cletus mocks her concerns over the freedom infringement. Marge's attempt to comfort her fails, and Lisa hears Bart make comments against blondes even though Bart himself is blonde. When she calls him out for being prejudice against blondes, Bart defends himself by pointing out how the dumb blonde-stereotype mostly just applies to women and girls, while men and boys with blonde hair are expected to be evil and conniving rather than unintelligent. In a moment of kindness, Bart admits that he knows Lisa is the only exception to the blonde stereotype and this <b>was</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> of encouraging her to continue her fight against it. Dyeing her hair brown, [...] a newly determined Lisa deliberately presents a weak argument at the next debate meeting in favor of school uniforms and conformity. Nevertheless, she receives praise from the judges and earns the wrath of her rival, Megan, who realizes that because Lisa is now a brunette, she has levelled the playing field. Lisa is horrified when she learns the judges agreed with her simply because of her darker hair and not the strength of her debate skill. She points out their bias toward brunettes, prompting the only female judge on the panel to proudly admit her belief in the blonde stereotype. Her confession wound up embarrassing the other male judges who tried to earlier convince Lisa that her argument was strong in support of school uniform and didn't unanimously vote just because she was brunette. Lisa urges the audience not to blindly follow stereotypes as they all have exceptions. She uses herself being an intelligent blonde and nearby Comic Book Guy being obese, but very miserly as prime examples. However, one of her claims - that not all old people are bad drivers - is immediately undermined when Grampa Simpson crashes his car through the wall of the school gymnasium where the debate is being held. In spite of the setback, many are encouraged by Lisa to look past the stereotypes and Megan appears to have lost the debate because she could no longer take advantage of the stereotypes.|$|E
