Henry's preceding speech to Suffolk, where he demands Suffolk not look at him, and then immediately demands that he <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> into Suffolk's eyes was played by Alan Howard {{in such a way as}} to suggest that Henry was losing his grip on reality, and in response to this, Mirren played the speech in such a way as to engage Henry's mind in the here and now, focus his thoughts and prevent them drifting away.|$|E

Regarding the previous statement, the singer said she wanted people to understand that she was normal, and how they could relate to her. Tisdale titled the album Headstrong, because she calls herself a [...] "headstrong" [...] type of person, commenting that she was the term in the sense of knowing how she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>look,</b> sing, and come across.

500|$|However, Becky and Steve {{decide to}} adopt, in a storyline which was {{originally}} meant for Liz McDonald (Bev Callard). It {{was revealed that}} Becky was given the storyline because producer Kim Crowther was determined to feature such a plot. Becky does not like the idea at first thinking she would make a bad mother, later changing her mind. The storyline saw various character changes implemented to Becky, in real life Kelly was forced to reduce {{the length of her}} hair. This was written into scripts to fit with the adoption storyline, which saw Becky changing her wardrobe to fool social workers. Of this Kelly stated: [...] "With the adoption storyline, she borrows Claire Peacock's clothes for a while because she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> good for the social worker coming round. We {{thought it was a good}} opportunity for her to have a slight image change." [...] Kelly further spoke of her admiration of her characters former image adding: [...] "I love Becky with long hair and if it could have been possible I'd have kept her with long blonde hair forever but sometimes nature and practicalities take over!" ...|$|E
500|$|Stevie's {{relationship}} with Olly is complicated and he treats her badly, but she ignores his flaws and holds onto any nice thing he does, however small. When he ends their relationship, Stevie is heartbroken, alone and lost, {{and does not}} fit in. She invites Asher to stay and is surprised when he brings Sol and Naz as well, but because Stevie loves to make new friends, she reacts in a way most people would not in that situation. She builds relationships with them and they grow to love her eventually. Fairbank-Hynes commented: [...] "Sol, Naz and Asher inform her about {{the real world and}} help her harden up just enough to survive in Albert Square!" [...] Stevie starts to see her new friends as the family she always wanted, but it proves to be difficult as they all have family issues of their own. Stevie <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after her new friends, which confuses them. The actress described the four friends as an unlikely gang, and said her favourite scenes were when Stevie and Sol caused a blackout across Albert Square, as the two characters did not have much interaction before then. Thompson described Stevie as a [...] "fish out of water", and Hussen said Stevie starts off being unappreciated, but eventually her friends see that she is important to them.|$|E

Novakovic said that they [...] "bring out the worst in each other" [...] and added [...] "I don't think she could find a guy that would tolerate her like Andrew does. She thinks he's the only guy she could possibly be with." [...] Natasha thinks that school and studying is not cool and is happy that Andrew feels the same, until Summer Hoyland joins their class and Andrew becomes interested in his studies. Natasha fears that she could lose her control over Andrew. Summer later asks Natasha {{if there is anything}} else, other than the physical aspect, to her relationship with Andrew. Novakovic says that [...] "Natasha is furious, but it does make her stop and think about what she is doing." [...] Natasha does begin to have her doubts about the relationship and she decides to test Andrew, by telling him she wants their relationship to have to be about communicating and understanding each other. Andrew does not take the new direction of the relationship well. Novakovic said that Natasha believes the relationship between her neighbours, Susan (Jackie Woodburne) and Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), is something to be inspired by. She added [...] "That's what she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> forward to, but she's getting way ahead of herself. Andrew likes her but he isn't as serious as she is." [...] Novakovic opined that Andrew and Natasha [...] "bring out the worst in each other" [...] and that Natasha's relationship with Andrew had been one of her favourite storylines.|$|E

500|$|Stevie is {{the privately}} educated {{daughter}} of rich parents, who have abandoned {{her to go}} travelling. [...] She {{is said to be}} clueless about real life, with her profile on the official E20 website describing her as generous, creative and unlucky in love, though she has a boyfriend. Although she is described as posh, Fairbank-Hynes said Stevie is not just like a posh girl in East London, but would be out of place anywhere as she is in her own world. Fairbank-Hynes opined that posh characters in Walford stand out and can bring comedy to the show. Stevie is very naive and, according to Fairbank-Hynes, [...] "away with the fairies"—the most naive person anyone could meet. However, writer Emer Kenny was worried that Stevie being [...] "away with the fairies" [...] would make her unrealistic, but said that Fairbank-Hynes made the character recognisable. Because of Stevie's naivety and her kind nature, people see this as an invitation to take advantage of her. Stevie does not understand why people are cruel to her because she sees the good in them and <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after them, be around people and mother them. Fairbank-Hynes commented, [...] "Stevie's {{the type of person who}} thinks a stranger is a friend she hasn't met yet". However, Stevie is very forward, which can scare people away. She is also creative, empathetic and a complete daydreamer who lacks common sense but has bursts of assertiveness and intelligence, which can surprise people. Thompson said that Stevie has a good balance as she can be ditzy but also quite smart. Fairbank-Hynes identified with the character's mad outbursts, innocence and daydreaming, and also said Stevie is quirky, lovely and eccentric. Her daydreaming can lead people to believe she is a bimbo, but she is not.|$|E
500|$|Susan meets Jim at the {{hospital}} and remembers him from the work he did on Lyn Scully's (Janet Andrewartha) house. They get talking and Jim reveals he just had a melanoma removed and he is a bit [...] "bewildered" [...] by {{the hospital}} process and Susan helps him out. Jim's condition grows worse and he is diagnosed with terminal cancer. Susan learns he has no family and Woodburne said she instinctively <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> after him. The actress said Susan crosses boundaries as she starts to neglect certain areas of her life, like her marriage. She tells Karl not to be selfish and that the situation is not about him or her, it is about Jim. Woodburne explained to Channel 5 that Karl's reaction to Susan's friendship with Jim changes and he starts thinking he should not be selfish. However, when he notices his wife becoming more involved with Jim and neglecting her responsibilities, Karl gets angry as she is not thinking about anything else. Susan and Karl's eldest son, Malcolm, returns to Erinsborough to help his parents work through their issues. Woodburne thought Malcolm was initially on Susan's side because he can see she is helping someone who is ill, but as he looks more closely he understands why his father is so upset with Susan's behavior. Susan is upset when she misses Jim's last moments and blames Karl. They begin rowing, which becomes worse due to Susan's grief. Susan Hill of the Daily Star revealed Karl and Susan were to separate following a make-or-break holiday. Their decision leaves Malcolm devastated and he takes his anger out on his mother, but Karl then admits it was his decision to end the marriage. Woodburne said the Jim Dolan plot was [...] "a tremendous story which highlighted problems with Susan and Karl's marriage." [...] The actress said the storyline was challenging to play because it was emotional and she had to slap Fletcher. Of Susan's future, Woodburne said [...] "2012 will be a huge year of adjustment for Susan. She is now single and moves into an apartment of her own – and she has to find her own way. She discovers things about herself that will surprise people." ...|$|E

Teen Vogue writer Casey Lewis said, [...] "But if she <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> good for us, she certainly succeeds...Actually good is an understatement". According to Geller, Gomez was as involved in the clip's overall intimacy as Muller, and her portrayal was [...] "well-played". Geller lauded the visual as [...] "a masterpiece of suggestion", saying that although Gomez's shower scene was [...] "PG-13", it was [...] "still sexy enough to make any respectable fan's tongue hang out". Francesca Bacardi of E! said Gomez should permanently choose her [...] "absolutely gorgeous" [...] natural look sported in the clip.|$|E

2500|$|Tiffany was {{described}} as a [...] "practical feminist" [...] who would always get her man. James explained the description, saying: [...] "She wants to further her own goals, but she's not afraid of using her femininity to do so. She wants equality, but she recognises {{there is a difference between}} men and women and how they operate. She <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> good and wear make-up and she can get very emotionally entangled sometimes." [...] She has also landed the label of a [...] "hot party girl". Tiffany's rivalry with Emily helped James understand Tiffany's characterisation, she stated; [...] "It challenged Tiffany. She always expects people to want to be beautiful. It showed me the naivete about Tiffany that I hadn't seen before. She assumes that she knows how everyone thinks and what everyone else wants from life, but then you realise she's possibly quite skewed and self-centred. It's obviously such a big part of Tiffany's life that it over-rides everything else. She's not brainless, it's just her priorities. James described her as, [...] "very heroic" [...] and believed that she, [...] "always puts up a fight for the underdog." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{terms of}} Web 2.0's social impact, critics such as Andrew Keen argue that Web 2.0 {{has created a}} cult of digital narcissism and amateurism, which {{undermines}} the notion of expertise by allowing anybody, anywhere to share and place undue value upon their own opinions about any subject and post any kind of content, regardless of their actual talent, knowledge, credentials, biases or possible hidden agendas. Keen's 2007 book, Cult of the Amateur, argues that the core assumption of Web 2.0, that all opinions and user-generated content are equally valuable and relevant, is misguided. Additionally, Sunday Times reviewer John Flintoff has characterized Web 2.0 as [...] "creating an endless digital forest of mediocrity: uninformed political commentary, unseemly home videos, embarrassingly amateurish music, unreadable poems, essays and novels... mistakes, half truths and misunderstandings". In a 1994 Wired interview, Steve Jobs, forecasting the future development of the web for personal publishing, said [...] "The Web is great because that person can't foist anything on you - {{you have to go}} get it. They can make themselves available, but if nobody <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> at their site, that's fine. To be honest, most people who have something to say get published now."
