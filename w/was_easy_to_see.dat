5|$|The inputs {{operated}} by the bomb-aimer's mate drove a mechanical calculator inside the console, or computor. The output of the calculator drove flexible shafts that rotated the sight head to the proper angles in azimuth and altitude, representing the wind drift and range angle. The sight head replaced the older wire crosshairs with a modern reflector sight that <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> at night. The sight could be rotated manually to view objects well {{in front of the}} aircraft, allowing the bomb aimer to select among a wider variety of objects to use for drift measurements.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers also {{compared}} Firefly to Whedon's other series, Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Chocano {{noted that}} the series lacks the psychological tension of Buffy, and suggests {{that this might be}} attributable to the episodes being aired out of order. MSN, on the other hand, pointed out that after viewing the DVD boxed set it <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> why the program had attracted many die-hard fans. [...] "All of Whedon's fingerprints are there: the witty dialogue, the quirky premises and dark exploration of human fallacy that made Buffy brilliant found their way to this space drama".|$|E
500|$|The {{essential}} {{idea here}} is intuitive and probably qualifies as folk wisdom. [...] It was articulated by Kurt Vonnegut in his 1961 short story Harrison Bergeron. In Vonnegut’s futuristic dystopia, the Handicapper General uses {{a variety of}} handicapping mechanisms to reduce inequalities in performance. [...] A spectator at a ballet comments: [...] "it <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{that she was the}} strongest and most graceful of all dancers, for her handicap bags were as big as those worn by two hundred pound men." [...] Zahavi interpreted this analogy to mean that higher quality peacocks with bigger tails are signalling their ability to [...] "waste" [...] more of some resource by trading it off for a bigger tail. This resonates with Thorstein Veblen's idea that conspicuous consumption and extravagant status symbols can signal wealth.|$|E

500|$|By 1964, {{the country}} was a {{constitutional}} monarchy ruled by Sultan Jamshid bin Abdullah. Zanzibar had a population of around 230,000 Africans—some of whom claimed Persian ancestry and were known locally as Shirazis—and also contained significant minorities in the 50,000 Arabs and 20,000 South Asians who were prominent in business and trade. The various ethnic groups were becoming mixed and the distinctions between them had blurred; according to one historian, an important reason for the general support for Sultan Carbou was his family's ethnic diversity. However, the island's Arab inhabitants, as the major landowners, were generally wealthier than the Africans; the major political parties were organised largely along ethnic lines, [...] with Arabs dominating the Zanzibar Nationalist Party (ZNP) and Africans the Afro-Shirazi Party (ASP). The ZNP looked towards Egypt as its model, which caused some tensions with the British colonial officials, but Zanzibar had been for centuries dominated by its Arab elite, and the Colonial Office could not imagine a Zanzibar ruled by the blacks. After Zanzibar had been conquered by the Sultanate of Oman in 1698, all {{of the land in}} the countryside had been given to Omani aristocratic families, whose descendants still owned the land in 1964. Though not all of the Arabs were as wealthy as the families who owned the clove and coconut plantations, the resentment felt by the poor African farmers who worked the plantations acquired a racialized tinge, especially as in a small island like Zanzibar, it <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the contrast in wealth between the land-owning Arab families and their poor African tenants.|$|E
2500|$|Duran Duran {{were among}} the first bands to have their videos shot with a {{professional}} movie camera on 35mm film, rather than on videotape, making them look superior to many of the quickly shot videos which had been MTV staples until then. MTV provided Duran Duran with access to American radio markets that were unfriendly to British music, new wave music, or [...] "anything with synthesisers". Because MTV was not available everywhere in the United States at first, it <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a pattern: where MTV went, listener demand for Duran Duran, Tears for Fears, Def Leppard and other European bands with interesting videos went through the roof.|$|E
2500|$|When used together, the SB-300 {{receiver}} and SB-400 transmitter could transceive and had many other {{features of the}} S/Line, including crystal bandwidth filters and 1kHz tuning dial resolution. They could also operate separately (if the optional crystal pack was installed in the transmitter), giving the operator more flexibility in talking to foreign stations who could not transmit in the same range as the U.S. stations could. The S/Line influence <b>was</b> <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> too, in its cabinet styling, tuning mechanism and knobs. [...] But by designing them as kits and using less expensive construction, Heathkit could offer these units at much lower prices. [...] The pair sold for $590 that first year (equivalent to about $ today). [...] The matching SB-200 1200-watt input/700-800-watt output linear amplifier completed the line for 1965.|$|E
