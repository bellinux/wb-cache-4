5|$|In the quarter-finals, Bayern Munich {{were drawn}} against Group F winners and fellow German side Kaiserslautern, while Manchester United were paired <b>with</b> <b>Group</b> C winners Internazionale. Two Dwight Yorke goals gave United a 2–0 win {{in their first}} leg at Old Trafford, while Bayern beat Kaiserslautern by the same {{scoreline}} at the Olympiastadion through goals from Élber and Effenberg. In the second leg, Nicola Ventola pulled a goal back for Inter, but Paul Scholes secured United's passage to the semi-finals with a late away goal. Meanwhile, Bayern won convincingly at Kaiserslautern, as goals from Effenberg, Carsten Jancker, Mario Basler and an own goal from Uwe Rösler gave them a 4–0 win, 6–0 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Locating prey: The wolves {{travel in}} search of prey through their power of scent, chance encounter, and tracking. Wolves {{typically}} locate their prey by scent, though they must usually be directly downwind of it. When a breeze carrying the prey's scent is located, the wolves stand alert, and point their eyes, ears and nose towards their target. In open areas, wolves may precede the hunt <b>with</b> <b>group</b> ceremonies involving standing nose-to-nose and wagging their tails. Once concluded, the wolves head towards their prey.|$|E
5|$|Members of Picidae are {{typically}} monogamous, {{with a few}} species breeding cooperatively and some polygamy reported in a few species. Polyandry, where a female raises two broods with two separate males, has also {{been reported in the}} West Indian woodpecker. Another unusual social system is that of the acorn woodpecker, which is a polygynandrous cooperative breeder where groups of up to 12 individuals breed and help to raise the young. Young birds from previous years may stay behind to help raise the group's young, and studies have found reproductive success for the group goes up <b>with</b> <b>group</b> size, but individual success goes down. Birds may be forced to remain in groups {{due to a lack of}} habitat to disperse to.|$|E

5|$|Strep throat {{is spread}} by {{respiratory}} droplets from an infected person.

5|$|The 13 {{teams were}} drawn into four groups, <b>with</b> <b>Group</b> 1 {{containing}} four teams, {{and the others}} containing only three. Each group played a round-robin format, with two points awarded for a win and one point for a draw. If two teams had tied on points to win a group, a play-off would {{have been used to}} decide the group winner; however, this was not necessary. The four group winners progressed to the knockout semi-final stage. Extra time was available in the knockout matches if the two teams were level after ninety minutes, but it was not required.|$|E

At {{the end of}} the group stage, the teams who {{finished}} bottom of their group were eliminated, along with the two teams above them (in Group A), and the team above them (in Group B), whereas the teams positioned in the top two slots in the groups progressed to the knock-out rounds. Due to there being an odd number of teams, Group A contained more matches and an additional team, with a total of 5 to Group B's 4 teams.|$|E

50|$|Today it is {{well known}} that persons <b>with</b> blood <b>group</b> AB can accept {{donations}} of the other blood groups, and that persons <b>with</b> blood <b>group</b> O can donate to all other groups.Individuals <b>with</b> blood <b>group</b> AB are referred to as universal recipients and those <b>with</b> blood <b>group</b> O are known as universal donors.These donor-recipient relationships arise due to the fact that type O blood possesses neither antigens of blood group A nor of blood group B. Therefore, the immune systems of persons <b>with</b> blood <b>group</b> A, B or AB do not refuse the donation.Further, because persons <b>with</b> blood <b>group</b> AB do not form antibodies against either the antigens of blood group A or B, they can accept blood from persons <b>with</b> these blood <b>groups,</b> besides from persons <b>with</b> blood <b>group</b> O.|$|R

5|$|A {{study of}} {{vigilance}} behaviour of herds revealed that individuals on {{the borders of}} herds {{tend to be more}} cautious; vigilance decreases <b>with</b> <b>group</b> size. Group size and distance from roads and bushes were found to have major influence on vigilance, more among the grazing springbok than among their browsing counterparts. Adults were found to be more vigilant than juveniles, and males more vigilant than females. Springbok passing through bushes tend to be more vulnerable to predator attacks as they can not be easily alerted, and predators usually conceal themselves in bushes. Another study calculated that the time spent in vigilance by springbok on the edges of herds is roughly double that spent by those in the centre and the open. Springbok were found to be more cautious in the late morning than at dawn or in the afternoon, and more at night than in the daytime. Rates and methods of vigilance were found to vary with the aim of lowering risk from predators.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table published by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, thorium and the rare-earth elements were placed outside {{the main body of}} the table, at the end of each vertical period after the alkaline earth metals. This reflected the belief at that time that thorium and the rare-earth metals were divalent. With the later recognition that the rare earths were mostly trivalent and thorium was tetravalent, Mendeleev moved cerium and thorium to group IV in 1871, which contained the modern carbon group (group 14), titanium group (group 4), cerium, and thorium, because their maximum oxidation state was +4. Cerium was soon removed from {{the main body of the}} table and placed in a separate lanthanide series; thorium was left <b>with</b> <b>group</b> 4 as it had similar properties to its supposed lighter congeners in that group, such as titanium and zirconium.|$|E
