5|$|Linezolid is metabolized in the liver, by {{oxidation}} of the morpholine ring, without {{involvement of}} the cytochrome P450 system. This metabolic pathway leads to two major inactive metabolites (which each account for around 45% and 10% of an excreted dose at steady state), one minor metabolite, and several trace metabolites, none of <b>which</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> more than 1% of an excreted dose. Clearance of linezolid varies with age and gender; it is fastest in children (<b>which</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> the shorter half-life), {{and appears to be}} 20% lower in women than in men. There is a strong correlation between linezolid clearance and creatinine clearance (CLCR).|$|E

40|$|This {{instrumental}} study {{aimed to}} replicate the exploratory {{factor analysis of the}} Referential Thinking Scale (REF) which has been carried out in other research studies. The REF consists of 34 items which assess the frequency of referential thinking on a dichotomic scale (True/False). The analyzed data come from a sample of 193 participants (67. 36 % women, mean age 28. 36 years, SD = 10. 35), 131 of whom were patients. By means of the Principal Component Analysis method and varimax rotation, five factors were identified that <b>account</b> <b>for</b> 37. 35 % of the variance of rotated factor solution. The five factors were labelled as: Laughing, Commenting (<b>which</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> 8. 92 % of variance); Guilt, Shame (<b>which</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> 8. 77 % of variance); Causal Explanations (<b>which</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> 7. 17 % of variance); Songs, Newspapers, Books (<b>which</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> 6. 44 % of variance); and Attention, Appearance (<b>which</b> <b>accounted</b> <b>for</b> 6. 04 % of variance). These results confirm the multidimensionality of the REF scale since the same five factors as in previous studies were isolated...|$|R

5|$|Carbohydrates make up {{the bulk}} of the fruit bodies, {{comprising}} 9.23% of the fresh weight (see table), and 65.4% of the dry weight. The carbohydrate component contains the monosaccharides glucose, mannitol and α,α-trehalose, the polysaccharide glycogen, and the water-insoluble structural polysaccharide chitin, <b>which</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> up to 80–90% of dry matter in mushroom cell walls. Chitin, hemicellulose, and pectin-like carbohydrates—all indigestible by humans—contribute to the nutritionally desirable high proportion of insoluble fibre in B.edulis.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{may have}} bred C.cartwrightianus {{specimens}} by screening for specimens with abnormally long stigmas. The resulting saffron crocus was documented in a 7th-century BC Assyrian botanical reference compiled under Ashurbanipal, {{and it has}} since been traded and used {{over the course of}} four millennia and has been used as treatment for some ninety disorders. The C.sativus clone was slowly propagated throughout much of Eurasia, later reaching parts of North Africa, North America, and Oceania. Global production on a by-mass basis is now dominated by Iran, <b>which</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> some 90% of the annual harvest.|$|E
5|$|Most birds can fly, which distinguishes {{them from}} almost all other {{vertebrate}} classes. Flight {{is the primary}} means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for searching for food and for escaping from predators. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (<b>which</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, {{as well as a}} modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil.|$|E

5|$|Platinum is {{a member}} of the {{platinum}} group of elements and group 10 of the periodic table of elements. It has six naturally occurring isotopes. It is one of the rarer elements in Earth's crust, with an average abundance of approximately 5μg/kg. It occurs in some nickel and copper ores along with some native deposits, mostly in South Africa, <b>which</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> 80% of the world production. Because of its scarcity in Earth's crust, only a few hundred tonnes are produced annually, and given its important uses, it is highly valuable and is a major precious metal commodity.|$|E
5|$|Since 1990 {{the total}} number of hours flown {{annually}} by the GA sector has remained in the range 1.25–1.35million, the dominant sector being traditional GA flying, <b>which</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> 0.6million per year. An overall increase in aircraft numbers combined with nil growth in hours flown has brought the annual average utilisation per aircraft down from 157 hours in 1984 to 103 hours in 2002. The decline in asset utilisation has led to speculation that the economic health of the GA industry is weakening, though the lack of data on profitability makes this difficult to confirm.|$|E
5|$|Svalbard has {{permafrost}} and tundra, {{with both}} low, {{middle and high}} Arctic vegetation. 165 species of plants have been found on the archipelago. Only those areas which defrost in the summer have vegetations, <b>which</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> about 10% of the archipelago. Vegetation is most abundant in Nordenskiöld Land, around Isfjorden and where affected by guano. While there is little precipitation, giving the archipelago a steppe climate, plants still have good access to water because the cold climate reduces evaporation. The growing season is very short, and may last only a few weeks.|$|E

Most of the forested land is on the watershed's southern and eastern edges, but there are some patches of it elsewhere, most of which are fairly small. Most of the developed land is near Jerseytown and Washingtonville, but there are several other small areas of development in the watershed's lower reaches and a few other areas in its upper reaches.|$|E

5|$|Already {{suffering}} from food shortages {{due to a}} five-month drought, President Fidel Castro announced {{that the government would}} supply people under the age of 14 and those over 60, <b>which</b> <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> roughly 36% of Cuba's population, with extra food aid. An estimated 156,000 tonnes of food was set aside for this action and the food was worth several million dollars. People who qualified for the aid would receive 4.4lbs (2kg) of rice and peas if they lived in western Cuba and 6.6lbs (3kg) if they lived in eastern Cuba per month until July 1999. The United Nations World Food Program provided $20.5million in aid for both the effects of the drought and Georges. By December, the Cuban Government requested $90million to help recover from the hurricane and drought. By this time, about $40million had already been set aside for the same reason. The Cuban Red Cross supplied shelter for more than 92,000 residents and supplied them with hygiene kits, food, water, and other relief materials.|$|E
