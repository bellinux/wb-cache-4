50|$|Whether the Journal can {{properly}} <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> a novel {{has been}} disputed.

One modern literary critic has asserted that 'the invented detail is... small and inessential', while Watson Nicholson - writing in 1919 - argued that the work can <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> 'authentic history'. Other literary critics have argued that the work can indeed <b>be</b> <b>regarded</b> <b>as</b> a work of imaginative fiction, and thus can justifiably be described as a 'historical novel'.|$|R
