5|$|Often {{categorized}} as a rationalist philosopher, Wollstonecraft demonstrates {{her commitment to}} and appreciation of feeling in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. She argues that subjective experiences, such as the transcendent emotions prompted by the sublime and the beautiful, possess a value equal to the objective truths discovered through reason. In Wollstonecraft's earlier works, reason was paramount, because it allowed access to universal truths. In Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, however, reason serves {{as a tool for}} reflection, mediating between the sensual experiences of the world and an abstract notion of truth (not necessarily universal truth). Maturation is not only the acquisition of reason—the view Wollstonecraft had adopted in Original Stories from Real Life (1788)—but also an understanding of <b>when</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> trust one's emotions.|$|E

50|$|Scholar {{and activist}} Obioma Nneaemeka {{identifies}} an emerging feminist engagement particular to African countries that {{is evident in}} this film. Nneameka names this specific form of feminism as “nego-feminism” where the prefix, nego, signifies negotiation {{and the elimination of}} unyielding self-righteousness, or “no ego.” In this respect, this feminist engagement is deeply rooted in humility without seeming docile. Nnaemeka explains that this feminist practice “knows <b>when,</b> where, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> detonate patriarchal land mines; it also knows <b>when,</b> where, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> go around negotiate with or negotiate around patriarchy in different contexts.” To that end, nego-feminism is fundamental to Johnson-Sirleaf political manoeuvres.|$|R
25|$|Most major {{diseases}} {{have established}} diagnostic criteria and/or clinical prediction rules. The establishment of diagnostic criteria or clinical prediction rules {{consists of a}} comprehensive evaluation of many tests that are considered important in estimating {{the probability of a}} condition of interest, sometimes also including how to divide it into subgroups, and <b>when</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> treat the condition. Such establishment can include usage of predictive values, likelihood ratios as well as relative risks.|$|E
25|$|At the {{earliest}} stage, this basic principle {{applied only to}} the relation between longa and breve. Beginning with Franco of Cologne, the same pattern was also applied between breves and semibreves, and finally, with Philippe de Vitry's theory of the Ars nova, it was taken yet another level down, to the newly introduced minims. From that time onwards, imperfection and alteration could happen {{on the level of}} breves and semibreves whenever the piece was in tempus perfectum, and it could happen between semibreves and minims if the piece was in prolatio maior. The divisions below the minim were invariably binary. Theorists developed an intricate set of precedence rules for <b>when</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> apply imperfection, together with a complex terminology for its different types.|$|E
25|$|At the Manor Christmas party, Will {{once again}} sees Dawson and Old George {{who seem to}} know him well. Miss Greythorne and Merriman debate about <b>when</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> {{approach}} Will about his destiny. Maggie Barnes (Amelia Warner), an attractive local girl appears at the party and Will becomes upset {{when one of his}} older brothers approaches her and begins chatting to her. Will leaves the Manor, and an ominous figure mounted on a white horse and accompanied by dogs chases Will. As the ominous figure prepares to kill Will, who is currently no match for him, Miss Greythorne, Merriman, Dawson, and Old George suddenly appear and save Will. Merriman names the threatening figure as The Rider (Christopher Eccleston), who warns them all that in five days' time his power – The Dark – will rise. The four adults are the last of the Old Ones – ancient warriors who serve The Light – and take Will on a walk through time and space to a place called the Great Hall, which in the present day is the church the Stantons attend. Will is the last of the Old Ones to have been born: he is the seventh son of a seventh son whose power begins to ascend on his fourteenth birthday, though Will disputes this idea because he believes he is the sixth son. Will is The Seeker: the sign-seeker who must locate six Signs whose possession will grant The Light power over The Dark. The Rider is also seeking them. Will returns home to his attic room and falls and twists his ankle. The doctor who calls is The Rider in disguise but he is recognized by Will. The Rider demonstrates his powers on Will’s ankle by alternately healing it and making it much worse before restoring it to its injured state; he offers Will the chance to have any desire he wants fulfilled in exchange for giving him the signs. Will discovers he has a lost twin brother named Tom, who, as a baby, mysteriously disappeared one night and was never found. Merriman instructs Will on his powers, which include sensing the Signs, summoning superhuman strength, commanding light and fire, telekinesis, stepping through time, and the unique knowledge to decipher an ancient text in the Book of Gramarye. Unfortunately, Will learns he can't fly, a power he wanted.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} days of colonization, many European {{settlers}} were subject to food shortages, disease, and attacks from Native Americans. Native Americans were also often at war with neighboring tribes and allied with Europeans in their colonial wars. At the same time, however, many natives and settlers came to depend on each other. Settlers traded for food and animal pelts, natives for guns, ammunition and other European wares. Natives taught many settlers where, <b>when</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> cultivate corn, beans and squash.

500|$|Operation Deny Flight, {{and other}} NATO {{operations}} during the Bosnian War, resulted in significant tension within NATO and the Atlantic relationship.

[...] Disagreements between the United States and its European allies over <b>when</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> use air power [...] "made intra-alliance diplomacy more problematic" [...] during the period.

500|$|Thompson and Doran {{discussed}} {{how much of}} the love stories to depict, as the male characters spend much of the novel away from the Dashwood sisters. The screenwriter had to carefully balance the amount of screentime she gave to the male leads, noting in her film production diary that such a decision would [...] "very much lie in the editing." [...] Thompson wrote [...] "hundreds of different versions" [...] of romantic storylines. She considered having Edward re-appear midway through the film before deciding that it would not work as [...] "there was nothing for him to do." [...] Thompson also opted to exclude the duel scene between Brandon and Willoughby, which is described in the novel, because it [...] "only seemed to subtract from the mystery." [...] She and Doran agonised about <b>when</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> reveal Brandon's backstory, as they wanted to prevent viewers from becoming bored. Thompson described the process of reminding audiences of Edward and Brandon as [...] "keeping plates spinning".|$|E
500|$|Many {{guidelines}} and testing procedures have strict procedures for disclosure and confidentiality to allow individuals to decide <b>when</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> receive their results {{and also to}} whom the results are made available. Financial institutions and businesses {{are faced with the}} question of whether to use genetic test results when assessing an individual, such as for life insurance or employment. The United Kingdom's insurance companies have agreed that until 2017 they will not use genetic information when writing insurance policies under , but Huntington's is explicitly excluded from this agreement. [...] As with other untreatable genetic conditions with a later onset, it is ethically questionable to perform pre-symptomatic testing on a child or adolescent, as there would be no medical benefit for that individual. There is consensus for testing only individuals who are considered cognitively mature, although there is a counter-argument that parents have a right to make the decision on their child's behalf. With the lack of an effective treatment, testing a person under legal age who is not judged to be competent is considered unethical in most cases.|$|E

FOX's Reilly was also initially concerned about the parallel universe aspect, but as the show progressed into the first season and found its groove, the concept was readily accepted.

500|$|The World Ends with You was {{developed}} by the same team that created the Kingdom Hearts series, with input from Jupiter, the company that developed [...] The development of the game started {{two and a half years}} before its Japanese release, during the development of Kingdom Hearts II and the end of development of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories. At that time, Nintendo had announced the DS, but it was not yet on the market; Square Enix asked the team to make a game specifically for the handheld system. The creative team—consisting of Tatsuya Kando (director), Tomohiro Hasegawa (co-director), Takeshi Arakawa (planning director), and Tetsuya Nomura (character design)—were able to experience the DS during the [...] "Touch DS" [...] event in November 2004. From this demonstration, they had envisioned a version of Chain of Memories in which the card game aspects would be present on the bottom screen and an action role-playing game on the top. As they continued to work on the game, the developers realized that they wanted to use the touchscreen more, to make [...] "a game that can only be played on the DS". However, they also encountered the problem that by focusing heavily on the touchscreen, the top screen would be ignored. From this, the idea of the dual screen battle system arose. Several other options were explored for the top-screen game, including command-based battles or a music game, but once they reviewed the game from the eyes of the player, they ultimately settled on the card-game approach with the player having the option to control the game if they wanted to. Even with the completion of the Japanese version of the game, the team felt the dual screen system was too much for overseas audiences, and attempted to change the card-game mechanic into a special meter that would fill up with normal attacks from Neku, but this was not completed in time for release. However, the team was able to alter the [...] "information overload" [...] of the numerous tutorials at the start of the game in the North American release, reducing the amount of text presented as well as allowing the tutorials to be skipped. The [...] "Active Encounter" [...] system, the ability for the player to select <b>when</b> <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> go into battle, {{was developed}} specifically to avoid the issues of [...] "grinding" [...] that are common with most standard RPG systems. While they included the mechanics of being able to scan non-playable characters to see their thoughts, the team was not able to integrate this mechanic more into the game.|$|E
