500|$|Honeychile Rider is one {{of three}} women in the Bond canon who have been scarred by rape. This follows a pattern where the women Bond comes across are somehow {{different}} to the norm, although Black points out that this gives Bond an opportunity to help and save both Rider and the others. Other female characters in the Bond series have flaws, and Rider has a broken nose—the result of the rape she suffered. The cultural historians Janet Woollacott and Tony Bennett, in their analysis of the roles of women in the Bond novels, consider that Rider is [...] "not archetypically feminine", but is [...] "constructed according to the formula 'equal but yet subordinate'." [...] Rider is described in the book as having buttocks like a boy, which brought a response from Fleming's friend Noël Coward that [...] "I was also slightly shocked by the lascivious announcement that Honeychile's bottom was like a boy's. I know that we are all becoming more broadminded nowadays, but really old chap <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> have been thinking of?" ...|$|E
500|$|... "A Time Machine Is My New Girlfriend" [...] is a frenetic rocker with a Bo Diddley rhythm, {{and lyrics}} cautioning {{listeners}} that relationships can come with [...] "late fees". Hunt explained its lyrics to be {{a metaphor for}} his lover making him feel younger. The title track features metronomic drumming and chicken scratch riffs. It is about people from different economic classes falling in love after social and economic conditions moved them into the same neighborhood. The setting is described in the first verse, [...] "It's the end of white flight / even tycoons are licking their wounds / economic blight got the neighborhood looking gap-toothed / end of white flight / maybe now you see something you like / money tight and you're hating your life". Hunt said that writing the song was [...] "essentially a response {{to some of the}} things I have seen {{as a result of the}} global recession we are going through. I wasn't trying to make any political statement. I was more making a philosophical comment that essentially says we have all these unspoken issues in our society. But I see a collision of those ideas and unresolved issues. My question is <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>you</b> have been hoping for when we make the kind of decisions in our society that we have made." ...|$|E
2500|$|Anderson {{spoke of}} the album's title {{as a kind of}} {{shorthand}} Darwinism reflecting his own journey from the gutter to the stars. Fans noted the similarity to experimental film-maker Stan Brakhage's 1964 film, Dog Star Man. According to Anderson, the film had no influence on the title. He claims that the three words are featured in almost all the songs in some form. The title is intended as a proud summation of Suede's evolution.
