25|$|A central {{question}} {{with regard to}} marriage is whether it stops at death or continues into heaven. The question arises due to a statement of Jesus’ {{that there is no}} marriage in heaven (Luke 20:27–38, Matthew 22:23–32, and Mark 12:18–27). Swedenborg wrote The Lord God Jesus Christ on Marriage In Heaven as a detailed analysis of <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant.</b>|$|E
25|$|A new {{generation}} of scholars and historians interested in determining exactly what happened {{have been able to}} locate documents in private collections and other sources. An indication of renewed interest in Christian Renatus and <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> to his time was shown in September, 2008 when a birthday festival was held in his honor in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, based on eighteenth-century sources and sponsored by the Historic Bethlehem Partnership, the Moravian Music Foundation and the Moravian Archives.|$|E

5000|$|It {{is unclear}} {{what kind of}} {{creature}} the character represents; while Bungle is a bear and George a hippopotamus, Zippy bears no obvious resemblance to any real animal.

500|$|In his autobiography, Crowley {{claimed that}} his {{purpose in life}} had been to [...] "bring oriental wisdom to Europe and to restore paganism in a purer form", {{although}} <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> by [...] "paganism" [...] was unclear.|$|E
500|$|Vasey {{later told}} King that [...] "We were lucky, {{we were very}} lucky." [...] King countered that [...] "if you're {{inferring}} that {{what we did was}} luck, I don't agree with you sir because I think we weren't lucky, we were just bloody good." [...] Vasey replied that <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> was that he, Vasey, was lucky. He confided to Herring that he felt that he had made a potentially disastrous mistake: [...] "it is quite wrong to send out a small unit like the 2/6th Independent Company so far that they cannot be supported." ...|$|E
500|$|The CDC {{agrees to}} allow Olivia {{to enter the}} {{building}} and use the air ventilation system to spread some fentanyl gas, which will gain them time while the cure is synthesized. While inside, Peter attacks her, but Olivia is able to turn the air on, successfully knocking out the building's occupants. Peter and everyone else are successfully cured. Astrid later approaches Walter and asks <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> {{when he said he}} couldn't let Peter die again, to which he responds by saying [...] "some things are meant to be left alone." ...|$|E

500|$|The quiet {{period in}} Massachusetts was over. Adams was easily re-elected to the Massachusetts House in May 1773, {{and was also}} elected as {{moderator}} of the Boston Town Meeting. In June 1773, Adams introduced a set of private letters to the Massachusetts House, written by Hutchinson several years earlier. In one letter, Hutchinson recommended to London {{that there should be}} [...] "an abridgement of what are called English liberties" [...] in Massachusetts. Hutchinson denied that this is <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant,</b> but his career in Massachusetts was effectively over. The House sent a petition to the king asking for his recall.|$|E
500|$|While writing East Coker Eliot {{thought of}} {{creating}} a [...] "quartet" [...] of poems that would reflect {{the idea of the}} four elements and, loosely, the four seasons. As the first four parts of The Waste Land has been associated with one of the four classical elements so has each of the constituent poems of Four Quartets: air (BN,) earth (EC,) water (DS,) and fire (LG.) However, there is little support for the poems matching with individual seasons. Eliot described <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> by [...] "quartet" [...] in a 3 September 1942 letter to John Hayward: ...|$|E
500|$|Elliott {{was also}} the one who hired Hayden Fry as Iowa's {{football}} coach in 1979. [...] Fry later said that Elliott {{was one of the}} principal reasons he chose to coach at Iowa. [...] In his autobiography, Fry wrote: [...] "Iowa had one thing in its favor as far as I was concerned: Bump Elliott was its athletic director. [...] Bump had a reputation as being a fair, honest and well-liked administrator." [...] Elliott told Fry that he would be the last football coach Bump ever hired. [...] Fry was puzzled and asked Elliott <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant.</b> [...] Elliott said, [...] "Simple, I don’t think they’ll {{give me a chance to}} hire another coach, so if you don’t make it, neither will I." [...] He is the only person to have been with Rose Bowl teams in five capacities – player, assistant coach, head coach, assistant athletic director, and athletic director.|$|E

500|$|Macdonald's {{speech was}} seen as a {{personal}} triumph, but it did little to salvage the fortunes of his government. With eroding support both in the Commons and among the public, Macdonald went to the Governor General, Lord Dufferin on 5 November and resigned; Liberal leader Alexander Mackenzie became the second Prime Minister of Canada. Following the resignation, Macdonald returned home and told his wife Agnes, [...] "Well, that's got along with", and when asked <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant,</b> told her of his resignation, and stated, [...] "It's a relief to be out of it." [...] He is not known to have spoken of the events of the Pacific Scandal again. When Macdonald announced his resignation in the Commons, Conservative and Liberal MPs traded places on the benches of the House of Commons, though one Conservative MP, British Columbia's Amor De Cosmos remained in his place, thereby joining the Liberals.|$|E
500|$|The WWF {{received}} some support {{from people who}} felt that the company {{did the right thing}} by continuing the event. Vince Russo, a WWF script writer at the time, pointed to the fact that Brian Pillman, a family friend of the Harts and a member of The Hart Foundation, died shortly before the [...] pay-per-view on which he was scheduled to perform in 1997. After learning of Pillman's death, both Bret and Owen Hart went ahead with their matches on the show. Russo claimed that this showed that [...] "the night he passed away I'm sure Owen would have wanted the same thing." [...] Vince McMahon refused to comment on Hart's death until he felt sufficient time had passed. When asked if he felt responsible for the accident, he replied, [...] "I have a lot to say and I will say it. I promise you that. But {{this is not the time}} to do it.... Give me a few days. Give me to the end of the week. Then we'll talk." [...] The day after Over the Edge, the WWF published a message in the Calgary Sun, stating, [...] "We do not have much information as to how it happened and will not know until an investigation is completed. We are all shaken, and to say Owen will be missed is to fall short of a way to fully explain <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant</b> to us." [...] Although the WWF had no information, they reported that [...] "Our thoughts and prayers go out to the entire Hart family. We have to be strong for Owen; he was an extraordinary human being and consummate performer and knows that the highest tribute that we can pay is to go on entertaining the fans he loved so much." ...|$|E

2500|$|Keats's ideas here, as {{was usually}} {{the case in}} his letters, were {{expressed}} tersely with no effort to fully expound <b>what</b> <b>he</b> <b>meant,</b> but passages from other letters enlarge on the same theme.
