In 2004 a pipe was broken by builders while they were working on the upgrade of the Fofanny water treatment works, near the source of the river.

40|$|Abstract: The {{majority}} of rural areas in South Africa are experiencing {{the challenges of}} accessing <b>water</b> <b>services</b> because they cannot {{afford to pay for}} municipal <b>services.</b> However, the <b>Water</b> <b>Services</b> Authorities (WSA) and <b>Water</b> <b>Services</b> Providers (WSP) are entrusted by the Department of Water Affairs (DWA) with the task of ensuring that everyone in the country, including poor households who cannot pay for <b>water</b> <b>services,</b> have access to at least a basic level of service (defined as 25 l per person per day) at no cost. It is also acknowledged that most municipalities predominately serving rural communities face a number of challenges in supplying these communities with at least basic level of service.

40|$|Financing of {{multiple}} use (i. e. domestic and productive) <b>water</b> <b>services</b> {{was identified as}} an important ingredient to ensure improved water access for rural poor and broaden livelihood options in South Africa. Following the principles of integrated water resource management (IWRM), efficient, equitable and sustainable investments in improved <b>water</b> <b>services</b> {{should be based on}} a thorough understanding of actual demand by consumers. Comprehensive studies looking at multiple use <b>water</b> <b>services</b> are not common in South African rural areas, where most of the economic analyses focus on either domestic or irrigation water demand. This study aims at filling this gap by assessing the household demand for multiple use <b>water</b> <b>services</b> in Sekororo-Letsoalo area in the Limpopo Province. Choice modelling is the approach used to identify the attributes determining demand for <b>water</b> <b>services</b> and quantify their relative importance. Results show that households in rural areas {{are willing to pay for}} improvements in <b>water</b> <b>services.</b> Due to the current poor level of <b>water</b> <b>services</b> in the area, users are primarily concerned with basic domestic uses and, consequently, demand for productive uses is low. Only households already relatively well served are interested in engaging in multiple water uses...|$|R
5|$|With nearly 3,000telephone poles {{damaged or}} snapped and 32,000service outages, Southern Bell and AT quickly {{began work on}} {{restoring}} telephone service, sending workers from their centers in Atlanta and Jacksonville, respectively. The companies shipped about 225tons of copper wire and 20rail cars full of poles and switchboards. The Southern Bell office in Delray Beach was nearly destroyed, causing workers to move the service center to a nearby building.

5|$|Communications on {{the island}} failed due to the winds; the entire island was left without power and phone service. The winds greatly damaged 715power poles and 513transformers, leaving about $52million in {{electrical}} damage reported (2002USD, $ USD). The local weather office's communication link was cut off after flooding damaged a telecommunication facility, causing the National Weather Service in Honolulu, Hawaii, to provide backup support by temporarily issuing warnings and advisories. Many anemometers near the northern coastline failed from the winds. The winds collapsed several walls at the Guam Memorial Hospital, resulting in major damage throughout the northern two-thirds of the facility and several units being shut down. Several hotels, churches, and schools received moderate damage, and the Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport received damage to navigation equipment. Typhoon Pongsona also left 65% of the island's water wells inoperable, with most of Guam left without <b>water</b> <b>service</b> following the storm. Officials estimate the typhoon destroyed 1,300homes, severely damaged 1,825, and lightly damaged 4,800.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Taiwan flooding in Kaohsiung, officials deployed 7,888troops to the southern portion of the island to assist in rescue and recovery work. Soldiers also set up five medical centers, and utilized amphibious vehicles to rescue people in flooded areas. Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou toured the flooded regions on September23, emphasizing that efforts to drain the flooding should be the main priority. More than 100buildings in Kaohsiung required water pumps and thousands of volunteers to remove standing water from basements and streets. The mayor Kiku Chen temporarily suspended her reelection campaign due to the floods. About 80% of the factories in Kaohsiung were reopened by September21. The high crop damage allowed farmers to qualify for low interest loans. Rail lines took two weeks to reopen due to damage. Power and <b>water</b> <b>service</b> was restored {{within days of the}} storm, although residents in flooded areas were advised to boil water before usage. There was also an increase in dengue fever after the floods. The Red Cross Society of China donated about US$100,000 {{in the days after the}} storm. The government announced on September20 that families affected by the floods would receive NT$30,000 (US$945.92) per house. Throughout Taiwan, exports during September 2010 decreased 6.9% from August's levels due to the storm and an industrial fire.|$|E

5|$|Douglas' cottage, {{located in}} Coconut Grove at 37443754 Stewart Avenue, {{was built in}} 1924. She wrote all of her major books and stories in the cottage, and the City of Miami {{designated}} it an historic site in 1995, {{not only for its}} famous owner but also for its unique Masonry Vernacular architecture. After Douglas' death, Friends of the Everglades proposed making the house part of an education center about Douglas and her life, but neighbors protested, citing issues with parking, traffic, and an influx of visitors to the quiet neighborhood. The house, which had an exterior floodwater line from the 1926 Miami Hurricane and some damage from an infestation of bees, had fallen further into disrepair. For a while, the idea of moving the house to Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in Coral Gables, which Douglas helped to develop and where there is a life size bronze statue to commemorate her efforts, was considered. The State of Florida owns Douglas' house and in April 2007 placed it in the care of the Florida Park Service, a division of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Restoration of the floors and counters took place in the following months. <b>Water</b> <b>service</b> was reconnected to the house and the electrical system was updated for safety purposes.

To address this, the CSIR with support from the WRC initiated a desktop study to explore the subject and concept of franchising, its relevance to the <b>water</b> <b>services</b> sector, and its prospects as an institutional option for <b>water</b> <b>services</b> operations and management. The study found that the franchising concept and its success in the commercial sector showed many characteristics which could in favourable circumstances alleviate problems encountered in municipal <b>water</b> <b>services</b> delivery. At the same time, franchising would have the added advantages of stimulating and supporting SMME and BEE activities. The study indicated opportunities in the <b>water</b> <b>services</b> delivery chain, and recommended that these be further explored.

The international financial institutions have blamed lack of access to clean water on government corruption and deficient funding.

Growing international social movements have been disputing the value of the private provision of <b>water</b> <b>services.</b> This thesis adds to the debates by arguing that the private provision of <b>water</b> <b>services</b> is a political choice, not an economic inevitability and that the private provision of <b>water</b> <b>services</b> does not promote the mission of the international financial institutions to decrease poverty by increasing access to clean water. The private provision of <b>water</b> <b>services</b> is not efficient because it is a natural monopoly and it tends to: increase <b>water</b> costs and <b>service</b> disconnections, not account for the costs from water-borne illness, concentrate investment in wealthy areas, and perpetrate corruption.
