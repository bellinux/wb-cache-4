5|$|In {{areas where}} the heavy {{rainfall}} {{is associated with a}} <b>wind</b> <b>shift,</b> the wet season is known as the monsoon. Rainfall in the wet season is mainly due to daytime heating which leads to diurnal thunderstorm activity within a pre-existing moist airmass, so the rain mainly falls in late afternoon and early evening in savannah and monsoon regions. Further, much of the total rainfall each day occurs in the first minutes of the downpour, before the storms mature into their stratiform stage. Most places have only one wet season, but areas of the tropics can have two wet seasons, because the monsoon trough, or Intertropical Convergence Zone, can pass over locations in the tropics twice per year. However, since rain forests have rainfall spread evenly through the year, {{they do not have a}} wet season.|$|E

500|$|An outflow boundary, {{also known}} as a gust front, is a storm-scale or {{mesoscale}} boundary separating thunderstorm-cooled air (outflow) from the surrounding air; similar in effect to a cold front, with passage marked by a <b>wind</b> <b>shift</b> and usually a drop in temperature and a related pressure jump. Outflow boundaries can persist for 24 hours or more after the thunderstorms that generated them dissipate, and can travel hundreds of kilometers from their area of origin. New thunderstorms often develop along outflow boundaries, especially near the point of intersection with another boundary (cold front, dry line, another outflow boundary, etc.). [...] Outflow boundaries can be seen either as fine lines on weather radar imagery or else as arcs of low clouds on weather satellite imagery. From the ground, outflow boundaries can be co-located with the appearance of roll clouds and shelf clouds.|$|E
500|$|Organized {{areas of}} {{thunderstorm}} activity reinforce pre-existing frontal zones, and can outrun cold fronts.

The convection then moves east and toward the equator into the warm sector, parallel to low-level thickness lines.

500|$|Satellite imagery {{showed a}} {{convective}} area with some cyclonic turning {{in connection with}} a tropical wave over Africa on July 22. The convection gradually diminished as the system moved west-southwest into the Atlantic. On July 31, the wave passed south of Trinidad, where a low-level <b>wind</b> <b>shift</b> was detected. For the next couple of days, this system passed over Venezuela and Colombia. Then it crossed into the Pacific basin. It was not until August 6, while it was south of Guatemala, when the convection became organized. Then, the wave strengthened into a tropical depression about 230miles (370km/h) south-southwest of Acapulco, on August 8. The system intensified further and became Tropical Storm Hilda August 9. The storm reached its peak intensity on August 11 with estimated [...] maximum winds and a pressure of [...] The tropical storm moved on a general west-northwest track {{for the next couple of}} days and then turned toward the north on August 13 as it was under the influence of an upper level trough.

500|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{left the}} African coast on June 4 showing some cyclonic curvature {{in the low}} clouds. It passed Barbados six days later, where a low-to-mid <b>wind</b> <b>shift</b> was detected. The wave {{was followed by a}} low level wind surge which was observed in Curaçao on June 12. Most of the shower activity associated with the wave moved westward over South America, and then over Panama on June 14. The convection became organized and developed into Tropical Depression Three-E on June 16 while it was located 348miles (560km) south of Salina Cruz. It became a tropical storm one day later. Carlos reached minimal hurricane strength on June 18. Two days later, Carlos was briefly downgraded to tropical storm status. A strong high pressure system forced Carlos to move over warmer waters and Carlos began to reintensify. Carlos regained hurricane status and developed a well-defined eye and excellent upper level outflow. On June 24, Carlos peaked at [...] central pressure and 115mph (185km/h) maximum sustained winds. The hurricane then weakened when it moved west over colder waters and encountered upper level shear. Carlos dissipated on June 27. The National Hurricane Center received no reports of impact due to this tropical cyclone.|$|E

2500|$|Due to an {{anticyclone}} {{south of}} Japan, favorable westerly winds were dominant {{during most of}} {{the first week of the}} accident, depositing most of the radioactive material out to sea and away from population centers, with some unfavorable wind directions depositing radioactive material over Tokyo.

But after crossing ahead, Alinghi fell behind after tacking for the lay line.

Without the penalty turn the delta would have been around 4 minutes. Winds were 7 to 8 knots. Partial timings for the winner were 0h59 to upwind mark, 0h29 to gybe mark, 0h39 to finish.|$|E
60|$|All was done, accordingly. In half an hour, the Dawn was {{steering}} for {{the western}} coast of England, with everything set we thought it prudent to carry. Two hours after we began {{to move away from}} the spot where they lay, the frigates had sunk behind the curvature of the earth, and we lost sight of them altogether. The weather continued good, the breeze steady and fresh, and the Dawn did her duty admirably. We began to get accustomed to our situations, and found them less arduous than had been apprehended. The direction of the wind was so favourable, that it kept hope alive; though we trebled our distance by going round the British islands, instead of passing directly up channel. Twenty-four hours were necessary to carry us as far north as the Land's End, however; and I determined to be then governed by circumstances. Should the <b>wind</b> <b>shift,</b> we always had the direct route before us; and I had my doubts whether putting a bold face on the matter, running close in with the English shore, and appearing to be bound for London, were not the wisest course. There certainly was the danger of the Speedy's telling our story, in which case there would be a sharp look-out for us; while there was the equal chance that she might speak nothing for a week. Eight-and-forty hours ahead of her, I should not have feared much from her account of us.|$|E
