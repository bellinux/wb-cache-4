40|$|Abstract Background The {{management}} of pandemics with highly infectious diseases in modern urban habitats {{depends largely on}} the maintenance of public services. Understanding {{the factors that influence}} municipal employees’ <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> come <b>to</b> <b>work</b> during a pandemic is therefore a basic requirement for adequate public health preparedness. In this study the extended parallel process model (EPPM) is applied to investigate how the readiness of municipal employees <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>work</b> during an influenza pandemic (IP) is affected by individual attitudes and environmental conditions. Methods 1. 566 employees of a major German city participated in a cross-sectional online survey. The questions of the survey covered the dimensions of risk perception, role competence, self-efficacy, role importance, sense of duty, and <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>work</b> {{in the case of an}} IP. Data were analysed by means of path analyses. Results Data suggest that up to 20  % of the public service workers were not willing <b>to</b> come <b>to</b> <b>work</b> during an IP. <b>Willingness</b> <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>work</b> was increased by the perception of a high working role competence, a high assessment of role importance, high self-efficacy expectations, and a high sense of duty. Negative effects on <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>work</b> were identified as the perception of a high risk to become infected at work and the perceived risk to infect family members. The decomposition of direct and indirect effects provided important insights into the interrelationships between model variables. Conclusions Measures to increase municipal workers’ <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in case of an infectious pandemic should include communication strategies to inform employees clearly about their particular tasks during such critical events and training exercises to increase their confidence in their competences and skills to fulfil these tasks...|$|R
40|$|As the {{effectiveness}} of a health care response during a disaster depends on an available, skilled and motivated front line health workforce, it is essential to understand and address potential barriers to their participation. We conducted a survey of front line health staff employed in a large regional health workforce in Australia to determine their perceived <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>work</b> during three public health emergency scenarios (weather event, influenza pandemic and bioterrorism event). While <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>work</b> differed by scenario, our research indicated that a similar framework for preparing staff and their families could apply to all disaster scenarios. To ensure that frontline health staff will report <b>to</b> <b>work</b> when they are most needed, response plans should ensure personal confidence in their defined role, emphasising the value of their role and addressing their family concerns...|$|R

Despite the coaching change at the club level, Luongo retained Clark as his personal coach for his summer training. He began working with Melanson {{leading up to the}} 2010–11 season and employed several changes in his playing style, which included playing deeper into his crease instead of challenging shooters.|$|E
5|$|Socially, {{economic}} dynamism {{opened up}} one of the avenues of social mobility in the Roman Empire. Social advancement was thus not dependent solely on birth, patronage, good luck, or even extraordinary ability. Although aristocratic values permeated traditional elite society, a strong tendency towards plutocracy is indicated by the wealth requirements for census rank. Prestige could be obtained through investing one's wealth in ways that advertised it appropriately: grand country estates or townhouses, durable luxury items such as jewels and silverware, public entertainments, funerary monuments for family members or coworkers, and religious dedications such as altars. Guilds (collegia) and corporations (corpora) provided support for individuals to succeed through networking, sharing sound business practices, and a <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} project investigates what modifiable factors impede nurses’ <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>work</b> during a disaster. The survey sample were nurses in the United States. Survey methodology was a snowball sampling initiated among nurses attending a PhD Program at the University of Texas at Tyler {{as well as}} the utilization of Facebook to recruit participants. The survey instrument determined likelihood of nurses reporting <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in various types of disasters and factors that may impede them from responding to such disasters. The online survey asked thirty-five “select all that apply” type questions and the results will be used to improve disaster response rates among nurses. Additionally, subscales were created utilizing Likert style questions for the concepts of risk, perceived duty, education, resources, and faith in healthcare facility leadership. Lastly, nurse preparedness was assessed by asking dichotomous questions pertaining to whether or not participants possess recommended items of preparedness. There is a great need to identify these modifiable factors in order to provide evidence-based data that will serve as a baseline for interventions <b>to</b> improve nurse <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in times of dire need. This would not only increase {{the quality and quantity of}} patient care but also strengthen nurses’ perceived safety and confidence in the work place. Understanding these modifiable factors may lead <b>to</b> increased <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in times of need, thus saving more lives with an adequate staffing of willing, competent nurses...|$|R
40|$|Degree Project Thesis, Programme in Medicine. TITLE: Hospital {{preparedness}} {{for chemical}} threats - A pilot study among emergency medicine staff in Gothenburg, Sweden. Abstract 	 Introduction: An impendent exposure to hazardous materials {{has become a}} reality worldwide. Increasing numbers of transportations with loaded chemical agents, the increasing risk of contamination due to an accident {{and the use of}} chemicals in conflicts or terror events, may all result in a disastrous outcome. These events should be managed medically. Hospital preparedness is an important component of a successful management of such events. Aim: To identify hospital staff´s preparedness for chemical threats in Gothenburg, Sweden and to investigate how training affects the knowledge and the <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>work</b> during a chemical event. We also aim <b>to</b> compare the <b>willingness</b> of the Swedish healthcare staff <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> <b>to</b> that of the Israeli staff. Method: A validated questionnaire for assessing knowledge and readiness <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>work</b> in a chemical major incident, already used in Israel, was used to study the level of knowledge and readiness among Swedish emergency staff in Gothenburg. Results: The overall level of knowledge was low. There was a positive statistically significant correlation between higher knowledge and participation in any chemical warfare (CW) training program (P= 0. 000). Participation in any CW training program also showed positive and statically significant correlation <b>to</b> a higher <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>work</b> during a CW (P= 0. 036). Discussion: There is a need for improved knowledge concerning chemical threats and its management among the healthcare staff in Gothenburg. Such improvement may be obtained by initiation of training programs. Additional knowledge may also improve staff´s self-confidence to manage a CW event and report <b>to</b> <b>work</b> during such potential occurence. Conclusions: The emergency staff members should be offered regular educational opportunities, targeted to improve their knowledge and <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> report <b>to</b> <b>work</b> during chemical events. Key words: hospital preparedness, chemical events, report <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> knowledge...|$|R

5|$|The Percheron is a {{breed of}} draft horse that {{originated}} in the Huisne river valley in western France, part of the former Perche province from which the breed takes its name. Usually gray or black in color, Percherons are well muscled, and known for their intelligence and <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> Although their exact origins are unknown, the ancestors of the breed {{were present in the}} valley by the 17th century. They were originally bred for use as war horses. Over time, they began to be used for pulling stagecoaches and later for agriculture and hauling heavy goods. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Arabian blood was added to the breed. Exports of Percherons from France to the United States and other countries rose exponentially in the late 19th century, and the first purely Percheron stud book was created in France in 1883.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} ballot on November 2, 2004, Boustany and Mount {{garnered}} the most votes; Cravins {{was defeated by}} less than two thousand votes. As both fell short of a majority, a second ballot was mandated. In the subsequent campaign, Mount criticized Boustany for favoring {{tax cuts for the}} rich and being indifferent to health care, while Boustany rejected the attacks as false and stressed his <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> with Democrats and Independents. Boustany in turn portrayed Mount as liberal and favoring tax increases. Mount criticized Boustany for favoring the privatization of social security, an unpopular position in Louisiana, and as distant from the interests of individual voters. She received endorsements from U.S. Senator John Breaux, who had represented the 7th district for over fourteen years, and Governor Kathleen Blanco. Boustany was helped by Vice President Dick Cheney, who campaigned on his behalf in Lake Charles. Mount, however, was not endorsed by Democratic primary opponent Don Cravins, who complained about the state Democratic Party's endorsement of Mount in a partially party funded mailer that excluded him and which he believed contributed to his narrow loss. Cravins prepared a suit in federal court claiming that the state Democratic Party violated the Voting Rights Act.|$|E
5|$|According to Bruce, {{men were}} needed to allow Australia's {{extensive}} resources to be developed. In 1923, much of Australia's land was virtually unoccupied, and Bruce believed Australia {{had the potential to}} be one of the most fertile and productive nations in the world, which could sustain populations upward of 100 million over time more than 16 times the population of his time. Despite dissenting voices from scientists, who noted that poor climate, soils and water availability were significant barriers to large populations, the Bruce-Page government enacted policies to encourage large numbers of British to migrate to Australia. Under the auspices of the new Development and Migration Commission, £34 million in loans took place over the decade starting in 1924 to facilitate immigrant settlement through improvements to rural infrastructure, land access, and subsidising immigrant journeys ("passages"). Estimates as high as half a million British immigrants over ten years were predicted at the start of the policy, whereas just over 200,000 travelled to Australia during that time period. Bruce's settlement plan rested on rural growth. Migrants were often selected on the basis of their <b>willingness</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> on the land; state and Commonwealth governments concentrated their investment on rural development and encouraged returned servicemen to take up farms on the periphery of settled areas. Despite this, a majority of these migrants settled in urban areas, as Australia's rural areas were far more remote and difficult to work (than for example England's) and many of those taking advantage of the assistance scheme were urban workers or family and friends of those already settled. Immigration from outside Great Britain and her dominions was considered unpalatable the Bruce government upheld the White Australia policy by placing strong restrictions on immigration from other areas, notwithstanding its population growth targets.|$|E
