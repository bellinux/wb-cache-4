40|$|Background and aims: In recent years, {{increasing}} summer temperatures {{coupled with}} reduced and erratic rainfall {{during the growing}} season have induced accelerated fruit ripening in several regions, resulting in an undesirable increase in <b>wine</b> <b>alcohol</b> content. This study was designed to evaluate the impact of canopy and water management on grape sugar and flavonoid accumulation, with the goal of reducing <b>wine</b> <b>alcohol</b> content while conserving or enhancing flavonoid concentration. Methods and Results: In 2011 and 2012, two irrigation treatments (I–irrigated and DI–deficit irrigated) and two canopy heights (HC–high canopy and SC–short canopy) were applied in a ‘Merlot’ vineyard.

40|$|Background and Aims: Post-veraison {{trimming}} and defoliation {{have been}} proposed as strategies to decrease the concentration of berry carbohydrate at harvest and of <b>wine</b> <b>alcohol,</b> but it is unclear which of these two pruning techniques is more suitable and at what intensity they should be applied. The aimof this 3 -year study was to compare the suitability of two intensities of post-veraison trimming or defoliation in controlling sugar accumulation in the berries of Aglianico grapevines. Methods and Results: Five treatments were compared: two intensities of defoliation, two intensities of shoot trimming and a control. All pruning treatments decreased berry TSS at harvest and <b>wine</b> <b>alcohol</b> concentration. Defoliation and trimming of moderate intensity also improved wine sensory score, whereas intense defoliation and trimming can affect negatively this parameter. Conclusions: Post-veraison defoliation and trimming of moderate intensity appear to be suitable strategies for decreasing berry TSS at harvest and <b>wine</b> <b>alcohol</b> concentration. Significance of the Study: The selection of the correct intensity of leaf removal appears {{to be one of}} the critical factors in correctly designing a suitable strategy of post-veraison summer pruning that aims to decrease sugar accumulation in the berries, whereas the choice of the type of pruning appears to be less crucial...|$|E

40|$|The {{quality of}} grapes, {{as well as}} wine quality, flavor, stability, and sensorial {{characteristics}} depends on the content and composition of several different groups of compounds from grapes.

In addition, consumers know that wines with high alcohol content can causes a gustatory disequilibrium affecting wine sensory perceptions leading to unbalanced wines.

40|$|A uva Isabel da Serra Gaúcha geralmente não alcança teor de açúcar suficiente para produzir vinho equilibrado e, em determinados casos, para atingir 10 % v/v de álcool, concentração mínima para vinho de mesa estabelecida pela legislação brasileira. O objetivo do presente trabalho foi avaliar o efeito de diferentes produtos utilizados para correção do mosto na composição química do vinho Isabel. O experimento constou de seis tratamentos: testemunha (sem correção), sacarose, açúcar mascavo, mosto concentrado, álcool vínico e glicose de milho. Os vinhos foram elaborados em microvinificações, com seis repetições. As amostras foram avaliadas através das análises clássicas, efetuadas por métodos físico-químicos, e dos elementos minerais por absorção atômica. A sacarose foi o produto mais adequado para a correção do mosto, pois não incorporou componentes estranhos, não alterou a relação álcool em peso/extrato seco reduzido e apresentou elevado rendimento alcoólico. O álcool vínico pode ser utilizado desde que seja um produto genuíno de procedência garantida, preferencialmente obtido de vinho branco. The cv.
