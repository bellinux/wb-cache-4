5|$|Although Adams has {{experimented with}} {{painting}} with <b>watercolor</b> <b>and</b> oil paints (his 1989 covers for Appleseed were rendered {{with a combination}} of ink, <b>watercolor</b> <b>and</b> color pencil), his color work is so sporadic that he says he has to relearn what he has forgotten in the interim each time, and is usually dissatisfied with the results. Because a significant portion of his income is derived from selling his original artwork, he is reluctant to learn how to produce his work digitally.|$|E
5|$|Born in Saint Petersburg into {{a family}} with German-Jewish roots whose {{professionals}} included merchants, doctors, composers and academics, Simonovich-Efimova was highly educated, spending almost two decades studying art in both Russia and Paris to perfect her craft. Skilled in etching, <b>watercolor</b> <b>and</b> oil painting, she helped revive silhouette art in 20th-century Russia.|$|E
5|$|To {{achieve a}} {{harmonious}} visual look, producer designer Hans Bacher and art director Ric Sluiter, along with Robert Walker and Head of Backgrounds Robert Stanton collaborated {{to establish a}} proper chronological location for the film in Chinese history. Since there was no general consensus {{on the time of}} Mulan's existence, they based on the visual design on the Ming and Qing dynasties. An important element of Bacher's design was to turn the art style closer to Chinese painting, with <b>watercolor</b> <b>and</b> simpler design, as opposed to the details of The Lion King and The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Bacher further studied more than thirty-five film directors ranging from the silent era German Expressionism, British and American epics of the 1950s and 60s, and the spaghetti westerns for inspiration for composition, lighting, and staging that would establish settings that enhanced the characters, and additional inspiration was found in the earlier Disney animated films such as Bambi, Pinocchio, and Dumbo to establish a sense of staging.|$|E

25|$|Weston's {{sojourn in}} the Middle East proved {{to have a}} lasting impact on his work. The colors and light he {{witnessed}} there deeply affected his palette.

He produced only a handful of charcoal sketches from this period in his life.|$|E
25|$|The end of {{the eighteenth}} century and the fall of the French monarchy closed the doors on Vallayer-Coster’s still-life ‘era’ and opened them to her new style of florals. It has been argued that this was the {{highlight}} of her career and what she is best known for. However, it has also been argued that the flower paintings were futile to her career. Nevertheless, this collection contained floral studies in oil, <b>watercolor</b> <b>and</b> gouache.|$|E

25|$|In {{the final}} {{seven years of}} his life, Whistler did some minimalist seascapes in <b>watercolor</b> <b>and</b> a final self-portrait in oil.

He died in London on July 17, 1903. He is buried in Chiswick Old Cemetery in west London, adjoining St Nicholas Church, Chiswick.|$|E
25|$|Laura Coombs Hills (1859–1952) was an American {{artist and}} {{illustrator}} {{who specialized in}} <b>watercolor</b> <b>and</b> pastel still life paintings, especially of flowers, and miniature portrait paintings on ivory.

25|$|Hopper was a {{good student}} in grade school and showed talent in drawing at age five. He readily absorbed his father's {{intellectual}} tendencies and love of French and Russian cultures. He also demonstrated his mother's artistic heritage. Hopper's parents encouraged his art and kept him amply supplied with materials, instructional magazines, and illustrated books. By his teens, he was working in pen-and-ink, charcoal, <b>watercolor,</b> <b>and</b> oil—drawing from nature as well as making political cartoons. In 1895, he created his first signed oil painting, Rowboat in Rocky Cove. It shows his early interest in nautical subjects.|$|E

25|$|The Alfredo Guati Rojo National Watercolor Museum (Museo Nacional de Acuarela Alfredo Guati Rojo) was {{the first}} museum in the world {{dedicated}} specifically to watercolor painting. It {{is located in the}} Coyoacán borough of Mexico City, in a former private house which was donated to the museum by the city government. It was founded and run by artist Alfredo Guati Rojo from its beginnings in 1964 until his death in 2003. The museum is dedicated to the preservation and continuance of watercolor painting both in Mexico and abroad, with its permanent collection of 300 works donated by Guati Rojo and his wife, classes in <b>watercolor</b> <b>and</b> drawing, its annual Premio Nacional de Acuarela (National Watercolor Prize) and various temporary exhibits both at the museum and abroad.|$|E
25|$|In addition, their {{daughter}} Lady Mary Elizabeth Bennet (21 May 1785 to 27 Feb, 1861) {{worked with her}} Father's gardener (William Richardson) to cultivate new strains of tri-colored viola pansy flowers that were presented to the botanical society and horticulture groups in 1812 with wide acceptance. Lady Mary Elizabeth Bennet was also an accomplished artist in <b>watercolor</b> <b>and</b> was invited to many exhibitions. She was trained by London artist John Varley. Her works are on exhibit and in private collections including a composition of her home at Belsay Castle rendered in 1834 after her marriage on 26 July 1831 to Sir Charles Miles Lambert Monck, Bt. The painting of her home at Belsay Castle in Northumberland by Lady Mary Elizabeth Monck {{was found to be}} included as part of the Monck estate in 1912 and now resides in a private collection in the US. Another of her works is the Burial Place of the Breadalbanes from the Churchyard at Killin done in 1826-1827 on a trip to the Scottish highlands with her brother. This haunting graveyard work may have been inspired by the seat of her Father's estate as the Earl of Tankerville being at Chillingham Castle which is rumored to be quite haunted. From 1815 to 1823 (before her marriage) artist Lady Mary Elizabeth Bennet also trained and worked with the genius London artist John Linnell in engraving as well as miniature painting on ivory. They together produced a set of (12) engravings about Chillingham Castle that were started in 1815 and not finished and published until 1818.|$|E

500|$|A notable {{turning point}} for his career came in 1963 when a {{watercolor}} (similar to Jazz Giants #1 (1962)) was accepted for the Art Institute's [...] "2nd Biennial Drawing, <b>Watercolor</b> <b>and</b> Print Exhibition." [...] The exhibit earned him prizes, media attention, {{and the opportunity to}} exhibit his work at other galleries throughout the Midwest. He moved to a large studio in the Hyde Park neighborhood and continued expanding on his work and focusing on musical and sport related themes. His pigment application became rapid, whether he was depicting a jazz musician or a jockey on his horse, allowing the image to express strong movement. Cockfight (1965) shows the evolution of Jarrell's work: intense color bands, swirls, and at times a psychedelic appearance to the bird in focus, a style that became a mainstay in his work.|$|E
500|$|The art in Ōkami {{is highly}} {{inspired}} by Japanese <b>watercolor</b> <b>and</b> wood carving {{art of the}} Ukiyo-e style, such {{as the work of}} Hokusai. Ōkami was originally planned to be rendered in a more photorealistic 3D style. However, Clover Studio determined that the more colorful sumi-e style allowed them to better convey Amaterasu's association with nature and the task of restoring it. The change was also influenced by limitations in the PS2 hardware to render the photorealistic 3D graphics. As a result of the switch to the watercolor style, the idea of the Celestial Brush came about. Atsushi Inaba, CEO of Clover, noted that [...] "Once we fixed ourselves on a graphical style and got down to the brushwork, we thought 'Wouldn't it be great if we could somehow get the player involved and participate in this artwork instead of just watching it?' That's how the idea of the Celestial Brush was born". Original concepts for enemies included the use of dinosaurs, but the designs settled onto more demon-like characters.|$|E
