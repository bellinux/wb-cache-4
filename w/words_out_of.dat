25|$|In 1979, Sciascia {{was elected}} for the Radical Party in the House of Deputies {{and become a}} member of the {{committee}} of the House for the investigation into Moro's kidnapping, which stated that there was a certain amount of negligence on the part of the Christian Democrat Party in their stance that the state was bigger than a person, and that they would not swap Moro for 13 political prisoners, even though Moro himself had stated that the swapping of innocent people for political prisoners was a valid option in negotiations with terrorists. However, senior members of the party disagreed with this stance and were of the view that Moro had been drugged and tortured to utter these <b>words.</b> <b>Out</b> <b>of</b> this experience, Sciascia wrote an important book.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{variation}} in the pronunciation of the first consonant of certain clusters, most commonly C or P in cç, ct, pç and pt. These consonants may be variably elided or conserved. For some words, this variation may exist inside a country, sometimes in all of them; for others, the variation is dialectal, with the consonant being always pronounced in one country and always elided in the other. This variation affects 0.5% of the language's vocabulary, or 575 <b>words</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 110,000. In most cases, Brazilians variably conserve the consonant while speakers elsewhere have invariably ceased to pronounce it (for example, detector in Brazil versus detetor in Portugal). The inverse situation is rarer, occurring in words such as fa(c)to and conta(c)to (consonants never pronounced in Brazil, pronounced elsewhere). Until 2009, this reality could not be apprehended from the spelling: while Brazilians did not write consonants that were no longer pronounced, the spelling of the other countries retained them in many words as silent letters, usually when there was still a vestige of their presence in the pronunciation of the preceding vowel. This could give the false impression that European Portuguese was phonologically more conservative in this aspect, when in fact it was Brazilian Portuguese that retained more consonants in pronunciation.|$|E
25|$|Only 24 <b>words,</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> 3,412, {{are found}} in all five branches, {{and most of these}} are words for {{recently}} introduced items, such as guns and cattle, or cultural or mythological terms which could easily be borrowed. Thus there is no good evidence for a Tasmanian language family. There is, however, slight evidence that the northern and western families may be distantly related (the western varieties are especially poorly attested). The only words found in all regions that are not obvious candidates for borrowing and which do not have serious problems with attestation are *pene- 'laugh', *taway 'go', *liya 'water', *wii 'wood', and perhaps *tina 'belly'. However, there are other local words for 'laugh', 'water', and 'belly', and the reflexes of *taway are so similar as to be suspicious. *Wii is therefore the most promising; it is found as wiya, wina, wikina (-na is a common ending) and wii, glossed as wood, tree, brush, or timber. Although {{there is no evidence that}} the Tasmanian languages were related to the languages of mainland Australia (and if they were, they would presumably be related to languages which had been lost to the wave of Pama–Nyungan expansion), the fact that there is no established Tasmanian family should be kept in mind when attempting to establish such connections.|$|E

500|$|Epstein was so {{concerned}} by the reaction that he considered cancelling the group's upcoming US tour, believing they would be seriously harmed in some way. He then flew to the US and {{held a press conference}} in New York City, where he publicly criticised Datebook, saying the magazine had taken Lennon's <b>words</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> context, and expressed regret on behalf of the group that [...] "people with certain religious beliefs should have been offended in any way". Epstein's efforts had little effect, as the controversy quickly spread beyond the borders of the US. In Mexico City there were demonstrations against the group, and a number of countries, including South Africa and Spain, made the decision to ban the Beatles' music on national radio stations. The Vatican issued a public denouncement of Lennon's comments.|$|E
500|$|As the U.S. vice president, Coolidge and his vivacious wife Grace {{were invited}} to quite a few parties, where the legend of [...] "Silent Cal" [...] was born. It is from this time {{that most of the}} jokes and anecdotes {{involving}} Coolidge originate. Although Coolidge was known to be a skilled and effective public speaker, in private {{he was a man of}} few words and was commonly referred to as [...] "Silent Cal". A possibly apocryphal story has it that a matron, seated next to him at a dinner, said to him, [...] "I made a bet today that I could get more than two <b>words</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> you." [...] He replied, [...] "You lose." [...] Dorothy Parker, upon learning that Coolidge had died, reportedly remarked, [...] "How can they tell?" [...] Coolidge often seemed uncomfortable among fashionable Washington society; when asked why he continued to attend so many of their dinner parties, he replied, [...] "Got to eat somewhere." [...] Alice Roosevelt Longworth, a leading Republican wit, underscored Coolidge's silence and his dour personality: [...] "When he wished he were elsewhere, he pursed his lips, folded his arms, and said nothing. He looked then precisely as though he had been weaned on a pickle." ...|$|E

500|$|Almost {{as soon as}} they {{returned}} home, the Beatles faced a fierce backlash from US religious and social conservatives (as well as the Ku Klux Klan) over a comment Lennon had made in a March interview with British reporter Maureen Cleave. [...] "Christianity will go," [...] Lennon had said. [...] "It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right. ... Jesus was alright but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me." [...] The comment went virtually unnoticed in England, but when US teenage fan magazine Datebook printed it five months later – {{on the eve of the}} group's August US tour – it sparked a controversy with Christians in the American [...] "Bible Belt". The Vatican issued a protest, and bans on Beatles' records were imposed by Spanish and Dutch stations and South Africa's national broadcasting service. Epstein accused Datebook of having taken Lennon's <b>words</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> context; at a press conference Lennon pointed out, [...] "If I'd said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it." [...] Lennon claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success, but at the prompting of reporters, he concluded: [...] "If you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then okay, I'm sorry." ...|$|E

Green wrote that when David French called the work [...] "official but not history", he had used Hart's <b>words</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> context, Liddell Hart meaning that by leaving potentially controversial details to be read between the lines, Edmonds created the risk that later historians might use the phrase [...] "official but not history", to describe the volumes.|$|E

Kenefick accused Moore of presenting his <b>words</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> context in order to defame him, and both Kenefick and his onetime co-blogger, Lee, criticized Moore for claiming to make this donation anonymously, only to highlight it in his film.

2500|$|Emanuel's {{previous}} {{statements on}} rationing {{were about the}} [...] "allocation of very scarce medical interventions such as organs and vaccines" [...] such as who should get a [...] "liver for transplantation". Ezekiel said that McCaughey's euthanasia claims were a [...] "willful distortion of my record". Jim Rutennberg said that Emanuel's critics oversimplified complex issues, such as who should get a kidney. Such rationing {{was said to be}} unavoidable because of scarcity, and because a scarce resource such as a liver is [...] "indivisible". Emanuel said that McCaughey took <b>words</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> context, omitting qualifiers such as [...] "Without overstating it (and without fully defending it) ...
