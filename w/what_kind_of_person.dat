5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it just so happens this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> you are.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{received}} no {{support from the}} Lakers front office, aside from a single call {{the day after the}} fight from Cooke, and was sent torrents of hate mail filled with racial epithets. He was advised by police not to order room service when he played again, as it was feared he would be poisoned. Larry Fleisher, head of the Players' Association, wanted Washington to appeal his suspension, an idea which he originally considered, but ultimately rejected. Although many players around the league sympathized with Washington and said that he had a good reputation off the court, he and his wife became ostracized. They had a two-year-old daughter, and Washington's wife was eight months pregnant with the couple's first son {{at the time of the}} punch. His wife recalls her and the children being treated like pariahs after the incident. Her obstetrician refused her service because she was Washington's wife, and her friends asked her <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> Washington was that he could commit such an act. The only person who contacted them was Newell. Later in the year Washington went to his home with a big screen television which he insisted Newell accept.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Robert Enright {{from the}} University of Wisconsin–Madison founded the International Forgiveness Institute and is {{considered}} the initiator of forgiveness studies. He developed a 20-Step Process Model of Forgiveness. Recent work has focused on <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> {{is more likely to}} be forgiving. A longitudinal study showed that people who were generally more neurotic, angry, and hostile in life were less likely to forgive another person even after a long time had passed. Specifically, these people were more likely to still avoid their transgressor and want to enact revenge upon them two and a half years after the transgression.|$|E

25|$|The 21 past Dark Ones, led by Nimue, {{bring the}} {{residents}} {{to the lake}} that will {{take them to the}} Underworld, and act as a barrier to keep them from escaping. Hook appears to help Nimue carry out the plan as Emma is left to watch. Regina then reminds Hook that he is unable to destroy Emma's family because he has changed as a person, and urges him to choose <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>person</b> he wants to be. Emma attempts to stop the Dark Ones from sacrificing her family, but Nimue starts choking Emma, despite being unable to kill her, to keep her from interfering. As Hook watches, he realizes the truth behind what Regina said, and uses Excalibur to absorb all of the darkness from Nimue and the Dark Ones into himself, which also traps all of the past Dark Ones inside Excalibur. Hook then asks Emma to kill him to destroy the Darkness, in order to allow him to die as a hero. A sad, crying Emma goes through with his wishes and kills Hook with Excalibur, which kills all of the previous Dark Ones. As Hook dies, his neck wound from Excalibur returns, and Emma is transformed back into her normal self, with Excalibur disintegrating afterwards.|$|E

40|$|The {{two most}} often noted {{approaches}} to qualitative meta-analysis are the “metaphoric translation ” approach {{within the field}} of ethnography (Noblit & Hare, 1988) and a thematic synthesis approach most often associated with grounded theory (Patterson, Thorne, Canam, & Jillings, 2001). These approaches have merit. They fall within traditional qualitative inquiry, highlight the importance of context, and both tend to focus on research questions that seek meaning of “lived experiences ” of groups and individuals. For example, the research questions have often been in regard to the exploration of meaning of illness or health. Within the “empirically evidenced based ” community, however, research questions become more focused on synthesizing the cumulative evidence that a particular intervention produces positive outcomes. In other words, what intervention works for <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> outcomes for <b>what</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>persons</b> under <b>what</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> conditions? This focus necessitates an ecological framework, i. e., “What are the mutually interdependent relationships among behavior, persons and environments. Given an ecological framework for qualitative meta-synthesis, then the concepts of “meta-synthesis ” and “triangulation ” become foundational. The work of (Zhao, 1991) and the application of his work by (Patterson, Thorne, Canam, & Jillings, 2001) suggest that a meta-synthesis should include an analysis of theory (meta-theory), an analysis of method (meta-method) and an analysis of findings (meta-analysis).
