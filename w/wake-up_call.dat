25|$|Being {{a daytime}} shelter model, it is a {{critical}} part of caring for the poor and homeless, since most nighttime shelters for sleeping typically put their guests out during the day, early in the morning after <b>wake-up</b> <b>call.</b> Rather than being left to the streets, which can be harsh, the day center provides a place to go and be cared for and also be part of a community, typically much more wide-ranging in services and scope than the nighttime emergency shelter scheme.|$|E

25|$|The investors of the Virginia Company of London {{expected}} to reap rewards from their speculative investments. With the Second Supply, they expressed their frustrations and made demands upon {{the leaders of}} Jamestown in written form. They specifically demanded that the colonists send commodities sufficient to pay {{the cost of the}} voyage, a lump of gold, assurance that they had found the South Sea, and one member of the lost Roanoke Colony. It fell to the third president of the Council Captain John Smith to deliver a bold and much-needed <b>wake-up</b> <b>call</b> in response to the investors in London, demanding practical laborers and craftsmen who could help make the colony more self-sufficient.|$|E
25|$|Russia's February Revolution caught Pântea entrenched {{with his}} men {{somewhere near the}} town of Roman. The news, he later wrote, was a <b>wake-up</b> <b>call</b> for the Bessarabian Romanians in foreign lands, since it offered the {{prospect}} of self-determination at home. As the Provisional Government took hold of military matters, Pântea became President of the Ninth Army's Soviet, and also helped organize the Bessarabian soldiers into a single political body. Similar actions were being taken by other nationally minded Bessarabian officers. Some—Catelli, Anton Crihan, Constantin Osoianu, Ion Păscăluță, Andrei Scobioală—were active on Bessarabia's borders, while others addressed Bessarabian units in places such as Novorossiya (Elefterie Sinicliu) or Crimea (Grigore Turcuman).|$|E
25|$|In the 1960s, the Canadian {{government}} {{funded the}} establishment of secular, government-operated {{high schools in the}} Northwest Territories (including what is now Nunavut) and Inuit areas in Quebec and Labrador along with the residential school system. The Inuit population was not large enough to support a full high school in every community, so this meant only a few schools were built, and students from across the territories were boarded there. These schools, in Aklavik, Iqaluit, Yellowknife, Inuvik and Kuujjuaq, brought together young Inuit from across the Arctic in one place for the first time, and exposed them to the rhetoric of civil and human rights that prevailed in Canada in the 1960s. This was a real <b>wake-up</b> <b>call</b> for the Inuit, and it stimulated {{the emergence of a new}} generation of young Inuit activists in the late 1960s who came forward and pushed for respect for the Inuit and their territories.|$|E

25|$|China's {{defeat in}} the Second Opium War of 1856–60 was a <b>wake-up</b> <b>call.</b> Military {{strategies}} were outdated, both on land and sea {{and in terms of}} weaponry. Sensing an immediate threat from foreigners and realising that China's agricultural-based economy could not hope to compete with the industrial prowess of the West, Cixi decided {{that for the first time}} in Chinese history, China would learn from the Western powers and import their knowledge and technology. At the time, three prominent Han Chinese officials, Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang and Zuo Zongtang, had all begun industrial programs in the country's southern regions. In supporting these programmes, Cixi also decreed the opening of the Tongwen Guan in 1862, a school for foreign languages in Beijing. The Tongwen Guan specialised in new-age topics such as astronomy and mathematics, as well as the English, French and Russian languages. Groups of young boys were also sent abroad to the United States for studies.|$|E

40|$|Many <b>wake-up</b> <b>calls</b> {{have been}} {{received}} for emergency response, due to natural disasters such as hurricanes, fires or man-made incidents.

Simulation systems provide a wider range of training at a much lower expense for emergency preparedness and response. It is identified as the only feasible approach when it is difficult to emulate real-life experiments.

Eddie & JoBo rode a wave of success, but on May 10, 1994, they were fired {{in the aftermath of}} a multimillion-dollar defamation lawsuit filed against them by former WMAQ-TV News anchor Joan Esposito.
