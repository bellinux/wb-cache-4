5|$|The discography of Snow Patrol, an {{alternative}} rock band from Northern Ireland and based in Dundee, Scotland, consists of six studio albums, twenty-eight singles, eight extended plays, two compilation albums and one live DVD. Snow Patrol {{was formed in}} 1994 by Gary Lightbody, Michael Morrison and Mark McClelland under the name Shrug. They released an extended play (EP) titled The Yogurt vs. Yogurt Debate. Morrison left in 1995, and the band changed their name to Polarbear. Under this name they released their other EP, Starfighter Pilot, on the Electric Honey label. Drummer Jonny Quinn joined in 1997 and the band signed to Jeepster Records the same year. They then underwent their final name change to Snow Patrol. The band's first two studio albums: Songs for Polarbears and When It's All Over <b>We</b> <b>Still</b> <b>Have</b> <b>to</b> Clear Up were released in 1998 and 2001 respectively, but failed to do well commercially. Subsequently, the band was dropped by the label.|$|E

After briefly {{using the name}} Polarbear and {{released}} the EP Starfighter Pilot (1997) and losing Morrison as a member, the band became Snow Patrol in 1997 and added Quinn to its line-up. Their first two studio albums, Songs for Polarbears (1998) and When It's All Over <b>We</b> <b>Still</b> <b>Have</b> <b>to</b> Clear Up (2001), were commercially unsuccessful and were released by the independent record label Jeepster Records. The band then signed to the major record label Polydor Records in 2002.|$|E

2500|$|Snow Patrol's {{debut album}} was Songs for Polarbears, {{released}} in 1998 after the band had started living in Glasgow. Lightbody was then {{working at the}} Nice n Sleazy's Bar in Sauchiehall Street. The album was a critical success, but did not make any impact commercially. The same year, the band came close to getting featured in a worldwide advertisement for Philips. Gomez was ultimately signed. In 1999, the band won the [...] "Phil Lynott Award for Best New Band" [...] by Irish music magazine Hot Press. In 2001, still living in Glasgow, the band followed up with When It's All Over <b>We</b> <b>Still</b> <b>Have</b> <b>to</b> Clear Up. Like its predecessor, the album was praised by critics, but did not sell.|$|E
2500|$|The band toured Australia in February 2013 without Barker, who did {{not attend}} due to his fear of flying (Brooks Wackerman of Bad Religion filled in for him). The band toured the United States in September 2013, where they planned to begin writing songs for their seventh studio album. [...] "We're hoping to head into the studio next year [...] album out in late spring/early summer," [...] Hoppus told Kerrang!. In the interim, Hoppus began {{recording}} songs with frequent engineer and producer Chris Holmes that the duo plan to release {{by the end of}} the year. [...] "We probably have seven or eight songs in various stages of completion," [...] Hoppus remarked in August 2013. [...] "I still haven't chosen a name [...] yet; <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> figure that out. It's like guitar mixed with electronics…. at this point." [...] Hoppus will share lead vocals with Holmes on the tracks. On April 25, 2014, Hoppus announced, via Twitter, the name of the band as Nothing and Nobody. Their first album is expected to be released in the [...] "not-too-distant future".|$|E

It's tragic that fear, anger and wrath took over and pierced the hearts of their people. It will be hard to recover from this wound; but we better start working to heal as quickly as possible – and bring down the walls that blinded us in the beginning." ...|$|E

40|$|Cranial base reconstructions {{associated}} with tumor resections around the orbital wall often require {{that both the}} upper and lateral orbital walls be reconstructed during a single procedure. Previously, we used titanium mesh plates that were preoperatively fabricated based on three-dimensional models. Although these plates are precise and do not increase the probability of infection, <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> use autologous bones to reconstruct the orbital walls. Recently, we developed a new titanium mesh plate—called Skull-Fit®—with orbital wall (Skull-Fit WOW®), enabling us to reconstruct the cranial base and orbital walls without bone grafts. Here, we report on three reconstruction {{cases in which the}} novel titanium mesh-orbital wall system was used. In all three cases, the customized titanium mesh system performed satisfactorily with little, if any, complications...|$|R
2500|$|Rothenberg {{said he had}} {{not always}} planned on killing Lexa, but the fact that Debnam-Carey was {{simultaneously}} on another show (Fear the Walking Dead), and was therefore unlikely to ever become a series regular on The 100, he felt use of the character would be limited or absent in the future. This is when the writers decided to craft a death scene for her to propel the story forward. [...] "I remember as we were breaking the season, we talked about reincarnation in the Grounder world and how that was how commanders were selected. I didn't want to throw that out as nonsense, which is how Clarke had received it, but I also didn't want {{to say that it was}} real reincarnation," [...] he said, adding he had been reading The Singularity Is Near by Ray Kurzweil at the time, which [...] "talks quite a bit about a future where we'll be able to upload our minds—literally upload our consciousness—into a computer and live forever." [...] This gave Rothenberg the idea for incorporating a [...] "technological reincarnation" [...] storyline. [...] "The commander A.I. would need to be able to pass itself from person to person over time and [...] Lexa was just the most recent recipient of this artificial intelligence augmentation of her consciousness. So once we came up with that idea, that was the point at which everything jelled and sort of came together storytelling-wise," [...] he stated. [...] "And of course, if you're dealing with a story about reincarnation, you've got to die before you can be reincarnated. So Lexa dying became a very tragic necessity." [...] Rothenberg said Clarke was in love with Lexa, that they were soulmates, and Lexa's death will haunt Clarke. [...] " [...] is going to have to figure out how to compartmentalize, the way that all of us have to do in the real world when people are suddenly and tragically taken away from us," [...] he added. [...] "That's kind of the point of The 100 in many ways. These horrible things happen and yet <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> figure out a way to move on and be the heroes of our own stories." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not so appalling," [...] he answered, [...] "as {{the thought}} of how long <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> live! One regrets one's youth {{as a matter of}} course, but the {{prospect}} of old age is more terrible still! Lucky those men and those women who live and then die. It is that interregnum--the level, monotonous plain of advancing old age, when one takes the waters at Carlsbad and looks askance at the entrées--that is what one has to dread. To watch our own degeneration, the dropping away of our energies, the decline of our taste--why, the tortures of the Inquisition were trifles to it!" ...|$|E

If he met it in some nefarious enterprise her lips might be sealed. Still, in her heart, she must retain bitterness and hatred against those who had killed him and would presumably help so {{far as she could}} to have revenge upon them. Could we see her, then and try to use her? That was my first thought. But now we come to a sinister fact. Miss Burnet has not been seen by any human eye since the night of the murder. From that evening she has utterly vanished. Is she alive? Has she perhaps met her end on the same night as the friend whom she had summoned? Or is she merely a prisoner? There is the point which <b>we</b> <b>still</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> decide.|$|E
