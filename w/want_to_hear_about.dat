5|$|It {{has been}} a {{struggle}} telling this story over the years, {{because a lot of}} people don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> this kind of history. People don't relate to it, or just don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> it. But Mama told me to keep it alive, so I keep telling it... It's a sad story, but it's one I think everyone needs to hear.|$|E
500|$|Asked {{to assess}} his {{personal}} performance {{after the loss}} to Kansas State, Colt McCoy said, [...] "I think I've had some bad luck, I'm definitely a better quarterback, definitely more experienced—I've just had some bad luck. Things that can go the wrong way, have gone the wrong way — tipped balls and that stuff." [...] He also said there was room for improvement, [...] "Teams are blitzing us a lot more. We've handled it well for the most part, but there's so many {{things we can do}} better... If you ask every person on this offense, they'll tell you there's something individually they can do better." [...] After the loss to Oklahoma, Mack Brown said he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> bad luck, [...] "By saying we're unlucky is just a cop-out, this game isn't about luck. [...] If you knock balls loose you should get on them. If you tip balls in the air you should catch them. We're {{not going to have any}} excuses." [...] Brown cited the lack of big plays on defense, particularly the lack of forced turnovers, as a problem for Texas. [...] Both Brown and Greg Davis hinted that Jamaal Charles could face less playing time as a result of his problems hanging onto the ball.|$|E
500|$|McKidd has {{referred}} to his character and the character of Cristina Yang as [...] "soulmates." [...] Speaking of Owen's PTSD storyline, McKidd stated: [...] "What's exciting about telling this story with this character is that it's quite brave of ABC and Shonda , on a prime-time network TV show, to address a tough subject, and one that people don't necessarily <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about.</b> [...] But so far the writing room is handling it beautifully. They're not banging people {{over the head with}} it but exploring it in a sensitive and interesting way." [...] Owen and Cristina have struggled with their fictional relationship in season eight, leading to Owen having a sexual affair. Directly before the episode involving the affair aired, McKidd said to Entertainment Weekly: [...] "The thing about Owen is that he tries to do things perfectly, and obviously, he messes up as the chief because you have to make these odd black-and-white decisions and sometimes you make the wrong decision. There’s a lot of stress in his life at the moment, so he’s trying not to let that affect his efficiency as chief." [...] Although the characters' marriage is tested, McKidd reported to The Hollywood Reporter: [...] "I think they're meant for each other. I hold out faith in Cristina and Owen, even though they go to the darkest places out of all the couples on the show. It's going to get worse but it's going to get better soon." ...|$|E

2500|$|From 1989 {{until her}} {{retirement}} in 2006, Morrison held the Robert F. Goheen Chair in the Humanities at Princeton University. She {{has said she}} doesn't think much of modern fiction writers who reference their own lives instead of inventing new material, and she used to tell her creative writing students, [...] "I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> your little life, OK?" [...] Similarly, she has chosen not to write about her own life in a memoir or autobiography.|$|E
2500|$|Aronowitz {{reported}} Jane saying, [...] "My father can't {{articulate the}} way he works. He just can't do it. He's not even conscious of what he does, and it made him nervous for {{me to try to}} articulate what I was trying to do. And I sensed that immediately, so we did very little talking about it...he said, 'Shut up, I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> it.' He didn't want me to tell him about it, you know. He wanted to make fun of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album's working {{title was}} Strawberries for Pigs, a name {{inspired}} by the reception the band's newer music received from some of their older fans. As Vanian explained, [...] "we were playing {{a lot of new}} material, and we had an audience that didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> anything, they just wanted to hear Neat Neat Neat and New Rose nothing else. And they wanted to just smash everything. And they weren't interested in hearing music at all. So at one point, I turned around and said, 'It's like giving strawberries to a fucking pig, this gig, you know?' And that stuck in our minds, and we used it".|$|E
6000|$|... "Fine! I {{know exactly}} what your aunt <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about,</b> Rocky. She <b>wants</b> an earful of cabaret stuff. The place {{you ought to go}} to first, Jeeves, is Reigelheimer's. It's on Forty-second Street. Anybody will show you the way." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bruno Acari IV, {{who played}} with Meazza at A.C. Milan and later coached, once said that [...] "Peppino never <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> tactics. He was a simple person who became a king {{when he entered the}} goal box, with a {{technical}} ability that was comparable to Pelé." ...|$|R

2500|$|Cook {{never worked}} for a Major League {{baseball}} team; he described the relationship between himself and baseball franchises in the forward to Percentage Baseball: [...] "I {{would be willing to}} go as far as pretending to understand why none of four competent and successful executives of second-division ball clubs were most reluctant to employ probabilistic methods of any description... but they did not even <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> them!" [...] Though Cook himself was never hired by a Major League team, his work influenced Major League Baseball personnel such as Tal Smith, Ewing Kauffman and Davey Johnson, as well as future sabermetricians like Palmer. [...] Percentage Baseball also influenced Eric Walker, who worked for the San Francisco Giants and Sandy Alderson's Oakland Athletics. [...] Cook's slide rule, which he used during his research for Percentage Baseball, was donated upon request to the Baseball Hall of Fame. Earnshaw Cook {{died of a heart attack}} in 1987.|$|E
2500|$|Reviews of Brothers in Arms {{from the}} UK music press were {{generally}} negative. In a scathing review for NME, Mat Snow said, [...] "Dire Straits are so tasteful {{as to be}} entirely flavourless, so laid back as to bore me horizontal". He continued, [...] "So do you seriously <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> the further adventures of Mark Knopfler's mawkish self-pity, his lugubriously mannered appropriation of rockin' Americana, his thumpingly crass attempts at wit? Can anybody really be moved, stimulated or entertained by the tritest would-be melodies in history, {{the last word in}} tranquilising chord changes, the most cloying lonesome playing and ultimate in transparently fake troubador sentiment ever to ooze out of a million-dollar recording studio?" [...] Eleanor Levy of Record Mirror was similarly dismissive, succinctly stating, [...] "West Coast guitars reeking of mega bucks and sell out stadium concerts throughout the globe. Laid back melodies. Dire Straits – summed up... This is like any other Dire Straits album quarried out of the tottering edifice of MOR rock." [...] The reviews from the UK's other two music papers were less harsh, with Jack Barron of Sounds feeling that [...] "it's only a halfway decent album because it has only halfway decent songs... Knopfler has distilled his sonic essence, via blues, to appeal to billboard romantics with cinemascope insecurities. And he can pull it off well... but not often enough here." [...] Melody Makers Barry McIlheney observed that Knopfler had recently explored different creative directions with his work on movie soundtracks and on Bob Dylan's Infidels, and bemoaned that [...] "unfortunately for the rest of us, this admirable spirit of adventure fails to materialise when it comes to Brothers in Arms. Instead it sounds just a bit too like the last Dire Straits album, which sounded not unlike the last one before that, which sounded suspiciously like the beginning of a hugely successful and very lucrative plan to take over the world known as AOR... the old rockschool restraints and the undeniably attractive smell of the winning formula seem to block out any such experimental work and what you end up with is something very like the same old story." ...|$|E

It {{was only a few}} minutes after Buster's {{disappearance}} that Farmer Brown's footsteps were heard coming down the Lone Little Path, and of course that ended school for that morning.

2500|$|Diederik Stapel (social psychology) – Fabricated data in high-publicity {{studies of}} human behaviour.
