5|$|Towards {{the end of}} his career, Kelly had {{problems}} finding <b>work,</b> <b>but</b> played with Ray Nance, and as a soloist in New York. Kelly's final recording session appears to have been in the autumn of 1970, accompanying saxophonist Dexter Gordon.|$|E
5|$|Cooper is woken early by {{the sound}} of a raucous party in the Great Northern Hotel. He leaves to meet Truman, while Jerry Horne (David Patrick Kelly) meets his brother Benjamin (Richard Beymer) to discuss the new Icelandic investors in their {{property}} developments. Leland Palmer (Ray Wise) arrives, disoriented and wishing to return to <b>work,</b> <b>but</b> the Hornes send him home.

50|$|Hot short iron can be <b>worked,</b> <b>but</b> {{it has to}} {{be worked}} at low {{temperatures}}. Working at lower temperatures requires more physical effort from the smith or forgeman. The metal must be struck more often and harder to achieve the same result. A mildly sulfur contaminated bar can be <b>worked,</b> <b>but</b> it requires a great deal more time and effort.|$|R
5|$|Despite the title, St. John the Baptist Preaching did {{not have}} an {{obviously}} religious theme. The model, an Italian peasant who presented himself at Rodin's studio, possessed an idiosyncratic sense of movement that Rodin felt compelled to capture. Rodin thought of John the Baptist, and carried that association into the title of the work. In 1880, Rodin submitted the sculpture to the Paris Salon. Critics were still mostly dismissive of his <b>work,</b> <b>but</b> the piece finished third in the Salon's sculpture category.|$|E
5|$|During his 1893 tour, Riley lectured {{mostly in}} the western United States, and in his 1894 tour in the east. His {{performances}} were major events, and generally sold out within days of their announcements. In 1894 he allowed author Douglass Sherley to join his tour. Sherley was a millionaire who published his own books. The literary community had dismissed his <b>work,</b> <b>but</b> Riley was instrumental in helping him to be accepted.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, Cantor {{was one of}} the {{distinguished}} foreign scholars invited to attend the 500th anniversary of the founding of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland. Cantor attended, hoping to meet Bertrand Russell, whose newly published Principia Mathematica repeatedly cited Cantor's <b>work,</b> <b>but</b> this did not come about. The following year, St. Andrews awarded Cantor an honorary doctorate, but illness precluded his receiving the degree in person.|$|E

5|$|In early 1915, {{nearly five}} years after {{construction}} had begun, the shipbuilding contractors demanded payment from the Argentine government for additional <b>work,</b> <b>but</b> the Argentines did not believe this was warranted, as Moreno {{had been scheduled to}} be completed more than a year prior.

In his role as USAF Deputy Chief of Staff for Development, Saville helped direct missile <b>work,</b> <b>but</b> soon replaced himself on the GMIORG with Major General Robert M. Lee, commander of TAC. Saville was more interested in air-to-air guided missiles than in ground-based ballistic missiles, which became the focus of the committee.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) distracts {{himself from}} his romantic {{problems}} by attempting to resolve a dispute between two janitors (Bawa and Ramsaywack). Meanwhile, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is offended when she learns that her employees hang out outside of <b>work</b> <b>but</b> do not invite her. This episode of 30 Rock closely mirrored the feud between television hosts Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien.|$|E
5|$|It was Newton's {{conception}} of the universe based upon natural and rationally understandable laws that {{became one of the}} seeds for Enlightenment ideology. Locke and Voltaire applied concepts of natural law to political systems advocating intrinsic rights; the physiocrats and Adam Smith applied natural conceptions of psychology and self-interest to economic systems; and sociologists criticised the current social order for trying to fit history into natural models of progress. Monboddo and Samuel Clarke resisted elements of Newton's <b>work,</b> <b>but</b> eventually rationalised it to conform with their strong religious views of nature.|$|E

5|$|Legumes such as clover or alfalfa {{are usually}} higher in protein, calcium, and energy than grasses. However, they require warm weather and good soil {{to produce the}} best nutrients. Legume hays are {{generally}} higher in protein than the grass hays. They are also higher in minerals, particularly calcium, but have an incorrect ratio of calcium to phosphorus. Because they are high in protein, they are very desirable for growing horses or those subjected to very hard <b>work,</b> <b>but</b> the calcium:phosphorus ratio must be balanced by other feeds to prevent bone abnormalities.|$|E
5|$|Lichtenstein and Loran sparred in the press, and art {{critics were}} {{intrigued}} by the viewpoints of the two. Loran's view was that Lichtenstein had plagiarized his work, {{and at one point}} filed suit. Lichtenstein felt that he was making a statement with his painting on the ridiculous attempt by Loran to explain CÃ©zanne by diagram. The press frequently used the word transformation when crediting Lichtenstein's <b>work,</b> <b>but</b> Lichtenstein attempted not to accept the association of his work with that word.|$|E
