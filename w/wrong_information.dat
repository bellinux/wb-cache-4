A few artillery pieces and Gregg's brigade from Crook's corps moved forward in support. As noted in the previous section, Sheridan had received <b>wrong</b> <b>information</b> so he thought the V Corps was in the rear and almost on the flank of the Confederates and therefore he mistakenly thought V Corps could launch an early, severe attack on Pickett's force.

40|$|The {{address signal}} lines are {{connected}} to a semiconductor memory device when they are implemented on the PCB (Printed Circuit Board). So they experience the wiring capacitance and due to this wiring capacitance on printed circuit board the rising and falling time of respective address signal disperse. If the address signal lines change in timing, the following problem occurs. When a microprocessor connected to a semiconductor memory device changes the address information from one address to another address, due to deviation of timing of the change of the signal, the wrong address is generated. In an Asynchronous semiconductor memory device, the change of address is immediately responded. So it also responds to such <b>wrong</b> address <b>information</b> and internal circuit selects the <b>wrong</b> address <b>information</b> and operates corresponds to that wrong address...|$|R

[...] Pouw commented to ABC News, [...] "People have conflicts on Wikipedia all the time, and it's obvious why [...] anybody can post." [...] Bloomberg Businessweek reported on Pouw's statements, [...] " [...] says her organization regularly monitors the Internet for <b>wrong</b> <b>information</b> about its belief system and members. After this ruling, Pouw says there remain 'gross inaccuracies' on the Scientology article on Wikipedia that she hopes will eventually be corrected. But for the time being, her group's ability to do that have been weakened." [...] In a statement to CNN, Pouw asserted [...] "she is unaware of any coordinated effort to alter Wikipedia".|$|E

Mitsubishi manufactures micro cars for Nissan, which no longer makes that class of vehicle itself. [...] Mitsubishi admitted {{that they had been}} giving <b>wrong</b> <b>information</b> on fuel consumption from 2002 onwards, using inaccurate test methods. Later, the company said it used fuel economy testing methods that did not comply with Japanese regulations for 25 years, much longer than previously known. Mitsubishi management said they did not know about the issue and that the <b>wrong</b> <b>information</b> came from the micro car development department. They ordered an investigation led by investigators not affiliated with the company. The resultant scandal culminated in Nissan acquiring a controlling interest in MMC in May 2016. [...] Nissan agreed to invest 237.4 billion yen ($2.2 billion US) in exchange for receiving a 34% ownership stake in Mitsubishi Motors.

40|$|Abstract Conservation schemes often aim at {{increasing}} genetic diversity by minimizing kinship, {{and the best}} method to achieve this goal, when pedigree data is available, is to apply optimal contributions. Optimal contributions calculate contributions per animal so that the weighted average mean kinship among candidate parents is minimized. This approach assumes that pedigree data is correct and complete. However, in practice, pedigrees often contain errors: parents are recorded incorrectly or even missing. We used simulations to investigate {{the effect of these}} two types of errors on minimizing kinship. Our findings show that a low percentage of <b>wrong</b> parent <b>information</b> reduces the effect of optimal contributions. When the percentage of <b>wrong</b> parent <b>information</b> is above 15 %, the population structure and type of errors, should be taken into account before applying optimal contributions. Optimal contributions based on pedigrees with missing parent information hampers conservation of genetic diversity; however, missing parent information can be corrected. It is crucial to know which animals are founders. We strongly recommend that pedigree registration include whether missing parents are either true founders or non-founders. </p...|$|R

We attempted in vain to buy the boma, or fetish-drum, a venerable piece of furniture hung round with human crania, of which only the roofs remained. King Blay, however, eventually sent us home a boma, and it was duly exhibited in town. Kikam was the only place in Apollonia where we met with churlish treatment; no hospitality, however, could be expected when the strangers were supposed to be mixed up in a native quarrel.|$|E
