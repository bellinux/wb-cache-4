These lists associated each Upanishad <b>with</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the four Vedas, many such lists exist, and these lists are inconsistent across India in terms of which Upanishads are included and how the newer Upanishads are assigned to the ancient Vedas. In south India, the collected list based on Muktika Upanishad, and published in Telugu language, became the most common by the 19th-century {{and this is a}} list of 108 Upanishads.
