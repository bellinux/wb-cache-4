After that test, each organization was allowed four 2-day tests. Each test {{was required to}} be at a different race track. Rookie drivers were allocated an additional test.

25|$|Fires {{will often}} break out during a dry season, {{but in some}} areas {{wildfires}} may also commonly occur {{during a time of}} year when lightning is prevalent. The frequency over a span of years at which fire <b>will</b> <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> a particular location is a measure of how common wildfires are in a given ecosystem. It is either defined as the average interval between fires at a given site, or the average interval between fires in an equivalent specified area.|$|E
25|$|The {{negative}} sign {{means that}} work is done on the gas by the surroundings. Process irreversibilities (such as in heat transfer) will result in less energy being recovered from the expansion process than {{is required for the}} compression process. If the environment is at a constant temperature, for example, the thermal resistance in the intercoolers will mean that the compression occurs at a temperature somewhat higher than the ambient temperature, and the expansion <b>will</b> <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> a temperature somewhat lower than ambient temperature. So a perfect isothermal storage system is impossible to achieve.|$|E

25|$|Fog {{and clouds}} form through {{condensation}} around cloud condensation nuclei. In {{the absence of}} nuclei, condensation <b>will</b> only <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> much lower temperatures.

25|$|Trees {{should not}} be labeled as polluters because their total {{benefits}} on air quality and emissions reduction far outweigh the possible consequences of BVOC emissions on ozone concentrations. Emission of BVOCs increase exponentially with temperature. Therefore, higher emissions <b>will</b> <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> higher temperatures. In desert climates, locally native trees adapted to drought conditions emit significantly less BVOCs than plants native to wet regions. As discussed above, the formation of ozone is also temperature dependent. Thus, {{the best way to}} slow the production of ozone and emission of BVOCs is to reduce urban temperatures and the effect of the urban heat island. As suggested earlier, {{the most effective way to}} lower temperatures is with an increased canopy cover.|$|E
25|$|Metolazone {{may also}} be used in renal (kidney) disease, such as chronic renal failure or the {{nephrotic}} syndrome. Chronic renal failure causes excess fluid retention that is often treated with diet adjustments and diuretics. Metolazone may be combined with other diuretics (typically loop diuretics) to treat diuretic resistance in CHF, chronic renal failure, and nephrotic syndrome. Metolazone and a loop diuretic will synergistically enhance diuresis {{over the use of}} either agent alone. Using this combination, diuretic effects <b>will</b> <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> two different segments of the nephron; namely, the loop diuretic will act at the loop of Henle, and metolazone will act at the distal convoluted tubule. Metolazone is frequently prescribed in addition to the loop diuretic. Metolazone may be used for edema caused by liver cirrhosis as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} potential is explained here {{since it is}} the true driving force for the transport of water in both liquid and vapour phases in wood (Siau, 1984). The Gibbs free energy per mole of substance is usually expressed as the {{chemical potential}} (Skaar, 1933). The chemical potential of unsaturated air or wood below the fibre saturation point influences the drying of wood. Equilibrium <b>will</b> <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> the equilibrium moisture content (as defined earlier) of wood when the chemical potential of the wood becomes equal to that of the surrounding air. The chemical potential of sorbed water is a function of wood moisture content. Therefore, a gradient of wood moisture content (between surface and centre), or more specifically of activity, is accompanied by a gradient of chemical potential under isothermal conditions. Moisture will redistribute itself throughout the wood until the chemical potential is uniform throughout, resulting in a zero potential gradient at equilibrium (Skaar, 1988). The flux of moisture attempting to achieve the equilibrium state is assumed to be proportional to the difference in chemical potential, and inversely proportional to the path length over which the potential difference acts (Keey et al., 2000).|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{geometrical}} {{structures and}} electronical properties, {{as well as}} hydrogen storage of Al-doped boron nitride nanotube have been investigated using first principles based on density functional theory. The {{results show that the}} symmetry of boron nitride nanotube is destroyed slightly by doping one Al atom. Furthermore, physical absorption is found due to the small average absorption energy of Al-BNNT-nH 2, which indicates that this hydrogen absorption <b>will</b> <b>occurs</b> <b>at</b> room temperature. In addition, some novel structures presenting almost same absorption behaviors are predicted, which will offer useful information to future experimental investigation on the design of hydrogen storage materials...|$|R

25|$|Many species exhibit density-dependent {{dispersal}} {{and habitat}} selection. For species exhibiting this pattern, dispersal into what {{would otherwise be}} sub-optimal habitats can occur when local abundances are high in high quality habitats (see Source-sink dynamics, thus increasing {{the size of the}} species geographic range. An initial argument against this hypothesis is that when a species colonizes formerly empty habitats, the average abundance of that species across all occupied habitats drops, negating an O–A relationship. However, all species <b>will</b> <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> low densities in some occupied habitats, while only the abundant species will be able to reach high densities in some of their occupied habitats. Thus it is expected that both common and uncommon species will have similar minimum densities in occupied habitats, but that it is the maximum densities obtained by common species in some habitats that drive the positive relationship between mean densities and AOO. If density-dependent habitat selection were to determine positive O–A relationships, the distribution of a species would follow an Ideal Free Distribution (IFD). Gaston et al. cites Tyler and Hargrove who examined the IFD using simulation models and found several instances (e.g. when resources had a fractal distribution, or when the scale of resource distribution poorly matched the organisms dispersal capabilities) where IFDs poorly described species distributions.|$|E

The DVD version of Super Junior Japan Limited Special Edition– Super Show 3 also debuted at number two, while the CD version debuted at number 10. The album also debuted at number 5 and remained at number three spot on the Oricon Daily Chart for two consecutive days and number six on the Oricon Weekly Chart. Following their commercial success in Japan, the group released a Japanese version of Bonamanas self-titled single in June 2011, which debuted at number two on the Oricon Daily Singles chart, selling over 59,000 copies the first week of release, however, SM did not see the release as their official Japanese debut and has stated that their debut in Japan <b>will</b> <b>occur</b> <b>at</b> a later time.|$|E

2500|$|Touchdown {{polymerase}} {{chain reaction}} or touchdown style {{polymerase chain reaction}} is a method of polymerase chain reaction by which primers will avoid amplifying nonspecific sequences.
