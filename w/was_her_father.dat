5|$|Jane Austen lived {{her entire}} life {{as part of a}} large and close-knit family on the lower fringes of the English gentry. Her family's steadfast support was {{critical}} to Austen's development as a professional writer. Austen read draft versions of all of her novels to her family, receiving feedback and encouragement, and it <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> who sent out her first publication bid. Austen's artistic apprenticeship lasted from her teenage years until she was about thirty-five. During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the epistolary novel which she tried and then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth. With the release of Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814) and Emma (1815), she achieved success as a published writer.|$|E

2500|$|Hatshepsut {{claimed that}} she <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>father's</b> {{intended}} heir {{and that he}} made her the heir apparent of Egypt. Almost all scholars today view this as historical revisionism, or prolepsis, on Hatshepsut's part since it was Thutmose II—a son of Thutmose I by Mutnofret—who <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>father's</b> heir. Moreover, Thutmose I could not have foreseen that his daughter Hatshepsut would outlive his son within his own lifetime. Thutmose II soon married Hatshepsut and the latter became both his senior royal wife and the most powerful woman at court. Biographer Evelyn Wells, however, accepts Hatshepsut's claim that she <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>father's</b> intended successor. Once she became pharaoh herself, Hatshepsut supported her assertion that she <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>father's</b> designated successor with inscriptions {{on the walls of}} her mortuary temple: ...|$|R

25|$|When she was 31 {{years old}} and {{five years after the}} death of Clark Gable, Lewis finally confronted her mother about her true parentage. Loretta {{confirmed}} that she was her biological mother and Gable <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>father.</b> Young never publicly acknowledged the fact while she was alive, which she said would be admitting to a mortal sin. However, she finally gave her biographer permission to include the information on the condition that the book not be published until after her death. She died on August 12, 2000, at the age of 87 of ovarian cancer. Judy Lewis died at age 76 on November 25, 2011, also of cancer.|$|E
25|$|Judy Lewis was Gable's {{only child}} born {{while he was}} alive. Nineteen months after the birth, Young claimed to have adopted Judy. The girl grew up {{resembling}} Gable very much, including having large ears that stuck out. She went by the name Judy Lewis after her mother married Tom Lewis when Judy was four years old. According to Lewis, Gable visited her home once, when she was 15, asked about her life, and kissed her on her forehead upon leaving. He did not tell {{her that he was}} her biological father. Neither Gable nor Young would ever publicly acknowledge the truth about their daughter, but most in Hollywood and some in the general public believed Gable <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>father,</b> due, in part, to their strong resemblance and the timing of her birth.|$|E

25|$|Her {{father was}} Sir Bache Cunard, an {{heir to the}} Cunard Line {{shipping}} businesses, interested in polo and fox hunting, and a baronet. Her mother was Maud Alice Burke an American heiress, who adopted the first name Emerald and became a leading London society hostess. Nancy had been brought up on the family estate at Nevill Holt, Leicestershire but when her parents separated in 1911 she moved to London with her mother. Her education was at various boarding schools, including time in France and Germany. Whilst in London she {{spent a good deal}} of her childhood with her mother's long time admirer, the novelist George Moore. Indeed, it was even rumoured that Moore <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>father,</b> and though this has been largely dismissed, there is no question that he played an important role whilst she was growing up. She would later write a memoir about her affection for 'GM'.|$|E
25|$|Lake {{told her}} friends and family that Davies became {{pregnant}} by Hearst in the early 1920s. As the child was conceived during Hearst's extra-marital affair with Davies and out of wedlock, Hearst sent Davies to Europe to have the child in secret to avoid a public scandal. Hearst later joined Davies in Europe. Lake claimed {{she was born in}} a Catholic hospital outside of Paris between 1920 and 1923 (she was unsure of the precise date). Lake was then given to Davies' sister Rose, whose own child had died in infancy, and passed off as Rose and her husband George Van Cleve's daughter. Lake stated that Hearst paid for her schooling and both Davies and Hearst spent considerable time with her. Davies reportedly told Lake of her true parentage when she was 11 years old. Lake said Hearst confirmed that he <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> on her wedding day at age 17 where both Davies and Hearst gave her away.|$|E

500|$|Collins has listed {{two main}} sources of {{influence}} in her writing of The Underland Chronicles. First is her M.F.A. in dramatic writing and her experience as a screenwriter. This writing experience resulted in her structuring books [...] "like a three-act play", and {{paying close attention to}} the plot's pacing. Gregor and the Curse of the Warmbloods came third in [...] "a series of narratives that are interrelated yet can stand on their own", a fact not missed by reviewers. Collins' other source of inspiration <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>father</b> Michael Collins, a lieutenant colonel in the United States Air Force, who provided her with advice about the war tactics used in her books, and also instilled in her an [...] "impulse to educate young people about the realities of war".|$|E
500|$|Chopra's main vocal {{influence}} <b>was</b> <b>her</b> <b>father,</b> who {{she said}} was [...] "an incredible singer", and helped develop her interest in singing.

Her first recording, the song [...] "Ullathai Killathe" [...] in the Tamil film Thamizhan (2002), was made {{at the urging of}} her director and co-star, Vijay (who had noticed her singing on the set). She declined to sing playback for [...] "Tinka Tinka" [...] in her film Karam (2005), preferring to concentrate on her acting career, but later sang the song live on the television programme Sa Re Ga Ma Pa. Chopra recorded an unreleased song for Bluffmaster! (2005). In August 2011, Universal Music Group signed Chopra to a worldwide recording agreement with DesiHits. The deal indicated that her first studio album would be released by Interscope Records in North America and by Island Records elsewhere.|$|E

She was an early and voracious reader. Her first book was Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, which she kept well into adulthood until [...] "some fiend in human form must have borrowed it and not brought it back". She visited Florida when she was four years old, and her most vivid memory of the trip was picking an orange from a tree at the Tampa Bay Hotel.

500|$|Such was her {{domination}} of the sport that there were persistent rumours that she was actually a man. These first surfaced immediately after her first match, when {{the members of the}} opposition Ottawa side accused her of being a man. The accusation was not unfounded in the league, where it was not uncommon for boys to be disguised as women to improve the spectacle. Some opposition teams went as far as removing Lapensée's hat during games to check how long her hair <b>was.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>father</b> made a public statement that the claims were false, and in February 1916, the Montreal Star investigated the claims.
