[...] If he believes that, why not step down last week <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> him to? [...] He was cock-a-hoop {{when he won the}} election and terribly arrogant.

He stated, [...] "I got the name from a magazine... <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>asked</b> them if we could use the name for our business, they said go right ahead." [...] In 1965, {{the creator of the}} Archie comic series, Bob Montana, drew the jester that appears on every Funspot token. Montana, who resided in Meredith, New Hampshire, created the jester in the likeness of his character Jughead. Funspot's mascot is [...] "Topsnuf" [...] the dragon.

There would have been ways to make this film less of a no-brainer. The ambiguity could have been about something much deeper than metal: It could have been about whether other systems really do feel, or just {{act as if they}} feel, and how we could possibly know that, or tell the difference, and what difference that difference could really make [...] but that film would have had to be called "TT" (for Turing Test) rather than "AI" or "ET," and it would have had to show (while keeping in touch with our "cuddly" feelings) how we are exactly in the same boat <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> this question about one another as <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> it about "robots. ...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge {{acquisition}} is <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> experts questions, and put {{the answers}} into the computer system. Since {{this is a very}} time-consuming task, it is desirable to minimize the effort of an expert. As a crude estimate for this effort, we can take a number of binary (yes-no) questions that <b>we</b> <b>ask.</b> The procedure that minimizes this number is binary search. This approach {{does not take into account}} that people often feel more comfortable answering "yes" than answering "no". So, to make our estimates more realistic, we will take into consideration that for a negative answer the effort is bigger. This paper describes a procedure that minimizes the effort of an expert. We also estimate the effort of this "optimal" search procedure. 1 Introduction to the Problem 1. 1 Informal Introduction Knowledge acquisition is <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>ask</b> experts questions, {{and put the}} answers into the computer system.
