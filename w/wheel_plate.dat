5000|$|During the {{production}} run several modifications would be made, {{such as the}} fitting of lifting hooks. The first thirty vehicles had two more primitive periscopes on the turret roof, a Chrétien diascope on its front and simple vision slits with armoured shutters on its sides; their drivers too had to use vision slits instead of an episcope. They also lacked a silencer and had semi-circular cut-outs at the <b>wheel</b> <b>plate</b> edges. From about the 111th vehicle (or fourth production batch) onward, several changes were introduced, including the fitting of an armoured ventilator covering {{on top of the}} turret, a factory plate with the name [...] "Panhard" [...] on the nose and a new softer factory camouflage pattern with the brown and bronze green spots no longer separated by black lines. From the 270th vehicle onwards stowage boxes were constructed on the back fenders, obscuring the pointed form of the engine compartment. The last turrets produced also had a backward pointing episcope for the commander, instead of a vision slit.|$|E
40|$|The wheel has a {{wheel rim}} {{comprising}} a running surface (6), where a wheel hub (2) and the wheel rim {{are connected to}} a <b>wheel</b> <b>plate</b> (8). The wheel rim and the <b>wheel</b> <b>plate</b> are connected {{with one another in}} a form fit manner by an inner circumference intervention structure of the rim and an external periphery intervention structure of the <b>wheel</b> <b>plate.</b> Internal gears (10) of the wheel rim and external teeth (12) of the <b>wheel</b> <b>plate</b> are designed as shaft gear teeth. The <b>wheel</b> <b>plate</b> is supported in axial direction at a supporting portion for the wheel rim...|$|E
30|$|At 48 -h post-fertilization (hpf) {{the heart}} is formed in two {{chambers}} {{and it is possible}} to count a regular heartbeat. The heartbeat rate was assessed by direct observation of the heart of the 5 randomly chosen embryos for 10  s. Heartbeat was counted manually and measurement time did not exceed 2  min to avoid temperature drops. From 72 hpf the hatching rate becomes stable for most of the larvae. The numbers of hatched embryos were counted at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hpf. An embryo was considered hatched when its body completely left the chorion. After 96 -h embryos were selected for further locomotor activity (LA) determination [38]. For the evaluation of LA, 16 embryos for each sample and negative control were transferred to a 96 <b>wheel</b> <b>plate</b> with rectangular angles (one embryo per wheel, with 500  µL of clean ISO water). A randomized plate set-up was used to avoid interference in behavioral analyses. LA was only assessed for samples with mortality below 50 % and a hatching rate above 50 %. LA was registered over 50  min at a light/dark regime of 10 -min dark, 20 -min light and 20 -min dark. Embryonic movement was tracked using the ZebraBox video tracking system (Viewpoint, Lyon, France) at a temperature of 28 [*]±[*] 1  °C. Prior to the measurements, embryos were acclimated in the device for at least 10  min.|$|E

50|$|Duplo bricks were {{introduced}} in 1969, in four colors: red, yellow, blue, and white. The following year, two more sets were added with blue and red <b>wheel</b> <b>plates.</b> In the product catalog for 1971, the sets were described as being for children from 1 to 2 years, but were still sold mixed with Lego bricks, normally designed for ages 3 to 12.

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a brief overview}} on the results obtained during the scale model landing gear test in the Acoustic Wind Tunnel Braunschweig 1. Noise tests were conducted on different 4 -wheel landing gear configurations with (i) deceleration plates and (ii) splitter plates. The results presented in this report indicate that deceleration plates when attached between the rear wheels downstream of the axle tend to reduce the farfield radiated landing gear noise by up to 4 dB. In {{the course of this}} test best results were obtained by means of an inner <b>wheel</b> deceleration <b>plate</b> in combination with a short lower leg deceleration plate. The installation of an upper leg deceleration plate was not effective in terms of noise reduction. For splitter plates when applied to several gear components different results were obtained. While the <b>wheel</b> splitter <b>plates</b> tend to increase noise levels nearly no effect was measured for splitter plates located at the main strut and the side stay. A slight noise reduction of about 1 dB was documented for both the torque link and the drag stay splitter plate configuration. The noise test on a 2 -wheel landing gear again proved the beneficial effect of an inner <b>wheel</b> deceleration <b>plate</b> on farfield radiated noise. ...|$|R

50|$|The Cannone da 149/35 A {{was a heavy}} gun {{which served}} with Italy during World War I and World War II. It was already an old-fashioned weapon when {{introduced}} around 1900. It lacked a recoil system of any kind and could not traverse. The gun recoiled up two ramps placed behind the wheels {{and had to be}} re-laid after every shot. <b>Wheel</b> <b>plates</b> were added to absorb more recoil energy and to help the gun cross soft ground. Despite these serious drawbacks it seems to have been produced in large numbers as some 895 were in Italian service on June 1940. Weapons captured by the Germans after the Italian surrender in 1943 seem to have been scrapped or ignored as there is no record of them in German service.|$|R
5000|$|This device has no drivetrain, so when forward inertia {{runs out}} {{due to gravity}} and friction, the ride ends.

40|$|Dear Sir or Madam, My name is David Longman and I {{am looking}} a {{position}} in race engineering, engineering design or race mechanics. Over the last 10 years, I have combined my motorsports experience with formal education to enhance my race engineering design skills. I am currently working as an engineer at Porter's Fabrications, a multi-million dollar manufacturing facility. On a daily basis I deal with complex engineering drawings which require prototype construction and I determine the methods for manufacturing. These methods include laser cutting, bending/forming, machining, welding and powder coating. I graduated from UNC-Charlotte {{with a degree in}} mechanical engineering, physics, a math minor and a concentration in motorsports. Having this vast amount of education has helped me with my problem solving skills and knowing where to look for answers. In my senior year, I designed and built a revolutionary alignment rig for the Formula SAE car. The rigs accuracy was based on the true axis of wheel rotation not on how true parts where machined. This allowed the user to measure toe and camber free wheel or tool defects. Lastly, I used system of conveyor rollers, <b>wheel</b> <b>plates,</b> plumb bobs and corner weight scales {{for the rest of the}} rig...|$|R
5000|$|In 1846 James Boydell had {{obtained}} a patent in Britain for a steam traction engine with [...] "Dreadnaught Wheels", where each <b>wheel</b> had hinged <b>plates</b> attached loosely {{at regular intervals}} around {{the outside of the}} rim.

The <b>plates</b> alternated {{on each side of the}} rim, which was split, to give a smoother ride.

50|$|A Hollander beater design {{consists}} of a circular or ovoid water raceway with a beater wheel at a single point along the raceway.

Under power, the blades rotate to beat the fiber into a usable pulp slurry. The beater <b>wheel</b> and <b>plate</b> do not touch, as this would result in cutting. The distance between the two is adjusted to increase or decrease the pressure on the fibers when passing through the beater.|$|R

25|$|As a plateway, the Middlebere Plateway {{differed}} from the edge railway that eventually became the norm, in that the flanges retaining the truck wheels on the line were on the rails (plates) {{rather than on the}} <b>wheels.</b> The <b>plates</b> were three feet long, L-shaped and made of cast iron, weighing 40lb. They were supported on stone sleepers weighing 60-70lb; the ends of the plates were held down by nails driven into wooden plugs inserted into holes in the sleepers. The gauge is generally quoted as being about 3 feet 9 inches, although some recent archeological investigations suggest it may have been as narrow as 3 feet 6 inches.|$|R
