40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the efficiency of agrochemicals use in fields and to reduce environmental impact it is compulsory to assure a better distribution uniformity of solution on the <b>working</b> <b>width</b> of machines used for agrochemicals applications. In this paper was determined {{the way in which the}} distribution uniformity is influenced by boom position with regard to the target surface and by the liquid pressure at nozzle.

40|$|A {{common problem}} faced in fabric {{manufacturing}} is {{the production of}} inconsistent fabric width on shuttleless looms {{in spite of the}} same fabric specifications. Weft-wise crimp controls the fabric width and it depends on a number of factors, including warp tension, temple type, fabric take-up pressing tension and loom <b>working</b> <b>width.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the effect of these parameters on the fabric width produced. Taguchi’s orthogonal design was used to optimise the weaving parameters for obtaining controlled fabric width. On the basis of signal to noise ratios, it could be concluded that controlled fabric width could be produced using medium temple type and intense take-up pressing tension at relatively lower warp tension and smaller loom <b>working</b> <b>width.</b> The analysis of variance revealed that temple needle size was the most significant factor affecting the fabric width, followed by loom <b>working</b> <b>width</b> and warp tension, whereas take-up pressing tension was least significant of all the factors investigated in the study...|$|E
40|$|As the <b>working</b> <b>width</b> of sowing {{implements}} increases, the use {{of conventional}} mechanical seed drills, with hoppers above all the implement <b>working</b> <b>width,</b> has reachedits limits. Any further increase of the <b>working</b> <b>width</b> (more than 4 - 6 m) or the coupling of conventional additional apparatus is expensive, complex and time-consuming. Air-seeding appears thus as the best solution to solve this problem. One storage hopper is able to supply the <b>working</b> <b>width</b> of 24 m or more. However, it should be noticed that to ensure uniform crop growing, a machine needs an accurate, technical solution to ensure seeding material to be distributed across the full implement <b>working</b> <b>width.</b> Indeed, low transversal distribution accuracy {{is one of the}} most important shortcomings of modem air-seeders. Even if air-seeding has been used for more than 50 years, few developments have been carried out on divider headers responsible for distribution accuracy. This paper deals with a study on the influence of divider head geometry and functioning conditions on the seed's distribution accuracy. The first part concerns the study of the influence of the air velocity and the material flow rate on the distribution accuracy. A second study deals with the influence of the outlet closing, of different outlet pipes lengths, of distribution head tightness, of the angle position of distribution heads. Finally the influence of the structural elements such as the pipe elbow, the tower configurations, the tower height and the cone shape deflectors' implementation on the divider lid is proposed. Moreover, observation of the seed's behaviour is undertaken using a high-speed camera system. These experimental results allowed for proposals of hypothesis about the parameters influencing the final result. This paper also proposes theoretical and mathematical explanations of the observed effects, necessary for future divider heads design...|$|E

This applies {{to a wide}} range of particulates when open-plan coulter layouts are used to improve residue passage during zero tillage and reduced tillage as well as for close row spacing on cultivated ground.

40|$|When sowing grain {{we apply}} {{resource}} saving technologies-technologies such as «no till» and a technology called «mini-till». «No till» involves planting crops on untreated surfaces. "Mini-till" {{is designed for}} the planting with minimum tillage. During {{the movement of the}} sowing unit on these agricultural backgrounds we can see working bodies tipping out. Stabilization of the drilling depth is ensured in two ways - by moving part of the weight of the planter on the opener or the installation of ballast weights. Openers of grain drills for resource saving technologies for grain crops can be divided into three groups – foot, disc and anchor. Disc coulter has varieties – single disc, double disc and montesquiu coulter. To analyze the cost of power for the operation of the opener, the following indicators – the minimum engine power of the tractor on the coulter and engine power of tractors per unit of <b>working</b> <b>width.</b> The calculation of the indicators was conducted using data the technical specifications of the planter. Snow coulter drill AGRATOR 4800 provides a wide spread planting strip of 10 - 15 cm.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the influence of longitudinal barriers located on the medianstrips and hard shoulders of toll motorways on crash severity in vehicles running off the roadway. Thestudy was based on crashes involving injury and property damage only, recorded from 1996 to 2010 ona French toll motorway network of about 2000 km. In run-off from the roadway onto the hard shoulder, injury risk was halved by a longitudinal barrier. A specific one-sided W-beam guardrail (“GS 4 ”) appeared to be the best solution for cars, and even forLUVs and trucks. This does not affect the advisability of specific guardrails for bridges or of concretebarriers, when narrow <b>working</b> <b>widths</b> are required. In run-off onto median strips, a specific guardrail(“GS 2 ”) appeared to be the most efficient, followed by the three other metal guardrails currently installed. Concrete barriers, however, are much more effective in preventing complete crossing of the median,which is uncommon and mainly involves trucks, but often with very serious consequences. Longitudinal barriers make an important contribution to highway-user safety, providing a “forgiving”infrastructure in the event of a vehicle going off the road, provided that there are very few motorizedtwo-wheel vehicles using the roadway...|$|R
40|$|As {{the need}} for timely {{applications}} of crop protection products is more pronounced but farm sizes are growing the needed capacity for spraying is apart from increasing <b>working</b> <b>widths</b> more often managed by speeding up sprayers. This can be done as boom sprayers {{are more and more}} having good suspension systems that allow higher speeds in the field with minimal sprayer boom movements. However little is known on what the effect of sprayer speed is on spray drift. In a series of experiments the effect of sprayer speeds of 6 and 12 km/h is evaluated. The experiments are performed with two nozzle types; a standard flat fan (XR 11004) and a low drift pre-orifice flat fan nozzle (DG 11004), both sprayed at 3 bar pressure. These combinations were sprayed both with and without air assistance (Hardi Twin Force). Spray drift was measured to the soil surface next to a sprayed potato field. Also airborne drift at 5 m distance {{from the edge of the}} field was measured. Results show an increase in spray drift with increasing speed. The effect of the low drift nozzle could not compensate for the increase in spray drift because of the increase in sprayer speed.

40|$|In {{agricultural}} mowing operations, {{thousands of}} animals are injured or killed each year, {{due to the}} increased <b>working</b> <b>widths</b> and speeds of agricultural machinery. Detection and recognition of wildlife within the agricultural fields is important to reduce wildlife mortality and, thereby, promote wildlife-friendly farming. The work {{presented in this paper}} contributes to the automated detection and classification of animals in thermal imaging. The methods and results are based on top-view images taken manually from a lift to motivate work towards unmanned aerial vehicle-based detection and recognition. Hot objects are detected based on a threshold dynamically adjusted to each frame. For the classification of animals, we propose a novel thermal feature extraction algorithm. For each detected object, a thermal signature is calculated using morphological operations. The thermal signature describes heat characteristics of objects and is partly invariant to translation, rotation, scale and posture. The discrete cosine transform (DCT) is used to parameterize the thermal signature and, thereby, calculate a feature vector, which is used for subsequent classification. Using a k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) classifier, animals are discriminated from non-animals with a balanced classification accuracy of 84. 7 % in an altitude range of 3 – 10 m and an accuracy of 75. 2 % for an altitude range of 10 – 20 m. To incorporate temporal information in the classification, a tracking algorithm is proposed.

Although {{the performance of the}} MGS and the dynamic deflection and <b>working</b> <b>width</b> of the barrier have been examined, {{little is known about the}} dynamic deflection and <b>working</b> <b>width</b> of the MGS when impacted at lower speeds. The MGS is a relatively low-cost barrier, and the Test Level 3 (TL- 3) version could be installed for TL- 2 and TL- 1 applications. The barrier is expected to capture or redirect errant vehicles impacting at speeds less than or equal to those used for crash testing according to TL- 3 of the Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH). Accurate dynamic deflections and working widths of the MGS when impacted at lower speeds are critical for the safe placement of guardrail to reduce the likelihood of vehicle impact with a shielded hazard in the Zone of Intrusion (ZOI) for use on level terrain and in combination with curbs. LS-DYNA computer simulation models of a 2007 Chevrolet Silverado impacting both a tangent MGS and MGS in combination with a curb at a 6 -ft 3 -in.

Additionally, sowing equipment with broader <b>working</b> <b>width</b> can be used. Both technologies save working time and fuel.
