It collects precipitation, {{holds the}} water in a covered tank to minimize evaporation and maintain adequate water quality, and dispenses water on demand into a basin from which animals can drink.

40|$|Ever since arsenic {{contamination}} of groundwater {{was discovered in}} Bangladesh in the 1990 ’s, several international organizations and NGOs have been constructing safe <b>water</b> <b>devices</b> for mitigating the associated problems. However, many such safe <b>water</b> <b>devices</b> were abandoned {{due to lack of}} maintenance. This article analyzes how and why the use of these devices had stopped, through the use of interviews made with officials of the device operating committees. It was found that, in one example, an active safe <b>water</b> <b>device</b> had a well-organized operating committee, headed by a leading member of the community who was held in high regard. In contrast, an inactive safe <b>water</b> <b>device</b> in a neighboring village was found to have an unstable organizing committee; in this case an unmotivated community leader who had his own access to safe drinking water. The maintenance of safe <b>water</b> <b>devices</b> therefore greatly depends on leadership in the community. A future concern should see the implementation of methods of sustainable device maintenance that is free from the issues of community unity and/or leadership. 国民の９割が地下水を飲用に利用しているバングラデシュでは 1990 年代に地下水砒素汚染が明らかになり問題になっている｡以降､国内外の機関によって対策活動として､安全な水を供給するための装置(代替水源装置) が建設されてきた｡しかし､建設された多くの代替水源装置において維持管理が適切に行われず結果的に放棄される例などが報告されている｡本研究は､代替水源装置の運営(維持管理) がどうして､どのように立ち行かなくなっていくのかということについて､装置の管理組合の役員にインタビューを行い､明らかにするものである｡順調に稼動している代替水源装置においては､尊敬されている人物が組合のリーダーを務めておりその人物を中心として利用世帯がまとまっていたり､日常的に装置のメンテナンスを行う人物の存在が見られた｡一方､維持管理が放棄されている代替水源装置においては､組合のリーダーや､コミュニティ全体に関連する問題が見られた｡今後､放棄される代替水源装置の数を減らし､代替水源装置によって安定的に安全な水を供給するためには､いいリーダーがいない､又はまとまって何かを解決することが難しいという地域社会において､どうすれば代替水源装置は安定的に稼動させることができるのかという点が重要な課題となるであろう...|$|R

40|$|Due {{to limited}} energy resources, {{excessive}} emission of CO 2, global warming, increase of mean temperature, serious impacts have resulted on our living environment, and thus, energy saving and carbon reduction have become urgent issues. Planting grass, flowers and trees can absorb and reduce CO 2, thus {{meeting the requirements}} for energy saving and carbon reduction in environmental protection. At present, most of lawns or gardens in Taiwan are maintained by manual or traditional semiautomatic <b>watering</b> <b>device.</b> Whether the lawn needs to be watered {{and the amount of}} water to be sprinkled depends on subjective decision. When the lawn is watered without examining the moisture content of the soil beforehand, it causes waste of time, labor, water and cost. The intelligent wind powered watering system developed by this study used an electromechanical integrated design system to control the humidity probe, and used the electricity generated by natural wind power and pumping device to control the sprinkling action. This system sprinkles water by sensing the soil moisture content, and stops sprinkling automatically when the soil moisture content is enough, thus achieving the purposes of cost and energy saving...|$|E
40|$|The {{transplant}} of the radicchio (Chicorium intybus L. var. silvestre Bishoff), a chicory variety {{cultivated in}} North-eastern Italy, {{is a very}} delicate operation because it is carried out in a period characterised by both high temperatures and elevated evapotranspiration and low precipitation. In the time range between the transplant and the taking root of the chicory plants (5 - 6 days), {{it is necessary to}} keep always wet the root zone. The possibility to put a minimum water amount closed to the plant roots, already during the transplanting operation, assures the success of this phase. The scope of this research is to verify the possibility of using a transplanting machine, with a <b>watering</b> <b>device</b> for wetting the soil around the module of the transplanted plants. Humic acids and pesticides are added to the water; therefore in this way they are distributed localised. During the first year of trials, positive effects are found on the percentage of the taking root of the chicory plants. At the end of the experimentation {{it will be possible to}} estimate the possibility of a real use of the machine by the farmers...|$|E
40|$|This {{project is}} {{investigating}} the drinking water quality of Iowa dairy cattle and the effect drinking water quality has on performance. There were 128 dairy farms participating in this study;For this study a novel method of sampling drinking water directly from drinking devices was utilized. There were 59 dairy farms using wells, 68 farms using rural water and 1 farm using spring water for the drinking water source. Contemporary production data was from DHIA records;The following parameters were measured, coliform, pH, total dissolved solids, nitrate, sulfate, and 22 minerals. A record of the type and amount of <b>watering</b> <b>devices</b> available for drinking water for lactating dairy cattle were taken. Linear inches available for drinking water space was determined {{as well as the}} frequency of cleaning of water devices;Preliminary results indicate that there are constituents of drinking water that appear to impact performance or reproduction of dairy cattle in Iowa. Elevated levels of nitrate, B, Ba, K, P and Mn in the drinking water {{have a negative effect on}} milk production. Elevated sulfate concentration in drinking water has a positive effect on milk production;Information about how drinking water was provided was also recorded. Positive effects on milk production were an increasing linear inches per cow available for drinking, the use of cups as drinking <b>water</b> <b>devices</b> and an increasing frequency of cleaning of <b>water</b> <b>devices.</b> An increasing distance from the feed bunk to the first available <b>water</b> <b>device</b> and not using drinking cup devices had a negative effect on milk production;Additional relationships of drinking water quality and the performance of Iowa dairy cattle are being delineated...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Small {{commercial}} and non-commercial animal enterprises (SCAEs) raise a few beef cows, horses, pigs, sheep, poultry, {{and other animals}} on a few acres. These enterprises are often located in suburban areas of watersheds and show potential for degrading water quality through to increased bacterial, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations. SCAEs implement Best Management Practices (BNIPs) {{on a voluntary basis}} to control their water quality impacts. Off-stream watering areas, with animal access to streams, and covered manure storages are two BMPs which were analyzed in this thesis for effectiveness in reducing bacteria, nitrogen, and phosphorus from entering surface and groundwater in four SCAEs. The four cooperating SCAEs were located in the Tualatin River Basin, and the potential water quality improvements from implementing these two practices in all SCAEs in the basin were discussed. The BMP analyses use results from several studies. Two of these studies analyzed off-stream watering areas for reducing time animals spend watering at the stream. This time was measured and used to estimate the manure defecated in the stream. Reducing time animals spend at the stream decreases direct defecations in the stream and reduces water quality impacts of SCAEs. A third study analyzed a pasture pump as a possible off-stream <b>watering</b> <b>device.</b> It was analyzed for its ability to provide water to 27 Holstein dairy heifers without limiting water consumption. Daily water consumption from the pasture pump was not significantly different than daily consumption from an open water trough. A fourth study predicted the rainfall required to produce runoff from pastured areas in the Dairy-McKay Hydrological Unit Area within the Tualatin River Basin. These required rainfall amounts and runoff frequency were predicted for summer and winter soil conditions. The BMPs were analyzed for a variety of wet and dry conditions during the summer and winter. Off-stream watering areas were most effective in reducing water quality impacts of SCAEs for dry conditions during the summer and winter, while the covered manure storages were most effective during winter days of continuous rain. Off-stream watering areas reduced the time animals spent at the stream by 75...|$|E
