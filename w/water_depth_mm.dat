Solar stills have been considered {{as one of the}} viable options of converting brackish or dirty water into distil <b>water.</b> Basin <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> is one of the design and operating parameters that determines the performance of solar still. Therefore, three identical simple basin single slope solar stills A, B, and C were constructed and their performance was experimentally investigated under the same conditions at basin <b>water</b> <b>depths</b> of 5 <b>mm,</b> 10 mm and 20 mm respectively. The distillate productivity, solar intensity, and the temperatures of the basin water, glass cover and the ambient of the three stills were measured and their relationships were investigated. The heat losses as well as the experimental and thermal efficiencies of the stills were estimated. The results reveal that still A demonstrates high performance followed by still B.

This {{study examined the}} effects of water temperature on the growth of Triops longicaudatus. The influence of water temperature fluctuations was that growth rate was increased at higher temperatures.

The mean carapace length grew rapidly within 14 days after submergence, but increase in carapace length beyond this time was slow.

The formulation of the model is based on the description of the tire/wet road contact area. The friction coefficient is expressed as the product of a 'dry' friction coefficient by a function expressing the actions of water. It was stated that this function is a product of four weighting functions expressing respectively the water intrusion - due to the speed and the <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> - and the water drainage - thanks to the road surface macrotexture and the tire tread depth. It was shown that existing friction models are a special case of the proposed model. The model was calibrated by friction measurements issued from an exhaustive test campaign conducted at Ifsttar's test track. The test program includes 2 commercial tire types, 3 road surfaces, 6 speeds, 3 <b>water</b> <b>depths</b> and 3 tire tread depths. It was shown that the model fits remarkably well experimental data, except for very high <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> (8 <b>mm)</b> at high speed (over 80 km/h). Considering the fact that these conditions induce mechanisms like dragging that are not considered in the model and that the <b>water</b> <b>depths</b> used by friction monitoring devices generally are lower than 1 mm, it was considered that the proposed model is satisfactory.

In most cases, ponds, streams, wells and rivers are often polluted that they are unsafe for direct use as drinking water. Often water sources are brackish and or contain harmful bacteria. Therefore cannot be used for drinking. In addition there are many coastal locations where sea water is abundant but potable water is not available. Solar distillation is one of the important methods of utilizing solar energy for the supply of potable water to small communities where natural supply of fresh water is inadequate or of poor quality. In this direction an experimental performance analysis was carried out on a single basin still compared with FPC coupled one. Test were carried out for different water samples namely borewell water, sea water, river water for a <b>water</b> <b>depth</b> of 20 <b>mm.</b> Measurement of various temperatures solar intensity, distillate water collected from north and south slope were taken for several days under local climatic conditions. The study shows that single basin still productivity enhances by 42 percent for borewell water, 40 percent for sea water and 45 percent for river water when the still coupled with FPC Flat Plate Collector,The various other tests like chlorine content, Total hardness, Calcium content, Electrical conductivity, TDS, pH value, were carried out in the laboratory and found that water is safe and pure for drinking. Solar distillation becomes very attractive in expensive long term low technology system especially useful where the need for small plant exist...|$|R
