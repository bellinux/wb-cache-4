5|$|At a diner called Winkie's, a man {{tells his}} {{companion}} about a nightmare {{in which he}} dreamt there was a horrible figure behind the diner. When they investigate, the figure appears, causing {{the man with the}} nightmare to collapse in fright. Elsewhere, director Adam Kesher has his film commandeered by mobsters, <b>who</b> <b>insist</b> he cast an unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes as the lead in his film. Adam resists, but after being thrown out of his house when he finds his wife cheating on him, he learns that his bank has closed his line of credit and he is broke. He agrees to meet a mysterious figure called The Cowboy, who urges him to cast Camilla Rhodes for his own good. Later, a bungling hit man attempts to steal a book full of phone numbers and leaves three people dead.|$|E

25|$|Controlled {{tests have}} not shown {{breathing}} nitrox {{to reduce the}} effects of nitrogen narcosis, as oxygen seems to have similarly narcotic properties under pressure to nitrogen; thus one should not expect a reduction in narcotic effects due only {{to the use of}} nitrox.

25|$|The play {{is still}} disputed by those involved, {{particularly}} by living personnel from the Raiders and their fans, <b>who</b> <b>insist</b> the Raiders should have won. Tatum {{said that the}} ball did not bounce off him, both immediately after the game as well as later; however, in his memoirs, Tatum equivocated, stating {{that he could not}} honestly say if the ball hit him. Raiders linebacker Phil Villapiano, who was covering Harris at the time, maintains that the ball hit Fuqua. Fuqua has been coy, supposedly saying he knows exactly what happened that day but will never tell.|$|E

25|$|Dongalor and his advisor Barnabus (Alex MacQueen) try {{to extract}} tears from the kidnapped women by torturing them, {{whipping}} them and peeling onions {{in front of}} them, to no avail. Dongalor also tries staging a tragic play with a boy saying goodbye to his dog because his father cannot afford the pet due {{to the death of}} his mother, but the Pagan women are unmoved, although Dongalor cries like a baby. Meanwhile, Longshaft tells Kröd and his three friends to go to the Hessemeel Mountains, through the Forest of Certain Death, and light a pyre {{at the top of a}} tower to warn the other freedom fighters about the pending danger. The foursome go through the forest, where they find a strong man has been savagely killed. They are approached by three beautiful wenches, <b>who</b> <b>insist</b> a group of banshees just tried to kill them. When they seek romance from the group, the homosexual Bruce is the only one who is skeptical, until the wenches bring a gay man from the forest for him. The wenches, who are revealed to be Succubi, impregnate Loquasto and Zezelryck after kissing them, as does the Incubus after kissing Bruce.|$|E
500|$|Neonatal {{circumcision}} {{is usually}} {{elected by the}} parents for non-medical reasons, such as religious beliefs or personal preferences, possibly driven by societal norms. Outside the parts of Africa with high prevalence of HIV/AIDS, {{the positions of the}} world's major medical organizations on non-therapeutic neonatal circumcision range from considering it as having a modest net health benefit that outweighs small risks to viewing it as having no benefit with significant risks for harm. No major medical organization recommends universal neonatal circumcision, and no major medical organization calls for banning it either. The Royal Dutch Medical Association, which expresses some of the strongest opposition to routine neonatal circumcision, does not call for the practice to be made illegal out of their concern that parents <b>who</b> <b>insist</b> on the procedure would turn to poorly trained practitioners instead of medical professionals. This argument to keep the procedure within the purview of medical professionals is found across all major medical organizations. In addition, the organizations advise medical professionals to yield to some degree to parental preferences, which are commonly based upon cultural or religious views, in their decision to agree to circumcise. The Danish College of General Practitioners states that circumcision should [...] "only [...] when medically needed, otherwise it is a case of mutilation." ...|$|E
500|$|The American film {{reviewer}} Leonard Maltin {{has suggested}} that {{if it had been}} Connery in the leading role instead of Lazenby, On Her Majesty's Secret Service would have epitomised the series. On the other hand, Danny Peary wrote, [...] "I'm not sure I agree with those <b>who</b> <b>insist</b> that if Connery had played Bond it would definitely be the best of the entire Bond series... Connery's Bond, with his boundless humor and sense of fun and self-confidence, would be out of place in this picture. It actually works better with Lazenby because he is incapable of playing Bond as a bigger-than-life hero; for one thing he hasn't the looks... Lazenby's Bond also hasn't the assurance of Connery's Bond and that is appropriate in the crumbling, depressing world he finds himself. He seems vulnerable and jittery at times. At the skating rink, he is actually scared. We worry about him... On Her Majesty's Secret Service doesn't have Connery and it's impossible to ever fully adjust to Lazenby, but I think that it still might be the best Bond film, as many Bond cultists claim." [...] Peary also described On Her Majesty's Secret Service as [...] "the most serious", [...] "the most cynical" [...] and [...] "the most tragic" [...] of the Bond films.|$|E

500|$|Like most Disney heroines, Meg sings {{about the}} {{experience}} of {{falling in love with}} the film's hero. Recognized as Meg's signature song, [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] has been identified as the character's [...] "big moment of romantic realization" [...] in Hercules. Prior to [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)", the audience has only been exposed to Meg's cynicism; the song finally reveals that Meg's cynicism is actually a reaction to her romantic side, uncovering the [...] "misunderstood nature" [...] of the character. [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] reveals that the Meg has fallen in love too fast before, and explains that she is afraid of repeating the same mistake once more with Hercules. Despite her best efforts, the character realizes that she has in fact begun to develop feelings for Hercules much to her chagrin, but at first refuses to admit this; the song allows Meg to [...] "work through her denial", by [...] "alternating between fantasizing about how delightful it would be to be loved by Herc, and stomping her foot in anger at the very thought." [...] Resembling an [...] "admonishing" [...] exchange between Meg and the Muses, [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] is Meg's attempt to avoid the clichéd storylines of her predecessors. Finally, after strolling a Greek courtyard while performing the song accompanied by the Muses <b>who</b> <b>insist</b> she is in denial, the character's resistance eventually proves futile and she ultimately relents. According to Taylor Weatherby of Billboard, the character [...] "finally comes to a conclusion to which many a girl (or guy) can relate". Tracy Dye of Bustle described the scene: [...] "Joined by The Muses, Meg attempts to vehemently deny her amour for Hercules". Writing for film critic Eric D. Snider's website, Kimber Kay joked that Meg [...] "tries her best to give a top 40 rendition of her solo song, but it gets stolen by the magnificent Muses." [...] Additionally, the musical number predicts that one of Hercules' most difficult challenges will be trying to change Meg's opinion of him. Writing for The Daily Dot, Aja Romano cited the song as Meg's [...] "I Want" [...] song.|$|E

2500|$|According to Wittgenstein, those <b>who</b> <b>insist</b> that {{consciousness}} (or {{any other}} apparently subjective mental state) is conceptually unconnected {{to the external}} world are mistaken.

Later Administrators agreed. [...] "Those <b>who</b> <b>insist</b> that marijuana has medical uses would serve society better by promoting or sponsoring more legitimate research," [...] former DEA Administrator Robert Bonner opined in 1992. This statement was quoted by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) in its membership drives.|$|E
2500|$|Duncan holds to a complementarian view {{of gender}} roles. [...] He {{believes}} that 1 Corinthians 14:34, which says 'women should keep {{silent in the}} churches', refers to women teaching men (like found in 1Timothy 2:12), This puts him {{at odds with the}} popular view espoused by Wayne Grudem and Don Carson <b>who</b> <b>insist</b> that the context shows that Paul is prohibiting women from publicly judging prophecy in the church. [...] In the church he serves, men teach mixed adult Sunday school classes, occasionally husband/wife teams teach on issues such as parenting and marriage.|$|E
2500|$|The Armistice also {{established}} regulations regarding {{prisoners of war}}.

On the opposite side, 327 South Korean soldiers, 21 American soldiers and 1 British soldier also refused repatriation, and remained in North Korea or in China.

In 2002, Bush searches for evidence that Saddam was creating nuclear weapons, and has the army prepared. All of Bush's White House staff supports him except Secretary of State Colin Powell, who states that planning to invade Iraq would destabilize the country. Powell is generally overruled by Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, <b>who</b> <b>insist</b> that the war would secure the United States' status as sole global superpower while spreading democracy throughout the Middle East.|$|E
2500|$|Cow is {{in general}} {{use as a}} {{singular}} for the collective cattle, despite the objections by those <b>who</b> <b>insist</b> {{it to be a}} female-specific term. Although the phrase [...] "that cow is a bull" [...] is absurd from a lexicographic standpoint, the word cow is easy to use when a singular is needed and the sex is unknown or irrelevant – when [...] "there is a cow in the road", for example. Further, any herd of fully mature cattle in or near a pasture is statistically likely to consist mostly of cows, so the term is probably accurate even in the restrictive sense. [...] Other than the few bulls needed for breeding, the vast majority of male cattle are castrated as calves and slaughtered for meat before the age of three years. [...] Thus, in a pastured herd, any calves or herd bulls usually are clearly distinguishable from the cows due to distinctively different sizes and clear anatomical differences. Merriam-Webster, a US dictionary, recognizes the sex-nonspecific use of cow as an alternate definition, whereas Collins and the OED, UK dictionaries, do not.|$|E
2500|$|This {{designation}} {{also leads}} to confusion with the other, more famous, 3rd Arkansas, commanded by Colonels Albert C. Rust and Van H. Manning. The Rust/Manning [...] "3rd Arkansas", {{was not a}} regiment that was ever officially authorized by the Arkansas State Military Board. [...] By the time that a several volunteer companies in South Arkansas had recruited and organized, the State had already reached its original goal of eight regiments, so the services of these new companies were declined on the thought that war would not last long. [...] These companies {{decided to go to}} Virginia and volunteer their services there. [...] This group of regiments moved to Lynchburg, Virginia and organized themselves into a regiment, and elected Albert Rust as their colonel. They were mustered into service by the Confederate War Department as the 3rd Regiment Arkansas Volunteers. [...] There are those to this very day <b>who</b> <b>insist</b> that Rust's 3rd Arkansas was the same unit that fought at Wilson's Creek, despite unimpeachable documentation showing that Rust's unit was camped on the Greenbrier River in Virginia {{at the time of the}} battle.|$|E
