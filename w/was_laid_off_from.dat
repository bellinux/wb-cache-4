Wikipedia was initially launched by Bomis to provide content for Nupedia, and was a for-profit venture (a Bomis subsidiary) through the end of 2002. As the costs of Wikipedia rose with its popularity, Bomis' revenues declined as result of the dot-com crash. Since Wikipedia was a drain on Bomis' resources, Wales and philosophy graduate student Larry Sanger decided to fund the project as a charity; Sanger <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> <b>from</b> Bomis in 2002. Nupedia content was merged into Wikipedia, and it ceased in 2003.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, Hecker took a {{job with}} Maxis where he worked with Will Wright on what became the 2008 game Spore. He led the {{development}} {{of many of the}} key technologies on Spore, including the core creature tessellation, painting, skinning, and animation technologies. Hecker's research and development effort on Spore is widely regarded as a major step forward in procedural character animation and rendering. Part of the technology he developed while working on the project was later selected for publication in the SIGGRAPH 2008 Transactions on Graphics conference proceedings, and became a featured presentation at that conference. Wright later claimed in an interview that Hecker's work on Spore had advanced {{the state of the art}} in procedural animation by several years. Following Spores release in late 2008, some players believed that comments Hecker had made in Seed Magazine indicated that he had been primarily responsible for the game's lack of hard scientific backing. This interpretation of the interview was discredited by Wright. and Spore producer Lucy Bradshaw. Hecker <b>was</b> <b>laid</b> <b>off</b> <b>from</b> Maxis in late 2009, and is currently working on the [...] "indie" [...] game SpyParty.
