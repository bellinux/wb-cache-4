5|$|In formal competition, {{each player}} {{is obliged to}} record each move as it is played in a chess {{notation}} in order to settle disputes about illegal positions, overstepping time control, and making claims of draws by the fifty-move rule or repetition of position. Algebraic chess notation is the accepted standard for recording games today. There are other systems such as ICCF numeric notation for international correspondence chess and the obsolete descriptive chess notation. The current rule is that a move must {{be made on the}} board before it is written on paper or recorded <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>electronic</b> device.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} round, a Japanese player (Tang Tang) was {{forfeited}} {{after he was}} caught <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>electronic</b> device in a random check conducted prior to leaving the venue. The game result was reversed from a win for the player to a loss, which also resulted in {{a change in the}} match score. Chief Arbiter Faiq Hasanov said that he was approached by an arbiter in the anti-cheating department and informed about the matter. He himself did not bother to check if there was a chess program installed on the device, as possession already violated the rules, leading to an automatic forfeiture. Later information from other arbiters involved indicated there possibly were two devices involved, and their quick check did not indicate a chess program was running. Without sufficient evidence of cheating per se, Hasanov felt that more than game disqualification would be double punishment. The captain of the Japanese team GM Mihajlo Stojanović later addressed some of the related issues in comments on the blog of the Macedonian grandmaster and general secretary of the Association of Chess Professionals Aleksandar Čolooviḱ.|$|E

25|$|Radar jamming {{refers to}} radio {{frequency}} signals originating from sources outside the radar, transmitting in the radar's frequency and thereby masking targets of interest.

Jamming is considered an active interference source, since it is initiated by elements outside the radar and in general unrelated to the radar signals.|$|E
