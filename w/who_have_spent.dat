25|$|In Japan 2 {{business}} schools offer the accredited MBA degree (AACSB, AMBA or EQUIS). The {{concept of an}} MBA is still not considered mainstream as traditional companies still perceive that knowledge and learning with respect to business and management can only be effectively gained through experience and not within a classroom. In fact, some companies {{have been known to}} place recent MBA recipients in unrelated fields, or try to re-acclimate their Japanese employees <b>who</b> <b>have</b> <b>spent</b> years overseas earning the degree. As a consequence, academic institutions in Japan are attempting to reinvent the perception of the MBA degree, by taking into account the local corporate culture.|$|E

25|$|In {{regards to}} San Francisco, some {{interesting}} negative externalities are being experienced {{due to the}} dredging of land by the Bay.

If this lawsuit results in success for San Francisco this could lead to policy changes being made in the future surrounding transparency between developers and potential buyers of the developed land.|$|E
