5000|$|The {{fourth group}} are the <b>white</b> blister <b>rusts,</b> Albuginales, which cause white blister disease {{on a variety}} of {{flowering}} plants. <b>White</b> blister <b>rusts</b> sporulate beneath the epidermis of their hosts, causing spore-filled blisters on stems, leaves and the inflorescence. The Albuginales are currently divided into three genera, Albugo parasitic predominantly to Brassicales, Pustula, parasitic predominantly to Asterales, and Wilsoniana, predominantly parasitic to Caryophyllales. Like the downy mildews, the <b>white</b> blister <b>rusts</b> are obligate biotrophs, which means that they are unable to survive without the presence of a living host.|$|R

50|$|<b>White</b> <b>rust</b> can be {{a devastating}} disease on many {{important}} agricultural crops throughout the world. Seventeen races of <b>white</b> <b>rust</b> have been identified worldwide, each {{with a high level}} of host specificity. <b>White</b> <b>rust</b> is an economically important foliar disease, causing substantial yield losses and eventual death of various crops.

Symptoms of <b>white</b> <b>rust</b> caused by Albugo typically include yellow lesions on the upper leaf surface and white pustules on the underside of the leaf. The pathogen is spread by wind, water, and insects. Management includes use of resistant cultivars, proper irrigation practices, crop rotation, sanitation, and chemical control. <b>White</b> <b>rust</b> is an important economic disease, causing severe crop losses if not controlled.|$|E

40|$|Biotrophic {{eukaryotic}} plant pathogens {{require a}} living host for their growth and form an intimate haustorial interface with parasitized cells. Evolution to biotrophy occurred independently in fungal rusts and powdery mildews, and in oomycete <b>white</b> <b>rusts</b> and downy mildews. Biotroph evolution and molecular mechanisms of biotrophy are poorly understood. It has been proposed, but not shown, that obligate biotrophy results from (i) reduced selection for maintenance of biosynthetic pathways and (ii) gain of mechanisms to evade host recognition or suppress host defence. Here we use Illumina sequencing {{to define the}} genome, transcriptome, and gene models for the obligate biotroph oomycete and Arabidopsis parasite, Albugo laibachii. A. laibachii {{is a member of}} the Chromalveolata, which incorporates Heterokonts (containing the oomycetes), Apicomplexa (which includes human parasites like Plasmodium falciparum and Toxoplasma gondii), and four other taxa.

Biotrophy also requires "effectors" to suppress host defence; we reveal RXLR and Crinkler effectors shared with other oomycetes, and also discover and verify a novel class of effectors, the "CHXCs", by showing effector delivery and effector functionality. Our findings suggest that evolution to progressively more intimate association between host and parasite results in reduced selection for retention of certain biosynthetic pathways, and particularly reduced selection for retention of molybdopterin-requiring biosynthetic pathways.
