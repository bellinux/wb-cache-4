40|$|Abstract- The {{notion of}} <b>soft</b> topological spaces <b>with</b> <b>soft</b> ideal was studied by Kandil et al. [15]. Applications to various fields were further {{investigated}} by Kandil et al. [13, 14]. The notion of connectedness in soft topological spaces was initiated by Lin in [19]. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to introduce and study the notion of connectedness to <b>soft</b> topological spaces <b>with</b> <b>soft</b> ideals. We study the notions of?-soft connected sets,?-soft separated sets and?s-soft connected sets in <b>soft</b> topological spaces <b>with</b> <b>soft</b> ideals...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{visual performance}} during con-centrated visual work in patients wearing soft contact lenses or after LASIK. METHODS: Thirty-one eyes of 17 {{patients who had}} worn soft contact lenses before LASIK were examined by the following tests immediately and 10 seconds after eye opening: 1) functional visual acuity, which is defi ned as visual acuity measured after prolonged eye opening without blinking; 2) surface regularity index (SRI) and surface asymmetry index (SAI) in corneal topography; and 3) higher order aberration measured with NIDEK OPD-Scan. Results were compared in the same patients before (<b>with</b> <b>soft</b> contact lenses and no eye surgery) and 1 month after LASIK (without soft contact lenses). RESULTS: Functional visual acuity was signifi cantly de-creased 10 seconds after eye opening compared with immediately after eye opening, both <b>with</b> <b>soft</b> contact lenses and after LASIK, and decreased {{to a greater extent}} <b>with</b> <b>soft</b> contact lenses. The SRI and SAI were signifi cantly increased 10 seconds after eye opening compared with immediately after eye opening, both <b>with</b> <b>soft</b> contact lenses and after LASIK, and increased to a greater extent <b>with</b> <b>soft</b> contact lenses. Higher order aberration was increased 10 seconds after eye opening <b>with</b> <b>soft</b> contact lenses, but not after LASIK. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that prolonged eye opening induces a decreased quality of vision in eyes of soft contact lens wearers and after LASIK. Under condi-tions in which blinking is restricted due to concentrated visual work, such as visual display terminal work, read-ing, and driving, visual performance may be more com-promised <b>with</b> <b>soft</b> contact lens wear than after LASIK...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio to differentiate soft tissue sarcoma from benign soft tissue tumours. METHODS: A retrospective study of pretreatment haematology and biochemistry in dogs diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>soft</b> tissue sarcoma or benign soft tissue tumours. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to- globulin ratio were compared between the two groups. In dogs diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>soft</b> tissue sarcoma, the relationship of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to-globulin ratio to histological tumour grade (I to III) was assessed. RESULTS: In the dogs <b>with</b> <b>soft</b> tissue sarcoma (n= 22), the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio was significantly increased and the albumin-to-globulin ratio decreased compared to those <b>with</b> benign <b>soft</b> tissue tumours (n= 14). The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to globulin ratio were not useful as predictors of tumour grade in dogs diagnosed <b>with</b> <b>soft</b> tissue sarcoma. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Pretreatment neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and albumin-to globulin ratio may aid with diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. Further investigation into their prognostic implications is warranted...|$|R
