On 22 October 2014, Halep stunned two-time defending champion Serena Williams. Williams's two games won equaled her career worst; {{the last time}} Williams managed to win just two games in a WTA Tour or Grand Slam match was in 1998 <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> 16 years old. Halep could have eliminated Williams from the tournament had she lost her final round-robin match to Ana Ivanovic in straight sets; however, Halep chose to play to win the match and ended up losing in three sets. Despite the defeat, Halep won her group and secured an appearance in the semifinals. She advanced to the final by beating Agnieszka Radwańska in straight sets. In the final match, she once again faced Williams, but this time lost in straight sets.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{achievements}} of the Duke's premiership was {{the arrangement of the}} King's marriage. The King had been betrothed to Mariana Victoria, the infanta of Spain, daughter of the Spanish king, in 1721, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> three years old, and the French king only eleven. By 1724, the king was fourteen but the infanta was still a decade away from child-bearing age. Some felt that this was too long for France to wait for an heir. This was especially so because, if Louis XV died without an heir, it was feared that, armed with a hereditary right he had renounced when he became king of Spain, Philip V de Bourbon would ignore the Treaty of Utrecht and claim the French throne, thus plunging France and Spain into conflict with the other European powers.|$|E
25|$|Her father, {{as well as}} his {{elder brother}} Timothy, and, still more, a son of the latter, had been {{accustomed}} to write in measured rhyme, their poems sometimes appearing in the local papers; and perhaps it was not strange that Harriett should, as soon as she could hold a pen, make crude attempts in the same direction. She was furnished with a copy book in which she wrote slowly and laboriously; and she soon turned surreptitiously {{to the back of the}} book and werote loose rhymes that were jingling in her brain. On one occasion, the teacher passed by her desk <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> finishing a rhymed account of some event which had occurred in the school room. Something must have attracted the teacher's attention; for he noticed her book, grabbed it, and, after running it through by himself, with a laugh, he proceeded to read it aloud to the school. When class was over, she scurried home. Thought her father soothed her ruffled mood, her copy-book confidences were discontinued.|$|E

In a song titled [...] "Sunflowers for Alfred Roy", present on Charmbracelet, Carey refers to a moment she shared with him on his death-bed.

She is killed in a car crash in Series 5. Helen Baxendale became pregnant during Series 4, which meant the plot of Rachel being infertile had to be abandoned {{and the rest of the}} series re-written. Baxendale found the character limiting and hard to play <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> [...] "the woman that Adam saw through rose-tinted glasses".
