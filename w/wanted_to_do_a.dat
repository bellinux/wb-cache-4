During the shoot, {{the video}} was documented by MTV; in the interview, Allen declared: I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> dance routine, even though I'm not really doing a dance routine, {{other people are}} doing it, but I'm part of it. I think people are quite used to girls in this industry really being able to move {{in front of the}} camera, but I'm just rubbish at that kind of thing.|$|E

But I asked her to sing it all, and she just made up the whole melody on the spot, and sang this amazing solo. At that moment I realised that this girl has a really special gift.|$|E
5|$|Kim Deal's {{band the}} Breeders {{released}} Last Splash in August 1993; {{the album was}} very successful, and its release was followed by much touring. The Breeders then took an extended break from activity. One reason was that Deal's sister Kelley, who {{was also in the}} group, was arrested on drug charges in November 1994. Member Josephine Wiggs likewise took time away from the band, although Wiggs and Deal have different memories of the circumstances surrounding this. Wiggs recalls offering to be involved if Deal's next album {{was going to be a}} Breeders record, but having the impression that Deal <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> solo release; Deal remembers Wiggs declining to be part of any immediate Breeders' recording, but offering to be on the one after that.|$|E

5|$|Shout-out to Mariah Carey and {{her whole}} squad and my boy Chris Lighty. He got me and Mariah together. I {{appreciate}} it. He {{put me on}} there as well as her. Both of them are smart for doing that. The song came out hard. Mariah knew I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> song with her. It finally happened, {{and it turned out}} hard. I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get in the studio with them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E
5|$|In January 2016, Wintory {{started a}} Kickstarter for a Journey Live concert tour, {{in which the}} fifteen-piece Fifth House Ensemble from Chicago will perform the music from the game while a player works {{their way through the}} game. The {{ensemble}} will react to the player's actions, using a specially-scored version of the soundtrack, composed by Patrick O'Malley with Wintory's oversight, that breaks the music into small pieces to enable this reaction. Wintory had <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> performance of the Journey soundtrack in this interactive manner, but did not have the time to rework the soundtrack for this purpose. Wintory came to know Dan Visconti, the composer for Fifth House Ensemble, after Visconti published his praise for the Journey soundtrack and had encouraged other members of the ensemble to play the game. The group saw how Journeys soundtrack had been used for various Video Games Live concerts and believed they could pull off Wintory's vision of an interactive concert, doing most of the reworking of the soundtrack under Wintory's direction. Sony has provided Wintory with a version of the game developed by Tricky Pixels that disables the music to allow the ensemble to provide this, and other modifications required for the concert performance. The Kickstarter was launched for $9,000 in funding for a four-city tour, but within a few days already surpassed its funding levels, allowing for more cities to be included.|$|E

25|$|In March 1980, Paramount was {{planning}} a weekly NBC-TV series as a starring vehicle for Welles; Leon Tokatyan (Lou Grant) {{was to write}} the pilot. Welles again declined because he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> series of 90-minute specials, perhaps two or three a year, instead of a weekly series. William Conrad was cast as Wolfe in the 1981 TV series.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea of the}} {{documentary}} was first thought of by Kemp around January 2005, after the series on Gangs {{when he came up}} with the idea of embedding himself with a unit. Kemp had initially <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> series about troops in Iraq following the 2003 invasion and posed the idea to James Murdoch, head of Sky TV. Due to the prevailing sensitive political situation, the MOD were reluctant.|$|E

At first {{he tried to}} get Mandela's {{autobiography}} Long Walk to Freedom adapted into a finished script, but it was not finalized. In 2007, he purchased the film rights to a book by John Carlin, Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made a Nation. Clint Eastwood directed the Nelson Mandela bio-pic titled Invictus, starring Freeman as Mandela and Matt Damon as rugby team captain Francois Pienaar.|$|E

25|$|In Allen's opinion, {{the problem}} with Funny Lady was that Barbra Streisand had not <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> sequel to Funny Girl and was {{determined}} to give the director, Herbert Ross, a hard time. Ray Stark had her cross-collateralized on three films and she was, figuratively speaking, escorted to the set every day {{by a team of}} lawyers. The picture does, however, contain some of Allen's most satisfying work, some of which she doesn't remember writing and just seems to have come out of nowhere.|$|E
25|$|On 25 March, After School {{released}} {{their third}} single album Bang! with new member Lizzy where the group {{took on a}} marching band concept. Kahi revealed that she was inspired after watching the American film Drumline, and had always <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> marching band concept ever since she took to the stage as an After School member. The group practiced playing the drums for five months with a trainer for the single. The title track entered the Gaon Weekly Chart at number 2 and reached number 29 on the 2010 Gaon year-end digital chart with 2,374,731 digital downloads sold.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, Hammer shot {{a half-hour}} pilot episode for a TV series {{to be called}} Tales of Frankenstein, in {{association}} with Columbia Pictures. Anton Diffring played the Baron, and Don Megowan his creation. Curt Siodmak directed. The series was scrapped, {{largely because of the}} two companies's disagreement over what the basic thrust of the series would be. Hammer <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> series about Baron Frankenstein involved in various misadventures, while Columbia wanted a series of science fiction stories loosely based around the idea of science gone wrong. Though unshown {{at the time of its}} production, the episode is available on DVD from several sources.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} a few {{exceptions}} to this policy since 2006; in 2008, the Montreal Canadiens became the first Canadian team featured on the NHL on NBC during the regular season (NBC Sports' Dick Ebersol was rumored to have specifically <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> game from Montreal at some point). The Canadiens played the New York Rangers on February 3. The 2014 NHL Winter Classic also featured a Canadian team, the Toronto Maple Leafs, up against the Detroit Red Wings at Michigan Stadium. Due to the revamp of the league's conferences and divisions that season, the cross-border rivalry had become an interdivisional one with the Wings' move to the Eastern Conference. The 2016 NHL Winter Classic will have the Montreal Canadiens facing the Boston Bruins in Foxboro, Massachusetts. The Boston/Montreal rivalry is generally considered the fiercest in the NHL; in fact, there were rumblings that if Montreal were not Boston's opponent in the 2016 Classic that Boston would relinquish the game.|$|E

500|$|Discussing the film's origins, Henson {{explained}} that he and Froud [...] "wanted to do a lighter weight picture, with more {{of a sense of}} comedy since Dark Crystal got kind of heavy – heavier than we had intended.

500|$|The film is loosely {{inspired}} {{by the work of}} Raymond Chandler. Joel Coen stated: [...] "We <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> Chandler kind of story – how it moves episodically, and deals with the characters trying to unravel a mystery, as well as having a hopelessly complex plot that's ultimately unimportant."
