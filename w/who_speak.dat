5|$|As decolonisation {{proceeded}} {{throughout the}} British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather {{continued to use}} it as independent countries setting their own language policies. For example, the view of the English language among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India. English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK. However English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India. David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people <b>who</b> <b>speak</b> or understand English than {{any other country in the}} world, but the number of English speakers in India is very uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'u'lláh {{stated that}} he was a {{messenger}} of God, and he used the term Manifestation of God to define the concept of an intermediary between humanity and God. In the Bahá'í writings, the Manifestations of God are a series of interrelated personages <b>who</b> <b>speak</b> with a divine voice and who reflect the attributes of the divine into the human world for the progress and advancement of human morals and civilization. The Manifestations of God, as explained by Bahá'u'lláh, are not incarnations of God, but have a two-fold station; one which is the divine in that they reveal God's attributes, but not God's essence, and one which is human in that they represent the physical qualities of common man, and have human limitations. Bahá'u'lláh wrote that God will never manifest his essence into the world.|$|E
5|$|Countries {{with large}} {{communities}} of native speakers of English (the inner circle) include Britain, the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand, {{where the majority}} speaks English, and South Africa, where a significant minority speaks English.

In these countries, children of native speakers learn English from their parents, and local people <b>who</b> <b>speak</b> other languages or new immigrants learn English to communicate in their neighbourhoods and workplaces.

5|$|Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is an MMORPG and {{features}} a persistent {{world in which}} players can {{interact with each other}} and the environment. Players create and customize their characters for use in the game, including name, race, gender, facial features, and starting class. Unlike in the original release, players may only choose to be a Disciple of War or Magic as a starting class—Disciples of the Hand and Land are initially unavailable. Players must also select a game world for characters to exist on. While servers are not explicitly delineated by language, data centers have been placed in the supported regions (i.e., North America, Europe, Japan) to improve the communication latency between the server and the client computer and players are recommended to choose a server in their region. Regardless of server or language, the game features a large library of automatically translated game terms and general phrases which allow players <b>who</b> <b>speak</b> different languages to communicate.|$|E

5|$|In Gampaha District, Tamils have {{historically}} inhabited the coastal region. In the Puttalam District, {{there was a}} substantial ethnic Tamil population until the first two decades of the 20th century. Most of those who identify as ethnic Tamils live in villages such as Udappu and Maradankulam. There are also Tamil Christians, chiefly Roman Catholics, who have preserved their heritage in the major cities such as Negombo, Chilaw, Puttalam, and also in villages such as Mampuri. Some residents of these two districts, especially the traditional fishermen, are bilingual, ensuring that the Tamil language survives as a lingua franca among migrating fishing communities across the island. Negombo Tamil dialect is spoken by about 50,000 people. This number does not include others, outside of Negombo city, <b>who</b> <b>speak</b> local varieties of the Tamil language.|$|E
5|$|While {{humans have}} the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an {{environment}} in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on communities of speakers in which children learn language from their elders and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those <b>who</b> <b>speak</b> them to communicate and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes. Due {{to the way in which}} language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to language contact. The process is similar to the process of evolution, where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a phylogenetic tree.|$|E
5|$|Roman Catholics {{from the}} South Canara {{district}} on the south-western coast of India, {{under the jurisdiction}} of the Mangalore Diocese, are generally known as Mangalorean Catholics. They are Konkani people <b>who</b> <b>speak</b> the Konkani language. All earlier records of South Canara's Christians were lost at the time of their deportation by Tipu in 1784 and it is not known when Christianity was introduced in South Canara. It is possible that Syrian Christians settled in South Canara as they had in Malabar, a region south of Canara. During the 13thcentury Italian traveller Marco Polo recorded that there were considerable trading activities between the Red Sea and the Canara coast. Scholars have surmised that foreign Christian merchants were visiting the coastal towns of South Canara during that period for commerce, and that some Christian priests possibly accompanied them in their evangelical work. In 1321, the French Dominican friar Jordanus Catalani of Severac in south-western France, arrived in Bhatkal, North Canara. According to historian Severine Silva, no concrete evidence has yet been found that there were any permanent settlements of Christians in South Canara before the 16thcentury.|$|E
