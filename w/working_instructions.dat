5000|$|In 1829, Daguerre {{partnered with}} Nicéphore Niépce, an {{inventor}} who had produced the world's first heliograph in 1822 {{and the oldest}} surviving camera photograph in 1826 or 1827. Niépce died suddenly in 1833, but Daguerre continued experimenting, and evolved the process which would subsequently {{be known as the}} daguerreotype. After efforts to interest private investors proved fruitless, Daguerre went public with his invention in 1839. At a joint meeting of the French Academy of Sciences and the Académie des Beaux Arts on 7 January of that year, the invention was announced and described in general terms, but all specific details were withheld. Under assurances of strict confidentiality, Daguerre explained and demonstrated the process only to the Academy's perpetual secretary François Arago, who proved to be an invaluable advocate. Members of the Academy and other select individuals were allowed to examine specimens at Daguerre's studio. The images were enthusiastically praised as nearly miraculous, and news of the daguerreotype quickly spread. Arrangements were made for Daguerre's rights to be acquired by the French Government in exchange for lifetime pensions for himself and Niépce's son Isidore; then, on 19 August 1839, the French Government presented the invention as a gift from France [...] "free to the world", and complete <b>working</b> <b>instructions</b> were published. In 1839, {{he was elected to the}} National Academy of Design as an Honorary Academician.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to {{investigate}} the need of <b>working</b> <b>instructions</b> in Derome Träteknik ́s industrial house-building factories. Furthermore we wanted to determine an appropriate way for developing <b>working</b> <b>instructions</b> adapted to the conditions in a certain production environment. In the construction industry today prefabricated building elements are frequently used. With this come repetitive work tasks that need to be carefully planned. In the planning process industry regulations, laws, requirements from suppliers and preferences from different actors in the certain company have to be included. Only then the positive effects of industrial building will be fully achieved. In our thesis we took these aspects into account by systematic observations, meetings with the company management and by a dialog with the suppliers. We also followed three working processes in detail and developed <b>working</b> <b>instructions</b> for one of them. The outcome of the report was that the most imported steps towards developing <b>working</b> <b>instructions</b> were identified. These were organized chronologically in a list...|$|E

Prior architectural characterization {{research has focused}} primarily on transaction processing, decision support, web serving and application serving workloads, and has identified three common workload characteristics: large <b>instruction</b> <b>working</b> sets, high cache miss rates, and a large fraction of dirty misses in multiprocessor systems. This paper studies an additional class of commercial workload—email serving—that is widely deployed yet poorly understood. In addition to studying the standard SPECmail 2001 POP 3 -based workload, we define and characterize a new IMAP-based transactional workload that models interactive e-mail users in various configurations under two diverse transaction mixes. On an 18 processor IBM S 80 shared-memory multiprocessor, we find that these workloads, though extremely CPU intensive, differ dramatically from other commercial workloads due to their smaller <b>instruction</b> <b>working</b> sets, reduced cache miss rates, and less frequent dirty misses in multiprocessor systems...|$|R

40|$|Instruction cache {{performance}} {{is important to}} instruction fetch eciency and overall processor performance. The layout of an executable has a substantial eect on the cache miss rate and the <b>instruction</b> <b>working</b> set size during execution. This means that the performance of an executable can be improved by applying a code-placement algorithm that minimizes instruction cache conflicts and improves spatial locality. We describe an algorithm for procedure placement, one type of code placement, that signicantly diers from previous approaches {{in the type of}} information used to drive the placement algorithm. In particular, we gather temporal-ordering information that summarizes the interleaving of procedures in a program trace. Our algorithm uses this information along with cache conguration and procedure size information to better estimate the conflict cost of a potential procedure ordering. It optimizes the procedure placement for single level and multilevel caches. In addition to reducing instruction cache conflicts, the algorithm simultaneously minimizes the <b>instruction</b> <b>working</b> set size of the program. We compare the performance of our algorithm with a particularly successful procedure-placement algorithm and show noticeable improvement...|$|R

40|$|Detecting program phase changes {{accurately}} is {{an important}} aspect of dynamically adaptable systems. Three dynamic program phase detection techniques are compared – using <b>instruction</b> <b>working</b> sets, basic block vectors (BBV), and conditional branch counts. Because program phases are difficult to define, we compare the techniques using a variety of metrics. BBV techniques perform better than the other techniques providing higher sensitivity and more stable phases. However, the <b>instruction</b> <b>working</b> set technique yields 30 % longer phases than the BBV method, although there is less stability within phases. On average, the methods agree on phase changes 85 % of the time. Of the 15 % of time they disagree, the BBV method is more efficient at detecting performance changes. The conditional branch counter technique provides good sensitivity, but is less effective at detecting major phase changes. Nevertheless, the branch counter technique correlates 83 % of the time with the BBV based technique. As an auxiliary result, we show that techniques based on procedure granularities do not perform as well as those based on instruction or basic block granularities. This is mainly due to their inability to detect changes within procedures. 1...|$|R
