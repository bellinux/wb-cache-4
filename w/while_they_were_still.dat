5|$|During the pre-dawn {{coup and}} {{throughout}} the day, there was little reaction by the public who went about their daily life as though nothing had happened. Many appeared unaware that a coup had occurred <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> sleeping. There was no disruption to road traffic or the media, and although flights were halted in the morning, they resumed in the afternoon. There were plans to enact a curfew but this was abandoned.|$|E
5|$|Original members Adam Levine, Jesse Carmichael, Mickey Madden {{and drummer}} Ryan Dusick first came {{together}} as Kara's Flowers in 1994, <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> in high school. The band self-released an album called We Like Digging?, then signed to Reprise Records and released the album The Fourth World in 1997. After the album garnered a tepid response, the band parted ways with the record label {{and the members}} attended college.|$|E
5|$|Phase 2: Vahan, {{noticing the}} huge cavalry {{maneuver}} of the Muslims, ordered his cavalry to group together, {{but was not}} quick enough; before Vahan could organize his disparate heavy cavalry squadrons, Khalid had wheeled his cavalry back to attack the concentrating Byzantine cavalry squadrons, falling upon them from the front and the flank <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> moving into formation. The disorganized and disoriented Byzantine heavy cavalry was soon routed and dispersed to the north, leaving the infantry to its fate.|$|E

In addition to three British Royal Charters issued for East Jersey, West Jersey and united New Jersey <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> colonies, the state has been governed by three constitutions. The first was issued on July 2, 1776, shortly before New Jersey ratified the United States Declaration of Independence and the second was issued in 1844. The current document was issued in 1947 and has been amended several times.|$|E
5|$|The Kalamazoo-class {{monitors}} were a {{class of}} ocean-going ironclad monitors begun during the American Civil War. Unfinished {{by the end of}} the war, their construction was suspended in November 1865 and the unseasoned wood of their hulls rotted <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> on the building stocks. If the four ships had been finished they would have been the most seaworthy monitors in the US Navy. One was scrapped in 1874 while the other three were disposed of a decade later.|$|E
5|$|Alexios {{advanced}} from Salonica {{and pitched}} {{camp on the}} river Charzanes near Dyrrhachium on October 15. He held a war council there and sought advice from his senior officers; among them was George Palaiologos, who had managed to sneak out of the city. A majority of the senior officers, including Palaiologos, urged caution, noting that time was with the Emperor. Alexios, however, favoured an immediate assault, hoping to catch Guiscard's army from the rear, <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> besieging the city. Alexios moved his army to the hills opposite the city, planning to attack the Normans the next day.|$|E

5|$|In 1960, <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> dating, Achebe {{dedicated}} to Christie Okoli his second novel, No Longer at Ease, about a civil servant who is embroiled in {{the corruption of}} Lagos. The protagonist is Obi, grandson of Things Fall Aparts main character, Okonkwo. Drawing on {{his time in the}} city, Achebe writes about Obi's experiences in Lagos to reflect the challenges facing a new generation on the threshold of Nigerian independence. Obi is trapped between the expectations of his family, its clan, his home village, and larger society. He is crushed by these forces (like his grandfather before him) and finds himself imprisoned for bribery. Having shown his acumen for portraying traditional Igbo culture, Achebe demonstrated in his second novel an ability to depict modern Nigerian life.|$|E
5|$|It is {{no longer}} {{possible}} for active parliamentarians to sit on the committee, except for the last half year of parliamentary representation, if they have stated that they will not run for re-election. This allowed Jagland and Valle to sit on the committee in 2009, <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> elected. The appointment is made by parliament after nominations by the parties who are to be represented in the committee. In 2009, the Labour Party had two seats, while the three next-largest parties, the Progress Party, the Conservative Party and the Socialist Left Party, each have one representative. The remaining parties in parliament are not represented.|$|E

5|$|Thompson has a keen {{interest}} in music and has played the guitar for several years. He often takes the instrument to work with him, as a means of occupying himself during takes.

The Rusholme Ruffians have performed at venues throughout the UK and the band's set list includes their own material, as well as songs by home-town influences such as Morrissey, The Smiths, Oasis, James and The Stone Roses. Thompson has expressed an interest in getting into the music industry later in life.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{fighting}} {{had not yet}} spread to the Pacific, by late 1940 there were growing concerns amongst the Allies {{about the possibility of}} a war with Japan. After a review of the defences around Singapore and Malaya, the British government requested Australian troops be sent to garrison the region. In October, the Australian government committed the 22nd Brigade and supporting elements. As a result, the 2/18th—with a strength of 793 men—subsequently embarked upon the RMS Queen Mary and left Sydney on 4 February 1941, bound for Singapore. The Australian government wished to send the brigade to the Middle East to join the 6th, 7th and 9th Divisions, so the deployment was only intended to be short, as the British government pledged to release an Indian division to replace the Australians in May. Consequently, the Australian forces were deployed having only been partially trained and equipped and <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> in the process of being brought up to full strength.|$|E

5|$|As part {{of their}} Wizard research, the Air Force had {{developed}} a formula that compared {{the cost of an}} ICBM to the ABM needed to shoot it down. The formula, later known as the cost-exchange ratio, could be expressed as a dollar figure; if the cost of the ICBM was less than that figure, the economic advantage was in favor of the offense - they could build more ICBMs for less money than the ABMs needed to shoot them down. A variety of scenarios demonstrated that it was almost always the case that the offense had the advantage. The Air Force ignored this inconvenient problem <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> working on Wizard, {{but as soon as the}} Army was handed sole control of the ABM efforts, they immediately submitted it to McElroy. McElroy identified this as an example of interservice fighting, but was concerned that the formula might be correct.|$|E
5|$|During the 1946 postseason, rumors {{began to}} swirl that Yankees owner Larry MacPhail was {{lobbying}} Brooklyn Dodgers manager Leo Durocher {{to leave the}} Dodgers and manage the Yankees. The move angered Dodgers owner Branch Rickey, who encouraged Chandler to begin {{an investigation into the}} gambling habits of Durocher and his associate, actor George Raft. In the offseason, Chandler and Durocher had a meeting wherein Chandler counseled Durocher to abandon his gambling. Branch Rickey charged Chandler with maintaining a double standard, however, when the commissioner took no action after seeing MacPhail with two known gamblers at a Yankees–Dodgers preseason exhibition in Havana, Cuba. MacPhail then signed two Dodgers assistant coaches—Chuck Dressen and John Corriden—as aides to Yankee manager Bucky Harris <b>while</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>still</b> employed by the Dodgers. Chandler suspended Dressen for 30 days and levied $2,000 fines against MacPhail and the Yankees.|$|E
