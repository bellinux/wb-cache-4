That meant that the connecting rods and coupling rods {{looked as if they}} were sliding across one another like a pair of scissors. The trailing axle and low-pitched firebox gave the engine good riding qualities.

40|$|ABSTRACT. This article {{reports on}} the {{implementation}} of published guidelines for retrofitting tractors with safe access platforms, which were developed {{to reduce the risk}} of serious injuries and deaths associated with mounting and dismounting. Farmer interviews and engineering−based inspections of ten retrofitted tractors were conducted to gather information regarding benefits and disadvantages of the retrofitting and to assess the construction of the platforms. A scoring system was developed for platform retrofitting, and weighted scores between zero and ten were calculated for tractor access before and after retrofitting. Access was improved on all tractors, although to varying degrees. The average post−retrofit weighted score was 6. 3 (range 2. 6 to 9. 7), compared with the pre−retrofit average of 0. 9 (range 0. 3 to 1. 6). Five tractors received a post−retrofit score of 8. 0 or higher. None of the lower−scoring tractors fully met the specifications for placement of the bottom step or rear <b>wheel</b> <b>guard,</b> two key characteristics for runover prevention. Other characteristics associated with a lower post−retrofit score included a low bottom step, high step rises, absence of colored nosing, and the front handrail space not being filled in. Platform retrofitting had little effect on tractor operations and substantially improved ease of access. This is the first published evaluation of a design−based solution for tractor runover injuries. This study shows that general guidelines for retrofitting of safe access platforms can be successfully applied. Mechanisms to increase adherence to the key criteria of bottom step positioning and rear <b>wheel</b> <b>guarding</b> should be included in future promotion...|$|R

The bridge is supported by a Burr arch truss, and is similar in design and construction to the one in Forksville. The western end of the Hillsgrove bridge lies against a steep hillside, and those approaching the bridge from the west must make a sharp right turn to enter it. Prior to the 2010 restoration, the sides were unpainted, but the portals were painted red, while the gable roof was sheet metal which had been installed over the original wooden shake shingles.|$|E

5000|$|Bench grinder wheels {{sometimes}} need to {{be restored}} to roundness and given a fresh grinding face with newly exposed grains. New wheels have suitable balance when first made, but whether the balanced state will last after the wheel has been mounted, and (especially) {{after it has been}} in use for a while, is [...] "quite uncertain". It can seem counterintuitive that they could wear as unevenly as they sometimes do, but a slow spin of the resting wheel by hand confirms it by showing the gap between wheel and tool rest varying substantially as the wheel turns. Thus it is normal that wheels sometimes {{need to be}} dressed (neatly trimmed), which is achieved by any of several types of wheel dresser. When bench grinders vibrate excessively, it is usually because the wheels have worn out of round and are thus out of balance. Truing them by dressing usually resolves this problem. Although some consumers might imagine buying a bench grinder and then using it for many years without thinking about wheel dressing, the need for dressing is not so seldom as that. Correcting the imbalance not only reduces the annoyance of vibration (which rattles the <b>wheel</b> <b>guards</b> and shakes the workbench) but also is important to prevent premature failure of the spindle bearings, as heavy vibration beats them excessively.|$|E
