5|$|The {{big change}} is that Billy {{is not being}} the big 'I do this—I do that'. It's much better. The band {{arranged}} a lot of songs for this record, and the song writing process was organic. The circumstances of the last record {{and the way that}} <b>we</b> <b>worked</b> was really bad.|$|E
25|$|They {{were pretty}} good sea boats, {{although}} very wet, {{there was a}} saying that they submerged at the Heads and surfaced down at Gabo Island. <b>We</b> <b>worked</b> mainly four on, four off. Turn to, to ‘shoot away’, pick up and store the catch and clean up. <b>We</b> <b>worked</b> bloody long hours. I think there were six deckies, four firemen, one engineer, one wireless operator and the master and mate. The galley was right aft with the mess room beneath. You would get your feed, climb down the hatchway to the mess room below. We would get {{a bucket of water}} from the galley to take to the forecastle where we bunked. By the time we got forward we would have only half a bucket of hot water to wash in but after a couple of days you didn’t worry about washing. You were wet through most of the time so it didn’t matter.|$|E

25|$|This is a {{historic}} moment– for the Congress, and for the women of this country. It is a moment for which we have waited more than 200 years. Never losing faith, we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights. But women weren't just waiting; women were working. Never losing faith, <b>we</b> <b>worked</b> to redeem the promise of America, that all {{men and women are}} created equal.

The location was suggested by Godrich, who had used the studio to produce records by Travis and Beck and {{thought it would be}} a [...] "good change of scenery" [...] for Radiohead. Yorke said: [...] "We were like, 'Do we want to fly halfway around the world to do this?' But it was terrific, because <b>we</b> <b>worked</b> really hard. We did a track a day.

"So I {{head out}} there and he plays me the track and it sounds exactly like how {{you want it to}} sound: forward moving, interesting, light-hearted, heavy-hearted, fucking {{incredible}} sounding jam.

That whole first week I was there <b>we</b> <b>worked</b> on the 'Woods' song, which is called 'Lost in the World'.

[...] The idea was eventually rejected because of the notion that the two gaming systems would be identical. Miyamoto also stated, [...] " [...] if the DS had flopped, we might have taken the Wii back to the drawing board."

500|$|Released on July 20, 1981, {{the album}} was not commercially acclaimed, failing to spawn a single hit. Though Sire Records had merged with Warner Bros. Records, none of the singles from Pleasant Dreams [...] were {{released}} in the US. Sire had insisted that the album be produced by a celebrity producer, hiring Graham Gouldman to the job expecting this to help expand the band's fan-base. Joey relates: [...] "The record company told us the album would bomb if we didn't use Graham Gouldman, so <b>we</b> <b>worked</b> with Graham--and the album bombed anyway." [...] The album would only chart in the US and Sweden, peaking at fifty-eight on the Billboard 200 and thirty-five on the Sverigetopplistan chart—the singles released from the album failed to chart.|$|E
500|$|FuseFX {{also worked}} on Lola, Coulson's [...] "vintage 1962 Corvette" [...] which was {{described}} as [...] "a classic car and beautiful in its own right, but through digital effects, Fuse has added hovercraft capabilities. When Coulson needs it, the wheel's rotate into a horizontal position, exposing hidden jet engine ducts that create lifting thrust through the rims of the tires, which double as turbo-fan blades. <b>We</b> <b>worked</b> closely with production to help design the mechanism and {{the look of the}} hovercraft engines. It's Stark technology designed to be consistent with the period aspect of the car." [...] When the real Corvette is shown transitioning to its hover mode, volumetric dust, exhaust, and particle effects are added. Occasionally, FuseFX was required to use a fully digital model of the car, which matches the real vehicle precisely.|$|E

His tenure with the band only lasted five months, with his departure from the group announced on September 6. In a statement, the band commented: [...] "We wanted to thank Duff for helping us write songs for our new record.
