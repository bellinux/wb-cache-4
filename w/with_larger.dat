40|$|How do {{small firms}} manage their {{alliance}} strategies <b>with</b> <b>large</b> firms? This study compares the relative impacts of exploration and exploitation alliances <b>with</b> <b>large</b> firms on small firms' valuation. Integrating the literatures on the exploration/exploitation paradigm and alliance governance, {{we argue that}} exploitation alliances <b>with</b> <b>large</b> firms will on average generate higher values for small firms than exploration alliances <b>with</b> <b>large</b> firms due to a heightened risk of appropriation in exploration alliances. However, if small firms can manage their alliances <b>with</b> <b>large</b> firms via proper alliance governance, they will increase their valuations from exploration alliances <b>with</b> <b>large</b> firms. Analyses of the U. S. biopharmaceutical industry from 1984 to 2006 largely support our hypotheses...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we study two random {{procedures}} in cubic graphs <b>with</b> <b>large</b> girth. The first procedure finds a probability distribution on edge-cuts such that each edge is in a randomly chosen cut with probability at least 0. 88672. As corollaries, we derive lower bounds {{for the size}} of maximum cut in cubic graphs <b>with</b> <b>large</b> girth and in random cubic graphs, and also an upper bound for the fractional cut covering number in cubic graphs <b>with</b> <b>large</b> girth. The second procedure finds a probability distribution on independent sets such that each vertex is in an independent set with probability at least 0. 4352. This implies lower bounds for the size of maximum independent set in cubic graphs <b>with</b> <b>large</b> girth and in random cubic graphs, {{as well as an}} upper bound for the fractional chromatic number in cubic graphs <b>with</b> <b>large</b> girth...|$|R

5|$|From {{the launch}} of the {{original}} iPhone to the iPhone 4S, iPhones used 3.5-inch displays—which are smaller than screens used by flagship phones from competitors. The iPhone 5 and its immediate successors featured a display that was taller, but the same width as prior models, measuring at 4 inches diagonally. Following Apple's loss in smartphone market share to companies producing phones <b>with</b> <b>larger</b> displays, reports as early as January 2014 suggested that Apple was preparing to launch new iPhone models <b>with</b> <b>larger,</b> 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch displays. Reports prior to its unveiling also speculated that Apple might use a new iPhone model to introduce a mobile payments platform using near-field communications—a technology that has been incorporated into many Android phones, but has experienced a low adoption rate among users.|$|E

The typical style of these structures is a rectangular or trapezoidal stone and earth mound that encloses a chamber lined <b>with</b> <b>larger</b> stone slabs.

There are two good examples in Monamore Glen west of the village of Lamlash, and similar structures called the Giants' Graves above Whiting Bay. There are numerous standing stones dating from prehistoric times, including six stone circles on Machrie Moor (Gaelic: Am Machaire).|$|E

Author David Topliss attributes this to political necessity, as he believed the Minister of the Navy could not validate purchasing a seemingly less-powerful dreadnought than the Minas Geraes class: <b>with</b> <b>larger</b> guns ruled out, the only remaining choice was a larger number of guns.|$|E
5|$|DNA viruses : The genome {{replication}} of most DNA viruses {{takes place in}} the cell's nucleus. If the cell has the appropriate receptor on its surface, these viruses enter the cell sometimes by direct fusion with the cell membrane (e.g., herpesviruses) or – more usually – by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most DNA viruses are entirely dependent on the host cell's DNA and RNA synthesising machinery, and RNA processing machinery. However, viruses <b>with</b> <b>larger</b> genomes may encode much of this machinery themselves. In eukaryotes the viral genome must cross the cell's nuclear membrane to access this machinery, while in bacteria it need only enter the cell.|$|E
