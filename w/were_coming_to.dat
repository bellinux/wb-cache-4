5|$|By this point, the Noel Park {{development}} and the growing nearby community of Wood Green <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> dominate the area. In recognition of this, in 1902 Green Lanes railway station was renamed Noel Park & Wood Green. In 1911 a group of mid-Victorian houses on Wood Green High Road, immediately south of the railway station, were demolished by the Artizans Company {{to make way for}} the Cheapside shopping parade, built to serve residents of Noel Park and the growing community of Wood Green.|$|E
5|$|In addition, the {{hospitality}} sector received a major boost {{due to the}} games, as hotels and guest houses received large booking orders from people who <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> see the Games - media-persons, delegates, officials, visitors, sports-persons, etc. Tourism also benefited from the Games, and the State Tourism Department showed many foreign journalists key tourism spots in the city. Many famous places such as the Charminar and the Chowmahalla Palace saw record number of visitors.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} cope with the {{psychological}} trauma of prostitution and violence, Falle became dependent on cocaine. Within two years, she was spending $500 per night on cocaine. Her drug use resulted in delusions and caused her to become schizophrenic, and subsequently distrustful of those around her, fearing that people <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> take away her drugs.|$|E

5|$|Revie {{returned}} to the First Division when he joined Leeds United in November 1958 for a £14,000 fee. Manager Bill Lambton had hoped that Revie's creativity would help the Peacocks to turn their poor form around, and appointed him as captain. Leeds avoided relegation in 1958–59, but new manager Jack Taylor took Leeds down in the 1959–60 campaign with the division's worst defensive record. Revie recognised his playing days <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> an end and relinquished the captaincy to Freddie Goodwin.|$|E
5|$|Stoneman and Burbridge {{continued}} on toward Marion where they encountered Witcher and his men. Burbridge's front regiment easily pushed back Witcher's small regiment, who stopped {{just so they}} could fire a volley into the Union cavalry. They then continued to retreat toward Marion. Witcher sent a courier to inform Breckinridge that they <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> join them at Marion.|$|E
5|$|Upon their arrival, {{many were}} in disbelief that the Rockets could thrive in Houston. They <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> {{a city that}} did not have a {{suitable}} arena, and had not shown much interest in professional basketball. Houston was previously home to the Houston Mavericks of the American Basketball Association for only two seasons between 1967 and 1969, where the average attendance was only 200. The city's largest indoor arena was 34-year-old Sam Houston Coliseum, but the Rockets quickly ruled out playing there even on a temporary basis. As the team owners planned out on building a proper arena, the Rockets were forced to play most of their games at the University of Houston's Hofheinz Pavilion, while playing occasional games at the Astrodome and San Antonio's HemisFair Arena.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the union dispute, many club patrons no longer visited the night spot. Those who were {{performers}} were informed of the possibility of fines and suspensions by their respective unions for crossing the Stork Club picket line as the issue continued. Many of Billingsley's friendships, including those of Walter Winchell and J. Edgar Hoover, were over as {{a result of}} the union problems. He began firing staff without good cause. As the dispute dragged on, there was also no longer a live band in the dining room for music; members of the Musicians' Union had crossed the picket line to perform for some time. Previously, the club had no need for advertising; it was mentioned frequently in print and word of mouth without it. In 1963, the club offered a hamburger and French fries for $1.99 in a New York Times advertisement; when those in the know about the club saw it, they realized the Stork Club's days <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> an end. In the last few months of its operation, at times there were only three customers for the entire evening. On a good day in the mid-1940s, some 2,500 people visited the club.|$|E
5|$|By the 1920s Abd al-Rahman was a {{respected}} {{religious and political}} leader. In 1921 he held a meeting at his home where the attendees signed two documents that laid out the Mahdist objectives. These were for Sudan to be ruled by Britain rather than Egypt, and for Sudan to eventually achieve self-government. In the early 1920s, between 5,000 and 15,000 pilgrims <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> Aba Island each year to celebrate Ramadan. Many of them identified Abd al-Rahman with Isa, the prophet Jesus, and assumed that he would drive the Christian colonists out of Sudan. The British found that Abd al-Rahman was in correspondence with agents and leaders in Nigeria and Cameroon, predicting the eventual victory of the Mahdists over the Christians. They blamed him for unrest in these colonies. After pilgrims from West Africa held mass demonstrations on Aba Island in 1924, Abd al-Rahman was told {{to put a stop}} to the pilgrimages.|$|E
5|$|In early 1872, Macdonald {{submitted}} the treaty for ratification, and {{it passed the}} Commons with a majority of 66. The general election was held through late August and early September (future Canadian elections would be conducted, {{for the most part}}, on one day). Redistribution had given Ontario increased representation in the House; Macdonald spent much time campaigning in the province, for the most part outside Kingston. Widespread bribery of voters took place throughout Canada, a practice especially effective in the era when votes were publicly declared; in future elections the secret ballot would be used. Macdonald and the Conservatives saw their majority reduced from 35 to 8. The Liberals (as the Grits <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> be known) did better than the Conservatives in Ontario, forcing the government to rely on the votes of Western and Maritime MPs who did not fully support the party.|$|E

5|$|To {{recover from}} her {{experience}} at Studley, Fortune began studying psychotherapy. Her initial interest {{was in the}} work of Sigmund Freud and Alfred Adler, though she later moved on to that of Carl Jung. She studied psychology and psychoanalysis under John Flügel at the University of London, before gaining employment at a psychological clinic in London's Brunswick Square, which was likely run {{under the jurisdiction of the}} London School of Medicine for Women. Working as a counsellor from 1914 until 1916, most of those she dealt with <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> terms with sexual urges that were considered taboo in British society. Through her affiliation with the Society for the Study of Orthopsychics, she gave a series of lectures that were later published in 1922 as The Machinery of the Mind. While working at the clinic, she developed her interest in esotericism by attending lunchtime lectures organised by the Theosophical Society and reading some of the organisation's literature. With her interest in occultism increasing, Fortune became increasingly dissatisfied with the effectiveness of psychotherapy.|$|E
5|$|York again drew Liverpool in the FA Cup fifth {{round in}} 1985–86, {{and took the}} lead through Gary Ford only to concede a {{stoppage}} time equaliser. Tony Canham scored at Anfield and York had a second goal disallowed before York succymbed to a 3–1 defeat in extra time. York lost only three home league matches all season, but missed out on promotion after finishing seventh. In the summer of 1986 he sold MacPhail to Bristol City for £15,000, whilst many of the veteran players he signed {{when he first came}} to the club <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> the end of their careers. The 1986–87 season was disappointing for York as they were knocked out of the FA Cup by non-League team Caernarfon Town and ended the season in 20th-place. They did though manage to beat Chelsea 1–0 in the League Cup, but lost the return fixture at Stamford Bridge 3–0. Smith ended up falling out with the club's directors, who invested money in the club's facilities rather than on players, and released goalkeeper Andy Leaning against his wishes.|$|E
5|$|Andrée {{resisted}} Ekholm's criticisms to {{the point}} of deception. On the boat back from Svalbard, Ekholm learned from the chief engineer of the hydrogen plant the explanation of some anomalies he had noticed in his measurements: Andrée had from time to time secretly ordered extra topping-up of the hydrogen in the balloon. Andrée's motives for such self-destructive behavior are not known. Several modern writers, following Sundman's Andrée portrait in the semi-documentary novel, The Flight of the Eagle (1967), have speculated that Andrée had by this time become the prisoner of his own successful funding campaign. The sponsors and the media followed every delay and reported on every setback, and were clamoring for results. Andrée, Strindberg, and Ekholm had been seen off by cheering crowds in Stockholm and Gothenburg (see image from Aftonbladet, right), and now all the expectations <b>were</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> nothing with the long wait for southerly winds at Danes Island. Especially pointed was the contrast between Nansen's simultaneous return, covered in polar glory from his daring yet well-planned expedition on the ship Fram, and Andrée's failure even to launch his own much-hyped conveyance. Sundman theorizes that Andrée could not face letting the press report {{that he did not know}} the prevailing wind direction, and had also miscalculated in ordering the balloon, and needed a new one to rectify his error.|$|E
