25|$|The Birmingham Plateau {{during the}} medieval period was heavily wooded but poorly {{supplied}} with building stone, so {{the architecture of}} the early town was dominated by timber framing, with dark wooden structures in complex patterns infilled with lightly coloured plaster. As late as the 19th century guidebooks would compare Birmingham's surviving medieval streetscape with those of Shrewsbury or Chester. Distinctive local styles of <b>wall</b> <b>framing</b> emerged, including the use of close studding and decorative braces within panels in herringbone and quadrant patterns, exemplified by the early 16th century Golden Lion Inn, which survives in Cannon Hill Park.|$|E

40|$|Cold-formed steel <b>wall</b> <b>frame</b> {{systems are}} {{commonly}} made of lipped or unlipped (plain) C-section studs with Gypsum plasterboard lining {{and are used}} in the construction of both the load bearing and non-load bearing walls in residential, industrial and commercial buildings.

An experimental study has shown that the strength of the studs in compression was increased significantly when they were lined with plasterboard on one or both sides. In order to fully understand the behaviour of one side lined steel <b>wall</b> <b>frames,</b> a detailed parametric study was undertaken using finite element analyses. A finite element model of one side lined <b>wall</b> <b>frame</b> was developed and validated using experimental results. This paper presents the details of the finite element modelling of one side lined steel <b>wall</b> <b>frames</b> and the results.

40|$|The {{performance}} of cold-formed steel (CFS) <b>wall</b> <b>frames</b> in residential building under extreme wind and seismic loading {{is a major}} concern in the construction industry. There is a little physical evidence to confirm the ability of such walls to resist horizontal loads (racking load). This leads the author to determine the racking capacity of a cold-formed steel <b>wall</b> <b>frame</b> that is commonly used in lightweight construction in the Northern Territory (NT). The behaviour of the <b>wall</b> <b>frame</b> when subjected to racking load is also investigated. A CFS <b>wall</b> <b>frame</b> normally consists of top and bottom tracks, vertical studs, bracing and connections, which may be assembled together on site (depending on the connection used) or manufactured in the factory. In this paper, experimental racking tests were performed on a CFS <b>wall</b> <b>frame</b> with aspect ratio of 1. 5 (2700 mm x 1800 mm) and compared to the computer-based Microstran results. The outcome of this study might provide recommendations and supporting information for building codes and design specifications which may lead to improved methods of designing the CFS <b>wall</b> <b>frames</b> in terms of its performance/capacity, material sizing and connections...|$|R
40|$|Gypsum {{plasterboard}} is {{a common}} lining material for steel <b>wall</b> <b>frame</b> systems used in combination with cold-formed steel studs (C or lipped C-sections). However, the design of these <b>wall</b> <b>frames</b> does not utilise the full strengthening effects of plasterboard in carrying axial loads. Therefore an experimental {{study was conducted to}} investigate the local and overall buckling behaviour of the studs in these frames using a total of 40 full-scale <b>wall</b> <b>frame</b> tests and stub column tests. The tests included unlined, both sides lined and one-side lined <b>wall</b> <b>frames</b> and studs. Test results were compared with predictions from the Australian standard AS 4600 - 1996 and the American specification AISI- 1996.

40|$|Cold-formed steel <b>wall</b> <b>frame</b> systems using lipped or unlipped C-sections and gypsum {{plasterboard}} lining are commonly utilised {{in the construction}} of both the load bearing and non-load bearing walls in the residential, commercial and industrial buildings. However, the structural behaviour of unlined and lined stud <b>wall</b> <b>frames</b> is not well understood and adequate design rules are not available. A detailed research program was therefore undertaken to investigate the behaviour of stud <b>wall</b> <b>frame</b> systems. As the first step in this research, the problem relating to the degree of end fixity of stud was investigated. The studs are usually connected to the top and bottom tracks and the degree of end fixity provided by these tracks is not adequately addressed by the design codes. A finite element model of unlined frames was therefore developed, and validated using full scale experimental results. It was then used in a detailed parametric study to develop appropriate design rules for unlined <b>wall</b> <b>frames.</b> This study has shown that by using appropriate effective length factors, the ultimate load and failure modes of the unlined studs can be accurately predicted using the provisions of Australian or American cold-formed steel structures design codes.

40|$|The finite strip {{method is}} used to {{determine}} the natural frequencies of shear <b>wall</b> <b>frame</b> buildings. The structure can be modelled in two different ways. In the first approach both the shear <b>walls</b> and the <b>frames</b> are idealized simply as an assemblage of finite strips varying thicknesses with given or computed properties, while in the second approach the shear walls are still idealized as a series of finite strips, but the frames are regarded as a number of long columns which are interconnected with each other or with finite strips through the horizontal beams. Numerical results obtained from both models indicate good agreement with finite element solutions. The proposed models can be applied {{to a wide range of}} shear <b>wall</b> <b>frame</b> assemblies and are therefore more versatile than most existing models. 14 refs. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

50|$|In {{architecture}} and in structural engineering, a joist {{is one of}} a series of horizontal members supporting a ceiling or floor. Joists are supported by foundations, <b>wall</b> <b>framing,</b> or beams. Joists are often laid out in repetitive patterns, much like the ribs of a human body. The intent of the use of this type of framing is to span over an open space below the members. When incorporated into a floor framing system, the joists also serve to provide stiffness to the subfloor sheathing, allowing it to function as a horizontal diaphragm. Joists are often doubled or tripled, placed side by side, where conditions warrant, such as where wall partitions require support.|$|E
50|$|Khan {{developed}} the shear <b>wall</b> <b>frame</b> interaction system for mid high-rise buildings.

The Brunswick building was completed in 1965 and became the tallest reinforced concrete structure of its time.
