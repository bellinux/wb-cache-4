5|$|In September 2008, Valve {{added support}} for Steam Cloud, {{a service that}} can {{automatically}} store saved game and related custom files on Valve's servers; users can access this data from any machine running the Steam client. Games must use the appropriate features of Steamworks for Steam Cloud to work. Users can disable this feature on a per-game and per-account basis. In May 2012, the service added the ability for users to manage their game libraries from remote clients, including computers and mobile devices; users can instruct Steam to download and install games they own through this service if their Steam client is currently active and running. Some games sold through retail channels can be redeemed as titles for users' libraries within Steam by entering a product code <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>software.</b> For games that incorporate Steamworks, users can buy redemption codes from other vendors and redeem these in the Steam client to add the title to their libraries. Steam also offers a framework for selling and distributing downloadable content (DLC) for games.|$|E

25|$|Because most of {{the above}} {{techniques}} are limited {{when it comes to}} the control of porosity and pore size, computer assisted design and manufacturing techniques have been introduced to tissue engineering.

The porosity can be tailored using algorithms <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>software.</b> The scaffold is then realized by using ink-jet printing of polymer powders or through Fused Deposition Modeling of a polymer melt.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, however, Sam Ramji, {{the then}} head of open source {{software}} strategy in Microsoft, began working closely with Bill Gates to develop a pro-open source attitude <b>within</b> <b>the</b> <b>software</b> industry as well as Microsoft itself. Ramji, before leaving the company in 2009, built Microsoft's familiarity and involvement with open source, which is evident in Microsoft's contributions of open source code to Windows Azure, “its new-age web service for building and hosting applications on the net”, among other projects. These contributions would have been previously unimaginable by Microsoft. Microsoft’s change in attitude about open source and efforts to build a stronger open source community is evidence of the growing adoption and adaption of open source.|$|E
