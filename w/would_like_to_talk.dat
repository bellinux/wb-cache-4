500|$|One filmed {{scene from}} [...] "Mamma Mia" [...] was cut {{out from the}} airing. Instead, the scene was {{featured}} on 30 Rocks season three DVD {{as part of the}} deleted scenes in the Bonus feature. In the scene, NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) gives George Park, Fred O'Dwyer, and Milton Greene a tour around the backstage area of TGS. Fred tells Kenneth that he resembles a man he served with in the service, which Kenneth says [...] "Well, obviously that's a coincidence. How could I be in Normandy?". Fred responds by saying that he never told Kenneth where he served. Jack shows up where Kenneth and the three men are, and tells Kenneth that he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to Milton, prompting Kenneth to tell Jack [...] "As head of this tour, I'm going to deny your request." [...] Jack and Milton are then seen at Jack's office.|$|E
2500|$|... "There was a {{guy named}} Dan Jones who was then about 60years old, who was a wino {{who lived in a}} fleabag in the bad part of town. Jones was well known to rescue. In June of '69 they got a call—man down—it was Jones. They put the paddles on him, he was in VF, started CPR, zapped him, he came back to sinus rhythm, brought him into ER and three days later he was out and walking around. In gratitude, about a week later, he came down to Station 1, which he had never done before, and he said he <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to the man who saved his life. They told me they had never seen Dan Jones in a clean shirt and sober, both of which he was that day. He would {{periodically}} come to the fire house and just say hello and he seemed to be sober. In my talks in those days I said this was the new cure for alcoholism. That was our first true save." ...|$|E
2500|$|Diane Sawyer interviewed O'Donnell in a March 14, 2002, {{episode of}} PrimeTime Thursday. O'Donnell told USA Today that {{she chose to}} talk to Sawyer because she wanted an investigative piece on Florida's ban on gay adoption. She told Sawyer if that was done, [...] "I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about my life and how (the case) {{pertains}} to me." [...] She spoke about the two gay men in Florida who faced having a foster child they raised removed from their home. State law wouldn't let them adopt because Florida banned gay or bisexual people from adopting. O'Donnell's coming out drew criticism from some LGBT activists who cited her repeated references to being enamored of Tom Cruise on The Rosie O'Donnell Show as deceptive. She responded in her act stating, [...] "I said I wanted him to mow my lawn and bring me a lemonade. I never said I wanted to blow him." [...] After leaving her show and coming out, O'Donnell returned to stand-up comedy, and cut her hair. O'Donnell told the press that her haircut was meant to mimic the haircut of former Culture Club backup singer Helen Terry.|$|E

2500|$|A {{few weeks}} before the game's launch, No Man's Sky was claimed to be using the superformula based on work done by Dr. Johan Gielis in 2003, and {{subsequently}} patented by Gielis under the Dutch company Genicap which Gielis founded and serves as Chief Research Officer. Murray had mentioned the superformula while describing the procedural generation aspects of the game in an interview with The New Yorker during development. Genicap anticipates developing a software tool using the superformula for their own product that they can see being used in video game development, which Hello Games would be infringing on if they had used the superformula in the game. The company states they have attempted to reach out to Hello Games to ask them about its use for No Man's Sky but have not received anything back. Genicap said {{they did not want to}} stop the launch of No Man's Sky, considered the game to be [...] "very impressive", and that they <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> more with Hello Games to exchange knowledge with them, but [...] "if the formula is used we'll need to have a talk". Murray replied that No Man's Sky does not use the superformula, and was working to arrange a meeting with Genicap to discuss the situation and their respective mathematics.|$|E

He had hoped to tire out his nerves as well as his body, but in this he had not succeeded. As soon as he had given up his tools, his brain began to work again more busily than ever. It followed Percy in his peregrinations through the city, trying to discover where those brutes were keeping Jeanne.|$|R
50|$|In the finale, Kira and the Muses {{perform for}} a packed house at Xanadu's grand opening, {{and after the}} final song, Kira and the Muses all return {{to the realm of}} the gods in {{spectacular}} fashion. With their departure, Sonny is understandably depressed. But that quickly changes when Danny asks for a drink for Sonny from one of the waitresses -- a waitress who looks exactly like Kira. Sonny approaches this seeming double and says he <b>would</b> just <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> her.

When Rimmer asks Camille, in Lister's presence, if she <b>would</b> <b>like</b> him <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> her through his {{collection}} of photographs of twentieth-century telegraph poles he seems to get a different answer from what Lister hears. This makes Lister suspicious so he questions Camille about it and she concedes [...] "that they would have found out eventually".

5000|$|In {{his first}} poetry collection, Naneun ije somyeol-e daehaeseo iyagiharyeonda (나는 이제 소멸에 대해서 이야기하련다 I <b>Would</b> Now <b>Like</b> <b>to</b> <b>Talk</b> About Disappearance), the poet sensually records {{the times that}} bears passed traces, and life’s scars. He delves into the moment of {{disappearance}} where the past, present {{and the future of}} a world comes together. With naturally given acute sensibility that enables him to sympathize with others, the poet has now arrived at his recent poetry collection Bultan jib (불탄 집 The Burnt House), taking a step forward from replaying the memory of disappearance toward holding the hands of the many struggling and hurt lives in the world now, thereby expanding the spectrum of his poetry. His poetry makes one feel the desperation for warmth amidst a painful life, which deeply moves his readers.|$|R
40|$|I {{must start}} {{by saying that}} I am {{somewhat}} torn between two ways of approaching this problem. On the one hand I <b>would</b> very much <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> in detail about programmes of community development, the way they can be organised, and their consequences. On the other hand I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> review some {{of the results of}} several survey investigations in which I have been involved and then go on <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> about ways in which I <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> see this work extended. Although these two courses of action are largely mutually exclusive as far as this evening’s paper is concerned I myself regard them as having a great deal of overlap...|$|R
