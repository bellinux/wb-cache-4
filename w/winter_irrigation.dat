40|$|<b>Winter</b> <b>irrigation</b> {{is one of}} {{the water}} and salt {{management}} practices widely adopted in arid irrigated areas in the Tarim Basin located in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the People’s Republic of China. A <b>winter</b> <b>irrigation</b> study was carried out from November 2013 to March 2014 in Korla City. A cotton field was divided into 18 plots with a size of 3 m × 3 m and five <b>winter</b> <b>irrigation</b> treatments (1200 m 3 /ha, 1800 m 3 /ha, 2400 m 3 /ha, 3000 m 3 /ha, and 3600 m 3 /ha) and one non-irrigation as a control were designed. The results showed that the higher <b>winter</b> <b>irrigation</b> volumes allowed the significant short-term difference after the irrigation in the fields with the higher soil moisture content. Therefore, the soil moisture in the next sowing season could be maintained at the level which was slightly lower than field capacity and four times that in the non-irrigation treatment. The desalination effect of <b>winter</b> <b>irrigation</b> increased with the increase of water irrigation volume, but its efficiency decreased with the increase of water irrigation volume. The desalination effect was characterized by short-term desalination, long-term salt accumulation, and the time-dependent gradually decreasing trend. During the <b>winter</b> <b>irrigation</b> period, air temperature was the most important external influencing factor of the soil temperature. During the period of the decrease in winter temperatures from December to January, soil temperature in the 5 -cm depth showed no significant difference in all the treatments and the control. However, during the period of rising temperatures from January to March, soil temperature in the control increased significantly, faster than that in all treatments. Under the same irrigation volume, the temperature difference between the upper soil layer and the lower soil layer increased during the temperature drop period and decreased during the temperature rise period. In this paper, we proposed the proper <b>winter</b> <b>irrigation</b> volume of 1800 – 3000 m 3 /ha and suggested that the irrigation timing should be delayed to early December or performed in several stages in the fields with the drainage system. Under the current strict water management and fixed water supply quota situation, the methods are of great practical significance...|$|E

The aim is to provide an alternative tillage and cultivation pattern for reducing plastic film pollution, saving cost and increasing income, and improving resource use efficiency. The {{field experiment}} was carried out in three soils with different textures and fertility levels. Three treatments for each soil were set up:(1) conventional tillage,winter irrigation, and new plastic mulching cultivation(NM);(2) no tillage, less <b>winter</b> <b>irrigation</b> and reused plastic mulching cultivation (RM);(3) no tillage, less <b>winter</b> <b>irrigation</b> and reused plastic mulching combined with straw mulching (RMS). The results showed that the average daily soil temperature in the two reused plastic mulching treatment(RM and RMS) during maize sowing and elongation stage was lower 0. 6 ~ 1. 0 ℃(5 cm depth) and 0. 5 ~ 0. 8 ℃(15 cm depth) than that in the NM. This result suggested that no tillage and reused plastic mulching cultivation still had the effect of increasing soil temperature. Maize grain yield in the RM was reduced by 4. 4 %~ 10. 6 % compared with the conventional cultivation(NM), while the net income increased due to saving in plastic film and tillage ex-penses. There was no significant difference in maize grain yield between the RMS and NM treatment, but the net income in the RMS was in-creased by 12. 5 %~ 17. 1 % than that in the NM.

This study aimed to evaluate alfalfa productivity and water use efficiency (WUE) under different sprinkler irrigation levels. This experiment was conducted at Shiyanghe Experimental Station for Water-Saving in Agriculture and Ecology of China Agricultural University in Wuwei, Gansu, China, over a period of two years. There were three irrigation treatments: A 1 : 100 % measured evapotranspiration (ETc) of alfalfa; A 2 : irrigation amount was 66 % of A 1; A 3 : irrigation amount was 33 % of A 1; and a control of A 4 : no irrigation during the growing season. A randomized block design with three replications were applied. The results showed that the ETc and forage yield of alfalfa decreased, while WUE and crude protein (CP) increased with the decreasing irrigation amounts. The seasonal average ETc and yield ranged from 412 mm to 809 mm and from 11, 577 to 18, 636 kg/ha, respectively, under different irrigation levels. The highest yields were obtained from the first growth period in all treatments in both years, due to the <b>winter</b> <b>irrigation</b> and the longest growth period. Alfalfa grown under lesser irrigation treatment conditions had higher variability in ETc and yield, mainly due to the variability in the amount of rainfall during the growth period. The seasonal average WUE of treatments ranged from 22. 78 to 26. 84 kg/(mm·ha), and the highest WUE was obtained at the first growth period, regardless of treatments. Seasonal average CP content ranged from 18. 99 % to 22. 99 %. A significant linear relationship was found between yield and ETc or irrigation amount, and the fitting results varied between growth periods and years. The present results also implied that <b>winter</b> <b>irrigation</b> provided the space for saving water and should be applied at the end of each growing season to fill the soil profile, and to maintain a greater yield in the next growing season.

40|$|Twelve, 19. 5 acre test plots {{arranged}} in a randomized complete block design are set within two 155 acre fields to provide a realistic production environment. These blocks of welldrained Panoche clay loam were formerly irrigated with California Aqueduct water and sprinklers for the last 30 years. Overall the field electrical conductivity (EC) ranged from 0. 5 to 4. 5, averaging 1. 57 dS/m to a 3 -foot depth. Saturation extract boron was 0. 6 ppm. The area is underlain by a semi-saline aquifer {{that has been made}} worse over the decades by contamination from oilfield leachate water. Several production wells were drilled in fall 2003 to begin using this water. A drip tape irrigation system was set up to allow the planting of 6 rows of cotton every 22 feet {{the first year of the}} project (2004) followed with the planting of 1 year old pistachio seedling rootstocks March 2005 in 22 foot rows interplanted with 4, 38 inch rows of pima cotton. Salinity of the shallow groundwater for the test fields has varied from 4 to 7. 5 dS/m with 8 to 11 ppm B. Three treatments were imposed: AQUEDUCT/CONTROL: EC ~ 0. 4 dS/m (Aqueduct water only), BLEND: EC ~ 2. 5 dS/m (50 / 50 mix) and WELL: EC ~ 5 dS/m. Chloride and boron contents in late season cotton petioles and pistachio leaf tissues were significantly higher in the WELL treatment compared to the Control. Saturation extract EC and B in the top three feet of rootzone were significantly increased in the BLEND and WELL treatments over the Control at the end of the season, with most salts increasing significantly to 3 feet with a significant increase in Cl to 5 feet. Cotton yield and tree development: Pima cotton lint yields were nearly 4 bale/acre in 2004, but crashed to about 2 bale/acre in 2005 due to very cool spring conditions that made for poor stand establishment. Cotton yields and plant height were unaffected by salinity. Spring 2006 provided excellent conditions for cotton growth, but excessive salts accumulated in the top 4 inches of the Well treatment beds reduced cotton emergence by 14 % (statistically insignificant) and lint yield from the saline Well treatment was reduced by 275 lb/ac compared to the Aqueduct water. However, the Well treatment yield was still excellent at 3. 12 bale/ac. Increase in pistachio rootstock diameter and general tree development was unaffected by salinity for both rootstocks for the first three years, but PG 1 rootstocks showed a significant 7 % decrease at the end of 4 th leaf (Figure 1). However, Photoshop® pixel counts of green foliage down the row show an equal amount of green foliage for all treatments as of 10 / 18 / 08. Salinity and sustainability: At the end of 2006, after three seasons of cotton irrigation this program applied about 6, 600, 32, 500 and 54, 000 lb/ac of salt in the Aqueduct, Blend and Well treatments, respectively. Rootzone salinity to 5 feet in the wettest part of the profile (between the two hoses) measured by Spring and Fall soil samples has remained surprisingly stable at about an ECe of 2. 5 dS/m for the Aqueduct and about 5 to 6 dS/m for the Well treatment. However, in-season ECe in the top two feet is much higher as water and salts sub up from the buried drip tape. Without 6 to 10 inches of effective rainfall or fresh water <b>winter</b> <b>irrigation</b> for efficient leaching this system may not be sustainable. Due to the decrease in cotton yield in 2006, combined with a 50 % increase in the Well water EC over the last four years we reduced the salinity of the Well treatment (by blending with Aqueduct water) down to 4. 5 dS/m. This is about the salinity of the Well at the start of the test in 2004. After one year of cotton and four years of drip tape irrigation in the pistachios a total of 73, 823 lb salt/wetted acre (about a 9. 5 foot wide zone of subbing) was applied in the active rootzone of the Well treatment compared to 8, 050 lb salt/wetted acre for Aqueduct water. At an average pima price of $ 1. 08 /lb, an economic analysis of cotton production and yields for the year prior to and first two years after planting pistachios shows a net return of $ 2, 120 for Aqueduct water @ $ 120 /ac-ft and $ 2, 249 for Well water @ $ 45 /ac-ft for this system...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} two decades, {{energy-saving}} solar greenhouses without heating systems, about 150 - 800 m(2) (width: 5 - 10 m, length: 30 - 80 m) in size, {{have been widely used}} in the North of China for vegetable production during cold seasons. The greenhouse is also suitable for use in other countries located in the temperate or warm-temperate zones, especially in the developing countries, because it is inexpensive with a simple structure, and does not need any additional energy for heating in <b>winter.</b> Drip <b>irrigation</b> has been recognized as a sensible method of supplying water inside the greenhouses, and a simple method for drip irrigation scheduling at low cost is urgently required. Using the water-balance method, the authors studied the water consumption of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) and the relationship between evapotranspiration and water surface evaporation measured with 20 cm pan. Research results show that there is no significant water flux at 0. 75 in depth when soil water potential is kept higher than - 20 kPa at 15 cm depth, and around 20 kPa at 60 cm depth. The accumulative value of evapotranspiration is approximately equal to the accumulative value of water surface evaporation measured using 20 cm pan. Further analysis found that 20 cm pan can be used to determine the water requirement of tomato drip irrigation scheduling in this type of greenhouse...|$|R

Experiments involving winter wheat with 1, 2, and 3 irrigation applications at jointing, heading, or milking were conducted, and the total irrigation water supplied was maintained at 120 Â mm. The results indicated that irrigation during the later part of the winter wheat growing season and increase in irrigation frequency decreased the available soil water; this result was mainly due to {{the changes in the}} vertical distribution of root length density. In 30 -cm-deep soil profiles, 1 time irrigation at jointing resulted in the highest root length density.

40|$|Improving {{winter wheat}} water use {{efficiency}} in the North China Plain (NCP), China {{is essential in}} light of current irrigation water shortages. In this study, the AquaCrop model was used to calibrate, and validate winter wheat crop performance under various planting dates and irrigation application rates. All experiments were conducted at the Xiaotangshan experimental site in Beijing, China, during seasons of 2008 / 2009, 2009 / 2010, 2010 / 2011 and 2011 / 2012. This model was first calibrated using data from 2008 / 2009 and 2009 / 2010, and subsequently validated using data from 2010 / 2011 and 2011 / 2012. The {{results showed that the}} simulated canopy cover (CC), biomass yield (BY) and grain yield (GY) were consistent with the measured CC, BY and GY, with corresponding coefficients of determination (R(2)) of 0. 93, 0. 91 and 0. 93, respectively. In addition, relationships between BY, GY and transpiration (T), (R(2)  = 0. 57 and 0. 71, respectively) was observed. These results suggest that frequent irrigation {{with a small amount of}} water significantly improved BY and GY. Collectively, these results indicate that the AquaCrop model can be used in the evaluation of various <b>winter</b> wheat <b>irrigation</b> strategies. The AquaCrop model predicted winter wheat CC, BY and GY with acceptable accuracy. Therefore, we concluded that AquaCrop is a useful decision-making tool for use in efforts to optimize wheat winter planting dates, and irrigation strategies...|$|R
40|$|In the Mediterranean {{areas where}} olive {{domestication}} originated, flowering {{of the tree}} occurs once florally induced buds receive sufficient chilling during the winter dormancy period, followed by warmer temperatures adequate for budburst and subsequent floral differentiation. In locations such as Tacna, Peru, where winter temperatures provide insufficient cold, flowering is traditionally stimulated by withholding irrigation. As an initial step for determining the specific requirements and potential of this system, we observed morphological and structural aspects of buds during <b>winter</b> dormancy <b>irrigation</b> witholding, and under budburst forcing following non-irrigated periods of different lengths. Buds and flowering were observed on current-year shoots from previously non-bearing trees of 'Frantoio' and 'Criolla', a prominent local cultivar. Floral budbreak capacity following 5, 6 and 9 weeks water-withholding periods was tested by forcing leafy cuttings from the affected trees in a greenhouse and monitoring morphogenetic changes. In both cultivars dormant buds presented 4 - 5 nodes and similar internal dimensions, and remained unchanged throughout the irrigation suspension period. Reproductive budburst on the cuttings did not occur following 5 weeks witholding, increased with successively longer periods, and was greater for 'Criolla' than 'Frantoio'. Comparison to buds of the same cultivars in standard winter dormancy conditions (Cordoba, Spain) indicated similar bud morphology and behavior to that observed with the irrigation suspension scenario. Flowering on shoots maintained on the trees confirmed {{the effectiveness of the}} irrigation withholding method for both cultivars. Overall, the greater and more rapid floral budbreak in 'Criolla' suggests it may be better adapted to the local climatic and cultivation conditions than 'Frantoio'. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
2500|$|The Western Cascades Lowlands and Valleys {{ecoregion}} comprises {{a network}} of steep ridges and narrow valleys on the lower slopes of the Cascade Mountains. Elevation varies from 600 to 4000 feet (183 to 1219 m). Its mild, wet climate promotes lush forests dominated by western hemlock and Douglas-fir, with western redcedar, bigleaf maple, red alder, vine maple, salal, rhododendron, Oregon grape, huckleberry, thimbleberry, swordfern, oxalis, hazel, and blackberry. Soils are warmer here than in higher elevation ecoregions, {{and it is one}} of the most important timber producing areas in the Pacific Northwest. The steep valleys trending to the west contain high and medium gradient rivers and streams that support cold water salmonids, including the threatened Chinook salmon, steelhead, and bull trout. Notable river drainages in Oregon include the North Umpqua, North and Middle Forks of the Willamette, McKenzie, North Santiam, South Santiam, Clackamas, Salmon and Bull Run River watersheds; and in Washington, the Lewis, Cowlitz, Nisqually, Puyallup, White, and Green River watersheds.

40|$|Atriplex canescens (Pursh) Nutt., Atriplex polycarpa (Torr.) Wats., and Atriplex lentiformis (Torr). Wats. {{have been}} {{considered}} candidate perennial shrubs for revegetation of abandoned farmlands in southern Arizona. Objectives of the 1992 - 1994 field studies were to investigate the establishment characteristics of populations of these species and to estimate water requirements for establishing transplants and/or seedlings under a line-source sprinkler irrigation system. During the summer on a sandy loam soil, seedling establishment occurred at total water amounts greater than 200 mm but was absent at amounts less than 150 mm The poor stand establishment was attributed to high soil temperatures at 1 to 3 -cm depth which were not optimum for seed germination. Transplant survival percentages were greater than 89 % except for accessions of A. canescens var. linearis (S. Wats.) Munz, which were affected by rabbit herbivory. Transplants were successfully established by planting into a wet soil profile followed by cumulative precipitation amounts of 60 to 70 -mm. Establishing Atriplex taxa during the summer using transplants was more promising than direct-seeding. On a silt loam soil during the 1993 winter, stand establishment was not increased under cumulative precipitation and irrigation amounts greater than 100 mm compared to 66 mm of precipitation. On a clay loam soil during the 1994 <b>winter,</b> supplemental <b>irrigations</b> increased the probability of seedling emergence and stand establishment was higher under total water amounts greater than 100 mm. Differences between years {{in response to the}} line-source irrigation gradient were attributed to the number of consecutive days when soil moisture at 1 to 3 -m depth was high for optimal seedling emergence. During the winter, plant heights were not affected by total water amounts between 182 to 248 -mm (1993) and between 119 to 150 -mm (1994), whereas heights were reduced at total water amounts less than 100 nun in 1993, and less than 90 mm for all species in 1994 except A. polycarpa. In southern Arizona where precipitation is erratic in amount and timing, supplemental irrigations may increase the probability of successful seedling establishment of Atriplex shrubs...|$|R
