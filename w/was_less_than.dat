The temperature dependencies of resistivity and thermopower have been measured. It {{was found that the}} S(T) dependencies take some additional features with Ca content increase. The results obtained have been analyzed {{on the basis of the}} phenomenological theory of electron transport in the case of the narrow conductive band. The main parameters of the band spectrum (the band filling with electrons degree and the total effective band width) have been determined. The dependencies of these from contents of substituting elements are discussed. Analyzing the results obtained simultaneously with the tendencies in oxygen content and critical temperature change we have confirmed the conclusion that the oxygen sublattice disordering has a determinant effect on band structure parameters and superconductive properties of YBa 2 Cu 3 O(y). The results obtained suggest that Ca gives rise to some peculiarities in band spectrum of this compound...|$|R

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} static aerodynamic {{simulation model}} of the 8 by 8 by 20 ft MILVAN cargo container is determined by combining the wind tunnel data from a 1972 NASA Ames Research Center study taken over the restricted domain (0 <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to phi <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to 90 degrees; 0 <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to alpha <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to 45 degrees) with extrapolation relations derived from the geometric symmetry of rectangular boxes.

In Vangaindrano district in southeastern Madagascar, the cyclone caused widespread flooding that isolated five villages, as well as covering fields of rice and other crops.
