25|$|Higher {{fields are}} {{possible}} by optimising the spherical design {{to take account}} {{of the fact that it}} is composed of point dipoles (and not line dipoles). This results in the stretching of the sphere to an elliptical shape and having a non-uniform distribution of magnetization over the component parts of the sphere. Using this method, as well as soft pole pieces within the design, 4.5T in a <b>working</b> <b>volume</b> of 20mm3 was achieved by Bloch et al. in 1998, and this was increased further to 5T in 2002, although over a smaller <b>working</b> <b>volume</b> of 0.05mm3.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Quantitative {{comparison}} of minimally invasive and standard cranial approaches remains a methodologic challenge. The {{aim of this}} study was to apply a new digital, navigation-based method to quantify multiple parameters of the pterional, supraorbital, lateral supraorbital and mini-pterional approaches and to describe a target-specific maneuverability score. METHODS: Supraorbital, lateral supraorbital, mini-pterional, and standard pterional craniotomies were performed on 8 sides in 4 cadaver heads. The limits of superficial and deep exposure and surgical target points were registered with image-guidance (Medtronic Stealth). A custom software (Guided Therapeutics Eyes II Software [GTxEyesII]) calculated superficial and deep surface areas, <b>working</b> <b>volumes,</b> and target distances. Volumes were reconstructed digitally and visualized with GTxEyesII. Finally, we defined for each approach a target-specific maneuverability score based on surface exposure, target distance, target position, and anatomical obstacles. RESULTS: Surface exposure and volumes were significantly smaller for keyhole approaches compared with standard pterional craniotomy (P < 0. 01). Maneuverability index scores showed the greatest values for standard pterional craniotomies, but nearly equally high scores could be achieved by one or several of the less-invasive approaches for most of the targets. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of a navigation-based measurement method with custom software (GTxEyesII) provides a powerful tool for visualization and quantification of surgical approaches. Compared with standard pterional craniotomy, alternative keyhole craniotomies offer comparable deep exposure with smaller <b>working</b> <b>volumes</b> and relatively high maneuverability for specific targets...|$|R

40|$|Continual {{monitoring}} of secreted biomarkers from organ-on-a-chip models is desired {{to understand their}} responses to drug exposure in a noninvasive manner. To achieve this goal, analytical methods capable of monitoring trace amounts of secreted biomarkers are of particular interest. However, a majority of existing biosensing techniques suffer from limited sensitivity, selectivity, stability, and require large <b>working</b> <b>volumes,</b> especially when cell culture medium is involved, which usually contains a plethora of nonspecific binding proteins and interfering compounds. Hence, novel analytical platforms are needed to provide noninvasive, accurate information {{on the status of}} organoids at low <b>working</b> <b>volumes.</b> Here, we report a novel microfluidic aptamer-based electrochemical biosensing platform for monitoring damage to cardiac organoids. The system is scalable, low-cost, and compatible with microfluidic platforms easing its integration with microfluidic bioreactors. To create the creatine kinase (CK) -MB biosensor, the microelectrode was functionalized with aptamers that are specific to CK-MB biomarker secreted from a damaged cardiac tissue. Compared to antibody-based sensors, the proposed aptamer-based system was highly sensitive, selective, and stable. The performance of the sensors was assessed using a heart-on-a-chip system constructed from human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes following exposure to a cardiotoxic drug, doxorubicin. The aptamer-based biosensor was capable of measuring trace amounts of CK-MB secreted by the cardiac organoids upon drug treatments in a dose-dependent manner, which was in agreement with the beating behavior and cell viability analyses. We believe that, our microfluidic electrochemical biosensor using aptamer-based capture mechanism will find widespread applications in integration with organ-on-a-chip platforms for in situ detection of biomarkers at low abundance and high sensitivity...|$|R
