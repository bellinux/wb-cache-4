Outside of the National Register of Historic Places boundary to the northwest of Old Pine Church lies a second parcel of land acquired around 1950 for additional burials. The cemetery is enclosed by a chicken wire fence supported by <b>wooden</b> <b>posts,</b> with a large gate {{to the north of}} the church which allows machinery access into the cemetery.|$|E
5|$|At {{times during}} the last interglacial period (130,000–70,000 BCE) Europe had a climate warmer than it is today, and early humans may have {{made their way to}} Scotland, though archaeologists have found no traces of this. Glaciers then scoured their way across most of Britain, and only after the ice retreated did Scotland again become habitable, around 9600 BCE. Mesolithic {{hunter-gatherer}} encampments formed the first known settlements, and archaeologists have dated an encampment near Biggar to around 8500 BCE. Numerous other sites found around Scotland build up a picture of highly mobile boat-using people making tools from bone, stone and antlers. The oldest house for which there is evidence in Britain is the oval structure of <b>wooden</b> <b>posts</b> found at South Queensferry near the Firth of Forth, dating from the Mesolithic period, about 8240 BCE.|$|E

5|$|In 1993, {{a remnant}} of the {{earliest}} known bridge-like structure in London was discovered alongside Vauxhall Bridge, when shifting currents washed away a layer of silt which had covered it. Dating to between 1550BC and 300BC, it consists of two rows of <b>wooden</b> <b>posts,</b> which it is believed would originally have carried a deck of some kind. It is believed {{that it did not}} cross the whole river, but instead connected the south bank to an island, possibly used for burial of the dead. As no mention of this or similar structures in the area is made in Julius Caesar's account of crossing the Thames nor by any other Roman author, it is presumed that the structure had been dismantled or destroyed prior to Caesar's expedition to Britain in 55BC. The posts are still visible at extreme low tides.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} newcomers {{represented the}} Linear Pottery culture. Their uniform culture survived in Poland {{in its original}} form until about 4600 BCE. Despite the big impact they made, the first waves came in small numbers - hundreds, or at most a few thousand people, judging by the sizes of the known settlements. They populated mainly fertile soils of southern highlands and river valleys further north, {{all the way to}} the Baltic Sea. They lived alongside the more numerous native people who were still pursuing the Mesolithic lifestyle, but during the Linear Pottery culture times there wasn't much interaction, as the two groups inhabited different environments. Their villages consisted of several, but sometimes up to a dozen or so rectangular communal long-houses, some over 30 meters long, supported by <b>wooden</b> <b>posts,</b> the oldest of which come from the Lower Silesia region. One such location from about 5000 BCE was also unearthed at Olszanica, which is now at the west end of Kraków just within the city limits.|$|E
5|$|The two-story brick {{structure}} {{is supported by}} a fieldstone foundation and still features its original front porch. The porch spans the length of the building's front (south) facade, at a height of about 6feet (1.8m). The porch is supported by four wooden pillars, which rest on stone bases. The stairs leading to the front porch are supported by two similar <b>wooden</b> <b>posts,</b> which, like the house, are set into fieldstone bases. The first step on the stairs was originally a limestone block embedded in the ground. The porch roof is supported by six wooden, bracketed pillars. The pillars are simple, with the brackets coming from the boxed capitals. At the rear of the porch wooden pilasters set at each end help to support the roof. Differentiating the home from the traditional French Colonial design is the porch roof, which is separate from the main roof.|$|E

5|$|The oldest {{house for}} which there is {{evidence}} in Britain is the oval structure of <b>wooden</b> <b>posts</b> found at South Queensferry near the Firth of Forth, dating from the Mesolithic period, about 8240 BCE. The earliest stone structures are probably the three hearths found at Jura, dated to about 6000 BCE. With the development of agriculture, groups of settlers began building stone houses on what is now Scottish soil in the Neolithic era, around 6,000 years ago, and the first villages around 500 years later. Neolithic habitation, burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well-preserved in the Northern and Western Isles, where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone. The stone building at Knap of Howar at Papa Westray, Orkney {{is one of the oldest}} surviving houses in north-west Europe, making use of locally gathered rubble in a dry-stone construction, it was probably occupied for 900 years, between 3700 and 2800 BCE. Skara Brae on the Mainland of Orkney also dates from this era, occupied from about 3100 to 2500 BCE and is Europe's most complete Neolithic village.|$|E
25|$|Briton Hammon {{reported}} that the Tequesta lived in huts or in 5 story houses. Other tribes in southern Florida lived in houses with <b>wooden</b> <b>posts,</b> raised floors, and roofs thatched with palmetto leaves, something like the chickees of the Seminoles. These houses may have had temporary walls of plaited palmetto-leaf mats to break the wind or block the sun.|$|E
25|$|Buildings were {{constructed}} using both poteaux-en-terre and poteaux-sur-sole techniques. In poteaux-en-terre construction, <b>wooden</b> <b>posts</b> are placed vertically into the ground. The gaps remaining between the posts {{were filled with}} a mixture of mud or clay and Spanish moss or hay. The mixture can be supplemented with small rocks. The walls are bound by a top plate and protected with plaster or siding. In poteaux-sur-sole construction, the floor of the building is elevated {{through the use of a}} bottom sill. The sill was formed by laying the wooden members directly on the ground. The elevation of the floor provided an airspace that minimized damage from moisture and insects. Since the conditions of the site were damaging against wooden structures, the poteaux-sur-sole structures would have been advantageous since their sill members could be more easily replaced than the <b>wooden</b> <b>posts</b> of a poteaux-en-terre structure. Exterior trenches suggest that palisade fences were used around some of the buildings.|$|E
50|$|The {{boundary}} markers were subsequently replaced {{on a regular}} basis. In 1736 a <b>wooden</b> <b>post</b> was erected and, in 1791, one made of stone. In 1844 a new post was made in oakwood.|$|R
50|$|Plumtree Mill was a two-storey <b>wooden</b> <b>post</b> mill {{mounted on}} an open trestle raised on piers atop a mound. Derelict by 1907, it was burnt down c. 1930. The mound is still extant.|$|R

25|$|The {{line was}} opened in 1911 {{to serve the}} Mont Park Asylum complex, with the {{construction}} expense met by the government Health Department. Electrification on the line was commissioned on 14 September 1928, five years after that on the main line. Steel stanchions were used to support the overhead wiring, {{in contrast to the}} <b>wooden</b> <b>posts</b> then used on single lines of railway in Melbourne.|$|E
25|$|The first temples {{were mostly}} mud, brick, and marble {{structures}} on stone foundations. The columns and superstructure (entablature) were wooden, door openings and antae were protected with wooden planks. The mud brick walls were often reinforced by <b>wooden</b> <b>posts,</b> in {{a type of}} half-timbered technique. The elements of this simple and clearly structured wooden architecture produced all the important design principles that were to determine the development of Greek temples for centuries.|$|E
25|$|The {{country of}} the Ifugao in the southeastern part of the Cordillera region {{is best known for}} its famous Banaue Rice Terraces, which in modern times have become one of the major tourist attractions of the Philippines. The Ifugaos build their typical houses called fales, which {{consists}} of a kitchen, bedroom and a worship room altogether. It is a triangular house elevated with 4 <b>wooden</b> <b>posts.</b> There is a ladder but it is hanged or removed so people or animals cannot enter the fale.|$|E

5000|$|Before {{the current}} {{windmill}} {{was built in}} 1803 as a gristmill, a <b>wooden</b> <b>post</b> mill was built in this location around 1400. In 1707, the <b>wooden</b> <b>post</b> mill was torn down and replaced with a stone mill. When this became too small, De Noord was built. In 1930, a diesel engine was added inside the windmill to keep production going {{when there was no}} wind. The engine is currently along the s' Gravelandseweg in Schiedam. From the 1930s and on, wind energy became less and less common, leading to the dismantling of De Noord in 1937. The beams, capstan wheel, cap, sail-cross and railings were all removed at that time.|$|R
25|$|In {{the initial}} excavation, two large hearths were found and many small ones as well. The remains of local animals were found, in {{addition}} to <b>wooden</b> <b>posts</b> from approximately twelve huts. Scraps of clothing made of hide were also found. This led archaeologists to estimate the population was around 20-30 inhabitants. A human footprint was {{also found in the}} clay, probably from a child. Inside the camp, archaeologists found a chunk of meat that still had preserved DNA. After a DNA analysis, it matched that of a gomphothere, indicating the type of food the inhabitants ate.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} feature of the farmhouse, albeit one which is not externally visible, is its internal, wooden, post-and-beam construction which supports the entire building. The frame was originally made of oak, which was very durable, but from the 18th century it was also made from cheaper pinewood. To protect it from damp, the <b>wooden</b> <b>posts</b> rest on a stone foundation about 50cm high, often made of fieldstone. The non weight-bearing external walls were built as timber frames, the panels of which were originally filled in with willow wickerwork and clay (wattle and daub) and, later, with brick.|$|E
25|$|The task of {{clearing}} the beach obstacles at Lingkas {{was assigned to}} the 2/13th Field Company. These defences comprised rows of barbed wire, <b>wooden</b> <b>posts</b> and steel rails which extended 125 yards from the beach. At 11:00 on 30 April, eight parties of engineers went forward in LVTs and landing craft to clear the obstacles. The engineers were supported by the guns on Sadau Island and Allied warships and aircraft. Operating under Japanese fire the engineers cleared all the obstacles obstructing the landing beaches. While heavy casualties had been expected, the 2/13th completed their task without loss.|$|E
5000|$|In 1793 Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson {{surveyed}} {{and marked}} with a <b>wooden</b> <b>post</b> the southwest vertex of L'Enfant's triangle, establishing the second Washington meridian, the one through the President's house. The <b>wooden</b> <b>post</b> {{was replaced by the}} Jefferson Pier in 1804, while Jefferson was President of the United States. After removal and replacement several times, it was permanently replaced in 1889 by a 2 ft, 2-foot-tall, granite pier, now 390 ft WNW of the center of the Washington Monument. NGS gives its longitude as 77°02'11.56258"W (NAD 83) [...] (likely error less than a centimeter). Azimuth to the Capitol is 89.98 degrees, a discrepancy of just under a meter.|$|R

25|$|Parma {{initially}} had {{no permanent}} home {{and used the}} Piazza d'Armi, where two <b>wooden</b> <b>posts</b> constituted the frame of each goal. In December 1914, the club began to use land between the Via Emilia, the Eridania refinery and the Ferraguti factory, but it was sold, so the club returned to the Piazza d'Armi before transferring to the Tre Pioppi, the first fenced-off pitch in the city. Parma moved into the Stadio Ennio Tardini in 1923 and remained there today, although the stadium saw drastic change from the vision of Ennio Tardini, under whose auspices the stadium was to be built, but who died before completion of the venue. Much of the renovation took place after the club's first promotion to Serie A {{at the start of}} the 1990s.|$|E
25|$|Evidence of Neolithic {{settlement}} can {{be found}} throughout the county. There are great burial mounds including the portal tombs and dolmens at Owning, Kilmogue-Harristown and Borrismore. There are passage graves at Clomantagh Hill and Knockroe. There were non-megalith single-grave burial tombs, Linkardstown-type Cists, excavated at Jerpoint West. These are late Neolithic and before the single-grave rite of the Bronze Age. A Neolithic house was identified in Granny near Waterford, making it the oldest house in County Kilkenny. The square house consisted of slot-trenches, internal floor surfaces, a hearth and <b>wooden</b> <b>posts</b> at each corner, one of the post-holes was radiocarbon-dated to 3997-3728 BC. A new form of early Neolithic pottery with a lip around {{the inside of the}} rim were found. This Granny pottery is similar to pottery found in the south-east of England.|$|E
40|$|Wood is a {{competitive}} material to metal and concrete {{in the production}} of bearing members. These wooden bearing members are increasingly applied in building constructions. By reason of its natural character and properties, this material improves the architectural look of the structure, and hence it is suitable for use in different constructions. Design feature – hollow <b>wooden</b> <b>post</b> is produced by gluing 12 lamellas with trapezoidal cross-section, furnished with slip feather and groove. Each lamella side is cut at an angle of 15 ° in order to achieve a closed circle in itscross-section. Hollow <b>wooden</b> <b>post</b> is especially made of spruce timber. Wood–steel structural joints between individual structural members have a very important role in wooden structural constructions...|$|R
