40|$|The paper {{deals with}} CFD {{simulations}} of a reinforced exhaust system (the Aaberg exhaust hood in particular). The reinforced suction effect {{is achieved by}} means of radial jet release. The radial jet deforms the flow pattern {{in front of the}} hood to a directional flow pattern. Unfortunately, the presence of an obstacle, such as a <b>welding</b> <b>bench,</b> leads to a defective operation of the hood. A number of CFD simulations has been undertaken in order to assess the effect of the obstacle size, its distance to the hood, and the hood declination from the normal of the obstacle surface, on the flow pattern and consequently the capture efficiency of the hood. Capture efficiency of selected cases was evaluated. For the purpose of capture efficiency evaluation, a heat source was defined within the model that imitated a metal arc welding process and introduced similar heat input into the domain altogether with a release of a passive scalar. The scalar concentration was then evaluated at the hood opening, thus capture efficiency could be calculated. The results of simulations indicate that the hood operation depends on the spatial arrangement of the hood and the obstacle. The best performance was achieved when the hood axis was aligned with the obstacle surface normal or the misalignment was small. Greater misalignment can be tolerated when the obstacle size is smaller than the hoodtoobstacle distance only...|$|E
