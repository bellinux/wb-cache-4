30|$|For {{high-order}} WENO reconstructions, say, of 2 k+ 1 th-order of accuracy, <b>we</b> first <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> k+ 1 small templates S_τ, τ= 0,...,k, {{the cell}} I_j {{is part of}} each of them.

We built a kth degree polynomial reconstruction {{in each of the}} cells S_τ, τ= 0,...,k, which is indicated by H_τ(x). Namely, the cell average of H_τ(x) in the template S_τ is in accord with the given cell average of v. Analogously, associated with the larger stencil S, we also find a (2 k)th-order polynomial, G(x). The details of reconstructing the polynomials H_τ(x) and G(x) can be learned, for example, from [26].|$|R

But <b>we</b> also <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> that digital facsimiles are objects in and of themselves—they are not surrogates, but primary sources for our research.

40|$|Resilience, adaptability, and transformability are all tightly {{linked to}} the notion of change, whether in respect to coping with, {{adapting}} to, or harnessing it. But in order to understand these forces of change, <b>we</b> first <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> its counterpart: identity. Identity of a social-ecological system is not merely a static set of quantifiable feedbacks or indicators, but a more qualitative characterization of what results from the overlap of the social and the ecological. To fully articulate these ideas, I turn to a unique and enduring phenomenon: the traveling circus. Through the many forms they have taken over the last 150 yr, circuses have changed significantly while sustaining a singular identity. As a successful and enduring social system, their intriguing history exposes the nuances of sustainability theory, from resilience to pathologies, and illustrates that sustainability requires a complex dynamic between identity, tradition, and change...|$|R
50|$|Simon Burgess {{has argued}} that <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> two stages to the problem. The first stage is that before which the {{predictor}} has gained all the information on which the prediction will be based. If, for example, we suppose that the prediction is at least partially based on a brain scan of the player then the first stage will not be over at least until that brain scan has been taken. An important point to appreciate {{is that while the}} player is still in that first stage, they will presumably be able to influence the predictor's prediction (e.g., by committing to taking only one box). The second stage commences after the completion of the brain scan (and/or after the gathering of any other information on which the prediction is based). As Burgess points out, the first stage is the one in which all of us currently find ourselves. Moreover, there is a clear sense in which the first stage is more significant than the second because it is then that the player can determine whether the $1,000,000 is in box B. Once they get to the second stage, the best that can be done is to determine whether to get the $1,000 in box A.|$|E

Our present situation is that of a “tragedy of the commons”, to borrow the title of biologist Garrett Hardin’s famous essay — or, as he later modified his resonant phrase, “the tragedy of the unregulated commons”. The example set out by Hardin was that of graziers sharing a pasture, each receiving a marginal personal benefit by increas-ing the size of their herd, but all losing as a result, as the pro-ductivity of the overgrazed pasture diminishes: “The rational herdsman concludes that the only sensible course for him to pursue is to add another animal to his herd [...] . But this is the conclusion reached by each and every rational herdsman sharing a commons. Therein is the tragedy. Each man is locked into a system that compels hi...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In object recognition, the {{required}} features to represent an object are {{dictated by the}} nature of the problem at hand, and thus extraction of features from an object varies from task to task. State-of-the-art object detectors typically use the shape information as a low level feature representation to capture the local structure of an object. This paper presents the concept of merging the shape (in the form of edge) and color information, which could lead to significant performance improvement in object detection. In real life scenarios, <b>we</b> often <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> objects that are captured at different angles. In this paper, we propose a method that capture the RGB colors along the image’s edge as importance features for object recognition. We test our method on NEC animal object dataset. Our simple yet effective approach is able to offer good image classification results when we use it in conjunction with random forest ensemble learning method for classification.

40|$|The Ostrom social-ecological system (SES) {{framework}} {{offers an}} interdisciplinary tool for studies of linked human-natural systems.

To narrow the gap between inherently dynamic ecological systems and the SES framework, <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> explicitly <b>recognize</b> that SES outcomes are coproduced by social systems in which choices are made, as well as an ecological system with a diverse assortment of dynamic natural processes that mediate the effect of those choices. <b>We</b> illustrate the <b>need</b> for more explicit incorporation of ecological attributes into the SES framework by presenting a case study of a community-managed forest in Indiana, USA.

40|$|In {{the search}} for life on Mars and other {{extraterrestrial}} bodies, how do we recognize life or the remains of ancient life when we find it? <b>We</b> will <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>recognize</b> residual patterns left by life.

In this thesis, we investigate the nature of elementary cellular automata to better understand their relationship of the models they support to the biological organisms that create the mats and soil crusts found in extreme environments here on earth. A better understanding of cellular automata will also make it possible for us to match the cellular automata more effectively to the biological area being modeled. This investigation has led us to develop a graphical grammar for simple cellular automata, using L-systems, a grammar system designed by a biologist, Aristid Lindenmayer, to describe growth in biological systems. We also discuss scaling algorithms, and the associated variable dependencies that create them. Future directions for research in both modeling wit...|$|R
