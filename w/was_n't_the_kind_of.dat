40|$|Hillel Schwartz’s Making Noise: From Babel to the Big Bang and Beyond <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{merely a}} text to be read; it’s also an object to be grappled with. One must create space for it, adopt a proper reading posture to {{accommodate}} it, {{and listen to}} it—both to {{the words on the}} pages and to the pages themselves. At 9 ¼ in. x 6 ¼ in. x 2 3 / 8 in., Making Noise <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of book one can easily tuck into a bag for subway reading. In fact, in the two months I spent working through <b>the</b> text, <b>not</b> once did I manage to find sufficient spare space in my bag to lug it to school or to a coffee shop; consequently, I read the book entirely in my apartment—in a familiar and relatively quiet acoustic environment, which may have set Schwartz’s babble and bang into acoustic relief. In addition, Making Noise <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of book one can easily read while lying on the couch; its 2. 5 pounds tired my wrists far too quickly. As a result, I read the entire book sitting or standing up, or while lying on my stomach on the living room carpet. I never experienced Schwartz with my head cocooned in a pillow, down and cloth providing acoustic insulation. Consequently, as I read, I became more conscious of the symphony of white noises—humming refrigerators and whirring hard drives—filling my seemingly quiet Brooklyn apartment...|$|R
50|$|A {{commentator}} {{asserted that}} an example illustrating {{the proposition that}} satisfying <b>the</b> machine-or-transformation test <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a sufficient condition for patent-eligibility occurs in U.S. Pat. No. 6,701,872. This patent covers a method and apparatus (machine) for entertaining a cat by using a moving laser beam (relatively high technology). The method is implemented with a “particular machine”—“a rotating laser source mounted directly on a shaft driven directly by a motor mounted on a portable pedestal” (method claim 14). But it is debatable whether entertaining a cat may be considered a useful Art, and some may argue that this “discovery” <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>kind</b> of discovery that the Patent Clause contemplates.|$|R

I can't get out of my head why Test matches are so different from State matches, where I think England played pretty well. It is all so different from what we visualised. After all this talk of brighter cricket I think we should get back to playing cricket. Perhaps a little more action and less talk.|$|R
