500|$|Nixon {{was already}} {{arranging}} to research Voorhis's record {{and to meet}} with Republican leaders in Washington, including House Minority Leader (and future Speaker) Joseph W. Martin, Jr. [...] The newly minted candidate wrote to Day regarding Voorhis, [...] "His 'conservative' reputation must be blasted. But my main efforts are being directed toward building up a positive, progressive group of speeches which tell {{what we want to}} do, not what the Democrats have failed to do... I'm really hopped up over this deal, and I believe we can win." [...] However, [...] "" [...] Republicans deemed Nixon's campaign hopeless. [...] Nixon was a virtual unknown outside of his hometown of Whittier and was facing a popular and respected incumbent. [...] Charles Voorhis wrote his son that the Republicans had endorsed a Quaker named Richard Nixon, but hoped that his son would retain {{a large part of the}} Quaker vote. The elder Voorhis was confident that his son would triumph again, writing, [...] "It is just another campaign that we have to go through... In any event, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> worry about now." ...|$|E
500|$|Bolt's record-setting runs caused {{commentators}} {{not only}} to praise his achievements but also to speculate about his potential {{to become one of}} the most successful sprinters ever. Critics hailed his Olympic success as a new beginning for a sport that had long suffered through high-profile drug scandals. The previous six years had seen the BALCO scandal, Tim Montgomery and Justin Gatlin stripped of their 100 m world records, and Marion Jones returning three Olympic gold medals. All three sprinters were disqualified from athletics after drugs tests detected banned substances in their systems. Bolt's record-breaking performances caused suspicion among some commentators, including Victor Conte, and the lack of an independent Caribbean anti-doping federation raised more concerns. The accusations of drug use were vehemently rejected by Glen Mills (Bolt's coach) and Herb Elliott (the Jamaican athletics team doctor). Elliott, a member of the IAAF anti-doping commission, urged those concerned about the issue to [...] "come down and see our programme, come down and see our testing, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> hide". Mills had been equally ardent that Bolt was a clean athlete, declaring to the Jamaica Gleaner: [...] "We will test any time, any day, any part of the body... doesn't even like to take vitamins". Bolt stated that he had been tested four times prior to the Olympics, and all had tested negative for banned substances. He also welcomed anti-doping authorities to test him to prove that he was clean, stating, [...] "We work hard and we perform well and we know we're clean".|$|E

2500|$|Both {{the union}} and {{management}} held to an intransigent all-or-nothing attitude toward the other. From the start, the union leaders refused to negotiate compromise with the mine owners. In July 1896, the Colorado deputy commissioner of labor urged the union leadership to submit their issues to arbitration, but they rejected the idea, saying: [...] "No; <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> arbitrate." [...] The unionists, not knowing of the owners' secret unity pact, believed that the mine owners would give in one-by-one.|$|E

2500|$|In the 2011 United States federal budget, Wolf {{inserted}} a clause prohibiting NASA and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy from any joint scientific activity with China {{for the remainder}} of the 2011 fiscal year.

[...] And frankly, it boils down to a moral issue. ... Would you have a bilateral program with Stalin?"

2500|$|In 1905, Richards and Comstock {{were indicted}} {{and brought to}} trial for the illegal fencing of [...] of {{government}} land.

Hall told the court as the plea was entered for his clients:"It is our intention {{to comply with the}} law.

2500|$|The Hungarians, however, were {{repeatedly}} {{defeated by}} the Romanians. By the middle of July 1919, Hungary had begun a major offensive against the Romanian invasion. The Allied Commander in the Balkans, the French Marshal Louis Franchet d'Esperey, wrote to Marshal Ferdinand Foch on 21 July 1919: [...] "We {{are convinced that the}} Hungarian offensive will collapse of its own accord... When the Hungarian offensive is launched, we shall retreat to the line of demarcation and launch the counteroffensive from that line. Two Romanian brigades will march from Romania to the front in the coming days, according to General Fertianu's promise. You see, Marshal, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> fear from the Hungarian army. I can assure you that the Hungarian Soviets will last no {{more than two or three}} weeks. And should our offensive not bring the Kun regime down, its untenable internal situation surely will.|$|E

"At {{this moment}} I believe neither Captain Bligh of the Bounty, nor Christian, had entered {{any of our}} thoughts, and in waiting the {{approach}} of the strangers, we prepared to ask them some questions in the language of those people we had so recently left.

The Captain answered, and now a regular conversation commenced. He requested them to come alongside, and the reply was, [...] " [...] We have no boat hook to hold on by." [...] "I will throw you a rope" [...] said the Captain. [...] "If you do <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> make it fast to" [...] was the answer. However, they at length came on board, exemplifying not the least fear, but their astonishment was unbounded." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{document}} was online for only an hour, but {{long enough to}} be viewed by some readers. Soon after, the Houston Review, a conservative newspaper published by students at the University of Houston, printed the memo's full text and an accompanying commentary that criticized the paper.

Its first official response appeared in the [...] "corrections" [...] section later the same week stating: [...] "An internal Houston Chronicle {{document was}} mistakenly posted to the editorial/opinion area of the Web site early Thursday morning.

[...] Chronicle editor Jeff Cohen, who gave a statement in defense of the memorandum: [...] "I make no apologies for having a thorough discussion of the issue. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> apologize for…There was an inadvertent posting of it to the Web site, and I'm sorry about that, but I make no apologies for the contents of it." ...|$|E

I don't think anybody's test is as vigorous as the test administered by the Olympic Organization. And we can arrange for the Olympic Organization to handle the test {{under the supervision of}} the Athletic commission respective of the state where the fight is going to be held." [...] However, the following day, Pacquiao's top adviser, Michael Koncz, stated that Pacquiao had never agreed to testing all the way up to fight day.

60|$|In passing this wilderness, which, I confess, was at {{the first}} view very frightful to me, we saw {{two or three times}} little parties of the Tartars, but they seemed to be upon their own affairs, and to have no design upon us; and so, like the man who met the devil, if they <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> say <b>to</b> us, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> say to them; we let them go.|$|R

2500|$|The United States {{initially}} voiced {{opposition to}} his election {{to a third}} four-year term in 2005. In a May 2005 interview with {{the staff of the}} U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Lawrence Wilkerson, the chief of staff to former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell, charged former Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security John Bolton with an underhanded campaign to unseat ElBaradei. [...] "Mr. Bolton overstepped his bounds in his moves and gyrations to try to keep [...] from being reappointed as [...] head," [...] Wilkerson said. The Washington Post reported in December 2004 that the Bush administration had intercepted dozens of ElBaradei’s phone calls with Iranian diplomats and was scrutinizing them for evidence [...] they could use to force him out. IAEA spokesman Mark Gwozdecky said the agency worked on [...] "the assumption that one or more entities may be listening to our conversations." [...] "It's not how we would prefer to work, but it is the reality. At the end of the day, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> hide," [...] he said.

2500|$|You Couldn't Make It Up (1995, Heinemann, [...] ) – {{named after}} one of Littlejohn's catchphrases, and {{described}} [...] on the jacket as [...] "a brilliant collection of liberal-skewering wit and wisdom", {{this is a book}} of recollections and opinion pieces on subjects such as political correctness, politicians, corporate [...] "fat cats", the European Union, and the British Royal Family. Anthony Daniels, writing in The Daily Telegraph, said: [...] "...not only does he never mention foreigners in any but a derogatory way – when he is far too intelligent a man really to believe that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> learn from any of them – but when he writes of the Germans and the Japanese as having taken our cars and electronics industries he is pandering to the kind of stupid, ignorant, sentimental, self-pitying xenophobia which is the root of all fascism, and which is an obstacle to genuine self improvement."

But there were some calls out there we should have had." [...] "I'm not going {{to walk out of}} here crying", Redskins coach Joe Gibbs added. [...] "We got beat fair and square. I did think there were some things called wrong. Rice outweighs Darrell Green by 20 pounds and gets 15 yards (for Green's flinging tackle). That's hard to understand."

2500|$|In {{his third}} year, he joined John Stevens Henslow's natural history course and was {{introduced}} to the Cambridge version of natural theology, part of the liberal Christianity of colleagues such as Adam Sedgwick, George Peacock and William Whewell who all had strong views about science as the search for the laws of nature. Study of nature was study of the work of the Lord, and scientists who were ordained clerics of the Church of England, such as themselves, could follow their enquiries without theological difficulties. Sedgwick gave a talk to the Geological Society of London in 1831 which declared that [...] "No opinion can be heretical, but that which is not true.... Conflicting falsehoods we can comprehend; but truths can never war against each other. I affirm, therefore, that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>to</b> fear from the results of our enquiries, provided they be followed in the laborious but secure road of honest induction. In this way we may rest assured that we shall never arrive at conclusions opposed to any truth, either physical or moral, from whatever source that truth may be derived." [...] For these men, science could not be out of harmony with religion, and in a sense it was religion.|$|E
