5|$|On 28 January 2011, Michael Paget {{stated that}} the group had already drawn {{proportions}} for the next studio album and <b>will</b> <b>sound</b> a lot like Fever. He followed-along with stating that the band plans to have the songs for it written within 2011 and will begin recording the album {{by the end of}} the year. A couple tracks left from the Fever sessions might be re-done, re-arranged and re-recorded for the new record. The band played at Uproar Festival 2011, after which they began writing material for a fourth studio album.|$|E
5|$|In {{completing}} missions, {{the player}} can have Talion engage in melee, ranged combat, and stealth approaches, with some missions rewarding the player more for completing the mission {{in a specific}} manner. Talion's ranger abilities are enhanced through Celebrimbor, allowing the player to mix combat with special focus-based attacks; these latter attacks {{can be used to}} slow time down while aiming with the bow, drain focus out of an enemy foe, or, later in the game, brand the foe to become an ally of Talion. The combat system uses an attack-chain system that enables the player to perform special moves after building the chain to a large enough value, such as instantly draining a foe of focus or performing an area focus attack. With the combat system, they can also counter and dodge attacks. Stealth is a critical element in some missions; several areas are considered Strongholds and should Talion's presence be discovered, an alarm <b>will</b> <b>sound</b> and more Uruks will arrive to try to kill him.|$|E

Other performers of his works (often in arrangement for live musicians) include Thomas Adès, Alarm <b>Will</b> <b>Sound</b> and ensemble Calefax from the Netherlands who also recorded the Studies for player piano, called 'Best CD of 2009' by Dutch newspaper Het Parool. American clarinetist and composer Evan Ziporyn has adapted a number of Nancarrow's player piano studies for the Bang on a Can All-Stars to perform live.|$|E
25|$|Emergency {{vehicles}} are sent on runs {{by a number}} of means. The most common system is by pager, issued to every crew. Pagers may operate on either an analog or a digital system. Analog pagers will silently listen on the air for a 5-tone signal being transmitted. Once the individual signal for that pager is detected, the pager <b>will</b> <b>sound</b> an alarm, and will often open the channel for the crew to hear the dispatcher. Further information is being given via radio. The digital pagers will listen on a different channel and once its individual address is transmitted, will prepare to receive a data package. This package normally consists of a short message, providing the address and nature of the emergency as well as additional information. This clears the radio channel of lengthy calls. Theoretically, no additional radio traffic is required when using such a system.|$|E

25|$|When {{performing}} lossy audio encoding, such {{as creating}} an MP3 data stream, {{there is a}} trade-off {{between the amount of}} data generated and the sound quality of the results. The person generating an MP3 selects a bit rate, which specifies how many kilobits per second of audio are desired. The higher the bit rate, the larger the MP3 data stream will be, and, generally, the closer it <b>will</b> <b>sound</b> to the original recording. With too low a bit rate, compression artifacts (i.e., sounds that were not present in the original recording) may be audible in the reproduction. Some audio is hard to compress because of its randomness and sharp attacks. When this type of audio is compressed, artifacts such as ringing or pre-echo are usually heard. A sample of applause compressed or an excerpt of triangle instrument with a relatively low bit rate provides a good example of compression artifacts. Most subjective testings on perceptual codecs tend to avoid using this type of extremely critical sound materials however this type of artifacts generated by percussive sounds is barely perceptible on the MP3 format due to the specific temporal masking feature of the 32 sub-band filterbank of Layer II on which the MP3 format is based.|$|E
500|$|The mixing {{started at}} Chalice Recording Studios, but moved to Grohl's house as {{engineer}} Alan Moulder {{said it was}} the way [...] "to make it sound like your garage." [...] Since Grohl's mixing console was not automated, at times four people—Vig, Grohl, Moulder and engineer James Brown—had to work simultaneously on the board, something Grohl found interesting because every song was done differently and [...] "even the mixes sounded like performances" [...] The mixes were tested out in the cars of the band members and Vig, as they felt that [...] "if it sounds good on a lousy stereo, it <b>will</b> <b>sound</b> good anywhere".|$|E

[...] Samantha Craggs of The Electric Playground praised Obi-Wan's Adventures for its interesting gameplay {{and the use of}} the lightsaber. She commented: [...] "There are quite a few things to like about this game. For one thing, you can't underestimate the feeling of moving across the floor wielding a deadly lightsaber. Also, the levels are interesting. [...] In , Obi-Wan is actually in a boat, going through the Naboo swamp, while battle droids shoot at him from the banks. While you're essentially fighting the same enemies in the same manner, there are enough twists in the level designs to interest you in continuing." ...|$|E

500|$|Mike Diver of the BBC {{wrote that}} [...] "Oh Santa!" [...] is a [...] "boisterous" [...] song which [...] "makes perfect sense" [...] as a lead single. He {{continued}} {{to write that}} although it fell substandard to [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You", it would still [...] "warrant revisiting 12 months down the line". Rolling Stone writer Caryn Ganz commented on the composition, writing [...] "Mariah bops to a schoolyard-chant beat". Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle described the song as [...] "irresistible" [...] and predicted that it would [...] "dominate ringtones" [...] in the run up to Christmas. A reviewer for Idolator described the track as a Christmas version of a song by Avril Lavigne song, [...] "Presumably, not every track <b>will</b> <b>sound</b> like a North Pole version of Avril Lavigne’s 'Girlfriend' as the boppy 'Oh Santa!' does". Rich Juzwiak of The Village Voice was critical of the song, writing [...] "Of the four Mariah-penned new tracks, the Jermaine Dupri/Bryan-Michael Cox collaboration 'Oh Santa!' tries the hardest, an antique kitchen-sink replica that manages to invoke a cheerleading squad, the Pointer Sisters, Mariah's own 'Loverboy', and Hey Ya!'. Full of mumbling and cattiness, it's difficult to sing along to, so its prospects of becoming a perennial favorite are dim." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{songs are}} {{selected}} as stand-outs throughout the album. [...] "Tug of War" [...] is labelled as [...] "the strongest {{song on the}} album", with John D. Luerssen writing that [...] "the cohesiveness of the material suggests the lads in Kid Kilowatt exited this side project as friends. After all, only buddies capable of putting their differences aside could craft the soaring, majestic [...] "Tug of War," [...] where Brodsky's wide-reaching pipes mesh brilliantly with KK's ace musicianship". He continues to say that [...] "the disc shifts from roaring, expansive rockers like [...] "Bicycle Song" [...] to crunching anthems like [...] "Ted Nugent" [...] and on to lilting, near-ballads like [...] "Memorial Drive" [...] with inexplicable ease". Moore writes that [...] "The Scope" [...] "encapsulates {{what the rest of}} the album <b>will</b> <b>sound</b> like. It starts out sounding rather crunchy and smooths out as the album progresses, providing a good contrasting effect that runs throughout the album". Moore, however, writes that [...] "Memorial Drive" [...] is [...] "only mediocre. It's the only song on the album over five minutes long. Playing slow just isn't this band's forte, although they have the ability to write poignant lyrics". Similarly, a ScenePointBlank review states that [...] "Cadence for a Rainy Day" [...] and [...] "Memorial Drive" [...] "often diverge and lead the listener off-course".|$|E
500|$|... "Lift Off" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics. Before {{the song was}} released, MTV News' Alvin Blanco heard {{a preview of the}} song and described it as [...] "resounding... sounds like it was tailor-made to be performed in large stadiums." [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the song [...] "is rescued by Beyoncé, who whips the chorus with a belt so powerful you'd think it insulted her mother." [...] Slant Magazines Matthew Cole also praised the song writing, [...] "'Lift Off' is a study in stylized blockbuster excess, with West's best fanfare since Encore eventually being drowned out by a simulated rocket launch that <b>will</b> <b>sound</b> awesome in your car stereo provided it doesn't cause your subwoofers to bust your windows." [...] Rob Harvilla of Spin found a [...] "hook so ridiculous ('We gon take it to the moon / Take it to the stars!') that only Beyoncé could sell it." [...] Michaelangelo Matos of The Guardian praised the song calling it [...] "bombastic". Digital Spys Robert Copsey put [...] "Lift Off" [...] on his list of [...] "Tracks to download" [...] from the album. Evening Standards John Aizlewood called the song [...] "rocket-propelled". Rolling Stones Matthew Perpetua commented: [...] "Beyoncé joins the boys for a synth-heavy banger that takes off like a rocket and eventually arrives at a spacey, blissful resolution. It all but demands a sci-fi music video featuring Beyoncé as a sexy astronaut." ...|$|E
