5000|$|In modern {{expansion}} joints, {{the metal}} bellows are often produced with a so-called multi-ply design. To increase both flexibility and stability, multiple thin plies of metal are layered {{to form the}} bellows walls. There are two basic design types: The multi-ply and the multi-walled bellows structure. The multi-ply structure consists of a pressure-tight, longitudinally welded outer and inner cylinder of stainless steel. In between these cylinders is an open, spiral cylinder which forms multiple plies depending on the design. The multi-walled structure consists of several concentric, longitudinally <b>welded</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Each cylinder forms a pressure-tight and closed [...] "wall".|$|R
5000|$|On {{individual}} classes (Class 58.30), {{completely new}} driver's cabs were built, {{instead of just}} fitting the new end walls needed after the boiler had been replaced. The worn cast cylinder blocks were sometimes replaced by <b>welded</b> <b>cylinders.</b> Unlike the Deutsche Bundesbahn's conversion programme, the boilers were not matched to the individual locomotive classes, but the locomotives were matched to the new boilers. The price paid for the easy interchangeability of the steam generation system thus achieved, was the extensive changes now required to the locomotive frame.|$|R

50|$|For {{economic}} reasons the general repair programme was cut back, nevertheless {{in early summer}} 1960 work began on the reconstruction of Class 52 at RAW Stendal. Up to 1967, 200 locomotives were rebuilt with a slightly modified, Typ 50E, combustion-chambered boiler, originally designed for the Class 50.35. Other notable features of the Rekolok were new, <b>welded</b> <b>cylinders,</b> an IfS/DR mixer-preheater system and a new driver's cab front walls with oval windows, mainly {{on account of the}} new boiler. The intention to replace the entire the cab and provide the engines with new tenders did not come about. The worn out Class 2'2'T30 tub tenders were mainly given new tubs.|$|R

50|$|As {{part of this}} rebuild, {{the engines}} were given welded driver's cabs, newly {{designed}} boilers (the Rekokessel) with combustion chambers, mixer-preheater systems, new <b>welded</b> <b>cylinders,</b> Trofimoff valves and Witte smoke deflectors. The reinforced Type 58E Rekokessel was a slightly modified Type 50E boiler, that was also installed on e.g. the Rekoloks of Class 50.35 and Class 52.80 {{as well as the}} DR Neubaulok, the DR Class 23.10. Due to the longer boiler, the frame also had to be extended. The distance between the carrying axle wheelset and the first coupled axle increased by around 300 mm and the overall wheelbase of the locomotive from 8,500 to 8,800 mm. That and other changes meant that the permitted top speed could be raised from 65 km/h to 70 km/h.|$|R

50|$|The new boiler {{made the}} {{so-called}} Reko-01 (Reko {{is short for}} Rekolokomotive) into the most powerful German express train steam locomotive. In addition to a combustion chamber and the well-known IfS mixer-preheater, the 01.5's boiler was fitted with three full bore boiler safety valves (Ackermann valves, nominal width 60). The engines were given Trofimoff valves and, apart from 01 501 and 01 520, new <b>welded</b> <b>cylinders.</b> The new boiler came with a new, welded driver's cab with upholstered seats, side-pull regulator and other improvements to the working conditions of the locomotive crew, {{as well as an}} Indusi system. The latter was required for the border-crossing traffic to Bebra and Hamburg-Altona and services on the Dresden-Berlin line. Because the coupled wheelsets on many engines had to be replaced due to fractured spokes, eight examples were fitted with Boxpok wheels made of cast iron, like those already used in the Soviet Union and the United States. These did not prove themselves, however, due to manufacturing defects and were later swapped out for spoked wheels from retired 01s. In order to hide the ugly wheelsets, the Boxpok locomotives and several other vehicles were fitted with full skirts.|$|R

40|$|Transmission {{electron}} microscopy (TEM) {{was used to}} characterize the microstructures at and near the weld interface in upset welded Type 304 L stainless steel test samples. Two sample configurations were examined in this study; upset <b>welded</b> <b>cylinders</b> prepared using a commercial resistance welder and cylindrical shaped samples welded in a Gleeble 1500 thermomechanical simulation device. The Gleeble samples evaluated were welded at 800 C, 900 C and 1, 200 C with a 0. 5 cm weld upset. The base microstructure of the samples varied with weld temperature. The lower temperature specimens contained a large free-dislocation density and distinct dislocation cells. The higher temperature specimens contained well-developed subgrains and a much lower free-dislocation density. The microstructure of the upset welded samples most closely resembled the 1, 200 C Gleeble sample. No distinct bond line was observed by TEM {{in any of the}} specimens, i. e., diffusion and grain growth occurred across all weld interfaces. However, weld interfaces in both specimen configurations were characterized by the presence of 50 [...] 300 nm diameter particles spaced between 300 and 1, 300 nm apart. Through the use of electron diffraction analysis and X-ray microanalysis two precipitate types were identified in both specimen configurations. A crystalline phase very similar to Mn{sub 1. 5 }Cr{sub 1. 5 }O{sub 4 } and an amorphous phase enriched mainly in Si and Al were observed.

40|$|Full scale {{assembly}} welding of Ares I Upper Stage 5. 5 -Meter diameter {{cryogenic tank}} barrel segments has been {{performed at the}} Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). One full-scale developmental article produced under the Ares 1 Upper Stage project is the Manufacturing Demonstration Article (MDA) Barrel. This presentation {{will focus on the}} welded assembly of this barrel section, and associated lessons learned. Among the MDA articles planned on the Ares 1 Program, the Barrel was the first to be completed, primarily because the process of manufacture from piece parts (barrel panels) utilized the most mature friction stir process planned for use on the Ares US program: Conventional fixed pin Friction Stir Welding (FSW). This process is in use on other space launch systems, including the Shuttle s External Tank, the Delta IV common booster core, the Delta II, and the Atlas V rockets. The goals for the MDA Barrel development were several fold: 1) to prove out Marshall Space Flight Center s new Vertical Weld Tool for use in manufacture of cylindrical barrel sections, 2) to serve as a first run for weld qualification to a new weld specification, and 3) to provide a full size cylindrical section for downstream use in precision cleaning and Spray-on Foam Insulation development. The progression leading into the welding of the full size barrel included sub scale panel <b>welding,</b> subscale <b>cylinder</b> <b>welding,</b> a full length confidence weld, and finally, the 3 seamed MDA barrel processing.

5|$|As the Mary Rose {{was built}} and served {{during a period}} of rapid {{development}} of heavy artillery, her armament was a mix of old designs and innovations. The heavy armament was a mix of older-type wrought iron and cast bronze guns, which differed considerably in size, range and design. The large iron guns were made up of staves or bars <b>welded</b> into <b>cylinders</b> and then reinforced by shrinking iron hoops and breech loaded, from the back, and equipped with simpler gun-carriages made from hollowed-out elm logs with only one pair of wheels, or without wheels entirely. The bronze guns were cast in one piece and rested on four-wheel carriages which were essentially the same as those used until the 19th century. The breech-loaders were cheaper to produce and both easier and faster to reload, but could take less powerful charges than cast bronze guns. Generally, the bronze guns used cast iron shot and were more suited to penetrate hull sides while the iron guns used stone shot that would shatter on impact and leave large, jagged holes, but both could also fire a variety of ammunition intended to destroy rigging and light structure or injure enemy personnel.|$|R
