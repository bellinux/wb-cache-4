5|$|First {{elected to}} Congress in 1936, Voorhis had {{defeated}} lackluster Republican opposition {{four times in}} the then-rural Los Angeles County district to win re-election. For the 1946 election, Republicans sought a candidate who could unite the party and run a strong race against Voorhis in the Republican-leaning district. After failing to secure the candidacy of General George Patton, in November 1945 they settled on Lieutenant Commander Richard Nixon, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the district prior to his World War II service.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all {{structures}} {{within an}} 800-metre (half-mile) radius, including {{the entire community}} of Richmond, were obliterated. A pressure wave snapped trees, bent iron rails, demolished buildings, grounded vessels, and scattered fragments of Mont-Blanc for kilometres. Hardly a window in the city proper survived the blast. Across the harbour, in Dartmouth, there was also widespread damage. A tsunami created by the blast wiped out the community of Mi'kmaq First Nations people <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the Tufts Cove area for generations.|$|E

5|$|The {{composition}} of the scene is a pastiche of the frontispiece of Andreas Vesalius's De humani corporis fabrica, and it possibly also borrows from Quack Physicians' Hall (c. 1730) by the Dutch artist Egbert van Heemskerck, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> England and whose work Hogarth admired. An earlier source of inspiration {{may have been a}} woodcut in the 1495 Fasciculo di medicina by Johannes de Ketham which, although simpler, has many of the same elements, including the seated president flanked by two windows.|$|E
5|$|The {{death in}} 1986 of {{her younger sister}} Felicité, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> {{the top floor of}} her house for thirty years, was a severe blow to David. She began to suffer from {{depression}} and went to the doctor after suffering chest pains; he diagnosed tuberculosis and she was hospitalised. After a torrid time over a three-month stay in hospital, where the drugs she was prescribed had side-effects that affected her clarity of thinking, her friend, the wine importer and writer Gerald Asher, arranged for her to stay with him in California to recuperate.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{not fully}} {{understood}} how it came to his attention, Rochdale Town Hall was admired by Adolf Hitler. It has been suggested a visit by Hitler in 1912–13 while staying with his half-brother Alois Hitler, Jr. in Liverpool, or military intelligence on Rochdale, or information from Nazi sympathiser William Joyce (<b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Oldham), brought the building to his attention. Hitler admired the architecture {{so much that it}} is believed he wished to ship the building, brick-by-brick, to Nazi Germany had German-occupied Europe encompassed the United Kingdom. Rochdale was broadly avoided by German bombers during the Second World War.|$|E

5|$|Chinese {{historians have}} long debated whether Hanpu was of Silla, Goryeo, or Jurchen ethnicity. Since the 1980s, they have chiefly {{argued that he}} was a Jurchen <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Silla, the state that had {{dominated}} the Korean peninsula until it was destroyed by Goryeo in 935. Western scholars usually treat Hanpu's story as a legend, but agree that it hints to contacts between some Jurchen clans and the states of Goryeo and Balhae (a state located between Jurchen lands and Silla until it was destroyed in 926) in the early tenth century. In Korea, a recent KBS history special treated Hanpu as a native Silla man who moved north and settled in Jurchen lands during the demise of Silla.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the same}} time gay men were getting sick in the U.S., doctors in Paris, France, were {{receiving}} patients who were African or <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Africa with the same symptoms as Americans. Parisian researchers Jean-Claude Chermann, Françoise Barre, Luc Montagnier, and doctor Willy Rozenbaum began taking biopsies of HIV-infected lymph nodes and discovered a new retrovirus. As a scientific necessity {{to compare it to}} the American version of HIV, French doctors representing the Pasteur Institute sent a colleague to the National Cancer Institute, where Robert Gallo was also working on the virus. The colleague switched the samples, Shilts reported, because of a grudge he had against the Pasteur Institute. Instead of Gallo comparing his samples with the French samples, he found the very same retrovirus as the French sample, putting back any new results in AIDS research for at least a year.|$|E
5|$|From 1927, Lee was {{actively}} {{involved with the}} SCCCI, initially as General-Secretary, then as President. Under his leadership, the SCCCI supported the establishment of Nanyang University and convinced the British to grant citizenship to Chinese immigrants <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Singapore for eight years. Lee was Chairman of the Ee Hoe Hean Club from 1933–1935 and 1941–1945. Lee {{was also one of}} six Hokkien representatives in the Overseas Chinese Association (OCA), which acted as a bridge between the Chinese community and Japanese military administration during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. During an OCA assignment to the Endau Settlement in Malaysia, his convoy was ambushed by the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army and everyone in the convoy was shot. Only Lee survived, as a bullet hit a Buddhist medallion on his chest; this inspired him to spread Buddhism in Singapore.|$|E

5|$|On March 21, 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court {{handed down}} its ruling {{in the case}} of Dunn v. Blumstein that found that a citizen <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> a state for 30 days was {{resident}} in that state and thus eligible to vote there. Kentucky's Constitution required residency of one year in the state, six months in the county and sixty days in the precinct to establish voting eligibility. This issue had to be resolved before the 1972 presidential election in November, so Ford called a special legislative session to enact the necessary corrections. In addition, Ford added to the General Assembly's agenda the creation of a state environmental protection agency, a refinement of congressional districts in line with the latest census figures and ratification of the recently passed Equal Rights Amendment. All of these measures passed.|$|E
5|$|The {{cardinals}} who {{had turned}} against Pope Urban VI elected a new pope, Clement VII on 20 September 1378, which {{gave rise to the}} Western Schism. Louis acknowledged Urban VI as the legitimate pope and offered him support to fight against his opponents in Italy. As Joanna I of Naples decided to join Clement VII's camp, Pope Urban excommunicated and dethroned her on 17 June 1380. The pope acknowledged Charles of Durazzo, <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Louis's court, as the lawful king of Naples. After Charles of Durazzo promised that he would not claim Hungary against Louis's daughters, Louis dispatched him to invade Southern Italy {{at the head of a}} large army. Within a year, Charles of Durazzo occupied the Kingdom of Naples, and forced Queen Joanna to surrender to him on 26 August 1381.|$|E
5|$|Huggins {{set up a}} Defence Committee {{within the}} Cabinet to {{co-ordinate}} the colony's war effort in early 1940. This body comprised the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister Jacob Smit, Tredgold and Lieutenant-Colonel Ernest Lucas Guest, the Minister of Mines and Public Works, who {{was put in charge}} of the new Air Ministry. About 1,600 of the colony's whites were serving overseas by May 1940 when, during the Battle of France, Salisbury passed legislation allowing the authorities to call up any male British subject of European ancestry aged between 19 and a half and 25 <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> the colony for at least six months. The minimum age was reduced to 18 in 1942. Part-time training was compulsory for all white males between 18 and 55, with a small number of exceptions for those in reserved occupations. On 25 May 1940 Southern Rhodesia, the last country to join the EATS, became the first to start operating an air school under it, beating Canada by a week. The SRAF was absorbed into the British Royal Air Force (RAF) in April 1940, with No.1 Squadron becoming No. 237 (Rhodesia) Squadron RAF. The RAF subsequently designated two more Rhodesian squadrons, namely No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron (in 1940) and No. 44 (Rhodesia) Squadron (1941), {{in a manner similar to}} the Article XV squadrons from Australia, Canada and New Zealand.|$|E

5|$|Princess Zita of Bourbon-Parma {{was born}} at the Villa Pianore in the Italian Province of Lucca, 9 May 1892. The unusual name Zita was given her after a popular Italian Saint <b>who</b> <b>had</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> Tuscany in the 13th century. She was the third {{daughter}} and fifth child of the deposed Robert I, Duke of Parma and his second wife Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, a daughter of King Miguel of Portugal and his wife Princess Adelaide of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. Zita's father had lost his throne {{as a result of}} the movement for Italian unification in 1859 when he was still a child. He fathered twelve children during his first marriage to Princess Maria Pia of the Two Sicilies (six of whom were mentally disabled, and three of whom died young). Duke Robert became a widower in 1882, and two years later he married Infanta Maria Antonia of Portugal, Zita's mother. The second marriage produced a further twelve children. Zita was the 17th child among Duke Robert's 24 children. Robert moved his large family between Villa Pianore (a large property located between Pietrasanta and Viareggio) and his castle in Schwarzau in lower Austria. It was mainly in these two residences that Zita spent her formative years. The family spent most of the year in Austria moving to Pianore in the Winter and returning in the Summer. To move between them, they took a special train with sixteen coaches to accommodate the family and their belongings.|$|E
