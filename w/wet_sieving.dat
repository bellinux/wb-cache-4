50|$|The {{particle}} size distribution of a soil sample may indicate {{the conditions under which}} the strata or sediment were deposited.

The soil samples were pre-wetted slowly to matric suction of 200 kPa before the <b>wet</b> <b>sieving.</b> The pre-wetted samples were wet-sieved for 5, 10 and 15 min in order to simulate different hydro-mechanical stresses imposed on soil structure. Tensile strength of soil aggregates were also measured at air-dry and 500 kPa matric suction conditions. Short duration shaking (i. e. 5 min) could effectively discriminate the Hamedan soils in terms of structural stability due to their fairly low aggregate stabilities. The soil organic matter content had the highest impact on MWD followed by both clay and CaCO 3 content. The same was true for the Y values i. e.
