5|$|Christian pilgrim and archdeacon Theodosius (518–520) in his De situ terrae sanctae {{mentions}} that 'close to Jacob's <b>Well</b> <b>are</b> {{the remains of}} Joseph the Holy'. The Madaba Mosaic Map (6th century) designates a site somewhat problematically with the legend – 'Joseph's' (τὸ τοῦ Ὶωσήφ) – where the usual adjective 'holy' (hagios) accompanying mentions of saints and their shrines is lacking.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is divided}} into six environments, each {{representing}} a different setting from the film. To accomplish {{the objective of the}} game, the player must guide E.T. into the wells. Once all items found in a <b>well</b> <b>are</b> collected, the player must levitate E.T. out of them. An icon at the top of each screen represents the current area, each area enabling the player to perform different actions. Antagonists include a scientist who takes E.T. for observation and an FBI agent who chases the alien to confiscate one of the collected telephone pieces, or candy. The game offers diverse difficulty settings that affect the number and speed of humans present, and the conditions needed to accomplish the objective.|$|E
5|$|The habitat {{includes}} {{various kinds}} of wetlands, such as lakes, marshes, and rivers. Oryzomys species swim <b>well,</b> <b>are</b> active during the night, and eat both plant and animal food. They build woven nests of vegetation. After a gestation period of 21 to 28days, about four young are born. Species of Oryzomys are infected by numerous parasites and carry at least three hantaviruses, one of which (Bayou virus) also infects humans. Two, maybe three, species have gone extinct {{over the last two}} centuries and at least one other is endangered, but the widespread marsh rice rat and O.couesi are not threatened.|$|E
50|$|Artificial {{recharge}} of floodwater using injection <b>wells</b> <b>was</b> {{first developed}} in the Federal District around 1953. Half of the <b>wells</b> <b>were</b> subsequently closed due to operational problems. In 1970, a series of approximately 56 <b>wells</b> <b>was</b> developed {{for the purposes of}} disposing of stormwater. These <b>wells</b> <b>were</b> capable of handling up to 35 m3/s of water collectively. Although the <b>wells</b> <b>were</b> not designed for recharge purposes, the storm water possibly reached the aquifer.|$|R

5|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} is {{relatively}} small and usually originates behind the free rear tip of the pectoral fins. No ridge exists {{between the first and}} second dorsal fins. The pectoral fins are moderately short, narrow, and falcate (sickle-shaped). The body is densely covered with diamond-shaped dermal denticles with seven (rarely five) shallow horizontal ridges. The coloration is gray above, sometimes with a bronze sheen, and white below, with a faint white band on the sides. Young individuals have unmarked fins; the tips of the second dorsal fin, pectoral fins, anal fin, and lower caudal fin lobe (and sometimes the other fins, as <b>well)</b> <b>are</b> black in larger individuals. The spinner shark differs from the blacktip shark in that its first dorsal fin is slightly more triangular in shape and is placed further back on the body. Adults can also be distinguished by the black tip on the anal fin.|$|E
25|$|The Bhagavad Gita is a {{dialogue}} where Krishna speaks to Arjuna {{of the role}} of a guru, and similarly emphasizes in verse 4.34 that those who know their subject <b>well</b> <b>are</b> eager for good students, and the student can learn from such a guru through reverence, service, effort and the process of inquiry.|$|E

Notable as <b>well</b> <b>are</b> the lives of Amadou Bamba and El Hadj Umar Tall in West Africa, and Sheikh Mansur and Imam Shamil in the Caucasus. In the twentieth century, some Muslims have called Sufism a superstitious religion that holds back Islamic achievement {{in the fields of}} science and technology.|$|E

25|$|A {{small number}} of species support the {{majority}} of the world's fisheries. Some of these species are herring, cod, anchovy, tuna, flounder, mullet, squid, shrimp, salmon, crab, lobster, oyster and scallops. All except these last four provided a worldwide catch of well over a million tonnes in 1999, with herring and sardines together providing a catch of over 22 million metric tons in 1999. Many other species as <b>well</b> <b>are</b> fished in smaller numbers.|$|E
25|$|Hunters have meticulous turnout {{and tend}} toward very quiet, {{conservative}} horse tack and rider attire. Hunter bits, bridles, crops, spurs, and martingales are tightly regulated. Jumpers, while {{caring for their}} horses and grooming them <b>well,</b> <b>are</b> not scored on turnout, are allowed {{a wider range of}} equipment, and may wear less conservative attire, so long as it stays within the rules. Formal turnout always is preferred; a neat rider gives a good impression at shows.|$|E
25|$|The city's {{significant}} {{minority of}} Chinese, mostly Cantonese ancestors, {{were brought in}} the mid-19th century by Spanish settlers via the Philippines with work contracts and after completing 8-year contracts many Chinese immigrants settled permanently in Havana. Before the revolution the Chinese population counted to over 200,000, today, Chinese ancestors could count up to 100,000. Chinese born/ native Chinese (mostly Cantonese as <b>well)</b> <b>are</b> around 400 presently. There are some 3,000 Russians living in the city; {{as reported by the}} Russian Embassy in Havana, most are women married to Cubans who had studied in the Soviet Union. Havana also shelters other non-Cuban population of an unknown size. There is a population of several thousand North African teen and pre-teen refugees.|$|E

500|$|Just a short {{distance}} from the Chalice Well site, across a road known as Well House Lane, can be found the [...] "White Spring", where a temple has been created in the 21st century.

Both springs rise from caverns underneath the Tor and it is claimed that both have healing in their flow.|$|E
500|$|St Ceinwen's Church, Cerrigceinwen, is {{a former}} parish church in the {{countryside}} of central Anglesey, north Wales. The present building dates from 1860, although the site {{has been used for}} worship since at least the 7th century. [...] The doorway reuses some old carved gravestones, one from the 9th to 11th centuries, and another from the 12th century.

But before Elvis was camp, he was its opposite: a genuine cultural force.... Elvis's breakthroughs are underappreciated because in this rock-and-roll age, his hard-rocking music and sultry style have triumphed so completely."

500|$|In October 1956 Mikoyan {{was sent}} to the People's Republic of Hungary to gather {{information}} on the developing crisis caused by the revolution against the communist government there. Together with Mikhail Suslov, Mikoyan traveled to Budapest in an armored personnel carrier, in view of the shooting in the streets. He sent a telegram to Moscow reporting his impressions of the situation. [...] "We had the impression that Ernő Gerő especially, but the other comrades as <b>well,</b> <b>are</b> exaggerating the strength of the opponent and underestimating their own strength," [...] he and Suslov wrote. Mikoyan strongly opposed the decision by Khrushchev and the Politburo to use Soviet troops, believing it would destroy the Soviet Union's international reputation, instead arguing for the application of [...] "military intimidation" [...] and economic pressure. The crushing of the revolution by Soviet forces nearly led to Mikoyan's resignation.|$|E
500|$|In March 1941, Vasey was {{promoted}} to temporary brigadier and took command of the 6th Division's 19th Infantry Brigade following the departure of Horace Robertson to Australia on medical grounds. He led it in Greece, suffering a defeat at the Battle of Vevi. Vasey's instructions to his men were couched in typical Vasey terms: [...] "Here you bloody <b>well</b> <b>are</b> and here you bloody well stay. And if any bloody German gets between your post and the next, turn your bloody bren around and shoot him up the arse." [...] The 19th Infantry Brigade was evacuated to Crete, where it fought in the Battle of Crete. Vasey was commended {{for his work in}} Crete and was among the last to be evacuated to Egypt, but some 3,000 Australians were taken prisoner. Although it was a bitter defeat, Vasey's performance was considered outstanding; he was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), awarded a Bar to his DSO, and later the Greek War Cross.|$|E
