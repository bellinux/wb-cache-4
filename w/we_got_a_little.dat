500|$|Some People Change was Montgomery Gentry's lowest-selling album at the time. Joe Galante, then-president of Sony Music Nashville, {{thought that}} the album's poor sales were because it [...] "strayed musically from what the base had been. They have an edge to their sound, and I think <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too soft." [...] Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times gave a mixed review, {{saying that it was}} more [...] "touchy-feely" [...] than You Do Your Thing, and that [...] "no one works a snarling country chorus like Montgomery Gentry". Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a [...] "C", criticizing the duo for the {{contradictory}} viewpoints of personal changes on the title track versus the [...] "defense of the American right to piss off your neighbors" [...] in [...] "What Do Ya Think About That". Jurek comparatively called it a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and said that it was [...] "a new pinnacle for the duo", calling the title track [...] "one of those tunes that defines something that {{lies at the heart of}} what is good about Americans." ...|$|E
500|$|... "You're Not Sorry" [...] {{received}} moderately positive {{reviews from}} critics. Rob Sheffield of Blender magazine received [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] negatively {{and used the}} word [...] "drippy" [...] to describe it. Sheffield added that, in the song, by comparison, [...] "she reminds you what a smart job she normally does of keeping the tempo jumping." [...] Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine believed [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] {{was one of the}} songs on Fearless that expanded on the success of Swift's eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift (2006), because of how prominently its hook stands out. Craig Rosen of The Hollywood Reporter said [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] was ostentatious in regards to Swift's crossover potential. Nick Catucci of New York magazine read an article posted in The New York Times, which stated Swift [...] "quickly established herself as the most remarkable country music breakthrough artist of the decade", and opted his own opinion, based on the song. Catucci said, [...] "And indeed, we think <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> fairy dust in our eyes listening to 'You're Not Sorry' [...] isn't the stuff of redneck women but earnest suburban princesses," [...] despite that he had listened to better songs in the past decade. Scott Mervis of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette compared [...] "You're Not Sorry" [...] to a [...] "chanteuse a la Tori Amos".|$|E
500|$|Disillusioned {{at being}} typecast as the [...] "sarcastic {{interest}} of the guy", Stone co-starred with Viola Davis in Tate Taylor's period drama The Help (2011), a film she found to be challenging. The film is based on Kathryn Stockett's 2009 novel {{of the same name}} and is set in 1960s Jackson, Mississippi. She met with Taylor to express a desire to work in the film. Taylor has said: [...] "Emma was completely awkward and dorky, with her raspy voice, and she sat down and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> intoxicated and had a blast, and I just thought, 'God! God! This is Skeeter." [...] She was cast as Eugenia [...] "Skeeter" [...] Phelan, an aspiring writer learning about the lives of the African-American maids. In preparation for the part, she trained to speak in a Southern dialect; she also educated herself on the Civil Rights Movement through literature and film. With a worldwide gross of $216 million against a budget of $25 million, The Help became Stone's most commercially successful film to that point. The film, and her performance, received positive reviews from critics. Writing for Empire, Anna Smith thought that Stone was [...] "well-meaning and hugely likable" [...] despite finding flaws in the character. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture, and won Best Ensemble Cast from the Women Film Critics Circle and the Broadcast Film Critics Association.|$|E
60|$|The {{musician}} betrayed impatience at {{the name}} of Beethoven, and thought, with his mouth appreciatively full of salted almonds, that nowadays <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> beyond that anyhow.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Owen, more {{confused}} than before. [...] "Yes--I see; we couldn't do wrong, I suppose--could we?--if <b>we</b> <b>got</b> her <b>a</b> <b>little</b> dog, and <b>a</b> {{lot of new}} gowns." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I don't know. I guess I must one o' these days. I've kind o' be'n waitin' till <b>we</b> <b>got</b> into <b>a</b> <b>little</b> better shape. I hate {{to go back}} poor." ...|$|R
6000|$|It was as he surmised {{about the}} cliff. When <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> on our [...] way we saw how the rocky {{formation}} trended to our right, till, [...] finally, {{with a wide}} curve, it came round to the other side.|$|E
6000|$|CLEOPATRA. Yes: {{the sacred}} white cat: {{is it not}} dreadful? I brought him here to {{sacrifice}} him to the Sphinx; but when <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> way from the city a black cat called him, and he jumped out of my arms and ran away to it. Do {{you think that the}} black cat can have been my great-great-great-grandmother? ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{ten o'clock}} at night {{when we got to}} Domo d'Ossola, {{at the foot of the}} Pass of the Simplon. But as the moon was shining brightly, and there was not a cloud in the starlit sky, it was no time for going to bed, or going {{anywhere}} but on. So, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> carriage, after some delay, and began the ascent.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's no use wishing," [...] James replied. [...] "We can't risk {{anything}} of that sort and, probably, all the farm houses are full of troops. <b>We</b> have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bread left. That will hold us over tomorrow comfortably." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We <b>got</b> <b>a</b> meal, too, {{soon after}} we landed," [...] Geoffrey said; [...] "but {{we did not}} dry our clothes till <b>we</b> <b>got</b> to <b>a</b> <b>little</b> village. I did not ask its name. I am awfully sorry, Joe, about the Susan." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> of everything," [...] she said. [...] "As pretty sashes {{as there}} are in the country, {{beautiful}} silk neckerchiefs, silver brooches for your sweethearts, and for those who purchase freely a glass of the best pisco spirit." ...|$|R
60|$|At Rotterdam, <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> money, with liberty. When he {{last was}} up, I asked for more, {{and the captain}} refused it. This brought on an explosion, and I swore I would quit the ship. After a time, the captain consented, {{as well as he}} could, leaving my wages on the cabin-table, where I found them, and telling me I should repent of what I was then doing. Little did I then think he would prove so true a prophet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well, it's all chance, {{say what}} we will about it. Here have I journeyed and guided through the woods female after female, and consorted {{with them in the}} garrisons, and never have I even felt an {{inclination}} for any, until I saw Mabel Dunham. It's true the poor Sergeant first set me to thinking about his daughter; but after <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> acquainted like, I'd no need of being spoken to, to think of her night and day. I'm tough, Jasper; yes, I'm very tough; and I'm risolute enough, as you all know; and yet I do think it would quite break me down, now, to lose Mabel Dunham!" ...|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} one melancholy part. In the mouth of Loch Aline we found a great sea-going ship at anchor; and this I {{supposed}} at first {{to be one of}} the King's cruisers which were kept along that coast, both summer and winter, to prevent communication with the French. As <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> nearer, it became plain she was a ship of merchandise; and what still more puzzled me, not only her decks, but the sea-beach also, were quite black with people, and skiffs were continually plying to and fro between them. Yet nearer, and there began to come to our ears a great sound of mourning, the people on board and those on the shore crying and lamenting one to another so as to pierce the heart.|$|E
60|$|He {{flung the}} door open as he spoke, and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> out, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> dazzled and stupefied (at least I felt so) at the sudden {{transition}} from the half-darkness of the railway-carriage to the brilliantly-lighted platform of Elveston Station.|$|R
5000|$|American rap {{rock group}} Gym Class Heroes {{references}} Ruffin in the 2008 song [...] "Like Father, Like Son (Papa's Song)" [...] from their album The Quilt stating: [...] "I never understood temptation.

5000|$|Matt Kenseth, who {{qualified}} second, {{said that}} the [...] "Toyota's {{had a lot of}} speed in them" [...] and that he [...] "couldn’t get that last lap I wanted. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> off-balance <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit at the end. Martin was able to get it. We came up <b>a</b> <b>little</b> short.” ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sleep. But {{after all}} we had gone through, our {{activities}} were not over for the night; for about {{two o'clock in the}} morning we heard a shout of warning from down the lane, accompanied by a chorus from all the dogs, and in a moment everybody was up and flying around {{to find out what the}} alarm was about. The alarmist was a horseman who gave notice that a detachment of Union soldiers was on its way from Hannibal with orders to capture and hang any bands like ours which it could find, and said we had no time to lose. Farmer Mason was in a flurry this time, himself. He hurried us out of the house with all haste, and sent one of his negroes with us to show us where to hide ourselves and our tell-tale guns among the ravines half a mile away. It was raining heavily.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Jackson {{seemed a}} little disappointed, but she {{smoothed}} the dress over her sharp knees, and continued: [...] "Right there {{the good old days}} ended for yore ma--and for us. The cattle business has been steadily on the chute--that is, the free-range business. I saw it comin', an' I says to Jackson, 'Camp on some river-bottom and chuck in the alfalfy,' I says. An' that's what we did. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bunch o' cattle up in the park--Uncle Sam's man is lookin' after 'em." [...] She grinned. [...] "Jackson kicked at the fee, but I says: 'Twenty cents a head is cheap pasture. We're lucky to get any grass at all, now that everybody's goin' in for sheep. 'Pears like the sheepmen air gettin' bolder and bolder in this free-range graft, and I'm a-bettin' on trouble.'" [...] She rose. [...] "Well, I'm glad to 've had a word with ye; but you hear me: yore ma has got to have doctor's help, or she's a-goin' to fall down some day soon." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was just}} noon when we cast {{off from the}} wreck, and stood {{directly}} off the land. According to our calculations, the wind enabled us to run, with a clean full, on our true course. As the boats drew out into the ocean, we had abundant opportunities of discovering how many dangers we had escaped; and, for my own part, I felt deeply grateful, even then, as I was going out upon the wide Atlantic in a mere shell of a boat, at the mercy we had experienced. No sooner were we fairly in deep water, than the captain and mate had a dialogue {{on the subject of}} the currents again. Notwithstanding all the difficulties his old theory had brought him into, the former remained of opinion that the true current set to windward, and that we should so find it as soon as <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> into the offing; while the mate was frank enough to say he had been of opinion, all along, that it ran the other way. The latter added that Bourbon was rather a small spot to steer for, and it might be better to get into its longitude, and then find it by meridian observations, than to make any more speculations about matters of which we knew nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is, Deerslayer," [...] {{answered}} Judith, almost inaudibly. [...] "That duty {{has just}} been performed. You are right in thinking that I wish to consult a friend; and that friend is yourself. Hurry Harry is about to leave us; when he is gone, and <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over the feelings of this solemn office, I hope you will give me an hour alone. Hetty and I are at a loss what to do." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{character}} {{would ensure}} him {{a situation in}} the establishment of patient Griselda. The servant has come for the little Browns this morning--they have been a toothache to me which I shall enjoy the riddance of--Their little voices are like wasps' stings--Sometimes am I all wound with Browns.[97] We had a claret feast some little while ago. There were Dilke, Reynolds, Skinner, Mancur, John Brown, Martin, Brown and I. <b>We</b> all <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tipsy--but pleasantly so--I enjoy Claret to a degree.|$|R
5000|$|Well, it {{was kind}} of odd. We turned in a {{proposal}} to Fox, just because it was something I had always wanted to do. I can't remember how long ago, and we didn't hear-- I guess <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> nice <b>little</b> 'thank you' note or something-- and we said, 'Okay, that's that,' and just kind of forgot about it. And then one day, out of the blue, Fox came to us and said, 'Hey! You know, we really liked what you guys did-- and we were wondering if you'd be interested in having a license?' ...|$|R
60|$|Two {{days were}} spent here, {{but the place}} was {{unproductive}} of insects or birds of interest, so we made another attempt to get on. As soon as <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> away from the land we had a fair wind, and in six hours' sailing reached {{the entrance of the}} Watelai channel, which divides the most northerly from the middle portion of Aru. At its mouth this was about half a mile wide, but soon narrowed, and a mile or two on it assumed entirely the aspect of a river about the width of the Thames at London, winding among low but undulating and often hilly country. The scene was exactly such as might be expected in the interior of a continent. The channel continued of a uniform average width, with reaches and sinuous bends, one bank being often precipitous, or even forming vertical cliffs, while the other was flat and apparently alluvial; and it was only the pure salt-water, and the absence of any stream but the slight flux and reflux of the tide, that would enable a person to tell that he was navigating a strait and not a river. The wind was fair, and carried us along, with occasional assistance from our oars, till about three in the afternoon, when we landed where a little brook formed two or three basins in the coral rock, and then fell in a miniature cascade into the salt water river. Here we bathed and cooked our dinner, and enjoyed ourselves lazily till sunset, when we pursued our way for two hours snore, and then moored our little vessel to an overhanging tree for the night.|$|E
5000|$|Sony BMG Nashville {{chairman}} Joe Galante {{thought that}} the duo and the label [...] "strayed musically from what the base had been. They have an edge to their sound, and I think <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too soft." ...|$|E
5000|$|When {{asked about}} the band's musical direction, Sugar stated [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more {{progressive}} since the debut, more complex. The new music is so much darker and more aggressive, and that's really not due to any choice in direction -- it's just the result of our attitudes as people." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Barclay's eyes twinkled. [...] "As a rule, it's {{difficult}} to hustle the Government of the United States, and I'm {{inclined to think}} the same thing applies {{to that of other}} countries. However, as I said, <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> ahead <b>a</b> <b>little</b> at the other end. For example, we have a tolerably accurate notion where the dope goes." ...|$|R
50|$|All {{along this}} crest went a snakelike long crevasse, {{for which we}} had {{continually}} to sound, and go first one side and then the other; then <b>we</b> <b>got</b> {{to the foot of}} the saddle. Some twenty or thirty steps, some cut, some uncut, soon took us up a kind of hollow, and <b>we</b> <b>got</b> on <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sloping plateau of some six feet large, where we left the grub and the knapsack, keeping my small flask of cognac only. Then up a steep ice slope, very steep I should say, down which the bits of ice cut out of the steps hopped and jumped at full gallop and then bounded over to some bottomless place which we could not see down. Their pace gave one an unpleasant idea of the possible consequence of a slip.|$|R
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>got</b> out at <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{town called}} Struan, {{and then we}} took a {{carriage}} and drove across the wild moors and hills for thirteen miles till we came to this village {{at the end of}} Loch Rannoch. The wind blew strong and sharp, but we knew what we had to expect, and had warm clothes on. And with the cool breeze, and remembering [...] "Scots wha ha' wi' Wallace bled," [...] it made my blood tingle all the way.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{had a good}} time... I was in {{the studio}} with Scott Storch and we wanted to have a party record, a record that'd make you get up and dance.

5000|$|When {{asked about}} his {{motivation}} in opening a movie theater in the first place, [...] "What {{we set out to}} do in the very beginning was to make a movie theater by fans for fans.

5000|$|About this song, Dave {{speaks in}} his concert at Blue Note (Columbia, Mo - 22 October 1994): [...] "So one time, uh, so one time, I'm {{stuck in a}} room, in a little house, and we're kinda snowed in. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> fire burning and there's a girl with me, who's {{a good friend of}} mine, and we're all alone, and she's got a boyfriend, and I got a girlfriend, but then one thing leads to another, and next day we're all kinda uncomfortable. *Ahem.* So that's, this song's called Say Goodbye" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That we have, mother. Only {{think of}} the {{difference}} since we said good-by to each other last summer! Now here you are strong and well again, and we are together and don't mean to be separated, and I have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> place I like {{and have a good}} chance of getting on in, and <b>we</b> have <b>got</b> <b>a</b> pretty <b>little</b> house all to ourselves, and you will be able to live <b>a</b> <b>little</b> like <b>a</b> lady again,--I mean as you were accustomed to,--and everything is so nice. Oh, mother, I am sure we have every reason to be grateful!" ...|$|R
60|$|We had {{scarcely}} done so ere {{the first}} squall from behind struck us, and {{in five minutes}} we were running back {{as fast as we}} had come. The wind was at first south, but settled round to southeast. <b>We</b> <b>got</b> up <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more sail now, and made a shift to keep her to the west, for with this wind we should have been ashore long before morning if we had run straight before it. The sea had been heavy--it was tremendous now; and, light and seaworthy as the Jane was, we had to keep baling as the sea broke into her. Over and over again I thought that it was all over with us as the great waves towered above our stern, but they slipped under us as we went driving on at twelve or fourteen knots an hour. I stood up by the side of Jabez, and asked him what he thought of it.|$|R
60|$|We had not {{begun to}} have enough of Boston yet, and after dinner we went a long walk up the Witham, away from the parapet before the church, under which its deep tides are always washing to and fro. In the dimness, after <b>we</b> had <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> to the {{outskirts}} of the town, there seemed shipyards along the river's course, but at one place there was a large building brilliantly lighted, which from certain effects at the windows we decided to be a printing-office on the scale of those in and near our own Boston. What was our shame and grief the next morning to find it was a cigar factory, and to learn that cigar and cigarette making was almost the chief industry of the mother Boston. There are really two large tobacco factories there running overtime, and always advertising for more women and girls to do their work; and in our Boston, not so long ago, smoking in the street was forbidden! Such are the ironies of life.|$|R
