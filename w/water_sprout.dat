40|$|Stem or trunk {{girdling}} is {{a technique}} used in physiological studies and in horticultural practice for interrupting carbon flow through the phloem {{to other parts of}} the plant without influencing water flow in the xylem. Trunk girdling in peaches is practiced primarily to stimulate fruit growth but it also tends to decrease shoot vigour for a period of time after girdling. Water flow through the trunk or branches of peach trees is thought to be primarily dependent on the most recently formed ring of xylem and vegetative growth is closely related to stem water potential and stem hydraulic conductance. The aim of the present work was to determine whether vigour reduction due to girdling was correlated with a reduction in midday stem water potential during the period of time between girdling and the subsequent healing of stem tissue. 'Springcrest' peach trees were girdled on two different dates. Fruit yield and size, <b>water</b> <b>sprout</b> growth, proleptic shoot growth and stem water potential were measured. Early and late girdled trees yielded larger fruits and fewer and shorter water sprouts in comparison with control trees. Midday stem water potential declined significantly after girdling and gradually recovered until the time of fruit harvest. These results suggest that the vigour reduction of girdled trees is related to a decrease of midday stem water potential caused by girdling. Early tree girdling increased the reduction in midday stem water potential and shoot growth compared with the later girdling treatment. These results point out that even though girdling only removes bark and phloem tissue it can apparently affect water flow in xylem...|$|E

5000|$|Millwrights {{distinguished}} {{between the two}} forces, impulse and weight, at work in water wheels long before 18th-century Europe. Fitzherbert, a 16th-century agricultural writer, wrote [...] "druieth the wheel {{as well as with}} the weight of the water as with strengthe impulse". Leonardo da Vinci also discussed water power, noting [...] "the blow the water is not weight, but excites a power of weight, almost equal to its own power". However, even realisation of the two forces, weight and impulse, confusion remained over the advantages and disadvantages of the two, and there was no clear understanding of the superior efficiency of weight. Prior to 1750 it was unsure as to which force was dominant and was widely understood that both forces were operating with equal inspiration amongst one another. The waterwheel, sparked questions of the laws of nature, specifically the laws of force.

Cananga odorata is a tropical tree from the Annonaceae family, native of Indonesia. Only the forma genuina can be called ylang-ylang. Nowadays, it is mainly cultivated in the Indian Ocean Islands in order to extract the ylang-ylang essential oil for the cosmetic industry. Ylang-ylang develops on many types of soils, under high temperatures and average precipitations of 1, 500 mm per year. The pollarding, the maintenance, the elimination of <b>water</b> <b>sprouts</b> and the weeding must be performed to insure a high flower yield and facilitate harvesting. Flower harvest takes place all year long but flowers and essential oils yields are higher during the dry season.

40|$|Centrifugal pruning (CentP) was {{compared}} to conventional pruning (ConvP) {{over a five-year period}} beginning in 2004 with five-year-old peach trees, of the medium-maturing cultivar ‘Caprice’, under the conditions prevalent in the Middle Rhone Valley in France. CentP is a new training system for peach trees designed to improve light distribution in the canopy by creating a “light well” around the scaffold through early manual pruning. CentP tended to increase total soluble solids compared to ConvP, but the average fruit weight tended to decrease under CentP. Nevertheless, because of the increase in fruit yield, notably {{as a result of the}} greater number of flowers per shoot length, the relative profitability of fruit production was higher under CentP than under ConvP. Labour demand increased under CentP compared to ConvP, in the same proportion as monetary returns, so that the supplemental costs due to this innovative pruning method tended to be economically compensated for by increased fruit production. <b>Water</b> <b>sprouts</b> were removed in spring under CentP, instead of in summer under ConvP. Because summer is considered to be the busiest time of the year for fruit producers, CentP appears to be more advantageous in terms of work time management in the peach orchard than ConvP. Brown rot incidence tended to decrease at fruit maturity and until post-harvest storage under CentP compared to ConvP. This suggests that appropriate pruning practices possibly decrease peach disease sensitivity, which could lead to the reduced use of pesticide sprays to control brown rot in the orchard...|$|R
