30|$|That said, the {{unsupervised}} {{nature of}} the proposed method also raises some challenges. The cost function we use measures the success of reconstructing the original observed speech, but its relation to the dereverberation or room characteristics is indirect (see Fig. 3). Therefore, {{it is possible for}} the cost function to converge even when the method does not apply dereverberation. This also explains <b>why</b> <b>we</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> modify the iterative update rules to implement the NMFD model—our preliminary experiments conducted with and without initialization showed that the cost function converged, but the NMF dereverberation was not successful.|$|R

In the real business world, corporate decision-makers constantly ask the question: <b>why</b> do <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> invest in IT? Does it pay off? In this paper, we investigate how the stock market values a firm’s IT innovations {{in order to gain}} competitive advantage. In other words, we examine the role of IT innovations in the stock market valuation of a firm’s expected future cash flows. Our findings indicate that firms that are IT innovators are valued higher than their industry competitors. Clearly, IT innovations seem to pay off in the stock market. In this way, we show that learning I...|$|R
