40|$|Vehicle {{electrification}} through {{implementation of}} electric vehicles (EVs) with rechargeable batteries {{has the potential}} to significantly reduce the greenhouse gas emissions compared to a fleet of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). <b>Wireless</b> <b>charging,</b> as opposed to plug-in charging, is an alternative charging method for electric vehicles (EVs) with rechargeable batteries and can be applicable to EVs with fixed routes, such as transit buses. This thesis study adds to the current research of EV <b>wireless</b> <b>charging</b> by utilizing the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to provide a comprehensive framework for comparing the life cycle energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions associated with a stationary <b>wireless</b> <b>charging</b> all-electric bus system to a plug-in charging all-electric bus system. Life cycle inventory analysis of both plug-in and <b>wireless</b> <b>charging</b> hardware was conducted, and battery downsizing, vehicle lightweighting and use-phase energy consumption are modeled. A bus system in Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti area in Michigan is used as the basis for bus system modeling. Results show that the wirelessly charged battery can be downsized to 27 - 44 % of a plug-in charged battery. The associated reduction of 12 - 16 % in bus weight for the wireless buses can induce a reduction of 5. 4 - 7. 0 % in battery-to-wheel energy consumption. In the base case, the <b>wireless</b> <b>charging</b> system is comparable to the plug-in charging system in terms of life cycle energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. To further improve the energy and environmental performance of a <b>wireless</b> <b>charging</b> electric bus system, it is important to focus on key parameters including carbon intensity of the electric grid and <b>wireless</b> <b>charging</b> efficiency.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an initial investment cost analysis {{of public transportation}} systems operating with <b>wireless</b> <b>charging</b> electric vehicles (EVs). There are three different types of <b>wireless</b> <b>charging</b> systems, namely, stationary <b>wireless</b> <b>charging</b> (SWC), in which charging happens only when the vehicle is parked or idle, quasi-dynamic <b>wireless</b> <b>charging</b> (QWC), in which power is transferred when a vehicle is moving slowly or in stop-and-go mode, and dynamic <b>wireless</b> <b>charging</b> (DWC), in which power can be supplied even when the vehicle is in motion. This analysis compares the initial investment costs for these three types of charging systems for a wireless charging-based public transportation system. In particular, this analysis {{is focused on the}} energy logistics cost in transportation, which is defined as the cost of transferring and storing the energy needed to operate the transportation system. Performing this initial investment analysis is complicated, because it involves considerable tradeoffs between the costs of batteries in the EV fleet and different kinds of battery-charging infrastructure. Mathematical optimization models for each type of EV and infrastructure system are used to analyze the initial costs. The optimization methods evaluate the minimum initial investment needed to deploy the public transportation system for each type of EV charging solution. To deal with the variable cost estimates for batteries and infrastructure equipment in the current market, a cost-sensitivity analysis is performed. The goal of this analysis is to identify the market cost conditions that are most favorable for each type of <b>wireless</b> <b>charging</b> solution. Furthermore, the cost analysis quantitatively verifies the qualitative comparison of the three different <b>wireless</b> <b>charging</b> types conducted in the previous research...|$|R

As an alternative to conductive charging, wireless chargers provide a higher reliability to pollution and electric failures and they also extend the situations and places where the recharge could be available without user’s intervention (e. g. parking spaces, on-road). In order to optimize the performance of a <b>wireless</b> <b>charger,</b> its configuration should be dynamically adapted to the varying battery’s electrical features. Towards this goal, controllers are incorporated into the system to modify the behavior of some switching devices belonging to the power electronics blocks.

In this paper, we study a critical yet open problem for this application, i. e., the impact of <b>wireless</b> <b>charging</b> and mobility of EVs on the wholesale electricity market based on locational marginal price (LMP), which is mainly determined by the EV mobility patterns. To capture the dynamics in vehicle traffic flow and state of charge (SOC) of EV batteries, we model the EV mobility as a queueing network based on the statistics obtained via traffic information systems. Then, the load on each power system bus with respect to EV <b>wireless</b> <b>charging</b> is obtained using the stationary distribution of the queueing network. An economic dispatch problem is formulated to incorporate the EV <b>wireless</b> <b>charging</b> demand, and the LMP of each power system bus is obtained.
