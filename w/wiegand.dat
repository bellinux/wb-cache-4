5|$|After {{turning down}} offers from IBM and the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Segrè {{returned}} to Berkeley in 1952. He {{moved his family}} from Berkeley to nearby Lafayette, California, in 1955. Working with Chamberlain and others, he began searching for the antiproton, a subatomic antiparticle of the proton. The antiparticle of the electron, the positron had been predicted by Paul Dirac in 1931 and then discovered by Carl D. Anderson in 1932. By analogy, it was now expected {{that there would be}} an antiparticle corresponding to the proton, but no one had found one, and even in 1955 some scientists doubted that they existed. Using Lawrence's Bevatron set to 6GeV, they managed to detect conclusive evidence of antiprotons. Chamberlain and Segrè were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery. This was controversial, because Clyde <b>Wiegand</b> and Thomas Ypsilantis were co-authors of the same article, but did not share the prize.|$|E
5|$|On 11 November 2009, Wiens {{was found}} guilty of the murder of El-Sherbini and the {{attempted}} murder of Okaz, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Judge Birgit <b>Wiegand</b> stated that the court had also found that Wiens's deeds constituted a heinous crime, because they were committed in front of a child, against two people, in a court of law, and fulfilled the murder criterion of treacherousness, such as hatred against foreigners. It meant that Wiens received the maximum sentence for this crime. Wiens appealed the conviction; however, the appeal was rejected by the Federal Court of Justice. In a decision published on 18 June 2010, the fifth criminal division of the court of justice in Leipzig stated that the appeal on points of law was unfounded and confirmed the verdict and sentence of the regional court as final matter of criminal law.|$|E
5|$|Palmyra's first {{excavations}} {{were conducted}} in 1902 by Otto Puchstein and in 1917 by Theodor <b>Wiegand.</b> In 1929, French general director of antiquities of Syria and Lebanon Henri Arnold Seyrig began large-scale excavation of the site; interrupted by World War II, it resumed soon after the war's end. Seyrig started with the Temple of Bel in 1929 and between 1939 and 1940 he excavated the Agora. Daniel Schlumberger conducted excavations in the Palmyrene northwest countryside in 1934 and 1935 where he studied different local sanctuaries in the Palmyrene villages. From 1954 to 1956, a Swiss expedition organized by UNESCO excavated the Temple of Baalshamin. Since 1958, the site has been excavated by the Syrian Directorate-General of Antiquities, and Polish expeditions led by many archaeologists including Kazimierz Michałowski (until 1980) and Michael Gawlikowski (until 2011). The stratigraphic sounding beneath the Temple of Bel was conducted in 1967 by Robert du Mesnil du Buisson, who also discovered the Temple of Baal-hamon in the 1970s.|$|E

40|$|This {{contribution}} outlines {{a conceptual}} {{analysis of the}} dictionary-internal cross-reference structure in electronic dictionaries {{along the lines of}} <b>Wiegand’s</b> actional-theoretical text theory of print dictionaries. The discussion focuses on issues of XML-based data modeling, using the monolingual German online dictionary elexiko as a running example. The first part of the article demonstrates how <b>Wiegand’s</b> formal theory of mediostructure and its intricate nomenclature can be extended in a systematic and lexicographically justified way to cover the structure of the underlying lexicographical database of online dictionaries. The second part of the article applies the concepts developed to a more technical question, examining the extent to which cross-reference information can be stored and processed separately from the dictionary entry documents, e. g., in a relational database. The results are largely negative; in most real world cases, this leads to an unwanted duplication of XML-related structural information. The concluding third part briefly describes the strategy chosen for elexiko: mediostructural information is not externalized at all; cross-reference consistency checks are performed by a dictionary editing tool that takes advantage of a specialized XML database index and can easily be made more efficient and scalable by using a simple caching technique...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{concentrates}} on the inclusion and representation of borrowings from French into English and from English into French within the latest editions of English and French desk law dictionaries (Oxford Dictionary of Law, 2006 [ODoL] and Longman Dictionary of Law, 2007 [LDoL]; Vocabulaire Juridique, 2007 [VJ], Vocabulaire du Juriste Débutant, 2007 [VdJD]), which, according to their Prefaces, would seem to address the same or similar target user groups. After some preliminary remarks on the macrostructure of the dictionaries, we shall contrast their medio- and, most importantly, microstructures, {{with a focus on}} the lexicographic (as against terminological) definition of recent borrowings from and into the two languages. <b>Wiegand’s</b> (1992, 2003, 2005) theory of dictionary form will enable us to highlight striking differences across English and French dictionary entries. Whereas this might be accounted for in terms of their highly culture-dependent nature and, therefore, of the two different underlying legal systems (cf. e. g. the extended representation of estoppel or abatement in ODoL, as against estoppel and abattement in VJ), the same doesn’t hold good for recent borrowings from commercial law, international regulations (e. g. Incoterms 2000) or European law (e. g. copyright [ODoL] vs. copyright [VJ], or CE [ODoL] vs. Communautée Europeenne [VJ]). Most importantly, they seem to depend on two factors, whose interaction ultimately results into and motivates the observed differences at the macro-, medio- and microstrutural levels: a. different presuppositions on users' profiles and the special needs of target user groups (Bergenholz and Nielsen 2006) as related to <b>Wiegand's</b> (1998 : 52) notion of genuine purpose, which do systematically underpin the initial stages of any dictionary design or dictionary revision projects; b. differences in disciplinary cultures within communities of practice (Wenger 2008) and, possibly, national cultures (Katan 1999) ...|$|R
50|$|The first Westerner {{to visit}} the site was Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, {{commissioned}} by Louis XIV to travel in the East and report his findings. Tournefort visited Samos in 1704, and published his drawings of the ruins as engravings. Massive siltation deposits obscured, yet protected the site from amateur tinkering in the 18th and 19th centuries. Reedbeds and thorny brakes of blackberry canes provided daunting cover, and the water table, risen since Antiquity, discouraged trench-digging {{at the same time}} that it preserved wooden materials in anoxic strata. Thus the first preliminary archaeological excavations were delayed until 1890-92, under the direction of P. Kavvadias and Th. Sophoulis, from Athens, and the full extent of the third temple's foundations were not revealed until Theodor <b>Wiegand's</b> campaign of 1910-14.

40|$|One of {{the main}} {{problems}} facing speakers and language practitioners of indigenous African languages is the shortage of appropriate dictionaries {{for a variety of}} purposes. This lack results in users consulting any available but inappropriate dictionaries. Quite often, users are disappointed because a wrong dictionary does not normally provide the required assistance. Various functions, which the dictionary may serve, are sought in vain from inappropriate dictionaries and other terminological products. Consequently, the potential of lexicography in general and specialised lexicography in particular, remains unrealised owing to a variety of reasons. This article which mainly discusses the specialised dictionary, draws insights from <b>Wiegand's</b> (1984) general theory of lexicography and the theory of lexicographic functions (Bergenholtz and Tarp 1995, 2003; Tarp 2000, 2002, 2008) to affirm the role of specialised dictionaries in indigenous African languages and also to give insights into how such dictionaries may be produced.

50|$|<b>Wiegand's</b> {{site has}} been for many years {{identified}} as the Panionion. It was enclosed by a temenos wall, of which one to three courses can still be seen, with an entrance from the west. In the central area can be seen evidence of a 17.5 m by 4.25 m rectangular stone, presumed to be the altar of Poseidon, dated {{from the end of}} the 6th century BC. At the foot of the hill, 50 m southwest of the altar, is a small theatre or odeum. It is 32 m in diameter, a little bit more than semicircular, with 11 rows of seats, cut into solid rock, and is presumed to be the council chamber for the meetings of the Ionian League. It dates from the 4th century BC, when the Ionian League and the Panionia were revived. Between the sanctuary and the council chamber is a large cave, although what if any cult function it may have had is unknown. Ancient sources mention sacrifices, but no temple, and none has been found.|$|R

This article aims at reflecting the taste and the relevance of dictionary usage research 20 years later. I will argue that the fundamentally changed lexicographic landscape makes it necessary to shift the focus of research. In my view, the most important aim of research into dictionary use can no longer be limited to improving dictionaries. Research into dictionary use should also raise more awareness for user- orientation in general and should provide methodological reflection to enlighten the increasingly important usage statistics for online dictionaries. Another goal should be to look behind the scenes of collaborative dictionaries in order to provide background data to classify their relevance in relation to dictionaries elaborated by lexicographic experts. The crisis of lexicography makes it also necessary to broaden our view and concentrate on situations in which linguistic questions arise. In this context, we could examine in which of these situations the consultation of lexicographic data helps. In summary, the aim of research into dictionary use is to identify the fields where sound lexicographic work is really helpful for potential users...|$|R

500|$|David Bianco, {{reviewing}} the early episodes {{of the series}} for USA Today, found the show's villains to be its weakest link, praising Stevens, Keller, and Smart, and saying that though it [...] "may initially seem confusing and frustrating... if any show deserves your patience, it’s Legion. Rewards await." [...] In his review on RogerEbert.com, Brian Tallerico praised the series for its focus on character, especially by having none of its characters [...] "defined by their powers or their relation to a villain". He felt that the performances of Stevens and Keller were especially strong, but did think that the series took itself too seriously at times, lacking some of the humor usually found {{in the works of}} Hawley and Marvel. David <b>Wiegand</b> for the San Francisco Chronicle called Legion the best series of the new year, and praised the [...] "resolutely novelistic" [...] approach from Hawley. <b>Wiegand</b> felt, [...] "It would be facile to say Legion is a comic book show for people who don’t like comic book shows. At the same time, it does have a far more complex thematic and psychological structure than most comic book shows."

50|$|<b>Wiegand's</b> {{father had}} come to Bremen from the Upper Weser region and owned a {{profitable}} nursery and landscaping business. A teacher persuaded him to allow his son to study at the gymnasium {{and then go to}} university. He studied law at the universities of Erlangen, Bonn, Berlin and Strassburg, passed the bar at Lübeck and earned a Doctor of Law degree by examination at Göttingen in 1879, and went into practice as a lawyer in Bremen that same year. He was interested in transport and in 1878 had taken the state examination in Colmar and become a referendary as the first step to a career with the railway. In his first case for Norddeutscher Lloyd in 1884, he demonstrated an excellent mastery of maritime and business law; in 1889 he became the company's general counsel. Beginning {{at the end of that}} decade, he tried repeatedly to persuade businessmen in Bremen to promote industry, which the city lacked. In particular he attempted to make Bremen the base of operations for American development of electric trams in Germany through the Ludwig Loewe company of Berlin. These efforts having failed, he was on the point of moving to Berlin when Johann Georg Lohmann died suddenly on 9 February 1892 and he was chosen to succeed him as director of Norddeutscher Lloyd from 1 April 1892. Initially two vice presidents were to assist him; after two years both had retired and until his own death in 1909, he worked with Geo Plate, the head of the board of directors and the man who had proposed his name. In 1899 his title became general director and Plate's, president.|$|R

[...] New York Daily News critic Don Kaplan says [...] "conniving Congressman Frank Underwood, is easily {{one of the most}} complex antiheroes on TV — except he’s not on TV".

500|$|Ginia Bellafante, {{a critic}} for The New York Times, proclaimed the drama gave the {{audience}} [...] "innocent faces and heaving breasts, hyperbolizing the sex that always lurks {{beneath the surface}} of Austen's astringent presence." [...] She went on to say Northanger Abbey was made to be a television movie and commented that it was more fun than the book. The San Francisco Chronicle's David <b>Wiegand</b> wrote [...] "Persuasion is a bigger challenge to try to squeeze into 90 minutes, the real difference between that film and Northanger is the latter's consistency of high-quality performances, a careful and attentive adaptation by Andrew Davies and solid direction by Jon Jones." [...] Writing for The Daily Telegraph, James Walton observed [...] "Northanger Abbey was a perfectly acceptable costume drama – but not one that ever really caught fire."

500|$|Brian Lowry, {{reviewing}} for Variety, called [...] "The Long Bright Dark" [...] a [...] "rich and absorbing" [...] episode where True Detective immediately {{assumes a}} unique identity from other police procedurals, {{and wrote the}} cast ensemble consisted of [...] "fine players on the periphery". Writing in USA Today, Robert Bianco felt McConaughey and Harrelson not only met, but occasionally even exceeded [...] "enormously high" [...] performance expectations of the [...] "golden age of TV acting". David <b>Wiegand</b> of the San Francisco Chronicle singled out the duo as being [...] "in a class of their own", and Los Angeles Times journalist Robert Lloyd thought the character work from the two men was of [...] "a very high order". Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe, though found the program's grim tone to be occasionally excessive, opined {{that the two men}} successfully engaged audiences enough to invest in the series with their performances. Monaghan also received kudos from Rodman for her work in the episode.

The Daily Telegraph critic Michael Hogan singled out Dunst, Danson and Wilson for their work on the show, as did the San Francisco Chronicle David <b>Wiegand,</b> whose opinion was that many of the performers' signature roles enhanced Hawley's script. Matt Zoller Seitz of New York magazine found Wilson to be the stand out among a pool of actors that [...] "deserve their own stand-alone appreciations". He said of the actor's performance: [...] "He's a young man, and he's in good shape, but he carries himself like an older, heavier one, as if weighed down by burdens he hasn't fully acknowledged because he's not ready yet. You get a sense of a personality, perhaps a soul, in the process of evolving." [...] Reviews from Entertainment Weekly and The Washington Post singled out Donovan, Smart, Milioti, Garrett, and Offerman for their acting. Grantland, the New York Observer, and the Los Angeles Times also praised the ensemble performances.|$|E
500|$|Robert Bianco of USA Today {{felt the}} show benefited from not {{being picked up}} by ABC, where {{it would have been}} in the shadow of Desperate Housewives, and from being {{scheduled}} as summer television, where its competition was weak. Bianco believed that the various storylines were gracefully woven together in the scenes of the episode. Rob Owen of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette described the show as a guilty pleasure. Owen stated that although the show was not original for following Desperate Housewives path, it was good summer entertainment that managed to slip in a bit of [...] "social satire". Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times panned the show's pilot, describing it as [...] "a silly, hyperactive version of Downton Abbey", although she acknowledged that the episode had elements of The Great Gatsby (the opening murder) and West Side Story (the schoolgirl crush). San Francisco Chronicle critic David <b>Wiegand</b> said [...] "the pilot episode may not break any new ground, but it's energetic and funny". He also noted that [...] "it's a hoot the first time we see the maids get the better of their shallow, self-absorbed bosses...", but he felt that this theme might lack the depth to retain audience interest.|$|E
