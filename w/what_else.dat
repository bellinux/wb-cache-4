She moved to Perth in Western Australia when she was ten after her parents decided {{they wanted to see}} <b>what</b> <b>else</b> the world had to offer, and {{graduated}} from high school there in 2010. , she lives in Wanneroo, Western Australia.|$|E
5|$|In the epilogue, as September (Michael Cerveris) the Observer, watches, a {{blood sample}} from the child is drawn discreetly by one of Fauxlivia's captors posing as an orderly, who {{transfers}} it to Brandon (Ryan McDonald), who is revealed to have developed the accelerated pregnancy procedure under Walternate's orders. Meanwhile, Lincoln and Charlie become somewhat distrustful of Walternate after learning what he hid from them. They consider that Colonel Broyles (Lance Reddick) disappeared {{around the same time}} that Fauxlivia returned, and wonder <b>what</b> <b>else</b> Walternate is hiding from them.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Douglas {{attended}} a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: Mrs. Douglas was {{half the size}} of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember <b>what</b> <b>else.</b> Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to those of us who'd heard her speak.|$|E

25|$|There are few certain {{facts of}} van der Weyden's life. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> {{is known of}} him has come from civic records and {{secondary}} sources, {{and some of it}} is contestable. However the paintings now attributed to him are generally accepted, despite a tendency in the 19th century to attribute his work to others.|$|E
25|$|By {{then the}} panels {{had been removed}} from the frame and hidden, with the guards, on the narrow spiral {{staircase}} up the tower, with a locked door at ground level. They were not detected and the crowd left after destroying <b>what</b> <b>else</b> they could find. The panels were then moved to the town hall, and only returned to view in 1569, by which time the elaborate frame had disappeared.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the filmmakers}} worked around the stars' schedules, {{the filming of}} the whole movie took several years. While so many A-list actors were on board, most were not {{completely}} aware of what other sketches would {{be included in the}} film, which features thirteen vignettes tied together by a story of a mad screenwriter (Quaid) pitching ideas to a movie producer (Kinnear). Penotti said many of the actors did not ask many questions about <b>what</b> <b>else</b> {{was going on in the}} film.|$|E

25|$|Many of {{his works}} also contain letters and words added to the painting. He explains: The words in the {{paintings}} are sometimes important to make you start thinking about <b>what</b> <b>else</b> {{is going on in}} there. And a lot of times, the words excite me as shapes, and something'll grow out of that. I used to cut these little letters out and glue them on. They just look good all lined up like teeth... sometimes they become the title of the painting.|$|E
25|$|By 1943, Waldheim {{was serving}} in the {{capacity}} of an aide-de-camp in Army Group E which was headed by General Alexander Löhr. In 1986, Waldheim {{said that he had}} served only as an interpreter and a clerk and had no knowledge either of reprisals against local Serb civilians or of massacres in neighboring provinces of Yugoslavia. He said that he had known {{about some of the things}} that had happened, and had been horrified, but could not see <b>what</b> <b>else</b> he could have done.|$|E

25|$|Despite the price, the 1990s {{became an}} era of {{experimentation}} to see <b>what</b> <b>else</b> growth hormone could help. The medical literature of the decade contains hundreds of reports of small trials of GH use in nearly every type of growth failure and shortness imaginable. In most cases, the growth responses were modest. For conditions with a large enough potential market, more rigorous trials were sponsored by pharmaceutical companies that were making growth hormone to achieve approval to market for those specific indications. Turner syndrome and chronic renal failure were {{the first of these}} “nonGH-deficient causes of shortness” to receive FDA approval for GH treatment, and Prader-Willi syndrome and intrauterine growth retardation followed. Similar expansion of use occurred in Europe.|$|E
25|$|To begin with, Kant's {{distinction}} between the a posteriori being contingent and particular knowledge, and the a priori being universal and necessary knowledge, must be kept in mind. For if we merely connect two intuitions together in a perceiving subject, the knowledge is always subjective because it is derived a posteriori, when what is desired is for the knowledge to be objective, that is, for the two intuitions {{to refer to the}} object and hold good of it necessarily universally for anyone at any time, not just the perceiving subject in its current condition. <b>What</b> <b>else</b> is equivalent to objective knowledge besides the a priori, that is to say, universal and necessary knowledge? Nothing else, and hence before knowledge can be objective, it must be incorporated under an a priori category of the understanding.|$|E
25|$|The two {{horsemen}} of {{this particular}} apocalypse—the external deficit and the swift rise of Central Bank credit—would have made 1988 a bad year no matter <b>what</b> <b>else</b> happened. But President García guaranteed financial disaster by his totally unexpected decision in July 1987 to nationalize the banks not already under government ownership. No one has yet been able {{to explain why he}} decided to do so. It would not seem to have been a move necessary for any component of his program, or needed for government control in a banking sector in which it already had a dominant position. In any case, the action underlined the unilateral character of economic policy action under Peru's presidential system and wrecked any possibilities of further cooperation with private sector leadership. Private investment began to fall, and the whole economy followed it down shortly thereafter.|$|E

25|$|Monty {{has brought}} {{supplies}} and persistently comes on to Marwood. He offers {{to take them}} into town to get fitted into rubber boots, but they end up spending the money he gave them on drinks. Monty is hurt, though he puts {{it out of his}} mind quickly during a boozy round of poker. Marwood is terrified of <b>what</b> <b>else</b> Monty might try on him and wants to leave immediately. After much argument, Withnail insists on staying. Late in the night, Marwood keeps trying to evade Monty but he eventually corners him in the guest bedroom. Monty reveals that Withnail, when arranging to borrow the cottage, had told Monty that Marwood was a closeted homosexual and that he himself had rejected Marwood's advances. Marwood claims that Withnail is the closeted one and {{that the two of them}} have been in a committed relationship for years. He claims that Withnail is only rejecting him because Monty is around, and that this is the first night that they haven't slept together in years. Monty, a romantic, accepts this explanation and apologises for coming between them. In private, Marwood furiously confronts Withnail and insists that he will pay.|$|E
25|$|In August 2017, he {{was asked}} whether he might have {{acquired}} Greek citizenship through his mother, born in Greece, and British or Cypriot nationality through his father, an ethnic Greek {{who was born in}} Cyprus when it was a British colony and who possessed a British passport. He stated: “I’ve never had, never sought, never received citizenship of another country but out of an abundance of caution I wrote to the Greek embassy and Cypriot high commission saying essentially, ‘I’ve never been a citizen, I don’t want to be, so if there’s any question that I could be, I renounce any rights to be’. I don’t know <b>what</b> <b>else</b> I can do in the circumstances.” He added that he had not received replies to these enquiries. Later he said he had renounced Greek citizenship but, on finding he might be British, he had sought clarification from British authorities. On 19 August, he announced that British authorities had confirmed he is a British Overseas citizen, a lesser form of British nationality. He stated that he would not resign from the Parliament, but would await a High Court decision. Together with that of Nash, Xenophon's case was referred to the Court on 4 September.|$|E

25|$|Harry is Edna’s {{husband and}} Tobias’s best friend. At {{one point in}} the past, Harry and Tobias, coincidentally, had an extramarital affair with the same young woman. Besides both having been {{businessmen}} and meeting at the same club, it is unclear <b>what</b> <b>else</b> Harry and Tobias have in common except that they have known one another {{for a long time and}} neither sleeps with his wife. Harry is something of a reflection of Tobias, but he is even more reserved. Of all the characters in this play, Harry speaks the least. And when he does speak, he is a man of few words with lots of pauses around each one. He prefers to talk around things rather than going at them straight on. He also avoids questions, as when Agnes tries to find out why he and his wife have come to their home. Instead of giving Agnes an answer, he compliments the furnishings in Agnes’s home. He also has the tendency to repeat himself; at one point he repeats the same line four times when he tries to explain how fear has driven his wife and him out of their home. It is Harry, in the end, who tells Tobias that he and Edna have decided to leave. Although Harry prompted the discussion with Edna about resolving the issue of staying at their friends’ house, it is implied that Edna made the decision and that Harry just delivered the message.|$|E
