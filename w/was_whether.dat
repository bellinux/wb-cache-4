5|$|On {{appeal to}} the Court of Appeal, three issues were raised. The first issue <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> the plaintiffs (appellants) had the {{requisite}} locus standi. The second <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> {{there had been an}} inordinate delay on the appellants' part in pursuing the matter in court. The third issue is the most significant, namely, whether the acquisition of the temple property violated Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} on appeal before the Seventh Circuit <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> the Illinois district court could properly exercise personal jurisdiction over Hemi.|$|E
5|$|A {{major issue}} in her initial {{election}} <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> the two candidates would vote to override President George W. Bush's veto of {{an expansion of the}} State Children's Health Insurance Program. Tsongas said she would vote to override, and it was reported Ogonowski would uphold the veto. Hours after being sworn into office on October 18, Tsongas voted to override, but the vote failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds majority.|$|E
50|$|Freundel saw {{two issues}} with cloning humans from a halakhic perspective. The first <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> cloning <b>is</b> allowed, {{and the second}} <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> a clone would be {{considered}} a human being.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{question}} about {{a set of}} Wang tiles <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> it can tile the plane or not, i.e., whether an entire infinite plane can be filled this way. The next question <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> this can <b>be</b> done in a periodic pattern.|$|R
50|$|The {{argument}} <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> I came first.|$|R
5|$|Another {{question}} in the case <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, had jurisdiction to hear the case. Hill argued {{that because of the}} structure of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918, the court could not hear the case. She argued that elections could not be disputed by petition if the dispute was about the eligibility of a candidate, as another provision of the Act meant that it would require a resolution of the relevant house of Parliament, the Senate in this case.|$|E
5|$|Bradley {{declared}} his candidacy {{early for the}} Republican gubernatorial nomination in 1895, and no real challenger emerged prior to the Republicans' nominating convention. Consequently, Bradley was nominated in a relatively harmonious convention. The major issue of the campaign <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> the country should maintain a monetary system based on the gold standard or allow the coinage of silver {{at a ratio of}} 16 to 1, commonly called the free silver position. At their convention, the Republicans adopted a platform that was unequivocally in favor of the gold standard.|$|E
5|$|Conditions in {{the casual}} wards were worse {{than in the}} {{relieving}} rooms and deliberately designed to discourage vagrants, who were considered potential trouble-makers and probably disease-ridden. Vagrants who presented themselves {{at the door of}} a workhouse were {{at the mercy of the}} porter, whose decision it <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> or not to allocate them a bed for the night in the casual ward. Those refused entry risked being sentenced to two weeks of hard labour if they were found begging or sleeping in the open and prosecuted for an offence under the Vagrancy Act 1824.|$|E
5000|$|If the tort {{is related}} to the contract, the next {{question}} to <b>be</b> resolved <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> any reliance by the plaintiff on the employee was reasonable. The question here <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> the plaintiff reasonably relied on the eventual legal responsibility of the defendants under the circumstances.|$|R
30|$|The {{assumption}} {{so far is}} that ontologies {{provide a}} rich enough semantic model of data would {{address the problem of}} data interoperability or considerably reduce it. While this assumption is still to be proven, three important questions need to be addressed. The first one <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> there <b>are</b> ontologies to leverage on. The second one <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> these ontologies <b>are</b> authoritative enough to prevent the case of multiple conflicting ontologies; otherwise, the hope of semantics would be void. The third one <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> the underlying logic frameworks are computationally feasible.|$|R

5|$|France outlawed {{the most}} radical {{political}} party, the Union des Populations du Cameroun (UPC), on 13 July 1955. This prompted a long guerrilla war and {{the assassination of the}} party's leader, Ruben Um Nyobé. In the more peaceful British Cameroons, the question <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> to reunify with French Cameroun or join Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|In 1974, DARPA {{secretly}} requested {{answers from}} five aircraft manufacturers regarding two considerations. The first {{was about the}} signature thresholds at which an aircraft is virtually undetectable. The second point <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> these companies {{had the capacity to}} design and manufacture such an aircraft. Fairchild and Grumman declined to participate, while General Dynamics insisted on the use of electronic countermeasures. As a result, General Dynamics left the discussion. The remaining two companies, McDonnell Douglas and Northrop, were each awarded $100,000 for further research.|$|E
5|$|In 2010 Bamber's lawyers {{highlighted}} {{two police}} logs {{in support of}} Bamber's application to have his case referred back to the Court of Appeal. The question <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> these logs support the prosecution position that there was one call that night to the police, from Bamber alone; or the defence position {{that there were two}} calls to police, one from Nevill followed by a second from Bamber.|$|E
40|$|AbstractOne of {{the open}} {{questions}} about the modal mu-calculus <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> the alternation hierarchy collapses; that <b>is,</b> <b>whether</b> all modal fixpoint properties can be expressed {{with only a few}} alternations of least and greatest fixpoints.

5|$|In Multani v. Marguerite-Bourgeoys (Commission scolaire) (2006), {{the issue}} <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> a ban {{in a public}} school on Sikh {{students}} carrying kirpans (ceremonial daggers) for religious purposes was justifiable. Justice Louise Charron, who delivered the Court's majority opinion, applied the Oakes test to section 2(a) of the Charter. She held that the school could not discharge its burden of proving that prohibiting the kirpan was a reasonable limit on the student's constitutional freedom of religion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s CDOT began {{considering}} {{plans for a}} replacement bridge. The major issue <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> a new bridge should be built along the same alignment as the existing bridge, or instead curve westward to make a more direct connection with the interstate's Exit 116. After a public hearing in August 2012, the agency announced that the latter seemed to be overwhelmingly preferred. It remained {{to decide whether to}} have a signalized intersection or a roundabout at the intersection of Sixth Street and Laurel Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Justice Stephen Breyer {{delivered}} {{the opinion of}} the court on April 19, 2004. Breyer believed that the question the Court needed to answer <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> Congress had the authority to relax restrictions that had been imposed on an Indian tribe's inherent sovereignty. He noted that the intent of Congress was clear, not only based on the plain language of the statute, but also from its legislative history.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{volatile}} issues of the 1880s <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> the currency should be backed by gold and silver, or by gold alone. The issue cut across party lines, with western Republicans and southern Democrats joining together in the call for the free coinage of silver, and both parties' representatives in the northeast holding firm for the gold standard. Because silver was worth less than its legal equivalent in gold, taxpayers paid their government bills in silver, while international creditors demanded payment in gold, resulting in a depletion of the nation's gold supply.|$|E
5|$|The D'Oliveira {{affair was}} a {{prolonged}} political and sporting controversy {{relating to the}} scheduled 1968–69 tour of South Africa by the England cricket team, who were officially representing the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). The point of contention <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> or not the England selectors would include Basil D'Oliveira, a mixed-race South African player who had represented England in Test cricket since 1966, having moved there six years earlier. With South Africa under apartheid, the potential inclusion by England of a non-white South African in their tour party became a political issue.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} in the case <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> Al-Kateb's continued detention was lawful. That {{question in}}volved several issues, namely whether {{the provisions of the}} Migration Act allow a person to be detained even if they have no prospect of being removed from Australia, and if they did, whether those provisions were then lawful under the Constitution of Australia.|$|E

The second set of outcomes <b>were</b> <b>whether</b> the student made eye contact with their partner prior to the defibrillator analysing the cardiac rhythm, prior to charging the defibrillator, and prior to “shocking” the patient. The final set of outcomes <b>were</b> <b>whether</b> the student made a visual scan of the immediate area prior to the defibrillator analysing the cardiac rhythm, prior to charging the defibrillator, and prior to “shocking” the patient.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: I discuss {{three issues}} about the {{relation}} of phenomenal consciousness, in the sense Siewert isolates, to intentionality. The first <b>is</b> <b>whether,</b> contrary to Siewert, phenomenal consciousness requires higher-order representation. The second <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> intentional features of conscious states are identical with phenomenal features, as Siewert argues, or merely conceptually supervene on them, with special attention to cross modal representations of objects in space. The third <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> phenomenal features <b>are</b> identical with what we can have first person access to, with special attention to features of thoughts that are individuated by reference to {{the self and the}} present time. 1...|$|R

5|$|The {{second issue}} <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> {{indefinite}} detention for migration purposes infringed on Chapter III of the Australian Constitution. While every judge discussed this issue, only three judges, Justices McHugh, Hayne and Heydon, {{found it necessary}} to make a final decision on the issue. They all reached the same conclusion, that the detention scheme was constitutional.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the regular}} season, a {{constant}} question {{hanging over the}} Virginia Tech Hokies football team <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> or not star quarterback Michael Vick would return for another year at the school. The National Football League requires that players be {{at least three years}} out of high school before they are eligible for the NFL Draft. Vick, who had not played during his freshman year at the school, would be three years out of high school in the spring following the Gator Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Among Beshear's other {{activities}} as lieutenant governor was {{his participation in}} an investigation of Kentucky Utilities' coal-buying practices. At issue <b>was</b> <b>whether</b> it was legal and ethical for the company's coal buyer to accept gifts and other perks from coal suppliers. Beshear had clashed with the company over similar issues during his term as attorney general. The company attempted to block Beshear's participation in the investigation, but the Kentucky Public Service Commission rejected the attempt. Due {{to the length of}} the investigation and the number of appeals filed, the matter was not fully adjudicated until 1992, well past the end of Beshear's term. The Kentucky Supreme Court ultimately ruled in favor of Kentucky Utilities.|$|E
