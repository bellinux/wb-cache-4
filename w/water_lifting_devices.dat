Two quite {{different}} forms of property rights emerged during this period. In the Orbigo valley, small groups of farmers held the majority of <b>water</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> and ground water as common property. On a high plain above, farmers held <b>water</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> and groundwater as private property. Schema theory is combined with transaction cost economics to address this divergence in property rights. A two stage process is suggested.

40|$|Rainfed crop {{production}} in the semi-arid areas is associated with high risk of rainfall variability which occasionally leads to complete crop failure. Most of the farmers in Atsbi-Womberta district of Eastern Tigray region, northern Ethiopia, have been classified as food insecure. To improve farmers’ livelihoods in the district, interventions targeted at resource conservation and better use of conserved water for market-oriented irrigated crops development have been promoted. This paper analyses the process and outcome of shifting towards market-oriented irrigated crops development and compares variation in income between beneficiary and nonbeneficiary households. The transformation processes are based on market-oriented diversification into high value irrigated crops, based on a value chain approach, and demand driven, participatory and knowledge based extension. The paper also assesses the response of smallholder farmers to emerging opportunities and challenges, and the spectrum of transformation processes and strategies followed to bring changes in smallholder farmers’ income. The changes associated with the interventions were systematically captured using household level surveys, specialized studies and key informant interviews. Results show that farmers gradually shifted to non-cereal, more market-oriented irrigated crops, in which the share of market-oriented irrigated crops increased from 27 % of the total irrigated land in 2004 to 89 % in 2009. Similarly, the total irrigated area increased by about fourfold {{and the number of}} beneficiaries by about threefold due to improved use of conserved surface and groundwater, and investment in farmer skills and <b>water</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>devices.</b> Moreover, crop diversification and intensification of households increased in response to emerging opportunities and challenges. Annual cropping intensity shifted from mono-crop cereal to 2 – 3 high value diversified crop farming by some farmers. On aggregate, average income of beneficiary households increased by about ninefold compared to non-beneficiary households. In the transformation, there have been continuous and interconnected processes and strategies in improving the effectiveness of adopting and using new skills and knowledge in harvesting and productive use of water, and responsive capacity of the extension system and partners. The lessons imply that investment in resources conservation could be enhanced if linked with short-term income generating activities through linkages with markets.

Tremendous efforts have been made by the government to cope up the utilize problem as to increase the status of the productivity per unit area by incorporating irrigation that could be utilize by individual HH. When the issue of economic growth and development of the country is raised, one has {{to take into account the}} performance of the smallholder farmers. Reducing the challenges they are facing and utilizing their potentials can help to accelerate the agricultural sector and economic development of the country as a whole. Agricultural cooperatives are an ideal means for selfreliance, higher productivity level and promotion of agricultural development. Therefore, the major concern of this study is empirically analyzing the factors affecting proper utilization of water through irrigation cooperatives found in the Kolla tembien district. Both primary and secondary data were taken for this study. All the irrigation cooperatives the study area select and a total of 120 sample respondents from kola tembien district. Primary data pertaining collected from selected respondents through structured questionnaire. The total respondents, of the cooperative are members for proper utilize of water. Secondary data of the cooperatives for recognizing irrigation cooperatives. The descriptive statistics was to analyze the mean difference of continuous and frequency difference of dummy variables. The Nominal logistic regression model was employed to find functional relationships between the explanatory and dependent variables by utilization categories, which were found differently using the irrigation for different purposes. The result of descriptive statistical analysis showed that, out of the 18 hypothesized variables only seven variables (irrigation experience, off-farm income activity, <b>water</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>devices,</b> training, vi slope of the farm,soil type of the farm and perception of the members) showed significance difference at 1 % and 5 % significant level.

40|$|The Raya {{valley in}} Tigray where Alamata Woreda is located, has fertile soil, {{suitable}} climate and rich water resources to grow various crops including vegetables. Surface water from seasonal rivers/streams and small dams and ground water extracted from deep and shallow wells with various <b>water</b> <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> {{are the two}} main sources of water for irrigation in the Woreda. A participatory rural appraisal (PRA) {{study conducted by the}} Woreda stakeholders and facilitated by IPMS identified (irrigated) vegetables as a potential marketable commodity in 2005. Using the commodity value chain approach, production, input supply and marketing problems and opportunities were identified. Major problems were lack of interest {{partly as a result of}} market failure in the past, lack of agronomic and irrigation knowledge and skills resulting in lack of use of advanced agronomic inputs (e. g. seeds) and underutilization of modern irrigation facilitates (most of the deep wells established were not used and/or underutilized). Different extension approaches were used including study tours to change the mind-set and to acquire knowledge for experts and farmers. Following various production interventions, market linkages were created which resulted in better prices (from 0. 70 Birr/kg before 2005 to 3 - 5 Birr/kg in the following years). Farmer to farmer communications, trainings, workshops and media coverage facilitated the further dissemination of knowledge and skills between PAs in Alamata and neighboring Woredas. As a result of these interventions, the area of irrigated onion, pepper and tomato tripled in size from 351 ha in 2004 / 05 to 1113 ha in 2008 / 09. The lion share of this increase was due to a ten fold increase in onion area from 84 ha in 2004 / 05 to 824 ha in 2008 / 09. Most of this increase took place in the spate irrigated areas where plots previously used for cereal crops (sorghum and teff) were converted to vegetables. Both women and men farmers benefited from the intervention. Many farmers managed to construct houses in town and were able to own different assets. The further expansion of the (irrigated) vegetable production in Alamata is feasible. However, more attention needs to be paid to improving productivity, especially in the spate irrigated areas since no clear evidence was found that area increase was accompanied by productivity increase, indicating lack of adequate institutional and farmers’ knowledge and skills. Also adverse weather conditions during the 2008 harvesting season, resulted in considerable crop spoilage and lower prices – indicating the risk associated with this commodity under rain-fed conditions. Finally, potential salinity problems should also be taken into account. Canadian International Development Agenc...|$|E

40|$|Among nurses, {{low back}} pain is a common {{musculoskeletal}} disorder. A significant proportion of back pain episodes {{can be attributed to}} events that occur during patient handling activities when nurses are exposed to heavy lifting, awkward back postures, and pushing and/or pulling. In the past years, many ergonomic interventions have been developed, like <b>lifting</b> <b>devices,</b> to reduce mechanical load related to patient handling activities in order to (partly) decrease the occurrence of {{low back pain}}. The efficacy of <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> designed to reduce mechanical load has been demonstrated in several laboratory studies. However, the timely and integrated implementation at the workplace remains difficult. Various intervention studies have indicated that individual behaviour of nurses is a key factor in successful implementation of <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> in healthcare. As examples, Evanoff et al. (2003) and Li et al. (2004) identified the lack of perceived need to use lifts as an important barrier in the effectiveness of <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> at the workplace. Nelson et al. (2006) showed that acceptance of patient handling equipment by the staff was a crucial facilitator in the implementation process of a multiple intervention aimed at patient handling in healthcare. A previous study in hospitals and nursing homes showed that individual behaviour of nurses, i. e. nurses’ motivation to use <b>lifting</b> <b>devices,</b> was strongly associated with <b>lifting</b> <b>devices</b> use. This study also pointed at the influence of organisationallevel measures on nurses’ behaviour, comprising both factors in each ward {{as well as at the}} managerial level of the healthcare institute. Thus, the appropriate implementation of ergonomic devices requires a careful process whereby individual behaviour is supported by organisational measures in order to enable and support the individual to adopt the required behaviour to prevent musculoskeletal complaints.
