5|$|The {{brain of}} Allosaurus, as {{interpreted}} from spiral CT scanning of an endocast, was {{more consistent with}} crocodilian brains {{than those of the}} other living archosaurs, birds. The structure of the vestibular apparatus indicates that the skull was held nearly horizontal, as opposed to strongly tipped up or down. The structure of the inner ear <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of a crocodilian, and so Allosaurus probably could have heard lower frequencies best, and would have had trouble with subtle sounds. The olfactory bulbs were large and seem to have been well suited for detecting odors, although the area for evaluating smells was relatively small.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the international organization, the Temple sponsors initiatory Orders and Elements and local groups called Pylons. Pylons are intended to facilitate the initiatory work of the Temple's members by conducting meetings where discussions and magical works take place. The purpose of a pylon {{is to provide a}} space in which the Setian can focus on their religion, aided by like-minded individuals. Pylons typically meet in a member's home. Members usually join the Pylon located geographically closest to them. Correspondence- or Internet-based Pylons also exist, with Harvey noting that this online networking is more common than in-person interaction. A Pylon is led a by a second-degree (or higher) member who is called a Sentinel. The term pylon derives from the architectural features which served as fortified gateways to ancient Egyptian temples. One Finnish Setian informed Granholm that the relationship between the orders and the temple <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of different departments in a university.|$|E

25|$|During the 19th century, Harriet Powers made quilts {{in rural}} Georgia, United States {{that are now}} {{considered}} among the finest examples of 19th-century Southern quilting.

25|$|The {{hull of the}} Type H <b>was,</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of its predecessors, {{a single}} step design. A pair of flat {{bottomed}} floats, mounted below the outer interplane struts, stabilized the aircraft on the water. Two flight crew members were accommodated side-by-side and a front gunner sat separately in the nose. The rounded, finless rudder mounted above the high tailplane distinguished the Type H from earlier FBA flying boats, which had angular vertical tails.|$|E
25|$|In this phase, the {{settlement}} was fortified, using dried mud bricks, {{from the beginning}} of occupation. This fort had been built twice in different periods. Earlier, fort wall had a thickness of 1.9meters, which was raised to 3.7-4.1meters during reconstruction in this phase. Brick size was 20 × 20 × 10cm in both construction-phases. The citadel mound (smaller mound) is a parallelogram about 130meters on the east-west axis and 260meters on the north-south. Town planning <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of Mohenjodaro or Harappa. The direction of houses and brick sizes was markedly different from that used in the Harappan phase (KLB-II).|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{defection}} of {{some former}} supporters, many Zuma supporters continued to rally outside the courthouse, arousing criticism by anti-rape groups for regular {{attacks on the}} integrity and moral standing of Zuma's accuser, insults yelled at {{a close friend of}} the accuser, and even stones thrown at a woman that members of the crowd mistook for the accuser. Zuma's defence team introduced evidence relating to the woman's sexual past, and asserted that the sex that took place was consensual. The prosecution asserted that her lack of resistance was due to a state of shock, and that {{the relationship between the two}} <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of a 'father-daughter' pair.|$|E

25|$|The Jin Yang Qiu (晉陽秋) by Sun Sheng {{mentioned}} that Lu Kang was on friendly {{terms with the}} Jin general Yang Hu even though they stood on opposing sides. Their friendship was likened to that of Gongsun Qiao and Ji Zha (季札) in the Spring and Autumn period. Lu Kang once sent wine to Yang Hu, who drank it without showing any signs of suspicion. Later, when Lu Kang fell sick, Yang Hu sent medicine to him, which Lu also took without suspecting anything.

25|$|Robertson {{reported}} to the War Cabinet (14 November) that Italy’s situation <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of Russia in 1915 and that she might not recover. In his paper “Future Military Policy” (19 November), Robertson {{was impressed by the}} French Army’s recovery under Petain but advised that lack of French reserves might make major French offensives in 1918 unlikely. He rejected a purely defensive posture in the west, as even defending would still result in heavy casualties, but was sceptical of Haig’s wish to renew the Ypres Offensive in Spring 1918, and argued that Britain should build up her strength on the Western Front and then decide on the scale of her 1918 offensives. He warned (correctly) that, with Russia dropping out of the war, the Germans would use the opportunity to attack in 1918 before the American Expeditionary Force were present in strength. Lloyd George replied (wrongly) that the Germans would not attack and would fail if they did.|$|E
25|$|The Superman of pre-Crisis Earth-17 was the {{original}} Overman, created by the government as were the other heroes of this Earth. Likewise, all other heroes that were created were modified clones of Overman's cell scrapings, such as versions of Wonder Woman, Flash, and Green Lantern. Some time later, Overman went on a homicidal rampage (due to an STD which had affected his mind) and murdered everyone on the planet before he decided to commit suicide and destroy the planet {{at the same time}} with a doomsday bomb. This world was destroyed, and Overman was wiped out by the Crisis, until the Psycho-Pirate began bringing back characters which the Crisis had killed in Animal Man #23, Overman and bomb included, despite trying not to remember him. Overman fought against Ultraman and Animal Man, before Overman was dragged out of the comic book panels and wiped out by a closing panel, ranting that it wasn't his fault he <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> before Animal Man disarmed the bomb. In The New 52 DC Multiverse, Earth-17 is the world of the Atomic Knights and lacks a known Superman analogue.|$|E

Similarly, the infructescences were like B.prionotes in size, but had persistent flowers like B.hookeriana. Inflorescences and leaves were intermediate in size and shape, and bark <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of B.prionotes.|$|E

500|$|Our {{understanding}} of the morphology of Mesopropithecus {{has not always been}} so complete. [...] Until recently, important pieces of the skeleton had not been discovered, including the radius, ulna, vertebrae, hand and foot bones, and the pelvis. [...] In 1936, Alice Carleton mistakenly associated postcranial remains of the diademed sifaka (Propithecus diadema) from Ampasambazimba with Mesopropithecus pithecoides and came to the false conclusion that its morphology <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> of a monkey. [...] This mistaken attribution was corrected in 1948 by Charles Lamberton.|$|E

[...] Vandernoot had {{to adapt to the}} North American way of filming series and learn to work fast. She said that filming the series was [...] "...exhausting but formative", and that filming in English was [...] "challenging". Vandernoot, who is a native French speaker, had a dialect coach.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the second season, Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend commented: [...] "The worst moments of this season are merely uninspired, never truly horrible. Slight misses like “Dancin' Homer”, “One Fish, Two Fish, Blowfish, Blue Fish”, “Bart's Dog Gets an F”, and “The War of the Simpsons” are a bit flat. But even in their lowest points, humor is easy to find." [...] Jeremy Roebuck of KVUE named this episode, along with [...] "Bart Sells His Soul", [...] "Homer the Heretic", [...] "Simpsons Bible Stories", and [...] "She of Little Faith", one of the best Simpsons episodes with a {{religious}} theme. Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought Homer's line to Bart, [...] "I want to share something with you, the three little sentences that will get you through life. Number one: 'Cover for me.' Number two: 'Oh, good idea, boss.' Number three, 'It <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>that</b> when I got here.'", was the best line of the episode.|$|E
