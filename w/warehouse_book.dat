6000|$|There was a {{preliminary}} warning given by that clock {{some time before}} the premonitory hiss. Between this harbinger of coming events, and the joyful sound which was felt to be [...] "an age," [...] Ned was wont to wipe his pen and arrange his papers. When the hiss began, he invariably closed his <b>warehouse</b> <b>book</b> and laid it in the desk, and had the desk locked before the first stroke of the hour. While the [...] "minute-gun at sea" [...] was going on, he changed his office-coat for a surtout, not perfectly new, and a white hat with a black band, the rim of which was not perfectly straight. So exact and methodical was Ned in these operations, that his hand usually fell on the door-latch as the last gun was fired by the aggravating clock. On occasions of unusual celerity he even managed to drown the last shot in the bang of the door, and went off with a sensation of triumph.|$|E
5000|$|Consultants {{proposed}} a new library system that involved 2 to 4 branch locations, a centralized <b>warehouse,</b> <b>book</b> dispensing kiosks, book [...] "drop points," [...] and a reading room. This {{would cut the}} library budget to $165,000 per year. The decision for the proposal will not be made until the November 2010 election. However, even if the plan is approved, the county supervisors foresee even more choppy waters for the following year's budget.|$|E

5000|$|Kinsella's 14-year-long {{exit from}} the world of {{published}} fiction also may have had economic roots. He was cited as an archetypical victim of changes in the publishing industry during the late 1980s, which accelerated during the 1990s, that made it more difficult for well-regarded [...] "mid-list" [...] writers such as Kinsella to remain in print. Changes to the U.S. tax code effected by the Tax Reform Act of 1986 discouraged publishers from maintaining inventories of titles in their back lists, as they were taxed on <b>warehoused</b> <b>books.</b>|$|R

It {{was bought by}} students, priests, scholars, merchants, and other people, mostly in Vienna, Budapest, Novi Sad, Osijek, and Oradea, where Avramović was the district inspector for Serbian and Romanian schools from 1792 {{until his death in}} 1806. In 1792, Stefan Novaković bought Kurzbeck's Cyrillic press and <b>warehouse</b> of <b>books.</b> When he sold them to the Pest University Press in 1795, there were 360 unsold copies of the Avramović Dictionary in the <b>warehouse.</b> The <b>book</b> was listed in the university's sale catalogues until 1829. It was part of the library of Sava Tekelija, who wrote additional entries in his copy. The first edition of Vuk Karadžić's Serbian Dictionary appeared in 1818 as the first book in modern literary Serbian, based on the Eastern Herzegovinian dialect. There are indications that Karadžić used the Avramović Dictionary as a source for his work.|$|R

40|$|A {{preservation}} {{environment is}} the most cost-effective collection management tool that librarians and archivists have for extending the. collective life expectancy of their vast scholarly resources. The preservation environment built in a modern library shelving facility embodies a conscious commitment to preservation and distinguishes such a building from a <b>book</b> <b>warehouse,</b> a <b>book</b> attic, or a typical full-service library. The concept of a "preservation environment" is a complex one. that has emerged over nearly a century of concern over deteriorating library collections, several key conceptual breakthroughs in the past 40 years, and focused research in materials science. This chapter reviews how {{the idea of the}} library building as a preservation facility has changed over time, how materials science has contributed to the definition of a preservation environment, and how architects, engineers, and librarians designed the Yale University Library Shelving Facility to maximize the building's preservation value. The chapter concludes by identifying one lingering preservation issue that requires further research...|$|R

50|$|By 2005, it {{was very}} evident that the Atria was very far from the league of the newer and larger {{complexes}} nearby such as 1 Utama, Ikano Power Centre and The Curve. The main anchor tenant on Level 3, the Popular Bookstore decided to terminate its presence at the Atria. Popular Bookstore had by then established its flagship store at the newly opened Ikano Power Centre and in addition a smaller branch at 1-Utama. The Level 3 location vacated by the Popular Bookstore was soon occupied by the Big Bookshop. Later, the Big Bookshop also operated a permanent <b>book</b> <b>warehouse</b> at the First Floor space that had been occupied by the Parkson Grand department store.

50|$|After {{contributing}} to the periodical The Truth Seeker for decades, Johnson helped Smith relocate from New York City in 1964, then took over the ailing magazine after Smith's October 26, 1964 death, systematically driving its circulation further down through sloppy editing and shabby publication practices, mainly using it to promote and sell a <b>warehouse</b> of <b>books</b> printed in past decades. Although very wealthy, his entire operation put up the appearance of near-bankruptcy, mainly {{because he was a}} tightwad and misanthrope, according to journalist Mimi Swartz, and would never trust anybody else to manage his magazine, and only trusted a few people other than himself to write articles for it.|$|R

Established according to standardised methods, they are formed by assembling cooperative everything that the participating associations may gather or classify. Closely consolidated and coordinated in all of their parts and enriched by duplicates of all private works wherever undertaken, these collections will tend progressively to constitute a permanent and complete representation of the entire world (Union of International Associations, 1914, p. 116).|$|R

40|$|To {{change from}} collection-centric to user-centered {{research}} libraries and {{to survive in}} tough economic times, libraries face 2 major challenges: 1 st, libraries need to change how they are viewed by their constituencies so they are seen as indispensable; and 2 nd, libraries need to help the librarians and staff change their own mental models of their roles to remain relevant in these changing times. Metaphors are one way to help people connect terms in new ways so they develop new images of those terms. For more than 100 years, libraries have used metaphors to seek connections that will help people see libraries as something other than <b>warehouses</b> for <b>books.</b> This article will explore various metaphors {{being used in the}} library field and how these metaphors can help libraries introduce change to improve their chances of receiving the support needed to survive...|$|R
