500|$|Despite Cain's disability, author Andersen Gabrych {{describes}} the character's unique form of language {{as the key}} factor in what makes Cain an excellent detective; the ability to <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> and [...] "know" [...] something is wrong based on body language. During the first arc of the Batgirl comic book series entitled [...] "Silent Running", Cassandra Cain encounters a psychic who [...] "reprograms" [...] her brain, enabling her to comprehend verbal language, while simultaneously losing the ability to predict movements. This issue is resolved during the second arc of the series, [...] "A Knight Alone", when Batgirl encounters the assassin Lady Shiva who agrees to teach her how to predict movement once again. Six years after its debut, DC Comics canceled the Batgirl comic book series with issue #73 (2006), ending with Cain relinquishing her role as Batgirl.|$|E
500|$|In May 2005, English actor Daniel Craig stated MGM and {{producers}} Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli had assured {{him he would}} get the role of Bond, and Matthew Vaughn told reporters MGM offered {{him the opportunity to}} direct the new film, but Eon Productions at that point had not approached either of them. A year beforehand, Craig rejected the idea of starring, as he felt the series had descended into formula; only when he read the script did he become interested. Craig read all of Fleming's novels to prepare for the part, and cited Mossad and British Secret Service agents who served as advisors on the set of Munich as inspiring because, [...] "Bond has just come out of the service and he's a killer. [...] You can see it in their eyes, you know immediately: oh, hello, he's a killer. There's a look. These guys <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> and very subtly they check the perimeters for an exit. That's the sort of thing I wanted." ...|$|E
500|$|Murphy hounded Pat Kiernan {{until he}} got an {{audition}} at Corcadorca, and in September 1996, he made his professional acting debut on the stage, playing {{the part of a}} volatile Cork teenager in Enda Walsh's Disco Pigs. Walsh recalled meeting and discovering Murphy: [...] "There was something about him– he was incredibly enigmatic and he would <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> with real presence and you'd go, [...] "My God". It {{had nothing to do with}} those bloody eyes that everyone's going on about all the time." [...] Murphy observed, [...] "I was unbelievably cocky and had nothing to lose, and it suited the part, I suppose." [...] Originally intended to run for three weeks in Cork, Disco Pigs ended up touring throughout Europe, Canada and Australia for two years, and Murphy left both university and his band. Though he had intended to go back to playing music, he secured representation after his first agent caught a performance of Disco Pigs, and his acting career began to take off.|$|E

2500|$|The brazen {{quality of}} Turner's screen roles was {{reflected}} in her public life. With her deep voice, Turner was often compared to a young Lauren Bacall. When the two met, Turner reportedly introduced herself by saying, [...] "Hi, I'm the young you." [...] In the 1980s, she boasted that [...] "on a night when I feel really good about myself, I can <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>room,</b> and if a man doesn't look at me, he's probably gay." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dennett makes a {{distinction}} between the presence of representation, and the representation of presence. The example he gives regarding this distinction is this: if you were to <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> covered in identical portraits of Marilyn Monroe, you would see that there are many of them, but you would not really be seeing them all at once. There would be no detailed representation of each individual portrait just the knowledge that they are present. Dennet's theory raises two relevant questions: 1) How does the visual system detect change in the environment? 2) How much information is retained in each saccade? The proposed answer to these questions lies in several mechanisms that support a high sensitivity to change in each visual fixation. These mechanisms are: retinal adaptation, [...] "pop-out" [...] systems, and motion detectors. The implication of this view is that little information is needed to be retained between each saccade.|$|E
2500|$|Though a {{successful}} model, the concept {{has been criticized}} for hindering the growth of characters' relationships with other love interests; this has resulted in alternate definitions for the term. In her essay criticism of the term, The Siren Call of the Super Couple (ed. Suzanne Frentz, 1992), Diana Reep describes the love of a supercouple as [...] "so perfect that they are incapable of having romantic feelings for anyone else under any circumstances. In addition, the two have no personal flaws or idiosyncrasies that could interfere with their perfect love. Only an evil, outside force could disturb their relationship". While Days of Our Lives former supervising producer Al Rabin credited the supercouple aspect as the secret to the show's success, his then-executive producer Ken Corday stated, [...] "By definition, supercouple excludes others on the show. Every time they <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>room,</b> every other character, no matter how important, becomes window dressing, I've never believed in it." [...] Corday added, [...] "Either people are involved in a good story or they're not. They're an interesting couple or they're not." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gavin was {{confirmed}} to be Sharon's birth {{father in the}} episode broadcast on 30 October 2015, in which he repeated Sharon's adopted father Den Watts's (Leslie Grantham) iconic line [...] "Hello, princess".

We had the full scripts for the episode, but the other cast members didn't know what was going on. Paul was just fantastic delivering that line." [...] Nicholas said that the [...] "hello, princess" [...] line was used because it was a definite way of linking Gavin and Den. Inside Soap said that Sharon discovering Gavin is her father [...] "has to be the biggest [...] of all" [...] for Sharon, but added that viewers had already guessed before the episode was broadcast. Soaplife thought it was the [...] "most shocking reveal" [...] of 2015 in all British soap operas, saying they were [...] "stunned".

60|$|But, in the meantime, the world's dictum {{was strong}} at Littlebath, and did {{influence}} this dear lady.

It would please her to <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> as a married woman, and to quit herself of that disgrace, which injustice and prejudice, and the folly of her own sex rather than of the other, had so cruelly attached to her present position. And then, to be Lady Bertram! There were but few angels at this time in Littlebath, and Miss Baker was not one of them: she had a taint of vanity in her composition; but we doubt if such female vanity could exist in any human breast in a more pardonable form than it did in hers.|$|E
6000|$|A bright day smiled upon my enterprise, and at ten I {{reported}} {{myself to}} my General, received last instructions and {{no end of}} the sympathetic encouragement which women give, in look, touch, and tone more effectually than in words. The {{next step was to}} get a free pass to Washington, for I'd no desire to waste my substance on railroad companies when [...] "the boys" [...] needed even a spinster's mite. A friend of mine had procured such a pass, and I was bent on doing likewise, though I had to face the president of the railroad to accomplish it. I'm a bashful individual, though I can't get any one to believe it; so it cost me a great effort to poke about the Worcester depot till the right door appeared, then <b>walk</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> containing several gentlemen, and blunder out my request in a high state of stammer and blush. Nothing could have been more courteous than this dreaded President, but it was evident that I had made as absurd a demand as if I had asked for the nose off his respectable face. He referred me to the Governor at the State House, and I backed out, leaving him no doubt to regret that such mild maniacs were left at large. Here was a Scylla and Charybdis business: as if a President wasn't trying enough, without the Governor of Massachusetts and the hub of the hub piled on top of that. [...] "I never can do it," [...] thought I. [...] "Tom will hoot at you if you don't," [...] whispered the inconvenient little voice that is always goading people to the performance of disagreeable duties, and always appeals to the most effective agent to produce the proper result. The idea of allowing any boy that ever wore a felt basin and a shoddy jacket with a microscopic tail, to crow over me, was preposterous, so giving myself a mental slap for such faint-heartedness, I streamed away across the Common, wondering if I ought to say [...] "your Honor," [...] or simply [...] "Sir," [...] and decided upon the latter, fortifying myself with recollections of an evening in a charming green library, where I beheld the Governor placidly consuming oysters, and laughing as if Massachusetts was a myth, and he had no heavier burden on his shoulders than his host's handsome hands.|$|E

Their hearts resonate with ours {{in exactly the same way}} the strings of an unplucked violin vibrate with the sounds of a violin played nearby. Western psychology has documented this phenomenon of 'mood contagion' or limbic resonance. If a person filled with panic or hatred <b>walks</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>room,</b> we feel it immediately, and unless we are very mindful, that person's negative state will begin to overtake our own.

One had to find the owner of the object and ask permission, buy the object with money (called tokens) in a shop, or locate the object in a public area.
