5|$|After her {{training}} {{exercises in the}} Atlantic and the Pacific <b>were</b> <b>finished,</b> New Mexico was overhauled and modernized at the Philadelphia Harbor by the Navy from March 1931 to January 1933. The overhaul included the replacement of her turbo-electric drive with more conventional geared turbines, which were made by Curtis. In addition, New Mexico received eight 5-inch/25 caliber anti-aircraft guns, replacing the four 3-inch/50 caliber guns that had been previously installed. After the overhaul, she returned the Pacific to continue training exercises {{and the development of}} tactical operations.|$|E
5|$|After renovations <b>were</b> <b>finished</b> in 2005, {{the number}} of two- and three-bedroom units was {{increased}} dramatically, due to {{the combination of the}} building's original studio apartments. The larger layouts attracted more families to the cooperative community. In recent years the lobby has been restored, hallways remodeled, and amenities increased, including larger storage areas, a bike room, and an improved laundry facility. The building is now said to be luxurious as measured both by residents' quality of living and by the purchase prices they pay.|$|E

5|$|After {{their first}} {{victory of the}} season, the Flyers were {{challenged}} by the Muncie Offers More AC. The game was labelled as the Muncie City Championship. Since {{most of the other}} local teams' seasons <b>were</b> <b>finished,</b> both Muncie teams hired as many as 20 players for the game. The field was muddy, which caused Offers More AC to fumble the ball several times. In the third quarter, the Flyers scored two touchdowns to give them a 14–0 lead going into the fourth quarter. The Flyers added 10 more points—a touchdown and a field goal—in the final quarter to win the Championship 24–0.|$|E
5|$|All the {{buildings}} around the cloister <b>were</b> <b>finished</b> in the fourteenth century. There were subsequently few major structural changes during the monastic period {{aside from the}} re-vaulting of the south transept of the church {{at the end of}} the fifteenth century. It is likely, however, that there were many internal changes to match the rising standards of living during the later Middle Ages (as seen at Cleeve Abbey) that have left no evidence on the surviving remains.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} forts, the {{garrison}} itself was heavily expanded {{during the initial}} construction years and became the largest garrison in Sweden, taking an exceptional position in Swedish military history of the 20th century; even {{at the start of}} the 21st century, Boden was the largest garrison city in the Swedish Army. Still, no other fortifications than the forts themselves <b>were</b> <b>finished</b> by 1908, and work now started to fill the holes in between them. It was realised that prepared positions were needed for the mobile batteries, and apart from those, three larger battery positions (sometimes called fästen, strongholds) were also constructed at Leåkersberget, Norra Åberget and Svedjeberget. These works were started in 1911 and <b>were</b> <b>finished</b> during the First World War. The last of the three strongholds was positioned in the mountain itself with embrasures in the mountain side, and Leåkersberget had parts of the battery position inside the mountain, but the gun emplacements outsidethe other positions were concrete fortifications above the ground, some inside a bunker and others behind a parapet.|$|E

5|$|As {{the freeways}} in the Lansing area were {{completed}} in the 1960s through the 1980s, the highways through downtown changed designations. The section of I-96 west of Lansing opened in December 1962. In 1973, M-78 was converted to a freeway near the Flint area, and from Olivet southwest of Lansing to the new freeway, the old highway was redesignated Temporary I-69 (Temp. I-69). Additional segments of I-69 north of Lansing <b>were</b> <b>finished</b> in 1984 and 1987. I-69 was routed over I-96 and the new freeway north of Lansing, and the business loop was designated along M-43 and the former Temp. I-69 in 1987 after that second segment opened.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Selby Canal {{began in}} 1775, {{and it was}} opened on 29 April 1778.

Methley cut was completed, but Woodlesford was not, as the company bought the mill there instead. All locks were replaced, and the total cost was over £60,000, of which around £20,000 was for the Selby Canal. The {{navigation}} remained profitable, paying £9,000 in dividends in 1775, which had risen to £32,000 by 1791. Most traffic now used the Selby route, and the transhipment facilities at Airmyn were closed in 1779.|$|E

The first three units <b>were</b> <b>finished</b> in 1945, and delivery was completed the following year. The class was originally numbered 106, but NSB changed the numbering system in 1956, and the class was renumbered to 66. The units consisted of three cars, given the lettering BFM, B and BS. They were numbered 66.01–04, 66.31–34 and 66.61–64, respectively; this numbering system dates from 1970.|$|E

However, the end of World War I and the dissolution of Austria-Hungary left them incomplete until 1920, when three ships <b>were</b> <b>finished</b> for the Regia Marina. An additional five ships were completed for the JKRM in 1931 as the Malinska class.|$|E

The surfaces <b>were</b> <b>finished</b> by painting with a thin coat of mortar and silane to resist further erosion and attack by pollutants. The restoration of the façade revealed much paint adhering to the statues and their niches, indicating that it had once been brightly coloured.|$|E
