5|$|McKnight {{was born}} in Cranbury Township in the colonial Province of New Jersey in 1750. His only sibling was his younger brother, Richard. His father, also named Charles McKnight, emigrated to the colonies from Ireland {{sometime}} around 1740 and was ordained as a Presbyterian minister in 1742. He became a minister of some note, {{and was one of}} the founders and trustees of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). Reverend McKnight opposed British governance in Colonial America and <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> voice for opposition and overthrow of the British government in New Jersey. According to Martha J. Lamb, Reverend McKnight received a severe saber cut to his head in the slashing melee that mortally wounded General Hugh Mercer at the Battle of Princeton. His church at Middletown Point was burned in 1777 and Reverend McKnight was arrested. While in custody aboard the British prison ship HMS Jersey in New York City, Rev. McKnight's health rapidly failed, and he was released shortly before his death on January 1, 1778.|$|E
500|$|Run-D.M.C. rapped {{over the}} most sparse of musical backing tracks. In {{the case of}} [...] "Sucker MCs", there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud,</b> Oberheim DMX drum machine, a few {{scratches}} and nothing else, while the rhymes harangued weak rappers and contrasted them to the group's success. [...] "It's like That" [...] was an aggressively delivered message rap whose social commentary has been defined variously as [...] "objective fatalism", [...] "frustrated and renunciatory", and just plain [...] "reportage". Run-D.M.C. wore street clothes, tracksuits, sneakers, one even wore glasses. Their only possible concession to an image extraneous to that of kids on the street was the stylistic flourish of black fedoras atop their heads. This stood {{in sharp contrast to}} the popular artists of the time, who had variously bedecked themselves with feathers, suede boots, jerri curls, and red or even pink leather suits.|$|E
500|$|Several bonus tracks follow on {{separate}} editions; some continue the teenage theme, {{while others are}} joke tracks. Barker used Afro-Cuban influences for his drum track on [...] "Don't Tell Me It's Over", and DeLonge used something other than his punk influences for [...] "What Went Wrong". [...] While DeLonge felt [...] "staple acoustic songs" [...] were big for groups at the time (such as Green Day's [...] "Good Riddance"), the band wrote all of their songs from their inception on acoustic guitars, and he felt he would rather have [...] "What Went Wrong" [...] in its original form. [...] "You grow up and realize, 'Fuck! Who gives a fuck about punk rock?'" [...] he said. [...] "There are so many great forms of music out there, and you grow beyond wanting to listen to or write something because your parents will hate it." [...] Finn suggested lyrics for the song after viewing a documentary on the first Russian nuclear test; in the film, an aged Soviet physicist says of watching the explosion, [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> boom, and then the bomb began fiercely kicking at the world." ...|$|E

500|$|On January18, 1873, Philadelphia Mint Chief Coiner Archibald Loudon Snowden {{complained that}} the [...] "3" [...] in the date, as struck by the Mint, too closely resembled an [...] "8", {{especially}} on the smaller-sized denominations. [...] In response, Pollock ordered Chief Engraver William Barber to re-engrave the date, opening {{the arms of the}} [...] "3" [...] wider on most denominations, including the three-dollar piece. [...] Both the Closed3 and Open3 varieties are extremely rare, though the official mintage of 25pieces for 1873 is understated, since more specimens than that are known to exist. In 1875 and 1876, no pieces were struck for circulation, with only pieces in proof condition being made available to collectors. [...] The official mintage is 20for 1875 and 45for 1876, though an unknown number of pieces may have been later illicitly restruck for each date. Numismatic writer R.W. Julian believes that there were no later restrikes, but as proof pieces were not counted until sold, employees substituted common-date pieces when unsold coins were to be melted. These pieces had been made available to the public only as part of a proof set of all gold denominations, at a price of $43 (a premium of $1.50 over face value). Julian suggests that the relatively large mintages of almost 42,000 in 1874 and some 82,000 in 1878 were struck in anticipation of the resumption of specie payments, but when this finally occurred at the end of 1878, [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> yawn from the public and the Mint kept most of the pieces on hand, paying them out slowly as stocking stuffers.|$|E
500|$|There were no fatal {{accidents}} at {{the production}} plant, {{although it had}} a higher accident rate than other Manhattan Project production facilities due to the haste to get it into operation. When the crews attempted to start the first rack there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> noise and a cloud of vapor due to escaping steam. This would normally {{have resulted in a}} shutdown, but under the pressure to get the plant operational, the Fercleve plant manager {{had no choice but to}} press on. The plant produced just [...] of 0.852% uranium-235 in October. Leaks limited production and forced shutdowns over the next few months, but in June 1945 it produced [...] In normal operation, [...] of product was drawn from each circuit every 285 minutes. With four circuits per rack, each rack could produce [...] per day. By March 1945, all 21 production racks were operating. Initially the output of S-50 was fed into Y-12, but starting in March 1945 all three enrichment processes were run in series. S-50 became the first stage, enriching from 0.71% to 0.89%. This material was fed into the gaseous diffusion process in the K-25 plant, which produced a product enriched to about 23%. This was, in turn, fed into Y-12, which boosted it to about 89%, sufficient for nuclear weapons. Total S-50 production was [...] It was estimated that the S-50 plant had sped up production of enriched uranium used in the Little Boy bomb employed in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima by a week. [...] "If I had appreciated the possibilities of thermal diffusion," [...] Groves later wrote, [...] "we would have gone ahead with it much sooner, taken a bit more time on the design of the plant and made it much bigger and better. Its effect on our production of U-235 in June and July 1945 would have been appreciable." ...|$|E

Fuel gushed into the cockpit; it began smoking and then I completely lost control of the Bf 109, spiraling down on my back through the Curtisses.

[...] "And once we jumped off the side, there was another explosion to a lesser degree." [...] At the very rear, passengers said they felt only a small jolt.

2500|$|The {{accident}} {{occurred on}} 17 August 2009 at 08:13 local time (00:13 GMT). [...] There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> bang from turbine 2.

[...] As a result, the machinery hall and rooms below its level were flooded. [...] At the same time, an alarm was received at the power station's main control panel, and the power output fell to zero, resulting in a local blackout. The steel gates to the water intake pipes of the turbines, weighing [...] each, were closed manually by opening the valves with hydraulic jacks keeping them up between 8:35 [...] and 9:20 hours [...] (9.30 by official report).|$|E

On November 6, 2007, {{while attending}} {{a meeting at}} Forward Operating Base Wilson, 20 kilometres west of Kandahar City, Mackay was unharmed as two rockets struck the base at about 11 a.m. local time. Mackay described the incident: [...] "There was an explosion. It <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>loud</b> bang", said MacKay. [...] "When it happened, we heard the explosion, we heard the whistle overhead, {{we were told to}} get down and we did." [...] The incident happened {{on the same day that}} a suicide bomber detonated an explosive in Baghlan in the northeastern part of the country killing at least 35 including several politicians. While Taliban insurgents were suspected of being behind the bombing, it was not believed to be related to the attack in Kandahar.|$|E
