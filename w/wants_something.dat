25|$|The {{person who}} is acting in a {{controlling}} way often <b>wants</b> <b>something</b> from the other person that is legitimate to want. They may want to feel loved, safe, valuable, appreciated, supported, needed, etc. This is not the problem. The problem is often {{more a matter of}} how they are going about getting what they want, or that they are insensitive to others needs in doing so that is troubling—and how others react to all of this.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Tako, head of Pacific Pharmaceuticals, is {{frustrated}} with the television shows his company is sponsoring and <b>wants</b> <b>something</b> to boost his ratings. When a doctor tells Tako about a giant monster he discovered on the small Faro Island, Tako believes {{that it would be}} a brilliant idea to use the monster to gain publicity. Tako immediately sends two men, Sakurai and Kinsaburo, to find and bring back the monster. Meanwhile, the American submarine Seahawk gets caught in an iceberg. The iceberg collapses, unleashing Godzilla (who, in the Japanese version, had been trapped within since 1955), who then destroys the submarine and a nearby Arctic military base.|$|E
25|$|When a team {{is willing}} to sign an {{upcoming}} free agent, but the player's current team <b>wants</b> <b>something</b> in return, it {{might be in the}} best interest of both clubs to execute a sign-and-trade deal. This occurs when one team signs one of its free agents and immediately trades that player to another team. A sign-and-trade is beneficial to both the player and the teams; the player receives a bigger contract than he might ordinarily get from a team that he would like to play for, while the trading club gets something in return for a free agent, and the recipient of the trade gets the player they desire. Sign-and-trades are a reality in the NBA because of the CBA's rules: unlike baseball, where teams losing free agents are compensated with draft picks or cash, NBA teams that lose free agents receive no compensation.|$|E

25|$|Isaac Anderson, The New York Times Book Review (January 7, 1940) — There {{is more of}} Archie Goodwin than of Nero Wolfe in this book, {{and that}} is all to the good, for, {{although}} Wolfe is Archie's boss and the one who does the heavy thinking, Archie is, unless our guess is wide of the mark, the person whom readers of the Nero Wolfe stories take to their hearts. If Nero is the brains of the concern, Archie is its arms and hands and legs. When Nero <b>wants</b> <b>something</b> done, he does not need to tell Archie how to do it. Archie will figure that out for himself, and the thing is as good as done, however difficult the assignment may be. In the murder case with which this story deals there are international complications which make things unusually difficult. The police and the G-men are in it too, but the best that they can do is to watch Nero Wolfe and wait for him to come through with the solution. The book is full of surprises for everybody concerned, including not only the reader but also the police, Archie and even Nero Wolfe himself. Read one chapter of this book and you will need no urging to go on with it.|$|E
25|$|In August 2015, the 60th-year {{anniversary of}} the U-2 program, Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works {{revealed}} they were internally developing a successor to the U-2, {{referred to as the}} UQ-2 or RQ-X, combining features from both the manned U-2 and unmanned Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk and improving upon them. Disclosed details say the design is essentially an improved U-2 airframe with the same engine, service ceiling, sensors, and cockpit, with the main differences being an optional manning capability (something Lockheed has proposed for the U-2 to the Air Force several times but has never gained traction) and low-observable characteristics. The Air Force has no requirement or timeframe for a next-generation High-Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) platform, but Lockheed sees a future need and <b>wants</b> <b>something</b> in development early. Having the option of an onboard pilot is considered a deterrent because it can be used in peacetime situations where unmanned aircraft would more likely be engaged, since there is no possibility of killing a person. The company's last attempt to create a stealth unmanned aircraft was the RQ-3 DarkStar, which never made it past flight testing and was canceled. Plans for a U-2 replacement would not conflict with development of the SR-72, another project by the company to create a hypersonic unmanned surveillance plane, as it would be suited for missions that require greater speed for time-sensitive targets.|$|E

500|$|Halloween Town is {{a fantasy}} world filled with {{citizens}} such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, zombies, mummies, vampires, werewolves and witches. Jack Skellington, the [...] "Pumpkin King" [...] {{and leader of}} the town, leads them in organizing the annual Halloween celebrations. However, privately Jack has grown weary of the same routine year after year, and <b>wants</b> <b>something</b> new. Wandering in the woods the morning after Halloween, he stumbles across seven trees containing doors leading to towns representing various holidays, and opens a portal to Christmas Town. Awed by the unfamiliar holiday, Jack returns to Halloween Town to show the residents his findings, but they fail to grasp the idea of Christmas and compare everything to their ideas of Halloween. Jack sequesters himself in his tower to study Christmas {{and find a way to}} rationally explain it, but cannot. He ultimately decides that it's unfair for Christmas Town alone to enjoy the holiday and announces that he and the citizens of Halloween Town will take over Christmas this year.|$|E
500|$|On {{taking office}} as Melter and Refiner, Peale {{implemented}} the changes he had recommended {{based on what}} he had seen in Europe. [...] He also wanted additional mechanization in the mint's Coining Department, headed by Chief Coiner Adam Eckfeldt, whose son Jacob was the Philadelphia Mint's Assayer. Adam Eckfeldt had helped strike some of the first federal coins in 1792 and had been in his office since 1814. [...] Eckfeldt was reluctant to adopt all [...] Peale's recommendations, telling Peale's nephew, engineer George Sellers, [...] "If Mr. Peale had full swing he would turn everything upside down... he <b>wants</b> <b>something</b> better and no doubt he would have it if we were starting anew." [...] As improvements crept in despite Eckfeldt's caution, the Chief Coiner saw their value and became more enthusiastic, noting the savings in working time afforded by the Contamin lathe, which had been imported from France after being seen by Peale there. To help deal with the increased output from the Philadelphia Mint, Peale invented a piling-box, allowing planchets or coins to be quickly stacked, and a counting board, speeding the work of the clerks. The counting board remained in use until the mints installed mechanical counters in 1934.|$|E

When Karl makes a potentially dangerous mistake on a prescription form, Rhys covers for him, but makes it clear he <b>wants</b> <b>something</b> in return. Knowing Karl plays golf with Martin, Rhys asks to join their game so he can try and impress the surgeon. Despite being warned that Martin does not like to talk shop during his golf games, Rhys reveals that he has been following his career and Martin is impressed. Barber explained to a writer for Inside Soap [...] "And Karl {{has no choice but to}} agree that Rhys is a good doctor. It's a bit awkward, because Karl doesn't like the way Rhys operates— so to speak!" [...] Martin grants Rhys an interview for a place on the surgical program; however he forgets everything he knows and makes a fool of himself due to being hungover. Rhys misses out on a place on the program and Barber told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that he is feeling [...] "devastated and desperate." [...] Barber described the position as the Holy Grail for Rhys and because of a stupid act, he has lost it.|$|E

500|$|Among {{the other}} effects ILM had to produce were the {{transporter}} beam and the warp speed effect. Mullen {{noted that the}} effects' look changed depending on who was directing the film; [...] "everyone <b>wants</b> <b>something</b> distinctive, but nobody wants to get {{far enough away from}} the TV series to startle the Trekkies." [...] The effect was produced by cutting out or rotomatting the individual to be transported, then making a vertical slot through which a high-intensity light was positioned. A computer-controlled move would cause the light to spread from the center and fade away, then reset its position and repeat the movement on the opposite side. Handmade acetate filters and gels were applied to give the transporter beam color and patterns, followed by small flickering animated highlights called [...] "bugs" [...] which appeared after the character had dematerialized. The Klingons' transporters were given a harsh red look to differentiate them from the smooth blue Federation effect. Whereas many of the multicolored rainbow warp trail shots from The Wrath of Khan were stock footage taken from the first film, the producers of the third film wanted something new. A streak effect, in which a beauty pass of the ship was combined with blurred passes for each light intensity, was tried first. The result was disappointing; as the Enterprise grew larger the streaks became distorted and out of place. Mullen rejected a straight animation of the warp drive as too bouncy, but the footage was cut in for editing while ILM went through six more approaches to the problem. The final effect, a [...] "vaporous, colorful trail", came together only weeks before the film's release.|$|E

2500|$|The couplet offers {{resistance}} to the reader. The reader <b>wants</b> <b>something</b> like [...] "I thought out love an everlasting day / And yet my trust thou didst, my love, betray." [...] These lines fit {{the spirit of the}} poem. Reading the sonnet with the couplet that Shakespeare wrote leaves the reader uncomfortable. Heather Dubrow claims the speaker is trying to fool himself; he accepts a one moral from the metaphor, that the friend's betrayal is justified by the sun, and neglects the moral the reader has been observing, the friend, like the sun, has been deceptive.|$|E

[...] Instead, it would focus on emotional love. [...] Lines five and six state that the young man who is the object of the poem resides inside the speaker's heart, where he is unseen by the [...] "crystal eyes". [...] The seventh and eighth lines state that the eyes disagree with the heart and argue that they are capable of detecting of the beauty of a person.|$|E

[...] She further wrote, in a list of the [...] "Best Anime of 2015" [...] where DanMachi ranked third, that [...] "the chemistry between the leads, plucky young adventurer Bell Cranel and the goddess Hestia is fantastic, with the warmth of their relationship coming through not only in the animation, but also in the characters' voices. With or without any romance the two make a great pair, and the fact that Hestia clearly <b>wants</b> <b>something</b> more from their relationship than Bell does does not detract from the way the two get along is pretty amazing." [...] Although [...] "the iconic look of the hero's patron goddess, the diminutive-but-stacked Hestia" [...] caught the most attention, [...] "the series also featured an intriguing setting, some unexpectedly-involved character development, great artwork as fantasy series go, and some truly outstanding battle scenes", which resulted in Theron Martin also placing DanMachi onto his list of 2015's best anime, in 5th place.|$|E
