5|$|Concentrating {{solar plants}} in the Mojave Desert have brought up issues of water use, because concentrating solar power plants with wet-cooling systems have high water-consumption intensities {{compared}} to other types of electric power plants; only fossil-fuel plants with carbon-capture and storage may have higher water intensities. A 2013 study comparing various sources of electricity found that the median <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> during operations of concentrating solar power plants with wet cooling was 810 ga/MWhr for power tower plants and 890 gal/MWhr for trough plants. This was higher than the operational <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> (with cooling towers) for nuclear (720 gal/MWhr), coal (530 gal/MWhr), or natural gas (210). A 2011 study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory came to similar conclusions: for power plants with cooling towers, <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> during operations was 865 gal/MWhr for CSP trough, 786 gal/MWhr for CSP tower, 687 gal/MWhr for coal, 672 gal/MWhr for nuclear, and 198 gal/MWhr for natural gas. The Solar Energy Industries Association noted that the Nevada Solar One trough CSP plant consumes 850 gal/MWhr.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, the US Congress {{directed}} the Department of Energy {{to report on}} ways to reduce <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> by CSP. The subsequent report noted that dry cooling technology was available that, although more expensive to build and operate, could reduce <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> by CSP by 91 to 95 percent, bringing their consumption below that of conventional power plants. A hybrid wet/dry cooling system could reduce <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> by 32 to 58 percent. A 2015 report by NREL noted that of the 24 operating CSP power plants in the US, 17 used wet-cooling systems. The four existing CSP plants with dry-cooled systems were the three power plants at the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility near Barstow, California, and the Genesis Solar Energy Project in Riverside County, California. Of 15 CSP projects under construction or development in the US as of March 2015, 6 planned to use wet systems (including one wet system using reclaimed wastewater), 7 planned for dry systems, 1 hybrid, and 1 unspecified.|$|E
5|$|Ambulocetus natans, which lived about 49 {{million years}} ago, was {{discovered}} in Pakistan in 1994. It was probably amphibious, and looked like a crocodile. In the Eocene, ambulocetids inhabited the bays and estuaries of the Tethys Ocean in northern Pakistan. The fossils of ambulocetids are always found in near-shore shallow marine deposits associated with abundant marine plant fossils and littoral molluscs. Although they are found only in marine deposits, their oxygen isotope values indicate that they consumed water {{with a range of}} degrees of salinity, some specimens showing no evidence of sea <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> and others none of fresh <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> at the time when their teeth were fossilized. It is clear that ambulocetids tolerated a wide range of salt concentrations. Their diet probably included land animals that approached water for drinking, or freshwater aquatic organisms that lived in the river. Hence, ambulocetids represent the transition phase of cetacean ancestors between freshwater and marine habitat.|$|E

30|$|Current {{literature}} {{shows that}} <b>water</b> <b>consumptions</b> in primary school are {{generated by the}} combination of the following factors: (1) behaviours of the staff and student; (2) which and how the didactic activity develops; (3) the services and utilities present in the school (refectory, gardens, swimming pool, etc.) and, finally; (4) the level of the hydraulic infrastructures both in terms of water saving and presence of harvesting and reuse schemes (Almeida et al. 2014; Cheng and Hong 2004; Farina et al. 2011, 2013).

5|$|Coropuna is drained by deep gorges, {{with water}} {{eventually}} reaching the Arma and Majes rivers, {{both of which}} empty into the Pacific Ocean. During the dry season, Coropuna's glaciers are {{a major source of}} water for the region, and concern has been raised that their disappearance may result in water shortages at a time when population growth has increased <b>water</b> <b>consumption</b> and begun to create conflict over water distribution. 30,000 people depend on the Coropuna glacier in one way or the other, 8,000 of them just for their water supply.|$|E
5|$|This fungus is inedible, as it {{contains}} the toxic compound gyromitrin, which when digested is metabolized into monomethylhydrazine, {{a major component}} of rocket fuel. Although much of the gyromitrin may be removed by parboiling with generous volumes of <b>water,</b> <b>consumption</b> is not advisable due to possible long-term health effects—there is evidence that even small doses of gyromitrin may have a cumulative carcinogenic effect.|$|E
5|$|Another example, is the Junta Administradora del Acueducto La Sirena en el Valle del Cauca (Water Board La Sirena) in {{the southwestern}} {{outskirts}} of Cali, which manages 778 residential connections, offering continuous service to some 4,200 users. It operates a sewerage system and a wastewater treatment plant. <b>Water</b> <b>consumption</b> is metered. The average monthly tariff is US$3.5 for 28m3. There is no social stratification, but special tariffs are applied to those users who consume more than 28m3. The annual cash surplus is about US$10,000 which is reinvested in preventive maintenance {{and in some cases}} in construction works. In this way, in the last 3years a water capture facility was constructed in Quebrada Epaminondas, another one at Melendez River was improved, and a water tank with a capacity of 220m3 was constructed.|$|E

30|$|Referring to {{students}} (see Fig.  5 a, c), the median of <b>water</b> <b>consumptions</b> “purified” by losses (see mark C) was as follows: 7.9 and 7.2  L/day/student considering all the experimentation data and all data {{with the exception}} of the outlier, respectively. Furthermore, differently from Almeida et al. (2014) and Farina et al. (2011), the interquartile range was very small highlighting how 50  % of the observations were concentrated around the medians. Also referring {{to students}} (see Fig.  5 a, c), the median of <b>water</b> <b>consumptions</b> “inclusive” of losses (see mark D) was as follows: 14.2 and 13.6  L/day/student considering all the experimentation data and all data {{with the exception of}} the outlier, respectively.

5|$|The {{class was}} heavily used by British Railways: 29 {{locomotives}} required replacement cylinders between 1955 and 1961 due to excessive wear. Frames were occasionally replaced due to stress caused by heavy use, and the steam circuit was revised when new cylinders were fitted: the inside steam pipes of Maunsell's original design {{were replaced by}} outside steam pipes emerging from the smokebox, behind the smoke deflectors. From 1957, some of the locomotives had larger-diameter BR Standard Class4 chimneys fitted to improve draughting with poor-quality coal, though the decline of steam on the Southern Region precluded use on the entire class. Crew reports maintained that the latter modifications cut fuel and <b>water</b> <b>consumption.</b> The final set of modifications constituted the fitting of new injectors and Automatic Warning System (AWS) equipment in 1957 and 1959 respectively.|$|E

Significant differences were observed in the amount of energy and water used. The annual space heating consumptions differentiated by a factor of 2. 2 per square metre of floor area. Hot water heating demands varied by a factor of 3. 5 per square metre of floor area or by 2. 5 per person per year.
