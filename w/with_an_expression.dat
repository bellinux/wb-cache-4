5|$|Shortly {{after her}} {{conversation}} with Emma, Mary Margaret Blanchard volunteers at Storybrooke Hospital, placing flowers {{at the bedside}} of patients. She stops in the ICU where a John Doe (Dallas), Prince Charming, is sleeping in a coma. Mary Margaret is unaware of who he is. Meanwhile, at the Mayor's home, Regina takes the book from Henry's room and goes downstairs {{to look at her}} mirror, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> that seems to acknowledge she is aware of her fairy tale existence.|$|E
25|$|Chung Keng Kwee, when {{reminded}} of the Larut Wars by an inquiring visitor, dismissed the subject <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of distaste - 'Banyak rugi!' (meaning 'Big loss!) -- see The Protected Malay States: 1874-1895.|$|E
25|$|Despite being {{strictly}} {{constrained by}} his constitutional position, he also issued several wide-ranging statements of remorse to Asian countries, for their suffering under Japanese occupation, beginning <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of remorse to China made in April 1989, {{three months after}} the death of his father, Emperor Shōwa.|$|E

25|$|Gyges and {{all present}} {{withdraw}} from Nisia's body. A blue sky appears {{and in a}} diamond temple, Venus is seen surrounded by cupids. The jealous goddess, <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of triumph, points to Nisia's lifeless body, as if to warn {{those who seek to}} rival the goddess of eternal beauty.|$|E
25|$|Individual laments {{lamenting the}} fate of the {{particular}} individual who utters them. They are by far {{the most common type of}} psalm. They typically open with an invocation of Yahweh, followed by the lament itself and pleas for help, and often ending <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of confidence. A subset is the psalm of confidence, in which the psalmist expresses confidence that God will deliver him from evils and enemies.|$|E
25|$|The {{report said}} that the {{democratic}} will of the Puerto Rican people was paramount for the future status of the territory. It suggested any change should begin <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> from the people of Puerto Rico on whether to maintain current territorial status or establish a permanent non-territorial status {{with regard to the}} United States. It recommended that the will of people be ascertained in a way to provide clear guidance for future action by Congress.|$|E
60|$|The doctor {{scrutinized}} his own remarks <b>with</b> <b>a</b> judicious <b>expression.</b>|$|R
60|$|Bobby {{said this}} <b>with</b> such <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of serious anxiety that his little friend was quite touched.|$|R

500|$|Hatt-ı hümayuns on {{the white}} were more {{elaborate}} and some may have been drafted by a scribe before being penned by the Sultan. They often started by addressing the recipient. The Sultan would refer to his grand vizier as [...] "My Vizier", or if his grand vizier was away at war, would refer to his deputy as [...] "Ka'immakâm Paşa". Those written to other officials would often start <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> like [...] "You who are my Vizier of Rumeli, Mehmed Pasha" [...] ("Sen ki Rumili vezîrim Mehmed Paşa'sın"). The head of religious affairs (Şeyhülislam) or the Sultan's personal tutor would be addressed simply and respectfully. In cases where the hatt-ı hümayun was to be delivered ceremoniously, with an imperial sword and a cloak, as in an appointment to a high rank, {{there would be a}} flowery salutation such as [...] "after I have honored you with my glorious greeting you should know that..." [...] (seni selâm-ı şâhanemle teşrif eylediğimden sonra malumun ola ki...). Correspondence to a military commander could have a lengthy and ornate salutation or just address him by his title. A note without an address was meant for the grand vizier or his deputy.|$|E
500|$|The album's artwork {{was taken}} from a shoot by fashion {{photographer}} Mario Testino, in which Madonna modelled Versace clothes for their upcoming Fall/Winter 1995 campaign. Subsequently, other images taken from the shoot appeared in fashion magazines, such as Vanity Fair and Vogue Italia. The packaging included with the release showed Madonna looking [...] "deliciously cosmopolitan" [...] as she wore a tight-fit white cocktail attire, while the back cover artwork is predominantly more playful. The front cover artwork presented Madonna leaning against a wall <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of [...] "romantic loss or absorption." [...] Designed as the Madonna album which would appeal to a larger audience in contrast to her previous records, Bedtime Stories and [...] Erotica, the booklet featured red roses inside and a golden yellow flower on the back cover. According to The Guardian writer Caroline Sullivan, the fact that Madonna removed her nose ring for the cover shot indicated she [...] "wants the album to be taken on its own merits." [...] In 2013, the artwork was dubbed {{as one of the}} [...] "20 Most Fashionable Album Covers Ever" [...] by the Dutch edition of Elle magazine. The title of the album derives from her 1990 song of the same name since it had received little attention during the release of its original album, I'm Breathless.|$|E
500|$|Grant's {{appeal was}} unusually broad, among {{both men and}} women; Kael remarked that men wanted to be him and women dreamed of dating him. She noticed that Grant treated his female co-stars {{differently}} {{to most of the}} leading players at the time, regarding them as subjects with multiple qualities rather than [...] "treating them as sex objects". For writer David Shipman, he seemed to meet the requirement for every figure to aspire to be, whether it was an uncle, best friend or lover, and [...] "more than most stars he belonged to the public". A number of critics have argued that Grant had the rare star ability to turn a mediocre picture into a good one. Philip T. Hartung of The Commonweal in his review for Mr. Lucky (1943) stated that if it [...] "weren't for Cary Grant's persuasive personality the whole thing would melt away to nothing at all". For McCann Hollywood had [...] "found its ideal gentleman, a gentleman for a democratic culture. He was an amalgam of tradition and modernity, wealth and virtue, elite and mass, high and low, great and good". He states that Grant's delivery should [...] "not have worked, but somehow it did", commenting: [...] "As he sits and faces the camera during that early scene in The Awful Truth, he looks at us <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> that suggests he knows as well as we do that the audacious trick has, against all the odds, actually come off. He smiles at us, sharing with us his extraordinary good fortune. He smiles a smile like Gatsby's smile." [...] Political theorist C. L. R. James saw Grant as a [...] "new and very important symbol", a new type of Englishman who differed from the Leslie Howard and Ronald Coleman gentleman types, who represented the [...] "freedom, natural grace, simplicity and directness which characterise such different American types as Jimmy Stewart and Ronald Reagan", which ultimately symbolized the growing relationship between Britain and America.|$|E

2500|$|Visual {{identification}} of local artifacts, such as printing or washing defects, may likewise suggest {{the removal of}} individual spots. This can take {{a substantial amount of}} time depending on the quality of array manufacture. [...] In addition, some procedures call for the elimination of all spots <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> value below a certain intensity threshold.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are also}} {{other types of}} {{extensions}} of the above computations which are possible. [...] They started <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of the primed image coordinates and derived 3D coordinates in the unprimed system. [...] It is also possible to start with unprimed image coordinates and obtain primed 3D coordinates, which finally can be transformed into unprimed 3D coordinates. [...] Again, in the ideal case the result should be equal to the above expressions, but in practice they may deviate.|$|E
2500|$|In the 18th century, François-Marie Arouet {{adopted the}} mononym Voltaire, for both {{literary}} and personal use, in 1718 after his imprisonment in Paris' Bastille, to mark {{a break with}} his past. The new name combined several features. It was an anagram for a Latinized version of his family surname, [...] "Arouet, l j"; it reversed the syllables {{of the name of}} a family château, Airvault; and it has implications of speed and daring through similarity to French expressions such as [...] "voltige", [...] "volte-face" [...] and [...] "volatile". [...] "Arouet" [...] would not have served the purpose, given that name's associations with [...] "roué" [...] and <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> that meant [...] "for thrashing".|$|E
2500|$|The 170-ton statue is {{composed}} of 28blocks of white Georgia marble (Georgia Marble Company) and rises [...] from the floor, including the [...] seated figure (with armchair and footrest) upon an [...] high pedestal. The figure of Lincoln gazes directly ahead and slightly down <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of gravity and solemnity. His frock coat is unbuttoned, and a large United States flag is draped over the chair back and sides. French paid special attention to Lincoln's expressive hands, which rest on the enormous arms of a circular, ceremonial chair, the fronts of which bear fasces, emblems of authority from Roman antiquity. French used casts of his own fingers to achieve the correct placement.|$|E

2500|$|For {{the evenings}} {{of the three}} festivals (shalosh regalim) the old London {{tradition}} has preserved, from at least the early 18th century, three characteristic melodies, probably brought from north Germany or Bohemia. That for the Passover illustrates the old custom according to which the precentor solemnly dwells on the last creed, that on {{the resurrection of the}} dead (in this case to a [...] "representative" [...] theme common to Passover and to Purim), and is answered by the choristers <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of confident assurance. The choral response here given received its final shaping from David Mombach. The [...] "Yigdal" [...] for Shavu`oth is of a solemn tone, thus strikingly contrasting with those for the other festivals.|$|E
2500|$|The Lord President of the Supreme Court, Tun Salleh Abas, was {{pressured}} by his fellow judges {{to respond to}} the government's actions. Salleh decided to convene a meeting of all 20 judges from the Supreme and High Courts in the capital of Kuala Lumpur. At the meeting, they agreed not to publicly reply to Mahathir's criticisms. Instead, they wrote a confidential letter to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King) and the Malay rulers, expressing their grievances. The proposed letter, which was unanimously approved, was written by Salleh Abas. The letter stated the judges' disappointment [...] "with the various comments and accusations made by the Honourable Prime Minister against the Judiciary," [...] but did not demand specific action be taken — instead, it ended <b>with</b> <b>an</b> <b>expression</b> of [...] "hope that all those unfounded accusations will be stopped".|$|E
