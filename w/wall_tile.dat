5|$|The pre-1980 subway {{stations}} of the Bloor–Danforth line follow a two-colour background and trim theme and use the unique Toronto Subway font on the stations' walls. The tiling theme {{was influenced by the}} Broad Street Subway in Philadelphia and used a cycle that was similar to the design employed on the Yonge subway. This design consists of two colours for the tiles, one for main wall tiles and another for trim tiles near the ceiling of the stations. The station names on the main wall tiles use the colour of the trim tiles and vice versa, except that some of the station names of the trim tiles are white instead of the main <b>wall</b> <b>tile</b> colour for readability.|$|E

2500|$|This {{station has}} four tracks and two island platforms, {{and is the}} {{geographically}} easternmost (railroad southern) express station on the IND Fulton Street Line. It has the same 10" [...] × 5" [...] eggshell-beige <b>wall</b> <b>tile</b> as the next three stations west (railroad north), in contrast to typical IND white square tiles. The tile band, however, is a delicate shade of lilac with a violet border, similar to Delancey Street in Manhattan. The I-beams are tiled with color bands and mini-vertical name tablets reading [...] "Euclid," [...] along with the two-tone border motif. The I-beams are in pairs {{at the center of}} the platforms; towards each end the platforms narrow and there is a single row of these I-beams. A crew quarters room is over the railroad south end of both platforms. The station has a crossover in the mezzanine along with an active newsstand and elevators to both platforms.|$|E

5000|$|In 1905, Owens Pottery {{began making}} tiles, and this line quickly grew to {{dominate}} production, {{with the result}} that the Zanesville Tile Company was incorporated to handle this end of the business. Around 1907 Owens sold most of his stake in both companies, only to buy them back by 1909 after other investors pushed the tile business into receivership. Shortly thereafter, he set up a new company, J. B. Owens Floor & <b>Wall</b> <b>Tile,</b> with a new factory across the street from his former operations. For a few years the new company made both art pottery and tiles, but within a few years it stopped producing art pottery altogether. The company name was changed again, to the Empire Floor and <b>Wall</b> <b>Tile</b> Company. Owens also had stakes in other ceramic companies in Ohio and New Jersey, and he was awarded over 20 patents, most of them related to the design for a tunnel kiln. [...] The Empire factory burned in 1928 and Owens effectively went out of business the following year, though his companies were involved in lawsuits for several more decades.|$|E
