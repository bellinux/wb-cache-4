He was orphaned at a young age, and moved to Islington to be raised by his two sisters, who ran a school there. They raised him as though he <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>child</b> of their own. The income from the school allowed them to live a comfortable lifestyle. He was taught by Henry Butter, a well-respected author who had written a much-read treatise on teaching spelling.
