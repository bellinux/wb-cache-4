40|$|In {{industrial}} practice, it {{is often}} required that <b>weighting</b> <b>tables</b> were prepared in advance and tristimulus values can then be directly computed using summation of {{the products of the}} weights and measured reflectance values. The CIE has never provided precise procedure to calculate the <b>weighting</b> <b>tables,</b> and various discrepant methods have been used. Hence it is possible to obtain significantly different tristimulus values from the same set of spectral data. In order to overcome this problem, the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM Intl.) has published two sets of <b>weighting</b> <b>tables</b> known as Table 5 and Table 6 respectively. Each set includes 36 <b>weighting</b> <b>tables</b> covering 9 illuminants and two standard colorimetric observers at two wavelength intervals (10 -nm and 20 -nm). The <b>weighting</b> <b>tables</b> of Table 5 must be used with the reflectance corrected using the Steams and Steams (SS) method, and <b>weighting</b> <b>tables</b> of Table 6 must be used with the measured reflectance values without the SS correction. In practice, the illuminant used may be different from the CIE standard illuminants and users have to prepare their own <b>weighting</b> <b>tables</b> corresponding to the illuminant actually used. ASTM Intl. E 2022 - 99 provided a standard calculation method to generate <b>weighting</b> <b>tables</b> of Table 5 for a non-standard illuminant. No standard procedure is given to calculate <b>weighting</b> <b>tables</b> of Table 6 since it consisted of Venable and Steams correction weights, and the Venable optimum weight is computed by an iterative procedure. In this artical, we will report some recent progress in generating weighting tables; compare the performances among the <b>weighting</b> <b>tables</b> such as ASTM Intl. Tables of Table 5 and <b>Table</b> 6, Optimum <b>weighting</b> <b>tables,</b> Least Square <b>weighting</b> <b>tables,</b> and Direct selection tables; quantify the possible colorimetric errors for each of the tables; and finally recommend for standardization of a method for generating <b>weighting</b> <b>tables.</b> Int Commiss Opt, Chinese Opt Soc, Changchun Inst Opt, Fine Mech & Phys, CAS, AFOSR Asia Off, Chinese Acad Engn, Chinese Acad Sci & Technol, European Opt Soc, IEEE LEOS, Natl Nat Sci Fdn China, Opt Soc Japan, Opt Soc Korea, Opt Soc Russia, Siberian, Opt Soc Amer, SPI...|$|R

The index is statistically very limited in usefulness as covered a very limited demographic of people who were able to afford life insurance and who were mostly white.|$|E
50|$|The game {{begins with}} the protagonist inheriting a mansion from his {{recently}} deceased aunt but unknown to him, it is haunted by four ghosts called Gizzy, Wuzzy, ZingZong, and Struke. In order to banish these ghosts forever, he has to collect eight music boxes and carry them to the exit. Once they're all assembled, they will play Chopin's Funeral March thus winning the game. The protagonist enters the mansion at 11:50pm and his first task is to set the clocks back before they strike midnight and all the ghosts rise. He then has to hunt around the mansion avoiding the various traps and haunted rooms. If the protagonist does encounter a ghost, he can throw a heavy object (such as a bed, heavy <b>weight,</b> <b>table)</b> at the ghost to stun it.|$|E
5000|$|Physical {{measurements}} of the sled are taken, and {{the temperature of the}} sled's steel blades is checked and may not be more than 5 °C above that of a previously established control temperature. Additionally, for artificial track races the athlete must first be weighed. This is to determine if the athlete is entitled to carry extra weight on their body while sliding. Men may use additional weight amounting to 75% of the difference between body weight and a base weight of 90 kg. Women may use additional weight amounting to 50% of the difference between body weight and a base weight of 70 kg. Doubles athletes may use additional weight amounting to 50% of the difference between body weight and a base weight of 90 kg. Additional weight is not allowed if the body weight of the front person and back person together exceeds 180 kg. If one of the partners weighs more than 90 kg, the weight exceeding the 90 kg mark is added to the lighter partner. If there should still be a difference between the partner’s weight and the 90 kg mark, the difference can be compensated according to an official <b>weight</b> <b>table.</b> Between runs athletes are randomly selected for additional weight checks. Before each run the sled (with the athlete, for artificial track races) is weighed at the start ramp.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundTo {{identify}} {{the impact of}} <b>weight,</b> <b>table</b> surface, and table type on slipping in a simulation of minimally invasive gynecologic surgery. MethodsA mannequin was placed into increasing Trendelenburg until a slip was observed; the table angle {{at the time of}} the event was measured (slip angle). The influence of mannequin position (supine vs. lithotomy), <b>weight,</b> <b>table</b> surface, and model was evaluated. A linear regression model was used to analyze the data. ResultsMannequin weight, bed surface, and bed type all significantly impacted the slip angles. In general, higher mannequin weights tolerated significantly more Trendelenburg before slipping in the supine position but less in lithotomy compared to lower weights. In lithotomy, the disposable sheet and gelpad performed worse than the bean bag, egg crate foam, and bedsheet. There was no difference in slipping because of bed surface in the supine model. The Skytron operating table performed significantly better than the Steris operating table when tested with the bedsheet. ConclusionOperative position, patient weight, and bed surface together influence the slipping propensity. In lithotomy, heavier patients were more prone to slipping while the inverse was true in supine. The egg crate foam, bean bag, and bedsheet were the best antislip surfaces. Operating room table choice can mitigate slippage...|$|E

30|$|For {{adaptive}} routing in WisperNet-Space, we use an MST-Steiner heuristic {{to solve the}} SMT problem. All active nodes periodically send the PDRs for all their active links to the gateway. After receiving a link's weight, the gateway updates its <b>weight</b> <b>table</b> for all existing links in the network. Since the PDR is not defined for inactive (not used) links, these links keep same weights as they had prior to activation of the present network topology. Their weights cannot be reset to zero, since that would allow some heavily jammed links to become competitive for network routing right in next iteration.|$|E
