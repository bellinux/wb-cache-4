500|$|England won the Test series 3–2 {{after winning}} the first, second and fourth games. In the first match Rhodes contributed 40 runs to a tenth wicket {{partnership}} of 130 with R. E. Foster, who scored 287, to assist the team in building a large lead. This was a Test record partnership for the tenth wicket, and remained so for 70 years; until 2014, it was a record for England's 10th wicket. When Victor Trumper led an Australian fightback, scoring 185 not out, only Rhodes could slow his scoring in conditions which, according to Warner, were very good for batting. Steady bowling through the innings brought Rhodes figures of five for 94; Warner wrote: [...] "what <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> without Rhodes I do not know".|$|E
500|$|A planned film {{adaption}} of Year Zero {{became a}} television project in 2007. Reznor met with various writers and pitched {{the idea to}} television networks. The 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike affected the pre-production stage. Nevertheless, Reznor commented in 2008 that the project is [...] "still churning along", {{and that he had}} begun working with American film producer Lawrence Bender. In 2010, Reznor started developing the Year Zero miniseries with HBO and BBC Worldwide Productions. Reznor and Bender collaborated with Carnivàle writer Daniel Knauf to create the science fiction epic. When asked about the miniseries during an [...] "Ask Me Anything" [...] session on Reddit on November 13, 2012, Reznor said it was [...] "currently in a holding state" [...] and explained, [...] "We [...] didn't find the right match with a writer, and really have been avoiding doing what <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> from the beginning: write it ourselves. [...] This project {{means a lot to me}} and will see the light of day in one form or another." [...] In 2017, during an interview promoting new Nine Inch Nails EP Add Violence, Reznor said that [...] "They got so far as hiring a writer for it, but then it fell to shit because we never had the right writer. I should have just done it [...]" ...|$|E

2500|$|While {{the return}} to 2D had been met with high praise, the {{characters}} were modeled in 3D and then pre-rendered and saved in 2D sprites rather than being hand-drawn 2D sprites, which was initially met with mixed reception from fans. Cecil explained that the game was in full HD in order achieve the highest visual quality possible, but the original animations from The Shadow of the Templars and The Smoking Mirror were created in 640×400; a move to HD would require animations three times larger, and hand-animating so many pixels might be possible, but would be a [...] "massively complicated job." [...] To further quote Cecil, [...] "The massive advantage of rendering and then modelling is that obviously the data is much more manageable, we can connect animations much more smoothly, {{we can continue to}} tweak to optimise the 2D look which we’re in the process of doing, and you can hand-touch them at the end. A lot of people have said that we should be doing 2D, and I totally respect their comments, but my opinion is that it’s just not feasible. I’m also very pleased with the way the sprites are looking anyway. What we probably need to do is communicate that the end result is they look like they’re sprites, they look like they’re 2D. So I don’t regret the decision at all, and I’m absolutely convinced it’s the right one. I just don’t think we’ve communicated as well as <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> that the end results will look like cartoony 2D sprites." [...] He also stated that 2D and 3D in HD brings the [...] "best of every world." [...] Technology written specifically to give the sprites a more [...] "cartoony" [...] look was written.|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no {{particular}} credit about the management," [...] Chris said; [...] "we acted just as <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> had we been stalking {{a herd of}} deer instead of a party of Boers. One always manages, if possible, to put a party on the line by which {{they are likely to}} take flight, before crawling up within shot. If we could have taken our horses down with us before we opened fire <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so, and being so well mounted, I think few of them would have got away; but we could not manage it without risking being seen, and in that case the Boers, on making out what our strength was, would certainly have shown fight; and even if we had beaten them, which I don't suppose <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> we should have suffered heavily." ...|$|E

60|$|Hence we can {{see that}} when a plant or animal is placed in a new country, among new competitors, the {{conditions}} of its life will generally be changed in an essential manner, although the climate may be exactly the same as in its former home.
