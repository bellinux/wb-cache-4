40|$|Steinmanella Crickmay (Bivalvia, Trigonioidea) is an abundantly {{recorded}} genus {{from the}} Tithonian-Barremian of the Neuquén Basin, Argentina. A {{number of species}} have been described from different localities and units, but a precise stratigraphic chart at the species level is still wanting. Here we report three coeval species from the top Vaca Muerta Formation in central and northern Neuquén Province from the ammonoid zones Neocomites wichmanni and Lissonia riveroi of Early Valanginian age. Material was collected, from north to south, in the following sections: Pampa Tril, Puerta Curaco and Cerrito de la Ventana, comprising specimens of Steinmanella curacoensis (<b>Weaver),</b> <b>S.</b> neuquensis (Burckhardt) and <b>S.</b> quintucoensis (<b>Weaver).</b> <b>S.</b> quitucoensis has a rectangular outline, a wide antecarinal furrow and prominent tubercles in the flank ribs. S. neuquensis presents a quadrangular outline, a straight dorsal margin in a 90 º angle to the anterior margin and well-defined carinae. S. curacoensis has an oval outline, an inflated shell, poorly marked carinae and numerous flank ribs. S. quintucoensis was recorded in all the studied localities and is dominant at Cerrito de la Ventana. S. neuquensis and S. curacoensis were found only in Cerrito de la Ventana and Puerta Curaco. In the latter, S. curacoensis dominates the assemblage, while S. neuquensis is in both localities represented by a few specimens. All species are commonly found in black shales {{as well as in}} calcareous shales, along with other bivalves and ammonoids, and preservation is quite variable, some specimens being highly weathered (particularly in Puerta Curaco) while others remain almost pristine. Some were collected from thin storm-deposited packstones in Cerrito de la Ventana. The studied association represents a stratigraphic link between the Tithonian records of Steinmanella from the Picún Leufú Formation and the Late Valanginian to Hauterivian records from the Agrio Formation.

The {{version of}} record is {{available}} online at: [URL] {{aim of this}} study was to use in vitro nail models to investigate the potential of a novel base formulation (Recura) containing either fluconazole or miconazole for the treatment of onychomycosis in comparison to two commercial comparators (Jublia and a Penlac generic). Initially, a modified Franz cell was used, where sections of human nail served as the barrier through which drug penetrated into an agar-filled chamber infected with dermatophytes. A second study was performed using a novel infected nail model where dermatophytes grew into human nail and adenosine triphosphate levels were used as biological marker for antimicrobial activity. The novel enhancing system Recura increased the permeation of both existing drugs through human nail sections mounted in a modified Franz cell. Furthermore, the infected nail model also confirmed that the system also enhanced the permeation through infected nail resulting in a decrease in adenosine triphosphate levels superior (P ??? 0. 05) to Penlac generic and equivalent (P > 0. 05) to the commercial comparator Jublia. This study demonstrated that with the use of a novel permeation-enhancing formulation base, Recura enhances delivery of miconazole and fluconazole when applied ungually such that the efficacy was equivalent or superior to commercial comparators. Such a topically applied system has the possibility of overcoming the systemic side effects of antifungals when taken orally...|$|R

40|$|Optical links are a {{promising}} {{alternative to the}} electrical interconnects that are currently used between chips within a computer. A crucial part of an optical link is a modulator, a device that converts an electrical signal into an optical signal. This thesis explores the physics of how these modulators operate. I built a general purpose optical and electrical testing station to perform these measurements. The optical transmission spectra of the set of modulators studied had extinction ratios {{in the range of}} 5 to 27 dB, which is sufficient for modulation. I developed analytical and T-Matrix models to extract physical parameters from the transmission scans, such as light transmission, loss in the ring, and index of refraction of the contact section. The modulators worked with an open eye up to frequencies of 600 MHz. A theoretical model was developed to match the data and experiment with injection and recombination dynamics. Finally, several design solutions are suggested to further improve the modulators and to move towards the goal of modulators that operate at 5 Gb/s. by Matthew J. <b>Weaver.</b> Thesis (<b>S.</b> B.)

40|$|In {{the last}} four decades of the past century Mexico created {{increasingly}} more comprehensive policies for forest management. Yet, mismanagement and environmental degradation continued with no great improvement in production or efficiency. Some of the reasons include poor enforcement of existing laws and regulations, an unwieldy and centralized bureaucracy, regulations that favor short-range plans and investments, and an economy that cannot support sufficient budgets for high-minded plans and utopian ideologies. The results of this pattern of forest management have been damage to the environment, inadequate forest production, an impoverished indigenous and rural people, and a poor export economy. The general subject of this paper has been addressed in other places.

40|$|Published online 25 February 2016 Increasing {{evidence}} that the maternal environment influences the programming of developing embryos and fetuses through epigenetic mechanisms has significant potential application in the broiler industry. The broiler breeder hen is subjected to restricted-feeding regimes to maximise egg quantity and quality, but the genetically high-intake potential of these birds makes this regime a stressful one. We propose that this stress is signalled to the developing embryo via changes in yolk composition as an evolutionary adaptation to changing environments, and that exposure {{to high levels of}} corticosteroids in ovo is associated with developmental reprogramming, which has effects on the behaviour, health and growth of the progeny. The present paper describes some preliminary results from a series of trials designed to elucidate the relationship between breeder hen diet and egg composition, and the growth, behaviour and immune function of the progeny. We conclude that manipulation of the breeder hen diet is an untapped opportunity to maintain the competitiveness of the chicken meat industry and further, that achieving improved productivity by this means may be compatible with improved animal welfare outcomes for the hen and her progeny.

Nevertheless, close examination of its immunophenotypic profile by mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) and potential relationship between antigens, as well as histologic grade, has not been extensively assessed by flow cytometry immunophenotyping (FC). We examined the immunophenotypic profile, including heavy and light chain analysis, of 41 nodal FL cases with FC analysis and tissue diagnosis. Additionally, MFI of CD 45, CD 19, CD 20, CD 22, and CD 10 were examined. The relationship between the antigen expression on FL cells and normal B cells in the same sample, and any association with each other or with histologic grade, were analyzed statistically. We observed brighter CD 45 and CD 20 expression in FL than normal B cells (P < 0. 0001); dimmer CD 19 in FL than normal B cells (P = 0. 03); brighter CD 20 in grade 2 than grade 1 histology (P = 0. 0023). No correlation was observed between CD 10 MFI and other antigens. Increased expression of CD 20, CD 45, and dim expression of CD 19 are features of nodal FL. FC assessment of MFI detects subtle changes in antigen expression not entirely apparent by visual examination of dot plots or immunohistochemistry.

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{structure of}} human {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} has been refined to a crystallographic residual of 16. 1 % at 1. 6 A resolution. The structure has a Kunitz-type fold and {{is composed of}} 12 antiparallel beta-strands, 6 of which form a beta-barrel. One bound sulfate ion has been identified in the model, hydrogen bonded to the side chains of Asn 27, Arg 120, and Lys 125. The side chain of Arg 120 has two conformations, both of which permit hydrogen bonds to the sulfate. This sulfate binding site has been suggested as the binding site for heparin (Eriksson, A. E., Cousens, L. <b>S.,</b> <b>Weaver,</b> L. H., & Matthews, B. W., 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88, 3441 - 3445). Two beta-mercaptoethanol (BME) molecules are also included in the model, each forming a disulfide bond to the S gamma atoms of Cys 69 and Cys 92, respectively. The side chain of Cys 92 has two conformations of which only one can bind BME. Therefore the BME molecule is half occupied at this site. The locations of possible sulfate binding sites on the protein were examined by replacing the ammonium sulfate in the crystallization medium with ammonium selenate. Diffraction data were measured to 2. 2 A resolution and the structure refined to an R-factor of 13. 8 %. The binding of the more electron-dense selenate ion was identified at two positions. One position was identical to the sulfate binding site identified previously. The second selenate binding site, which is of lower occupancy, is situated 5. 6 A from the first. This ion is hydrogen bonded by the side chain of Lys 135 and Arg 120. Thus the side chain of Arg 120 binds two selenate ions simultaneously. It is suggested that the observed second selenate binding site should also be considered as a possible binding site for heparin, or that both selenate binding sites might simultaneously contribute to the binding of heparin...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the need for a}} pointcut for parallelizable loops in an aspect-oriented programming environment. Several prototype solutions exist for loop pointcuts, but the solutions are not very granular. In particular, they are not able to differentiate between loops that are parallelizable and those that are not. Being able to identify parallelizable loops automatically, as part of an aspect-oriented compiler 2 ̆ 7 s weaving process, is particularly important because (1) manually identifying parallelizable loops is known to be a difficult problem and (2) aspectizing parallelized loops can lead to a reduction in code tangling and an increase in separation of concerns. This paper describes the concepts behind the loop-pointcut problem. It then describes the approach used in this study for implementing a solution {{in the form of an}} aspect-oriented Java compiler with a parallelizable loop pointcut. Identifying parallelizable loops is known to be a difficult problem, and as such, this study 2 ̆ 7 s parallelizable loop pointcut implements a heuristic solution. The pointcut identifies many parallelizable loops as being parallelizable, but in erring on the side of conservatism, there are some parallelizable loops that the pointcut is unable to identify as parallelizable. To test the parallelizable-loop pointcut, the pointcut was applied to a benchmark set of parallelizable programs. There were two versions of each benchmark program - (1) an aspect-oriented version, where the aspect-oriented compiler 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>weaver</b> added the multi-threading functionality, and (2) a non-aspect-oriented version, where the benchmark program 2 ̆ 7 s source code directly implemented the multi-threading functionality. For each benchmark program, the output from the aspect-oriented version was compared to the output from the non-aspect-oriented version. The study found that each loop that was deemed parallelizable by the aspect-oriented benchmark program was executed in parallel (with multiple threads) by both versions of the program - the aspect-oriented version and the non-aspect-oriented version. There were some loops in the non-aspect-oriented benchmark programs that were deemed parallelizable and executed in parallel, but those same loops were deemed non-parallelizable by their associated aspect-oriented benchmark program. This discrepancy is explained by the study 2 ̆ 7 s conservative approach to identifying loops as parallelizable...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{shearing}} {{of sheep}} is labour-intensive, expensive and presents significant occupational {{health and safety}} risks. The only alternative at present is based on injection of epidermal growth factor, which severs the fibre at the follicle level. This technology cannot be used in pregnant animals and requires application of a net to retain the severed fleece. An alternative is to create a weakened zone within the wool staple, which would be sufficiently strong to retain the fleece on the sheep while a protective covering regrows, but sufficiently weak as to allow painless and automated removal of the fleece. We demonstrate that this approach is possible using mixtures of amino acids lacking lysine and methionine. Initially we demonstrate the relationships between staple strength, a subjective ‘harvestability’ score and a subjective ‘pain’ score, using fleeces from animals treated with varying levels of cortisol to create a wide range of strengths of wool attachment. We assigned a score to the ease with which we could manually break the staples, and also to the animal’s response to breaking the staples still attached to the skin. The relationships between these variables indicated that a staple was considered harvestable and could be removed with minimal skin flinch response at a staple strength of ~ 10 – 13 N/kTex. Staples within this range were then produced by intravenous infusion of mixtures of amino acids lacking in lysine and methionine for a 5 -day period. The weak point was uniformly created across the entire fleece and when a prototype rollerpin device was applied to the weakened wool, it uniformly broke the fleece of the three sheep tested. The mode of action of the amino acid treatment on wool growth was studied. There was no effect of unbalanced amino acids on the rate of follicle bulb cell division, the number of active wool follicles, or the length of the keratinisation zone in the wool follicle. Fibre diameter was reduced by ~ 4 microns by treatment, and intrinsic fibre strength (strength relative to cross-sectional area of the wool fibres), was reduced by ~ 50 %. Results of these trials are encouraging but further work is required to develop a practical, on-farm method of altering systemic amino acid supply and to design an automated, high-throughput system of severing the weakened wool.

40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} potential of certain Future Studies techniques (Barbieri Masini, 1994) to {{provide insight into the}} question of how developing countries might best exploit Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for higher education. First, three case studies were examined: the African Virtual University (AVU), the Arab Open University (AOU) and the Syrian Virtual University (SVU). From these accounts, key variables related to the research question were identified, the selection of variables validated by comparison with D–Antoni (2003). Globalisation is seen as a key change driver. Secondly, a model of 'ICT Strategy' was developed, elaborating the well-known concept of distance education 'generations', building on the work of Nipper (1989) and subsequent authors. A model of 'Student Learning' was also developed, drawing on Conole et al. (2004). These models were then coordinated to generate possible scenarios for how ICT strategy might influence student learning, making assumptions about 'typical' usage. There is no presumption of deriving ineluctable scenarios from unproblematic antecedent models; the aim rather was to explore the limitations of the best models currently available as generators of broad-brush scenarios, to try to understand the ways in which such models could be improved. One interpretation is that if institutions, under pressure for globalisation, adopted 2 nd generation technologies alone, the impact on Student Learning would be neglect of Social aspects. Meanwhile, although a mix of generations could in principle provide coverage of the whole Individual-Social dimension, if institutions adopted 3 rd technologies alone, the impact on Student Learning would be neglect of Individual aspects. This provides support for the warning by Clegg et al (2003) that uncritical acceptance of pressures to adopt new ICT for education, under the rhetoric of 'student-centred learning', can in fact turn out to have negative consequences for students. Moreover, it should not be assumed that a move to using 5 th and 6 th generation technologies exclusively necessarily represents a progression. If the AVU chose this strategy without high bandwidth for online video conferencing, the analysis suggests that its students would miss out on Social aspects. Nevertheless, {{it is also possible that}} a move straight to the fourth and subsequent generations could, in principle, provide coverage of the Individual-Social dimension, without the need for face-to-face tutorials or unreliable postal systems that feature in earlier generations. Four scenarios are discerned, distinguished by the balance between presentation of information and direct experience on the one hand, and the level of student autonomy on the other. None of the case study universities is yet clearly positioned in a single scenario. Examination of the strength of the analysis suggests that although some testable hypotheses have been generated in relation to diverse pedagogical scenarios, a richer selection of variables, more sophisticated models, and more detailed institutional data would be of value.

PURPOSE: The Yukon Arctic Ultra is considered the longest and coldest ultraendurance event in the world. Recently, cold exposure and exercise {{have been reported to}} influence circulating levels of certain myokines and proteins that may influence the “browning” of white adipose tissue. The {{purpose of the study was}} to evaluate the influence of the Yukon Arctic Ultra (430 mile participants) on serum irisin, meteorin, IL- 6, and FGF 21 in healthy individuals. METHODS: Eight male and female participants (mean±SEM; age = 44 ± 3 yr; BMI = 23. 3 ± 0. 9) were recruited for participation. Blood samples were collected at pre-event, mid event (200 mile) and post-event checkpoints. RESULTS: The average temperature during the event ranged from - 45 ºC to - 8 ºC. Due to the challenging conditions, only 50 % of the participants finished the event and they lost 2. 2 ± 0. 3 kg of body weight. Serum irisin was 307 ± 63 ug/ml (pre-event), rose to 496 ± 17 ug/ml (mid-event), and remained elevated at 513 ± 18 (post-event) but the lack of significance was likely due to attrition. Serum meteorin remained stable at 3. 1 ± 0. 1 ng/ml (pre-event), 3. 1 ± 0. 0 (mid-event), and 3. 0 ± 0. 1 ng/ml (post-event). Serum IL- 6 fell from 183 ± 51 ug/ml (pre-event), to 118 ± 55 ug/ml (mid-event), to 90 ± 39 ug/ml (post-event). Serum FGF 21 was 30 ± 3 ug/ml (pre-event), 34 ± 8 ug/ml (mid-event), and 62 ± 21 ug/ml (post-event). CONCLUSION: The combined influence of cold exposure and extreme levels of prolonged ultraendurance exercise may promote elevations in serum irisin and FGF 21, while IL- 6 may decline under these circumstances. Despite previous reports in pre-clinical studies of cold exposure induced increments in serum meteorin, these responses were not evident in a limited number of humans undergoing substantially greater metabolic stress. Utilizing participants competing in all distances of Yukon Arctic Ultra 2016 and hot-weather marathons, future studies are planned to gather more data on serum myokines, and examine potential changes in FNDC 5 and PGC- 1 α in muscle and UCP- 1 gene expression in white adipose tissue...|$|R
40|$|Youth {{environmental}} education (EE) {{is at least}} 40 years old and outdoor education is even older (Carter & Simmons, 2010). While few studies have documented the lasting impacts of these programs on youth participants as they have grown into adulthood, the broad goals of {{environmental education}} to inspire and enable life-long environmental stewardship necessitate such long-term research. Retrospective studies with environmentalists and environmental educators, {{as well as with}} the general public, suggest that childhood experiences in nature are linked to adult environmental attitudes and behaviors (Wells, & Lekies, 2012). These studies provide conceptual support for outdoor and environmental education, but do not document the lasting impacts of specific programs. This dissertation expands on prior research in interpretation (i. e., Knapp, 2007), investigating what past participants remember from a residential outdoor environmental education (ROEE) program, and draws on a new body of literature to explore how participants use these memories in subsequent years. The first article (chapter) is a literature review that summarizes and critiques (1) studies broadly focused on life experiences that have influenced adult environmental attitudes and behaviors and (2) long-term evaluations of interpretive, outdoor education, and environmental education programs. The second article reports data from 45 retrospective interviews with adults who participated in a fifth-grade ROEE program between 1958 and 1992. This paper focuses on what participants remember from the experience, looking specifically at the characteristics of remembered program components. Experiences that were active, offered opportunities for iii achievement, involved social interactions, and were both distinctive and applicable at home were found to be particularly memorable. The third article in this dissertation considers how people use their memories of ROEE, reporting the results of 54 retrospective interviews at two research sites with teens who had attended ROEE programs five years earlier. The psychological literature suggests that autobiographical episodic memories serve directive, social, and self functions (Bluck, 2003), and this dissertation research documents memories of ROEE being used to understand and appreciate wild nature, to direct outdoor recreation and environmental conservation behaviors, and to reminisce with friends. Considered together, the research presented in this dissertation offers insight into how current educators can design memorable programs and then encourage memory use. References Bluck, S. (2003).
