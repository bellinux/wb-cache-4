40|$|Purpose: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} how <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 80 years or older value different preventive health measures compared to <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 65 to 79 years. Design and Methods: We surveyed 107 <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 80 years or older and 93 <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 65 to 79 years; we randomly selected all of them from a large academic primary care practice. We mea-sured perceived importance and priority placed on different preventive health measures, including screen-ing tests; counseling on healthy lifestyle and geriatric health issues; immunizations; and recommendations for over-the-counter prevention medications. Results: Of the 200 women, 28. 5 % were aged 80 to 84 and 25. 0 % were aged 85 years or older. The majority {{of the women were}} non-Hispanic White (65. 5 %), had private insurance (82. 0 %), and were in good health condition (52. 0 %). <b>Women</b> <b>aged</b> between 65 and 79 were more likely than <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 80 or older to consider screening tests and exercise counseling essential or very important to maintaining their health. <b>Women</b> <b>aged</b> 80 or older did not value any preventive health measure more highly than did younger women. Women who were 65 to 79 years of age ranked mammography screening as their most valued pre-ventive health measure, with five of their top six measures being screening tests. Women who were 85 years of age or older prioritized flu shots, recommendations for aspirin, and thenmammography screening. Implications: Screening tests and exer-cise counseling are more highly valued by <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 65 to 79 years than by <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 80 years or older. Regardless of age, mammography screening is prioritized over other preventive health measures. Understanding how older women value different preventive health measures may help clinicians im-prove their preventive health counseling...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate screening performance measures in the English screening units that began inviting <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 65 – 70 between 1 April 2001 and 1 April 2004. We analysed results after each unit commenced inviting <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 65 – 70. In addition, we analysed data from units that invited this age group for a second time between 1 April 2004 and 31 March 2007. Results for <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 65 – 70 were compared to <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 50 – 64 and 60 – 64. Average uptake was 72. 8 % for <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 65 – 70 and 76. 7 % for <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 50 – 64. For women screened within the last 5 years, uptake was 88. 7 % for older women and 89. 1 % for younger women. For women previously screened within 5 years the invasive cancer detection rate was 17 % higher in the 65 – 70 age group than in the 60 – 64 age group. The rates of recall to assessment and PPV were 3. 5 and 27. 6 % in <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 65 – 70 and 3. 4 and 24. 6 % in <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 50 – 64 respectively. These results suggest that, as in the earlier demonstration studies, uptake rates remain high in older women, and many more older women attend following an invitation than had previously self-referred. The cancer detection rate is higher in this older age group, whereas rates of recall are generally similar to those in younger women; consequently the PPV is also higher in older women...|$|R
25|$|These {{recommendations}} {{have not}} held up with further data analysis, however. Subsequent findings {{released by the}} WHI showed that all cause mortality was not dramatically different between the groups receiving conjugated equine estrogen (CEE), those receiving estrogen and progesterone, and those not on HRT at all. Specifically, the relative risk for all-cause mortality was 1.04 (confidence interval 0.88–1.22) in the CEE-alone trial and 1.00 (CI, 0.83–1.19) in the estrogen plus progesterone trial. Further, in analysis pooling data from both trials, post menopausal HRT {{was associated with a}} significant reduction in mortality (RR, 0.70; CI, 0.51–0.96) among <b>women</b> <b>ages</b> 50 to 59.

25|$|The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for {{chromium}} in 2001. For chromium {{there was}} not sufficient information to set EARs and RDAs, so needs are described as estimates for Adequate Intakes (AIs). The current AIs for chromium for <b>women</b> <b>ages</b> 14 and up is 25 μg/day up to age 50 and 20 μg/day for older. AI for pregnancy is 30 μg/day. AI for lactation is 45 μg/day. For men ages 14 and up 35 μg/day up to age 50 and 30 μg/day for older. For infants to children ages 1–13 years the AI increases with age from 0.2 to 25 μg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of chromium there is not yet enough information and hence no UL.

25|$|DES gained notoriety when it {{was shown}} to cause a rare vaginal tumor in girls and young {{women who had been}} exposed to this drug in utero. In 1971, the New England Journal of Medicine {{published}} a report showing that seven of eight girls and young <b>women</b> (<b>ages</b> 14 to 22) who had been diagnosed with vaginal clear cell adenocarcinoma had been exposed prenatally to DES. Subsequent studies have shown an approximate 40-fold increased risk of vaginal/cervical clear cell adenocarcinoma in women exposed in utero to DES. As a consequence of this evidence, DES is considered an established human carcinogen. DES {{was one of the first}} transplacental carcinogens discovered in humans, meaning a toxin could cross the placenta and harm the fetus. It had originally been believed that the placenta protected the developing fetus but it is now known that is not true. Daughters exposed to DES in utero may also have an increased risk of moderate to severe cervical squamous cell dysplasia and an increased risk of breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|Women {{also played}} an {{important}} role in British industrial production during the war, in areas such as metals, chemicals, munitions, shipbuilding and engineering. At the beginning of the war in 1939 17.8% of women made up employment in these industries and by 1943 they made up 38.2%. With the start of the war there was an urgent need to expand the country’s labour force and women were seen as a source of factory labour. Before the war women in industrial production were exclusively on assembly, which was seen as cheap and undemanding work but during the war women were needed in other areas in the production process that were previously done by men such as Lathe operators. The Ministry of Labour created training centres that gave an introduction to the engineering process, and by 1941 women were allowed entrance as the importance of the engineering industry grew and became a large source of female employment. Areas such as aircraft manufacture, light and heavy general engineering and motor vehicle manufacturing all saw an increase in female employment during the war. Aircraft production saw the largest rise in female employment as it rose from 7% in 1935 to 40% in 1944. At the start of the war men who were already in engineering were prevented from going to war because engineering was seen as an important industry to war production but in 1940 there became a need for more female workers to supply the necessary labour for factory expansion. By 1941 with the shortage of skilled labour the Essential Workers Order was introduced which required all skilled workers to register and prevented workers from quitting from jobs that were deemed essential to the war effort without agreement from a National Service Officer. The Registration for the Employment Order in 1941 and the Women of Employment Order in 1942 also attempted to get more women into the workforce. The Women of Employment Order required <b>women</b> <b>ages</b> 18–45 to register for labour exchanges and by 1943 the maximum age was raised to 50, which brought an additional 20,000 women into the workforce. Aircraft production was given the top labour priority and many women were diverted into it with some even being transferred from agricultural production.|$|E

The {{objective of this}} study was to estimate the risk of medical and obstetric complications among <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 45 and older. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to identify pregnant woman during admission for delivery. Deliveries were identified using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD- 9 -CM) codes. Using ICD- 9 -CM codes, pre-existing medical conditions and medical and obstetric complications were identified in women at the time of delivery and were compared for <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 45 years and older to <b>women</b> under <b>age</b> 35. Outcomes among <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 35 - 44 were also compared to <b>women</b> under <b>age</b> 35 to determine if women in this group demonstrated intermediate risk between the older and younger groups. Logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios with 95 % confidence intervals for pre-existing medical conditions and medical and obstetric complications for both older groups relative to women under 35. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were also developed for outcomes at delivery among older women, while controlling for pre-existing medical conditions, multiple gestation, and insurance status, to determine the effect of age on the studied outcomes. <b>Women</b> <b>aged</b> 45 and older had higher adjusted odds for death, transfusion, myocardial infarction/ischemia, cardiac arrest, acute heart failure, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, acute renal failure, cesarean delivery, gestational diabetes, fetal demise, fetal chromosomal anomaly, and placenta previa compared to women under 35. Pregnant <b>women</b> <b>aged</b> 45 and older experience significantly more medical and obstetric complications and are more likely to die at the time of a delivery than <b>women</b> under <b>age</b> 35, though the absolute risks are low and these events are rare.
