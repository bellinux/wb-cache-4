25|$|Nonconducting {{specimens}} may be imaged <b>without</b> <b>coating</b> {{using an}} environmental SEM (ESEM) or low-voltage mode of SEM operation. In ESEM instruments the specimen {{is placed in}} a relatively high-pressure chamber and the electron optical column is differentially pumped to keep vacuum adequately low at the electron gun. The high-pressure region around the sample in the ESEM neutralizes charge and provides an amplification of the secondary electron signal. Low-voltage SEM is typically conducted in an FEG-SEM because field emission guns (FEG) are capable of producing high primary electron brightness and small spot size even at low accelerating potentials. To prevent charging of non-conductive specimens, operating conditions must be adjusted such that the incoming beam current is equal to sum of outcoming secondary and backscattered electrons currents a condition that is more often met at accelerating voltages of 0.3–4 kV.|$|E

50|$|In the mid 1990s, {{independent}} of the laser peening developments ongoing in the United States and France, Yuji Sano of the Toshiba Corporation in Japan initiated {{the development of a}} laser peening system capable of laser peening welds in nuclear plant pressure vessels to mitigate stress corrosion cracking in these areas. The system used a low energy pulsed laser operating at a higher pulse frequency than the higher powered lasers. The laser beam was introduced into the pressure vessels through articulated tubes. Because the pressure vessels were filled with water, the process did not require a water overlay over the irradiated surface. However, the beam had to travel some distance through the water, necessitating using a shorter wavelength beam, 532 μm, to minimize dielectric breakdown of the beam in the water, instead of the 1054 μm beam used in the United States and France. Also, it was impractical to consider using an opaque overlay. This process is now known as Laser Peening <b>without</b> <b>Coating</b> (LPwC). It began to be applied to Japanese boiling water and pressurized water reactors in 1999.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The anti-soiling layer was {{coated on}} the surface of Fresnel lens for {{concentrator}} photovoltaic. The anti-soiling layer was prepared by coating the acrylic urethane capping layer, the inorganic/organic nano-graded intermediate layer, and the photocatalytic surface layer including modified WO 3 and partial hydrolyzed tetraethyl orthosilicate. The adherent sand for the sample <b>without</b> <b>coating</b> was 0. 023 g and that for the sample with coating was 0. 008 g. The adhesion of sand was suppressed owing to the effect of the anti-soiling coating. The electrostatic potential for the sample <b>without</b> <b>coating</b> was 0. 23 kV, and the value was much higher than that for the sample with coating. The electrostatic charge at the surface of sample was suppressed with the anti-soiling coating...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{the effect of}} Titanium oxide coating on the performance characteristics of the bio-diesel fuelled engine. The engine used was four strokes, single cylinder direct injected diesel engine. The engine was tested with diesel & at different proportionality of diesel with Honge bio-diesel and by varying torque <b>without</b> <b>coating.</b> Then, the piston head was coated with thermal barrier material. The layer of thermal coating was made of Alumina-Titanium oxide (Al 2 O 3 /TiO 2) plasma coated on {{to the base of}} NiCrAl. Then the coated piston was tested at the same operation conditions as the standard (<b>without</b> <b>coating)</b> engine. The results indicate a reduction in specific fuel consumption and an improved brake thermal efficiency for titanium oxide coated piston.

40|$|The {{sand mold}} 3 D {{printing}} technologies enable the manufacturing of molds with great dimensional accuracy. However, the roughness of as-cast components is higher when {{cast in a}} 3 D printed mold {{rather than in a}} traditional sand mold. Coating the inner cavity is an efficient solution but can be costly and, in the narrowest cavities, not achievable. Finding a procedure to reduce the as-cast roughness <b>without</b> <b>coating</b> would ease the casting procedures. In the present work, surface analysis of ZE 41 magnesium alloy is presented after being cast in 3 D printed furan sand molds <b>without</b> <b>coating</b> using the low-pressure casting process. The molten metal temperature was measured during casting at different positions along the cast cavity. The as-cast surface roughness was correlated to the molten metal temperature and solid fraction at the time of contact against the sand mold surface...|$|E
