He used {{terminology}} and phrases such as Rama-rajya from Ramayana, Prahlada as a paradigmatic icon, and such cultural symbols as another facet of swaraj and satyagraha. These ideas sounded strange outside India, during his lifetime, but they readily and deeply resonated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> and historic values of his people.|$|E

5|$|A {{particular}} {{definition of}} Mitică and mitici {{was adopted by}} many inhabitants of Transylvania, who used the terms in reference to either Bucharest-based politicians or inhabitants of the city at large, and contrasted them with their counterparts to the northwest. The character has thus evolved to include a stereotypical view of contemporary Bucharesters or Wallachians, one which depicts them as , arrogant, aggressive and cunning. In other contexts, the mitici {{may be seen as}} not having an adequate familiarity <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> of Transylvania, and are associated with the Balkans (whereas Transylvania is identified with Central Europe).|$|E

5|$|Emperor Taizong, {{also known}} by his {{personal}} name Li Shimin, was familiar <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> of the steppe nomads and employed military strategies using steppe tactics as a prince. Taizong was a skilled horsemen, and during {{a celebration of}} his victory and ascension to the throne, sacrificed a horse in a ritual derived from a Turkic religious practice. He was able to outmaneuver the heavy cavalry of the Sui Dynasty with his light cavalry, a characteristic of steppe warfare. Taizong shared personal relationships with Turkic allies as a prince, reinforced through oaths sworn as blood brothers. His later successes as an emperor against the armies of Central Asia through diplomacy and divide and rule {{are the result of}} his early experiences with Turkic culture.|$|E

Su was a general with military experience in Central Asia, and was familiar <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> of the steppes. He had been in contact with military leaders from the region. He was one of nine multi-ethnic commanders invited by Emperor Gaozong to a military event in 655.

2500|$|A {{central theme}} of the series is the ethical struggles which face <b>the</b> <b>Culture</b> when {{interacting}} <b>with</b> other societies - some of which brutalise their own members, pose threats to other civilisations, or threaten <b>the</b> <b>Culture</b> itself, <b>the</b> reactions to which conflicting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Culture's</b> philosophy of peace and individual freedom. <b>The</b> <b>Culture</b> tends to make major decisions based on the consensus formed by its Minds and, if appropriate, its citizens – or, in one instance, its entire population, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Culture's</b> {{decision to go to}} war with a rival civilisation decided by the direct democratic vote of trillions.

5|$|In 1843 he {{travelled}} to Italy {{where he}} remained for four years. On {{his return to}} London he suffered from depression and painted a number of notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded. In 1867 he was elected a Royal Academician, {{at the time the}} highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> of the Royal Academy. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, {{he was one of the}} most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame. In 1884 a selection of 50 of his works was shown at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.|$|E
5|$|Michael Lynch and Richard Oram portray David {{as having}} little initial {{connection}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> and {{society of the}} Scots; but both likewise argue that David became increasingly re-Gaelicised in the later stages of his reign. Whatever the case, David's claim to be heir to the Scottish kingdom was doubtful. David {{was the youngest of}} eight sons of the fifth from last king. Two more recent kings had produced sons. William fitz Duncan, son of King Donnchad II, and Máel Coluim, son of the last king Alexander, both preceded David in terms of the slowly emerging principles of primogeniture. However, unlike David, neither William nor Máel Coluim had the support of Henry. So when Alexander died in 1124, the aristocracy of Scotland could either accept David as King, or face war with both David and Henry I.|$|E
5|$|The Sustainment Brigade and its {{soldiers}} {{have been the subject}} of numerous army publications during its tours in Iraq, most of which having to do <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>culture</b> and lifestyle of soldiers serving the unit. Among these have been feature stories by the Multi-National Force: Iraq public affairs office, on married soldiers who deploy together. The Army Logistician, an Army publication for soldiers serving in support units, published a feature story on the stories of soldiers serving in Iraq for their September–October 2007 issue. This story was intended to display the versatility of sustainment brigades overall. Another story was written for defenselink.mil, the press service for the United States Armed Forces in March 2007 about soldiers of the brigade and how they react to the desert climate of the country, having to cope with sandstorms and other issues.|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{method of}} ascitic fluid <b>culturing</b> was compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bedside inoculation of ascites into blood culture bottles and into lysis-centrifugation tubes. <b>The</b> conventional <b>culture</b> method was compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> blood <b>culture</b> bottle method in 31 episodes of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). <b>Cultures</b> were positive <b>with</b> <b>the</b> conventional <b>culture</b> method in 11 (35 %) episodes and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> blood <b>culture</b> bottle method in 26 (84 %) episodes (P less than 0. 001). The lysis-centrifugation tube method was compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> blood <b>culture</b> bottle method in 24 episodes of SBP. <b>Cultures</b> were positive <b>with</b> <b>the</b> lysis-centrifugation tube method in 11 (46 %) episodes and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> blood <b>culture</b> bottle method in 19 (79 %) episodes (P less than 0. 05). Moreover, <b>the</b> blood <b>culture</b> bottle method also shortened {{the time needed}} {{for the detection of}} bacterial growth. In conclusion, bedside inoculation of ascites into blood culture bottles should be used routinely for patients with suspected SBP.
