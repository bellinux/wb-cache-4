5|$|To defeat more {{powerful}} monsters and gain experience points efficiently, players can join a party. A regular party {{has room for}} six members. Like in many other games, a <b>well-balanced</b> party will consist of several archetypes- namely a healer, a tank (the party member with high defense {{that will be the}} main target of the monster), and the damage dealer. The enmity system comes into play heavily in parties, as players try to keep the monsters attention off fragile jobs and on the tanks. A <b>well-balanced</b> team working together {{is the only way to}} defeat many of the game's enemies.|$|E
5|$|After {{the turn}} of the 19th century, {{architecture}} developed into the late Baroque style. Among the major proponents were Johan Conrad Ernst who built the Chancery Building or Kancellibygningen (1721) on Slotsholmen and Lauritz de Thurah who designed the Eremitage Palace (1734) in Dyrehaven, just north of Copenhagen. Even more ambitious was de Thurah's work at Ledreborg near Roskilde, where he succeeded in working the components into a <b>well-balanced</b> and cohesive Baroque palace.|$|E
5|$|Major League Baseball was {{developed}} by Atlus and published by LJN. It featured many facets of realistic gameplay and a focus on managerial details, which {{stressed the importance of}} choosing a <b>well-balanced</b> team. Despite its graphical limitations, it was considered a three-dimensional game at the time and was featured in the first issue of Nintendo Power as compared the system's other baseball games of the era.|$|E
5|$|Rats {{that live}} {{their entire lives}} indoors usually are able to avoid disease-causing {{bacteria}} such as Salmonella and Pseudomonas aeruginosa; the latter is absent in treated water. They may also more easily avoid vectors like cockroaches, beetles, and fleas which are essential for the spread of endemic typhus and intestinal parasites like the Rat tapeworm. Additionally, pet or laboratory rats enjoy the intrinsic benefits of having a consistent and <b>well-balanced</b> diet, along with access to medical care.|$|E
5|$|The German {{aircraft}} carrier Graf Zeppelin {{was the lead}} ship {{in a class of}} two carriers of the same name ordered by the Kriegsmarine. She was the only {{aircraft carrier}} launched by Germany and represented part of the Kriegsmarines attempt to create a <b>well-balanced</b> oceangoing fleet, capable of projecting German naval power far beyond the narrow confines of the Baltic and North Seas. The carrier would have had a complement of 42 fighters and dive bombers.|$|E
5|$|Blacklist {{campaign}} was also generally praised. According to IGN's McCaffrey, the game's story {{is superior to}} those of its predecessors: <b>well-balanced</b> and believable. He criticized Sam Fisher's new voice actor, who he thought failed to replicate Ironside's charm. Ben Reeves praised the story's plot twists and sympathetic characters. On the Joystiq blog, Xav De Matos liked the game's narrative urgency and engaging plot twists but criticized its rushed ending. Simon Miller of VideoGamer.com called the game forgettable and boring, with Fisher's new voice actor failing to bring personality to the character. Eurogamer Bramwell also criticized the game's lack of character development.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell's design aims were {{to create}} a <b>well-balanced,</b> {{high-performance}} bomber interceptor and fighter aircraft capable of fully exploiting {{the power of the}} Merlin engine, while being relatively easy to fly. At the time, with France as an ally, and Germany thought to be the most likely future opponent, no enemy fighters were expected to appear over Great Britain, enemy bombers would be required to fly to the UK over the North Sea and no single-engined fighter at the time had the range to accompany the bombers and successfully return to its own friendly airfields; to carry out the mission of home defence, the design was intended to climb quickly to meet enemy bombers.|$|E
5|$|Reitz {{received}} his earliest schooling at home, from a governess, {{and at a}} neighbouring farm. When he was nine years old, {{he went to the}} Rouwkoop Boarding School in Rondebosch (Cape Town). Here he stood out for his academic achievements and was subsequently elected Queen's Scholar by the Senate of the South African College in Cape Town. In the six years he spent at the College, after arriving in 1857, he received a broad education in arts and sciences, and developed himself into a <b>well-balanced</b> young man with obvious leadership qualities. He graduated from South African College in September 1863 with the equivalent of a modern bachelor's degree in arts and sciences.|$|E
5|$|France hosted England at Colombes on 1 January 1908 for {{the third}} rugby {{encounter}} between the two nations. Although France lost the game 0–19, the press did not consider it a crushing defeat, given that on the previous occasions England had scored 35 points and then 41. During the first half, two French players departed the field injured, {{so that by the}} second half, England had the advantage in numbers and were able to control the game, which at the start had appeared (to the French press) to be <b>well-balanced.</b> The forwards were considered to be at least equal to, if not better, than the English. Guillemin and Duval amongst the forwards, as well as the backs Hubert and Moure, drew praise from Reichel.|$|E
5|$|The combat was {{generally}} well-received, with some reviewers noting {{that it is}} mostly unchanged from the original Knights of the Old Republic. GameSpot compared the combat from the first Knights of the Old Republic to the second, saying that it isn't <b>well-balanced</b> in both; however, the reviewer wrote that it helps the combat remain spontaneous. GameZone said that the combat is not changed from the first Knights of the Old Republic to the second, but {{that this is a}} good thing since the combat in the original was enjoyable. IGN praised the game's AI, saying that it is easy to control the main character alone without controlling the party members. GameSpy's reviewer, on the other hand, said that he encountered problems with the combat AI that were not present in the original Knights of the Old Republic.|$|E
25|$|There {{should be}} a <b>well-balanced</b> {{adjustment}} among the crude, subtle, and causal utilizations.|$|E

25|$|The deep soils between Vienna and the Neusiedlersee {{are rapidly}} {{establishing}} {{a reputation for}} <b>well-balanced</b> red wines made from Zweigelt and Blaufränkisch. Being close to Vienna and full of history, the area is a popular area to visit.|$|E
25|$|The IGN review {{considered}} WarCraft II {{in general}} a <b>well-balanced</b> game, but GameSpot's retrospective review regarded Ogre-Mages with the Bloodlust spell as too powerful. IGN found that {{searching for the}} survivors of a defeated opponent could be tedious, and that the first few missions were very easy, although the final ones were challenging.|$|E
25|$|Patients with CFS {{benefit from}} a <b>well-balanced</b> diet and eating {{regularly}} (eating little and often), including slow-release starchy foods in meals and snacks. Although elimination diets are not generally recommended, many people experience relief of CFS symptoms with these diets, including gastrointestinal complaints. To avoid the risk of malnutrition, they should be supervised by a dietitian.|$|E
25|$|The Aurora {{was highly}} {{regarded}} {{at the time}} for its refined engine, excellent build quality, <b>well-balanced</b> ride, and structural integrity. During normal crush-to-failure tests done by automakers to evaluate body rigidity, the Aurora's unibody construction broke GM's testing machine. A frame-crusher otherwise used to test stronger truck frames had to be used instead, with the car exceeding federal standards for passenger cars by two times.|$|E
25|$|Soil: Snails dig in {{soil and}} ingest it. Good soil favors snail growth and {{provides}} some of their nutrition. Lack of access to good soil may cause fragile shells even when the snails have <b>well-balanced</b> feed; the snails growth may lag far behind the growth of other snails on good soil. Snails will often eat feed, then go eat dirt. Sometimes, they will eat only one or the other.|$|E
25|$|The 7,866 {{pipe organ}} was built during 1950–1954 by Harrison & Harrison in Durham, to the {{specification}} of the London County Council's consultant, Ralph Downes, who also supervised the tonal finishing. It {{was designed as}} a <b>well-balanced</b> classical instrument embracing a number of rich and varied ensembles which alone or in combination could equal the dynamic scale of any orchestra or choral grouping, in addition to coping with the entire solo repertoire.|$|E
25|$|However, many of Károlyi's most {{prominent}} gymnasts have vehemently defended him against these allegations. Nadia Comăneci, in her memoir Letters to a Young Gymnast, remarked that she literally trusted Károlyi with her life. She {{also stated that}} in Romania, the gymnasts at Károlyi's school consumed <b>well-balanced</b> diets and, in fact, ate better than most other civilians {{in the country at}} the time. Olympic medalists and Károlyi gymnasts Mary Lou Retton, Phoebe Mills, and Kim Zmeskal, among others, have also praised Károlyi and his training regimen.|$|E
25|$|The Shiloh Shepherd is powerfully {{built and}} <b>well-balanced</b> {{and should have}} a proud {{carriage}} and smooth, effortless gait. The male Shiloh stands 30inches (76cm) or more in height {{with a minimum of}} 28inches (71cm); he weighs 120 to 140pounds (54–65kg) with a minimum of 110pounds (50kg). The female is smaller, standing 28inches (71cm) or more in height with a minimum of 26inches (66cm) and weighing 100 to 120pounds (45–54kg) with a minimum of 80pounds (36kg). With their even proportions, Shilohs should appear longer than they are tall. They are bigger than German Shepherd Dogs.|$|E
25|$|Kellogg {{believed}} that most disease is alleviated by {{a change in}} intestinal flora; that bacteria in the intestines can either help or hinder the body; that pathogenic bacteria produce toxins during the digestion of protein that poison the blood; that a poor diet favors harmful bacteria that can then infect other tissues in the body; that the intestinal flora is changed by diet and is generally {{changed for the better}} by a <b>well-balanced</b> vegetarian diet favoring low-protein, laxative, and high-fiber foods; and that this natural change in flora could be sped by enemas seeded with favorable bacteria, or by various regimens of specific foods designed to heal specific ailments.|$|E
25|$|Supplementation is {{generally}} not recommended for healthy adults who consume a <b>well-balanced</b> diet which includes {{a wide range of}} foods. However, supplementation under the care of a physician may be necessary for premature infants or those with low birth weights, infants fed unfortified formula or cow's milk {{during the first year of}} life, and malnourished young children. Physicians may consider copper supplementation for 1) illnesses that reduce digestion (e.g., children with frequent diarrhea or infections; alcoholics), 2) insufficient food consumption (e.g., the elderly, the infirm, those with eating disorders or on diets), 3) patients taking medications that block the body's use of copper, 4) anemia patients who are treated with iron supplements, 5) anyone taking zinc supplements, and 6) those suffering from osteoporosis.|$|E
25|$|The church's {{policy toward}} Native Americans also {{came under fire}} during the 1970s. In {{particular}} the Indian Placement Program was criticized as neocolonial. In 1977, the U.S. government commissioned a study to investigate accusations that the church was using its influence to push children into joining the program. However, the commission rejected these accusations {{and found that the}} program was beneficial in many cases, and provided <b>well-balanced</b> American education for thousands, allowing the children to return to their cultures and customs. One issue was that the time away from family caused the assimilation of Native American students into American culture, rather than allowing the children to learn within, and preserve, their own culture. By the late 1980s, the program had been in decline, and in 1996, it was discontinued.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{imperfections}} in the new South Africa where I would have hoped that things would be better, but on balance I think we have basically achieved what we set out to achieve. And if I were to draw balance sheets on where South Africa stands now, I would say that the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-à-vis Zimbabwe. But the positives – the stability in South Africa, the adherence to <b>well-balanced</b> economic policies, fighting inflation, doing all the right things in order to lay the basis and the foundation for sustained economic growth – are in place.|$|E
25|$|The wings have an {{intentional}} twist in their shape which causes the wing roots to stall {{in advance of}} the wingtips, which has the effect of the ailerons being fully effective well after the onset of a primary stall condition. Other unfavourable flight conditions are often guarded against, such as a wing drop, which may only be produced as a consequence of prolonged and excessive elevator application during a steep climbing turn, and can be rectified by the relaxation of back pressure. The control forces across all regimes are <b>well-balanced,</b> which reportedly reduces the frequency to which trimming of the control surfaces may need to be performed. Many of the flight control surfaces, such as the elevators and ailerons, are push-rod actuated, while control of the rudder is achieved via cables. As a measure to protect against instances of over-rotation, a reinforced plastic skid is present underneath the tail unit.|$|E
25|$|Both the Chennai Super Kings and the Mumbai Indians {{were a part}} of the {{original}} eight teams of the Indian Premier League when its first season was held in 2008. From the first season, Chennai had been a formidable, <b>well-balanced</b> team with a strong lineup of Indian players, including the captain of India Mahendra Singh Dhoni. Dhoni was bought for US$1.5 million, the highest of the 2008 auction, and appointed their captain. They immediately became runners-up in 2008 and had continued to appear in every knockout/playoff stage since. They were the most successful IPL team, being twice champions and twice runners-up in the IPL and also the winners of the 2010 Champions League Twenty20. Apart from Dhoni, their most recognised player is Suresh Raina, who has played in every one of Chennai's matches and holds the record for most career runs in the IPL. Chennai's squad is batting oriented, largely consisting of specialist batsmen and all-rounders in favour of specialist bowlers.|$|E
25|$|As a wine country, Germany has a mixed {{reputation}} internationally, {{with some}} consumers on the export markets associating Germany with the world's most elegant and aromatically pure white wines while other see the country mainly {{as the source}} of cheap, mass-market semi-sweet wines such as Liebfraumilch. Among enthusiasts, Germany's reputation is primarily based on wines made from the Riesling grape variety, which at its best is used for aromatic, fruity and elegant white wines that range from very crisp and dry to <b>well-balanced,</b> sweet and of enormous aromatic concentration. While primarily a white wine country, red wine production surged in the 1990s and early 2000s, primarily fuelled by domestic demand, and the proportion of the German vineyards devoted to the cultivation of dark-skinned grape varieties has now stabilized at slightly {{more than a third of}} the total surface. For the red wines, Spätburgunder, the domestic name for Pinot noir, is in the lead.|$|E
25|$|Chenin blanc (known also as Pineau de la Loire {{among other}} names) {{is a white}} wine grape variety from the Loire Valley of France. Its high acidity means {{it can be used}} to make {{everything}} from sparkling wines to <b>well-balanced</b> dessert wines, although it can produce very bland, neutral wines if the vine's natural vigor is not controlled. Outside the Loire it is found in most of the New World wine regions; it is the most widely planted variety in South Africa, where it is also known as Steen. The grape may have been one of the first to be grown in South Africa by Jan van Riebeeck in 1655, or it may have come to that country with Huguenots fleeing France after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. Chenin blanc was often misidentified in Australia as well, so tracing its early history in the country is not easy. It may have been introduced in James Busby's collection of 1832, but C. Waterhouse was growing Steen at Highercombe in Houghton, South Australia by 1862.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{argues that}} {{although}} some of these women {{may appear to be}} engaging in traditional subordinate or submissive roles, BDSM allows women in both dominant and submissive roles to express and experience personal power through their sexual identities. In a study that she conducted in 2013, she found {{that the majority of the}} women she interviewed identified as bottom, submissive, captive, or slave. In turn, Prior was able to answer whether or not these women found an incongruity between their sexual identities and feminist identity. Her research found that these women saw little to no incongruity, and in fact felt that their feminist identity supported identities of submissive and slave. For them these are sexually and emotionally fulfilling roles and identities that, in some cases, feed other aspects of their lives. Prior contends that third wave feminism provides a space for women in BDSM communities to express their sexual identities fully, even when those identities seem counter-intuitive to the ideals of feminism. Furthermore, women who do identify as submissive, sexually or otherwise, find a space within BDSM where they can fully express themselves as integrated, <b>well-balanced,</b> and powerful women.|$|E
25|$|Bone {{metabolism}} also changes. Normally, bone is {{laid down}} {{in the direction of}} mechanical stress. However, in a microgravity environment there is very little mechanical stress. This results in a loss of bone tissue approximately 1.5% per month especially from the lower vertebrae, hip and femur. Due to microgravity and the decreased load on the bones, there is a rapid increase in bone loss, from 3% cortical bone loss per decade to about 1% every month the body is exposed to microgravity, for an otherwise healthy adult. The rapid change in bone density is dramatic, making bones frail and resulting in symptoms which resemble those of osteoporosis. On Earth, the bones are constantly being shed and regenerated through a <b>well-balanced</b> system which involves signaling of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. These systems are coupled, so that whenever bone is broken down, newly formed layers take its place—neither should happen without the other, in a healthy adult. In space, however, there is an increase in osteoclast activity due to microgravity. This is a problem, because osteoclasts break down the bones into minerals that are reabsorbed by the body. Osteoblasts are not consecutively active with the osteoclasts, causing the bone to be constantly diminished with no recovery. This increase in osteoclasts activity has been seen particularly in the pelvic region, because this is the region which carries the biggest load with gravity present. A study demonstrated that in healthy mice, osteoclasts appearance increased by 197%, accompanied by a down-regulation of osteoblasts and growth factors that are known to help with the formation of new bone, after only sixteen days of exposure to microgravity. Elevated blood calcium levels from the lost bone result in dangerous calcification of soft tissues and potential kidney stone formation. It is still unknown whether bone recovers completely. Unlike people with osteoporosis, astronauts eventually regain their bone density. After a 3–4 month trip into space, it takes about 2–3 years to regain lost bone density. New techniques are being developed to help astronauts recover faster. Research on diet, exercise and medication may hold the potential to aid the process of growing new bone.|$|E
