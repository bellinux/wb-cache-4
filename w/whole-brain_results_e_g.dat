Applications of the result and technique of proof include new <b>results</b> (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> separable conjugate spaces embed isomorphically in spaces with boundedly complete bases; convex weakly compact sets are affinely homeomorphic to sets in a reflexive space) and simple proofs of known <b>results</b> (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> there is a reflexive space failing the Banach-Saks property; if X is separable, then X = Z∗∗Z for some Z; there is a separable space which does not contain l 1 whose dual is nonseparable) ...|$|R

40|$|Principals {{are always}} looking for {{effective}} ways to enhance the learning environment. The Balanced School Day (BSD) schedule, an alternative to the traditional schedule, reframes the school day by eliminating recess and lunch breaks and providing two scheduled nutrition breaks. Advantages and disadvantages to the schedule have been anecdotally reported. A two-year evaluation was completed to verify these claims. The BSD showed some favourable <b>results</b> (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> amount of instructional and transition time, school cleanliness), some positive trends (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> student concentration and behaviour in the hallway), and some mixed <b>results</b> (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> supervision time and outdoor time).
