5|$|In {{the late}} 1850s, William Russell, Alexander Majors, and William Waddell were the three {{founders of the}} Pony Express. They <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>in</b> the {{freighting}} and drayage business. At {{the peak of the}} operations, they employed 6,000 men, owned 75,000 oxen, thousands of wagons, and warehouses plus a sawmill, a meatpacking plant, a bank and an insurance company.|$|E
5|$|Automonopoli was {{released}} by Automata UK in June 1983, selling for £6 (£ as of 2015) Written primarily in BASIC, it modelled the board game Monopoly in every detail of gameplay. Although other versions of Monopoly for home computers <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>in</b> circulation for play between human players, {{at the time of}} its release Automonopoli was marketed as the first version of the game with an artificial intelligence advanced enough for the computer to play against human players.|$|E

50|$|Continuity: A {{story that}} <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>in</b> the news gathers {{a kind of}} inertia. This is partly because the media {{organizations}} <b>are</b> <b>already</b> <b>in</b> place to report the story, and partly because previous reportage may have made the story more accessible to the public (making it less ambiguous).|$|R

5|$|Both battalions {{were still}} {{in contact with the}} Germans during the {{withdrawal}} with 10 Para to the north having the furthest to travel to reach the relative safety of the rail crossing. By 15:00 it became obvious that the Germans <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>in</b> front of the battalion. Now, as well as fighting a rearguard action, they had to capture positions between themselves and the railway line. Captain Lionel Queripel of 10 Para was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross, the highest British military decoration, for his actions while in command of the battalion's rear guard.|$|E
5|$|Cray {{had always}} {{attacked}} {{the problem of}} increased speed with three simultaneous advances; more execution units to give the system higher parallelism, tighter packaging to decrease signal delays, and faster components {{to allow for a}} higher clock speed. Of the three, Cray was normally least aggressive on the last; his designs tended to use components that <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>in</b> widespread use, as opposed to leading-edge designs.|$|E
5|$|E.V. Ramasamy's father {{arranged}} for his wedding {{when he was}} nineteen. The bride, Nagammai, was only thirteen. Despite having an arranged marriage, Periyar and Nagammai <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>in</b> love with each other. Nagammai actively supported her husband in his later public activities and agitations. Two years after their marriage, a daughter was born to them. However, their daughter {{died when she was}} five months old. The couple had no more children.|$|E

5|$|Elie Wiesel {{was born}} on 30 September 1928 in Sighet, a town in the Carpathian {{mountains}} of northern Transylvania, to Chlomo Wiesel, a shopkeeper, and his wife, Sarah, née Feig. The family lived {{in a community of}} 10,000–20,000 mostly Orthodox Jews. Northern Transylvania had been annexed by Hungary in 1940, and restrictions on Jews <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>in</b> place, but the period Wiesel discusses {{at the beginning of the}} book, 1941–1943, was a relatively calm one for the Jewish population.|$|E
5|$|Emerald ash borer {{primarily}} infest and {{can cause}} significant damage to ash species including green ash (Fraxinus pennsylvanica), black ash (Fraxinus nigra), white ash (Fraxinus americana), and blue ash (Fraxinus quadrangulata) in North America. In Europe, Fraxinus excelsior is the main ash species colonized by EAB. Ash susceptibility can vary due to the attractiveness of chemical volatiles to adults, or the ability of larvae to detoxify phenolic compounds. Emerald ash borer has also been found infesting white fringe tree in North America, which is a non-ash host, but {{it is unclear whether}} the trees were healthy when first infested, or <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>in</b> decline due to drought.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Itza Maya from Motul de San José began the northward migration of Maya peoples to the Yucatán Peninsula {{at the end of the}} Classic Period. Classic period stelae at the site refer to the King of the Itzá, demonstrating that the Itza <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>in</b> the Petén region at this time. The nearby village of San José, on the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, is one of the last Itzá communities in Petén.|$|E

5|$|Lacking artistic {{stimulation}} in Morgantown, Lazzell {{journeyed to}} Provincetown, Massachusetts, in 1915. Already an artists' colony, Provincetown was {{a mecca for}} European artists escaping World War I. Stella Johnson and Jessie Fremont Herring, two of Lazzell's companions from her tour in Italy, <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>in</b> Provincetown and Lazzell stayed with Johnson's mother. Lazzell took a morning outdoor painting class that summer from Charles Webster Hawthorne at his Cape Cod School of Art where she was exposed to Fauvist color and technique. She returned to Morgantown in the autumn and held an exhibition in her studio that October.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{the storm}} {{resulted}} in 173confirmed fatalities. Officials in West Bengal accused the meteorological offices of issuing warnings too late, {{as most of}} the fishermen <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>in</b> deep sea areas. Immediately following the storm, the Indian Red Cross Society and the Participating National Societies began to assess the situation and plan. At a warehouse in Salt Lake City, Kolkata, the Indian Red Cross Society prepared to distribute 2,000tarpaulins, 2,000blankets, 200kitchen sets, and 20,000mosquito nets.|$|E

The first infomercial appeared in October 1995, offering a money-back guarantee and fast delivery, and featuring Judith Light, who suffered from acne problems herself. Rodan and Fields later founded their own skincare brand, Rodan + Fields.|$|E

5|$|The Bahrain Thirteen {{played an}} {{important}} role in mobilizing the public opinion against the government, organizing protests and shaping political demands. Some of the group <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>in</b> detention when the uprising began, having been arrested in the Manama incident the previous August, and were released on 22 February 2011. Abdulwahab Hussain and Hassan Mushaima, leaders of opposition parties Al Wafa' and Haq Movement respectively, were among the leaders of the 1990s uprising in Bahrain.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{passed the}} Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 {{to deal with}} what was {{believed}} to be an excess of Chinese labor-class immigrants, in particular in California. Many who <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>in</b> the United States, or were en route, went to Hawaii, and the islands were flooded with Chinese men. In 1883, between March and May, 3,400 Chinese male laborers arrived in Hawaii. The Hawaiian legislature then restricted immigration of Chinese men to 2,400 per year. Between 1878 and 1884, the population of Chinese laborers in Hawaii tripled.|$|E

5|$|The {{expansion}} of Mayfair moved upper class Londoners away from {{areas such as}} Covent Garden and Soho, which <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>in</b> decline by the 18th century. Part of its success was because of its proximity to the Court of St James and the parks, {{and because of the}} well-designed layout. This led to it sustaining its popularity into the 21st century. The requirements of the aristocracy led to various stables, coach houses and servants' accommodation being established along the mews running parallel to the streets. Some of the stables have since been converted into garages and offices.|$|E
5|$|The {{killing of}} Sotelo, a {{prominent}} member of Parliament, with {{involvement of the}} police, aroused suspicions and strong reactions among the government's opponents on the right. Massive reprisals followed. Although the conservative Nationalist generals <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>in</b> advanced stages of a planned uprising, the event provided a catalyst and convenient public justification for their coup, and in particular that Spain {{would have to be}} saved from anarchy by military rather than democratic means. The Socialists and Communists (led by Prieto) demanded that arms be distributed to the people before the military took over. The Prime Minister was hesitant.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Sri Lanka, {{the floods}} {{destroyed}} at least 24,750homes and damaged 32,426others, displacing about 800,000people, {{many of whom}} lost everything they owned.

Most of the deaths were along the nation's southern coast where the floods occurred, primarily along the Kalu River, and were mainly farmers. Levees helped drain floodwaters where systems <b>were</b> <b>already</b> <b>in</b> place.|$|E
