5|$|Published by Joseph Johnson, Mary {{itself was}} {{moderately}} successful, and sections {{of it were}} included in several collections of sentimental extracts that were popular at the time, such as The Young Gentleman and Lady's Instructor (1809). However, Johnson <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> sell copies {{of it in the}} 1790s and consistently listed it in the advertisements for her other works. It was not reprinted until the 1970s, when scholars became interested in Wollstonecraft and women's writing more generally.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Norman {{was visited}} {{by a young}} Bob Marley in his Bronx apartment. Norman had at that time written a number of songs for Johnny Nash, whose record label had just signed Marley, and Marley wanted {{to learn more about}} rhythm and blues. Along with Al Pyfrom, Norman's co-writer, and Marley's wife Rita, the pair spent several days in a jam session that {{ultimately}} resulted in a 24-minute tape of Marley performing several of his own and Norman-Pyfrom's compositions. According to Reggae archivist Roger Steffens, the tape—which was lost among Norman's possessions for decades—is rare for Marley in that it was influenced by pop music rather than reggae, highlighting a point in Marley's career when he <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> find his path. Some of the songs from this early jam session were released on the Marley album Chances Are.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} 20 {{years of the}} BAA/NBA, the league <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> gain the support of fans who lived {{in or near the}} teams' home markets. To achieve this, the league {{introduced}} the territorial pick rule to help teams acquire popular players from colleges in their area who would presumably have strong local support. Before the draft, a team could forfeit its first-round draft pick and then select any player from within a 50-mile radius of its home arena. Although the territorial picks were selected before the draft, these picks were not factored into the overall selection count of the draft; therefore, the first non-territorial pick of the draft was considered the first overall pick.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{before noon}} on 19 February, he used around fifty tanks, their crew and {{a mixture of}} {{infantry}} battalions to seize {{control of the military}} headquarters, the post office and the radio station of Saigon. He surrounded the home of General Khánh and Gia Long Palace, the residence of head of state Phan Khắc Sửu. The tanks were led by Colonel Dương Hiếu Nghĩa, a Catholic member of the Đại Việt. The country <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> find stability, with Phan Huy Quát being appointed prime minister just three days earlier. Khánh managed to escape and flee to Vũng Tàu. His plane lifted off from Tan Son Nhut Air Base, the country's military headquarters, just as rebel tanks were rolling in, attempting to block the runway. Thảo's men tried to capture the Saigon base of the Republic of Vietnam Navy, and its commander, Admiral Chung Tấn Cang, but were foiled, but they did capture a number of junta members at Tan Son Nhut.|$|E
5|$|The NK 6th Division and NK 7th Division {{closed on}} Masan, attacking the US 25th Infantry Division on {{multiple}} fronts, {{with the main}} efforts aimed at the 24th and 35th Infantry regiments. At {{the same time that}} the North Korean 7th Division was trying to penetrate the 35th Infantry positions around Sibidang and Komam-ni, the 6th Division also sent strong patrols and probing attacks against the mountainous middle part of the 25th Infantry Division line. When the division issued orders to its subordinate units to take up defensive positions west of Masan, the 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> seize Obong-san, the mountain ridge just west of Battle Mountain and P'il-bong, and across a gorge-like valley from them. At daybreak on August 15, the 2nd Battalion broke contact with the North Koreans and withdrew to Sobuk-san and the ridge west of Haman. The 3rd Battalion, 24th Infantry now came to the Haman area to help in the regimental defense of the sector.|$|E
5|$|The view of some modern {{scholars}} {{that the}} 4th-century cavalry {{was a more}} efficient service than the infantry was certainly not shared by Ammianus and his contemporaries. Ammianus describes three major battles which were actually or nearly lost due to the incompetence or cowardice of the Roman cavalry. (1) The Battle of Strasbourg (357), where the cavalry, including cataphracts, were routed by their German counterparts at an early stage, leaving the Roman infantry right wing dangerously exposed. After fleeing behind the infantry lines, it took the personal intervention of Julian to rally them and persuade them {{to return to the}} fight. (The cataphracts were later ordered to wear female clothes by Julian as punishment). (2) During his Persian campaign (363), Julian was obliged to sanction two cavalry units for fleeing when caught by surprise attacks (one unit was decimated, the other dismounted). Later, the Tertiaci cavalry regiment was ordered to march with the camp followers for deserting the field just as the infantry was on the point of breaking the Persian line. (3) At the Battle of Adrianople (378), the Roman cavalry was largely responsible for the catastrophic defeat. Scholae units started the battle by an unauthorised attack on the enemy wagon circle, at a moment when their emperor Valens <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> negotiate a truce with the Goths. The attack failed, and when the Gothic cavalry appeared, the Roman cavalry fled, leaving the Roman infantry left wing exposed. The Gothic cavalry then routed the Roman left wing, and the battle was as good as lost.|$|E

To make Bompensiero less cautious, Brooklier promoted him from soldier to consigliere. Six months later, the Los Angeles family <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> get to Bompensiero.|$|E
25|$|More {{quantitative}} {{studies by}} James Prescott Joule in 1843 onwards provided soundly reproducible phenomena, {{and helped to}} place the subject of thermodynamics on a solid footing. William Thomson, for example, <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> explain Joule's observations within a caloric framework as late as 1850. The utility and explanatory power of kinetic theory, however, soon started to displace caloric and it was largely obsolete {{by the end of}} the 19th century. Joseph Black and Lavoisier made important contributions in the precise measurement of heat changes using the calorimeter, a subject which became known as thermochemistry.|$|E
25|$|Avigdor Lieberman, the {{outgoing}} foreign minister, announced {{shortly before the}} 6 May deadline that his Yisrael Beiteinu party would not join a coalition with the Likud. Consequently, Netanyahu and his Likud party formed a narrow coalition government including The Jewish Home, United Torah Judaism, Kulanu, and Shas. This coalition commands a bare majority of 61 seats in the 120-seat Knesset. No candidate was announced to lead the Foreign Ministry. It was believed that Netanyahu <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> lure Herzog to lead the post, but Herzog rejected the idea. Due to {{the makeup of the}} coalition and its slim majority, analysts did not expect the government to last long or achieve much.|$|E

25|$|In 1520, while Hernán Cortés <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> conquer Tenochtitlan, the Spanish sent an {{expedition}} {{south of the}} valley into this area. In 1521, the Spanish fought the natives of Tlayacapan on the hill called Ziualopapalozink. The Spanish left the area and headed for Oaxtepec, Yautepec and then to Cuernavaca {{and back to the}} Valley of Mexico. The lords of Tlayacapan sent many warriors to Tenochtitlan to help defend the Aztec Empire. Tlayacapan was not completely subdued by Cortés militarily until 1539. The “spiritual conquest” began with the building of the San Juan Bautista monastery and its associated chapels in the 1530s by the Augustinians. A total of 26 chapels would be built through the town over older significant pre-Hispanic sites. However, in the early colonial period, the indigenous would hide native deities such as Yacatecutli, the god of commerce, inside hollow figures of saints and march with them in procession.|$|E
25|$|The Welsh kingdoms {{had been}} subject to Mercia since the mid seventh-century, and in 853 the Mercians {{received}} {{the assistance of the}} West Saxons to maintain their hegemony. In the 870s Mercia became subject to attacks by the Viking Great Heathen Army, and in 874 it drove out King Burgred, He was succeeded by the last independent King of Mercia, Ceolwulf II, who was presented by the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle as a puppet of the Vikings. In 877 they partitioned Mercia, taking the east for themselves and leaving the west to Ceolwulf. Gwynedd was also under attack from the Vikings, and in 877 King Rhodri Mawr was defeated and driven out. He returned the following year, but immediately came under attack from Mercia, which <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> maintain its hegemony in Wales. King Alfred's victory over the Vikings at the Battle of Edington in May 878 relieved the pressure on Mercia, and in the same year Mercia defeated and killed Rhodri Mawr. Ceolwulf died or was deposed in 879, and he was succeeded as Lord of the Mercians by Æthelred.|$|E
25|$|An {{advance party}} of Major General George Crook's {{division}} reached the important railroad intersection of Burkeville Junction, Virginia by 3:00p.m., blocking the Richmond and Danville Railroad {{route to the}} southwest. The main body of Crook's cavalry division and Brigadier General Joshua Chamberlain's infantry brigade from the V Corps also headed toward Jetersville, arriving before dark. A few hours later, {{the rest of the}} V Corps arrived at Jetersville and started to entrench, even extending the trenches across the railroad tracks. The arrival of the entire V Corps at Jetersville ended Lee's last chance to move south along the railroad, although if he had chosen to send Longstreet's corps which had arrived first at Amelia Court House south against the gathering Union force, his trailing divisions probably could not have caught up. Ewell <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> cross the Appomattox River at 10:00p.m.; Anderson was still skirmishing with Devin at Beaver Pond Creek; Gordon was several miles behind at Scott's Shop; and Mahone was not far from Goode's Bridge, waiting to protect the bridge in case Ewell could find no other river crossing. When Devin's cavalry broke off the engagement at Beaver Pond Creek, no Union force threatened the rear of Lee's army and Anderson's and Mahone's forces did not need to lag behind as rear guards. They did not arrive at Amelia Court House until well into the next day.|$|E
