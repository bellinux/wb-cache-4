She remarked, [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> fuss about who I was and wasn't dating. I {{was a pretty}} face and a big bust and nothing else. People in the business believed what they read about me. So I decided to move away and start again." [...] She believed that the anonymity she faced in America helped her get roles on merit and not due to her public image. She earned the part of Sala, the hench-woman to the villainous Drax (Treat Williams) in the superhero film The Phantom (1996), starring Billy Zane in the titular role. A reviewer for Variety considered Zeta-Jones to be a standout in her part, but the film received a negative critical reception and earned little at the box office. The CBS television miniseries Titanic (1996), however, was better received. Starring opposite Peter Gallagher and George C. Scott, she portrayed the lead role of Isabella Paradine, a young mother engaged in an extramarital affair on the [...]|$|E
500|$|Taylor's {{performance}} in Green Bay's 16–7 {{win over the}} Giants in the 1962 NFL Championship Game came to define his mental and physical toughness. In frigid conditions at Yankee Stadium, Taylor carried 31 times for 85yards and scored the Packers' only touchdown against what was considered the league's best defense, both statistically and by reputation. Lombardi entrusted Taylor with the ball, as he was confident his fullback {{would be able to}} move the offense and not turn it over. The game was highlighted by the fierce rivalry between Taylor and Giants linebacker Sam Huff. The two clashed on nearly every play and engaged in trash talk throughout the game. Steve Sabol, who filmed the game with his father for NFL Films, described it as such:The lasting image of that game in my mind is the ferocity and anger of Jim Taylor ... his barely restrained rage as he ran with the ball. Taylor just got the shit kicked out of him all day long ... There <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> trash-talking between him and especially Sam Huff ... Tons of profanity when they tackled him. I had never experienced anything like that.|$|E
500|$|The {{first version}} of [...] "Human Nature" [...] was written and {{composed}} for Michael Jackson by Steve Porcaro of Toto. Porcaro recorded a rough demo of the song on a cassette. He had written the song after his first-grade daughter came home crying because a boy pushed her off the slide. He blurted out three reasons for the incident to comfort her: one, the boy liked her, two, people can be strange and three, it's human nature. Fellow Toto band member David Paich gave the demo tape, along {{with two of his}} own songs, to producer Quincy Jones, hoping they would be used by Jackson. Jones did not think Paich's songs were right for Jackson's current work, but enjoyed the rough demo of [...] "Human Nature" [...] {{at the end of the}} cassette. Jones explained, [...] "All of a sudden, at the end, there <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> silence, there was: 'why, why, dah dah da-dum dah dah, why, why'. Just a dummy lyric and a very skeletal thing—I get goosebumps talking about it. I said, 'This is where we wanna go, because it's got such a wonderful flavor'". However, Jones was dissatisfied with the original lyrics and so John Bettis, who had written lyrics for hits by the Carpenters and the Pointer Sisters, among others, was asked to add lyrics to the song. He completed the song in two days. The producer asked if the song could be included on Jackson's album, to which Porcaro and Bettis agreed. [...] "Human Nature" [...] was the last song selected for Thriller, ousting [...] "Carousel" [...] from the final track listing.|$|E

2500|$|Producer Lee Joon-ik {{revealed}} {{the story of}} how he chose Lee for The King and the Clown by just seeing him do handstands, saying, [...] "Just because of handstands, Lee Joon-gi became the person he is today." [...] After the film, Lee became [...] "an icon" [...] of the South Korean [...] "pretty boy" [...] trend. Lee has since tried to downplay this kkonminam image, saying that his character Gong-gil in the film felt like a foot chain for him so he wanted to escape from it: [...] "After my performance in The King and the Clown, I found myself at the forefront of this ‘pretty boy’ trend, whether or not that was my intention. Suddenly, people were interested in me, and there <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> praise and criticism all at the same time. Everything was just so overwhelming. I felt like I was floating on air." ...|$|E

[...] She continues {{to appear as}} Norma, in Parma in and Teatro Colón 2001, and at the Opéra de Marseille and the Canadian Opera Company in 2006. Of that latter performance, Toronto's The Globe and Mail wrote: Bel canto is a term too often bandied about, {{but it does mean}} what it says: beautiful singing, but beautiful as distinct from merely pretty; beautiful not only in its musical sensitivity and accuracy of pitch in the face of extreme vocal challenges devised by the composer, but also in its penetration and detailed communication of the emotions encompassed in the music and drama. It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> that June Anderson's Norma comprehended and conveyed[...] [...] [...]|$|E

2500|$|On March 4 Nagin {{appeared}} {{before an audience}} of New Orleans evacuees at an event organized by the NAACP, where he made the statement that [...] "there <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> talk about this being an opportunity to change New Orleans forever and maybe everybody shouldn’t come back, and maybe {{this is an opportunity}} to kind of change New Orleans and go back to what it used to be. I have 23 candidates running for mayor and very few of them look like us. [...] There's a potential to be a major change in the political structure of New Orleans." [...] Some perceived these comments to be a divisive follow-up to his [...] "Chocolate City" [...] remarks, while others point out that the fact that Nagin is the only major African-American candidate in a field of 23 is a sign of the demographic shift in a city that was over two-thirds black before Katrina.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} the plan was announced, the non-Malays had, {{in the words of}} one commentator, [...] "a virtual {{monopoly}} of private industrial and commercial employment", and were concentrated in the urban areas. However, foreign interests controlled most modern industries, including manufacturing, banking, finance, rubber, and tin. The Malays were largely involved in rural occupations such as rice farming, fishing, tending to rubber or oil palm smallholdings, and so on. They were conspicuously absent from even minor white collar jobs, such as clerical work, and only in the civil service, where they were guaranteed 80% of all government jobs, were they present in the upper portion of the hierarchy. Most members of some professions, such as medicine and law, were non-Malay. Ironically, government policies, such as those set out by Article 153, appeared to hinder Malay involvement in the private sector by giving them preference in only the public sector. Unemployment among all races was also rampant, largely due to poor education, with about 70% of the 275,000 unemployed in 1970 being aged between 15 and 25years. It <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>this</b> that the NEP and the Second Malaysia Plan set out to change.|$|E
