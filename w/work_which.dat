Also <b>works,</b> <b>which</b> had written in emigration, did not represented, because «this is anthology of <b>works,</b> <b>which</b> was in UkrSSR before 1933».|$|R

50|$|Joseph Demarco {{has rarely}} been {{considered}} holistically.

Notwithstanding, no comprehensive and wideranging study of the man, his times and his accomplishments has ever been made. This is direly wanting.|$|R
