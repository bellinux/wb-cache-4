50|$|Rear {{suspension}} can {{be designed}} a number of ways. Many modern vehicles have rear suspension designs that are opposite of the front suspension: Toe in under bump, and out under droop. They can also be designed to have very little or no bump steer at all. Cars with rear live axles, also known as solid axles do not exhibit true bump steer, but can still cause some steering over one <b>wheel</b> <b>bumps,</b> see Difference between bump steer and roll steer. if both wheels on a live axle move upwards by the same amount, they tend not to steer.|$|R
50|$|Late {{vehicles}} had diesel engines, the Lister {{single cylinder}} LD1 or twin cylinder LD2 engines of 3.5 or 7 bhp @ 1800 rpm. The LD engines were already shrouded around their flywheel, cooling fan and the cylinder head fins {{and so there}} was no longer any need for the distinctive Auto-Truck engine cover or front plate. These late machines also used leaf spring front suspension, where the bearing ring was supported on the engine group by a pair of leaf springs. This gave much better isolation between front <b>wheel</b> <b>bumps</b> and the chassis, but the high unsprung weight, a drawback for all monowheel tractors, meant that they were still not high speed or effective road vehicles. By the mid 1950s, all production was diesel engined.|$|R

50|$|The {{stiffness}} of a bicycle wheel {{can be measured}} in three primary directions: radial, lateral, and torsional. The radial stiffness is primarily a measure of how well the <b>wheel</b> absorbs <b>bumps</b> from the surface on which it rolls. Lateral stiffness, especially of the front wheel influences the handling of the bicycle. Torsional, or tangential stiffness is a measure of how well the wheel transmits propulsive and braking forces, if applied at the hub, {{as in the case of}} hub or disk brakes.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{the open}} gap {{at a fixed}} V-crossing forms a weak point on the railway line where the heavily loaded <b>wheel</b> must <b>bump</b> across the {{resulting}} gap of about 10 cm, supported only by {{the portion of the}} wheel tread which is on the wing rail. This pounds the rail so much that the steel can deform and/or wear away. This damage may easily spread to other components including the wheels, and the noise can be a nuisance. Scheduling repair of damage can also be a problem in high traffic locations.|$|R
40|$|This {{is not to}} {{say that}} radical economists will always agree with Peterson or find her {{analysis}} more insightful than our own. There may be times when we believe she has invented new <b>wheels</b> that <b>bump</b> or squeak more than our old wheels did. I must admit there were times I found myself wishing Peterson were a professional economist. But if she were, it is unlikely she would have provided the breadth of knowledge and informa-tion she offers us. In other words, her comprehensive and holistic perspective is well worth the occasional irritation, and this is an excellent book to assign students who are either looking for a broader perspective on economic issues or need to be...|$|R
50|$|A {{torsion bar}} {{suspension}} is a thick, steel torsion-bar spring {{attached to the}} body of a vehicle at one end and to a lever arm which attaches to the axle of the wheel at the other. It absorbs road shocks as the <b>wheel</b> goes over <b>bumps</b> and rough road surfaces, cushioning the ride for the passengers. Torsion-bar suspensions are used in many modern cars and trucks, as well as military vehicles.|$|R
2500|$|The system {{comprises}} two {{suspension cylinders}} mounted horizontally {{on each side}} of the platform chassis. Inside the cylinders are two springs, one for each wheel, mounted at each end of the cylinder. The springs are connected to the front leading swinging arm and rear trailing swinging arm, that act like bellcranks by pull rods (tie rods). These are connected to spring seating cups in the middle of the cylinder, each spring being compressed independently, against the ends of the cylinder. Each cylinder is mounted using an additional set of springs, originally made from steel, called [...] "volute" [...] springs, on later models made from rubber. These allow the front and rear suspension to interconnect. When the front wheel is deflected up over a bump, the front pull rod compresses the front spring inside the cylinder, against the front of the cylinder. This also compresses the front [...] "volute" [...] spring pulling the whole cylinder forwards. That action pulls the rear wheel down on the same side via the rear spring assembly and pull rod. When the rear <b>wheel</b> meets that <b>bump</b> a moment later, it does the same in reverse, keeping the car level front to rear. When both springs are compressed on one side when travelling around a bend, or front and rear <b>wheels</b> hit <b>bumps</b> simultaneously, the equal and opposite forces applied to the front and rear spring assemblies reduce the interconnection. It reduces pitching, which is a particular problem of soft car suspension.|$|R

50|$|This system {{provides}} many advantages over other suspension systems. For example, in solid axle suspension systems, when one <b>wheel</b> hits a <b>bump,</b> it affects both wheels. This will compromise traction, smoothness of the ride, and could also cause a dangerous wheel shimmy when moving at high speeds. With independent suspension systems, the bump primarily affects only the contacted wheel. This offers many advantages such as greater ride comfort, better traction, and safer, more stable vehicles {{on and off}} the road (Longhurst 1).|$|R
30|$|The Bell Crank {{system is}} the one {{with a pair of}} wheels on a bell crank, each bogie {{connected}} by a short arm and lever to a central spring running the tank length [9]. This system had too much interconnection but decent travel length and tended to make the tank sway back and forth a lot in motion. The single and double Torsion Bar system is a common modern-type tank suspension and can be found today on many fast track layers. The original structure and concept appeared on the German tiger tanks [10]. A steel bar runs under the bottom of the tank and twists with a short trailing arm connected to it and carrying a wheel. As the <b>wheels</b> hit <b>bumps,</b> the bar twists to absorb the impact. This system is compact, light, simple to manufacture and can provide decent travel length.|$|R
40|$|In many {{fields of}} {{technology}} when calculating the strength there are {{options available to}} choose design cases and loads in compliance with different operating conditions. In the automotive industry {{there are no such}} standards yet. This is due to both a variety of operating conditions, and a complexity of calculating the actual loads. K. Ert`s article {{is considered to be a}} pioneering work in this regard. There the author makes a hypothesis of the linear dependence of torque acting on the car, and of the height of bumps in the road. All formulas were obtained for vehicles with the leaf spring suspensions. An appearing entire class of new cars made it necessary to generalize the experience. This paper proposes an engineering method for calculating the vertical loads acting on the car when bumping in the road. We derive general formulas to calculate the height of the road bumps (irregularities) on the way of a running car with various types of suspension. A dump truck BELAZ with various types nonlinear of suspension has been used to test the obtained formulas. The results analysis has shown that under equal conditions a car with dependent rear suspension will bear the lower loads than its prototype with a different type of suspension. The paper presents the relationships between the hights of bumps, which cause an equivalent load when different <b>wheels</b> <b>bump</b> against them. It shows a relation between the loads acting on the car when bumping against the same road irregularity by different wheels. The practical significance of the equations is the possibility to calculate loads in various cases in the road using the one-test results. A comparative results analysis of analytical calculation of loads and numerical experiments is based on the nonlinear model of the vehicle. The proposed method is an effective tool for the rapid analysis of loads in the design and fine-tuning the car. </p...|$|R
50|$|Bump steer {{causes a}} vehicle to turn itself when one <b>wheel</b> hits a <b>bump</b> or falls down into a hole or rut. Excessive bump steer {{increases}} tire wear and makes the vehicle more difficult to handle on rough roads. For example, if the front left wheel rolls over a bump it will compress the suspension on that corner and automatically rotate to the left (toe out), causing the car to turn itself left momentarily without any input from the steering wheel. Another example, is that when most vehicles become airborne their front wheels will noticeably toe in.|$|R
50|$|Each {{displacer}} unit {{contains a}} rubber spring, and damping {{is achieved by}} the displaced fluid passing through rubber valves. The displaced fluid passes to the displacer of the paired wheel, thus providing a dynamic interaction between front and rear wheels. When a front <b>wheel</b> encounters a <b>bump</b> fluid is transferred to the corresponding rear displacer then lowers the rear wheel, hence lifting the rear, minimising pitch associated with the bump. Naturally the reverse occurs when it is a rear wheel that encounters a bump. This effect is particularly good on small cars as their shorter wheelbases are more affected by pitching.|$|R

Ryan Farquhar, who was directly behind Finnegan on the track, said that the rear tyre of Finnegan's bike was covered in oil. On 7 May 2008, Finnegan's funeral took place in his hometown of Lusk. About 2,000 motorcyclists travelled to Lusk to attend.|$|R
40|$|A {{significant}} {{distinction between}} competitive mountain bikes {{is whether they}} have a suspension system. Research studies indicate that a suspension system gives advantages, {{but it is difficult}} to quantify the benefits because they depend on so many variables, including the physiology and psychology of the cyclist, the roughness of the track and the design of the suspension system. A laboratory based test rig has been built that allows the number of variables in the system to be reduced and test conditions to be controlled. The test rig simulates regular impacts of the rear <b>wheel</b> with <b>bumps</b> in a rolling road. The physiological variables of oxygen consumption and heart rate were measured, together with speeds and forces at various points in the system. Physiological and mechanical test results both confirm a significant benefit in using a suspension system on the simulated rough track, with oxygen consumption reduced by around 30 % and power transmitted through the pedals reduced by 30 % to 60 %.

The PDF units works in a similar way, except that they rely entirely on the compression stroke itself. The valves are spring-loaded so if the <b>wheel</b> hits a <b>bump,</b> they bounce off their seats and restore the flow of oil {{for a moment to}} allow the suspension to absorb the shock.|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates how perceivable haptic {{feedback}} patterns are using an actuated surface on a steering wheel. Six solenoids were embedded along {{the surface of}} the <b>wheel,</b> creating three <b>bumps</b> under each palm. The solenoids can be used to create a range of different tactile patterns. As a result of the design recommendation by Gallace et al. [Gallace 2006 a] maximally four of the six solenoids were actuated simultaneously, resulting in 57 patterns to test. A simulated driving study was conducted to investigate (1) the optimal number of actuated solenoids and (2) the most perceivable haptic patterns. A relationship between number of actuated solenoids and pattern identification rate was established. Perception accuracy drops above three active solenoids. Haptic patterns mirrored symmetrically on both hands were perceived more accurately. Practical applications for displaying tactile messages on the steering wheel are e. g. dead angles, upcoming road conditions, navigation information (i. e. conveying information discretely to the driver) ...|$|R
50|$|Historically, {{the first}} mass {{production}} car with {{front to rear}} mechanical interconnected suspension was the 1948 Citroën 2CV. The suspension of the 2CV was extremely soft—the longitudinal link was making pitch softer instead of making roll stiffer. It relied on extreme antidive and antisquat geometries to compensate for that. This redunded into a softer axle crossing stiffness that anti-roll bars would have otherwise compromised. The leading arm / trailing arm swinging arm, fore-aft linked suspension system together with inboard front brakes had a much smaller unsprung weight than existing coil spring or leaf designs. The interconnection transmitted some of the force deflecting a front wheel up over a bump, to push the rear wheel down on the same side. When the rear <b>wheel</b> met that <b>bump</b> a moment later, it did the same in reverse, keeping the car level front to rear. The 2CV had a design brief {{to be able to}} be driven at speed over a ploughed field. It originally featured friction dampers and tuned mass dampers. Later models had tuned mass dampers at the front with telescopic dampers/shock absorbers front and rear.|$|R
50|$|This {{system was}} in {{development}} for 25 years. The damper fluid contains metallic particles. Through the onboard computer, the dampers' compliance characteristics {{are controlled by}} an electromagnet. Essentially, increasing the current flow into the damper magnetic circuit increases the circuit magnetic flux. This in turn causes the metal particles to change their alignment, which increases fluid viscosity thereby raising the compression/rebound rates, while a decrease softens {{the effect of the}} dampers by aligning the particles in the opposite direction. If we imagine the metal particles as dinner plates then whilst aligned so they are on edge - viscosity is minimised. At {{the other end of the}} spectrum they will be aligned at 90 degrees so flat. Thus making the fluid much more viscous. It is the electric field produced by the electromagnet that changes the alignment of the metal particles. Information from wheel sensors (about suspension extension), steering, acceleration sensors - and other data, is used to calculate the optimizal stiffness at that point in time. The fast reaction of the system (milliseconds) allows, for instance, making a softer passing by a single <b>wheel</b> over a <b>bump</b> in the road at a particular instant in time.|$|R
40|$|In {{vehicles}} problem happens {{while driving}} on bumping road condition. The {{objective of this}} project is to design and analyze the performance of Shock absorber by varying the wire diameter of the coil spring. The Shock absorber {{which is one of}} the Suspension systems is designed mechanically to handle shock impulse and dissipate kinetic energy. It reduces the amplitude of disturbances leading to increase in comfort and improved ride quality. The spring is compressed quickly when the <b>wheel</b> strikes the <b>bump.</b> The compressed spring rebound to its normal dimension or normal loaded length which causes the body to be lifted. The spring goes down below its normal height when the weight of the vehicle pushes the spring down. This, in turn, causes the spring to rebound again. The spring bouncing process occurs over and over every less each time, until the up-and-down movement finally stops. The vehicle handling becomes very difficult and leads to uncomfortable ride when bouncing is allowed uncontrolled. Hence, the designing of spring in a suspension system is very crucial. The analysis is done by considering bike mass, loads, and no of persons seated on bike. Comparison is done by varying the wire diameter of the coil spring to verify the best dimension for the spring in shock absorber. Modeling and Analysis is done using Pro/ENGINEER and ANSYS respectively...|$|R
60|$|So {{they turned}} at the store, much to the disgust of the plodding sorrel, {{who thought he was}} going {{directly}} home, and they soon reached the road that led through the woods. This was hard and sandy, as are many of the roads through the forests {{in that part of the}} country, and it would have been a very good driving road, had it not been for the occasional protrusion of tree roots, which gave the <b>wheels</b> a little <b>bump,</b> and for the branches which, now and then, hung down somewhat too low for the comfort of a lady and gentleman, riding in a rather high spring-wagon without a cover. But Lawrence drove slowly, and so the root bumps were not noticed; and when the low-hanging boughs were on his side, he lifted them so that his companion's head could pass under and, when they happened to be on her side, Annie ducked her head, and her hat was never brushed off. But, at times, they drove quite a distance without overhanging boughs, and the pine trees, surrounded by their smooth carpet of brown spines, gave forth a spicy fragrance in the warm, but sparkling air; the oak trees stood up still dark and green; while the chestnuts were all dressed in rich yellow, with the chinquepin bushes by the roadside imitating them in color, as they tried to do in fruit. Sometimes a spray of purple flowers could be seen among the trees, and great patches of sunlight which, here and there, came through the thinning foliage, fell, now upon the brilliantly scarlet leaves of a sweet-gum, and now upon the polished and brown-red dress of a neighboring black-gum.|$|R
40|$|A {{suspension}} system or shock absorber is a mechanical device designed {{to smooth out}} or damp shock impulse, and dissipate kinetic energy. The shock absorbers duty is to absorb or dissipate energy. In a vehicle, it reduces the effect of traveling over rough ground, leading to improved ride quality, and increase in comfort due to substantially reduced amplitude of disturbances. When a vehicle is traveling on a level road and the <b>wheels</b> strike a <b>bump,</b> the spring is compressed quickly. The compressed spring will attempt to return to its normal loaded length and, in so doing, will rebound past its normal height, causing the body to be lifted. The weight of the vehicle will then push the spring down below its normal loaded height. This, in turn, causes the spring to rebound again. This bouncing process is repeated over and over, a little less each time, until the up-and-down movement finally stops. If bouncing is allowed to go uncontrolled, it will not only cause an uncomfortable ride but will make handling of the vehicle very difficult. The design of spring in {{suspension system}} is very important. In this project a shock absorber is designed and a 3 D model is created using Pro/Engineer. The model is also changed by changing {{the thickness of the}} spring. Structural analysis and modal analysis are done on the shock absorber by varying material for spring, Spring Steel and Beryllium Copper. The analysis is done by considering loads, bike weight, single person and 2 persons. Structural analysis is done to validate the strength and modal analysis is done to determine the displacements for different frequencies for number of modes. Comparison is done for two materials to verify best material for spring in Shock absorber. Modeling is done in Pro/ENGINEER and analysis is done in ANSYS. Pro/ENGINEER is the standard in 3...|$|R
60|$|I find from my ever-faithful note-book {{that the}} {{landscape}} {{seemed to grow}} drearier as we got away from Madrid, but {{this may have been}} the effect of the waning day: a day which at its brightest had been dim from recurrent rain and incessant damp. The gloom was not relieved by the long stops at the frequent stations, though the stops were good for getting one's breath, and for trying to plan greater control over one's activities when the train should be going on again. The stations themselves were not so alluring that we were not willing to get away from them; and we were glad to get away from them by train, instead of by mule-team over the rainy levels to the towns that glimmered along the horizon two or three miles off. There had been nothing to lift the heart in the sight of two small boys ready perched on one horse, or of a priest difficultly mounting another in his long robe. At the only station which I can remember having any town about it a large number of our passengers left the train, and I realized that they were commuters like those who might have been leaving it at some soaking suburb of Long Island or New Jersey. In the sense of human brotherhood which the fact inspired I was not so lonely as I might have been, when we resumed our gloomy progress, with all that punctilio which custom demands of a Spanish way-train. First the station-master rings a bell of alarming note hanging on the wall, and the mozos run along the train shutting the car doors. After an interval some other official sounds a pocket whistle, and then there is still time for a belated passenger to find his car and scramble aboard. When the ensuing pause prolongs itself until you think the train has decided to remain all day, or all night, and several passengers have left it again, the locomotive rouses itself and utters a peremptory screech. This really means going, but your doubt has not been fully overcome when the <b>wheels</b> begin to <b>bump</b> under your compartment, and you set your teeth and clutch your seat, and otherwise prepare yourself for the renewal of your acrobatic feats. I may not get the order of the signals for departure just right, but I am sure of their number. Perhaps the Sud-Express starts with less, but the Sud-Express is partly French.|$|R
5000|$|The inaugural NASCAR era season held 12 events, {{beginning}} on March 26 at Caraway Speedway and ended on October 29 at Ace Speedway. The inaugural {{event for the}} NASCAR Whelen Southern Modified Tour was the Southern Modified Tour 150 at Caraway Speedway on March 26. Burt Myers won the first pole for the NASCAR era of the southern-based Modified Tour. While leading the event Jay Hedgecock had to pulled his car into the pits on the 65th lap with an engine problem. Ted Christopher, a star driver on the northeastern-based NASCAR Whelen Modified Tour, inherited the lead from Hedgecock and paced {{the field for the}} remaining laps {{on his way to the}} victory. In the April 16th race at Caraway, the tour's 3rd race under NASCAR sanction, Burt Myers led the first 145 laps but fellow rival Junior Miller stayed on his back bumper for most of the race. Miller and Myers bumped and banged and racinged each other hard lap after lap. Miller made the pass for the lead on Myers with only 5 laps remaining to score the victory. At the July 1 event at Caraway Bud Pole winner Jay Hedgecock was on point. Hedgecock had lapping all but the top 8 cars, but Brian Crammer was coming as he had worked his way from his 11th place starting spot to 2nd by the halfway point. Crammer had been chasing down Hedgecock during the 2nd half and caught Hedgecock with 20 laps to go. Crammer began putting hard pressure on Hedgecock with 10 to go and with 5 to go made a move on Hedgecock coming off of turn 2. Hedgecock and Crammer <b>bumped</b> <b>wheels</b> resulting in Crammer being sent spinning while Hedgecock kept the lead. Crammer retaliated under the caution by hitting Hedgecock's car but Hedgecock was able to continue. A crash during the green-white-checker attempt sent the race over its scheduled distance. Hedgecock's car ran out of gas before the race was red flagged during track clean up. Brian Loftin inherited the lead for the next another green-white-checkered attempt and held off Tim Brown for the win. Burt Myers was the fastest in qualifying for the Advance Auto Parts 199 at Bowman Gray Stadium, but drew the 5th starting position. This was the tour's first visit to Bowman Gray Stadium, the track many tour drivers call home, since 1992. Hedgecock led the first 71 laps until a spinning car hit the infield and shot dirt onto the track coming out of the 4th turn. Hedgecock's car skidded in the dirt and careened into the outside guardrail as Tim Brown zipped past into the lead. Brown stayed there until the lap 137 when Myers squeezed inside and completed a pass. Myers held off the win-hungry Tim Brown in the end. The Made in America Whelen 300 at Martinsville Speedway was a combo race for both Modified Tours. The Event was the first NASCAR Modified Tour event held at the track since 2002 and the first night race held at the historic [...]526-mile track. Ted Christopher won the overall event as Brian Loftin was the top-finishing driver from the Southern Tour, finishing 12th, but credited as first-place towards the Southern Modified Tour. A special Twin 100-lap event was held at Ace Speedway as a Labor Day doubleheader. Burt Myers won the first 100-lap race while Junior Miller got the win in the second 100-lap race. Jay Hedgecock won his 4th Pole of the season at the 6th and final season visit to Caraway Speedway. Hedgecock lead 115 of the first 133 laps and looked to be closing in on his first win of the season. Hedgecock's season of bad luck continued as during a caution period on lap 134 Hedgecock came into the pits with engine trouble ending his night. Brian Loftin held off a hard-charging Junior Miller over the final laps to win. Jay Hedgecock finally avoided any bad luck at the season finale, Whelen 150, at Ace Speedway. Hedgecock lead all 150 lap and won easily over 2nd place Brian Loftin. Junior Miller, By finishing 8th, won the 2005 Inaugural NASCAR Whelen Southern Modified Tour Championship.
