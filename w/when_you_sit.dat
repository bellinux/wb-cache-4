500|$|This {{would cause}} {{problems}} for the studio, Universal and partner MGM. [...] "The studio is just back from the holiday and is regrouping based on the news, and has no cohesive game plan at the moment," [...] said Kevin Misher, Universal's President of Production. Misher added that, [...] "It {{was one of those}} moments <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> down and think, 'Can Clarice be looked upon as James Bond for instance? A character who is replaceable?' Or was Jodie Foster Clarice Starling, and the audience will not accept anyone else?" [...] Foster said in December 1999 that the characterization of Starling in Hannibal had [...] "negative attributes" [...] and [...] "betrayed" [...] the original character.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "How Orlo Got His Book", he {{described}} Orlo, a fictional, archetypal young {{child who was}} turned off of reading by the poor selection of simple reading material. To save Orlo the frustration, Geisel decided {{to write a book}} for children like Orlo but found the task [...] "not dissimilar to... being lost with a witch in a tunnel of love". He tried to write a story called [...] "The Queen Zebra" [...] but found that both words did not appear on the list. In fact, like Geisel wrote in [...] "My Hassle with the First Grade Language", the letters [...] "q" [...] and [...] "z" [...] did not appear on the list at all. He then tried to write a story about a bird, without using the word bird as it did not appear on the list. He decided to call it a [...] "wing thing" [...] instead but struggled as he discovered that it [...] "couldn't have legs or a beak or a tail. Neither a left foot or a right foot." [...] On his approach to writing The Cat in the Hat he wrote, [...] "The method I used is the same method you use <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> down to make apple stroodle [...] without stroodles." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{consists}} of a simplistic concept [...] a One Direction recording session. In a November 2012 interview with MTV News, Arnell {{said he did not}} want to make it about anything more than that, [...] "When I first heard the track, the mix on it was so simple and so pure and you could hear all the qualities of the voices on the track, I just wanted to come up with something that when the viewer watched it, it was almost like sitting there listening to the boys sing the track." [...] Arnell subsequently developed the idea of a recording studio setting, thinking that it was [...] "the most pure way to do it". He wanted to make the music video as [...] "uncontrived as possible" [...] without [...] "any other bullsh-- or effects in the way of it." [...] While Arnell conceded that music video may seem like a simple concept, the shoot itself took over twelve hours to complete and said that it was [...] "one of the hardest things I've ever done." [...] The group performed it [...] "over and over again because I was just trying to get different shots, different angles, different qualities." [...] As for the decision to shoot the video in black-and-white, Arnell felt it best captured the essence of the ballad. He also noted that was his intention to give the music video the feeling as if One Direction are singing it right to you, [...] "It's purely about the clarity of it. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> there watching it, it's almost like these little bits of eye contact [...] you really feel like the guys are singing it to you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Thee may {{be right}} about Davy, but I am only a prudent old woman, and have taken much {{pleasure}} in privately knitting this light wrap to wear <b>when</b> <b>thee</b> <b>sits</b> in the porch, for the evenings will soon grow chilly. My son {{did not know what}} to get, and finally decided that flowers would suit thee best; so he made a bunch of those thee loves, and would toss it in as if he was a boy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, my man of affairs, join us a hand!" [...] {{says the}} doctor to me. [...] "I have known the time <b>when</b> <b>you</b> would <b>sit</b> from noon until supper." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "You should {{bend your}} knees from the thighs down. [...] As your knees bend, {{the upper part of}} the trunk remains {{normally}} erect, just as it does <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> down in a chair. In golf, the sit-down motion is more like lowering yourself onto a spectator-sports-stick. [...] Think of the seat of the stick as being about two inches or so below your buttocks." ...|$|E
2500|$|Then verse 7 goes on {{to remind}} the {{community}} to remember all the commandments and to [...] "teach them diligently to your children and speak of them <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> down and when you walk, when you lie down and when you rise", to recite the words of God when retiring or rising; to bind those words [...] "on thy arm and thy head" [...] (classically Jewish oral tradition interprets as tefillin), and to [...] "inscribe them on the door-posts of your house and on your gates" [...] (referring to mezuzah).|$|E
2500|$|Overall {{critical}} {{reception for}} Mega Man V has been average to positive. While {{many aspects of}} the game were commended, critics found very little change from previous installments in the series. VideoGames summarized, [...] "If you don't have a Mega Man game for your Game Boy, this one is a good as any. It's entertaining...it's Mega Man. If you're thinking 'rehash', you might be right and it's still a pretty fun game, though." [...] Nintendo Power was impressed by its gameplay and graphics, but felt that the game is too short, [...] "especially <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> down with the Super Game Boy and cruise". GamePro was contrastingly unimpressed with the controls on the SNES, considering the use of Game Boy much simpler.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You needn't go yet, need you?' said Gerald, glancing {{quickly at}} the clock.' It is early yet. I'll walk down with <b>you</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> go. <b>Sit</b> down, don't hurry away.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dis {{place for}} house," [...] said Maximus, pausing near a smooth, level {{part of the}} lake. [...] "You stop look to me," [...] he added, turning to the little girl, who gazed up in his large face with an {{expression}} half of wonder and half of fun. [...] "When <b>you</b> cold, run; <b>when</b> <b>you</b> hot, <b>sit</b> in sled and look at me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't {{any time}} for reading, except <b>when</b> <b>you</b> let me <b>sit</b> here, and on Sundays I'm on my bicycle or {{down the river}} all day. There's nothing wrong about the hero, is there?" ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the sixth}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Moses {{imparted}} God's instructions, the Shema and V'ahavta, saying: [...] "Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God {{with all your}} heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might. And these words, which I command you this day, shall be upon your heart; and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when thou rise up. And you shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes. And you shall write them upon the doorposts of your house, and upon your gates." [...] A closed portion ( [...] , setumah) ends here.|$|E
6000|$|As we {{descended the}} stairs, Eve said,--"You must sit beside me to-night, Geo'ge. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> {{opposite}} you gaze {{too much and}} make me uncomfortable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You’re {{too tall}} to stand up, Lord Lambeth,” Mrs. Westgate pronounced. “You {{approach}} the normal only <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> down. Be so good as {{to get a}} chair.” ...|$|E
50|$|Verse three {{describes}} school, how <b>when</b> home-schooled <b>you</b> can <b>sit</b> happily and read. At school, {{there is}} no freedom; you will learn what you are told to learn, nothing more, nothing less. School cannot delight him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hear him! 'cried the Captain. 'Good morality! Wal'r, my lad. Train up a fig-tree {{in the way}} {{it should}} go, and <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are old <b>sit</b> under the shade on it.

2500|$|Some of {{his most}} famous numbers are [...] "How Can I Tell You I Love <b>You</b> (<b>When</b> You're <b>Sitting</b> On My Face)" [...] and [...] "They Ain't Makin' Jews Like Jesus Anymore," [...] a song in which Kinky {{verbally}} and physically beats up a drunken white racist who berates blacks, Jews, Italians, Greeks, and Sigma Nus in a bar.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{too tall}} to stand up, Lord Lambeth," [...] Mrs. Westgate observed. [...] "You are only {{tolerable}} <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> down. Be so good as {{to get a}} chair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Good-bye, then," [...] {{concluded}} Irma, as {{she finally}} {{turned toward the}} door, [...] "don't crumple your petticoats <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> down, and don't go too near the hearth, there is some grease upon it from this morning's breakfast. Don't let anyone see you and wait quietly for my return." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There is no mystery, my dear madam," [...] said he, smiling. [...] "The {{left arm}} of your jacket is spattered with mud in {{no less than}} seven places. The marks are {{perfectly}} fresh. There is no vehicle save a dog-cart which throws up mud in that way, and then only <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> on the left-hand side of the driver." ...|$|E
5000|$|Maxim {{gave the}} game {{a score of}} four stars out of five and said, [...] "Fun as this game is to play, the best moments come <b>when</b> <b>you</b> just <b>sit</b> back and observe. Wonderfully acted, written, and {{directed}} motion-capture cut scenes play like the Snatch follow-up Guy Ritchie should have made, {{further evidence of the}} narrowing gap between video game and movie production values." [...] However, Detroit Free Press gave it a score of two stars out of four and stated, [...] "The underworld figures are colorful, and the language characters use has a life of its own. But the game's design is bollocks." [...] The Sydney Morning Herald also gave it a similar score of two-and-a-half stars out of five and said, [...] "The artificial intelligence of other characters is often dim. Enemies are often oblivious to your nearby presence, while colleagues provide little genuine assistance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{would give}} a lot, Steve,” the first mate said, when they had been out a fortnight, “if I could work things out as you do. I have gone {{over and over again}} to fellows who {{advertise}} that they teach navigation, but it is of no use, I can’t make head or tail of all the letters and zigzigs and things. I have tried and I have tried till my head ached, but the more I study it the more fogged I get about it. There does not seem to me to be any sense in the thing, and <b>when</b> I see <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> down and figure away with all those letters and things, it beats me altogether.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will never}} do that, Bill; {{but you might}} settle down in Rochester, and buy half a dozen barges, with a tip-top one you would sail {{yourself}}. You might {{have a couple of}} men and a cabin forward, and a nice roomy place for yourself and me aft; and you could just steer <b>when</b> <b>you</b> liked, or <b>sit</b> down and smoke your pipe and watch her going through the fleet as we worked through the swatchway. That would be more your sort, Bill, and mine too. I know you have money enough laid by to get such a barge." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And to bear now and then: crops wiped out--I've {{lost two}} of them. The work never slackens, except in winter, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> {{shivering}} beside the stove, if you're not hauling in building logs or cordwood through the arctic frost. At night it's deadly silent, unless there's a blizzard howling; the plains are very lonely {{when the snow}} lies deep. Don't you think you're better off in England, taking it all 'round?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{see that}} old felled tree there. I {{was sitting on}} it the day before {{yesterday}} and thinking of you. Will you come there and sit with me on it? <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> on it you get a view, oh! a perfectly lovely English view, just a bit of the house and those clumps of trees and the valley away there with the lily pond. I'd love to have you in my memory of it...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will get}} a handsomer pair of sandals by and by," [...] said the old woman, with a kindly look out of her {{beautiful}} brown eyes. [...] "Only let King Pelias {{get a glimpse of}} that bare foot, and you shall see him turn as pale as ashes, I promise you. There is your path. Go along, my good Jason, and my blessing go with you. And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> on your throne remember the old woman whom you helped over the river." ...|$|E
5000|$|At Christianity Today Andrea Dawn Goforth {{claimed that}} the duo is [...] "folkier than ever here" [...] and the album {{contains}} [...] "backbeat rhythm on songs throughout" [...] with [...] "tight harmonies and poppy hooks". Julie Porter of Cross Rhythms alluded to how the listener [...] "will hear a tinge Nashville, Tennessee in the crafted, acoustic pop" [...] that [...] "occasionally though a rock feel shows through". Jesus Freak Hideout's Logan Leasure evoked that [...] "Everything Is Different gives the duo a chance {{to turn up the}} creativity level once again and reconnect with their fans." [...] Suzanne Physick of Louder Than the Music told that [...] "the lyrics carry this album though and there are moments <b>when</b> <b>you</b> will <b>sit</b> up and pay attention because there's a cute hook in a melody or a really great harmony {{but for the most part}} this album is well executed country-tinged rock with more passion than creativity." ...|$|R
5000|$|Greg Roberts {{has said}} in {{interview}} that [...] "You hear something within a tune which excites you and which {{you feel that you}} can do something with. I like having a base to start from and a musical or a melodic idea that conjures up and puts you in a certain mood. I will always use samples. They start off most of our songs. When it comes to dialogue, I think the best dialogue comes from simply watching a lot of films and thinking, [...] "That sounds nice." [...] and [...] "It is fun working with samples ... except <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have to <b>sit</b> down with people and work out deals." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pray try {{to control}} yourself." [...] As Iris spoke, she pointed kindly to a chair. [...] "There is {{something}} that I want to say <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are composed again. I won't hurry you; I won't look at <b>you.</b> <b>Sit</b> down, Fanny." ...|$|R
60|$|Now the {{carbonic}} acid in the breath which {{comes out of}} our mouth is warm, lighter than the air, and rises to the ceiling; and therefore in any unventilated room full of people, there is a layer of foul air along the ceiling. You might soon test that for yourselves, if you could mount a ladder and put your heads there aloft. You do test it for yourselves <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> in the galleries of churches and theatres, where the air is palpably more foul, and therefore more injurious, than down below.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes, of course," [...] she answered, {{rubbing her}} {{handkerchief}} into her eyes. [...] "But you don't {{know that it}} was despair; and he was quite happy in his apathy; and as it is, you've got him on your hands; and if he's going to come here every night and stay till morning, it will kill you. You know you're not strong; and you get so excited <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> up talking. Look how flushed your cheeks are, now, and your eyes--as big! You won't sleep a wink to-night,--I know you won't." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'In {{the name}} of {{goodness}} get that bugbear out of your head,' said Undy. 'Whatever good it might have done you {{to think of that}} some time ago, it can do you no good now.' There was a bitter truth in this which made Alaric's heart sink low within his breast. 'Wherever the money came from, whose property it may have been or be, it has been used; and now your only safety is in making the best use of it. A little daring, a little audacity--it is that which ruins men. <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> down to play brag, you must brag it out, or lose your money.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Busy!" [...] said Elinor. [...] "There must be {{something}} even more unusual than that, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> are too low spirited to keep up a quarrel with me. Why dont <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> on the easy chair, or sprawl on the ottoman, after your manner?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You too--you bid me go? Did I bid <b>you</b> go <b>when</b> <b>you</b> came to me? Did I {{not tell}} <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> down? Was I not polite? Did I send for a police, or talk of lock-up 'ouse to you? No. It is English that do these things--only English." ...|$|R
50|$|Well, {{if you are}} a high-priced man, {{you will}} do exactly as this man tells you to-morrow, from morning till night. <b>When</b> he tells <b>you</b> to pick up a pig and walk, you pick it up and <b>you</b> walk, and <b>when</b> he tells <b>you</b> to <b>sit</b> down and rest, <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> down. <b>You</b> do that right {{straight}} through the day. And what's more, no back talk. Now a high-priced man does just what he's told to do, and no back talk. Do <b>you</b> understand that? <b>When</b> this man tells you to walk, <b>you</b> walk; <b>when</b> he tells <b>you</b> to <b>sit</b> down, <b>you</b> <b>sit</b> down, and <b>you</b> don't talk back at him. Now you come on to work here to-morrow morning and I'll know before night whether you are really a high-priced man or not.|$|R
