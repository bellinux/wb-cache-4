Whales are next winched onto the factory ship through a slipway at the stern of the vessel. On the flensing deck several workers use specialized tools to butcher the whale. Usable product is delivered to the lower decks of the ship for further processing and refrigerated storage. Non usable product is dumped back into the ocean.|$|E
25|$|The first post-war {{expedition}} was {{overseen by}} a US naval officer, Lieutenant David McCracken, and observed by Australian Kenneth Coonan. Coonan expressed disapproval of McCracken in his reports of violated regulations and waste dumped {{over the side}} when the fleet began killing whales faster than they could be processed. McCracken even briefly joined in whaling with the Japanese crew of a <b>whale</b> <b>catcher</b> and detailed the trip in his 1948 book, Four Months on a Jap Whaler.|$|E
25|$|Factory {{ships were}} not used by Japan until the 1930s. As whale catches diminished in coastal waters, Japan looked to Antarctica. Toyo Hogei K.K. {{purchased}} the Norwegian factory ship, Antarctic, renaming it the Tonan Maru in 1934. Refrigerator ships were sent along to freeze and transport the meat back to Japan. By capitalizing on both the meat and oil of whales, the Japanese industry continued to out-compete other whaling nations. Improvements in technology such as the world's first diesel-powered <b>whale</b> <b>catcher,</b> the Seki Maru, also increased the capacity to take whales. In the years building up to World War II, the Germans purchased whale oil from Japan and both nations used it in preparation for war.|$|E
50|$|At first, <b>whale</b> <b>catchers</b> either {{brought the}} whales they killed to a whaling station or factory ship {{anchored}} in a sheltered bay or inlet. Later, {{with the development}} of the slipway at the ship's stern, <b>whale</b> <b>catchers</b> were able to transfer their catch to factory ships operating in the open sea.|$|R
50|$|During {{a five-day}} period in late September 1968, the Soviet factory ship Vladivostok and its fleet of <b>whale</b> <b>catchers</b> {{illegally}} caught sixty-six balaenids (likely bowheads) in the bay.|$|R
5000|$|The Shōnan Maru 2 {{is similar}} in design and {{appearance}} to <b>whale</b> <b>catchers</b> used by the ICR such as the Yūshin Maru series, the primary external differences being {{the presence of a}} crane near the aft end of her superstructure used to launch and recover rigid-hulled inflatable boats (craft not carried aboard other ICR <b>whale</b> <b>catchers),</b> minor differences {{in the design of the}} bridge section and forward catwalk, and the absence of a structure on her prow used to recover fired harpoons. Originally, the Shōnan Maru 2 sported the same blue & white paint scheme as the ICR <b>whale</b> <b>catchers,</b> but in late 2011 she was repainted to an overall white scheme, the word [...] "Research" [...] on the side of her superstructure being replaced with [...] "Government of Japan", this of course was an obvious lie, the ship's fleet is a horrific killing machine killing whales in the sanitary of the southern ocean.|$|R
500|$|At {{the advent}} of World War II, the Royal Canadian Navy greatly desired to build naval class warships. However, Canadian ship {{building}} yards were not capable of building such vessels {{and at the time}} it was impossible to buy such ships from Britain as its capacity was taken up entirely by its own defence needs. It was decided that a modified <b>whale</b> <b>catcher</b> design could be built by Canadian yards which could later be traded with Britain for [...] destroyers. The barter scheme eventually failed, but the Canadian Navy had already ordered the whale catchers. [...] Sixty-four ships were originally ordered and these were built between 1939–1940, becoming the basis of the RCN corvette fleet.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1939, {{with the}} risk of war with Nazi Germany increasing, {{it was clear to}} the Royal Navy that it needed more escort ships to counter the threat from Kriegsmarine U-boats. One {{particular}} concern was the need to protect shipping off the east coast of Britain. What was needed was something larger and faster than trawlers, but still cheap enough to be built in large numbers, preferably at small merchant shipyards, as larger yards were already busy. To meet this requirement, the Smiths Dock Company of Middlesbrough, a specialist in the design and build of fishing vessels, offered a development of its 700-ton, [...] <b>whale</b> <b>catcher</b> Southern Pride. They were intended as small convoy escort ships that could be produced quickly and cheaply in large numbers. Despite naval planners' intentions that they be deployed for coastal convoys, their long range meant that they became the mainstay of Mid-Ocean Escort Force convoy protection {{during the first half of}} the war.|$|E
2500|$|Only four whales were {{reportedly}} {{caught in the}} Bay of Biscay in the 19th century, {{and at least one}} more was struck but lost and another chased unsuccessfully. The first was caught off Hondarribia in 1805, the second off San Sebastian in 1854, the third off Getaria-Zarautz in 1878, and the last off San Sebastian in 1893. In January 1854, three whales (said to be a mother and her two calves) entered the bay of San Sebastian. Only one of the calves was caught. The whale caught off Getaria-Zarautz was taken on 11 February. Several boats were sent out of both ports, along with one from Orio. The whale was struck with a harpoon from Getaria, but the line belonged to Zarautz. This resulted in a lawsuit, which led to the whale being left to rot ashore. The unpleasant smell of the decomposing carcass led to it being blown up. In 1844, a whale was struck off Zarautz, but, after being towed for six hours, the line was broken, and the whale was lost with two harpoons and three lances in its body. Another whale was seen off Getaria early in the morning on 25 July 1850, but the harpooner missed his mark, and the whale swam away to the northwest. On 14 May 1901, a 12m (39ft) right whale was killed by fishermen using dynamite off the town of Orio, an event reflected in a folk [...] popularized by singer-songwriter Benito Lertxundi. A local festival representing this catch have been held on 5 year intervals. Only a few more sightings of right whales were made in the area, the last in 1977, when the crew of a Spanish <b>whale</b> <b>catcher</b> sighted one at about 43° N and 10° 30' W.|$|E
50|$|During a four day {{period in}} mid-September 1968, the Soviet factory ship Vladivostok and its fleet of <b>whale</b> <b>catchers</b> {{illegally}} caught over sixty balaenids (likely bowheads) in and near Academy Bay.|$|R
50|$|The steam-schooner California {{and her two}} <b>whale</b> <b>catchers</b> Hawk and Port Saunders {{operated}} off San Nicolas in 1932 and 1937, catching about 30 fin whales off {{the island}} from October to early December in the former year.|$|R
50|$|In 1852, Charles Melville Scammon, in the brig Mary Helen, hunted {{northern}} elephant {{seals and}} sea lions on Santa Barbara Island. In December 1934, the steam-schooner California {{spent a week}} anchored off the island, processing blue, fin, and sperm whales caught by her two steam-driven <b>whale</b> <b>catchers</b> Hawk and Port Saunders.|$|R

5000|$|Mikkelsen Peak (...) is, at 420 m, {{the highest}} {{peak of the}} Scullin Monolith in Mac. Robertson Land, Antarctica. In January and February 1931 several Norwegian <b>whale</b> <b>catchers,</b> {{exploring}} along this coast, made sketches of the shore from their vessels and named this mountain for Captain Klarius Mikkelsen, master of the Torlyn.|$|R
25|$|The {{shipbuilding}} firm of Smith's Dock Co., Middlesbrough {{were commissioned}} to construct two steel 92ft. diesel-powered <b>whale</b> <b>catchers</b> {{as well as}} fit a diesel auxiliary in the Sound of Jura. However, the diesel engine proved to be unreliable and felt to be too noisy in scaring off the whales, so {{was replaced by a}} steam engine.|$|R
50|$|With the {{commencement}} of unrestricted catching in 1883, the number of whaling stations increased from eight to sixteen, {{and the number of}} <b>whale</b> <b>catchers</b> from twelve to twenty-three. Catching material peaked in 1886-88 with an average of about thirty-one catchers operating each season, while peak catching was not reached until 1892-93 and 1896-98, when between 1,000 and 1,200 whales were caught each year.|$|R
50|$|The passage {{was named}} by Captain Skidsmo after his <b>whale</b> <b>catcher</b> Graham, {{which was the}} first to pass through it, on March 20, 1922.|$|E

50|$|It was {{surveyed}} in 1948 by ANARE (Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions), who named it for Bjarne Olsen, first mate on the <b>whale</b> <b>catcher</b> Kidalkey which visited {{the island in}} January 1929.|$|E
5000|$|The Minerva Rocks (...) are a {{small group}} of rocks lying off Chionis Island near Trinity Island, in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica. They were so named by whalers because the Minerva, one of the <b>whale</b> <b>catchers</b> of the British factory ship Pythia, went aground on these rocks in March 1922. The catcher was {{abandoned}} and, because of the heavy swell, became a total wreck.|$|R
25|$|Japan's pelagic whaling fleet, which {{annually}} hunts large {{whales in}} the Southern Ocean, {{consists of a}} number of ships for hunting and processing whale catch as well as securing the hunt against protests. During the 2009–10 season, the Japanese fleet included a factory ship, four <b>whale</b> <b>catchers</b> and two security patrol vessels. The Japanese self-imposed quota includes 935 minke, 50 fin and 50 humpback whales per season.|$|R
25|$|General Douglas MacArthur {{encouraged}} the surrendered Japan to continue whaling {{in order to}} provide a cheap source of meat to starving people (and millions of dollars in oil for the USA and Europe). The Japanese whaling industry quickly recovered as MacArthur authorized two tankers to be converted into factory ships, the Hashidate Maru and the Nisshin Maru. <b>Whale</b> <b>catchers</b> once again took blue whales, fins, humpbacks and sperm whales in the Antarctic and elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|Carlita Bay {{is named}} after the Carlita (or Little Carla), a <b>whale</b> <b>catcher</b> built in 1907 and owned by the Compañía Argentina de Pesca, who used it for sealing and for general {{transport}} work.|$|E
50|$|Sandefjord {{also has}} {{shipping}} traditions of tall sailing ships and steam ships. The full rigged sailing ship Christian Radich, three-masted barquentine Endurance, <b>whale</b> <b>catcher</b> Jason and Viking ship replica Viking {{were some of}} the many ships built by Framnæs Mekaniske Værksted.|$|E
50|$|Theodor Rock is a rock {{approximately}} {{midway between}} Annenkov Island and Pickersgill Islands, off the south coast of South Georgia.

40|$|Information on {{the diet}} of minke whales (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) in Greenland waters is reviewed. The {{knowledge}} {{is based on}} reports by <b>whale</b> <b>catchers</b> in Greenland, supplemented by limited scientific studies of stomach contents. The available material indicates that capelin (Mallotus villosus)  is the predominant prey item in Greenland waters, particularly in coastal areas. In offshore areas, sand eel (Ammodytes spp) is consumed rather frequently, and krill (euphausids) appears to play a certain role in some areas or periods...|$|R
5000|$|Hauken Rock (...) is a rock lying nearly 1 nmi km {{east of the}} Ornen Rocks and 2 nmi km {{northeast}} of Cape Melville, the eastern extremity of King George Island, in the South Shetland Islands. It was named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1960 from association with Ornen Rocks. Hauken and Ørnen, the first two modern <b>whale</b> <b>catchers,</b> accompanied the floating factory ship Admiralen to the South Shetland Islands in January-February 1906.|$|R
50|$|After {{the fall}} of Norway to Nazi Germany on 10 June 1940, the Norwegian whale factory ship Suderøy and her <b>whale</b> <b>catchers,</b> Suderøy IV (J03), Suderøy V (J04), Suderøy VI (J05) and Star XVI were ordered to sail to Halifax from Hampton Roads, where they had taken refuge. In June 1940, at Halifax, Suderøy IV, V and VI were {{chartered}} from the Norwegian government in exile by the Royal Canadian Navy, converted and commissioned as minesweepers.|$|R
50|$|Hercules Bay is a bay 0.5 nmi km wide, {{which lies}} 1 nmi km west-northwest of Cape Saunders {{along the north}} coast of South Georgia. It was named by Norwegian whalers after the Hercules (or Herkules), a <b>whale</b> <b>catcher</b> which had visited the bay.|$|E
50|$|In 1883 {{the first}} whaling station was {{established}} in Alptafjordur, Iceland. In the first season, using an 84 gross ton <b>whale</b> <b>catcher,</b> only eight whales were caught, but in the following season (1884) twenty-five were caught, {{all of which were}} blue whales, with the exception of two.|$|E
5000|$|Suderøy VI {{was built}} in Middlesbrough, UK, and {{launched}} in 1929 as Southern Gem. Served with the Halifax Local Defence Force from March 1941 until paid off in August 1945, {{and returned to her}} former owners to resume her occupation as <b>whale</b> <b>catcher.</b> Sunk January 1983.|$|E
25|$|During the Second World War Japan's whaling was {{significantly}} limited to more familiar hunting grounds, {{such as the}} Bonin Islands, to provide meat and oil for domestic and military use. Whaling there was halted in March, 1945 when the islands were taken by US forces. By November 1945 the whaling stations received permission to reopen; however, most whaling ships had been commandeered by the Japanese navy, {{and by the end}} of the war the factory ships and most of the <b>whale</b> <b>catchers</b> had been sunk.|$|R
50|$|He sent {{a larger}} ship, the 1,517 gross ton Admiralen, to Spitsbergen the {{following}} season (1904). She {{returned with a}} cargo of 5,100 barrels from 154 whales. By 1905 there were eight companies operating around Spitsbergen and Bear Island, while seven (using fifteen <b>whale</b> <b>catchers)</b> were there in 1906-07. The peak had been reached in 1905, when 559 whales (337 blue) were caught to produce 18,660 barrels. Only a quarter of this was produced in 1908. Two companies left in 1907, and another two the following year.|$|R
25|$|When {{whales are}} spotted the <b>whale</b> <b>catchers</b> will engage in pursuit. A harpoon cannon with a grenade tipped harpoon is {{fired at the}} target whale. A rope is trailed from the harpoon {{in order to prevent}} the whale from being lost. If the whale is struck and not killed {{instantly}} by the explosive tipped harpoon, a second harpoon may be used or the whale may be shot with a rifle until dead. A past method of using a second harpoon to electrocute whales is now forbidden by the IWC. Environmental groups have reported whales being dragged backward and drowned.|$|R
