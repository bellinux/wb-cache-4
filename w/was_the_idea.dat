5|$|Gary {{states that}} one of the reasons she was {{attracted}} to the film <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of an on-screen romance with Oscar winner Michael Caine. Caine had previously starred in another Peter Benchley-adapted flop, The Island.|$|E
5|$|According to Sorkin, {{the episode}} benefited greatly from input by two former White House employees. The scene where Donna stays {{up all night}} sorting through {{documents}} in cartons <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of Eli Attie, Al Gore's chief speechwriter. Meanwhile Gene Sperling, Bill Clinton's chief economic adviser, {{came up with the}} sub-plot involving the estate tax. Sorkin, however, had certain misgivings about the estate tax story's appeal, considering the prevalent bipartisan spirit of the time, {{in the aftermath of the}} 9/11 attacks.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, {{the first}} book on tornadoes was written by John Park Finley, {{a pioneer in the}} field of tornado research. While it was a revolutionary book {{containing}} many breakthrough ideas, it contained a few ideas which have since been proven false. One of these <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that the northeast or east part of a structure was the least safe, and should be avoided when seeking shelter from a tornado.|$|E
60|$|It {{has been}} seen that a memory is a complex idea made up {{of at least two}} constituents. In the first place there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of an object; and secondly, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of <b>the</b> {{relation}} of antecedence between that object and some present objects.|$|R

5|$|Saltationism <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> {{that new}} species arise {{as a result}} of large mutations. It was seen as a much faster {{alternative}} to the Darwinian concept of a gradual process of small random variations being acted on by natural selection, and was popular with early geneticists such as Hugo de Vries, William Bateson, and early in his career, Thomas Hunt Morgan. It became the basis of the mutation theory of evolution.|$|E
5|$|The album <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of Colonel Tom Parker, Presley's manager. Parker {{wished to}} release an Elvis Presley album through Boxcar Records—a company that he formed to manage Presley's {{commercial}} rights, {{so that he}} could profit directly from it. However, since Presley was signed to RCA Records, any recordings made would legally belong to RCA. To circumvent this restriction, Parker compiled audio of Presley talking—material over which RCA could not claim rights.|$|E
5|$|The {{continued}} imprisonment of French soldiers was a {{major theme}} in the Vichy propaganda. Prisoners of war featured in the programme of moral rejuvenation promised {{as part of the}} Révolution nationale (National Revolution). A recurring idea <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of prisoners of war as martyrs or penitents, suffering in order to redeem France from its pre-war excesses. The period of detainment was therefore depicted as a form of purification which would overcome internal divides within France and atone for the defeat of 1940.|$|E

5|$|A major concept used in {{the series}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of a running clock. This {{initially}} came from Joel Surnow, who wanted the audience to always {{know what time it}} was in the show's fictional timeline. This was done by an on-screen digital clock that appears before and after commercial breaks, and a smaller clock also appears at other points in the narrative. The time shown is the in-universe time of the story. When the running clock is shown full screen, an alternating pulsating beeping noise (like the kind seen on a time bomb) for each second can usually be heard. On rare occasions, a silent clock is used. This usually follows the death of a major character or an otherwise dramatic event.|$|E
5|$|EastEnders: E20 {{originally}} aired {{as part of}} {{the main}} show's 25th anniversary celebrations. It was devised in a bid to develop and nurture new talent, including writers, actors, composers and remixers, and target a younger audience, as well as to attempt to drive more people onto the Internet. The series <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of executive producers Diederick Santer, who wanted a show where regular EastEnders characters would be in the background, and John Yorke, who wanted to improve the portrayal of teenagers in EastEnders and to get younger people writing for it.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's {{collaboration}} with Martorell was a determining factor in Gaudí's recommendation for the Sagrada Família. The church <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of Josep Maria Bocabella, {{founder of the}} Devotees of Saint Joseph Association, which acquired a complete block of Barcelona's Eixample district. The project was originally entrusted to Francisco de Paula del Villar y Lozano, who planned {{the construction of a}} neo-Gothic church, on which work began in 1882. However, the following year Villar resigned due to disagreements with the construction board, and the task went to Gaudí, who completely redesigned the project, apart from the part of the crypt that had already been built. Gaudí devoted {{the rest of his life}} to the construction of the church, which was to be the synthesis of all of his architectural discoveries.|$|E
50|$|Structure {{and agency}} are opposites.

5|$|Pontecorvo's {{solution}} to the solar neutrino problem involved an idea that he had first considered in 1957, and developed over the following decade. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that neutrinos may convert into other types of neutrinos, a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation. Somewhere between the Sun and the Earth, electron neutrinos might transform into muon neutrinos. An important point was that for this to happen, neutrinos could not have zero mass, and therefore could not travel {{at the speed of}} light. The existence of the oscillations was finally established by the Super-Kamiokande experiment in 1998 and later confirmed by other experiments.|$|E
5|$|Shades of Deep Purple is {{the debut}} studio album by the English rock band Deep Purple, {{released}} in July 1968 on Tetragrammaton in the United States and in September 1968 on Parlophone in the United Kingdom. The band, initially called Roundabout, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of former Searchers drummer Chris Curtis, who recruited Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore {{before leaving the}} project. The Mk. I line-up of the band was completed by vocalist/frontman Rod Evans, along with bassist Nick Simper and drummer Ian Paice, in March 1968.|$|E
5|$|Silver City Airways {{moved to}} Lympne in 1948, {{operating}} Bristol Freighter Mk.21 aircraft and an aerial car ferry to Le Touquet started on 13 July 1948. The air ferry <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of Griffith J Powell, {{who wanted to}} holiday in France but {{did not like the}} ferry. Bristol lent an aircraft for an experiment on 7 July 1948. The first car was Powell's Armstrong Siddeley 16 which was carried by G-AGVC.The Bristol Freighter Mk.21 could carry two cars. Although only 170 cars were carried in 1948, experience was gained.|$|E

5|$|The {{blue and}} red colours of the shirt were first worn in a match against Hispania in 1900. Several {{competing}} theories have been put forth for the {{blue and red}} design of the Barcelona shirt. The son of the first president, Arthur Witty, claimed it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> of his father as the colours {{were the same as}} the Merchant Taylor's School team. Another explanation, according to author Toni Strubell, is that the colours are from Robespierre's First Republic. In Catalonia the common perception is that the colours were chosen by Joan Gamper and are those of his home team, FC Basel. The club's most frequently used change colours have been yellow and orange. An away kit featuring the red and yellow stripes of the flag of Catalonia has also been used many times.|$|E
5|$|Theistic {{evolution}} <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that God {{intervened in}} the process of evolution, to guide {{it in such a way}} that the living world could still be considered to be designed. The term was promoted by Charles Darwin's greatest American advocate Asa Gray. However, this idea gradually fell out of favor among scientists, as they became more and more committed to the idea of methodological naturalism and came to believe that direct appeals to supernatural involvement were scientifically unproductive. By 1900, theistic evolution had largely disappeared from professional scientific discussions, although it retained a strong popular following.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the early}} 1970s plans {{continued}} to emerge for the redevelopment of the Albert Dock {{site and the}} whole of the south docks system in general. Many of these plans were quite extreme including Liverpool City Council's suggestion to use the dock basin as a landfill site. The Mersey Docks and Harbour Company (MDHC), the reincarnation of the now defunct Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, however felt it could get more money by filling in the dock basin with sand and selling it as developable land and not derelict land. One plan for the Albert Dock that was taken more seriously <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> that it become the new home of Liverpool Polytechnic (now John Moores University). The government was even willing to provide £3m in funding but like so many other plans this too fell by the wayside.|$|E

5|$|Like his heroes Swedenborg and Saint-Martin, Balzac {{attempts}} in Louis Lambert {{to construct a}} viable theory to unify spirit and matter. Young Lambert attempts this goal in his Traité de la Volonté, which – having been confiscated by a teacher – is described by the narrator:The word Will he used to connote... the mass of power by which man can reproduce, outside himself, the actions constituting his external life.... The word Mind, or Thought, which he regarded as the quintessential product of the Will, also represented the medium in which the ideas originate to which thought gives substance.... Thus the Will and the Mind were the two generating forces; the Volition and the Idea were the two products. Volition, he thought, <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>Idea</b> evolved from the abstract state to a concrete state, from its generative fluid to a solid expression.... According to him, the Mind and Ideas are the motion and the outcome of our inner organization, just as the Will and Volition are of our external activity. He gave the Will precedence over the Mind.The exploration of human will and thought is linked to Balzac's interest in Franz Mesmer, who postulated the theory of animal magnetism, a force flowing among humans. The narrator invokes Mesmer twice in the text, and describes {{a section of the}} Traité de la Volonté which reflects the animal-magnetic theory.|$|E
