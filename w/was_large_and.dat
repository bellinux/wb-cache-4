5|$|The {{main bar}} <b>was</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> black, {{with black and}} white zebra-patterned {{wallpaper}} {{on the walls of}} the room. An indoor waterfall surrounded by imitation exotic vegetation stood in the back. The club's main showroom, the Vermilion Room, often featured the likes of Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr., and the slapstick comedy duo of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis.|$|E
5|$|The {{refinery}} <b>was</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> old, featuring outdated construction methods, {{and these}} factors {{are believed to have}} contributed to the fire's severity. The origin of the explosion has been narrowed down {{to the center of the}} factory. It was believed to have occurred in a basement beneath storage silos. Investigations conducted by the Department of Justice ruled out deliberate criminal activity in 2013.|$|E
5|$|Walpole's output <b>was</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> varied. Between 1909 and 1941 {{he wrote}} thirty-six novels, five volumes of short stories, two {{original}} plays and three volumes of memoirs. His range included disturbing {{studies of the}} macabre, children's stories and historical fiction, most notably his Herries Chronicle series, set in the Lake District. He worked in Hollywood writing scenarios for two Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films in the 1930s, and played a cameo in the 1935 version of David Copperfield.|$|E
50|$|Immature {{chorionic}} villi <b>are</b> <b>larger</b> <b>and</b> {{have more}} central blood vessels; thus, the diffusion distance for gas <b>and</b> nutrient exchange <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>and,</b> therefore, placental function is impaired.|$|R
5000|$|Hoover factory (1946 <b>and</b> later) <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> {{modern and}} now being emptied.|$|R
5|$|Goldman grouped four {{subspecies}} of couesi {{from the}} interior plateaus of central Mexico together—albiventer, crinitus, aztecus, and regillus. Three of those (albiventer from Jalisco, crinitus from the Distrito Federal, and aztecus from Morelos) were described by Merriam in 1901, and Goldman had himself described regillus from Michoacán in 1915. According to Goldman, aztecus is pale <b>and</b> large-toothed, crinitus <b>is</b> <b>large,</b> dark <b>and</b> large-toothed, regillus <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> dark, <b>and</b> albiventer <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> relatively pale.|$|R
5|$|Another {{opponent}} to {{the project}} was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who wanted to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections {{to ensure that the}} municipal councils had backing in the public. Gisle Tjong was another opponent, who stated that the risk in the project <b>was</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: they could just as well last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advanced tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the accumulated funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there was overwhelming support. However, in southern Bømlo there were concerns that they would lose their ferry, as they would have a much longer rout to Haugesund via the Triangle Link. Some also stated that it was necessary to keep a ferry for people with fear of tunnels.|$|E
5|$|From 1988, environmentalists started {{actively}} {{opposing the}} Triangle Link. The most active were the {{local chapter of}} the Norwegian Society for the Conservation of Nature and Nature and Youth, who stated that the road would have serious consequences for the local boat traffic to the recreational islands of Føyno and Nautøy. Instead, they recommended that the municipalities chose a pontoon bridge. Another opponent to the project was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who argued to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections, to ensure that the municipal councils had backing in the public. Gisle Tjong stated that the risk in the project <b>was</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: they could just as well be 60 as 15 years. He instead wanted to collect tolls in advance.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Henri Théodore Pigozzi {{was looking to}} expand the {{manufacturing}} operations of his Simca company, which was enjoying much success at the time, thanks to the popular Aronde. At the same time, Ford was seeking to divest itself of its French subsidiary, Ford SAF, which had a factory in Poissy, close to Paris, {{where it had been}} manufacturing a large car called the Ford Vedette. The Poissy plant <b>was</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> there was capacity for further expansion. The Vedette was a larger car than anything that Simca had on offer at that time. These points attracted Pigozzi, who decided to take over the entire factory, along with the rights to the cars manufactured there.|$|E
50|$|The head is bifurcated, with slender tentacles {{and eyes}} in small bulges lateral {{to the base}} of tentacles. The siphon <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> {{protrudes}} over the head. The foot <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> flat, and when it is extended is slightly longer than the shell.|$|R

5|$|The Indiamen {{were not}} unprotected: each one <b>was</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> powerfully built {{and carried a}} number of cannon. Streatham and Europe weighed over 800 tons each and carried 30 cannon, whereas the smaller Lord Keith was 600 tons and carried 12 guns. Four years earlier, a convoy of East Indiamen had driven off a French ship {{of the line and}} {{attached}} frigates under Admiral Linois in similar waters by forming a battle line and firing on their opponents as they closed. The crews of these East Indiamen were not of Royal Navy standard, however, with insufficient training and large numbers of Chinese and lascar seamen, who proved unreliable in combat.|$|E
5|$|The ilium of {{the pelvis}} had a convex upper border, a low postacetabular blade (behind the acetabulum), and a narrow brevis-shelf (a {{projection}} where tail muscles attached). The pubic foot was pronounced and shorter {{at the front}} than behind. The ischium was straight and expanded hindwards, ending in a lobe-shape. The femur was sigmoid-shaped, and had a very robust, upwards pointing head, with a deep sulcus (groove). The lesser trochanter of the femoral head was wing-like, and placed below the greater trochanter, which was short. The fourth trochanter <b>was</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> projected backwards. The tibia of the lower leg was expanded at the upper end, its articular facet (where it articulated with the femur) was wide, and its shaft was compressed from front to back.|$|E
5|$|The {{main bar}} <b>was</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> black with curves in many directions. The room had {{black and white}} zebra-patterned wallpaper, {{in the style of}} New York's El Morocco club, and an indoor {{waterfall}} surrounded by imitation exotic vegetation stood in the back. Beyond the main bar was a smaller bar and a small showroom, and after that the club's main showroom, the Vermilion Room, with its burgundy velvet wallpaper. The small front room was used for year-round lounge acts and the main showroom with supper service featured top-billed acts in the summer months and for special bookings.|$|E
50|$|Zedoary {{grows in}} {{tropical}} and subtropical wet forest regions. The fragrant plant bears yellow flowers {{with red and}} green bracts and the underground stem section, a rhizome, <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> tuberous with numerous branches. The leaf shoots of the zedoary <b>are</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> can reach 1 meter (3 feet) in height.|$|R

5|$|Yet Manuel's army of 35,000 men <b>was</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> {{unwieldy}} – {{according to}} a letter that Manuel sent to King Henry II of England, the advancing column was ten miles (16km) long. Manuel marched against Iconium via Laodicea, Chonae, Lampe, Celaenae, Choma, and Antioch. Just outside {{the entrance to the}} pass at Myriokephalon, Manuel was met by Turkish ambassadors, who offered peace on generous terms. Most of Manuel's generals and experienced courtiers urged him to accept the offer. The younger and more aggressive members of the court urged Manuel to attack, however, and he took their advice and continued his advance.|$|E

25|$|Fick's lens <b>was</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> unwieldy, {{and could}} only be worn {{for a couple of}} hours at a time. August Müller in Kiel, Germany, {{corrected}} his own severe myopia with a more convenient blown-glass scleral contact lens of his own manufacture in 1888.|$|E
50|$|Prior to 1956, the {{district}} <b>was</b> <b>larger</b> <b>and</b> elected two MHAs.|$|R

50|$|The head <b>is</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> robust with a {{complete}} head shield that does not approach the ears. The tomial sheath <b>is</b> <b>large,</b> <b>and</b> inside an alveolar ridge is distinct and well formed. The head is typically dark brown to grey above and, in females, is usually blotched with cream to white in the throat region.|$|R
25|$|It {{is known}} {{that there was a}} {{building}} on this site in 1712 but it can be assumed that it may have already been there some time as Sir Francys Burdett built the nearby Saint Saviour's Church in 1662 and the hall <b>was</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> convenient with a hearth tax of 24 hearths.|$|E
25|$|The {{nasal passage}} <b>was</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> placed {{close to the}} beak. The {{nostrils}} were in a high position. On {{each side of the}} top of the skull there was a low bump between the nasal opening and the eye socket; the significance of both protuberances is unknown, but they may have been used for socialisation or mating displays. A secondary palpebral bone was lacking.|$|E
25|$|Although the M5 easily {{outperformed}} older anti-tank {{guns in the}} US service, it <b>was</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> heavy - {{making it}} hard to manhandle into position - and its anti-armor characteristics were found to be somewhat disappointing. An APDS round was never developed for the M5; an APCR round existed (see ammunition table below), {{but it is not clear}} if it was ever issued to towed TD battalions.|$|E
50|$|The major {{problems}} with standard fluorescent lamps for street lighting {{is that they}} <b>are</b> <b>large,</b> <b>and</b> produce a diffused non-directional light. They are also rather fragile. Therefore, the fixtures needed to <b>be</b> <b>large,</b> <b>and</b> could not <b>be</b> mounted more than 20-30 feet above the pavement {{if they were to}} produce an acceptable light level.|$|R
50|$|The Malagasy harrier <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>and</b> paler {{with longer}} wings and legs.|$|R
50|$|Iris delavayi <b>is</b> <b>larger</b> <b>and</b> more {{vigorous}} in growth than Iris sibirica.|$|R
25|$|In 1863, Höckert was {{commissioned}} by the count of Trolleholm Castle to paint a large painting (Slottsbranden i Stockholm den 7 maj 1697) depicting the fire that destroyed the castle Tre Kronor in 1697. The painting <b>was</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> time consuming, and Höckert made a break from it while making a trip to Hälsingland in 1865. During this trip, he made several sketches for paintings that he was planning on doing.|$|E
25|$|In {{most other}} aspects the design was {{relatively}} {{similar to other}} cargo aircraft of the era. The fuselage <b>was</b> <b>large</b> <b>and</b> {{roughly the size of}} a wide-body airliner (although relative to the length, it appeared to be a narrow-body design), with a T-tail at the end. The dozen engines were distributed evenly along the wings, with each side having four engines on the outer sections, and two between the cargo pods and fuselage.|$|E
25|$|Another {{financial}} crisis {{for the firm}} occurred in 1970, when the Penn Central Transportation Company went bankrupt with over $80 million in commercial paper outstanding, most of it issued through Goldman Sachs. The bankruptcy <b>was</b> <b>large,</b> <b>and</b> the resulting lawsuits, notably by the SEC, threatened the partnership capital, life and reputation of the firm. It was this bankruptcy that resulted in credit ratings being created for every issuer of commercial paper today by several credit rating services.|$|E
