5|$|Measure 1–30: the {{orchestra}} presents itself with <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> ritornello, but {{is in fact}} rather a concerto tutti. The movement has {{the form of an}} Italian aria, modelled after the concerto style Bach had developed in Köthen: in that style the material is presented in an instrumental tutti.|$|E
5|$|Agent Fox Mulder {{arrives at}} the civic center after <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> massacre; bodies lie on the {{sidewalk}} and in the foyer. Sheriff Spencer (John Cygan) explains that the suspect murdered four people from the elevator with his bare hands. His rampage ended when he was shot by a security guard. Spencer notes that seven other individuals have murdered twenty-two people in Franklin in the past six months. Mulder discovers that the LED display in the elevator has been damaged, and that the dead suspect has a green residue on his fingertips.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} an empty room with a fish painting, and then shows Madonna holding to <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> baby, but is {{actually}} a big bag of water. Alternating scenes shows her in a red and black kimono dancing to the song. Then, a scene features {{a group of people}} of Asian heritage, who walk down a dark hallway. As Madonna sings the song in a black kimono, she grips onto the bag of water. When the chorus starts, it features Madonna in a red kimono continuing to dance. This scene carries on {{through the rest of the}} song. There are multiple scenes of Japanese people performing butoh dance moves coached by Swedish choreographer Su-En. These scenes were shot in a decommissioned R1 Reactor below the Royal Institute of Technology in central Stockholm. The ending scene has Madonna sitting while someone is painting her back and slowly rests her body on the group. As the song fades, Madonna is in her red kimono walking and laughing towards the camera and then the screen rapidly fades to black.|$|E

25|$|Politically, {{there is}} {{evidence}} of several Sassanid and Chinese efforts in forging alliances against the common enemy, the Hephthalites. Upon the rise of the nomadic Göktürks in Inner Asia, there is also <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> collaboration between China and Sassanid to defuse Turkic advances. Documents from Mt. Mogh talk about the presence of a Chinese general {{in the service of the}} king of Sogdiana at the time of the Arab invasions.|$|E
25|$|Kurzweil says {{evolutionary}} progress looks smooth, {{but that}} really it {{is divided into}} paradigms, specific methods of solving problems. Each paradigm starts with slow growth, builds to rapid growth, and then levels off. As one paradigm levels off, pressure builds to find or develop a new paradigm. So <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> single smooth curve is really series of smaller S curves. For example Kurzweil notes that when vacuum tubes stopped getting faster, cheaper transistors became popular and continued the overall exponential growth.|$|E

After seeing a demonstration in the museum of similar crystals being used in <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> resurrection ceremony, Low tries one on Brink, bringing him back to life. They then search for a means to return to Earth, using Brink's and Robbins' talents for xenoarchaeology to decipher strange alien text and images.|$|E
25|$|Irish tales {{depict the}} Dagda {{as a figure}} of power, armed with a club. In Dorset there is a famous outline of an ithyphallic giant known as the Cerne Abbas Giant with a club cut into the chalky soil. While this was {{probably}} produced in relatively modern times (English Civil War era), it was long {{thought to be a}} representation of the Dagda. This has been called into question by recent studies which show {{that there may have been}} a representation of <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> large drapery hanging from the horizontal arm of the figure, leading to suspicion that this figure actually represents Hercules (Heracles), with the skin of the Nemean lion over his arm and carrying the club he used to kill it. In Gaul, it is speculated that the Dagda is associated with Sucellus, the striker, equipped with a hammer and cup.|$|E
25|$|User-generated {{content is}} a major feature of Spore; there are {{eighteen}} different editors (some unique to a phase). All have the same general UI and controls for positioning, scaling and coloring parts, whether {{for the creation of}} a creature, or for a building or vehicle. The Creature editor, for example, allows the player to take <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> lump of clay with a spine and mold it into a creature. Once the torso is shaped, the player can add parts such as legs, arms, feet, hands, noses, eyes, and mouths. Many of these parts affect the creature's abilities (speed, strength, diet, etc.), while some parts are purely decorative. Once the creature is formed, it can be painted using a large number of textures, overlays, colors, and patterns, which are procedurally applied depending on the topology of the creature. The only required feature is the mouth. All other parts are optional; for example, creatures without legs will slither on the ground like a slug or an inchworm, and creatures without arms will be unable to pick up objects.|$|E

[...] Here there is a glimpse of <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> small village, not marked on any map, but which is actually the set for the TV series Emmerdale. Walkers may also see red kites which have been successfully reintroduced in this area.|$|E
500|$|Quincy Jones was {{the musical}} {{supervisor}} and music producer for the film. He later {{wrote that he}} initially {{did not want to}} work on the film, but did it as a favor to Sidney Lumet. The film production marked Jones' first time working with Michael Jackson, and Jones would later produce three hit albums for Jackson: Off the Wall, Thriller, and Bad. Jones recalled working with Jackson as one of his favorite experiences from The Wiz, and spoke of Jackson's dedication to his role, comparing his acting style to Sammy Davis, Jr. Jones had a brief cameo during the [...] "Gold" [...] segment of the Emerald City sequence, playing <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fifty-foot grand piano.|$|E

Probably it was kept relatively unadorned so as not to distract from the [...] necklace. Her costume is mostly black or brown, with a wide but high neckline and white fur lined hems on the sleeves. Portinari has dark eyes, a strong nose, full lips and a pointed chin. Her visible hand, folded in prayer but unrealistically off center, wears <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> jeweled ring. The dark sleeves of her dress contain red or rouge velvet-like cloth tightened by a white belt. Her hair is shaved back to achieve the high forehead and sculptural look fashionable at the time.|$|E
500|$|Stream {{gradients}} increased on flanking {{mountain ranges}} {{as they were}} uplifted. These swifter moving streams are dry {{most of the year}} but have nevertheless cut true river valleys, canyons, and gorges that face Death and Panamint valleys. [...] In this arid environment, alluvial fans form at the mouth of these streams. Very large alluvial fans merged to form continuous alluvial slopes called bajadas along the Panamint Range. The faster uplift along the Black Mountains formed much smaller alluvial fans because older fans are buried under playa sediments before they can grow too large. Slot canyons are often found at the mouths of the streams that feed the fans, and the slot canyons in turn are topped by V-shaped gorges. This forms <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> wineglass shape to some people, thus giving them their names, [...] "wineglass canyons".|$|E
500|$|Fredric Jameson's {{analysis}} {{highlights the}} polysemy of the shark and the multiple {{ways in which}} it can be and has been read—from representing alien menaces such as communism or the Third World to more intimate dreads concerning the unreality of contemporary American life and the vain efforts to sanitize and suppress the knowledge of death. He asserts that its symbolic function {{is to be found in}} this very [...] "polysemousness which is profoundly ideological, insofar as it allows essentially social and historical anxieties to be folded back into apparently 'natural' ones... to be recontained in <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> conflict with other forms of biological existence." [...] He views Quint's demise as the symbolic overthrow of an old, populist, New Deal America and Brody and Hooper's partnership as an [...] "allegory of an alliance between the forces of law-and-order and the new technocracy of the multinational corporations... in which the viewer rejoices without understanding that he or she is excluded from it." ...|$|E

500|$|Affleck {{soon began}} work on his next directorial project, Argo (2012), for Warner Bros. Written by Chris Terrio and {{starring}} Affleck as a CIA operative, the film {{tells the story of}} the CIA plan to save six U.S. diplomats during the 1979 Iran hostage crisis by faking a production for a large-scale science fiction film. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker said the film offered [...] "further proof that we were wrong about Ben Affleck". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone remarked: [...] "Affleck takes the next step in <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> major directing career ... He directs the hell out of it, nailing the quickening pace, the wayward humor, the nerve-frying suspense." [...] A major critical and commercial success, Argo won the Academy Award, Golden Globe Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Picture. The cast won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Cast. Affleck himself won the Golden Globe Award, Directors Guild of America Award, and BAFTA Award for Best Director, becoming the first director to win these awards without a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{final moments}} linger on Dean [...] "meat-hooked {{in the center}} of <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{thousand}} mile spiderweb of rusty chains", a scene Kripke described as [...] "M. C. Escher meets Hellraiser". The original vision for the final scene would have placed Dean in a [...] "really nasty, bloody slaughterhouse, hanging from meat hooks". Here, Dean would start screaming as shadows fall over him. Discussions between Kripke, Manners, and Hayden led to the decision to present [...] "one epic glimpse" [...] of Hell, though they avoided aspects such as fire and brimstone to focus on more affordable visuals. Much debate went into the appearance of Hell because of its many variations. Though the scene matched with the many versions of [...] "chains and people being ripped apart", art director John Marcynuk felt they should have made it [...] "a little more mysterious and dark". He commented, [...] "My opinion is, the vaguer the better, because you let the imagination take over. People have different fears, and Hell's such a personal torment." [...] In series writer Sera Gamble's opinion, Dean's location is more of the [...] "waiting room"—the place [...] "they stick you before they hand you the sign-in sheet"—a far cry from what he will experience [...] "once he gets into the first chamber of Hell".|$|E
500|$|The {{staff members}} of Idolator showed high favoritism for the {{acclaimed}} the campaign, further stating {{the fact that}} [...] "when Beyonce tells people to dance, they tend to listen" [...] and so they considered that it was [...] "a pretty genius move" [...] on Michelle Obama’s part to get Beyoncé in on her 'Let's Move!' campaign to fight childhood obesity. On April 9, 2011, an instructional video featuring a group of teenagers dancing to [...] "Move Your Body" [...] was released online. After a few days, Beyoncé has said that she [...] "would record her {{own version of the}} exercise routine" [...] to show kids how it is done by shooting a new music video featuring a series of fun workouts to accompany the track. On April 26, 2011, Beyoncé released a video directed by Melina Matsoukas for [...] "Move Your Body". In the video, students join Beyoncé to perform choreography by Frank Gatson. In the choreography, Beyoncé and the students mix salsa, dancehall, The Running Man, Dougie, stomp. The music video for [...] "Move Your Body" [...] takes place as a four-minute long flash mob. The video begins during lunch hour at <b>what</b> <b>looks</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> junior high cafeteria. Everything is normal until Beyoncé, wearing short shorts and green knee-high socks, enters the cafeteria doors to begin the song. After Beyoncé's entry, all the kids jump to their feet, following along as Beyoncé leads the group through all kinds of dances.|$|E
