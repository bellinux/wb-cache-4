The veins most often found to be incompetent are the saphenous veins and the perforators communicating with the deep veins of the thigh.|$|E

They are known to exhibit a warning posture, in which they carry their tails rolled up behind them. According to native belief, they <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> warning call if they see crocodiles. In general V.salvadorii avoids human contact, but its bite is capable of causing infection, like the Komodo dragon's. One fatality was reported from a bite in 1983 when a Papuan woman was bitten and later died from an infection.|$|E

5|$|Suharto (Amoroso Katamsi), awoken {{early in}} the morning, denies Untung's announcement, stating {{explicitly}} {{that there is no}} Generals' Council and making an adjunct record notes on the true nature of G30S. As there is a power vacuum with Yani dead, Suharto takes temporary control of the Army and begins planning a counter-assault with his men; he is, however, unwilling to force a fight. He instead states that he <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> radio announcement, which is delivered after forces loyal to him retake the RRI office; it outlines the situation, describes G30S as counter-revolutionary, and states that the Army will deal with the coup. The G30S leaders flee Halim, and Suharto's troops retake the air base. Some time later, forces under Suharto's leadership attack a G30S/PKI headquarters. While PKI-affiliated soldiers fight, the Party leadership escapes and separates, planning to continue their struggle underground.|$|E
5|$|The second film, The Only Girl in Camp, {{focuses on}} Trapper Gates's daughter, {{who is the}} only woman in the mining camp. Three ruffians come across the camp and plan to rob the miners. The leader, Bill, announces himself as Professor Watson and says he <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> lecture on {{locating}} gold deposits in the town hall. All the miners are lured to the building, save the girl, and Bill's accomplices proceed to rob the men. She realizes that this meeting is unusual and goes to the town hall and witnesses the robbery, but has no way of reporting or stopping the three armed men. Struck with an idea, she returns home for her father's bear traps and sets them on the steps of town hall. The robbers back out of the town hall and step into the traps, where they are captured.|$|E
5|$|The volume, pitch, tempo {{and order}} of notes {{can be changed}} {{depending}} on the message the Australian raven intends to convey. There {{are a variety of}} contact calls: a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest. Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging. Birds in flocks make a single high-pitched caa while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify they are just passing through. An Australian raven <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> longer caa with a downward inflexion to signify its return to the nest to its mate.|$|E

5|$|Two {{prominent}} {{forms of}} display among these animals is whistling and bounding. Instead of scent-marking its territory, the reedbuck <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> shrill whistle {{to make the}} boundaries of its territory be known. As it whistles, it expels air through its nose with such a force that the whole of its body vibrates. These whistles, usually one to three in number, are followed by a few stotting bounds. This behaviour {{is also used to}} raise alarm in herds. In this, the reedbuck raises its neck, exposing the white patch on its throat, but keeping the tail down, and leaps in a way similar to the impala's jumps, landing on its forelegs. This is accompanied by the popping of the inguinal glands in the legs. Fights begin with both opponents holding their horns low, in a combat stance; followed by the locking of horns and pushing one another. These fights can even lead to deaths.|$|E
5|$|The {{tendency}} to create larger calibre cannon during the World Wars has reversed since. The United States Army, for example, sought a lighter, more versatile howitzer, to replace their ageing pieces. As {{it could be}} towed, the M198 was selected to be the successor to the World War II–era cannon used at the time, and entered service in 1979. Still in use today, the M198 is, in turn, being slowly replaced by the M777 Ultralightweight howitzer, which weighs nearly half as much and can be more easily moved. Although land-based artillery such as the M198 are powerful, long-ranged, and accurate, naval guns have not been neglected, despite being much smaller than in the past, and, in some cases, having been replaced by cruise missiles. However, the 's planned armament includes the Advanced Gun System (AGS), a pair of 155mm guns, which fire the Long Range Land-Attack Projectile. The warhead, which weighs , has a circular error of probability of , and will be mounted on a rocket, to increase the effective range to , further {{than that of the}} Paris Gun. The AGS's barrels will be water cooled, and will fire 10 rounds per minute, per gun. The combined firepower from both turrets <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> Zumwalt-class destroyer the firepower equivalent to 18 conventional M198 howitzers. The reason for the re-integration of cannon as a main armament in United States Navy ships is because satellite-guided munitions fired from a gun are less expensive than a cruise missile but have a similar guidance capability.|$|E

25|$|Monte Carlo {{arithmetic}} is {{a technique}} in Monte Carlo methods where the rounding is randomly up or down.

25|$|Consider a grid graph with r {{rows and}} c columns; the number n of {{vertices}} equals rc. For instance, in the illustration, r=5, c=8, and n=40. If r is odd, {{there is a}} single central row, and otherwise there are two rows equally close to the center; similarly, if c is odd, {{there is a single}} central column, and otherwise there are two columns equally close to the center. Choosing S to be any of these central rows or columns, and removing S from the graph, partitions the graph into two smaller connected subgraphs A and B, each of which has at most n/2 vertices. If r≤c (as in the illustration), then choosing a central column <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> separator S with r≤√n vertices, and similarly if c≤r then choosing a central row <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> separator with at most √n vertices. Thus, every grid graph has a separator S of size at most √n, the removal of which partitions it into two connected components, each of size at most n/2.|$|E

25|$|If an {{extrasolar planet}} is detected, a minimum mass {{for the planet}} can be {{determined}} from {{the changes in the}} star's radial velocity. To find a more precise measure of the mass requires knowledge of the inclination of the planet's orbit.

25|$|Intuitively {{one would}} want an h {{very close to}} zero, however when using floating-point operations, the {{smallest}} number won't give the best approximation of a derivative. As h grows smaller the difference between f (a + h) and f(a) grows smaller, cancelling out the most significant and least erroneous digits and making the most erroneous digits more important. As a result the smallest number of h possible <b>will</b> <b>give</b> <b>a</b> more erroneous approximation of a derivative than a somewhat larger number. This {{is perhaps the most}} common and serious accuracy problem.|$|E
