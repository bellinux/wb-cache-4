5|$|Narayan {{highlights}} {{the social context}} and everyday life of his characters. He {{has been compared to}} <b>William</b> <b>Faulkner</b> who also created a similar fictional town and likewise explored with humour and compassion the energy of ordinary life. Narayan's short stories have been compared with those of Guy de Maupassant because of his ability to compress a narrative. However he has also been criticised for the simplicity of his prose.|$|E
5|$|Narayan's writing {{style was}} often {{compared}} to that of <b>William</b> <b>Faulkner</b> since both their works brought out the humour and energy of ordinary life while displaying compassionate humanism. The similarities also extended to their juxtaposing of the demands of society against the confusions of individuality. Although their approach to subjects was similar, their methods were different; Faulkner was rhetorical and illustrated his points with immense prose while Narayan was very simple and realistic, capturing the elements all the same.|$|E

5|$|Twelve U.S. {{citizens}} {{have won the}} Nobel Prize in Literature, most recently Bob Dylan in 2016. <b>William</b> <b>Faulkner,</b> Ernest Hemingway and John Steinbeck are often named among the most influential writers of the 20th century. Popular literary genres such as the Western and hardboiled crime fiction developed in the United States. The Beat Generation writers opened up new literary approaches, as have postmodernist authors such as John Barth, Thomas Pynchon, and Don DeLillo.|$|E
5|$|After {{leaving the}} band Society's Finest, {{in which he}} played guitar, vocalist Tim Lambesis formed As I Lay Dying in 2000. Starting out as a duet with drummer Jordan Mancino, they first met as a band in February 2001. They both were in the {{hardcore}} punk band Point of Recognition. The band's name came from the novel {{of the same name}} by <b>William</b> <b>Faulkner</b> that was published in 1930; although the band's lyrics and music are not directly inspired by the novel.|$|E
5|$|Shakespeare {{influenced}} novelists such as Thomas Hardy, <b>William</b> <b>Faulkner,</b> and Charles Dickens. The American novelist Herman Melville's soliloquies owe much to Shakespeare; his Captain Ahab in Moby-Dick is {{a classic}} tragic hero, inspired by King Lear. Scholars have identified 20,000 pieces of music linked to Shakespeare's works. These include two operas by Giuseppe Verdi, Otello and Falstaff, whose critical standing compares {{with that of the}} source plays. Shakespeare has also inspired many painters, including the Romantics and the Pre-Raphaelites. The Swiss Romantic artist Henry Fuseli, a friend of William Blake, even translated Macbeth into German. The psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud drew on Shakespearean psychology, in particular, that of Hamlet, for his theories of human nature.|$|E

5|$|The diverse {{elements}} of the film have led it to defy efforts at genre classification, with the work being variously {{referred to as a}} film noir, a horror film, a Künstlerroman, and a buddy film. It contains various literary allusions and religious overtones, as well as references to many real-life people and events – most notably the writers Clifford Odets and <b>William</b> <b>Faulkner,</b> of whom the characters of Barton Fink and W. P. Mayhew are often seen as fictional representations. Several features of the film's narrative, particularly an image of a woman at the beach which recurs throughout, have sparked much commentary, with the Coens acknowledging some intentional symbolic elements while denying an attempt to communicate any single message in the film. Despite disagreement over certain details of the work, Barton Fink continues to be positively received, with screenwriter Charlie Kaufman among its admirers.|$|E
5|$|Several {{of the new}} medium's biggest attractions {{came from}} {{vaudeville}} and the musical theater, where performers such as Jolson, Eddie Cantor, Jeanette MacDonald, and the Marx Brothers were accustomed {{to the demands of}} both dialogue and song. James Cagney and Joan Blondell, who had teamed on Broadway, were brought west together by Warner Bros. in 1930. A few actors were major stars during both the silent and the sound eras: John Barrymore, Ronald Colman, Bebe Daniels, William Powell, Norma Shearer, the comedy team of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, and the incomparable Charlie Chaplin, whose City Lights (1931) and Modern Times (1936) employed sound almost exclusively for music and effects. Janet Gaynor became a top star with the synch-sound but dialogueless Seventh Heaven and Sunrise, as did Joan Crawford with the technologically similar Our Dancing Daughters (1928). Greta Garbo was the one non–native English speaker to retain Hollywood stardom {{on both sides of the}} great sound divide. Silent film extra Clark Gable, who had received extensive voice training during his earlier stage career, went on to dominate the new medium for decades. The new emphasis on speech also caused producers to hire many novelists, journalists, and playwrights with experience writing good dialogue. Among those who became Hollywood scriptwriters during the 1930s were Nathanael West, <b>William</b> <b>Faulkner,</b> Robert Sherwood, Aldous Huxley, and Dorothy Parker.|$|E
