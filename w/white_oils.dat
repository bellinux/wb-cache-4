40|$|Abstract: Coastlines {{and birds}} {{blackened}} by mineral oil are an icon for {{the risks involved}} in the transport of mineral oils. Regulations governing such transport have been developed {{since the end of}} the 19 th century. In the 1970 s, international environmental protection standards were introduced through Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution by Ships and it’s Amendments (MARPOL 73 / 78) for mineral (black) oil tankers. Regulation of the maritime transport of other bulk liquids, such as chemicals, in special tank ships (chemical tankers) has also been developed since that time (as Annex II to MARPOL), thus leaving the transport of vegetable oils more or less unregulated. Today, about a third of the tank ship capacity non-licensed for mineral oils is used for vegetable (<b>white)</b> <b>oils.</b> Volumes are increasing. Marine environmental protection became an issue when fl oating vegetable oils coated birds and European coastlines in the early 1990 s. As this damage to birds were caused by operational discharge and not by accident, no press pictures of oiled animals appeared in the media. Th e revision of the environmental regulations was advocated only by experts in maritime aff airs and pollution prevention. It took the maritime community several years to acknowledge that <b>white</b> <b>oils</b> produced similar hazards just as the black oils and needed stricter regulations...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} oil viscosity, base oil temperature, and {{surface-active}} agents naturally present in mineral oils on the lubricating effectiveness of MoS 2 dispersions under boundary lubrication conditions are investigated. Friction and wear data are obtained from tests conducted under {{a wide range}} of oil viscosities and operating temperatures. The dispersion temperature at which the friction dropped below that obtained with the base oils, depended upon the base oil viscosity and the concentration of surface-active agents present in the oil. <b>White</b> <b>oils</b> showed reductions in friction before mineral oils of like viscosity, and lower viscosity oils showed reductions in friction before heavier viscosity oils. The results show that for a given base oil, wear increases as temperature increases, while the wear obtained from a MoS 2 dispersion made from the base oil remains approximately constant as temperature is increased...|$|E

Since 13 th Dalai Lama Period, Tibetan painters have begun to use natural protective varnishes with imported resins, which were replaced by alkyd resin varnishes during the 1970 s according to accounts of local painters. Tung oil and rosin resin were detected in samples of the varnish, both of which can be dissolved in turpentine, but {{it is not possible to}} date the application of the varnish due to the use of the same materials by painters today.|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of hydrodemetallation {{of nickel}} etioporphyrin I (Ni-Etio), nickel tetraphenylporphine (Ni-TPP), and vanadyl etioporphyrin I (VO-Etio) {{have been studied}} in batch autoclave experiments, with <b>white</b> <b>oils</b> as solvents, and CoO-MoO 3 /Al 203 as catalyst without presulfiding. The effects of hydrogen pressure up to 12 - 500 KPa and temperature between 287 - 357 C were studied. Up to 90 % metal removal, the data can be described by fractional order kinetics. The activation energy is from 27 - 37 kcal/g mole, and the hydrogen pressure dependence is from 1. 2 - 2. 2 order. Vanadium removal tends to have larger activation energy and smaller hydrogen pressure dependence. A few runs on mixed vanadyl and nickel etioporphyrins showed that while the presence of vanadyl compounds will suppress the nickel removal reaction, the reverse is less significant. Few runs on free base etio-porphyrin and tetraphenylporphine show that free base porphyrins quickly disappear in the autoclave. Catalyst with different propotion of cobalt and molybdenum have been prepared to catalyze nickel etioporphyrin as reactants. The result. shows that order of impregnation {{has no effect on}} hydrodemetallation activity, and MoO 3 /Al 2 03 catalyst is more active than CoO/Al 2 0 3 catalyst...|$|E
30|$|Tight {{environmental}} regulations {{coupled with the}} constant need to enhance water-based drilling mud performance for use in deeper formation where it can withstand high temperature, high pressure and high saline condition have always been an existential issue during drilling operations. This research compared the performance of biodiesel produced from waste vegetable oil with that of <b>white</b> <b>oil</b> 5 #, used as additives in mud formulations. Their effectiveness was tested at high temperature high pressure, {{in the presence of}} monovalent and divalent electrolytes. The mud density, rheological behavior, yield point, fluid loss under high temperature and pressure, and cake thickness were examined. The biodiesel emulsion mud proved more stable compared to both the <b>white</b> <b>oil</b> emulsion mud and the water-based mud without oil additive under thermal and saline conditions. The biodiesel emulsion mud demonstrated low and stable mud viscosity under the different conditions studied. The fluid loss reduction was better for biodiesel emulsion mud with API fluid loss of 2.20  cm 3 and high temperature high pressure filtration loss of 9.4  cm 3, while <b>white</b> <b>oil</b> emulsion mud gave 6.40 and 18.40  cm 3, respectively, for both parameters at 180  °C in calcium-contaminated mud. The biodiesel emulsion mud exhibited superior qualities of rheological properties compared to <b>white</b> <b>oil</b> emulsion mud at higher temperature and saline conditions. The rheological models of the <b>white</b> <b>oil</b> emulsion mud and biodiesel emulsion mud at room temperature followed Bingham plastic model, but at high temperature their rheogram approximated to Herschel–Bulkley model.|$|R

40|$|Mineral {{hydrocarbons}} {{consist of}} two fractions, mineral oil saturated hydrocarbons (MOSH) and mineral oil aromatic hydrocarbons (MOAH). MOAH {{is a potential}} public health hazard because it may include carcinogenic polycyclic compounds. In the present study, 400 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was introduced, {{in the context of}} official controls, to measure MOSH and MOAH in raw materials or pure mineral hydrocarbon final products (cosmetics and medicinal products). Quantitative determination (qNMR) has been established using the ERETIC methodology (electronic reference to access in vivo concentrations) based on the PULCON principle (pulse length based concentration determination). Various mineral hydrocarbons (e. g., <b>white</b> <b>oils,</b> paraffins or petroleum jelly) were dissolved in deuterated chloroform. The ERETIC factor was established using a quantification reference sample containing ethylbenzene and tetrachloronitrobenzene. The following spectral regions were integrated: MOSH δ 3. 0 – 0. 2 ppm and MOAH δ 9. 2 - 6. 5, excluding solvent signals. Validation showed a sufficient precision of the method with a coefficient of variation < 6 % and a limit of detection < 0. 1 g/ 100 g. The applicability of the method was proven by analysing 27 authentic samples with MOSH and MOAH contents in the range of 90 - 109 g/ 100 g and 0. 02 - 1. 10 g/ 100  g, respectively. It is important to distinguish this new NMR-approach from the hyphenated liquid chromatography-gas chromatography methodology previously used to characterize MOSH/MOAH amounts in cosmetic products. For mineral hydrocarbon raw materials or pure mineral hydrocarbon-based cosmetic products, NMR delivers higher specificity without any sample preparation besides dilution. Our sample survey shows that previous methods may have overestimated the MOAH amount in mineral oil products and opens new paths to characterize this fraction. Therefore, the developed method can be applied for routine monitoring of consumer products aiming to minimize public health risks...|$|E
40|$|Absorption, steady-state, and time-resolved {{fluorescence}} measurements {{have been}} performed on laurdan dissolved either in white viscous apolar solvents or in ethanol {{as a function of}} temperature. The heterogeneity of the absorption spectra in <b>white</b> <b>oils</b> or in ethanol is consistent with semiempirical calculations performed previously on Prodan. From steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence measurements in apolar media, an excited state reaction is evidenced. The bimodal lifetime distribution determined from the maximum entropy method (MEM) analysis is attributed to the radiative deexcitation of a "locally excited" (LE) state and of a "charge transfer" (CT) state, whereas a very short component (20 ps), the sign and the amplitude of which depend on the emission wavelength, is attributed to the kinetics of the interconvertion reaction. The observation of an isoemissive point in the temperature range from - 50 degrees C to - 110 degrees C in ethanol suggests an interconvertion between two average excited-state populations: unrelaxed and solvent-relaxed CT states. A further decrease in temperature (- 190 degrees C), leading to frozen ethanol, induces an additional and important blue shift. This low temperature spectrum is partly attributed to the radiative deexcitation of the LE state. Time-resolved emission spectra (TRES) measurements at - 80 degrees C in the ethanol liquid phase show a large spectral shift of approximately 2500 cm(- 1) (stabilization energy of the excited state: 7. 1 kcal x M(- 1)). The time-dependent fluorescence shift (TDFS) is described for its major part by a nanosecond time constant. The initial part of the spectral shift reveals, however, a subnanosecond process that can be due to fast internal solvent reorientation and/or to intramolecular excited-state reactions. These two relaxation times are also detected in the analysis of the fluorescence decays in the middle range of emission energy. The activation energy of the longest process is approximately 3 kcal x M(- 1). At - 190 degrees C, one subnanosecond and one nanosecond excited-state reactions are also evidenced. They are likely due to intramolecular rearrangements after the excitation, leading to the CT state and not to solvent relaxation, which is severely hindered in these temperature conditions. Therefore, both intramolecular and solvent relaxations are responsible for the large Stokes shift displayed by this probe as a function of solvent polarity. A possible scheme is proposed for the deexcitation pathway, taking into account the kinetics observed in these different solvents...|$|E
40|$|Since its {{establishment}} in 1908, the Onderstepoort Veterinary complex has developed more than 50 veterinary vaccines {{that have been}} used over the period in the control of animal viral and bacterial diseases in Southern Africa and elsewhere around the world. These vaccines have been either live attenuated or inactivated. The inactivated vaccines are generally formulated with an aqueous or an oil adjuvant. Onderstepoort oil-adjuvanted vaccines have been formulated with the old Freund’s formulation, using surfactants that are not always compliant with current regulatory requirements. Other disadvantages associated with use of the traditional Freund’s formulation include safety in vaccinated animals, unavailability of certain reagents or components, as well as their impact to the cost of the final vaccine. The present study was designed to assess four oil-adjuvanted Onderstepoort vaccines, i. e. the E. coli, the enterotoxaemia or Pulpy kidney, the Vibrio or Campylobacter fetus and the Infectious coryza vaccines. The first three vaccines are formulated with a surfactant that is no longer readily available and is not registered by regulatory authorities, while the surfactant used in the Infectious coryza vaccine tends to result in adverse reactions in vaccinated chickens. The traditional liquid paraffin Marcol was compared to two new liquid paraffin <b>white</b> <b>oils</b> (PFP 8 and PFP 14), while the traditional emulsifiers Cirrasol EN-MP® and Arlacel® were compared to two new products, Montanide 103 ™ and Simulsol-P 2 ®. In addition, Cirrasol EN-MP® was compared to Arlacel®, {{given the fact that the}} latter is an approved emulsifier for use in animal vaccines. Two ready-to-use emulsifiers, i. e. Montanide™ ISA 70 VG and Montanide™ ISA 206, were also tested with the Infectious coryza vaccine. The three liquid paraffins and four surfactants were evaluated for their physical characteristics, as well as their ability to generate a safe and effective vaccine when formulated with the above four vaccine antigens. The safety and efficacy of the different formulations were evaluated in both laboratory animals and target animals, i. e. sheep, cattle and chicken. The results obtained can be summarized as follows. (i) The two new liquid paraffins had similar physical characteristics as the traditional Marcol, and they also did not cause adverse reactions in vaccinated animals; (ii) Simulsol-P 2 ® displayed a poor ability to form a stable emulsion for the above vaccines; (iii) Montanide 103 ™ was stable and was safe in most of the vaccines, but caused persistent local reactions in the E. coli vaccine; and (iv) the Arlacel® formulations were stable, safe and showed better immunogenicity profiles as compared to the other formulations.
