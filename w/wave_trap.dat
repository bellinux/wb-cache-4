40|$|We {{investigate}} the temporal evolution of impulsively generated perturbations in a potential coronal arcade with an embedded loop.

The linearized time-dependent magnetohydrodynamic equations have been numerically solved in field-aligned coordinates and the time evolution of the initial perturbations has been studied in the zero-beta approximation. For propagation constrained to {{the plane of the}} arcade, the considered initial perturbations do not excite trapped modes of the system. This weakness of the model is overcome by the inclusion of wave propagation in the ignorable direction. The inclusion of perpendicular propagation produces two main results.

Second, the consideration of an inhomogeneous corona enables the resonant damping of vertical oscillations and the energy transfer from the interior of the loop to the external coronal medium...|$|E

The chondrogenic transcription factor Sox 9 could be detected in cells in the ultrasound trap within 3 h (ultrasound exposure alone was not responsible for this effect).

40|$|International audienceFlexural {{vibrations}} {{are highly}} responsible for noise radiation by thin structures. In the transport industry, the damping of such vibrations is often achieved using thick viscoelastic layers, {{which leads to}} an undesirable increase of mass. In this regard, the acoustic black hole effect has received recent attention as an efficient and lightweight method for damping flexural vibrations. An acoustic black hole consists of a thin structure presenting a smooth decrease in its wave velocity along a given direction, thus acting as a <b>wave</b> <b>trap</b> where the vibrations can be efficiently damped.

The device is characterized by the X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), optical spectroscopy, microwave power spectroscopy and light power dependent photoconductivity. While the X-ray diffraction technique revealed a polycrystalline ZnS coated with two amorphous layers of Ge and GaSe, the hot probe tests revealed the formation of pn interface. The optical spectra which were employed to reveal the conduction and valence band offsets at the ZnS/Ge and Ge/GaSe interface indicated information about the dielectric dispersion at the interface. The dielectric spectra of the ZnS/Ge/GaSe heterojunction which was modeled assuming the domination of surface plasmon interactions through the films revealed a pronounced increase in the drift mobility of free carriers in the three layers compared to the single and double layers.

The outcome of initial cell–cell contact, i. e. whether the cells stuck {{at the point of}} contact (collision efficiency= 1) or rolled around each other (collision efficiency= 0), was monitored in situ by video-microscopy.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new kind}} of touch sensor that utilizes the concept of wireless energy transfer (WET). A near-field sheet like a waveguide-based WET system was used for this purpose based on its geometric suitability. The approaching target object (human finger bio-impedance) disturbs the overall sheet reactance based on a complex power conservation equation at the resonant frequency. Thus, the drop in the efficiency of the power transfer can be utilized to carry out the task of sensing. The WET sensor was designed to operate at 29 MHZ, with a power transfer efficiency of - 3. 18 dB. An experimental demonstration was performed by feeding a 10 V peak-to-peak sine wave at the transmitter end and reading a dc output using a full-wave rectifier and multi-meter at the receiver end. The system was designed to achieve a drop of 2. 1 V when a touch was registered. The sensor was also designed to operate in the proximity mode. For operation in the proximity mode, the receiver had to be a <b>wave</b> <b>trap</b> cavity. This was achieved by designing the receiver to have a cylindrical wave cavity arrangement. The WET sensor had to be unaffected by the presence of an electric field, and this was demonstrated by carrying out sensing while the sensor was located under an LCD, which has a considerable electric field. It was experimentally demonstrated that the sensor had a linear output in proximity mode. Proposed sensor could be ideal candidate for: touch screen panels, human-robotics interactions and security applications. close 1...|$|E
