5|$|The KRRC's 3rd Battalion, {{including}} {{a platoon of}} 70 Rhodesians, was transferred from France to the Salonika Front in 1915.

Most of the men had been killed in action, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>were</b> prisoners of the Bulgarians.|$|E

5|$|The Singapore {{strategy}} {{was a series}} of war plans that evolved over a twenty-year period in which the basing of a fleet at Singapore was a common but not a defining aspect.

5|$|The {{first series}} {{received}} a mixed critical reception, with some reviewers concerned {{that it is}} too derivative and predictable, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>were</b> more positive. The producers were happy to have started well, survived the ratings lull in the middle, and ended with an upward curve in the last two weeks. Audience breakdowns indicate that a higher proportion of younger viewers were tuning in to Survivors than many other shows.|$|E
5|$|After the Japanese {{surrender}} in 1945, Japanese settlers were repatriated back to Japan, {{and male}} Japanese settlers who had raised Japanese-Palauan families abandoned {{their families in}} favour of repatriation, reasoning that the offspring {{would be able to}} better adapt in Palau than in Japan. Many of these Palauan women raised their mixed-race children singlehandedly, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>were</b> abandoned and adopted by Palauan families. Some Japanese-Palauan families migrated to Japan, but generally faced a cultural shock and petitioned to return to Palau after living in Japan for some years. Most petitions were allowed, although they were not allowed to bring their Japanese spouses along.|$|E

5|$|After the attack, {{the bulk}} of the {{civilian}} population and the remaining Croatian police and troops fled over snow-covered terrain in poor weather to Karlovac, Ogulin, and to the nearby territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Approximately 30–60 civilians, largely elderly people, remained in Saborsko. The JNA and SAO Krajina troops forced those who remained behind to leave the village, killing or abusing the civilians. At least 25 civilians were murdered by the troops {{in the immediate aftermath of}} the capture of Saborsko. Some of the victims were shot, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>were</b> beaten or burned to death.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} dinosaur families, the {{systematics}} (evolutionary relationships) {{within the family}} Abelisauridae are confused. Several cladistic {{studies have indicated that}} Majungasaurus shares a close relationship with Carnotaurus from South America, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>were</b> unable to firmly place it in the phylogeny. The most recent analysis, using the most complete information, instead recovered Majungasaurus in a clade with Rajasaurus and Indosaurus from India, but excluding South American genera like Carnotaurus, Ilokelesia, Ekrixinatosaurus, Aucasaurus and Abelisaurus, as well as Rugops from mainland Africa. This leaves open the possibility of separate clades of abelisaurids in western and eastern Gondwana.|$|E
5|$|Bottling and {{shipping}} of the Malvern water grew in volume. In 1842, Dr. James Wilson and Dr. James Manby Gully, leading exponents of hydrotherapy, set up clinics in Malvern (Holyrood House {{for women and}} Tudor House for men). Malvern expanded rapidly as a residential spa. Several large hotels {{and many of the}} large villas in Malvern date from its heyday. Many smaller hotels and guest houses were built between about 1842 and 1875. By 1855 there were already 95hotels and boarding houses and by 1865 over a quarter of the town's 800houses were boarding and lodging houses. Most were in Great Malvern, the town centre, <b>while</b> <b>others</b> <b>were</b> in the surrounding settlements of Malvern Wells, Malvern Link, North Malvern and West Malvern.|$|E
