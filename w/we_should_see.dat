We are, as it were, laying gunpowder, grain by grain, under the old {{building}} of error and superstition, which a single spark may hereafter inflame, so as to produce an instantaneous explosion; in consequence of which that edifice, the erection {{of which has been}} the work of ages, may be overturned in a moment, and so effectually as that the same foundation can never be built upon again....|$|E
25|$|He was {{progressive}} and anti-progressive at once, and likewise at once both {{a critic of}} the Zeitgeist and its most interesting expression. He was, in effect, stranded on a beachhead of his own thinking between past and future. That he was not able, by himself, to fashion a bridge between them is neither surprising, nor, in the end, disappointing. <b>We</b> <b>should</b> <b>see</b> this failure, rather, as an aspect of his genius. He both was and was not a man of his time.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the pragmatic}} theories, {{such as those}} by Charles Peirce and William James, {{included}} aspects of correspondence, coherence and constructivist theories. Crispin Wright argued in his 1992 book Truth and Objectivity that any predicate which satisfied certain platitudes about truth qualified as a truth predicate. In some discourses, Wright argued, {{the role of the}} truth predicate might be played by the notion of superassertibility. Michael Lynch, in a 2009 book Truth as One and Many, argued that <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>see</b> truth as a functional property capable of being multiply manifested in distinct properties like correspondence or coherence.|$|E
60|$|Indeed it was {{a memorable}} night. Gradually the {{realization}} that they were rich sank securely home into {{the souls of the}} pair, then they began to place the money. If we could have looked out through the eyes of these dreamers, <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have <b>seen</b> their tidy little wooden house disappear, and two-story brick with a cast-iron fence in front of it take its place; <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have <b>seen</b> a three-globed gas-chandelier grow down from the parlor ceiling; <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have <b>seen</b> the homely rag carpet turn to noble Brussels, a dollar and a half a yard; <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have <b>seen</b> the plebeian fireplace vanish away and a recherche, big base-burner with isinglass windows take position and spread awe around. And <b>we</b> <b>should</b> have <b>seen</b> other things, too; among them the buggy, the lap-robe, the stove-pipe hat, and so on.|$|R

500|$|Angus Young later recalled, [...] "I {{remember}} the first time I had ever heard Brian's (Johnson) name was from Bon. Bon had mentioned that he had been in England once touring with a band and he had mentioned that Brian had been in a band called Geordie and Bon had said 'Brian Johnson, he was a great rock and roll singer in the style of Little Richard.' And that was Bon's big idol, Little Richard. I think when he saw Brian at that time, to Bon it was 'Well he's a guy that knows what rock and roll is all about.' He mentioned that to us in Australia. I suppose when we decided to continue, Brian was the first name that Malcolm and myself came up with, so we said <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>see</b> if we can find him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Taylor often loses out to Brooke, as Thorne (Ridge's brother) loses out to Ridge. When {{asked in}} 2011 {{where she would}} like her storyline to go, Tylo said: [...] "I think <b>we</b> <b>should</b> <b>see</b> Thorne and Taylor get strong and stand up to these people who mowed them down." [...] In March 2012, Tylo said that Taylor is finally {{learning}} to pursue what she wants instead of always putting others first. She said, [...] "In psychology, they tell you {{to be true to}} yourself. Maybe she is finally doing that, even though in her moral compass she knows that it is better to put other people first. She has been going after what she wants instead. It is a very good growing place for Taylor to go back to reality and realize that she is not perfect and that she needs to try not looking so perfect so much." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We've {{certainly}} had our fill of adventures," [...] came from Dick, who was {{shaking hands with}} his Uncle Randolph. [...] "And more than once <b>we</b> thought <b>we</b> <b>should</b> never <b>see</b> Valley Brook farm again." ...|$|R
