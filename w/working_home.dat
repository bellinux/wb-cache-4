40|$|This paper investigates how <b>working</b> from <b>home</b> affects employees' work effort. Employees, {{who have}} the {{possibility}} to work from home, have a high autonomy in scheduling their work and therefore are assumed {{to have a higher}} intrinsic motivation. Thus, we expect <b>working</b> from <b>home</b> to positively influence work effort of employees. For the empirical analysis we use the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). To account for self-selection into working locations we use an instrumental variable (IV) estimation strategy. Our empirical results show that <b>working</b> from <b>home</b> has a significantly positive influence on work effort. Moreover, we find that also the frequency of <b>working</b> from <b>home</b> is crucial. The more often employees work from home, the higher is the work effort they provide...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} based on <b>working</b> from <b>home</b> and {{the aim is to}} assess the impact that <b>working</b> from <b>home</b> has on {{motivation}} and performance levels of employees working within a banking organisation. Previous research around this topic has focused on how <b>working</b> from <b>home</b> is an extremely positive way of working and this has been possible due to newer technologies being readily available. The aim {{of this study was to}} look in depth at the experiences employees had whilst <b>working</b> from <b>home</b> and how each individual felt their motivation and performance levels were affected. A qualitative research approach was taken as part of this study which was carried out through the use of semi-structured interviews. This approach was taken in order to gather employees opinions and experiences to see whether any trends emerged in relation to their motivation and performance levels whilst <b>working</b> from <b>home.</b> The use of semi-structured interviews allowed the researcher to record the interviews with the use of a Dictaphone, all of the interviews were transcribed and coded in order for the researcher to analyse them using a thematic approach. Conclusions were drawn, outlining that <b>working</b> from <b>home</b> does higher motivation and performance levels of employees. Although there were mixed opinions presented as to whether employee performance levels were higher whilst <b>working</b> from <b>home</b> employees commented on how their performance levels would be affected negatively if <b>working</b> from <b>home</b> was removed. Overall it was clear to see the high levels of positivity surrounding <b>working</b> from <b>home</b> and how this impacts positively on employee motivation and performance levels, which can have positive effects on employee well-being, employee work life balance and also job satisfaction. In addition to this if employees are more motivated and performing to a higher standard then this is likely to also have a positive effect on the organisation in terms of retaining staff and achieving more from their employees...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the trade-off between <b>working</b> at <b>home</b> and out-of-home, ICT and commuting time. To this end, we develop a microeconomic demand system, which explicitly incorporates both time and income constraints. Commuting time is considered {{as the price}} to be paid for working out-of-home and a decrease in earnings as the price for <b>working</b> at <b>home.</b> For the latter, we find that <b>working</b> at <b>home</b> leads to a (marginally significant) reduction of the wage rate of about 19 %, but this gap largely disappears when ICT is used for at home work. To examine the relation between out-of-home and at home work empirically, we estimate a translog indirect utility function, from which we are able to estimate substitution and price elasticities between <b>working</b> at <b>home</b> and out-of-home for The Netherlands. The results show that changes in ICT and commuting time display rather weak substitution effects on working out-of-home and at home, respectively. Moreover, individual characteristics - especially age and education - seem to be more important for the choice between <b>working</b> at <b>home</b> and out-of-home than ICT availability or commuting time. ...|$|R

40|$|Flexible work {{arrangements}} such as allowing {{employees to}} work at home are used in firms, especially since {{information and communication technologies}} have become so widespread. Using individual-level data from 10, 884 German employees, this paper analyses the determinants of <b>working</b> at <b>home</b> as a form of flexible work arrangements. The analysis is based on descriptive analyses and a discrete choice model using a probit estimation approach. The results reveal that men have a higher probability {{to work at}} home but {{women are more likely to}} work at home intensively. Education, tenure and the use of computers increase the probability of <b>working</b> at <b>home</b> while firm size and a young age of employees reduce it. Having children less than six years old, overtime and work time have a positive impact on both <b>working</b> at <b>home</b> and on <b>working</b> at <b>home</b> intensively. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{topic of}} my {{bachelor}} thesis is ``The issues of hospice care {{from the viewpoint}} of nurses <b>working</b> for <b>home</b> care agencies and potential patients``. The following two objectives and three hypotheses were formulated for the thesis: The first goal was to map the situation in provision of home hospice care {{from the viewpoint of}} nurses <b>working</b> for <b>home</b> care agencies. Two hypotheses were formulated for this objective. H 1 - Nurses <b>working</b> for <b>home</b> care agencies provide home hospice care and H 2 - Nurses <b>working</b> for <b>home</b> care agencies are interested in expanding the home hospice care by means of mobile hospice units. The second objective of the bachelor thesis was to survey awareness of the lay public about the provision of hospice care by home care agencies. For this objective the third and the last hypothesis H 3 was formulated { [...] } The lay public has no information about the provision of hospice care by home care agencies. A quantitative research method has been used to achieve the objective, using inquiring with questionnaires. Two types of questionnaires were used, one for nurses <b>working</b> for <b>home</b> care agencies and one for the lay public. The resulting data have been processed with a descriptive statistical method. The first surveyed group consisted of 57 nurses and the second surveyed group consisted of 75 respondents. We have found out that nurses <b>working</b> for <b>home</b> care agencies provide home hospice care but they are often unable to ensure quality conditions for such home hospice care. Another surprising finding was that the nurses <b>working</b> for <b>home</b> care agencies were not interested in extending the home hospice care with mobile hospice units. We believe that the nurses <b>working</b> for <b>home</b> care agencies lack the necessary information about the home hospice care. The hypothesis No. 1 : Nurses <b>working</b> for <b>home</b> care agencies provide home hospice care has been disproved and also the hypothesis No. 2 : Nurses <b>working</b> for <b>home</b> care agencies are interested in expanding the home hospice care by means of mobile hospice units has been disproved, which means the first objective has been met. Further, we have found out that the lay public does not have sufficient information about the provision of hospice care by home care agencies, which means that the hypothesis No. 3 : The lay public has no information about the provision of hospice care by home care agencies has been confirmed and the second objective has been met. In this connection I have proposed some measures to improve the awareness of home hospice care. I have recommended informative articles to be developed for magazines intended for the lay public, as well as for professional journals for nurses. I have also recommended informative workshops for nurses and cooperation with hospice facilities...|$|R

O'Day's World Series appearances include {{four of the}} first five played. In his first three World Series, a two-umpire system was used, with the two alternating between <b>working</b> <b>home</b> plate and the bases. In his next three Series, four umpires were assigned, but they worked in two-man crews that officiated alternating games; not until the 1918 Series did all four work every game. During the 1920 World Series, O'Day was the base umpire when Bill Wambsganss executed the only unassisted triple play in Series history. Although it was not known at the time, O'Day became the oldest umpire in history at age 65 years, 9 months when he began the 1925 season; it was long believed that Emslie still held the mark, having retired {{at the end of}} the 1924 season at age 65 years, 8 months. At the end of his career, O'Day's total of 3,986 games as an umpire placed him behind only Tommy Connolly (4,337) and Emslie (4,228) in major league history.|$|E

40|$|The {{practice}} of <b>working</b> from <b>home</b> has become widespread in developed countries, {{and the numbers}} of regular home workers are steadily increasing. There are potentially positive implications for energy consumption associated with <b>home</b> <b>working,</b> but these depend on myriad variables. This qualitative study, {{based on interviews with}} regular home workers, provides a more in-depth perspective on how and why energy is used compared with quantitative models of household consumption. Ethnographic research data is analysed using insights from practice theory. Placing the practice at the heart of analysis, it explores meanings, materials and competences involved in <b>home</b> <b>working,</b> and attends to the affective experiences of practitioners. Considering <b>working</b> from <b>home</b> as an integrative practice, it explores how dispersed practices are incorporated into individual performances, bringing about affective satisfaction. Findings show that the {{practice of}} <b>working</b> from <b>home</b> is characterised by themes of comfort, control and flexibility, with implications for energy demand. It is argued that the synthesis of practice theory and affect can provide valuable insights for energy research. The paper discusses the implications for demand reduction, demand shifting and ‘smart’ controls, with reference to the role of employers, researchers, policy makers and home workers themselves...|$|R
