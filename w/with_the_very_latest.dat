25|$|Cameron's generalship in New Zealand was, {{with minor}} exceptions, {{of a very}} high standard. In particular, he was a general who welcomed new ideas and {{technology}} and quickly put them into action. Cameron ordered prefabricated, steel-clad gunboats from Australia, which were assembled and finished in New Zealand. Both the gunboats and the army were equipped <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>latest</b> Armstrong artillery, which were light, mobile, very accurate and fired an explosive shell. He appreciated the importance of irregular troops and allowed {{the creation of the}} Forest Rangers, who had their own unique organisation, uniform and lightweight arms including Bowie knives, revolvers and breech-loading carbines. In 1862, the telegram was first introduced to New Zealand, 18 years after its invention by Morse, and in 1863 a military telegraph was built from Auckland to Drury and later extended to the Waikato, allowing rapid communication between the front and Auckland. Cameron was quick to realise the importance of local knowledge and used Gorst, a missionary from the Waikato who spoke the Māori language, as a guide. He also used Waikato Māori who remained loyal to the crown as guides and to man a redoubt at Rangiriri once the Kingites had been defeated. A kūpapa Māori, familiar with the shallow waters of the Waikato Heads was used to guide the first gunboats through the Waikato River shoals. Cameron appreciated the importance of the surface coal seams at Huntly, which he used as fuel for his gunboats and supply steamers.|$|E
2500|$|A major {{attraction}} of Edwardes' shows was his glamorous, dancing corps of [...] "Gaiety Girls". These were fashionable, elegant young ladies, unlike the corseted actresses {{from the earlier}} burlesques. In Edwardes' shows, these ladies were, as The Sketch noted in its review of The Geisha in 1896, [...] "clothed in accordance <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>latest</b> and most extreme modes of the moment." [...] Many of the best-known London couturiers designed costumes for Edwardes' productions. The illustrated periodicals were eager to publish photographs of actresses in the latest stage hits, and so the theatre became an excellent way for clothiers to publicise their latest fashions.|$|E
6000|$|Gradually, out of {{the chaotic}} melee in which these titans were engaged had emerged one group more {{powerful}} than the rest and more respectable, whose leader was the Personality to whom I have before referred. He and his group had managed to gain control of certain conservative fortresses in various cities such as the Corn National Bank and the Ashuela Telephone Company--to mention two of many: Adolf Scherer was his ally, and the Boyne Iron Works, Limited, was soon to be merged by him into a greater corporation still. Leonard Dickinson might be called his local governor-general. We manned the parapets and kept our ears constantly to the ground to listen for the rumble of attacks; but sometimes they burst upon us fiercely and suddenly, without warning. Such was the assault on the Ashuela, which for years had exercised an apparently secure monopoly of the city's telephone service, which had been able to ignore with complacency the shrillest protests of unreasonable subscribers. Through the Pilot it was announced to the public that certain benevolent [...] "Eastern capitalists" [...] were ready to rescue them from their thraldom if the city would grant them a franchise. Mr. Lawler, the disinterestedness of whose newspaper could not be doubted, fanned the flame day by day, sent his reporters about the city gathering instances of the haughty neglect of the Ashuela, proclaiming its instruments antiquated compared with those used in more progressive cities, as compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>latest</b> inventions which the Automatic Company was ready to install provided they could get their franchise. And the prices! These, too, would fall--under competition. It was a clever campaign. If the city would give them a franchise, that Automatic Company--so well named! would provide automatic instruments. Each subscriber, by means of a numerical disk, could call up any other, subscriber; there would be no central operator, no listening, no tapping of wires; the number of calls would be unlimited. As a proof of the confidence of these Eastern gentlemen in our city, they were willing to spend five millions, and present more than six hundred telephones free to the city departments! What was fairer, more generous than this! There could be no doubt that popular enthusiasm was enlisted in behalf of the [...] "Eastern Capitalists," [...] who were made to appear in the light of Crusaders ready to rescue a groaning people from the thrall of monopoly. The excitement approached that of a presidential election, and became the dominant topic at quick-lunch counters and in street-cars. Cheap and efficient service! Down with the Bastille of monopoly! ...|$|E

50|$|This late tMRCA {{date for}} all of G2b in Europe raises the {{question}} of when G2b first entered Europe.

No one particular region seems to be more divergent than any other, and in fact, there doesn't seem to be any geographically correlated subclades within European G2b, with samples from each region matching some from other regions more closely than ones from the same region.|$|R

40|$|Graft arteriopathy, {{a leading}} cause of cardiac {{allograft}} failure, is associated with increased intimal smooth muscle cells, inflammatory cells, and accumulation of extracellular matrix. We hypothesized that cellular fibronectin plays a pivotal role in the progression of the allograft arteriopathy by directing the transendothelial trafficking of inflammatory cells through interaction of the connecting segment- 1 (CS 1) motif <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>late</b> antigen- 4 (VLA- 4) integrin, and tested this in vivo using a blocking peptide. Cholesterol-fed rabbits underwent heterotopic cardiac transplantation without immunosuppression. The treatment group (n = 7) received a synthetic CS 1 peptide (1 mg/kg per d, subcutaneously), and the controls (n = 7) received an inactive peptide (1 mg/kg per d, subcutaneously). At 7 - 8 d after transplantation, hearts were harvested and sectioned for morphometric analysis and immunohistochemical studies. We observed a > 50 % decrease in the incidence (P < 0. 001) and severity (P < 0. 001) of donor coronary artery intimal thickening in the CS 1 -treated compared <b>with</b> <b>the</b> control group. These findings correlated with reduced infiltration of T cells (P < 0. 05), a trend toward decreased expression of adhesion molecules (P < 0. 06), and less accumulation of fibronectin (P < 0. 03). Our data suggest that the VLA- 4 -fibronectin interaction is critical to the progression of the allograft arteriopathy by perpetuating the immune-inflammatory response in the vessel wall...|$|R
40|$|The {{antigenic}} {{relationship between}} human neuronal and lymphocyte cell surface antigens has been analyzed using heteroantisera raised against human {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC). The specificities of the crossreactive antigens were examined by immunoprecipitation of 125 I- labeled SK-N-SH cultured neuronal cells using rabbit anti-PBMC (RAPBMC) sera and compared to known specificities using mAb. The predominant reactivity of each rabbit antiserum tested against SK-N-SH cells was with three molecules of 130, 000, 160, 000, and 180, 000 Mr. These three chains comigrated with three molecules precipitated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>late</b> activation antigen (VLA) -specific mAb A- 1 A 5. Sequential precipitations with mAb A- 1 A 5 {{established that the}} three RAPBMC-precipitated bands were members of the VLA complex. This was confirmed by two-dimensional PAGE of the RAPBMC and A- 1 A 5 immunoprecipitates, which were indistinguishable from one another. The two-dimensional pattern was more complex than was anticipated from the heterodimeric model of VLA chain association, and suggests an additional 130, 000 Mr component of VLA. The three chains of the VLA complex precipitated by RAPBMC or mAb A- 1 A 5 from SK-N-SH neurons closely resembled the VLA pattern present on activated T cells, including the 180, 000 Mr activation-specific alpha 1 chain recognized by mAb TS 2 / 7. Normal brain cell membranes also contain VLA molecules that are precipitated by RAPBMC and mAb A- 1 A 5. Thus the VLA complex provides potentially important shared immunogens on human neurons and T cells...|$|R

50|$|When Scared Stiff was {{introduced}} in 1996, {{it was designed to}} have moving rubber boogieman figures mounted over the slingshots.

An opening between the feet of the slingshot plastics is still present on all production machines, as well as an entry in the game's manual about the feature.

6000|$|The waters around Fortress Monroe were thronged with a gallant {{array of}} ships {{of war and}} transports, wearing the Union flag,--"Old Glory," [...] as I hear it called in these days.

In pursuance of our official duty (which had no ascertainable limits), we went on board the flag-ship, and were shown over every part of her, and down into her depths, inspecting her gallant crew, her powerful armament, her mighty engines, and her furnaces, where the fires are always kept burning, as well at midnight as at noon, {{so that it would}} require only five minutes to put the vessel under full steam.
