5|$|Approximately 85% of {{vanadium}} produced {{is used as}} ferrovanadium or as a steel additive. The considerable {{increase of}} strength in steel containing small amounts of vanadium was discovered in the early 20th century. Vanadium forms stable nitrides and carbides, resulting in {{a significant increase in}} the strength of steel. From that time on, vanadium steel was used for applications in axles, bicycle frames, crankshafts, gears, and other critical components. There are two groups of vanadium steel alloys. Vanadium high-carbon steel alloys contain 0.15% to 0.25% vanadium, and high-speed tool steels (HSS) have a vanadium content of 1% to 5%. For high-speed tool steels, a hardness above HRC 60 can be achieved. HSS steel is used in surgical instruments and tools. Powder-metallurgic alloys contain up to 18% percent vanadium. The high content of vanadium carbides in those alloys increases <b>wear</b> <b>resistance</b> significantly. One application for those alloys is tools and knives.|$|E
5|$|Since moulds {{have been}} {{expensive}} to manufacture, they were usually only used in mass production {{where thousands of}} parts were being produced. Typical moulds are constructed from hardened steel, pre-hardened steel, aluminium, and/or beryllium-copper alloy. The choice of material to build a mould from is primarily one of economics; in general, steel moulds cost more to construct, but their longer lifespan will offset the higher initial cost over a higher number of parts made before wearing out. Pre-hardened steel moulds are less wear-resistant and are used for lower volume requirements or larger components; their typical steel hardness is 38–45 on the Rockwell-C scale. Hardened steel moulds are heat treated after machining; these are by far superior in terms of <b>wear</b> <b>resistance</b> and lifespan. Typical hardness ranges between 50 and 60 Rockwell-C (HRC). Aluminium moulds can cost substantially less, and when designed and machined with modern computerised equipment can be economical for moulding tens or even {{hundreds of thousands of}} parts. Beryllium copper is used in areas of the mould that require fast heat removal or areas that see the most shear heat generated. The moulds can be manufactured either by CNC machining or by using electrical discharge machining processes.|$|E

40|$|A clear {{dependence}} of the micro-cracking susceptibility on the base preheating temperature is observed for stellite coatings prepared by direct laser melting of metal-powder on the preheated chromium steel.

The observed deterioration of the corrosion and <b>wear</b> <b>resistances</b> of the coating with increase of the base preheating temperature is ascribed to the temperature dependent migration of Fe from the substrate into the coating. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

25|$|Firearms were {{a common}} item {{case-hardened}} in the past, as they required precision machining best done on low carbon alloys, yet needed the hardness and <b>wear</b> <b>resistance</b> {{of a higher}} carbon alloy. Many modern replicas of older firearms, particularly single action revolvers, are still made with case-hardened frames, or with case coloring, which simulates the mottled pattern left by traditional charcoal and bone case-hardening.|$|E
25|$|Case-hardening {{involves}} {{packing the}} low-carbon iron within a substance high in carbon, then heating this pack to encourage carbon migration into {{the surface of}} the iron. This forms a thin surface layer of higher carbon steel, with the carbon content gradually decreasing deeper from the surface. The resulting product combines much of the toughness of a low-carbon steel core, with the hardness and <b>wear</b> <b>resistance</b> of the outer high-carbon steel.|$|E

25|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} applying the carbon {{to the surface}} of the iron involved packing the iron in a mixture of ground bone and charcoal or a combination of leather, hooves, salt and urine, all inside a well-sealed box.

The longer the package is held at the high temperature, the deeper the carbon will diffuse into the surface.

2500|$|Typically, {{a sliding}} ski melts a thin and {{transitory}} film of lubricating layer of water, {{caused by the}} heat of friction between the ski and the snow in its passing. Colbeck suggests that the optimum water film thickness is in the range between 4 [...] and 12 μm. However, the heat generated by friction can be lost by conduction to a cold ski, thereby diminishing {{the production of the}} melt layer. At the other extreme, when the snow is wet and warm, heat generation creates a thicker film that can create increased capillary drag on the ski bottom. Kuzmin and Fuss suggest that the most favorable combination of ski base material properties to minimize ski sliding friction on snow include: increased hardness and lowered thermal conductivity of the base material to promote meltwater generation for lubrication, <b>wear</b> <b>resistance</b> in cold snow, and hydrophobicity to minimize capillary suction. These attributes are readily achievable with a PFTE base, which diminishes the value added by glide waxes.
