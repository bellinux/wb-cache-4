5|$|Psylliodes luridipennis {{is found}} {{throughout}} the highly limited range of the Lundy cabbage, including sheer sea cliffs and further inland at Millcombe House. The insects also {{found their way to}} Lundy cabbages artificially seeded within the cabbage's range within a year. It had been hypothesised that P. luridipennis and Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes may help pollinate the Lundy cabbage, but observations of the taxa indicate that neither visit flowers. <b>While</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> honey bees on Lundy, other species of winged insects are present. The plant may rely primarily upon pollen beetles of the genus Meligethes and the wind for pollination.|$|E

5|$|Foreign {{migration}} to Copenhagen, rising {{over the last}} three decades, has contributed to increasing religious diversity; the Grand Mosque of Copenhagen, the first in Denmark, opened in 2014.

5|$|Khaba is {{commonly}} {{thought to have}} built the Layer Pyramid, located at Zawyet el'Aryan, about 8km south-west of Giza. The pyramid's construction is typical of Third Dynasty masonry with mudbricks arranged in layers around a core made of rough blocks from the local bedrock. The pyramid was planned to be about 42 to 45 meters tall, but is now only 17 meters. It is unclear whether part of the pyramid has been eroded over time or its construction was never finished. <b>While</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>no</b> inscriptions directly relating the pyramid to Khaba, his serekh appears on stone bowls that were discovered in a nearby mastaba, known as Mastaba Z500.|$|E
