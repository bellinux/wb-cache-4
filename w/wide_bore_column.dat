40|$|Gas {{chromatography}} is {{the logical}} {{choice for the}} separation of volatile and semi-volatile mixtures and can provide exceptional peak capacity, particularly when used in a comprehensive two-dimensional configuration. Furthermore, coupling with a mass spectrometer provides {{a powerful tool for}} identification of components in complex mixtures. The key component in a comprehensive two-dimensional GC system is the modulation interface between the two separation dimensions, the primary purpose of which is to trap and release fractions of primary column effluent onto the secondary column whilst conserving the resolution of separated components from the first dimension throughout the two-dimensional separation. This thesis explored the use of pneumatic modulation interfaces for comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to a quadrupole mass spectrometer. Little research had been conducted into the use of pneumatic modulation with mass spectrometric detection due to a conflict between the high carrier gas flow required for pneumatic modulation and the requirement for high vacuum in the mass analyser. To commence, a series of one-dimensional separation approaches were investigated. A <b>wide</b> <b>bore</b> <b>column</b> was used under low pressure conditions for the analysis of moderately complex essential oils. Previous reports suggested that this technique was unsuitable for anything but simple mixtures, yet satisfactory separations of essential oils were possible. A high-temperature wax column was investigated subsequently, to determine if the claimed enhanced temperature stability would be beneficial for the second-dimension column in a comprehensive two-dimensional separation approach. This stationary phase was only available in narrow-bore dimensions and was highly satisfactory for cryogenic modulation but the internal diameter was not appropriate for pneumatic modulation due to the high head pressure required for operation. Next, a long, narrow-bore column was used to evaluate the conditions at which optimum efficiency could be generated for a translatable method. Use of fundamental relationships revealed a simple technique for determining a suitable column length based on a desired head pressure which provides the best trade-off between speed and efficiency optimisation. To conclude these one-dimensional investigations, an application is presented. Metabolite extracts from hop (Humulus lupulus L.) were obtained and separated using a GC–MS approach. Simple statistical analysis techniques were performed to establish the suitability of the separation approach for generating sufficient information to allow varietal classification of the samples. A range of modulation interfaces were explored to describe the suitability of such devices for GC×GC separation techniques. To commence, a commercial pneumatic modulation interface was used for the enantioseparation of a moderately complex essential oil. Results were critically evaluated in comparison to a thermally modulated approach, and suggested that the technique displayed significant potential as an alternative to traditional methods. Following this, a microfluidic Deans switch modulator was prepared. This utilised a switching system that only sampled a portion of the first-dimension column effluent for secondary separation. While exemplary separations of essential oil samples were achieved, it was clear that a total transfer method could provide superior results by improving sensitivity. To investigate this, a valve based pneumatic modulator was constructed and used in conjunction with the optimum column dimensions for the final investigation presented herein. Dual secondary columns were utilised to facilitate both flame ionisation and quadrupole mass spectrometric detection. This approach provides a powerful analytical tool for both qualitative and quantitative separation of complex samples such as those investigated in this study and would satisfy the requirements of many potential applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of correct determination {{of physical and}} chemical properties of natural gas is evident. The calculation of calorific value or hydrocarbon dew point requires detailed analysis as can be provided by gas chromatography. Analysis by gas chromatography is a necessary complement to direct measurement of physical properties. An accurate gas chromatographic analysis allows the calculation of various gas properties at the same time. Several schemes allowing accurate natural gas analysis by chromatography have been described in literature. Current column selection criteria to meet the requirements of a particular gas analysis will be presented. In the presentation the main emphasis will be on new developments in column technology for gas chromatography. Recent developments in capillary gas chromatography point in three directions: 1. Narrow <b>bore</b> thin film <b>columns</b> (typically 50 ~m inside diameter; 0. 05 ~m film thickness) allowing a high speed of separation and having large plate numbers per unit length. These columns having up to 1 million theoretical plates are eminently suited for a detailed analysis of the distribution of higher hydrocarbons in natural gas e. g. for dew point calculations. 2. <b>Wide</b> <b>bore</b> thick film <b>columns.</b> These columns with typical dimensions of 0. 5 mm inside diameter and a film thickness of 5 - 10 ~m of 'bonded phases', are relatively slow but offer improved resolution for the low boiling point components of natural gas. The sample capacity of a <b>wide</b> <b>bore</b> thick film <b>column</b> is at least two orders of magnitude larger than that of 50 ~m columns. This together with the large volumetric gas flows in <b>wide</b> <b>bore</b> <b>columns</b> enables their use in combination with heat conductivity detectors or FT-IR techniques. 3. The use of gas-solid chromatography in open tubular columns e. i. Molsieve 5 A PLOT columns for the analysis of permanent gases at ambient temperature; Aluminium oxide columns for highly selective separations of volatile hydrocarbons. A theoretical treatment will be presented showing the effect of column diameter and film thickness on speed of analysis, resolution, sample capacity, sample range, etc. The instrumental requirements of the different types of columns will be discussed.

For Qo the improvements can be neglected, and so the analysis can best be performed at Uopt. When the flow rate in the detector, Fd, is equal to the column flow rate Fc, the maximum permissible detector volume of concentration sensitive detectors is proportional to dc 2 up to dc 3, and so narrow <b>bore</b> <b>columns</b> require detectors of extremely small volume. Make-up gas has to be added when the actual volume is too large, thus deteriorating the detectability. Another approach, vacuum operation of the detector cel appears to be very attractive. On the other hand, when <b>wide</b> <b>bore</b> colums are used in combination with small volume concentration sensitive detectors, very small values of Qoc and Coc are obtainable when the abundant carrier gas can be removed before entering the detector cell.

40|$|Recent {{changes in}} {{environmental}} regulatory paradigms, such as EPA’s performance-based measurement systems (PBMS), are lowering method compliance barriers for laboratories {{working under the}} Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). One of the stated goals of PBMS is to educate the regulators and the regulated community on the inherent and intended flexibility of SW- 846 methods. Operating under EPA’s PBMS guidelines, laboratories could employ the flexibility of SW- 846 methods to simplify and improve purge and trap GC/MS volatile organic analyses (P/T GC/MS VOAs). Laboratories performing Method 8260 B for P/T GC/MS VOAs have two basic GC configuration options: <b>wide</b> <b>bore</b> <b>columns</b> connected to the mass spectrometer through a jet separator or narrow <b>bore</b> <b>columns</b> directly interfaced to the mass spectrometer. SW- 846 methodology recognizes both approaches as valid. The narrow bore column/direct interface approach is the better of the two techniques for most analyses when certain modifications are made. When newer purge and trap concentrator designs are employed and when several Method 8260 B instrument parameters are modified dramatic performance benefits result. This “enhanced ” narrow bore column/direct interface approach produces results such as reduced susceptibility to column contamination by high level samples, improved chromatographic behavior of early eluting and closely eluting compounds, analysis times under 20 minutes, and improved hardware ruggedness. The outcome is better quality data, higher sample throughput, and fewer instrument mechanical failures...|$|R

40|$|The chromatographic {{behaviour}} of four organophosphorus pesticides {{has been}} investigated, using capillary gas liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and packed and <b>wide</b> <b>bore</b> capillary gas liquid chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD). The {{first part of}} this thesis (Chapter 3) embodies the application of high performance capillary gas liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and the development of the methodology for analysis of pesticides in fruit and vegetable substrates. Manipulation of GC-MS data during the sample analysis is necessary in order to eliminate the problems arising from the complexity of the samples. The application of selected ion monitoring (SIM) in GC-MS is to a large extent limited by selection of the ion for monitoring, selection of internal standard, optimisation of electrometer zero, the electron multiplier voltage, the selected mass interval, column selection for GC-MS analysis and tuning of the quadrupole GC-MS. A major concern was with the determination of the optimum conditions for the analysis of substrates containing organophosphorus pesticides by GC-MS following solvent extraction (without clean up steps). The analysis of organophosphorus samples using GC-MS-SIM provides detection limits lower than Pg pesticide injected and very good recovery data. The second part (Chapter 4) deals with the application of GC-ECD. Here the role of packed column support, packed and <b>wide</b> <b>bore</b> capillary <b>column</b> temperature and detector temperature was investigated. Comparisons of the relative responses of the pesticides analysed (i) on packed columns and (ii) on <b>wide</b> <b>bore</b> capillary <b>column</b> under different column and detector cell temperatures were undertaken and the optimal condition for each of the organophosphorus pesticides was determined, under the optimal conditions the detection limits and recovery for fruit and vegetable samples were examined. The results from this method were correlated with the data obtained by GC-MS and found to be in very good agreement. The data obtained from analysis using GC-ECD was found to have a higher precision than that obtained by GC-MS, however GC-MS exhibited a higher selectivity for the determination of these pesticides...|$|R
40|$|Folic acid is an {{essential}} nutrient, and folate deficiency {{is associated with a}} variety of disorders including neural tube defects (during pregnancy) and heart disease. A fast, sensitive, and robust HPLC?tandem mass spectrometry (LC?MS?MS) method was developed for the quantification of free folic acid, tetrahydrofolate, 5 ‘-methyltetrahydrofolate, and 5 ‘-formyltetrahydrofolate in human plasma. Sample preparation required only acetonitrile precipitation of proteins followed by filtration instead of solid-phase extraction or solvent?solvent extraction as in other methods. The rapid and streamlined sample handling procedure minimized degradation of the highly unstable folate species. Hydrophilic interaction chromatography was used for additional sample cleanup on-line, and baseline separation and detection of all four folate species was achieved in less than 30 min. The folate species were detected using negative ion electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry with multiple reaction monitoring of the diagnostic fragment ions of each deprotonated molecule. The predominately organic (hydrophobic) solvent system combined with the microbore flow rate (50 ?L/min) used for the chromatography resulted in enhanced electrospray signal response compared to reversed-phase HPLC using a <b>wider</b> <b>bore</b> <b>column.</b> The recovery of all folate species (from spiked plasma) was > 97 % over a concentration range from 300 pg/L to 12 mg/L with intraday precision (RSD, n = 5) of 3. 7 ? 6. 5 %.

We developed an improved gas chromatographic (GC) method for the assay of 3, 5, 6 -trichloro- 2 -pyridinol (TCP) in the urine to use in the biological monitoring of exposure to chlorpyrifos. Urinary TCP was separated and determined accurately (C. V., 4 %) with high sensitivity (detection limit, 10 ng/ml) and recovery (recovery greater than 90 %) using a <b>wide</b> <b>bore</b> capillary <b>column</b> (WBC column). The accuracy and precision of the present GC method are satisfactory. The time course of urinary excretion of TCP was followed in workers. The urinary TCP level was low in the off-season and high in the busy season. Variation in the urinary TCP level corresponded to the termite control season and the length of the working period. The urinary TCP level showed a change reciprocal to the variations in the plasma cholinesterase activity. From these results, it is surmised that the urinary TCP level represents the extent of exposure to chlorpyrifos. The decrease in the level of cholinesterase activity is suggested to be due to exposure to chlorpyrifos. Determination of the urinary TCP level by GC using a WBC column is useful in the biological monitoring of chlorpyrifos in termite control workers and potentially has practical application to health care. </p...|$|R

In treating the effect of an increased film thickness, two approaches can be followed; either the separation temperature is kept constant, resulting in larger values of the capacity ratio, k, or the column temperature is increased such as to keep k constant. For normalized chromatographic conditions the effects of both approaches on the minimum plate height, optimum carrier gas velocity, and required plate number are described, finally yielding expressions for Qo and Co for both mass flow and concentration sensitive detectors. At constant temperature, Co always increases with the film thickness for mass flow sensitive detectors (e. g. FID). <b>Wide</b> <b>bore</b> thin film <b>columns</b> offer the lowest value of Co attainable. For concentration sensitive detectors (e. g.

The corresponding capacity ratio has a value between 0. 5 and 1. 5. At elevated temperatures (k constant) in combination with mass flow sensitive detectors, again an optimum film thickness exists, corresponding to a minimum value of Co. For constant capacity ratio Qo always increases with the film thickness for both types of detectors.

40|$|Most {{complementary}} medicines {{contain a}} multitude of chemical components, {{some of which are}} claimed to contribute to the biological activity of such products. Use of complementary medicines for preventative and therapeutic purposes is increasing rapidly worldwide. Unfortunately, although control of these products is essential to ensure quality, safety, and efficacy, the quality control of most herbal preparations is currently poor to non-existent, with little or no safety and efficacy data required to support the marketing and use of these products. The objective of this study was therefore to develop suitable analytical methods to qualitatively and quantitatively analyse the relevant components (rutin, isoquercitrin, hyperoside, quercitrin, quercetin, kaempferol, hypericin, pseudohypericin and hyperforin) in St John's Wort dosage forms for quality control purposes. A gradient HPLC method using a Luna 5 ·mC₁₈(2) 150 x 2. 00 mm internal diameter (i. d.) column and UV detection, was developed for the separation of six of the relevant flavonoid compounds in St John's Wort, namely rutin, isoquercitrin, hyperoside, quercitrin, quercetin and kaempferol. The development process involved a systematic investigation of gradient conditions, flow rate, and temperature. This method was subsequently applied to assay selected commercially available St John's Wort products. This system provided the necessary accuracy, precision and reproducibility and was associated with several advantages when compared to using standard bore (4. 60 mm i. d.) HPLC columns. The method developed is currently the only known method that separates all six relevant flavonoids in a reasonable run time (less than 20 minutes). It {{is also one of the}} few methods that has sufficient separation between rutin, isoquercitrin and hyperoside. A qualitative method for the fingerprinting of flavonoid components was also developed, using capillary electrophoresis (CE). CE is a rapidly growing powerful analytical technique for the separation of charged compounds. Micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) is a very powerful electrophoretic technique that is capable of selectively resolving both neutral and ionic solutes in a single run. A MEKC method suitable for the separation and determination of various flavonoid constituents used as marker compounds in Hypericum perforatum was developed. Investigations into the effect of pH, ionic strength, applied voltage and capillary dimensions on separation were performed. The optimised method was then applied to qualitatively analyse various St John's Wort products on the market. This method was found to be advantageous in that it was simple, cost-effective, required minimal sample preparation and utilised very small quantities of sample. Due to the vast differences in chemical properties between the various marker and active components in St John's Wort, it was necessary to develop separate analytical methods for the flavonoids and for the other three relevant compounds (hypericin, pseudohypericin and hyperforin). An isocratic HPLC method using a Luna 5 ·mC₁₈(2) 150 x 2. 00 mm (i. d.) column and UV detection was developed for the separation of hypericin, pseudohypericin and hyperforin. The development process involved a systematic investigation of buffer molarity, mobile phase composition, pH, flow rate, and temperature. This method was subsequently applied to assay selected commercially available St John's Wort products on the South African market. This system also provided the necessary accuracy, precision and reproducibility, as well as the advantages associated with the use of a narrow <b>bore</b> <b>column</b> as opposed to the use of the more commonly used <b>wider</b> <b>bore</b> <b>columns.</b> This method was validated and used to quantitate these three compounds in various commercial St John's Wort products. By applying this method to liquid chromatography – tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS), qualitative analyses of the same products was performed to obtain confirmation of the quantitative HPLC results. Mass spectrometry is a powerful detection tool that is more selective and specific than many detection systems used with HPLC. Natural medicines usually constitute {{a multitude of}} constituents with much potential interference. In this regard LC-MS-MS is a powerful tool, with its ability to unequivocally identify target analytes regardless of the presence of interferences or complex matrices. ESI-MS-MS was used for the qualitative analysis of the content of the naphthodianthrones and hyperforin in the respective tablet products assayed with HPLC. LC-MS-MS analyses were performed in order to identify the constituents and to verify the specificity of the HPLC method. High inter-product and inter-batch variability was observed for all nine compounds assayed. These quantitative results were confirmed with the respective qualitative analyses. This study confirms the need for strict quality control of herbal medicinal products commercially available to consumers. ...|$|R

50|$|In contrast, the alto flute has a <b>wider</b> <b>bore</b> in {{relation}} to its tube length. This is to provide it with extra power in the bottom register, but this causes the alto problems with intonation and facility of sounding some notes in its top register.|$|R
40|$|For {{thin film}} columns {{operating}} {{under conditions of}} high inlet to outlet pressure ratio an equation will be given describing the dependance of analysis time on resolution. column selectivity, capacity factor, column radius, diffusivity and viscosity of the carrier gas. It will be shown that minimum analysis time for a given resolution is always obtained when the column is operated with a vacuum outlet, thus favouring the direct coupling without interfaces of capillary columns and mass spectrometers. Another important conclusion is the direct proportionality between column radius and analysis time, showing {{the advantage of the}} use of very narrow <b>bore</b> <b>columns.</b> Several applications of narrow <b>bore</b> <b>columns,</b> 50 wm and less, in combination with FlD and EC-detection, will be presented. Sample capacity and sample range of these columns will be discussed. Coupling of 50 wm columns to a mass spectrometer is shown to be beneficial in terms of speed and sensitivity. EI spectra can be identified from even 50 pg amounts. S. l. H. in the NICI mode enables detection limits in the femtogram level...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUltra high field magnets for {{research}} applications require development of insert coils developed from high temperature superconductor materials (HTS) like Bi- 2212 round wires. Integration of an outer, <b>wide</b> <b>bore,</b> magnet fabricated from low temperature superconductor materials (LTS) coils with insert HTS coils will entail {{understanding of the}} quench behavior of the combined system and crucial for the safe energization and operation of compact high field magnets where quench management of LTS differ for those of HTS coils. In the present study, the quench behavior of the HTS coils and the LTS coils used to provide the background field were measured and analyzed. The analysis is highly relevant {{to the design of}} high field <b>wide</b> <b>bore</b> magnets as well as ultra high field magnets using integrated LTS and HTS coils...|$|R
40|$|Reduction of {{the column}} {{diameter}} has proved a highly efficient tool {{to increase the speed}} of analysis. Unfortunately the requirements for instrumental design with respect to sample input band width, low dead volume interfacing and time constants of detection and registration systems are the more critical the smaller the inside diameter. Recently we reported input band widths as low as 1 ms for gaseous samples at ppm concentration levels, without any preconcentration, in a study with narrow <b>bore</b> <b>columns</b> and thermal conductivity detection. In this study a simple versatile micro on-column cold trap/thermodesorption enrichment system for narrow <b>bore</b> <b>columns</b> is introduced and evaluated. The combination of considerable sample enrichment and preservation of the compatibility of the required input band width with column dimensions is critically examined. The process of thermodesorption (reinjection) which is the most critical step, is particularly emphasized. The system consists of a short aluminum coated fused silica or metal capillary with a low mass and a low cost electrical heating. Input band widths down to 1 ms are obtained without extreme demands on electrical power (300 Watt). The potential of the system is illustrated with some extremely fast separations...|$|R
