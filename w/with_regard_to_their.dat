5|$|Thamnophilidae {{was removed}} from Formicariidae, leaving behind the antthrushes and antpittas, due to {{recognition}} of differences {{in the structure of}} the breastbone (sternum) and syrinx, and Sibley and Ahlquist's examination of DNAâ€“DNA hybridization. The Thamnophilidae antbirds are members of the infraorder Tyrannides (or tracheophone suboscines), one of two infraorders in the suborder Tyranni. The Thamnophilidae are now thought to occupy a fairly basal position within the infraorder, i. e. <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> relatives the antthrushes and antpittas, tapaculos, gnateaters, and also the ovenbirds. The sister group of the Thamnophilidae is thought to be the gnateaters. The ovenbirds, tapaculos, antthrushes and antpittas are thought to represent a different radiation of that early split.|$|E
5|$|Communities such as AVEN can be {{beneficial}} to those in search of answers to solve a crisis of identity <b>with</b> <b>regard</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> possible asexuality. Individuals go {{through a series of}} emotional processes that end with their identifying with the asexual community. They first realize that their sexual attractions differ from those of most of society. This difference leads to questioning whether the way they feel is acceptable, and possible reasons for why they feel this way. Pathological beliefs tend to follow, in which, in some cases, they may seek medical help because they feel they have a disease. Self-understanding is usually reached when they find a definition that matches their feelings. Asexuality communities provide support and information that allows newly identified asexuals to move from self-clarification to identifying on a communal level, which can be empowering, because they now have something to associate with, which gives normality to this overall socially-isolating situation.|$|E

Additionally, JSON says nothing about the treatment of signed zeros: whether 0.0 is distinct from -0.0.
