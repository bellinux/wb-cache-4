5|$|By mid-October, Diệm and Nhu knew of {{the coup}} plans, but {{did not know that}} Đính was firmly among them, {{although}} they were wary of him. Nhu then decided to outwit the generals with a counter-plot. The generals heard of this and decided to counteract him. The other generals were still suspicious of Đính, fearing he would betray them. Having discovered that Nhu was trying to use him to trap them, and not sure <b>which</b> <b>side</b> he was really on, they promised to make him interior minister and offered other rewards if he helped to overthrow the Ngô brothers.|$|E
5|$|Early in 197BC, Flamininus summoned Attalus to {{join him}} at Elateia (now in Roman hands) and from there they {{traveled}} together to attend a Boeotian council in Thebes to discuss <b>which</b> <b>side</b> Boeotia would take in the war. At the council Attalus spoke first, reminding the Boeotians of the many things he and his ancestors had done for them, but during his address he stopped talking and collapsed, with {{one side of his}} body paralyzed. Attalus was taken back to Pergamon, where he died {{around the time of the}} Battle of Cynoscephalae, which brought about the end of the Second Macedonian War.|$|E
5|$|Eowa {{was killed}} at Maserfield along with Oswald, {{although}} on <b>which</b> <b>side</b> he fought is unknown. It {{may well be}} that he fought as a dependent ally of Oswald against Penda. If Eowa was in fact dominant among the Mercians during the period leading up to the battle, then his death could have marked what the author of the Historia Brittonum regarded as the beginning of Penda's ten-year reign. Thus it may be that Penda prevailed not only over the Northumbrians but also over his rivals among the Mercians.|$|E

50|$|In 1975 the Lebanese Civil War broke out. Far bloodier {{than its}} 1950s prelude, it {{featured}} most PLO factions {{on the side}} of the Lebanese National Movement, specially with the mainly Sunni al-Murabitun. The right-wing Lebanese Front had long seen the PLO as a threat to their supremacy in Lebanon's volatile sectarian balance. The Lebanese National Movement and PLO were seen too as a threat to Syria, as they opposed Syrian strategy. As a result, the Rejectionist Front itself became split between the PFLP and various smaller groups <b>which</b> <b>sided</b> with the LNM and Fatah, and as-Saiqa and the PFLP-General Command <b>which</b> <b>sided</b> with Syria.|$|R

5|$|Hurdt {{wanted to}} attack Trunajaya's stronghold Kediri from Surabaya in coastal East Java, {{which would be}} the {{shortest}} route. However, Amangkurat II proposed that the troops be divided into columns and march along a lengthy overland route. He wanted the VOC-Mataram forces to march slowly through more areas in order to impress factions that were wavering over <b>which</b> <b>side</b> to take. This argument convinced Hurdt, and they decided to split the army into three different columns travelling via different overland routes from coastal Central Java to Kediri in inland East Java. In addition, a VOC merchant, Willem Bastinck, was to go to Surabaya to seek out Karaeng Galesonga former Trunajaya ally, whose allegiance was wavering, and whose help Mataram and the VOC hoped to enlistand his followers.|$|E
5|$|In shame, Cet {{leaves the}} pig to Conall, who {{rightfully}} claims the belly as his portion, a burden for nine men, {{leaving only the}} fore-trotters to the Connachta. Dissatisfied with their meagre share, the Connachta rise against the Ulaid, and a drinking bout breaks out in the hostel and spills out into the courtyard outside. Fergus rips up a great oak tree from the ground by the roots. Mac Da Thó unleashes Ailbe to see <b>which</b> <b>side</b> it would choose; Ailbe sides with the Ulaid, and precipitates the rout of the Connachta. The dog itself is decapitated by Aillil's charioteer Fer Loga at Mag nAilbi.|$|E

5|$|Irish {{merchant}} shipping {{saw to it}} that vital imports continued to arrive and exports, mainly food supplies to Great Britain, were delivered. Irish ships sailed unarmed and usually alone, identifying themselves as neutrals with bright lights and by painting the Irish tricolour and EIRE in large letters on their sides and decks. Nonetheless twenty percent of seamen serving in Irish ships perished, victims of a war not their own: attacked by both sides, though predominantly by the Axis powers. Often, Allied convoys could not stop to pick up survivors, while Irish ships always answered SOS signals and stopped to rescue survivors, irrespective of <b>which</b> <b>side</b> they belonged to. Irish ships rescued 534 seamen.|$|E
5|$|It {{is known}} from Byzantine sources that the Rus' caught Constantinople unprepared, while the empire was preoccupied by the ongoing Arab–Byzantine wars {{and unable to}} deal with the Rus' threat. After pillaging the suburbs of the Byzantine capital, the Rus' retreated, {{although}} the nature of this withdrawal, and indeed <b>which</b> <b>side</b> was victorious, is subject to debate. The event gave rise to a later Orthodox Christian tradition, which ascribed the deliverance of Constantinople to a miraculous intervention by the Theotokos.|$|E
5|$|Powell Clayton, a 35-year-old former Brigadier General in the Union Army who {{remained}} in Arkansas after marrying an Arkansas woman, was elected governor as a Republican in April, 1868. The election was scarred with irregularities. For example, the return of votes in Pulaski County exceeded the number of registered voters. Also, the registrars, who controlled the distribution of ballots, admitted that they had given ballots to voters from other counties if they could show a valid registration certificate. Both sides claimed election fraud and voter intimidation: armed parties had been stationed on roads to keep voters away from the polls. General Gillem, commander of the military district that included Arkansas, wrote to General Grant {{that it would take}} months to sort out <b>which</b> <b>side</b> had committed the greater election fraud.|$|E

The castle was abandoned in 1869, and in 1872 the San-no-maru palace collapsed due to weight of heavy snow. In 1873, a fire {{swept through the}} remaining structures.

5|$|The {{accession}} of Frederick, a {{child who}} would then become also the Holy Roman Emperor FrederickII in 1197, greatly affected the immediate future of Sicily. For a land so used to centralised royal authority, the king's young age caused a serious power vacuum. His uncle Philip of Swabia moved to secure Frederick's inheritance by appointing Markward von Anweiler, margrave of Ancona, regent in 1198. Meanwhile, Pope InnocentIII had reasserted papal authority in Sicily, but recognised Frederick's rights. The pope was to see papal power decrease steadily {{over the next decade}} and was unsure about <b>which</b> <b>side</b> to back at many junctures.|$|E

In Revelation, the Avatar rallies both sides against the true mastermind behind the war. The gameplay, which revolves around tactical movement of units across a grid-based battlefield, shares many mechanics with previous Fire Emblem games, although some elements are unique to each scenario.|$|E
5|$|Viv wakes to find Bond gone, {{leaving a}} note in which he {{promises}} to send her police assistance and which he concludes by telling her not to dwell {{too much on the}} ugly events through which she has just lived. As Viv finishes reading the note, a large police detachment arrives. After taking her statement, the officer in charge of the detail reiterates Bond's advice, but also warns Viv that all men involved in violent crime and espionage, regardless of <b>which</b> <b>side</b> they are on—including Bond himself—are dangerous and that Viv should avoid them. Viv reflects on this as she motors off {{at the end of the}} book, continuing her tour of America, but despite the officer's warning still devoted to the memory of the spy who loved her.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate the visible and invisible aspects of identity represented on the Instagram account Humans of New York. By analyzing both the images and which people were represented, but also the underlying identity aspects and patterns found in the stories of people in the captions. These sides of our identity, in other words, identity aspects, are important when we design our public identity {{on social media}}.

5|$|When {{reporting}} to Secretary Eustis, Harrison informed him the battle occurred near the Tippecanoe River (which {{led to its}} naming), and he feared an imminent reprisal attack. The first dispatch did not make clear <b>which</b> <b>side</b> had won the conflict, and the secretary at first interpreted it as a defeat. The follow-up dispatch made the U.S. victory clear. When no second attack came, {{the defeat of the}} Shawnee was more certain. Eustis demanded to know why Harrison had not taken adequate precautions in fortifying his camp against attacks. Harrison countered by saying he had considered the position strong enough. The dispute was the catalyst of a disagreement between Harrison and the Department of War that continued into the War of 1812.|$|E

5|$|As Stauffenberg flies back to Berlin, Olbricht {{refuses to}} {{mobilize}} the Reserve Army until he knows without a doubt that Hitler is dead (if Hitler isn't dead, Olbricht will be arrested for having the reserve army mobilized without Fromm's permission). Behind Olbricht's back, Mertz forges his signature and issues the orders anyway. With Operation Valkyrie underway, Stauffenberg and his fellow plotters order the arrest of Nazi party leaders and SS officers, convincing lower officers that the Party and the SS are staging a coup. As Army soldiers begin {{to take control of}} Berlin's government ministries, including SS headquarters, mid-level officers relaying the orders begin to wonder <b>which</b> <b>side</b> they should be fighting for. Rumors reach Berlin that Hitler survived the blast, but Stauffenberg dismisses them as SS propaganda. Meanwhile, Fromm learns from Field Marshal Keitel that Hitler is still alive. The General refuses to join the plotters, resulting in them detaining him. Major Otto Ernst Remer of the Reserve Army prepares to arrest Goebbels, but is stopped when Goebbels connects him by phone to Hitler.|$|E
