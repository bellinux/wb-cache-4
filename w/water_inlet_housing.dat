40|$|This study aims at {{improving}} {{the performance of}} a waste heat driven adsorption chiller by applying a novel composite adsorbent which is synthesized from activated carbon impregnated by soaking in sodium silicate solution and then in calcium chloride solution. Modeling is performed to analyze the influence of the hot <b>water</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature, cooling <b>water</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature, chilled <b>water</b> <b>inlet</b> temperatures, and adsorption/desorption cycle time on the specific cooling power (SCP) and coefficient of performance (COP) of the chiller system with the composite adsorbent. The simulation calculation indicates a COP value of 0. 65 with a driving source temperature of 85 °C in combination with coolant <b>inlet</b> and chilled <b>water</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature of 30 °C and 14 °C, respectively. The most optimum adsorption-desorption cycle time is approximately 360 s based on the performance from COP and SCP. The delivered chilled water temperature is about 9 °C under these operating conditions, achieving a SCP of 380 W/kg. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|An <b>inlet</b> <b>housing</b> for a partial-admission turbine {{has been}} {{designed}} to cause the inlet airflow to make a smooth transition from an open circular inlet to an inlet slot. The smooth flow is required for purposes of measuring inlet flow characteristics and maximizing the efficiency of the turbine. A partial-admission turbine is a turbine in which the inlet slot occupies less than a complete circle around the rotor axis. In this case, the inlet slot occupies a 90 arc. The present special inlet-housing design is needed because the "bull nose" shape of a conventional turbine <b>inlet</b> <b>housing</b> fails to provide the required smooth transition in a partial-admission configuration and thereby gives rise to a loss of turbine efficiency and inaccuracies in inlet flow measurements. Upon entering the <b>inlet</b> <b>housing</b> through the circular opening, the flow encounters a "tongue"-shaped passageway, which serves as a ramp that diverts the flow to the first of two straight passages. This first passageway occupies a 90 arc and has a length equal to two passage heights. Instrumentation rakes for measuring the characteristics of the inlet flow are installed in this passageway. Just past the first straight passageway is the second one, which is narrower and leads to the 90 turbine inlet slot. This passageway is used to smooth the flow immediately prior to its passage through the turbine inlet slot. The length of this second passageway equals the length of the chord of a turbine vane. The <b>inlet</b> <b>housing</b> incorporates small ports for measuring static pressures at various locations of the flow, and incorporates bosses for the installation of the instrumentation rakes. The <b>inlet</b> <b>housing</b> also includes a flange at its inlet end for attachment to a circular inlet duct and a flange at its outlet end for attachment to the outer casing of the turbine...|$|R

A detailed theoretical method for energy and exergy analysis of the collector is provided. The method is also evaluated by experiments. The results showed a good agreement between the experiment and theory. Using the theoretical model, the effect of different parameters on the collector’s energy and exergy efficiency has been investigated. It is concluded that <b>inlet</b> <b>water</b> temperature, <b>inlet</b> <b>water</b> mass flow rate, the transmittance of tubes and absorptance of the absorber surface have a direct effect on the energy and exergy efficiency of the heat pipe evacuated tube solar collector.

40|$|Abstract The {{effects of}} treated and {{untreated}} <b>water</b> <b>inlets</b> with macrophytes on {{the improvement of}} water quality and zooplankton community were evaluated in a fish pond with continuous water flow. Water and zooplankton samples were retrieved at four sites during nine months. There were differences (p< 0. 01) between <b>inlet</b> <b>water</b> from fish pond and <b>inlet</b> <b>water</b> from canal with macrophytes, featuring higher concentrations of nutrient load, mainly TAN and TP in the former. The <b>inlet</b> <b>water</b> from fish pond contained a higher number of abundant species (9 species), whilst the water supply from the canal with macrophytes had a greater richness (31 species) of zooplankton species. Results showed that <b>inlet</b> <b>water</b> without macrophytes directly affected {{the characteristics of the}} water column and the dominance of zooplankton species such as Thermocyclops decipiens, and greater abundance of Rotifera species. Since aquatic plants in the <b>inlet</b> <b>water</b> of fish pond analyzed showed lower allochthonous material loads from the previous fish pond, the management adopted with macrophytes may be applied to avoid eutrophication risks, common in farm ponds...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{global warming}} and energy {{shortage}} have {{become more and more}} serious as economies develop rapidly all over the world. Adsorption cooling systems powered by solar energy or waste heat have drawn increasing attention, as such systems need neither CFCs nor HCFCs as the working fluid and neither fossil fuel nor electricity to drive them. Composite adsorbents were synthesized from activated carbon, silica-gel and CaCl 2. The optimized condition for adsorption cooling systems was obtained when raw activated carbon was impregnated by soaking in 10 wt. % sodium silicate solution for 48 hours and then in 30 wt. % CaCl 2 solution for 48 hours. A 0. 805 kg kg- 1 of difference in equilibrium water uptake between 25 °C and 115 °C was recorded at atmospheric pressure. Besides, an adsorption rate test unit was built to study the adsorption isotherms and adsorption rates in which 0. 23 kg kg- 1 of adsorption capacity was recorded at 27 °C with a water vapor pressure of 900 Pa. The performance of a waste heat driven adsorption chiller by applying the novel composite adsorbent (silica activated carbon/CaCl 2) was also studied. Modeling was performed to analyze the influence of the hot <b>water</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature, cooling <b>water</b> <b>inlet</b> temperature, chilled <b>water</b> <b>inlet</b> temperatures, and adsorption/desorption cycle time on the SCP and COP of the chiller system with the composite adsorbent.
