25|$|The wrong-way car chase on a Los Angeles freeway {{sequence}} {{was one of}} {{the last}} things shot in the film and it took six weeks to shoot. At this point, Friedkin was working with a very stripped down crew. He came up with the idea of staging the chase against the flow of traffic on February 25, 1963 when he was driving home from a wedding in Chicago. He fell asleep at the wheel and woke up in the wrong lane with oncoming traffic heading straight for him. He swerved back to his side of the road and for the next 20 years <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> was going to use it in a film. He told stunt coordinator Buddy Joe Hooker that if they could come up with a chase better than the one in The French Connection then it would be in the film. If not, he would not use it. Petersen did a lot of his own driving during this sequence and actor John Pankow's stressed out reactions were real. Three weekends were spent on sections of the Terminal Island Freeway near Wilmington, California that were closed for four hours at a time to allow the crew to stage the chaotic chase. With delays, the film ran a reported $1 million over budget.|$|E
500|$|Parambrata Chatterjee {{said in an}} {{interview}} that he did not identify with the Rana character, owing to the difference between his own urban upbringing and Rana's rural background. Chatterjee visited police stations and did some research [...] "on their work, mindset and other relevant things" [...] to prepare for the role. The character Khan was envisaged as a ruthless, arrogant, expletive-spewing officer who cares nothing about the emotional or social consequences of his behaviour. Siddiqui said that he was surprised on being offered the role, and <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> could portray the arrogance needed for the character. Ghosh built Khan as a character with lean physical build but full of mental strength, loyalty and patriotism. Khan smokes a relatively cheap brand of cigarette (Gold Flake) despite his high official post; Siddiqui had smoked that brand of cigarette throughout his struggling days in Bollywood and thereafter.|$|E
500|$|While {{attending}} a house party near St. Charles, he met {{and fell in}} love with a farmer's daughter, Dellora Baker. Gates proposed to her at one of the house parties. [...] Dellora was willing to accept Gates' proposal, but <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> would be able to provide for a wife, as his only income came from winning at the railroad poker games. When his father discovered Gates in a poker game with some railroad men in the family's barn, Asel told his son he was no good and would never be any good. Only Mary's mediation stopped her son from leaving home. With the realization that he needed more education than grammar school had provided, he announced to his parents that he would be enrolling in some local college classes. Gates attended some courses at nearby Wheaton College and graduated from North Central College in 1876. [...] He had little opportunity to put his new business education to work, as the financial Panic of 1873 began just as he was completing his college work. In order to be able to marry Dellora, Gates accepted every type of job he could get for the next year; most of them were for farm work. Gates and Dellora were married on February 25, 1874.|$|E

2500|$|After the exhibit, he {{continued}} on to Vitebsk, where {{he planned to}} stay {{only long enough to}} marry Bella. However, after a few weeks, the First World War began, closing the Russian border for an indefinite period. A year later he married Bella Rosenfeld and they had their first child, Ida. Before the marriage, Chagall had difficulty convincing Bella's parents that he would be a suitable husband for their daughter. They were worried about her marrying a painter from a poor family and <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> would support her. Becoming a successful artist now became a goal and inspiration. According to Lewis, [...] "he euphoric paintings of this time, which show the young couple floating balloon-like over Vitebsk—its wooden buildings faceted in the Delaunay manner—are the most lighthearted of his career". His wedding pictures were also a subject he would return to in later years as he thought about this period of his life.|$|E
2500|$|The next week, Kim {{notices that}} Ray has {{a string of}} missed calls on his mobile phone, and {{suspects}} he is having an affair. All About Soap said that Ray is showing all the signs of having an affair, but has no scenes with Kat, which they said would be [...] "crucial" [...] if he {{was having an affair}} with her. They went on to say that if Ray reveals what he is up to, he could be the first suspect to be eliminated. Soaplife said that Kat never has her mobile out of her hand, so when Kim catches Ray texting a mystery woman, it could mean that he is texting Kat. Inside Soap also wondered if this was evidence of Ray being Kat's secret lover. Carena Crawford from All About Soap said that when Ray is seen with flowers heading for the tube and on the phone saying he is meeting the person he is speaking to, at the same time Kat is on her phone arranging to meet her lover, she thought it was [...] "the biggest clue yet" [...] that it could be Ray, especially when they later return to the pub at the same time. Inside Soap noticed in that week that episodes were [...] "desperately trying to rule out Jack" [...] when he has sex with three other women. They felt it could be a red herring, saying [...] "We reckon all this seduction is supposed to make us turn a blind eye to Jack's antics—but [...] we're keeping them peeled where [...] is concerned!" [...] They also <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> could find the time to meet these women if he was seeing Kat as well.|$|E
60|$|He <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> {{would get}} rid of the case he had bought the week before.|$|E

6000|$|... "If {{he is just}} roaming around I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> {{manages to}} live," [...] said Dave. [...] "And where does he get all that outlandish outfit?" ...|$|R
60|$|And Pen {{looked out}} and beheld {{his first love}} once again--and <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> ever could have loved her.|$|E
60|$|Susie {{paused for}} a minute or two. She <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> would accept the {{suggestion}} that was in her mind.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps he is {{an escaped}} madman," [...] I thought; and <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> had strayed so far from seats of {{education}} and learning.|$|E
60|$|And {{then when}} he looks back, he is {{astonished}} at himself. <b>He</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> could dare so much; <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> could endure so much; <b>wonders</b> <b>how</b> the right thought came into {{his head at the}} right moment. He hardly knows himself again. It seems to him, when he thinks over it all, like a grand and awful dream. And the world is astonished at him likewise. They cry, 'Who would have thought there was so much in this man? who would have expected such things of him?' And they call him a hero--and so he is.|$|R

60|$|I <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> had got my address, and on {{that problem}} light was {{immediately}} cast by Mrs. Medley, who returned, bearing an envelope.|$|E
60|$|He {{stretched}} {{himself in}} his bed as a dog stretches himself. He <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> was going to endure that ceaseless aching of his soul.|$|E
60|$|Jim frowned. Jake's pretended {{indifference}} was prudent, {{but he had}} overdone the thing. While Jim <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> {{could put}} the matter right Carrie interposed.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Review?" [...] <b>He</b> {{seemed to}} <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> could best {{describe}} it. This resulted however {{but in a}} sketch. [...] "It's her tribute to the ideal." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is good," [...] the Rajah replied, {{in his own}} tongue, and {{in a tone of}} relief. [...] "I was <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> {{would get}} on with us.|$|R

6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] said Mr. Wilks, [...] "o' course not. I {{was only}} a sort o' <b>wondering</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> {{was going to be}} persuaded to go if 'e ain't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! ha!" [...] cried Richard. [...] "I <b>wonder</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> likes it. I {{wonder if}} he remembers holding me up to the window, and vowing that he meant me only good!" ...|$|R
60|$|She <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> knew so much, as he {{had never}} seemed to favor her with even a glance when by chance they met in the street. But perhaps Ingua had told him.|$|E
6000|$|After hearing this, the Prince <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> <b>he</b> {{could get}} a message {{conveyed}} to Finland. He heard one swallow say to another: [...] "Come, let us fly to Finland; we can build better nests there." ...|$|E
