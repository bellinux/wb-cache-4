500|$|Stargate {{producers}} {{were not}} sure actor Richard Dean Anderson would return for the episode, so they devised many scenes where Anderson was [...] "in" [...] the episode but not actually shown. [...] However, Anderson was willing to return and appeared in several scenes. In the DVD special Stargate SG-1: Behind the 200th Cooper said, [...] "it {{was a big deal}} for us to have [...] back for the 200th episode. We obviously didn't think <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> without him." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{journalist}} David Miller, {{writing for}} [...] The Times, described Cambridge's victory as [...] "crushingly conclusive". [...] Cambridge's Malcolm Baker said: [...] "We knew <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> after about 25 strokes." [...] Behrens explained [...] "Our strength {{was that we}} were more uniform than Oxford. [...] We have proved that {{you do not have to}} be an Olympic champion to win the Boat Race." [...] The Oxford Boat Club president Pinsent conceded: [...] "They put right a lot of mistakes they have made in the past, and they rowed outstandingly well." [...] Spracklen agreed: [...] "Cambridge got too far away. [...] They were a better boat in that race. [...] All credit to them." [...] Cambridge's number two, David Gillard, said [...] "there was a lot of revenge out there".|$|E
500|$|Anthony Mackie {{said the}} Russo {{brothers}} relied on minimal use of computer-generated imagery, stating, [...] "The Russos, {{what they did}} that was so great was, they wanted to stay with live action, which is a dying art form. If they can build it, they built it. If <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> we did it. They wanted to do as little CGI as possible. That's why the movie looks so great." [...] Nevertheless, six special effects companies are involved in creating the visual effects of the film, including Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Scanline VFX, Lola VFX, Luma Pictures, Whiskytree and The Embassy, with previsualization completed by Proof. The film contained 2,500 visual effects shots, with 900 worked on by ILM. The film featured extensive use of digital doubles. Russell Earl, ILM visual effects supervisor, said, [...] "The character that we did the most work on was Falcon. We {{knew we were going}} to do CG wings. We also did some shots with wires and some with stunt doubles and head replacement. And we needed a very good digital double." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{writing process}} {{consumed}} approximately six months, including three months creating notes and analyzing the novel. Zaillian noted that as time progressed, the writing accelerated. [...] "As {{soon as you}} start making decisions," [...] he explained, [...] "you start cutting off {{all of the other}} possibilities of things that could happen. [...] So with every decision that you make you are removing a whole bunch of other possibilities of where that story can go or what that character can do." [...] Given the book's sizable length, Zaillian deleted elements to match Fincher's desired running time. Even so, Zaillan took significant departures from the book. To Zaillian, there was always a [...] "low-grade" [...] anxiety, [...] "but I was never doing anything specifically to please or displease," [...] he continued. [...] "I was simply trying to tell the story the best way I could, and push that out of my mind. I didn't change anything {{just for the sake of}} changing it. There's a lot right about the book, but that part, I thought <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> a different way, and it could be a nice surprise for the people that have read it." ...|$|E
500|$|Connie Talbot {{entered the}} public eye appearing, aged six, on the first series of the reality {{programme}} Britain's Got Talent, reaching the final. After briefly recording with Sony BMG, Talbot was signed to Rainbow Recording Company, {{an offshoot of the}} label Rhythm Riders made specifically for her. To produce Over the Rainbow, Talbot worked with John Arnison, then-manager to Gabrielle and Billy Ocean, and Marc Marot, a former managing director of Island Records. It was produced and mixed by Simon Hill and Rob May. A recording schedule was worked out so that Talbot could continue with her normal school activities while recording the album in her aunt Vicky's spare bedroom, which her mother described as [...] "a better solution" [...] than the one offered by Sony BMG, [...] "which has not robbed her of her childhood". Talbot said that [...] "it was just amazing that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> in my auntie's house". Arnison and Marot asked the Talbot family to [...] "write down a list of the songs that Connie would sing at her birthday party" [...] to help choose the track listing, and then [...] "thought long and hard" [...] about including more adult songs on the album. Talbot herself insisted that they should.|$|E
500|$|In December 2007, Larter and {{her then}} {{longtime}} boyfriend, Hayes MacArthur, were engaged to marry. They had {{met on the}} set of National Lampoon's Homo Erectus. In a 2007 interview with Cosmo, Larter said [...] "I told my boyfriend after three weeks that I wanted to marry him and that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> tomorrow." [...] On August 1, 2009, Larter married MacArthur in an intimate outdoor ceremony which took place at MacArthur's parent's estate in Kennebunkport, Maine. During the ceremony, guests arrived via trolleys to the sounds of Irish music playing in honor of MacArthur's heritage; among the invited was Larter's close friend Amy Smart. The couple later purchased a three-story home in the Hollywood Hills for $2.9 million. On July 20, 2010, Larter announced that she and MacArthur were expecting their first child and later, on the September 10 episode of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, announced that she was expecting a boy. Larter admitted that she and MacArthur left the country for Europe in an effort to hide the news of the pregnancy. Larter gave birth to the couple's son, Theodore Hayes MacArthur, on December 20, 2010. In August 2014, Larter confirmed that she and MacArthur were expecting their second child that winter. She gave birth to her second child, a girl named Vivienne Margaret on January 15, 2015.|$|E

500|$|The Children's Television Workshop (CTW, later Sesame Workshop), the {{organization}} {{responsible for the}} production of Sesame Street, considered and discussed addressing the topic of divorce for many years before developing an episode. As early as 1989, writer and director Jon Stone expressed his intention of writing a script about it, stating, [...] "My two projects for this year are drugs and divorce. Divorce is a difficult one. Perhaps <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> with puppets. I am also writing a script on drugs and peer pressure". Executive producer Dulcy Singer vetoed the idea in 1990, before it reached development. While she felt complex social matters should be discussed on the series, she felt the issue was irrelevant to inner city and financially disadvantaged families, which was the show's target audience. She said that [...] "divorce is a middle-class thing," [...] and suggested instead that an episode focus on a single-parent family, with the child born out of wedlock with an absent father. Singer stated, even after the episode was filmed, [...] "We were really nervous about the show, and we didn't think it was a shoo-in. When you're dealing with something like death, the approach can be universal. But with divorce, it's so personal. People react differently." [...] The topic of divorce was discussed again the following year, after the US Census Bureau released statistics suggesting 40 percent of all children in the United States, not just the middle classes, would soon live in divorced households.|$|E
500|$|Spending {{their own}} money, N.E.R.D {{recorded}} the album at the South Beach Studios in Miami, Florida, and the Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles, California. Williams used a Triton Extreme, Triton Pro and Pro Tools {{in the production}} of the album, while Hugo worked in Access Virus TI, Roland JV-1080, JV-2080, XV-5080, TR-808 and TR-909 as beatboxing was provided by Haley. Rock band Spymob further assisted production with guitar and drums. Production revolved around heavy rock, funk and soul music, which was first introduced in their debut album, In Search Of.... Hugo described the album as going back to the band's roots, combining a classic rock sound with a 1970s funk swing. The typical process of recording was described as [...] "Williams arrives at the studio, ideas in full flower, and lays down both a beat (either programmed or played on an assortment of buckets) and vocals." [...] Hugo then would add extra instrumentation. In an interview with MTV, Williams said that the band [...] "didn't care about genres; we're not doing this for the money. We're doing this for people who pledge allegiance to our movement." [...] Hugo {{went on to say that}} they [...] "just want to make people move". On the album he said, [...] "We had anger, quiet angst. We had something to get off our chest. And we wanted to show <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> as a band." [...] Don Was, a musician and record producer, thought that the band was on a creatively fulfilling path, calling their musical style [...] "really innovative".|$|E
2500|$|More recent {{artistic and}} {{cinematic}} portrayals {{have also made}} an effort to characterize Jesus as an ancient Middle Eastern resident. In the 2004 movie, The Passion of the Christ, Jesus was portrayed by Jim Caviezel who wore a prosthetic nose during filming and had his blue eyes digitally changed to brown to give him a more Middle Eastern appearance. According to designer Miles Teves, who created the prosthesis: [...] "Mel (Gibson) wanted to make the actor playing Jesus, James Caviezel, look more ethnically Middle Eastern, and it was decided that <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> best by changing the shape of his nose." ...|$|E

2500|$|Initially called Panic, Black Flag {{was formed}} in 1976 in Hermosa Beach, California. Ginn insisted that the band rehearse several hours a day. This work ethic proved too {{challenging}} for some early members; Ginn and singer Keith Morris had an especially difficult time finding a reliable bass guitarist, and often rehearsed without a bassist, a factor {{that contributed to the}} development of Ginn's distinctive guitar sound. Ginn's brother Raymond Pettibon and SST house record producer-to-be Spot filled in during rehearsals. In the beginning, Ginn and Morris were inspired by the raw, stripped-down attitude of bands such as the Ramones and The Stooges. Ginn has said [...] "We were influenced by the Stooges and then the Ramones; they inspired us. Keith and myself saw the Ramones when they first toured LA in 1976. After we saw them, I said if they could do it <b>we</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> I thought Keith would be a good singer and after seeing the Ramones, it made him think that he doesn't have to be some classical operatic singer." ...|$|E
