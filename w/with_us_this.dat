Deirdre Cartwright joined the new band on lead guitar, Val Lloyd replaced Gayle on drums {{and they started}} playing the local pub scene. [...] "The reason we were all girls was we couldn’t find any blokes who wanted to play <b>with</b> <b>us!</b> <b>This</b> was the natural thing to do", McAuliffe explained to Gary Graff in 1997 about the all-female composition of the band.|$|E

In late March 1890, the Pittsburg Dispatch reported that the two sides had reached a resolution, [...] "and it now seems certain that Dunlap will play his old position in the Pittsburg league club." [...] Nimick said at the time: [...] "I had a long talk with Mr. Dunlap, and we agreed to terms for him to play <b>with</b> <b>us</b> <b>this</b> season. [...] Of course the terms were below those of last year, that is, he will play for much less than $5,000. [...] He did not sign a contract, for reasons that were quite satisfactory to me ... We know he is a good player and he is quite willing to remain with us." ...|$|E

Reyes, who had met Fazzi during Facing New York's stint on the 2004 Warped Tour, asked him by text whether he wanted to audition for Taking Back Sunday. In a statement, the group called Fazzi [...] "talented and versed in many musical instruments", mentioning that he would be [...] "bring his unique talent and style to the mix". Rubano was uneasy with Fazzi initially: [...] "He was this very nice, very talented, ambitious, happy guy, and I was like, 'This guy isn't going to last <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> <b>this</b> guy's the wrong fit.'" [...] Around this time, Fazzi and Rubano visited Lazzara in Texas; accompanied by acoustic guitars and a bass, the trio practiced in Lazzara's living room. Here, the trio wrote [...] "New Again" [...] which helped [...] "catapult the energy for the beginning of writing [...] forward," [...] according to Rubano. During an appearance at the Virgin Mobile Festival in August 2008, Spin reported that the band was on the brink of entering a recording studio.|$|E

500|$|Specimens of Lambertia formosa were {{collected}} by botanists Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander during Lieutenant James Cook's landing at Botany Bay between April and May in 1770. These {{are thought to have}} been obtained from vegetation currently known as the Eastern Suburbs Banksia Scrub that occurs in sandy areas near present-day La Perouse. The shrub was first described in 1798 by English botanist James Edward Smith who concurrently erected the new genus Lambertia, the name honouring English botanist Aylmer Bourke Lambert. The specific name formosa is the Latin adjective for 'handsome'. English plantsman Henry Charles Andrews wrote in 1799, [...] "Of all the plants yet introduced from New Holland, that have hitherto flowered <b>with</b> <b>us,</b> <b>this</b> unquestionably takes the lead for beauty, considering the plant altogether", although his countryman Joseph Knight in his 1809 work On the cultivation of the plants belonging to the natural order of Proteeae added that the species name [...] "applies only to the flowers, the foliage being generally of a sickly hue". French botanist Michel Gandoger described specimens collected at Hornsby and Port Jackson as Lambertia proxima, and material sent to him by plant collector Charles Walter as L. barbata [...] in 1919; these turned out to be L. formosa. Gandoger described 212 taxa of Australian plants, almost all of {{which turned out to be}} species already described.|$|E

In 2009, {{it was announced that}} Donna's father had been cast and would be introduced the following year. Brian Vriends was given the role of Nick Nixon.

Donna discovers that there are two men that could be her father and she contacts them both. Nick Nixon replies first and Donna begins to believe that he is her father. However, Professor Nicholas McKay (Chris Bunworth) later turns up and Donna becomes confused over the situation. Nicholas has just been released from jail and he is keen to do something right. However, he hurts Donna when he tells her that she is just like her mother and that she will run away. Robbie said [...] "He takes a horrible approach". Nicholas' arrival makes Donna more afraid to find out the results of the DNA test she asked Nick to take. On the situation, Robbie said [...] "She's a hopeless romantic and wants the happily ever after – not only with Ringo, but with her family." [...] The DNA test eventually proves that Nick is her real father.|$|E
