40|$|Classification of the causative agent Rinderpest {{is caused}} by a negative-strand RNA virus of the Morbillivirus genus within the family Paramyxoviridae. Three genetically {{distinct}} lineages (1 – 3) of the rinderpest virus (RPV) have been recognised as causal agents of disease in Africa and Asia. Resistance to physical and chemical action Temperature: Small amounts of virus resist 56 °C/ 60 minutes or 60 °C/ 30 minutes. pH: Stable between pH 4. 0 and 10. 0. Disinfectants/chemicals: Susceptible to lipid solvents and most common disinfectants (phenol, cresol, β-propiolactone, sodium hydroxide 2 %/ 24 hours used at a rate of 1 litre/m 2). Survival: Quickly inactivated in environment as RPV is sensitive to light, drying and ultraviolet radiation. Can remain viable for long periods in chilled or frozen tissues. EPIDEMIOLOGY In inmuno-naïve populations, rinderpest presents itself as an epidemic with high morbidity and mortality rates (up to 100 %). In these classic instances of disease, highly transmissible, virulent RPV strains dominate. In endemic areas, milder RPV strains have emerged and survivor host populations have adapted; disease is found principally in younger animals with waning maternal immunity. Domestic cattle {{play an important role in}} maintenance of RPV while in the <b>wild,</b> <b>African</b> <b>buffalo</b> seem to hold a central role though sylvatic survival of the virus is limited. Present day populations are too small to maintain the virus in the absence of infection in domestic species but are an indicator of infection in neighbouring cattle...|$|E

Firstly, to investigate {{the role of the}} <b>African</b> <b>buffalo</b> as a natural host species of BoHV- 4, the seroprevalence of anti-BoHV- 4 antibodies was analysed in <b>wild</b> <b>African</b> <b>buffaloes</b> throughout eastern and southern Africa.

There is no available vaccine against AlHV- 1. Several studies suggested that the <b>African</b> <b>buffalo</b> (Syncerus caffer) rather than cattle should be considered as the natural host species of bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV 4), an apathogenic gammaherpesvirus that is antigenically related to AlHV 1. Rossiter and co-workers (1989) suggested that an evolutionary relationship exists between AlHV 1 and BoHV 4. This hypothesis proposes that the serological antigenic relationship existing between BoHV 4 and AlHV 1 could confer to BoHV 4 infected buffaloes a protective immune response against lethal AlHV 1 infection. In this work, our goal was to generate information and tools that are required to test this hypothesis in the future. Our results are presented as three original studies: (i) Cloning of the alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 genome as an infectious and pathogenic bacterial artificial chromosome Journal of General Virology (2005), in press Dewals B., Boudry C., Gillet L, Markine-Goriaynoff N., de Leval L., Haig D. M. & Vanderplasschen A. Alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 (AlHV 1), carried by wildebeest asymptomatically, causes malignant catarrhal fever (MCF) when cross species transmitted to a variety of susceptible species of the Artiodactyla order. The study of MCF pathogenesis has been impeded by an inability to produce recombinant viruses, due mainly to the fact that AlHV 1 becomes attenuated during passage in culture. In this study, we have overcome these difficulties by cloning the entire AlHV 1 genome as a stable, infectious and pathogenic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). A modified loxP flanked BAC cassette was inserted in one of the two large non-coding regions of the AlHV 1 genome. This insertion allowed the production of an AlHV 1 BAC clone stably maintained in bacteria and able to regenerate virions when transfected into permissive cells. The loxP-flanked BAC cassette was excised from the genome of reconstituted virions by growing them in permissive cells stably expressing Cre recombinase. Importantly, BAC derived AlHV 1 virions replicated comparably to the virulent (low passage) AlHV 1 parental strain and induced MCF in rabbits that was indistinguishable from that of the virulent parental strain. The availability of the AlHV 1 BAC is an important advance for the study of MCF that will allow the identification of viral genes involved in MCF pathogenesis as well as the production of attenuated recombinant candidate vaccines.

(iii) Phylogenetic analysis of Bovine herpesvirus 4 strains isolated from cattle and from <b>African</b> <b>buffalo</b> In preparation Dewals B., Thirion M., Markine-Goriaynoff N., Gillet L., de Fays K., Minner F., Daix V., Sharp P. M. & Vanderplasschen A. Bovine herpesvirus 4 (BoHV 4) is a gammaherpesvirus which has been isolated from cattle throughout the world. Virological and serological studies have demonstrated that the <b>African</b> <b>buffalo</b> is also a natural host species of BoHV- 4. Interestingly, our phylogenetic study on the BoHV 4 Bo 17 gene revealed that this gene has been acquired from an ancestor of the <b>African</b> <b>buffalo</b> around 1. 5 million years ago. Study of the Bo 17 gene also suggested a relatively ancient transmission of BoHV- 4 from the ancestor of the <b>African</b> <b>buffalo</b> to the Bos primigenius lineage, followed by a host-dependent split between zebu and taurine BoHV- 4 strains. In the present study, we pursued our investigations on the evolution of BoHV 4. To investigate the phylogenetic relationship existing between BoHV 4 strains isolated from <b>African</b> <b>buffalo</b> in Kenya and from cattle throughout the world, nine strains representative of the BoHV 4 species were compared based on six different regions distributed across the genome. Our phylogenetic analyses led to the following conclusions: (i) BoHV 4 strains from <b>African</b> <b>buffalo</b> and from cattle form clades which have split approximately 700, 000 years ago. (ii) Since this divergence, inter clade and intra-clade recombination events occurred at different time in the past. (iii) the topology of the tree formed by zebu and taurine BoHV 4 strains is incompatible with a co-speciation process between BoHV 4 and domestic cattle implying that the latter have been contaminated through recent cross-species transmission. A scenario is proposed to explain how BoHV 4 has been transmitted from <b>African</b> <b>buffalo</b> to cattle and how the virus has reached a world wide distribution in the latter host species. In conclusion, this work generated key information and reagents to test in a near future the hypothesis proposed by Rossiter et al. (1989).

RBT and c-Elisa were used in serial for detection of antibodies against Brucella spp. Between July 2007 and October 2009, a total of 1, 158 cattle were tested and the overall seroprevalence of brucellosis was 9. 9 %. A total of 97 <b>wild</b> animals (<b>African</b> <b>buffaloes</b> (n= 47), impala (n= 33), kudu (n= 16), and giraffe (n= 1)) were tested and only one animal (giraffe) was seropositive for brucellosis (1. 03 %). Brucella seroprevalence showed an increasing trend with age, with adult cattle (> 6 years) recording the highest seroprevalence (11. 1 %), but the differences were not statistically significant. Similarly, female cattle recorded a relatively higher seroprevalence (10. 8 %) compared to males (7. 9 %), but the difference was not significant. However, a significant (P< 0. 001) association between Brucella seropositivity and abortion history was recorded in female cattle. Similarly, Brucella seropositivity was significantly (P< 0. 01) associated with a history of grazing in the park for female cattle. Overall, from the interface area, cattle with a history of grazing in the park recorded a significantly (P< 0. 01) higher Brucella seroprevalence (13. 5 %) compared to those with no history of grazing in the park (4. 9 %). The significant association between abortion history and seropositivity observed in this study illustrates the potential economic significance of Brucella in cattle in this area. Hence, public awareness and further epidemiological studies of the disease in wildlife, livestock, and humans in the study area are of great importance. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

We identifi ed 3, 000 putative SNPs by aligning the reads with the cattle genome (Bos taurus). Out of this set, an assay of 384 SNPs was designed taking care of each SNP's quality scores, minor allele frequencies, design scores and position in the genome. The use of those markers is completely innovative, as most of the time, they have only been developed on human model or domestic organisms. They are one of the most powerful tools and are becoming the marker of choice in genetic analyses. (Texte intégral...|$|R

Interest in reproduction in <b>African</b> <b>buffalo,</b> including the application of assisted reproductive technologies, has gained momentum in recent years, with the aim of finding an efficient way of a) increasing genetic diversity and b) producing “disease free” offspring of this wild ruminant species. In contrast to the many studies on placentation in domesticated bovids (cattle and water buffalo), the placenta of <b>African</b> <b>buffalo</b> has been almost completely neglected. A polycotyledonary, synepitheliochorial placenta, characterized by the development of numerous placentomes is generally described for members of the bovid family. Cattle placentomes are stalked, mushroom shaped and represent sites of anchorage and close contact between mother and foetus via interdigitation of foetal cotyledonary villi within corresponding caruncular crypts. Placentomes from 3 peri-partal, and foetal membranes from 7 post-partal <b>African</b> <b>buffalo</b> cows were collected and placentomal and cotyledonary samples prepared for light microscopy (LM), scanningand transmission Electron Microscopy (SEM, TEM). The morphology and villous-crypt architecture of buffalo placentomes as well as the histology and ultrastructure of their structural components were described. Complete foetal membranes were macroscopically examined and cotyledonary villi were studied by SEM. A comparison with cattle placentomes and foetal membranes was performed directly or via comparison with relevant descriptions available in the literature. Comparison between buffalo and cattle placentae revealed that distribution pattern and placentome size were similar in both genera but that buffalo displayed considerably more placentomes than cattle. Buffalo placentomes were, in contrast to those of cattle, non-stalked. Differences in foetal villousity included long, slender and moderately branched villi in buffalo compared to broad, conical and complexly branched villi in cattle. Comparable cell types were involved in the synepitheliochorial interhaemal placental barrier in both genera but histological evidence for the process of placental maturation seems to be less pronounced in the buffalo than in the cattle placenta. The simpler villi in the non-stalked placentomes of the <b>African</b> <b>buffalo</b> form less complex fetomaternal interdigitations, which is interpreted as providing a somewhat less efficient nutrient supply to the developing foetus. This might partly explain the longer gestation period in buffalo compared to cattle. The placenta of water buffalo also contains non-stalked placentomes, thus resembling the <b>African</b> <b>buffalo</b> placenta in this respect, indicating a closer phylogenetic relationship between the two buffalo genera than between buffalo and cattle. Results of this first study of placentomes and foetal membranes of <b>African</b> <b>buffalo</b> fills large gaps existing in ruminant placentation and may provide the basis for further research in buffalo reproduction. The similarity in placental morphology between the <b>African</b> <b>buffalo</b> and water buffalo may enhance future trials of intergeneric embryo transfer between the two buffalo genera.

Natural and experimental infections related to RVFV in several mammalian orders, including Artiodactyla, Chiroptera, Rodentia, Primata (nonhuman), Perissodactyla, Carnivora, Proboscidea, Erinaceomorpha, and Lagomorpha, are reviewed; the first four orders have received the greatest attention. The possible role of <b>wild</b> ruminants, especially <b>African</b> <b>buffalo</b> (Syncerus caffer), is also discussed.

We are unaware of any investigation concerning the orders Afrosoricida and Soricomorpha, which are represented in the geographic area of RVFV and can be abundant. As a first step to resolve the question of wild mammals as a reservoir of RVFV, serologic and virologic surveys should be promoted during epizootic periods to document infected wild animals and, in the case of positive results, extended to interepidemic periods to explore the role of wild animals as possible reservoirs...|$|R
