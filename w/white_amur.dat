50|$|The {{lake was}} stocked in 1967 with Muskellunge, Largemouth bass, Bluegill, and Channel Catfish. At present {{there are also}} Black Crappie, Brown Bullheads, Pumpkinseeds and other {{varieties}} of Sunfish. In about 2000 American Gizzard Shad appeared in the lake. Because of feeding patterns this resulted in Bass getting bigger and Bluegills getting smaller. <b>White</b> <b>Amurs</b> (Grass Carp) have been introduced to control weeds and they have remove weed beds which were good places to fish for Bass.|$|R

The park contains a tennis court, two basketball courts, playground equipment, spring toys, and swing set. The park also has a shelter house with picnic tables and grills. There is a small paved walking path and benches in the park as well as paved parking area.Dixon Quarry includes a six-acre lake for recreational fishing, an archery range, walking paths, park shelters, fitness trails, and a bike path that connects to the Alum Creek Greenway/Olentangy-Scioto Bike Trail that runs all through central Ohio.

50|$|Silver Lake has an {{irregular}} arch shape, it is 14 km long, up to 300 m wide and covers {{an area of}} 4 km2. It is situated at the altitude of 70 m and deep as much as 8 m. The water is clear {{due to the lack}} of pollution and the natural filtration of the water through many sand dunes. The lake is abundant in fish, including <b>white</b> <b>amur,</b> carp, catfish, northern pike, perch and other freshwater whitefish.|$|E

It {{should be noted that}} the Lika river abounds in fish resources, as well as the accumulation lake Kruscica (created in 1971, it is suitable for water sports and swimming in calm waters). The variety of wildlife includes catfish and carp also: pike, chub, crvenorepke, <b>white</b> <b>amur,</b> sunstroke, and babushkas.|$|E
50|$|In past years, Rainbow Lake {{has also}} had a {{significant}} problem with invasive aquatic weeds, particularly the Eurasian watermilfoil, Myriophyllum spicatum. Efforts by the local volunteer group Show Low Creek Watershed Enhancement Partnership (SLCWEP), {{in conjunction with the}} Little Colorado River Plateau Resource Conservation and Development Area, Inc., resulted in a systemic herbicide treatment of the lake in the summer and fall of 2011. The results were not as good as hoped, with the equally problematic coontail weed rapidly replacing the watermilfoil in the lake. Long-term efforts by the Rainbow Lake Coalition (a subcommittee of the SLCWEP) are now focused on the introduction of sterile <b>white</b> <b>Amur</b> carp, which have been proven to control excessive growth of watermilfoil for up to 10 years. Arizona Game and Fish requires mediation to ensure that the carp, a non-native fish, are prevented from escaping Rainbow Lake and potentially invading other water bodies. The Rainbow Lake Coalition is now working to design and construct a fish barrier on Walnut Creek below Lake of the Woods, which has used the carp for weed control for many years.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: "Fish, {{waterfowl}} and wading birds, {{and aquatic}} mammal populations on Lake Conway were surveyed for 1 {{year after the}} introduction of the herbivorous fish, <b>white</b> <b>amur</b> (Ctenopharyngodon idella). Low water levels reduced littoral zone area, which lead to stunted panfish and poorer condition of largemouth bass. Vegetated samples supported more diverse fish populations than beach sites. <b>White</b> <b>amur</b> and migratory waterfowl consumed the same plant foods; continued reduction of submerged plants by <b>white</b> <b>amur</b> may adversely affect overwintering waterfowl populations. Aquatic mammals were influenced by removal of vegetation due to shoreline development. ...|$|E

Three of these five species had no previous LWR estimates in the FishBase.
