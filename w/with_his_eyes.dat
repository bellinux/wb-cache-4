5|$|Little {{was one of}} the {{earliest}} and most successful practitioners of market manipulation, making his fortune by leveraging both short sales and short sellers. In the former, he would sell stocks to other traders under contract to purchase it at a later date, betting that the market value would go down in the future and he could pocket the difference (trade rules have changed, and short selling is more complicated than this today). In the latter he would execute the opposite maneuver, corner a market by buying up all of the bonds of a particular company or sector, up-ticking the price so as to make a profit at the expense of any short sales based on those stocks. Hardworking, highly ambitious, and <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> set on the very top from the very beginning, Little commonly spent twelve hours a day working on such maneuvers in his office and a further six during the evening engaged in currency speculation.|$|E
5|$|The visual {{is almost}} {{six and a}} half minutes long. As the video begins, waves are seen {{crashing}} on a night time beach. Nearly a minute later, Beyoncé appears; she is strolling on a beach at night and she seemingly carries a massive trophy while an eerie music is playing in the background. Sporting a sheer negligee that reveals her bra and panties beneath, she twists her body in the sand. The singer also dances seductively against a backdrop of smoke and mouths the song's lyrics, staring at the camera. Beyoncé is later joined by husband Jay-Z, who is wearing a T-shirt and a backwards baseball cap. He raps <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> down holding a glass with alcohol in his hand while Beyoncé mouths the words behind him, smiling. The last seconds of the video show Beyoncé dancing and it concludes with close-up shots of the singer's face.|$|E
5|$|Tulsidas {{hints at}} several places in his works, {{that he had}} met {{face to face with}} Hanuman and Rama. The {{detailed}} account of his meetings with Hanuman and Rama are given in the Bhaktirasbodhini of Priyadas. According to Priyadas' account, Tulsidas used to visit the woods outside Varanasi for his morning ablutions with a water pot. On his return to the city, he used to offer the remaining water to a certain tree. This quenched the thirst of a Preta (a type of ghost believed to be ever thirsty for water), who appeared to Tulsidas and offered him a boon. Tulsidas said he wished to see Rama <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> to which the Preta responded that it was beyond him. However, the Preta said that he could guide Tulsidas to Hanuman, who could grant the boon Tulsidas asked for. The Preta told Tulsidas that Hanuman comes everyday disguised in the mean attire of a leper to listen to his Katha, he is the first to arrive and last to leave.|$|E

25|$|Sturt {{returned}} to Adelaide with his family, arriving back in August 1849. He was immediately appointed Colonial Secretary {{with a seat}} in the council. There was no lack of work in the ensuing years. Roads were constructed, and navigation on the Murray was encouraged. But Sturt had renewed trouble <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes.</b>|$|E

25|$|Soon after World War II, {{problems}} <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> {{which had}} begun in 1941-2 led to Mead becoming totally blind, but he never complained about this. His financial worries were assuaged by a fund raised by Herbert Sutcliffe for Mead and Len Braund. He retained {{a great interest in}} cricket and often attended Hampshire matches at Dean Park right up to his death on 26 March 1958.|$|E

25|$|On September 17, 2012, a {{man from}} the Republic of Kiribati was rescued after being at sea for 105 days. The man said that a shark swam around the boat and took it off in a direction.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1880s Cross began to {{experience}} trouble <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes,</b> which grew more severe in the 1900s. He also increasingly suffered from arthritis. At {{least in part}} due to these health issues that plagued him for years, Cross's body of work is relatively small. However, in his last years he was productive and very creative, and his work was featured in significant solo exhibitions; he received great acclaim from critics and enjoyed commercial success.|$|E
25|$|July 5: Jeremiah Weinberger, 23. Met Dahmer at a gay bar in Chicago {{and agreed}} to {{accompany}} him to Milwaukee for the weekend. Dahmer drilled through Weinberger's skull and injected boiling water into the cavity. He later recalled Weinberger's death to be exceptional, as {{he was the only}} victim who died <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> open. Weinberger's decapitated body was kept in the bathtub for a week before being dismembered; his torso was placed in the 57-gallon drum.|$|E

25|$|In April 1903 an {{operation}} {{was performed by}} Sherren to divide two cutaneous nerves in Head's left forearm: the radial and the external. The regeneration of these nerves was charted {{over the next four}} years. Every Friday, Head would travel to Rivers' rooms in St John's College, Cambridge to conduct the experiments. It had soon become obvious that external distractions had an adverse effect on results and so Head sat every weekend <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> closed as Rivers charted the areas of sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|A {{photograph}} was taken of Richmond captain-coach Dyer, aged 30 and playing his {{two hundred and}} twenty second game, wearing white strapping on his left thumb, and a dirty knee bandage on his left knee, breaking away from the pack, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> fixed on the Lake end goals (Dyer went on to kick a goal), {{in the last quarter}} of the 1944 Preliminary Final, held at the Junction Oval, on Saturday 23 September 1944, in which Richmond defeated Essendon, primarily due to Dyer's nine goals.|$|E
25|$|From 1978 to {{his death}} Cage worked at Crown Point Press, {{producing}} series of prints every year. The earliest project completed there was the etching Score Without Parts (1978), created from fully notated instructions, and based on various combinations of drawings by Henry David Thoreau. This was followed, the same year, by Seven Day Diary, which Cage drew <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> closed, but which conformed to a strict structure developed using chance operations. Finally, Thoreau's drawings informed the last works produced in 1978, Signals.|$|E

25|$|In Brazil, Räikkönen {{qualified}} 5th {{and finished}} 6th. His race was already ruined when Mark Webber swerved into his path, damaging the Ferrari's front wing. At the pit stop while having the wing changed, fuel dripping from the fuel rig stuck on Kovalainen's car caused the Ferrari to briefly burst in flames {{as the two}} cars were exiting their pit stops. For {{the rest of the}} race even <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> burning from fuel, Räikkönen used his strategy to move up the order and eventually finished in sixth place.|$|E
25|$|In {{nearly every}} story, Wolfe solves the mystery by {{considering}} the facts brought to him by Archie and others, and the replies to questions he himself asks of suspects. Wolfe ponders <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> closed, {{leaning back in his}} chair, breathing deeply and steadily, and pushing his lips in and out. Archie says that during these trances Wolfe reacts to nothing that is going on around him. Archie seldom interrupts Wolfe's thought processes, he says, largely because it is the only time that he can be sure that Wolfe is working.|$|E
25|$|Socrates' {{idea that}} reality is {{unavailable}} {{to those who}} use their senses is what puts him {{at odds with the}} common man, and with common sense. Socrates says that he who sees <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> is blind, and this idea is most famously captured in his Allegory of the Cave, and more explicitly in his description of the divided line. The Allegory of the Cave (begins Republic 7.514a) is a paradoxical analogy wherein Socrates argues that the invisible world is the most intelligible ("noeton") and that the visible world ("(h)oraton") is the least knowable, and the most obscure.|$|E

25|$|On April 20, 1985, {{acting on}} a tip-off from a student, the ALF raided a {{laboratory}} in the University of California, Riverside, causing $700,000 in damages and removing 468 animals. These included Britches, a five-week-old macaque, who had been separated from his mother at birth and left alone <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> sewn shut and a sonar device on his head {{as part of a}} study into blindness. The raid, which was taped by the ALF, eight of the laboratory's seventeen active research projects were shut down, and the university said years of medical research were lost. The raid prompted National Institutes of Health director James Wyngaarden to argue that the raids should be regarded as acts of terrorism.|$|E
25|$|On 2 August, Chikatilo {{killed a}} 16-year-old girl, Natalya Golosovskaya, in Aviators' Park. On 7 August, he lured a 17-year-old girl, Lyudmila Alekseyeva, {{to the banks}} of the Don River on the pretense of showing her a {{shortcut}} to a bus terminal. Alekseyeva suffered 39 slash wounds to her body before Chikatilo mutilated and disemboweled her: intentionally inflicting wounds he knew would not be immediately fatal. Her body was found in the following morning, her excised upper lip inside her mouth. Hours after Alekseyeva's murder, Chikatilo flew to the Uzbekistan capital of Tashkent on a business trip. By the time he had returned to Rostov on 15 August, he had killed an unidentified young woman and a 10-year-old girl. Within two weeks an 11-year-old boy had been found strangled and castrated, <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> gouged out, in Rostov before a young librarian, Irina Luchinskaya, was killed in Aviators' Park on 6 September.|$|E
25|$|Stevens {{was born}} November 18, 1923, in Indianapolis, Indiana, {{the third of}} four children, in a small cottage built by his {{paternal}} grandfather after the marriage of his parents, Gertrude S. (née Chancellor) and George A. Stevens. The family later lived in Chicago, where George Stevens was an accountant before losing his job during the Great Depression. Around this time, when Ted Stevens was six years old, his parents divorced, and Stevens and his three siblings went back to Indianapolis to reside with their paternal grandparents, followed shortly thereafter by their father, who developed problems <b>with</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and went blind for several years. Stevens's mother moved to California and sent for Stevens's siblings as she could afford to, but Stevens stayed in Indianapolis helping to care for his father and a mentally disabled cousin, Patricia Acker, who also lived with the family. The only adult in the household with a job was Stevens's grandfather. Stevens helped to support the family by working as a newsboy, and would later remember selling many newspapers on March 1, 1932, when newspaper headlines blared {{the news of the}} Lindbergh kidnapping.|$|E
