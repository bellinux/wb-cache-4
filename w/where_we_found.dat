25|$|We {{stayed to}} the {{so-called}} Saint-Pierre islands <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> several French and Breton ships, from St. Barnabe's day, 11 June, until 16th day of said month.|$|E
2500|$|... “We {{were talking}} about how afraid our church members are today. A look at your {{finances}} right now might mean kids who wanted to go to college can't, and so on. The fear that brings can be paralyzing... But then we asked ourselves, Shouldn't believers who have the heart of eternity in them be different? That's <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> our theme; fear less, hope more.” ...|$|E
2500|$|As in 2012, PickupTrucks.com {{performed}} another mid-size truck challenge {{but with}} 2016 and 2017 model year vehicles {{sold in the}} U.S. [...] Through a battery of objective and subjective test —many similar and some different from the 2012 challenge— the 2017 Ridgeline came in second overall [...] "by one of the slimmest margins in any test" [...] PickupTrucks.com has conducted, winning half of the objective tests. [...] PickupTrucks.com said, [...] "There's no question the Ridgeline was the surprise of this challenge... Our biggest surprise came at our daylong romp at the Bundy Hill Offroad Park <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> the Honda Intelligent Traction Management system to be shrewd and smooth during our sand drags and steep hill climbs. [...] However, {{as well as it}} performed, it still had a few problems;" [...] such as how [...] "much sag occurs while carrying payload," [...] mushy and unpredictable brakes, and a hard to use with bad Sun glare infotainment touchscreen. [...] "Still, if you need your pickup to be a Swiss Army knife and you don't need to carry a lot of gear, there isn't anything else in the Ridgeline's league." ...|$|E
60|$|But <b>we</b> <b>found</b> {{afterwards}} that <b>we</b> {{need not}} take such pains for water, {{for a little}} higher up the creek <b>where</b> <b>we</b> were <b>we</b> <b>found</b> the water fresh when the tide was out, which flowed but a little way up; so we filled our jars, and feasted on the hare he had killed, and prepared to go on our way, having seen no footsteps of any human creature {{in that part of}} the country.|$|R
60|$|I {{remember}} that Breed gave a wink, {{and led me}} out of the window onto a gallery above the one <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had <b>found</b> the master the night before. He pointed across the dense foliage of the garden to a strip of water gleaming in the morning sun beyond.|$|R
60|$|And {{without another}} word he lifted his spear in salutation, and {{returned}} towards the camp, <b>where</b> shortly afterwards <b>we</b> <b>found</b> him cleaning a gun like any other Kafir.|$|R
60|$|We {{ascended to}} Mr. Trelawny's room, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> {{everything}} exactly as his daughter had described.|$|E
60|$|In {{due course}} {{we arrived at}} the gate of the kraal, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> the heralds and the praisers prancing and shouting.|$|E
6000|$|So we rode back to {{her little}} cottage at Highgate, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> the {{following}} short note, which had arrived by that morning's post from Mr. Micawber: ...|$|E
5|$|We {{marched to}} the place <b>we</b> called Cornhill, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had <b>found</b> the corn before. At another place we had seen before, <b>we</b> dug and <b>found</b> some more corn, two or three baskets full, {{and a bag of}} beans....In all we had about ten bushels, which will be enough for seed. It is with God's help that <b>we</b> <b>found</b> this corn, for how else could we have done it, without meeting some Indians who might trouble us.|$|R
60|$|Darkness {{had already}} come on, and the coolies being far behind, we encamped {{by the light}} of the moon, shining through a thin fog, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> first <b>found</b> dwarf-juniper for fuel, at 13,500 feet. A little sleet fell during the night, which was tolerably fine, and not very cold; the minimum {{thermometer}} indicating 14.5 degrees.|$|R
30|$|The {{answers to}} all but one {{question}} depended on demographic factors, such as on chemical knowledge, education, age, or other parameters as described in the “Results” section. This coincided with our previous results [10], <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had <b>found</b> substantial differences between the answers given by various demographic groups and had concluded that differences between individuals must be taken seriously.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{have to go}} back to <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> the two trails {{crossed and}} then try the other one. I don't know of {{anything}} else to do." ...|$|E
60|$|In a {{few moments}} Phil Jones and I had on our clothing, and both of us {{stepped out into the}} cabin, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> Mr. Ranson {{awaiting}} us.|$|E
60|$|This sort of {{conversation}} brought us, {{in the highest}} good-humour with each other, to Osbaldistone Hall, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> the family far advanced in the revels of the evening.|$|E
40|$|We test our {{approach}} on the HapMap cohort <b>where</b> <b>we</b> rediscovered previously <b>found</b> CNVs which validates {{our approach}}. It is then tested on the tumor genome data set <b>where</b> <b>we</b> {{are able to}} considerably increase the detection while reducing the false discoveries. |$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has shot}} {{himself through the}} head. <b>Where</b> d'ye think <b>we</b> <b>found</b> him? Slap in the middle o' his own claim, with his fingers dug into the gravel, as dead as a herring." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mathias, {{the high}} priest," [...] said the captain; [...] "that is another matter. Well, this Mathias let {{us into the}} city, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> have <b>found</b> good quarters, and good plunder; so as one turn deserves another, we may as well let in his friends. Pass, cousin of Mathias the high priest, with all your company," [...] and he opened the gate.|$|R
60|$|Our guide carried us to Amiens, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> {{the express}} and our two servants, who the express {{meeting on the}} road with a spare horse, had brought back with him thither.|$|E
60|$|Some half-hour {{later we}} came to the pits beneath our own palace, and soon {{thereafter}} emerged into the audience chamber itself, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> Kantos Kan, Tars Tarkas, Hor Vastus, and Xodar awaiting us most impatiently.|$|E
60|$|I held my peace, {{angry and}} timorous, {{until we were}} come to the water front, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> Darius {{awaiting}} us, and he, as could be seen at a glance, was of the same mind as Jerry.|$|E
60|$|At the inn at Bologna <b>where</b> <b>we</b> dismounted, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> old Falcone {{awaiting}} us. He had set {{out with}} his master to ride to Rome. But being himself saddle-worn at the time, he {{had been unable to}} proceed farther than this, and here Galeotto in his fierce impatience had left him, pursuing his way alone.|$|R
40|$|A {{microwave}} radar technique for remotely measuring the vector wave number {{spectrum of the}} ocean surface is described. The technique which employs short-pulse, noncoherent radars in a conical scan mode near vertical incidence, is shown to be suitable for both aircraft and satellite application, the technique was validated at 10 km aircraft altitude, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> have <b>found</b> excellent agreement between buoy and radar-inferred absolute wave height spectra...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} the redmonster automated redshift measurement and spectral classification software {{designed for the}} extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV). We {{describe the}} algorithms, the template standard and requirements, and the newly developed galaxy templates to be used on eBOSS spectra. We present results from testing on early data from eBOSS, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> have <b>found</b> a 90. 5...|$|R
60|$|On she led us, {{straight}} {{to the top of}} the vast and silent cave, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> another doorway, not arched as the first was, but square at the top, something like the doorways of Egyptian temples.|$|E
60|$|Taking the {{antelope}} with us, we all {{returned to the}} launch, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> Taylor as delighted to see me alive again as Delcarte had been. I cannot say truthfully that Snider evinced much enthusiasm at my rescue.|$|E
60|$|After a moment's hesitation, he {{replaced}} {{it in the}} chest, heaped {{all the other things}} on top of it as before, and made his way briskly downstairs. He went straight to the pantry, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> Dorcas busily polishing her silver.|$|E
60|$|So we {{went past}} {{the image of}} Fate, out of the temple, down the vast and lonely streets so unnaturally illuminated, to the place <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had first <b>found</b> {{ourselves}} on arrival in the depths. There we stood.|$|R
60|$|I {{followed}} the candle down, as I had {{followed the}} candle up, and she stood it in the place <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had <b>found</b> it. Until she opened the side entrance, I had fancied, without thinking about it, that it must necessarily be night-time. The rush of the daylight quite confounded me, and made me feel as if I {{had been in the}} candlelight of the strange room many hours.|$|R
60|$|We took up at a rural bar-room, {{after we}} had gone a few miles, an {{intoxicated}} gentleman who climbed upon the roof among the luggage, and subsequently slipping off without hurting himself, {{was seen in the}} distant perspective reeling back to the grog-shop <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had <b>found</b> him. <b>We</b> also parted with more of our freight at different times, so that when we came to change horses, I was again alone outside.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} we came into the creek's mouth, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> six to eight fathom water within a cable's length of the shore, and found fresh water enough, but no people or cattle, though an {{excellent}} country for both.|$|E
60|$|Having left Lestrade at his rooms, {{we drove}} to our hotel, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> lunch upon the table. Holmes was silent and buried in thought with a pained {{expression}} upon his face, as one who finds himself in a perplexing position.|$|E
6000|$|... "There was a {{policeman}} {{within a few}} yards of the spot, sir," [...] he replied. [...] "He's gone down to keep every one away from the place <b>where</b> <b>we</b> <b>found</b> the body. We've telephoned to Scotland Yard for an inspector." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the first}} episode, [...] "Ride", Endeavour's friend is Anthony Donn from the Morse episode [...] "Deceived by Flight". Morse and Anthony Donn lived {{together}} {{in college and}} shared a flat in St John's Wood. Bruce Belborough calls Endeavour Pagan referencing [...] "Deceived by Flight" [...] <b>where</b> <b>we</b> first <b>found</b> out Morse was called Pagan by Roland Marshall. There is also a brief reference to Julius Hanbury, a murder victim in [...] "Ghost in the Machine." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Where's</b> Everybody (<b>WE)</b> was <b>founded</b> in 1999 as a TV {{production}} company, {{a partnership}} between Peppi Azzopardi, Lou Bondi and PJ Vassallo Mintoff. Individually, the first two currently host the two current affairs and discussion programmes in Malta namely Xarabank and Bondiplus respectively.|$|R
60|$|In {{the first}} place, I took the two shallops and {{went across the}} mouth of the great river to the south shore, {{to see what kind of}} a country was to be found there. For, as to the north side, <b>where</b> <b>we</b> were, <b>we</b> <b>found</b> it to be much the same with that part <b>where</b> <b>we</b> had been before; with this {{difference}} only, whereas, in the other place gold was to be had in plenty, but here was none we could find; nor did we perceive that the people had any.|$|R
