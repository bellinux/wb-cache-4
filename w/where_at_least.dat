5|$|Suicide {{rates in}} Germany {{increased}} {{as the war}} drew to a close, particularly {{in areas where the}} Red Army was advancing. More than a thousand people (out of a population of around 16,000) committed suicide in Demmin on and around 1 May 1945 as the 65th Army of 2nd Belorussian Front first broke into a distillery and then rampaged through the town, committing mass rapes, arbitrarily executing civilians and setting fire to buildings. High numbers of suicides took place in many other locations, including Neubrandenburg (600 dead), Stolp in Pommern (1,000 dead) and Berlin, <b>where</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 7,057 people committed suicide in 1945.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Abe killed 108–195people {{after it}} caused {{flooding}} and landslides in the Philippines and Taiwan, ravaged coastal areas of China, and brought high waves to Japan. Abe, {{which is responsible}} for killing 108 in China, affected half of Zhejiang's land area and a fourth of its population, leaving thousands homeless and causing ¥3.5billion yuan (RMB, $741.5–743million USD) to be lost in damages. Additional damage and one fatality occurred in Okinawa Prefecture in Japan, <b>where</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> ¥890million yen (JPY, $6million USD) in damage was caused.|$|E
5|$|Although Bolaven {{struck the}} Ryukyu Islands as a {{powerful}} typhoon, damage was less than expected. Relatively few buildings were damaged or destroyed across the region. The most significant effects stemmed from heavy rains, amounting to , that caused flash flooding and landslides. One person drowned on Amami Ōshima after being swept away by a swollen river. In mainland Japan, two people drowned after being swept away by rough seas. In South Korea, 19 people {{were killed by the}} storm. Many buildings were damaged and approximately 1.9million homes were left without power. Losses in the country reached ₩420billion (US$374.3million), the majority of which was due to destroyed apple orchards. Significant damage also took place in North Korea <b>where</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 59 people were killed and 50 others were reported missing. Additionally, 6,700 homes were destroyed. Offshore, nine people drowned after two Chinese vessels sank.|$|E
5|$|Hippeastrum {{species are}} {{concentrated}} in two centres of diversity, the main one in Eastern Brazil {{and the other in}} the central southern Andes of Peru, Bolivia and Argentina, on the eastern slopes and nearby foothills. Some species are found as far north as Mexico and the West Indies. The genus is thought to have originated in Brazil <b>where</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 34 of the species have been found. Their habitat is mainly tropical and subtropical, though those species found south of the equator, or at sufficient altitude may be considered temperate. Hippeastrum is found {{in a wide range of}} habitats. Many are found in underbrush, while others prefer full sun. Hippeastrum angustifolium is an example of a species preferring flood areas, while other species prefer a drier habitat. There are also epiphytic species such as Hippeastrum aulicum, Hippeastrum calyptratum, Hippeastrum papilio and Hippeastrum arboricola, which require air circulation around their roots, which are in the subgenus Omphalissa.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{following}} the storm, urgent requests {{for food and}} clean water were made by residents in the hardest hit areas. By the afternoon of October23, the Red Cross began deploying relief supplies to the affected region; 300 tents and 150 bags of rice were planned to be distributed to Kyaukphyu <b>where</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 5,000 people were left homeless. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), a total of 176,823 people were affected by the storm and 70,795 were left homeless. By October30, the number affected and homeless had risen to 1.1million and roughly 100,000 respectively. Red Cross officials also reported that an estimated 60,000 people were in need of assistance throughout Myanmar. Later that day, a relief charity was opened in Rangoon to aid victims of the storm; in short order, the charity had received donations of 10million kyat ($10,000USD). By October25, temporary shelter camps set up by relief agencies housed an estimated 5,000 people.|$|E
5|$|In May 2017, the WannaCry {{ransomware}} attack {{spread through}} the Internet, using an exploit vector named EternalBlue, which was leaked from the U.S. National Security Agency. The ransomware attack, unprecedented in scale, infected more than 230,000 computers in over 150 countries, using 20 different languages to demand money from users using Bitcoin cryptocurrency. WannaCrypt demanded US$300 per computer. The attack affected Telefónica and several other large companies in Spain, as well as parts of the British National Health Service (NHS), <b>where</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 16 hospitals had to turn away patients or cancel scheduled operations, FedEx, Deutsche Bahn, Honda, Renault, {{as well as the}} Russian Interior Ministry and Russian telecom MegaFon. The attackers gave their victims a 7-day deadline from the day their computers got infected, after which the encrypted files would be deleted.|$|E
5|$|Spawning is {{generally}} driven by environmental {{factors such as}} changes in the water temperature, and their release is triggered by lighting conditions such as sunrise, sunset or the phase of the moon. Many species of Cnidaria may spawn simultaneously in the same location, {{so that there are}} too many ova and sperm for predators to eat more than a tiny percentage— one famous example is the Great Barrier Reef, <b>where</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 110 corals and a few non-cnidarian invertebrates produce enough gametes to turn the water cloudy. These mass spawnings may produce hybrids, some of which can settle and form polyps, but it is not known how long these can survive. In some species the ova release chemicals that attract sperm of the same species.|$|E

5|$|Structural {{alignment}} {{attempts to}} establish homology between {{two or more}} polymer structures based on their shape and three-dimensional conformation. This process is usually applied to protein tertiary structures but {{can also be used}} for large RNA molecules. In contrast to simple structural superposition, <b>where</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> some equivalent residues of the two structures are known, structural alignment requires no a priori knowledge of equivalent positions. Structural alignment is a valuable tool for the comparison of proteins with low sequence similarity, where evolutionary relationships between proteins cannot be easily detected by standard sequence alignment techniques. Structural alignment can therefore be used to imply evolutionary relationships between proteins that share very little common sequence. However, caution should be used in using the results as evidence for shared evolutionary ancestry because of the possible confounding effects of convergent evolution by which multiple unrelated amino acid sequences converge on a common tertiary structure.|$|E
5|$|The areas NY3 {{passes through}} {{alternate}} between {{long stretches of}} rural area, consisting of a mix of open terrain and dispersed residences, and compact settlements containing concentrations of houses and businesses. NY3 is classified mainly as a minor arterial road, the major exception being the section that is concurrent with NY812, which is a principal arterial road. Most of the route is maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation. Exceptions are in the cities of Watertown and Plattsburgh, <b>where</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> part of the road is city-maintained.

5|$|The {{effects of}} the {{hurricane}} were most severe on the Florida East Coast Railway, <b>where</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> 135 people died, 104 of them on Houseboat No. 4, one of the railway's boats. Many of the workers were swept to sea on barges and flatboats; however, the steamer Jenny rescued 42 workers, who were dropped off at Key West, while another 24 were sent to Savannah, Georgia. The railway's losses totaled about $200,000. Construction was disrupted {{for a whole year}} by the storm, as equipment was reassembled and repaired. Many farmers on the Florida Keys suffered large losses; orange groves and fields of pineapples were devastated by the storm. Six lives were lost on plantations in the Keys. At the government wharf, the Fessenden was damaged during the hurricane.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Cimaron {{struck the}} Philippines with winds {{estimated}} at 195km/h (120mph) and gusts {{in excess of}} 230km/h (145mph). Along coastal Aurora Province, a mother and daughter were killed when strong winds destroyed their home. Numerous trees and power lines were felled by the winds as well, causing widespread blackouts in Luzon. The majority of Aurora and Isabela provinces were left without power and telecommunications {{for more than two}} weeks. Approximately 90percent of the homes in Dinapigue were damaged. Heavy rains across the region swelled many rivers, flooding low-lying areas along their banks. Several bridges became impassable and officials had to release water from two major dams to prevent them from overflowing. The most significant flooding occurred along the Allied-Sinocalan and Tagamusing rivers in Pangasinan. Low-lying areas along the Cagayan, Chico, Magat, Pinacanauan, Tuguegarao Pared rivers throughout Cagayan province were also affected by flooding. Numerous roads were blocked off by landslides or washed away by flooding, severely limiting travel. A landslide temporarily isolated four barangays in Nueva Vizcaya. A Provincial Disaster Coordinating Council search and rescue team was later deployed to Kasibu <b>where</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> four people were killed by flooding. Fatal landslides took place in Benguet and Kalinga provinces. A traffic accident blamed on the storm in La Union resulted in one death and seven injuries.|$|E
