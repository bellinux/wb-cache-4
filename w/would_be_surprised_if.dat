In an interview director Todd Phillips revealed that Mike Tyson would be back in the sequel. Also in November, it {{was reported}} that Paul Giamatti had joined the cast. The next day {{it was reported}} that former U.S. President Bill Clinton filmed a cameo appearance for the film in Bangkok {{while he was in the}} city to deliver a speech on clean energy. Ed Helms clarified that Clinton merely visited the set and <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> he appeared in the film.|$|E

500|$|Four {{days after}} Kesler's return, Jannik Hansen was {{involved}} in a controversial hit on the Chicago Blackhawks' Marian Hossa. As both players went up for an airborne puck, Hansen struck Hossa {{in the back of the}} head with his forearm and elbow. Hossa then laid on the ice for a few minutes, during which time the training staff examined him before he was able to leave under his own power. Hansen was given a two-minute minor for roughing and Hossa did not return to the game. Opinions of the hit varied with former NHL referee Kerry Fraser, stating that he did not believe that there was any deliberate or malicious intent, and that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> Hansen received a suspension for the play. Meanwhile, former Blackhawks analyst Ed Olczyk stated, [...] "there’s no doubt in my mind, once he didn’t play the puck, he had one thing in his mind, and that was to put his forearm or elbow in the back of the head of Marian Hossa," [...] and he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> Hansen was not suspended. Hossa returned to practice the following day. Hansen was suspended for one game due to what Brendan Shanahan called [...] "the carelessness and force of which the blow was delivered." ...|$|E

500|$|Taylor {{made his}} NFL regular season debut on September 6, 1981, in a 24–10 {{loss to the}} Philadelphia Eagles. Aside from {{incurring}} a penalty for a late hit on Eagles running back Perry Harrington, Taylor played a nondescript game. In a game versus the St. Louis Cardinals later in the season, Taylor rushed and sacked the passer when {{he was supposed to}} drop into coverage. When told by Parcells that was not what he was assigned to do on that play, and that what he did was not in the playbook, Taylor responded [...] "Well, we better put it in on Monday, because that play's a dandy." [...] He recorded 9.5 sacks in 1981, and his rookie season {{is considered one of the}} best in NFL history. He was named 1981's NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year, making him [...] the only rookie to win an Offensive or Defensive Player of the Year award. Taylor's arrival helped the Giants defense reduce their points allowed from 425 points in 1980 to 257 in 1981. They finished the season 9–7, up five games from the previous season, and advanced to the NFL divisional playoffs, where they lost 38–24 to the eventual Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers. The San Francisco win was due partly to a new tactic 49ers coach Bill Walsh used to slow Taylor. Walsh assigned guard John Ayers, the team's best blocker, to block Taylor and, although Taylor still recorded a sack and three tackles, he was not as effective as normal. In contrast to his on-field success Taylor was already developing a reputation for recklessness off the field; after nearly getting killed during the season when his speeding resulted in a car crash, Young told the team's trainer he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> the linebacker lived past the age of 30, and the Giants insured Taylor's life for $2 million.|$|E

2500|$|On 26 February 2004, Short alleged on the BBC Today radio {{programme}} that British spies regularly intercept UN communications, {{including those of}} Kofi Annan, then Secretary-General. The claim was made {{the day after the}} unexplained dropping of whistleblowing charges against former GCHQ translator Katharine Gun. Reacting to Short's statement, Tony Blair said [...] "I really do regard what Clare Short has said this morning as totally irresponsible, and entirely consistent [...]" [...] Blair also claimed that Short had put British security, particularly the security of its spies, at risk. The same day, on the BBC's Newsnight programme, Short called Blair's response [...] "pompous" [...] and said that Britain had no need to spy on Kofi Annan. Blair did not explicitly deny the claims but Robin Cook, former Foreign Secretary, wrote that in his experience he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> the claims were true.|$|E
2500|$|As a {{cost-saving}} measure HSBC is offshoring processing work {{to lower}} cost economies {{in order to}} reduce the cost of providing services in developed countries. These locations take on work such as data processing and customer service, but also internal software engineering at Pune (India), Gurgaon (India), Bangalore (India), Chennai (India), Hyderabad (India), Vishakhapatnam (India), Kolkata (India), Guangzhou (China), Curitiba (Brazil) and Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia). Chief Operating Officer Alan Jebson said in March 2005 that he would be very surprised if fewer than 25,000 people were working in the centres over the next three years: [...] "I don't have a precise target but I <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> we had less than 15 (global service centres) in three years' time." [...] He went on to say that each centre cost the bank from $20m to $30m to set up, but that for every job moved the bank saves about $20,000 (£10,400). Trades unions, particularly in the UK and US, blame these centres for job losses in developed countries, and also for the effective imposition of wage caps on their members.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008 Dr John Jackson of the Turin Shroud Center of Colorado {{proposed}} a new hypothesis – namely {{the possibility of}} more recent enrichment if carbon monoxide were to slowly interact with a fabric so as to deposit its enriched carbon into the fabric, interpenetrating into the fibrils {{that make up the}} cloth. Jackson proposed to test if this were actually possible. Professor Christopher Ramsey, the director of the Oxford University Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit, took the theory seriously and agreed to collaborate with Jackson in testing a series of linen samples that could determine if the case for the Shroud's authenticity should be re-opened. He told the BBC that [...] "With the radiocarbon measurements and with all of the other evidence which we have about the Shroud, {{there does seem to be}} a conflict in the interpretation of the different evidence." [...] Professor Ramsey stressed that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> the results of the 1988 tests were shown to be far out – especially [...] "a thousand years wrong" [...] – but he insisted that he was keeping an open mind.|$|E

2500|$|The {{amendments}} {{were initially}} received with mixed {{responses from the}} opposition CHP, which have long {{been critical of the}} AKP's constitutional plans. Shortly after the proposals were made public and submitted to Parliament on 10 December, Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım reported that the CHP was in agreement with 5 of the proposed changes. However, reception by the CHP was negative, with the party's deputy leader Selin Sayek Böke claiming that the proposals essentially created a [...] "sultanate". Parliamentary group leader Levent Gök, {{one of the first to}} comment on the released proposals, claimed that the changes would revert 140 years of Turkish parliamentary democracy, calling on all parties to reject the proposals. Another of the CHP's parliamentary group leaders, [...] Özgür Özel, called the proposals a [...] "regime change", with the parliament being left essentially powerless in scrutinising ministers and holding them to account. Özel claimed that the AKP were unlikely to obtain the 330 votes necessary to put the changes to a referendum, stating that he <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>surprised</b> <b>if</b> the number of MPs voting in favour reached 275. CHP MP Selina Doğan claimed that the authoritarian nature of the proposals would effectively end Turkey's EU accession negotiations, citing the lack of any relevance to European values. CHP MP Cemal Oktan Yüksel claimed that the proposals resembled the constitution of Assad's Syria, stating that it wouldn't be a national constitution but [...] "Syria's constitution translated".|$|E
