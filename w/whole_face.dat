5|$|Smallpox virus {{preferentially}} attacks skin cells, {{causing the}} characteristic pimples (called macules) {{associated with the}} disease. A rash develops on the skin 24 to 48 hours after lesions on the mucous membranes appear. Typically the macules first appear on the forehead, then rapidly spread to the <b>whole</b> <b>face,</b> proximal portions of extremities, the trunk, and lastly to distal portions of extremities. The process takes no more than 24 to 36 hours, after which no new lesions appear. At this point variola major infection can take several very different courses, resulting in four types of smallpox disease based on the Rao classification: ordinary, modified, malignant (or flat), and hemorrhagic. Historically, smallpox has an overall fatality rate of about 30 percent; however, the malignant and hemorrhagic forms are usually fatal.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{examined the}} effects of age of acquisition (AoA) and the gender of stimulus faces on familiarity decisions (Experiment 1) and gender decisions (Experiment 2) to the same set of famous and unfamiliar <b>faces</b> presented as <b>whole</b> <b>faces,</b> internal features or external features. In Experiment 1, familiarity decisions were faster to <b>whole</b> <b>faces</b> than to internal or external features. Famous faces with early AoA were recognised faster than later acquired faces, though the effect was only reliable for famous male <b>faces,</b> and for <b>whole</b> <b>faces</b> and internal features rather than for external features. In Experiment 2, gender decisions were made more rapidly to <b>whole</b> <b>faces</b> than to internal or external features. Classification was faster to famous than to unfamiliar faces when the faces were presented as internal features or external features, but not when they were presented as <b>whole</b> <b>faces.</b> More gender classification errors were made to famous than to unfamiliar male faces, but there was no effect of familiarity on the accuracy of responses to female faces. AoA had no effect on gender classification of <b>whole</b> <b>faces</b> or external features. Classification from internal features was faster for early than for late acquired male faces, but faster for late than for early female faces. In the light of the anomalous results for female faces, responses to male faces were analysed separately. The results for the male faces form the focus of the discussion...|$|R
40|$|The view that, as {{children}} get older, {{there is a}} decline in the use of feature-based forms of face processing to more configurational forms of processing was examined by asking 6 -year-old and 9 -year-old children to judge which of two photographs matches an identical probe photograph. The probe and test stimuli were either photographs of <b>whole</b> <b>faces</b> or photographs of isolated facial features. Within this standard method, the stimuli also systematically varied in terms of the familiarity of the faces shown and in the orientation of presentation, both factors that have been interpreted as effecting configurational encoding. A number of age-related effects are observed: (a) older children are better at recognizing <b>whole</b> <b>faces</b> than younger children, (b) older children exhibit a clear face inversion effect with <b>whole</b> <b>faces</b> while the younger children are equally adept at identifying upright and inverted <b>whole</b> <b>faces,</b> and (c) analysis of the recognition rates associated with the individual features reveals that younger children are better than older children when asked to recognize eye regions. It is argued that the data support the view that {{as children}} get older there is a change in the forms of piecemeal encoding employed and an increase in configurational processing...|$|R

De Francisci submitted two reverse designs; one showed a warlike eagle, aggressively breaking a sword; the other an eagle at rest, holding an olive branch. The latter design, which would form the basis for the reverse of the Peace dollar, recalled de Francisci's failed entry for the Verdun City medal. The submitted obverse is almost identical to the coin as struck, excepting certain details of the face, and that the submitted design used Roman rather than Arabic numerals for the date.|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} of Davros {{was designed by}} Nation to have created the Daleks in his image, and to also be a [...] "spokesperson" [...] for the Daleks as {{he felt it was}} [...] "boring" [...] listening to Daleks giving speeches. The design was inspired by the Mekon, a comic book character with no body but a [...] "green, dome-like head" [...] which Hinchcliffe remembered from his childhood. Davros attracted the attention of BBC prosthetics designer John Friedlander who agreed to come off another show to make Davros' mask. The latex mask was moulded to Michael Wisher's face by make-up artist Sylvia James. Wisher could even eat while wearing the mask. Regular latex instead of the more mouldable foam latex was used because the latter was too expensive. [...] The cast and crew regarded Davros' effects as a great technical achievement considering the budget and time period they worked in. Two children visiting Baker at the BBC studios were scared by Wisher in costume; they thought he was a statue at first. When sitting in Davros' Dalek-like base, Wisher wore knee pads and a kilt because trousers were too uncomfortable. To prepare during rehearsals, Wisher acted in a wheelchair with a paper bag over his head that only had slits cut out for his eyes so he would be used to the [...] "disorienting" [...] situation and be able to express himself without using his <b>whole</b> <b>face.</b> Wisher, a heavy smoker, put two holes {{in the top of the}} bag so he could smoke underneath it in rehearsals. Wisher also provided some of the voices for the Daleks with Roy Skelton; in some scenes, he was acting to his own pre-recorded dialogue.|$|E

40|$|People {{are better}} at {{recognizing}} same-than other-race faces but the theoretical explanation of this phenomenon is still controversial. Here we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} "other-race effect'' is related to a reduced ability to encode configural information on other-race faces. Caucasian and Asian participants had to match <b>whole</b> <b>faces</b> to isolated facial features, or onto <b>whole</b> <b>faces</b> differing by a single feature, on both Caucasian and Asian faces. Participants performed better with <b>whole</b> <b>faces</b> as compared to isolated features, demonstrating a "holistic processing'' of faces (Tanaka & Farah, 1993). For Caucasian participants, this "whole/part advantage" was observed only for Caucasian faces. Asian participants who had been living for about a year among Caucasians had a comparable whole/part advantage regardless the race of the faces. These results indicate that same-race faces are processed more holistically than other-race faces, as a result of experience. However, despite processing Caucasian faces as holistically as Asian faces in this paradigm, Asian subjects still presented a large other-race effect. This observation suggests that holistic encoding may be a necessary step {{in order to be able}} to recognize other-race faces efficiently, but that it is by no means sufficient to overcome the other-race face effect...|$|R

2500|$|Others, such as N. W. Thomas and Sigmund Freud have {{rejected}} this explanation. Freud explains that [...] "the associated theory of magic merely explains the paths along which magic proceeds; {{it does not}} explain its true essence, namely the misunderstanding which leads it to replace {{the laws of nature}} by psychological ones". Freud emphasizes that what led primitive men to come up with magic is the power of wishes: [...] "His wishes are accompanied by a motor impulse, the will, which is later destined to alter the <b>whole</b> <b>face</b> of the earth in order to satisfy his wishes. This motor impulse is at first employed to give a representation of the satisfying situation {{in such a way that}} it becomes possible to experience the satisfaction by means of what might be described as motor hallucinations. This kind of representation of a satisfied wish is quite comparable to children's play, which succeeds their earlier purely sensory technique of satisfaction. [...] As time goes on, the psychological accent shifts from the motives for the magical act on to the measures by which it is carried out—that is, on to the act itself. [...] It thus comes to appear as though it is the magical act itself which, owing to its similarity with the desired result, alone determines the occurrence of that result." ...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} how face-selective cortical areas process configural and componential face {{information and}} how race of faces may influence these processes. Participants saw blurred (preserving configural information), scrambled (preserving componential information), and <b>whole</b> <b>faces</b> during fMRI scan, and performed a post-scan face recognition task using blurred or scrambled faces. The fusiform face area (FFA) showed stronger activation to blurred than to scrambled faces, and equivalent responses to blurred and <b>whole</b> <b>faces.</b> The occipital face area (OFA) showed stronger activation to whole than to blurred faces, which elicited similar responses to scrambled faces. Therefore, the FFA {{may be more}} tuned to process configural than componential information, whereas the OFA similarly participates in perception of both. Differences in recognizing own- and other-race blurred faces were correlated with differences in FFA activation to those faces, suggesting that configural processing within the FFA may underlie the other-race effect in face recognition. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|It is a {{widespread}} assumption that all primate species process faces {{in the same way}} because the species are closely related and they engage in similar social interactions. However, this approach ignores potentially interesting and informative differences that may exist between species. This paper describes a comparative study of holistic face processing. Twelve subjects (six chimpanzees Pan troglodytes and six rhesus monkeys Macaca mulatta) were trained to discrim- inate <b>whole</b> <b>faces</b> (faces with features in their canonical position) and feature-scrambled faces in two separate conditions. We found that both species tended to match the global configuration of features over local features, providing strong evidence of global precedence. In addition, we show that both species were better able to generalize from a learned configuration to an entirely novel configuration when they were first trained to match feature-scrambled faces compared to when they were trained with <b>whole</b> <b>faces.</b> This result implies that the subjects were able to access local information easier when facial features were presented in a scrambled configuration and is consistent with a holistic processing hypothesis. Interestingly, these data also suggest that, while holistic processing in chimpanzees is tuned to own-species faces, monkeys have a more general approach towards all faces. Thus, while these data confirm that both chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys process faces holistically, they also indicate that there are differences between the species that warrant further investigation...|$|R

Speed and accuracy of performance were assessed for stimuli presented (i) as <b>whole</b> <b>faces</b> and (ii) as internal features. When presented as <b>whole</b> <b>faces,</b> the task was easy, as revealed by ceiling levels of accuracy and no effect of familiarity or angle of rotation on response times. However, when stimuli were presented as internal features, an influence of facial familiarity was evident. Unfamiliar faces showed no increase in difficulty across angle of rotation, whereas familiar faces showed a marked increase in difficulty across angle, which was explained by significant linear and cubic trends in the data. Results were interpreted in terms of the benefit gained from a mental representation when face processing was impaired by stimulus rotatio...|$|R

40|$|In the "Thatcher illusion" a face, {{in which}} the eyes and mouth are {{inverted}} relative {{to the rest of}} the face, looks grotesque when shown upright but not when inverted. In four experiments we investigated the contribution of local and global processing to this illusion in normal observers. We examined inversion effects (i. e., better performance for upright than for inverted faces) in a task requiring discrimination of whether faces were or were not "thatcherized". Observers made same/different judgements to isolated face parts (Experiments 1 - 2) and to <b>whole</b> <b>faces</b> (Experiments 3 - 4). Face pairs had the same or different identity, allowing for different processing strategies using feature-based or configural information, respectively. In Experiment 1, feature-based matching of same-person face parts yielded only a small inversion effect for normal face parts. However, when feature-based matching was prevented by using the face parts of different people on all trials (Experiment 2) an inversion effect occurred for normal but not for thatcherized parts. In Experiments 3 and 4, inversion effects occurred with normal but not with thatcherized <b>whole</b> <b>faces,</b> on both same- and different-person matching tasks. This suggests that a common configural strategy was used with <b>whole</b> (normal) <b>faces.</b> Face context facilitated attention to misoriented parts in same-person but not in different-person matching. The results indicate that (1) face inversion disrupts local configural processing, but not the processing of image features, and (2) thatcherization disrupts local configural processing in upright faces...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the role of}} local and global information on perceptual encoding of faces in patient HJA, who shows prosopagnosia and visual agnosia following occipito-temporal damage. HJA and an age-matched control were tested in a simultaneous matching task which focused on detection of local changes in faces: the inversion of central parts (eyes and mouth) relative to their context (as in the Thatcher illusion). Same-different judgements were made to normal, "that cherised" and mixed type <b>face</b> pairs. <b>Whole</b> <b>faces</b> (Experiment 1), or face parts (Experiment 2), were presented in upright and inverted orientations. Compared to the control, HJA was severely impaired at matching <b>whole</b> <b>faces,</b> but he improved dramatically when face parts were presented in isolation. This suggests an inhibitory influence of face context on HJAs processing of local parts and a relatively intact ability to process part-based information from a face (when context cannot interfere). Face inversion did not affect HJAs performance. A control experiment (Experiment 3) with non-face stimuli (houses) suggested that the inhibitory influence of context on HJAs performance was restricted to faces. These results indicate that contextual information in a face can have an adverse influence on the processing of local part-based information in prosopagnosia...|$|R

Furthermore, cells were tuned to the geometry of facial features. Tuning was most often ramp-shaped, with a one-to-one mapping of feature magnitude to firing rate. Tuning amplitude depended on the presence of a <b>whole,</b> upright <b>face</b> and features were interpreted according to their position in a <b>whole,</b> upright <b>face.</b> Thus, cells in the middle face patch encode axes of a face space specialized for <b>whole,</b> upright <b>faces...</b>|$|R
