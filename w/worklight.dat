50|$|Many theaters use scoop lights for <b>worklights,</b> rehearsals, {{non-performance}} times, {{and certain}} performance times. Scoops {{can be used}} to mimic the effect of a striplight to illuminate a cyclorama. They are easy to set up and take down, are relatively inexpensive, typically have long lamp life. When used as <b>worklights,</b> scoop lights frequently don't require the use of the light board to operate.|$|R
50|$|<b>Worklights</b> {{can also}} be used during {{performances}} and rehearsals, to provide dim lighting for technicians backstage.|$|R
50|$|In 2012 IBM {{acquired}} New York- and Shefayim-based {{mobile application}} developer <b>Worklight</b> Ltd., founded in 2006 by Shahar Kaminitz, formerly of Amdocs.|$|E
50|$|The {{equipment}} possibly {{includes an}} ultrasonic cleaning appliance, {{as well as}} a small table to hold the instrument tray, a <b>worklight,</b> and possibly a computer monitor or display.|$|E
5000|$|... jQuery Mobile is a touch-optimized web {{framework}} (also {{known as}} a mobile framework), more specifically a JavaScript library, currently being developed by the jQuery project team. The development focuses on creating a framework compatible {{with a wide variety}} of smartphones and tablet computers, made necessary by the growing but heterogeneous tablet and smartphone market. The jQuery Mobile framework is compatible with other mobile app frameworks and platforms such as PhoneGap, <b>Worklight</b> and more.|$|E
50|$|<b>Worklights</b> are not {{designed}} to light the stage in an aesthetically pleasing way, but rather to be efficient in terms of space and heat; however, they may occasionally be used to emphasize plot elements during a show. They are generally near-white. <b>Worklights</b> are usually placed on catwalks and battens, or can be permanently built in. If not hardwired into the control system, the connectors are often marked or attached {{in a way to}} prevent them from mistakenly being removed during a strike/load out.|$|R
50|$|<b>Worklights</b> {{are often}} {{built into a}} theatre as a {{fluorescent}} light, as in the photo at the top right. However, some theatres may use, {{as a supplement to}} or instead of the fluorescent lights, either the normal stage lights (which produce a lot of heat) or just scoops.|$|R
5000|$|In 1938, Wilsbech {{founded the}} company {{and in the early}} 1950s, he {{discovered}} a number of problems with the conventional incandescent <b>worklights</b> available. This developed his idea to encase a fluorescent bulb in a resilient, clear, butyrate tube. This was marketed as a [...] "Light in a tube" [...] originally with a 21-inch fluorescent bulb encased.|$|R
50|$|IBM Mobile Foundation, {{formerly}} named <b>Worklight</b> - {{a mobile}} enterprise application platform {{that supports the}} development of HTML5, hybrid and native mobile applications. It {{can be used with}} most popular mobile development tools and includes an Eclipse-based IDE that allows mobile developers to make full use of HTML5 functionality and enhance these capabilities with utilities such as encryption of locally stored data, offline authentication, and 3rd-party library integration with frameworks such as PhoneGap, Sencha Touch, jQuery, and more.|$|E
50|$|First {{developed}} at an iPhoneDevCamp event in San Francisco, PhoneGap {{went on to}} win the People's Choice Award at O'Reilly Media's 2009 Web 2.0 Conference, and the framework has been used to develop many apps. Apple Inc. has confirmed that the framework has its approval, even with the new 4.0 developer license agreement changes. The PhoneGap framework is used by several mobile application platforms such as Monaca, appMobi, Convertigo, ViziApps, and <b>Worklight</b> as the backbone of their mobile client development engine.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the first}} image the {{breathing}} tubes run to a control panel on his chest, and the regulator can be seen. The image shows two spacesuits, whose helmets differ. One has a <b>worklight</b> on top; {{the other has}} two worklights, one on each side, and on top what is intended to represent a radio spike antenna and microwave horn antenna (two different antennas are also shown in a second book illustration, though the [...] "microwave horn" [...] antenna is incorrectly drawn attached by its wide end like an animal horn, instead of the correct musical-horn-like shape of a microwave horn antenna).|$|E
25|$|House lights provide {{light on}} the theater's seats and aisles for the {{audience}} before and after performances and during intermissions. They are generally incandescent lights, however fluorescent lights or scoops {{may be used in}} some instances. House lights are often controlled by dimmers, but are sometimes on simple switches. <b>Worklights</b> provide general lighting backstage or in the house, and are often fluorescent fixtures. Work lights are almost always non-dimmed.|$|R
50|$|Architectural {{lighting}} control systems can integrate with a theater's on-off and dimmer controls, {{and are often}} used for house lights and stage lighting, and can include <b>worklights,</b> rehearsal lighting, and lobby lighting. Control stations can be placed in several locations in the building and range in complexity from single buttons that bring up preset options-looks, to in-wall or desktop LCD touchscreen consoles. Much of the technology is related to residential and commercial {{lighting control}} systems.|$|R
50|$|The {{benefit of}} {{architectural}} lighting control {{systems in the}} theater is the ability for theater staff to turn <b>worklights</b> and house lights on and off without having to use a lighting control console. Alternately, the light designer can control these same lights with light cues from the lighting control console so that, for instance, the transition from houselights being up before a show starts and the first light cue {{of the show is}} controlled by one system.|$|R
50|$|Before his MBA, Dalle {{worked for}} four years with Procter & Gamble (P&G) in IT and Finance. At P&G he {{implemented}} enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.After his MBA, Dalle worked for McKinsey & Company in Zurich for 15 months.In 1997 Dalle joined Index Ventures in Geneva, {{one year after the}} company’s founding. At Index Ventures Dalle has invested {{in a number of different}} companies and served on the Boards of Directors of a variety of firms, including Assistly (sold to Salesforce.com); B-hive (sold to VMware); DimDim (sold to Salesforce.com); FilesX (sold to IBM); Gluster (sold to RedHat for $136 million); and <b>Worklight</b> (sold to IBM).|$|E
50|$|In theater, a <b>worklight</b> is a high-intensity {{light fixture}} {{which is used}} to {{illuminate}} the stage for the benefit of technicians. Technicians use these lights, rather than the stage lights for a number of reasons. Firstly, it takes much less technical knowledge to turn on worklights, so even people with no knowledge of electrics can turn them on. Secondly, regardless of the lights hung for the specific show, they provide fairly consistent and complete lighting. Finally, and most importantly, they are designed to be cheap and easy to re-lamp, in contrast to theatrical fixtures, which have expensive lamps and would burn through color gels if used to illuminate stage work.|$|E

50|$|In theater, {{running lights}} are any lights that the {{audience}} does not see, but are on during a performance. They are different from <b>worklights</b> which are not used during a show. One type of running light is the lights set in wings or crossovers for actors and technicians {{to find their way}} in the (mostly) dark. These are usually rope lights or traditional fixtures with a colored lamp or colored gel over them. Booth staff will also use running lights to illuminate control boards or scripts. One brand marketed for this specific purpose is LittLite. Cue lights are distinct from running lights.|$|R
2500|$|Most {{theatrical}} {{light bulbs}} (or lamps, the term usually preferred) are tungsten-halogen (or quartz-halogen), an improvement {{on the original}} incandescent design that uses a halogen gas instead of an inert gas to increase lamp life and output. [...] Fluorescent lights are infrequently used other than as <b>worklights</b> because, although they are far more efficient, they are expensive to make dimmed (run at less than full power) without using specialised dimmer ballasts and only very expensive models will dim to very low levels. They also do not produce light from a single point or easily concentrated area, and usually have a warm-up period, during which they emit no light or do so intermittently. [...] However fluorescent lights are being used more and more for special effects lighting in theaters. High-intensity discharge lamps (or HID lamps), however, are now common where a very bright light output is required—for example in large follow spots, hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide (HMI) floods, and modern automated fixtures. [...] When dimming is required, it is done by mechanical dousers or shutters, as these types of lamps also cannot be electrically dimmed.|$|R
40|$|More and more, {{enterprises}} {{are providing}} multi-channel support to their web channel communities. This article explains how IBM ® WebSphere ® Portal and IBM <b>Worklight</b> ™ enable enterprises to create <b>Worklight</b> applications capable of automatically logging a user in upon startup, while also using single sign-on (SSO) to log the user into a WebSphere Portal server {{on the same}} host at the same time. This {{makes it easy for}} mobile apps to display portal pages customized to the user from within the application. This article applies to IBM <b>Worklight</b> V 6. 0 and later.

40|$|This volume {{contains}} the extended abstracts {{of the contributions}} presented at EclipseIT 2013, the 8 th workshop of the Italian Eclipse Community, hosted by the Computer Science Department of the University of Milan (Crema Campus) on September 19 - 20, 2013. Although Eclipse was initially designed as an integrated development environment (IDE) for object-oriented application development, today it represents an open development platform comprised of extensible frameworks, tools and runtimes for building, deploying and managing software. Around Eclipse, an international live community continuously works on improving the framework and on promoting the use of Eclipse. That happens also in Italy. This workshop is, indeed, the eighth yearly meeting of the Italian Eclipse Community which includes universities, public institutions and industries, researchers and practitioners, students and professionals, all joined by the interest in experimenting, extending, and supporting the Eclipse platform. The special topic of this edition is the Software cooperative development for mobile applications. Two tutorials are offered on this theme: (1) Sviluppo di applicazioni enterprise per il mobile con IBM Jazz, Eclipse e <b>Worklight</b> by Ferdinando Gorga from IBM, and (2) Uso di Eclipse per lo sviluppo cooperativo del software, by Paolo Maresca of the University of Naples, Federico II.
