40|$|The active {{fracture}} modes in glass-ceramics, {{produced by}} controlled crystallization from three starting vitreous products containing PbO and SiO 2, were studied and compared. The {{goal was to}} examine the active fracture modes in PbO-rich glass-ceramic materials, where the main glass former was PbO, and compare these results with those reported in the literature, where the main glass former was SiO 2. The influence of composition, shape and mean size of the ceramic phase on the active fracture modes of the glass-ceramics was also examined. It was observed that the microhardness and fracture toughness of the starting vitreous products decrease with increasing PbO content. Increase in the relative amount of SiO 2 resulted in a decrease of the percentage of the ceramic phase.

Methods: Four carious human third molars were sectioned through the caries lesion in the mesiodistal longitudinal plane. One {{half of each}} lesion underwent carious dentine removal using Carisolv™ gel.

Results: The microhardness of carious dentine decreased gradually towards the cavity floor, but that for caries-affected dentine showed more variation with depth, having a mean hardness of (0. 63 ± 0. 18) GPa. Ca:P ratios of carious dentine varied among the four specimens. The mean Ca:P ratio of caries-affected dentine was 1 : 2. 03 ± 0. 08. The hypothesis was accepted for active lesions.

In this research, high-purity Al was processed by equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) at room temperature through 1 – 8 passes. Analysis shows that processing by ECAP produces a UFG structure with a grain size of ~ 1. 3 lm and <b>with</b> <b>microhardness</b> and microstructural homogeneity. Micro-compression testing was carried out with different specimen dimensions using the annealed sample and after ECAP processing through 1 – 8 passes. The results show the flow stress increases significantly after ECAP processing by comparison with the annealed material. The flow stress generally reaches a maximum value after 2 passes which is consistent with the results of microhardness. The flow stress decreases with decreasing specimen diameter from 4 mm to 1 mm which demonstrates that size effects also exist in the ultrafine-grained materials.
