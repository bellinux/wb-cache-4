5|$|Between 06:00 and 12:00 UTC on September10, the United States Weather Bureau issued storm signals, {{equivalent}} to a tropical storm <b>warning</b> <b>in</b> , from Cedar Key, Florida, to Charleston, South Carolina. These were later upgraded to hurricane warnings in South Florida. Due to inclement weather conditions in West Palm Beach, which had been newly incorporated as a town just days earlier, businesses suspended their normal operations and people boarded up buildings, even as the strongest winds arrived. As the cyclone moved into the Gulf of Mexico, reports from September 12 through September 14 helped ships prepare for the storm.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} of the tropical depression, officials in Puerto Rico closed public schools and sent federal workers home early.

Two hours later, areas from Savannah, Georgia, to Cape Hatteras North Carolina, were placed under a tropical storm warning. They were later discontinued at an unknown time. Residents of Charleston, South Carolina, complained of little <b>warning</b> <b>in</b> advance of the storm. However, as Chris moved ashore only nine hours after becoming a tropical storm, there was minimal time for preparations.|$|E

Later that day, the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning and hurricane watch from Florida City to Vero Beach after the storm's intensification became apparent. About 25hours before Katrina made landfall, the tropical storm watch was extended northward to Titusville, and a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch was issued for Lake Okeechobee. Early on August25, a hurricane warning was issued from Florida City to Vero Beach and for Lake Okeechobee. In southeastern Florida, the lead time for the hurricane watch and warning occurred 31.5 and 19.5hours before landfall, respectively; both were 16.5hours less than the desired lead time. A tropical storm warning was also issued from Florida Key, southward through the Florida Keys to the Dry Tortugas, and northward along the western coast to Longboat Key. The <b>warning</b> <b>in</b> the Florida Keys occurred only nine hours {{before the onset of}} tropical storm force winds.|$|E

5|$|After {{affecting}} the Turks and Caicos Islands, the hurricane {{passed through the}} Bahamas. The eye crossed over Nassau, where a barometric pressure of 938mbar (27.70inHg) was reported. Based on this observation, the hurricane is estimated to have had sustained winds of 140mph (220km/h). The hurricane struck without <b>warning</b> <b>in</b> the Bahamas, either washing ashore or sinking every ship but one in Nassau. In addition, strong winds downed trees and destroyed roofs. Every building in Nassau was damaged or destroyed. After moving through the islands, the hurricane curved northeastward, affecting dozens of other ships and wrecking four. On October4, it passed north of Bermuda, where it produced Force11 winds on the Beaufort scale. The hurricane was last observed on October5 to the southeast of Atlantic Canada. Along its path through the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas, and the western Atlantic, the hurricane killed at least 383people, making it among the 100 deadliest Atlantic hurricanes as of 1997.|$|E

5|$|Early in the storm's development, {{forecasting}} Erika's {{motion was}} difficult, with a persistent leftward bias in official forecasts. In response to Erika's threat, {{the government of}} Saint Martin first issued a tropical storm warning late on September 4. The next day, the respective governments of Antigua, Montserrat, Barbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Anguilla, Dominica, Guadeloupe, and Saint Barthélemy issued tropical storm warnings for their islands. When Erika's motion resulted in a path that would take it closer to the islands, all of the aforementioned islands excluding Guadeloupe upgraded the tropical storm warning to a hurricane <b>warning.</b> <b>In</b> addition, a hurricane watch was issued for the British and United States Virgin Islands, as well as Puerto Rico. In public advisories, the National Hurricane Center stated tropical storm conditions {{were likely to be}} experienced in the Azores. Early forecasts anticipated a threat to the island of Bermuda.|$|E

By September15, the islands of Agrihan, Tinian and Saipan before being upgraded to tropical storm warnings and a typhoon watch. Additionally, the watches in place for Guam and Rota were discontinued. These warnings were kept in force until late on September 14, when the warnings for Tinian were canceled and the typhoon watch for Saipan was canceled, while the typhoon watch was upgraded to a Typhoon Warning as Choi-wan rapidly intensified. The Tropical Storm <b>Warning</b> <b>in</b> place for Saipan was canceled during September 15 as Choi-wan intensified into a high-end Category 4 equivalent super typhoon. All watches and warnings were discontinued during the afternoon of September16 once Choi-wan was no longer a threat to the Mariana Islands.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{issuance}} of a hurricane <b>warning</b> <b>in</b> North Carolina on August17, mandatory evacuation orders were declared for the outermost islands in the state. Local police assisted significant traffic as an estimated 50,000 to 100,000 people left the region. At {{the height of the}} evacuations, delays in some places exceeded three hours. Despite the large number of evacuees, an additional 50,000 people were estimated to have stayed home and wait out the storm. Several bridges in the area were shut down prior to Bob's arrival as hurricane-force winds were likely to create life-threatening conditions on them. The National Park Service in the state also shut down campgrounds across the Outer Banks. An evacuation shelter was also opened in Carteret County.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the cyclone, the Australian government distributed financial and emergency aid, offering to provide assistance to hard-hit banana and sugar cane farmers in northern Queensland. Hundreds of State Emergency Service (SES) volunteers were deployed to restore electrical and water services, evacuate local citizens, provide food, and repair and protect structures. The Department of Social Security (DSS) sent employees to receive claims for damage, requests for financial aid, and filings for unemployment benefits. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth of Australia initiated a three-year, $150million program to provide relief to damaged areas. Fund payments, however, were frequently incorrectly distributed, and in some cases, fraudulent. In the confusion in the days following the cyclone, looters stole possessions in areas within the vicinity of Innisfail, and relief efforts were impeded by thunderstorms at Cairns. The Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) was subject to heavy criticism in the days following the storm's landfall, accused of not giving ample <b>warning</b> <b>in</b> advance of Winifred's approach; however, these concerns were later addressed in its report on the cyclone's impact. Due to the severity of the storm's damage, the name Winifred was retired after the season ended.|$|E
