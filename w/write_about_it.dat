5|$|Ginko {{receives}} a letter requesting his presence from Tanyu, a woman infected with a Mushi that demands her {{to write about}} Mushi to expel it. On the way, he meets Koro, a Mushishi {{who is trying to}} capture a rainbow-like Mushi. They go to the house of Tanyu, where her nanny, Tama, says that a white-haired woman told them about the Tokoyami. When Tanyu tried to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> she was afflicted by paralysis and gangrene. Ginko then asks to read about the Tokoyami; while he is reading, the Tokoyami from the writings leave them and return to Tanyu, further exacerbating her condition.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, Greeley {{traveled}} {{across the}} continent to see the West for himself, to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> for the Tribune, and to publicize {{the need for a}} transcontinental railroad. He also planned to give speeches to promote the Republican Party. He went to Chicago, then to Lawrence in Kansas Territory, and was unimpressed by the local people. Greeley took one of the first stagecoaches to Denver, seeing the town then in course of formation as a mining camp of the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. Sending dispatches back to be published in the Tribune, Greeley took the Overland Trail, reaching Salt Lake City, where he conducted a two-hour interview with the Mormon leader, Brigham Young, the first newspaper interview Young had given. Greeley encountered Native Americans, and was sympathetic, but like many of his time, deemed Indian culture inferior. In California, he explored widely and gave many addresses.|$|E

25|$|With the {{exception}} of Zhu Xi’s work, all extant commentaries to the Cantong qi written through the Yuan period (1279-1368) {{are related to the}} Taoist alchemical traditions. During the Ming (1368–1644) and the Qing (1644-1912) dynasties, the Cantong qi continued to exert its prestige on Neidan, but its influence also extended to other fields. Zhu Xi’s commentary, in particular, inspired many literati to read the text and <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> The commentaries by Xu Wei 徐渭 (ca. 1570) and Wang Wenlu 王文祿 (1582) during the Ming period, and those by Li Guangdi 李光地 (ca. 1700), Wang Fu 汪紱 (ca. 1750), and Li Shixu 黎世序 (1823) during the Qing period, are representative of this trend.|$|E
25|$|Roland and his ka-tet {{travel to}} Thunderclap, {{then to the}} nearby Devar-Toi, to stop a group of psychics known as Breakers who are {{allowing}} their telepathic abilities {{to be used to}} break away at the beams that support the Tower. Ted Brautigan and Dinky Earnshaw assist the gunslingers with information and weapons, and reunite Roland with his old friend Sheemie Ruiz from Mejis. The Gunslingers free the Breakers from their captors, but Eddie is wounded after the battle and dies a short while later. Roland and Jake pause to mourn and then jump to Maine of 1999 along with Oy, in order {{to save the life of}} Stephen King (whom he writes to be an omniscient secondary character in the book); the ka-tet have come to believe that the success of their quest depends on King surviving to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> through his books.|$|E
25|$|For the {{remainder}} of the millennium, and much of the next, Little Petra remained unknown to all but the Bedouin nomads who sometimes camped in it or its vicinity. Europeans, who could not visit the Arab world under Islamic rule, heard about Petra but were unsure of its existence. When Swiss traveler Jacob Burckhardt became the first Western visitor to Petra since Roman times in 1812, he did not venture to its north, or did not <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Later Western visitors to the region likewise seem to have concentrated on the main Petra site. Only in the late 1950s did British archaeologist Diana Kirkbride supplement her excavations at Petra itself with digs in the Beidha area, which included Little Petra, not described as a separate site at the time. Those digs continued until 1983, two years before UNESCO inscribed the Petra area, including Beidha and Little Petra, as a World Heritage Site.|$|E

25|$|Sales of The Yellow Tape were jump-started {{when the}} band {{was taken off the}} bill for the 1991 New Year's Eve concert in Nathan Phillips Square outside Toronto City Hall because a staffer for then-mayor June Rowlands saw the band's name and felt it {{objectified}} women; the decision was further affirmed by city councillor Chris Korwin-Kuczynski. The band shrugged it off and booked another show at McMaster University. However, the media got wind of the story and decided to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> as an example of political correctness gone too far. The first article earned the paper a large quantity of mail against City Hall's decision. The story became more and more prominent until about a week after New Years, when {{the band was}} asked to take a photo in front of City Hall for {{the front page of the}} Toronto Star. The stories targeted Rowlands even though she had not been directly involved in the decision to remove the band from the concert, but in fact had been out of town at the time. The following week, sales of the Yellow Tape exploded — by February 1992, it was outselling even Michael Jackson's Dangerous, Genesis' We Can't Dance and U2's Achtung Baby in some downtown Toronto record stores. They received enough publicity from the incident that MuchMusic offered them its second-ever Intimate and Interactive special on January 17. The tape eventually became the first ever indie release to achieve platinum status (100,000 copies) in Canada.|$|E

500|$|In October 1866 Massenet and Ninon were married; {{their only}} child, Juliette, {{was born in}} 1868. Massenet's musical career was briefly {{interrupted}} by the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71, during which {{he served as a}} volunteer in the National Guard alongside his friend Bizet. He found the war so [...] "utterly terrible" [...] that he refused to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in his memoirs. He and his family were trapped in the Siege of Paris but managed to get out before the horrors of the Paris Commune began; the family stayed for some months in Bayonne, in southwestern France.|$|E

500|$|Manning's {{other works}} {{have largely been}} {{described}} as precursors to the two trilogies. Her pre-war novel, The Wind Changes (1937), set in Ireland, anticipates the future works in its [...] "subtle exploration of relationships {{against a backdrop of}} war." [...] Her post-war works, which are alternately set at home and abroad, are considered first, less than successful steps in clarifying her ideas about an expatriate war and how to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> Novels and stories set in England and Ireland are permeated by staleness and discontent, while those set abroad highlight the excitement and adventure of her later works. Two books set in Jerusalem, The Artist Among the Missing (1949) and School for Love (1951), her first commercial and critical success, are also first steps in exploring themes such war, colonialism and British imperialism.|$|E

The song features Dorian Crozier and Michael Bland on drums, and Fields on bass, guitars and keyboards. Nick Jonas also played the guitar and percussion on the song. The song is registered as [...] "Did You Forget" [...] with the Broadcast Music, Inc. Lovato has stated that [...] "Don't Forget" [...] {{is one of the}} songs on Don't Forget that she relates to the most, and that she felt [...] "a lot of emotion while recording it". In an interview with PopEater, she elaborated, [...] "Everyone goes through the experience of falling in love, but then the other person just walks away, and goes somewhere else. I went through an experience like that and wanted to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> I got over it, and now a year later I don't have those feelings about that person anymore."

500|$|Another Hemingway scholar, Jim Berloon, {{disagrees with}} Tetlow, writing that its only unity {{consists}} of similarities in tone and {{style and the}} recurrence of the Nick Adams character. Although the first vignettes share a common thread about the war, each is distinctly framed, weakening any structural unity that might have existed. He blames the war, {{saying that it was}} too hard for Hemingway to <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> cohesively, that it was [...] "too large, terrible, and mentally overwhelming to grasp in its entirety". Instead, he says, Hemingway wrote fragments, [...] "discrete glimpses into hell... like the wreckage of battle lit up from a shell burst at night." [...] The structure apparent in the 1924 collection of vignettes is lost in the later edition because the short stories seem to bear little if any relationship to the interchapters, shattering the carefully constructed order. The sense of discordance is intensified because the action is about unnamed men and soldiers, only referred to with pronouns, and unspecified woundings. The characters are transformed through circumstances and settings, where danger exists overtly, on the battlefield, or, in one case, by a chance sexual encounter in a Chicago taxi.|$|E
500|$|In the AIA Guide to Chicago, the Ponds are {{identified}} {{as part of the}} [...] "circle of young architects", including Frank Lloyd Wright, that was responsible for [...] "transforming the concepts of the Arts & Crafts movement into the indigenous Prairie [...] School." [...] Pond was a contemporary, and in some ways rival, of Wright in the Chicago architectural scene of the late 19th and early 20th Centuries. [...] Both were members of the Chicago Architectural Club and served as judges and participants in the Club's annual competitions. [...] One biographer of Wright noted that Wright was insulted when the American Institute of Architects in 1912 commissioned a study of midwestern [...] "progressive architecture" [...] and instructed the investigators to examine the work of Louis Sullivan and Pond, but not including Wright. [...] In a letter to Lewis Mumford, Wright expressed his dislike for the [...] "truly-old" [...] Pond:"Yesterday someone told me that truly-old I.K. Pond took exception to your 'Sticks and Stones' because you weren't a 'practicing architect.' [...] What 'practicing architects' know anything at all of architecture anyway, -- even if they could <b>write</b> <b>about</b> <b>it?</b> [...] Certainly not he.
