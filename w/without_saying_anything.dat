At 10:30a.m. Broome County Communications {{received}} several 911 calls, and the first police were dispatched to the scene. Two of the Civic Association's receptionists {{were among the first}} victims shot. While one of the receptionists was reported to have been shot through the head and killed, the second, shot in the stomach, feigned death and, when the gunman moved on, took cover under a desk and called 911. The receptionist's call was taken by 911 staff at 10:38a.m. The wounded receptionist, 61-year-old Shirley DeLucia, remained on the line for 39 minutes, despite her gunshot wound, and relayed information until she was rescued. She later recounted that the gunman had opened fire <b>without</b> <b>saying</b> <b>anything.</b>|$|E

I said, [...] "Mr. Mauriac," [...] we called him Maître, [...] "ten years or so ago, I have seen children, {{hundreds}} of Jewish children, who suffered more than Jesus did on his cross and we do not speak about it." [...] I felt all of a sudden so embarrassed. I closed my notebook and went to the elevator. He ran after me. He pulled me back; he sat down in his chair, and I in mine, and he began weeping.... And then, at the end, <b>without</b> <b>saying</b> <b>anything,</b> he simply said, [...] "You know, maybe you should talk about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Nominative {{determinism}} is {{the hypothesis}} that people tend to gravitate towards areas of work that fit their names. The term was first used in the magazine New Scientist in 1994, after the magazine's humorous Feedback column noted several studies carried out by researchers with remarkably fitting surnames. These included a book on polar explorations by Daniel Snowman and an article on urology by researchers named Splatt and Weedon. These and other examples led to light-hearted speculation {{that some sort of}} psychological effect was at work. Since the term appeared, nominative determinism has been an irregularly recurring topic in New Scientist, as readers continue to submit examples. Nominative determinism differs from the related concept aptronym, and its synonyms aptonym, namephreak, and Perfect Fit Last Name, in that it focusses on causality. [...] "Aptronym" [...] merely means the name is fitting, <b>without</b> <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> about why it has come to fit.|$|E

5000|$|Trevor {{also has}} a {{tendency}} to delve into deep, Orwellian rants, which often serve as narration for the episodes. These musings appear to be in the form of soliloquies, but in the episode [...] "The Purge," [...] they are shown to be out loud. His musings tend to be confusing, often running the full length <b>without</b> actually <b>saying</b> <b>anything,</b> and lend to the series' own ambiguous nature.|$|R
500|$|The first table read of {{the episode}} was held on January 9, 1991. The episode was filmed {{in front of a}} live {{audience}} on January 15, 1991. Filming {{of the episode}} took place at the CBS Studio Center in Studio City, Los Angeles, California, where, starting with the season premiere [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend", filming of all the show's episodes took place. A few scenes were changed prior to the filming of the episode. The scene in which Jerry informs George he told Elaine about the apartment initially showed them standing in line for the movies, talking about sitting {{in the front of the}} theatre. George would tell Jerry that he once pretended to have a grotesque physical impairment while he was standing in line to get a ticket for The Exorcist (1973), and people would let him go in front of them <b>without</b> <b>saying</b> <b>anything.</b> The location of this scene, however, was changed to Monk's Cafe, a regular hangout for the show's main characters, and George and Jerry's dialogue was shortened. In the original script, Jerry, instead of George, proclaimed himself [...] "lord of the idiots", but this was changed during rehearsals.|$|E

2500|$|The accuser and {{his brother}} both testified that on one brief occasion, they saw Jackson naked, but the boys {{described}} the incident differently. According to Star, the brothers were watching a movie on Jackson's bed and Jackson came in to fetch [...] "something." [...] Star testified that Jackson [...] "had a hard-on," [...] and that he told the boys, who were [...] "grossed out," [...] that nudity was natural. Star said Jackson stayed for two minutes {{and sat on the}} bed, but neither brother spoke a word during that time. According to Gavin, the boys were [...] "just laying there" [...] when Jackson [...] "ran up there and got something and went back downstairs," [...] <b>without</b> <b>saying</b> <b>anything.</b> Gavin did not describe Jackson as having an erection.|$|E

2500|$|On 1 September 2015, while {{saying nothing}} of the {{canonical}} status of the Society itself, Pope Francis [...] "establish that those who during the Holy Year of Mercy approach [...] to celebrate the Sacrament of Reconciliation shall validly and licitly receive the absolution of their sins." [...] He thus granted them the faculty, which can be given by the law itself or by the competent authority, needed for exercising validly in this sacrament the power of orders. On {{the conclusion of the}} Holy Year of Mercy, on 20 November 2016, Pope Francis, again <b>without</b> <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> of the Society as such, but [...] "trusting in the good will of their priests to strive with< God's help for the recovery of full communion in the Catholic Church", extended for them this faculty [...] "until further provisions are made".|$|E
2500|$|It is {{said that}} getting flown over by a mikoshi-nyūdō results in death or getting strangled by the throat, and if one falls back due to {{looking up at the}} nyūdō, one's {{windpipe}} would get gnawed at and killed. On Iki Island off Kyushu, a mikoshi-nyūdō would make a [...] "wara wara" [...] sound like the swaying of bamboo, so by immediately changing, [...] "," [...] the nyūdō would disappear, but it {{is said that}} if one simply goes past them <b>without</b> <b>saying</b> <b>anything,</b> bamboo would fall resulting in death. In the Oda District, Okayama Prefecture, it is said that when one meets a mikoshi-nyūdō, it is vital to lower one's vision to the bottom of one's feet, and if one instead looks up to the head from the feet, one would be eaten and killed. Other than this, other than changing [...] "mikoshita (seen past)" [...] or [...] "minuita (seen through)," [...] there are also examples where they would disappear by mustering one's courage and smoking tobacco (Kanagawa Prefecture), or by calculating the height of the mikoshi-nyūdō by a margin (Shizuoka Prefecture), among other methods.|$|E

Then mysteriously Jimmy turned up at a gig I was playing in Boston and it was like those difficult last days of Led Zep had vanished. We had this understanding again <b>without</b> doing or <b>saying</b> <b>anything.</b> We talked about the MTV thing and decided to see where we could take it.|$|R
50|$|The {{great thing}} about this band is that each member was coming from a {{different}} place musically, where we started introducing one another to different bands and artists, and I think this is reflected {{in what is now}} our signature sound. Before long we were being asked by local press and just people in general how we'd describe our music, which at the time was a vague mixture of folk, country and Americana. None of these seemed to accurately define us though, so 'Cymrucana' was originally a tongue-in-cheek comment that became our standard response to the question, and a way of defining the band <b>without</b> really <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> at all. The truth is that the 'Cymrucana' scene consists solely of Climbing Trees. We're quite open to other bands and artists joining us though, if they so wish….|$|R
2500|$|In {{the later}} {{years of its}} first run on Sat.1 (circa 2001-2003), the Harald Schmidt Show became a critics' {{favourite}} due to Schmidt's [...] "intellectual" [...] sense of humour, especially for incorporating many references to high culture (be it literature, theater, classical music, painting, or cinema), history, and philosophy. Another recurring item were forays into surrealism and absurdity that were pretty much anathema to commercial or [...] "mainstream" [...] interest: For example, Schmidt hosted one show completely in French (re-broadcast {{a few days later}} on Franco-German channel Arte, this Show en Francaise episode gained glowing reviews from French critics). On another occasion, the screen was blacked for half of the show making it into a [...] "radio broadcast". Another time, he disproved a critic who had written {{that it is impossible to}} spend several minutes on TV just cracking nuts <b>without</b> anybody <b>saying</b> <b>anything.</b> The show's reviews and renown among critics gradually worsened during the years of its ARD run (2004-2010), especially because Schmidt's choice of Oliver Pocher as a new sidekick was considered a mistake that diminished the entire show's quality.|$|R

60|$|There lived {{not many}} years since a very aged gentlewoman in London, in Water-lane, by Fleet-street, {{whose name was}} Pight, who was endowed with a prophetic spirit; and the ingenious Mr. Beaumont, whom I {{personally}} knew, and who had a familiar genius himself, gives the world this account of her. She was very well known, says he, to many persons of my acquaintance now living in London. Among others, a gentleman, whose candour I can no way suspect, has told me, that he often resorted to her as to an oracle; and {{that as soon as}} he came into her presence, she would usually tell him, that she knew what he was coming for, for that she had seen his spirit for some time before; and <b>without</b> his <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> to her, she would commonly tell him what the business was which he came to consult her about, and what the event of it would be; which he always found to fall out as she said, and many other persons now living can testify the like experience of her as to themselves.|$|R
50|$|Some couples create sexual {{interest}} by watching erotic and pornographic videos. Role playing may involve the partners wearing costumes, {{to create and}} maintain a sexual fantasy. For variety, the partners can make up a (sexual) story together. One of them starts with a sentence {{and then the other}} continues until the story becomes sexually explicit, and it provides an opportunity for the partners to express their sexual fantasies. 'Strangers for a day' is a role playing game which consists of the couple playing roles of the first meeting between them. In a public meeting place, the partners pretend to be strangers meeting for the first time. The objective is for them to flirt and seduce the other, <b>without</b> doing or <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> that they normally would not do or say at a first meeting.|$|R
5000|$|The lyrics {{have the}} singer daydreaming {{for a girl}} to love, singing that he waits [...] "between shows" [...] for his lover. [...] Young has claimed that he wrote the song [...] "for a city girl on peeling {{pavement}} coming at me through Phil Ochs' eyes playing finger cymbals. It was hard to explain to my wife." [...] The city girl playing finger cymbals is a reference to folk singer Jean Ray. Music critic Johnny Rogan described the lyrics as [...] "exotic and allusive <b>without</b> really <b>saying</b> <b>anything</b> at all." [...] Critic Toby Creswell describes the lyrics as [...] "cryptic love lyrics" [...] noting that they are sung [...] "over the crunching power of Crazy Horse." [...] Critic John Mendelsohn felt the song conveyed a message of [...] "desperation begetting brutal vindictiveness," [...] hinted at by the [...] "almost impenetrably subjective words" [...] but carried strongly {{by the sound of}} Crazy Horse's [...] "heavy, sinister accompaniment."Introducing the song at a performance associated with Writer's Week at Whittier College (California) in April, 2015, Los Lobos co-founder Louie Perez said that when he first heard [...] "Cinnamon Girl", he was sure it was about a Mexican girl.|$|R

5000|$|One form {{of moral}} {{nihilism}} is expressivism. Expressivism denies {{the principle that}} our moral judgments try and fail to describe the moral features, because expressivists believe when someone says something is immoral they are not saying it is right or wrong. Expressivists {{are not trying to}} speak the truth when making moral judgments; they are simply trying to express their feelings. [...] "We are not making an effort to describe the way the world is. We are not trying to report on the moral features possessed by various actions, motives, or policies. Instead, we are venting our emotions, commanding others to act in certain ways, or revealing a plan of action. When we condemn torture, for instance, we are expressing our opposition to it, indicating our disgust at it, publicizing our reluctance to perform it, and strongly encouraging others not to go in for it. We can do all of these things <b>without</b> trying to <b>say</b> <b>anything</b> that is true." [...] p. 293.|$|R
