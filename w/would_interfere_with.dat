5|$|Despite {{concerns}} that Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Maximilian von Spee's Pacific Squadron of two armoured cruisers <b>would</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> proceedings, the SEF {{arrived at the}} capital of Samoa, Apia, on 29 August. It made an unopposed landing, covered by the guns of the accompanying escorts, and secured the Government offices in the town {{as well as the}} wireless station several miles away. Logan, now the Military Administrator of Samoa with the island's governor a prisoner of war, oversaw the official raising of the Union Jack flag the following day, formally declaring the occupation of Samoa.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, Portsmouth F.C. {{announced}} plans {{to move away from}} Fratton Park to a new stadium situated on a piece of reclaimed land beside the Historic Dockyard, nicknamed Portsmouth Dockland Stadium. The £600 million mixed-use development, designed by architects Herzog & de Meuron, would also include 1500 harbourside apartments as well as shops and offices. The scheme attracted criticism due to its large size and location, with some officials saying that it <b>would</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> harbour operations. The £600 million project for a new stadium was rejected by the city council due to the financial crisis of 2008.|$|E

5|$|In February 1944, Rotblat {{joined the}} Los Alamos Laboratory {{as part of}} Chadwick's British Mission to the Manhattan Project. The usual {{condition}} for people {{to work on the}} Manhattan Project was that they had to become U.S. citizens or British subjects. Rotblat declined, and the condition was waived. At Los Alamos, he was befriended by Stan Ulam, a fellow Polish-Jewish scientist, with whom he was able to converse in Polish. Rotblat worked in Egon Bretscher's group, investigating whether high-energy gamma rays produced by nuclear fission <b>would</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the nuclear chain reaction process, and then with Robert R. Wilson's cyclotron group.|$|E
5|$|Marie St. Clare – Wife of Augustine, {{she is a}} self-absorbed woman {{without a}} hint of {{compassion}} for those around her, including her own family. Given to an unending list of (apparently imaginary) physical maladies, she continually complains about the lack of sympathy she is receiving. She has separated her personal maid, Mammy, from her own two children because they <b>would</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> her duties. As Marie drives Mammy to exhaustion, she criticizes her for selfishly seeking to attend her own family. Upon the unexpected death of Augustine, Marie countermands the legal process that would have given Tom his freedom.|$|E
5|$|One {{stipulation}} the USACE {{placed on}} the permit, however, was that no work in the Arkansas riverbed could take place after May 1 if it <b>would</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the interior least tern nesting period, which was possible if the birds selected nesting sites around the bridge site. As a result, OTA worked to complete the bridge {{as quickly as possible}} to avoid the possibility of having to suspend the construction. By April 1991, work in the riverbed was mostly complete, with the remaining work on the bridge posing no threat to the terns.|$|E

5|$|The Act {{stipulated that}} {{researchers}} {{could not be}} prosecuted for cruelty, but that the animal must be anaesthetized, unless the anaesthesia <b>would</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> {{the point of the}} experiment. Each animal could be used only once, although several procedures regarded as part of the same experiment were permitted. The animal had to be killed when the study was over, unless doing so would frustrate the object of the experiment. Prosecutions could take place only with the approval of the Home Secretary. At the time of the Brown Dog affair this was Aretas Akers-Douglas, who was unsympathetic to the anti-vivisectionist cause.|$|E
5|$|Common to all {{crimes against}} {{the person is}} the {{infringement}} {{of the right to}} bodily integrity. It extends to the touching of clothing, for example, and where no physical harm actually results. However, if all touchings were criminalised, this <b>would</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the right to liberty. It is the very touching, and not the harm, that is the violation of principle. This is related to the right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The central statute on this topic is Offences against the Person Act 1861, which brought together a multitude of difference offences, with much overlap and inconsistent terminology. These include both the actual infliction and the threat of violence. Although criticised, the Act has not been replaced.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) {{designated}} the proposed expressway as I-895 {{instead of the}} originally proposed I-295. The expressway was planned to extend the existing Route 37 by , and {{was scheduled to be}} completed by 1975. In 1971, however, the expressway's original routing was canceled due to community opposition in the towns of Barrington and Warren and concerns that a new bridge across Upper Narragansett Bay <b>would</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> aviation traffic at T. F. Green Airport. In 1971, RIDOT submitted a new proposed alignment for I-895 that utilized the Jamestown and Newport Bridges in southern Newport County and bypassed Barrington and Warwick altogether, but the interstate was ultimately canceled in 1982.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, RIDOT {{reviewed}} {{plans for}} an eastern extension of Route 37. The department conducted planning studies on two proposed freeway alignments that would extend Route 37 into Downtown Warwick. The first proposal continued the freeway southeast from US 1 to Airport Road for , while the second proposal extended the freeway east for , intersecting Route 117 and Route 117A {{in the village of}} Hoxsie before terminating at Route 117 (West Shore Road). The first option was ultimately dropped by RIDOT after studies indicated the routing <b>would</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> aviation traffic at T. F. Green Airport. The freeway extension to Route 117, however, remains on RIDOT's long-term plans.|$|E
5|$|In December 1986, the Public Roads Administration {{recommended}} a bridge. A report published by SBT in 1987 considered detailed {{plans for a}} subsea tunnel to the mainland, which was followed up by seismic surveys in the fjord. SBT {{changed its name to}} Sunnhordland Bru- og Tunnelselskap, and a majority of the board shifted towards being in favor of a fixed link. The Norwegian Coastal Administration stated that they would not allow a pontoon bridge, as it <b>would</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> ship traffic. On 26 June 1987, SBT's board decided to work towards getting permission to collect advance tolls on the ferry services. On 16 September, they unanimously supported the triangular proposal, which was estimated to cost NOK660 million. This was criticized by Hordaland Public Roads Administration, who stated that it would take a longer time to plan, and thus complete, the Triangle Link.|$|E
5|$|NESCo were {{represented}} by Craig Henderson and Sydney Turner. The NESCo representatives argued {{that although the}} company already supplied around 85% of the North East region, {{a great deal more}} generating capacity would need to be built to meet the demand for years to come, and that the mid-Durham area was the best place to erect a new station. Henderson claimed the only real opposition to the scheme was that it <b>would</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the amenities of Durham. John Hacking, chief engineer of the Central Electricity Board, backed NESCo because if the scheme were declined, and consent and new arrangements had to be made, they would have no new plant in operation until after 1948.|$|E

5|$|Public {{opposition}} to the project was broad. The Adelaide City Council objected to the plan {{on the basis that}} it <b>would</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the well-designed layout of the city proper. In response, the government altered the plan to redirect the line underneath the city, at a considerable increase in cost. Residents in inner-city suburbs such as St Peters were concerned about the noise of the light rail vehicles, and protested against any disruption of the Torrens Gorge in the Modbury corridor. Test drilling commenced for the tunnel, but the entire light rail project was halted in 1980 after Premier David Tonkin appointed Michael Wilson, an opponent of the plan, as Transport Minister.|$|E
5|$|Scheer {{decided to}} reverse {{the course of the}} fleet with the Gefechtskehrtwendung, a {{maneuver}} that required every unit in the German line to turn 180° simultaneously. As a result of their having fallen behind, the ships of the II Battle Squadron could not conform to the new course following the turn. Hannover and the other five ships of the squadron therefore were located on the disengaged side of the German line. Mauve considered moving his ships {{to the rear of the}} line, astern of the III Battle Squadron dreadnoughts, but decided against it when he realized the movement <b>would</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the maneuvering of Admiral Franz von Hipper's battlecruisers. Instead, he attempted to place his ships at the head of the line.|$|E
5|$|The RTA, by then renamed to Sound Transit, began {{a series}} of public {{hearings}} in late 1997 to determine the routing of the line. Tukwila leaders preferred a route serving the Southcenter Mall that would add six to seven minutes of travel time and $150 million in project costs. The Sound Transit Board chose an at-grade line on International Boulevard as their preferred routing in February 1999, which the city argued <b>would</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> their near-term plans to revamp the street. The board's preferred route, selected in November 1999, included an at-grade line on International Boulevard through Tukwila and an elevated station at South 154th Street with a park and ride facility.|$|E

5|$|The {{mourning}} dove {{is closely related}} to the eared dove (Zenaida auriculata) and the Socorro dove (Zenaida graysoni). Some authorities describe them as forming a superspecies and these three birds are sometimes classified in the separate genus Zenaidura, but the current classification has them as separate species in the genus Zenaida. In addition, the Socorro dove has at times been considered conspecific with the {{mourning dove}}, although several differences in behavior, call, and appearance justify separation as two different species. While the three species do form a subgroup of Zenaida, using a separate genus <b>would</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> the monophyly of Zenaida by making it paraphyletic.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Conrad {{began dating}} actor Kyle Howard. Howard {{expressed}} concern that appearing on reality television <b>would</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> his acting career; consequently, their relationship was not documented on The Hills. (After three years together, Conrad and Howard ended their relationship in 2011.) Upon {{the conclusion of the}} fourth season of the series that December, Conrad wished to leave the series to pursue other career opportunities. However, per the producers' requests, she filmed ten episodes for the following season, in which she closed her storylines. Conrad made her final appearance on the series in May 2009, attending Montag and Pratt's wedding after much deliberation during the mid-season finale of the fifth season. However, in the July 2009 issue of Cosmopolitan, she stated that producers had pressured her into a reconciliation with Montag throughout the season, adding that she was displeased when they would not allow otherwise. Conrad was replaced by former Laguna Beach castmate Kristin Cavallari until the series' conclusion in July 2010.|$|E
5|$|After their 2010 separation, Berry and Aubry became {{involved}} in a highly publicized custody battle, centered primarily on Berry's desire to move with their daughter from Los Angeles, where Berry and Aubry resided, to France, the home of French actor Olivier Martinez, whom Berry had started dating in 2010 after they met while filming Dark Tide in South Africa. Aubry objected to the move {{on the grounds that}} it <b>would</b> <b>interfere</b> <b>with</b> their joint custody arrangement. In November 2012, a judge denied Berry's request to move the couple's daughter to France in light of Aubry's objections. Less than two weeks later, on November 22, 2012, Aubry and Martinez were both treated at a hospital for injuries after engaging in a physical altercation at Berry's residence. Martinez performed a citizen's arrest on Aubry, and because it was considered a domestic violence incident, was granted a temporary emergency protective order preventing Aubry from coming within 100 yards of Berry, Martinez, the child with whom he shares custody with Berry, until November 29, 2012. In turn, Aubry obtained a temporary restraining order against Martinez on November 26, 2012, asserting that the fight began when Martinez threatened to kill Aubry if he did not allow the couple to move to France. Leaked court documents included photos showing significant injuries to Aubry's face, which were widely displayed in the media.|$|E
