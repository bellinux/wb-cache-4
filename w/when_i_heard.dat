25|$|On October 17, 2017 Frank Ocean's dad, Calvin Cooksey, sued Frank {{on charges}} of {{defamation}} and other damages with restitution payments reaching up to 14.5 million dollars. The issue started when Frank Ocean wrote a post in his personal Tumblr responding to the Pulse Nightclub shooting back in June 2016 and told {{a story about how}} when he was a kid, he heard his father use a transphobic slur towards a waitress. The post stated that:'I was six years old <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> my dad call our transgender waitress a f***** as he dragged me out a neighborhood diner saying we wouldn’t be served because she was dirty. 'That was the last afternoon I saw my father and the first time I heard that word, I think, although it wouldn’t shock me if it wasn’t. Many hate us and wish we didn’t exist.' The judge ended up ruling in favor of Frank Ocean and the case was put to an end.|$|E

The second version of the video premiered on May 3, 2012 on MTV. Director X summarized the synopsis of the video saying, [...] "it was just cars and the simplicity that they liked.

500|$|One thing I {{remember}} {{having had a}} really depressing effect on me was the first Ramones album. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> it , I mean {{it was a great}} record... but I hated it because I knew we'd been doing this sort of stuff for years. There was even a chord progression on that album that we used... and I thought, [...] "Fuck. We're going to be labeled as influenced by the Ramones", when nothing could have been further from the truth.|$|E
500|$|The {{survivors}} {{were interviewed}} {{for the media}} and by investigators about their experience.

[...] Another gave this description of being burned by the steel: [...] "When the steel hit, it felt like being beaten by iron bars -- my brain went blank.

500|$|Stefani asked DJ Jeremy Healy {{to create}} a mashup of the song and [...] "The Lonely Goatherd", a song from the 1959 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical and 1965 film The Sound of Music. Stefani {{considered}} The Sound of Music her favorite film, and {{she had wanted to}} incorporate a beat to one of its songs all her life. Stefani commented, [...] "I literally cried, and I'm not exaggerating, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> the mash-up." [...] Williams, however, did not like the addition of yodeling and The Sound of Music to the track.|$|E
500|$|I {{love this}} song for many reasons. It had a {{different}} sound {{than a lot of}} my songs. I related to it personally more than other songs, and I have so much fun with it. I thought if it could be a single that it would be incredible to perform it all the time ... What stands out about the song [...] I can dance to it and rock out to it, which is ultimately my goal.

500|$|In 1936, Kalep {{published}} {{the first edition}} of Air Babies, a children's book that she wrote and illustrated to teach children about flying. The story followed two young planes, Happy Wings and Speedy, and a 1938 reprint included a foreword from Earhart, who embarked on her last flight three days after writing the piece; she disappeared while flying in 1937. Kalep later said of Earhart's disappearance: [...] "I miss her very much. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that Amelia had disappeared, well, I fell apart." [...] She visited the 1939 New York World's Fair to promote Air Babies on television and to speak at the National Woman's Party luncheon.|$|E

500|$|Christopher Reeve, {{star of the}} Superman films, {{expressed}} his approval of the show:I {{was a little bit}} skeptical <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> about [...] at first, but I must say the writing, the acting, and the special effects are quite remarkable. In 1977, a big stunt scene would have taken us a week to film—it's pretty impressive what they are able to do with computers and effects technology today on a weekly TV show. It gives it a lot more production value and inventiveness than I thought I was going to see when I first heard about the series. I think the show is doing a really good job following the mythology, and Tom {{is doing a good job}} following the tradition.|$|E
6000|$|My {{reply to}} this was, I am afraid, rather absently given. The truth is, {{my mind was}} running on some earlier words which had dropped from the old lady's lips.

500|$|Kelly {{has also}} {{provided}} songs {{for many other}} artists, tailoring them to their particular vocal range. Women at the Well (2002) had 14 female artists record his songs in tribute. According to Kelly, he adapted his song [...] "Foggy Highway" [...] for Renée Geyer because [...] "I admired her deep soul singing, ferocious and vulnerable ... <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> the finished version ... the hairs rose {{up on the back}} of my neck." [...] Kelly and The Stormwater Boys recorded it in a bluegrass style as the title track for the 2005 album Foggy Highway. Divinyls' lead singer Christina Amphlett recorded [...] "Before Too Long"—she was attracted by the lyrics—she interpreted the song's narrator as being a stalker, and provided a female perspective in a darkly menacing manner à-la Fatal Attraction.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{certainly}} think [...] references {{me a lot}} in her work," [...] Madonna said in the ABC interview. [...] "And sometimes I think it's amusing and flattering and well-done. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> [...] on the radio ... I said, 'that sounds very familiar." [...] Gaga herself addressed the comparisons on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, explaining that she had received an e-mail from Madonna's representatives, who had mentioned their support for [...] "Born This Way". CNN later reported that Madonna's representatives were not aware that the singer, or her team, had sent Gaga an e-mail regarding the situation. AllMusic also note a [...] "striking similarity" [...] between [...] "Express Yourself" [...] and Kylie Minogue's 1991 single [...] "What Do I Have to Do", writing that [...] "Kylie Minogue has always displayed a strong Madonna influence—something she’s readily admitted to in interviews." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{character}} departure was Smalljon Umber, {{played by}} Dean S. Jagger. In an interview, Jagger {{talked about his}} casting: [...] "I prayed for it. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> I got the part my knees buckled. It was a life-changing moment." [...] Before becoming a professional actor, Jagger dug trenches and worked at a mattress factory to pay his way through acting school and was a professional rollerblader. Ian Whyte also made his last appearance in [...] "Battle of the Bastards" [...] as the giant, Wun Wun; he had played Gregor Clegane during the show's second season. Special-effects supervisor Joe Bauer said about Whyte's casting as Wun Wun, [...] "We wanted a large performer because somebody who would be 14, 15 feet tall would have more weight and mass to move around, and a person who's a normal size would have {{a very difficult time}} pulling that off".|$|E
