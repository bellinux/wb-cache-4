5|$|A {{monument}} {{was originally}} in the highway median at the Toronto terminus of the highway, {{dedicated to the}} 1939 visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth and known as the Lucky Lion. The column, with a crown {{at the top and}} a lion at the base, was designed by W. L. Somerville and sculptors Frances Loring and Florence Wyle for C$12,000 (in 1940, $ adjusted for inflation). The monument was removed in 1972 in order to accommodate <b>widening</b> <b>of</b> the original QEW, and relocated in August 1975 to the nearby Sir Casimir Gzowski Park along Lake Ontario, {{on the east side of}} the Humber River.|$|E
5|$|By 1955, talks began about {{upgrading}} the highway. After a proposition to turn {{much of the}} route into a toll road failed, it was decided a four-lane freeway {{would be the best}} decision. However, opposition from residents in surrounding neighborhoods as well as a federal oil embargo only allowed <b>widening</b> <b>of</b> the approach between Fairgrounds Drive and I-80. In 1977, a levee broke and flooded a portion of the developed land, turning it into protected wetlands that is home to endangered species. Because of its new status, environmental studies were needed in order to continue the project.|$|E
5|$|C# is more type safe than C++. The only {{implicit}} conversions {{by default}} {{are those that}} are considered safe, such as <b>widening</b> <b>of</b> integers. This is enforced at compile-time, during JIT, and, in some cases, at runtime. No implicit conversions occur between Booleans and integers, nor between enumeration members and integers (except for literal 0, which can be implicitly converted to any enumerated type). Any user-defined conversion must be explicitly marked as explicit or implicit, unlike C++ copy constructors and conversion operators, which are both implicit by default.|$|E
