5|$|A Six Person Intergender Tag Team Bimbo Brawl {{match with}} Traci Brooks as the Special Guest Referee was next, pitting {{the team of}} ODB, Rhaka Khan, and Rhino against The Beautiful People (Angelina Love, Cute Kip, and Velvet Sky). In this bout, {{both male and female}} wrestlers could fight each other and all weapons <b>were</b> <b>legal</b> to use. The only way to win was by pinfall or submission. Rhino won the match for his team after {{tackling}} Kip with his signature Gore maneuver at 6 minutes and 15 seconds.|$|E
5|$|After {{going to}} the ground, Jackson managed to slip out of the choke. Jackson began to attack with ground and pound, dealing strikes to Silva's body while Silva {{answered}} with the same from the bottom. Jackson began to land punches to Silva's face, and the latter attempted a Juji-gatame, a variation of an armbar. Silva could not pull off the hold, and Jackson moved into side control shortly after. From here, Jackson threw punches to Silva's head and followed by landing two knees, again to the head (which <b>were</b> <b>legal</b> under Pride rules).|$|E
5|$|In 1833, the Tolpuddle Martyrs {{founded the}} Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers. Trade unions <b>were</b> <b>legal</b> {{but because the}} members swore an oath of allegiance, they were arrested and tried in the Shire Hall. Beneath the {{courtroom}} are cells where the prisoners were held while awaiting trial. Dorchester Prison was constructed in the town during the 19th century and was used for holding convicted and remanded inmates from the local courts until it closed in December 2013. Plans have since been made to erect 189 dwellings and a museum on the site.|$|E

5|$|Police {{departments}} throughout Oregon {{decline to}} press charges, or {{charges have been}} dropped for possessing and growing marijuana, even for convicted drug dealers. Salem police estimated they received 30 or 40 calls for marijuana activity in 2007 which were not pursued because the grow operations <b>were</b> <b>legal,</b> even one next to a high school. One grower, a previously convicted felon, was found with evidence of making hash oil, which is not protected, though a grand jury did not indict him.|$|E
5|$|The cent was {{the first}} {{official}} United States coin to be struck at the Philadelphia Mint in 1793. These pieces, today known as large cents, were made of pure copper and were {{about the size of}} a half dollar. They were struck every year, except 1815 due to a shortage of metal, but were slow to become established in commerce. Worn Spanish colonial silver pieces were then commonly used as money throughout the United States. At the time, both gold and silver <b>were</b> <b>legal</b> tender there, but copper coins were not; the federal government would not redeem them or take them in payment of taxes.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Fox {{started the}} Fox, Fowler and Company bank in Wellington which rapidly {{expanded}} and ran successfully, until it merged with Lloyds Bank in 1927. It {{was the last}} private bank in England to issue its own notes and they <b>were</b> <b>legal</b> tender until 1964. There are nine notes left in circulation. The British Museum have another example on display. The bank established its Head Office at the old family house in Fore Street, Wellington (today the Lloyds Bank branch) - they opened branches at Taunton, Bridgwater, Weston-super-Mare, Torrington, Bideford, Barnstaple, Ilfracombe and South Molton.|$|E
5|$|A fairly {{peculiar}} economic phenomenon {{occurred during}} the war in that the Confederate government issued both regular money notes and interest-bearing money, although the United States did issue Interest Bearing Notes during the war that <b>were</b> <b>legal</b> tender for most financial transactions. The circulation of the interest-bearing money and the convertibility of one kind of money into the other was enforced by fiat and Southern banks were threatened with a return to the gold standard if they did not cooperate. Because of the amount of Southern debt held by foreigners, to ease currency convertibility, in 1863 the Confederate Congress decided to adopt the gold standard, although actual convertibility was not to come into effect until 1879 (hence the law never went into effect, being supplanted by the Coinage Act of 1873 {{and the end of the}} Confederacy).|$|E

He supported gun control laws, outlawing racial profiling, and subsidies for Amtrak. He was the chief sponsor, along with U.S. Senator Sam Brownback, of the Darfur Accountability Act. He voted against the Iraq War Resolution. Corzine was the prime sponsor, along with fellow New Jersey U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg, of a federal version of John's Law, in memory of Navy Ensign John R. Elliott (a native of New Jersey), a U.S. Naval Academy graduate who {{was killed by a}} drunk driver. The legislation provides federal highway safety grant incentives to encourage states to impound the cars of DUI suspects. He was an early contributing blogger at The Huffington Post.|$|E

5|$|In August 1993, police raided Jackson's home and, {{according}} to court documents, found books and photographs in his bedroom featuring young boys {{with little or no}} clothing. Since the books <b>were</b> <b>legal</b> to purchase and own, the jury decided not to indict Jackson. Jordan Chandler gave police a description of Jackson's intimate parts; a strip search revealed that Jordan had correctly claimed Jackson had patchy-colored buttocks, short pubic hair, and pink and brown marked testicles. Reportedly, Jordan had also drawn accurate pictures of a dark spot on Jackson's penis only visible when his penis was lifted. Despite differing initial internal reports from prosecutors and investigators, with reports of jurors feeling that the photos did not match the description, the DA stated his belief in a sworn affidavit that the description was accurate, along with the sheriff's photographer stating the description was accurate. A 2004 motion filed by Jackson's defense asserted that Jackson was never criminally indicted by any grand jury and that his settlement admitted no wrongdoing and contained no evidence of criminal misconduct.|$|E
5|$|Moyer, who {{had never}} argued before the Supreme Court, {{continued}} to represent Jacobson (who was in the audience). In his brief and at oral argument, he said that a mere stated interest in sex among young men did not rise {{to a level of}} proving predisposition, that the government should have had evidence in hand that Jacobson was actually willing to break the law to do so. (Kenneth Starr, then Solicitor General, had maintained in the government's brief opposing certiorari that his prior purchase of the Bare Boys magazines was all the proof it needed, even if the action <b>were</b> <b>legal</b> at the time.) Pressed on other undercover investigative techniques, he admitted that a government-run pawn shop would be a permissible way to apprehend thieves despite a lack of evidence of predisposition because the crimes might well have occurred prior to any contact with the government or its operatives.|$|E
5|$|Odex's {{actions against}} file sharing <b>were</b> <b>legal</b> actions against Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and their {{subscribers}} in Singapore by Odex, a Singapore-based company that virtually distributes sub-licensed Japanese anime. From early 2007 to January 2008 Odex took action against {{anyone who had}} downloaded anime through BitTorrent for alleged copyright infringement. Odex tracked their IP addresses without their consent and sought subpoenas to compel the ISPs to disclose the personal details of these subscribers. After rulings from the Subordinate Courts, Odex took personal data from affected ISPs and sent letters demanding payment in place of litigation. More {{than a third of}} the individuals contacted by Odex opted to settle out of court for at least S$3,000 (US$2,000) to S$5,000 (US$4,000) each.|$|E

5|$|Team Nash versus Team Jarrett {{began on}} the March18 episode of Impact! when Nash {{requested}} a six man tag team cage match at Lockdown from Rhodes. The following week, Rhodes granted the request and officially announced it for the Lockdown card. On the April8 episode of Impact!, Rhodes proclaimed that the encounter was now a Lethal Lockdown match, in which weapons <b>were</b> <b>legal</b> and one wrestler from each team started the match. Afterwards, members from each team entered at time intervals until all wrestlers {{were involved in the}} bout so a pinfall or submission could occur. The storyline behind this encounter revolved around Jarrett and his reign as NWA World Heavyweight Champion. At Against All Odds, Jarrett successfully defended the title against Nash, which Waltman and The Outlaw interfered with by aiding Nash and Jarrett, respectively. At TNA's previous PPV event Destination X on March13, Jarrett defended the title against Page, in which Brown turned on Page by helping Jarrett retain the title.|$|E
5|$|The Alversund Bridge was a toll bridge {{which was}} {{paying for the}} debt {{accumulated}} in its construction. By 1968, the debt would be paid off, but the Norwegian Public Roads Administration launched a plan whereby the tolls {{would continue to be}} collected and used to finance a bridge across Salhusfjorden. This was opposed by a group of locals, who brought the issue to the courts, claiming it to be illegal, as a bridge would never be built. Both Oslo District Court and Eidsivating Court of Appeal concluded that the tolls <b>were</b> <b>legal,</b> and the issue was rejected by the Supreme Court. Protests were also raised against the use of a pontoon bridge, as it would limit the vessel size and thus the commercial development in the inner parts of the fjord.|$|E
5|$|The Ossetian {{people are}} {{indigenous}} to North Ossetia, {{located in the}} North Caucasus. Controversy surrounds the date of Ossetian arrival in Transcaucasia. According to one theory, they first migrated there during the 13th and 14th centuries AD, and lived alongside the Georgians peacefully for centuries. In 1918, conflict began between the landless Ossetian peasants living in Shida Kartli, who were influenced by Bolshevism and demanded ownership of the lands they worked and the Menshevik government backed ethnic Georgian aristocrats, who <b>were</b> <b>legal</b> owners. Although the Ossetians were initially discontented with the economic policies of the central government, the tension soon transformed into ethnic conflict. During uprisings in 1919 and 1920, the Ossetians were covertly supported by Soviet Russia, but even so, were defeated.|$|E

5|$|The fifth {{match on}} the card was a New Jersey Street Fight pitting the team of Christian Cage and Rhino against Team 3D (Brother Devon and Brother Ray). In this match, weapons <b>were</b> <b>legal</b> to use {{and there were no}} count-outs or disqualifications. Early in the match, both teams fought {{throughout}} the crowd, at which time they both used weapons against each other. The match ended when Cage performed a frog splash aerial maneuver onto Ray from atop a ladder, followed up by Rhino performing his signature Gore maneuver into Ray against a table placed up in the ring corner. Rhino then pinned Ray to win the contest at 15 minutes and 22 seconds. After the match, Team 3D's associate Johnny Devine came out to help attack Cage and Rhino, however, Abyss came to their rescue and slammed Devine back-first onto the mat with his trademark Black Hole Slam maneuver while Team 3D made their retreat.|$|E
5|$|A Six Man Tag Team Full Metal Mayhem match {{followed}} pitting {{the team}} of Kurt Angle and Team 3D against A.J. Styles, Christian Cage, and Rhino. The duration of the contest was 15 minutes and 55 seconds. In this bout, {{the only way to}} win was by pinfall or submission, all weapons <b>were</b> <b>legal</b> and encouraged, and there were no disqualifications. Cage ascended the steel supports left behind from the Ultimate X match during the bout to jump off in an aerial splash onto both members of Team 3D and Angle. Each participant of the match was forced through a table during the bout except Angle. Rhino was the first by Team 3D, followed by Cage also by Team 3D. Each member of Team 3D were then forced through a table by Styles. After this, Johnny Devine interfered in the encounter on Team 3D's behalf by attempting to hit Styles with a kendo stick, only to be kicked in the head by Styles. Later, Styles laid Angle on a table and ascended a ladder. At this time, Frank Trigg interfered by hitting Styles over the head with the kendo stick, allowing Angle to force Styles through the set-up table with his signature Olympic Slam maneuver for the pinfall victory.|$|E
5|$|In early 1914, Ruth {{signed a}} {{professional}} baseball contract with Jack Dunn, who owned and managed the minor-league Baltimore Orioles, an International League team. The circumstances of Ruth's signing {{are not known}} with certainty; historical fact is obscured by stories that cannot all be true. By some accounts, Dunn was urged to attend a game between an all-star team from St. Mary's and one from another Xaverian facility, Mount St. Mary's College. Some versions have Ruth running away before the eagerly awaited game, to return in time to be punished, and then pitching St. Mary's to victory as Dunn watched. Others have Washington Senators pitcher Joe Engel, a Mount St. Mary's graduate, pitching in an alumni game after watching a preliminary contest between the college's freshmen and a team from St. Mary's, including Ruth. Engel watched Ruth play, then told Dunn about him at a chance meeting in Washington. Ruth, in his autobiography, stated only that he worked out for Dunn for a half-hour, and was signed. According to biographer Kal Wagenheim, there <b>were</b> <b>legal</b> difficulties to be straightened out as Ruth was supposed to remain at the school until he turned 21.|$|E
