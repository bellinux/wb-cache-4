5000|$|The oak {{forests of}} the {{southern}} and central Appalachians consist largely of black, northern red, <b>white,</b> <b>chestnut</b> and scarlet oaks ( [...] and [...] ) and hickories, such as the pignut (...) in particular. The richest forests, which grade into mesic types, usually in coves and on gentle slopes, have dominantly white and northern red oaks, while the driest sites are dominated by chestnut oak, or sometimes by scarlet or northern red oaks. In the northern Appalachians the oaks, except for white and northern red, drop out, while the latter extends farthest north.The oak forests generally lack the diverse small tree, shrub and herb layers of mesic forests. Shrubs are generally ericaceous, and include the evergreen mountain laurel (...) , various species of blueberries ( [...] spp.), black huckleberry (...) , a number of deciduous rhododendrons (azaleas), and smaller heaths such as teaberry (...) and trailing arbutus (...) [...] The evergreen great rhododendron (...) is characteristic of moist stream valleys. These occurrences {{are in line with}} the prevailing acidic character of most oak forest soils. In contrast, the much rarer chinquapin oak (...) demands alkaline soils and generally grows where limestone rock is near the surface. Hence no ericaceous shrubs are associated with it.|$|E

50|$|The {{purple heron}} {{is a large}} bird, 78 - 97 cm in length with a {{standing}} height from 70 to 94 cm and a 120 - 152 cm wingspan. However, it is slender for its size, weighing only 0.5 to 1.35 kg. It is somewhat smaller than the grey heron, from which it can be distinguished by its darker reddish-brown plumage, and, in adults, its darker grey back. Adults have the forehead and the crown of the head black, with a dark stripe {{down the back of}} the neck that terminates in a slender, dangling crest. This is shorter than the crest of the grey heron and does not exceed 140 mm. The sides of the head and the neck are buffish chestnut, with dark streaks and lines down either side of the whole the neck. The mantle is oily brown and the upper scapular feathers are elongated but not the lower ones. The rest of the upper parts and the tail are brownish grey. The front of the neck is paler than the sides and there are some elongated feathers at the base of the neck which are streaked with <b>white,</b> <b>chestnut</b> and black. The breast is chestnut brown, with some blackening at the side, and the belly and under-tail coverts are black. The brownish-yellow beak is long, straight and powerful, and is brighter in colour in breeding adults. The iris is yellow and the legs are brown at the front and yellowish behind.|$|E

La muestra estuvo compuesta por 73 adultos mayores que reportaron la presencia de pensamientos intrusos como un problema regular, con edades entre 61 - 79 años. Los mismos fueron divididos aleatoriamente en dos grupos de trabajo: WCH y placebo (PLA). Ambos grupos recibieron tratamiento durante 15 días. Como medida de los cambios fue utilizado el White Bear Suppression Inventory (WBSI). Fueron encontradas diferencias significativas entre ambos grupos luego de dos semanas de tratamiento, favorables al efecto del WCH sobre el PLA en la reducción de la ThS, con un tamaño de efecto mediano: F (1, 71) = 8. 245, p=. 005 y η 2 p=. 104. Este resultado sugiere que el WCH puede ser efectivo en la reducción del uso de la supresión de pensamientos. Ningún participante reportó reacciones adversas.

40|$|Der inzwischen auf der EPPO A 1 -Liste aufgeführte Quarantäneschädling, der Bockkäfer Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky, 1853), ist seit seiner Einschleppung nach Braunau am Inn (Österreich) im Jahr 2001 in ganz Europa ein Begriff. Neben zwei unabhängigen Fundorten in Frankreich, 2003 in Gien und 2004 in Sainte-Anne-sur-Brivet (Hérard & al. 2005) wurde eine Freiland-Population dieser Laubbäume schädigenden Art erstmals 2004 auch in Deutschland festgestellt. Bisherige Funde von Käfern in Deutschland waren auf das Gelände des Hamburger Hafens, Umschlagplatz vieler Container aus dem asiatischen Raum, beschränkt (Schliesske 2001). Es konnte aber nie eine Übersiedelung auf Laubbäume in der Umgebung beobachtet werden. Die Situation änderte sich gravierend, als offensichtlich befallene Bäume in Neukirchen am Inn (Gemeinde Neuburg am Inn, Landkreis Passau) in Bayern festgestellt wurden. Symptome wie mangelnde Belaubung, kraterförmige Eiablagestellen und Austritt von Bohrmehl an einem Ahornbaum deuteten auf Befall mit A. glabripennis hin. Nach Entnahme von Astteilen wurden in Gängen Bockkäfer-Larven gefunden, die von Kollegen des Bundesamtes und Forschungszentrums für Wald (BFW) in Wien mittels DNA-Analyse zweifelsfrei als A. glabripennis identifiziert wurden (Hoyer & al. 2003). Since the {{introduction}} of Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky, 1853) to Neukirchen/Inn, a small village in the rural district Passau, in 2004, considerable {{efforts were made to}} eradicate this quarantine pest in Bavaria. This longicorn species mainly infested deciduous trees of urban areas in Neukirchen/Inn. The centre where the infestation started was the graveyard at the outskirts of the town. Into the forestal area, which is about two kilometres away, the population of A. glabripennis couldn’t yet extend. Over the last three years the following taxa of deciduous trees were detected as a host plant of A. glabripennis in Bavaria: Acer spp. (maple), Betula spp. (birch), Aesculus hippocastanum (<b>white</b> <b>chestnut),</b> Salix spp. (willow) and Populus spp. (poplar). At the moment the only way of controlling A. glabripennis seems to be a permanent monitoring in the infested area. For reaching this aim potentially host trees, which show symptoms of infestation, will be cut down, chaffed and burned – also only in the case of suspicion. When in 2004 altogether 16 trees and in the following year only two trees were removed the infestation seemed hopefully to be cleared. But in the middle of October 2005 many egg deposition sites could be found on several maple trees in the graveyard. For reasons of precaution 49 trees were cut in January 2006. The growing season in 2006 almost confirmed the 1 ½ to 2 -year generation cycle of A. glabripennis which is assumed by experts for Central Europe. After the nearly uneventful year 2005 again ten trees in the surrounding of the graveyard showed conspicuous symptoms. Furthermore exit holes of adult beetles could be detected. The trees immediately were removed. The eradication measures and the monitoring in Neukirchen/Inn have to be continued in the following years...|$|E
