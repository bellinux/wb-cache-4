2500|$|As always, {{the league}} {{considered}} several potential host cities before choosing the Phoenix area. In this case, the process drew special interest because the league considered holding Super Bowl XLII in New York City or Washington, D.C. {{as a symbol}} of the recovery from the September 11 attacks. New York City's bid did not go far. Aside from the obvious climatic concerns, it was also difficult to find a suitable stadium. Proposed renovations to the 1970s-vintage Giants Stadium were still being disputed amongst the various parties. Giants Stadium also lacked a roof, as did both of New York City's baseball stadiums, and the NFL had never played an outdoor Super Bowl in a cold <b>weather</b> <b>climate.</b> The city of New York and the New York Jets failed to secure a deal to build a new West Side Stadium (which, according to the initial plans, would have been built with a roof). [...] During the years since the Super Bowl XLII bid fell through, Giants Stadium has been demolished. Its replacement, MetLife Stadium, was awarded Super Bowl XLVIII.|$|E

40|$|Chapter 3 evaluates {{observed}} and projected {{changes in the}} frequency, intensity, spatial extent, and duration of extreme <b>weather</b> and <b>climate</b> events. This physical basis provides a picture of climate change and extreme events. But it does not by itself indicate the impacts experienced by humans or ecosystems. For example, for some sectors and groups of people, severe impacts may result from relatively minor <b>weather</b> and <b>climate</b> events. To understand impacts triggered by <b>weather</b> and <b>climate</b> events, the exposure and vulnerability of humans and ecological systems need to be examined. The emphasis of this chapter is on negative impacts, {{in line with this}} report&# 039;s focus on managing the risks of extreme events and disasters. <b>Weather</b> and <b>climate</b> events, however, can and often do have positive impacts for some people and ecosystems. In this chapter, two different types of impacts on human and ecological systems are examined: (i) impacts of extreme <b>weather</b> and <b>climate</b> events; and (ii) extreme impacts triggered by less-than-extreme <b>weather</b> or <b>climate</b> events (in combination with non-climatic factors, such as high exposure and/or vulnerability). Where data are available, impacts are examined from sectoral and regional perspectives. Throughout this chapter, the term &# 039;climate extremes&# 039; will be used to refer in brief to &# 039;extreme <b>weather</b> and extreme <b>climate</b> events&# 039; as defined in the Glossary and discussed more extensively in Section 3. 1. 2...|$|R

Just as atmospheric models can, and do, differ between <b>weather</b> and <b>climate</b> applications, mostly related to issues of scale, resolved or parameterised physics,and computational requirements, so too can the land models that provide the required surface fluxes differ between <b>weather</b> and <b>climate</b> models. Here, however, the issue is less one of scale-dependent parameterisations. Computational demands can influence other minor land model differences, especially with respect to initialisation, data assimilation, and forecast skill.

What other possibilities exist if we consider weather and seasons that include non-human perspectives? What are the implications of these ways of thinking?

40|$|Challenges in linking {{meteorological}} and climatological {{information with}} a wide range of farming decisions are addressed in this paper. In particular, while a considerable amount of <b>weather</b> and <b>climate</b> information is now available for farmers, some types of information under development or already operational, particularly climate forecasting, may be ill-suited for use by farmers for their decision-making. Case studies show it is particularly important for those key farm decisions that are amenable to <b>weather</b> and <b>climate</b> information to be identified clearly so that <b>weather</b> and <b>climate</b> information can be better tailored to suit farming decisions. A participatory approach provides farmers with ownership of the processes associated with development of <b>weather</b> and <b>climate</b> information and forecasts to farm decisions. Decision-support systems provide useful output when used with farmer discussion groups. Developing appropriate interdisciplinary systems to connect <b>climate,</b> <b>weather</b> and agronomic information, especially including forecasting systems, with farm management is needed if uptake of <b>weather</b> and <b>climate</b> information by farmers is to be successful. provision of output of climate change scenario and trend information to aid long-term strategic farm management decisions needs to be considered, especially in regions where more vulnerable farming zones exist...|$|R

However, <b>weather</b> and <b>climate</b> modification is a purposeful process and, therefore, we can formulate operations to manipulate <b>weather</b> and <b>climate</b> as the optimization problem {{within the framework of}} the optimal control theory. The complexity of the earth’s climate system is discussed and illustrated using the simplified low-order coupled chaotic dynamical system. The necessary conditions of optimality are derived for the large-scale atmospheric dynamics. This confirms that even a relatively simplified control problem for the atmospheric dynamics requires significant efforts to obtain the solution...|$|R
40|$|Tourism is {{inherently}} dependent on <b>weather</b> and <b>climate,</b> and its sustainability and resilience to adverse <b>weather</b> and <b>climate</b> impacts is greatly enhanced by providing tailored climate services to tourism sector stakeholders. Climate services need to integrate standard weather forecasts, with early warning systems, seasonal forecasts, and long-term projections of climatic changes {{in order to}} meet the information needs of the sector. While a growing number of studies address the potential climate change impacts on tourism, little is known about how the tourism sector accesses, uses, and analyses the available <b>weather</b> and <b>climate</b> information. This research presents findings from an exploratory study on <b>weather</b> and <b>climate</b> information-seeking behavior of 15 private and public tourism sector stakeholders in the Republic of Fiji. The results show a variety of <b>weather</b> and <b>climate</b> information-seeking paths in use, which differ depending on levels of professional responsibility, <b>weather</b> and <b>climate</b> literacy, and information and digital competency. Those with high weather information literacy access a broader variety of sources. Hence, their interpretation does not focus only on their own location, but “weather” is seen as a broad spatial phenomenon that might or might not result in adverse effects in their location. Understanding diverse <b>weather</b> and <b>climate</b> information-seeking paths can aid in better targeting climate and adaptation services across different stakeholder groups. Especially in the context of small island developing states (SIDS), the integration of traditional, local, and scientific knowledge as information sources is likely to provide a more useful and context-specific basis for climate adaptation planning within the sector.
