2500|$|The game, {{while in}} early access, has already {{received}} alternate gameplay modes created by players, determined by unenforceable rules that players agree to abide by, {{that have been}} popular with streamers. This was aided by a quiet release of custom server support {{to a number of}} influential streamers which subsequently made it into public release. In one case, [...] "Zombie Mode", all but four players pretend to be zombies, who may sometimes distinguish themselves by removing all clothing and are limited only to collecting melee weapons and consumable items, and must rush to attack the other four players, who are able to collect all gear and attempt to outrun and defeat the zombies. Inspired by this mode, Greene announced plans to introduce an official zombie-based gameplay mode based on this into Battlegrounds. Whereas {{most of the rest of}} the team continued to develop the core gameplay and maps, Greene is taking on the zombie mode as a near solo project, only using the assistance of the lead animator to help with the zombie animations. Greene sees Battlegrounds as a platform, and <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>more</b> custom game types and mods developed by players for it. Greene identified that some mods that he also previously worked on from ARMA 3 may become part of the Battlegrounds platform.

6000|$|The court then arose, and the {{audience}} departed, greatly wondering at the talent displayed by Alan Fairford at his first appearance in a case so difficult and so complicated, and assigning a hundred conjectural causes, each different from the others, for the singular interruption which had clouded his day of success.
