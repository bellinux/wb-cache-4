40|$|Background: <b>Neck</b> {{pain and}} <b>injury</b> {{are common in}} rugby union. Physical {{characteristics}} predisposing players to <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> are largely unknown. This study aimed to determine physical characteristics associated with <b>neck</b> pain and <b>injury</b> in rugby union players. Methods: Semi-professional rugby union players (n= 142) underwent pre-season measurements including cervical active range of motion (AROM), strength, sensorimotor proprioception (joint position error), and anthropometry. A structured interview established previous <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> history, current symptoms, playing position, competition level, age, and years playing rugby. Team physiotherapists and player telephone interviews identified players sustaining a <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> during the competitive season (defined as any reported neck pain or <b>neck</b> <b>injury).</b> T-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests determined differences between neck injured and non-injured players. Logistic regression determined factors associated with <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> history and incidence. Results: Sixty-five (46 %) players reported a previous neck injury; 11 (8 %) sustained a <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> during the competitive season. Player age (OR 1. 14, 95 % CI 1. 03 - 1. 25, p=. 009) was associated with <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> history. Pre-season lateral flexion AROM was less in players sustaining a <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> or reporting <b>neck</b> pain during the season (median left 23. 6 °, IQR 21. 8 °- 26. 2 °; right 27. 9 °, 23. 6 °- 32. 5 °) than in other players (left 34. 8 °, 28. 8 °- 41. 0 °, p<. 01; right 39. 1 °, 28. 9 °- 48. 1 °, p= 0. 03). Lateral flexion AROM was associated with increased risk of <b>neck</b> pain or <b>injury</b> (OR 0. 82, 95 %CI 0. 71 - 0. 94, p= 0. 005). Conclusions: Decreased cervical lateral flexion AROM may contribute to <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> risk in rugby union players. However, few physical characteristics predicted <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> incidence, suggesting additional factors should be explored to determine injury risk...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} gain more {{knowledge}} of the <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> scenario in frontal impacts, a statistical study of parameters influencing incidences of AIS 1 <b>neck</b> <b>injuries</b> was performed. The data set consisted of 616 occupants in Volvo cars. Information regarding the crash, the safety systems, occupant characteristics (including prior neck problems), behavior and sitting posture {{at the time of}} impact, and neck symptoms (including duration) was collected and analyzed. Occupant characteristics (mainly gender, weight, and age), kinematics (head impacts) and behavior at the time of impact were identified as the most prominent parameter areas with regard to AIS 1 <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> outcome. Specifically, women had a significantly higher AIS 1 <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> rate as compared to men, occupants under the age of 50 had a significantly higher AIS 1 <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> rate as compared to those above 50 and occupants weighing less than 65 kg have a significantly higher AIS 1 <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> rate than heavier occupants. Drivers stating that they impacted their head against a frontal interior structure had a significantly higher AIS 1 <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> rate than those without head impact. Also, occupants who stated they had tensed their neck muscles at the time of impact, had a significantly higher AIS 1 <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> rate as compared to occupants who did not. Occupant activities, such as tightly gripping the steering wheel or straightening their arms showed a significantly increased AIS 1 <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> rate, indicating that occupant behavior at time of impact could be influential with respect to AIS 1 <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> outcome. Also, occupants reporting prior neck problems had a higher rate of persistent symptoms (> 1 year) but no difference with respect to passing symptoms (< 3 months) as compared to those without prior neck problems. Additionally, there was no distinct pattern for the duration of neck symptoms...|$|R

"A systematic {{review of the literature}} on <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> in Rugby Union has uncovered variations in the definition of sports injury and the design of studies which has resulted in our current limited understanding on this subject. There is a paucity of data on the severity of sports injuries and little analytical data to confirm any causal relationship between risk factors and <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> in Rugby Union. Therefore a prospective cohort study was undertaken to analyse the incidence, severity, aetiology and type of <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> in amateur men's Rugby Union. In 31140 hours of play (12860 hours of match time and 18280 hours of training) 90 participants (n = 262) sustained <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> (8 were recurrent). The incidence rate of <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> was 2. 9 injuries / 1000 player-hours (95 % CI: 2. 3, 3. 6). Sixty-nine point three percent of <b>neck</b> <b>injuries</b> were minor, 17 % mild, 6. 8 % moderate and 6. 8 % severe. Neck compression was the most frequent mechanism of injury and was found to be weakly associated with severity (P = 0. 073). Cervical facet injury was the most frequent type of <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> diagnosis. There was a significant relationship between the incidence of <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> and pain reported during pre-season screening. A weak association was found between the incidence of <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> and the players' age, stage of career and previous <b>neck</b> <b>injury.</b> A weak association between the severity of injury and {{the amount of time spent}} on pre-season preparation was also present.

40|$|Abstract Background There is {{a paucity}} of {{epidemiological}} data on <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> in amateur rugby union populations. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the incidence, severity, aetiology and type of <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> in Australian men's amateur rugby union. Methods Data was collected from a cohort of 262 participants from two Australian amateur men's rugby union clubs via a prospective cohort study design. A modified version of the Rugby Union Injury Report Form for Games and Training was used by the clubs physiotherapist or chiropractor in data collection. Results The participants sustained 90 (eight recurrent) <b>neck</b> <b>injuries.</b> Exposure time was calculated at 31143. 8 hours of play (12863. 8 hours of match time and 18280 hours of training). Incidence of <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> was 2. 9 injuries/ 1000 player-hours (95 %CI: 2. 3, 3. 6). As a consequence 69. 3 % <b>neck</b> <b>injuries</b> were minor, 17 % mild, 6. 8 % moderate and 6. 8 % severe. Neck compression was the most frequent aetiology and was weakly associated with severity. Cervical facet injury was the most frequent <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> type. Conclusions This is the first prospective cohort study in an amateur men's rugby union population since the inception of professionalism that presents injury rate, severity, aetiology and injury type data for <b>neck</b> <b>injury.</b> Current epidemiological data should be sought when evaluating the risks associated with rugby union football. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{review of}} a few Swedish {{research}} projects on soft tissue <b>neck</b> <b>injuries</b> in car collisions is presented together with some new results. Efforts to determine <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> mechanisms {{was based on a}} hypothesis stating that injuries to the nerve root region in the cervical spine are a result of transient pressure gradients in the spinal canal during rapid neck bending. In experimental neck trauma research on animals, pressure gradients were observed and indications of nerve cell membrane dysfunction were found in the cervical spinal ganglia. The experiments covered neck extension, flexion and lateral bending. A theoretical model in which fluid flow was predicted to cause the transient pressure gradients was developed and a <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> criterion based on Navier-Stokes Equations was applied on the flow model. The theory behind the <b>Neck</b> <b>Injury</b> Criterion indicates that the <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> occurs early on in the rearward motion of the head relative to the torso in a rear-end collision. Thus the relative horizontal acceleration and velocity between the head and the torso should be restricted during the early head-neck motion to avoid <b>neck</b> <b>injury.</b> A Bio-fidelic Rear Impact Dummy (BioRID) was developed in several steps and validated against volunteer test results. The new dummy was partly based on the Hybrid III dummy. It had a new articulated spine with curvature and range of motion resembling that of a human being. A new crash dummy and a <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> criterion will be very important components in a future rear-impact crash test procedure...|$|R

40|$|Although head {{restraints}} became mandatory {{in several countries}} during the 1960 s and 1970 s, the number of <b>neck</b> <b>injuries</b> is still rising, which indicates that current {{head restraints}} are not giving sufficient protection. Despite numerous epidemiological and parameter studies, there are no methods to estimate in advance the potential <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> risk reduction {{as a result of}} a better positioned head restraint. The purpose of this study is to assess the influence of the head restraints on the long-term AIS I <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> risk for real-life crash conditions. Madymo simulations of rear-end crashes were performed. The BioRID II seated in three car models was exposed to 20 recorded crash pulses with the potential to cause <b>neck</b> <b>injuries.</b> For each crash pulse, 132 head restraint positions were analysed in terms of NICmax value and long-term AIS I <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> risk. It was found that the optimal head restraint position for almost all crashes was that with zero backset and the top of the head restraint at the same level as the top of the head. In general, the NICmax and the injury risk were primarily influenced by the backset and only to a small extent by the head-to-head-restraint height; the <b>neck</b> <b>injury</b> risk was reduced by 0. 1 for every 2. 5 cm decrease of the backset.
