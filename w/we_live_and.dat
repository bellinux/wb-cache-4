500|$|Pernick and Wilder explain that, in the 1970s, clean {{technology}} was considered “alternative,” {{the province of}} back-to-the-land lifestyle advocates, altruistic environmentalists, and lab scientists on research grants. [...] Such technology was in {{an early stage of}} development, was too expensive, it did not have widespread political support, and very few large, established companies were embracing the sector. Even {{at the start of the}} 21st century, the term clean tech was not yet in the financial or business community’s vocabulary. But now, throughout much of the world, in trends large and small, there is [...] "the beginning of a revolution that is changing the places where <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>and</b> work, the products we manufacture and purchase, and the development plans of cities, regional governments, and nations around the globe." ...|$|E

It follows a simple chord progression of G-D-A-Bm. Monica Herrera of Billboard noted that lines such as [...] "So we fight through the hurt, and we cry and cry and cry and cry/ Then <b>we</b> <b>live</b> <b>and</b> we learn, and we try" [...] revealed a [...] "deeper side" [...] to the singer.

Gore responded that [...] "The entire global scientific community has a consensus on the question that human beings are responsible for global warming and he [...] has today again expressed personal doubt that that is true."

EMI claimed that the band had failed to produce {{three of the five}} records they were obligated to deliver under their 1999 contract, which Virgin entered into with the now-defunct Immortal Records.

500|$|Vlastimil Koubek (March 17, 1927 – February 15, 2003) was a Czech American {{architect}} who designed more than 100 buildings, {{most of them}} in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. When he died, he had designed buildings worth more than $2 billion. Most of his work is Modernist in style, although he developed a few structures in other vernaculars.

[...] A spokesman for 10:10 also denied that the withdrawal had been planned from the beginning in order to generate publicity. After removing the video from YouTube, 10:10 issued a statement: [...] "We won't be making any attempt to censor or remove other versions currently in circulation on the internet".
