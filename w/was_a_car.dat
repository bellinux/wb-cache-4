25|$|Exocentric {{compounds}} occur {{more often}} in adjectives than nouns. <b>A</b> V-8 <b>car</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> with <b>a</b> V-8 engine rather than <b>a</b> <b>car</b> that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> V-8, and <b>a</b> twenty-five-dollar <b>car</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> with <b>a</b> worth of $25, not <b>a</b> <b>car</b> that <b>is</b> $25.

25|$|This {{model was}} sold as the Nissan Pintara in Australia, {{replacing}} a larger Skyline-based model, from 1989 to 1993.

In Japan, a four-door sedan and four-door hardtop were offered, although Nissan of Australia did create a five-door Pintara 'Superhatch' model that was sold as the Bluebird in some export markets, including New Zealand. It was marketed as the 'Bluebird Aussie' in Japan, selling complete with a fluffy little koala, Aussie flag under the clock and other small touches.|$|E

Mohamed Osman Mohamud, a Somali-American student, was arrested after attempting to set off what he thought <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> bomb at a Christmas tree lighting ceremony. It turned out the bomb was inert and was part of an FBI sting operation. He was charged with attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. In October 2014, Mohamud was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison along with credit for time served since his arrest, as well as lifetime supervision upon his scheduled release in 2037.|$|E
25|$|TVR {{received}} some positive publicity when Autocar magazine dedicated three pages in its March 1959 issue to a technical {{description of the}} Grantura Mk1. Unfortunately, the company continued to struggle with the rate of production, still only able to build about one car per month. With the order backlog having grown to around fifteen cars {{by the end of}} March, the board voted to replace Trevor Wilkinson with Henry Moulds as the new production manager. Moulds <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> enthusiast and friend of Bunty Scott-Moncrieff. Wilkinson would remain involved with the company, although his influence had been diminished by the appointment of Moulds as the new manager.|$|E
25|$|The Omagh bombing <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> {{bombing that}} took place on 15 August 1998 in Omagh, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. It {{was carried out by}} a group calling {{themselves}} the Real Irish Republican Army, a Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) splinter group who opposed the IRA's ceasefire and the Good Friday Agreement. The bombing killed 29 people (including a woman pregnant with twins) and injured some 220 others, a death toll even higher than that of any single incident during what were considered 'the Troubles' (1968-10 April 1998). Telephoned warnings had been sent about 40 minutes beforehand, but were claimed to be inaccurate and police had inadvertently moved people towards the bomb.|$|E

25|$|Puerto Ricans became U.S. {{citizens}} {{as a result}} of the 1917 Jones-Shafroth Act and those who were eligible, with the exception of women, were expected to serve in the military, either voluntarily or {{as a result of}} the military draft (conscription). In 1948, Cancel Miranda, then eighteen and in high school, refused to be drafted into the military. One day, he was walking to school in San Juan with other students, and there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> with four FBI agents at the corner of his house. He handed his books to the other students to take them to the place where he was living. The men arrested him and charged him with refusing the U.S. draft. The U.S. Federal Court in Puerto Rico sentenced him to two years and one day and he was sent to a prison in Tallahassee, Florida, where he remained from 1949 to 1951. During his stay in prison he confronted a prison guard because of the racist segregation inside prison walls. Under Jim Crow legislation at the time, the prison dormitories were segregated.|$|E
25|$|The {{time machine}} went through several {{variations}} during {{production of the}} first film, Back to the Future. In {{the first draft of}} the screenplay, the time machine was a laser device that was housed in a room. At {{the end of the first}} draft the device was attached to a refrigerator and taken to an atomic bomb test site. Director Robert Zemeckis said in an interview that the idea was scrapped because he did not want children to start climbing into refrigerators and getting trapped inside. In the third draft of the film the time machine <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>car,</b> as Zemeckis reasoned that if you were going to make a time machine, you would want it to be mobile. The specific choice of vehicle was a DeLorean DMC-12 for the purposes of it looking like an alien spaceship due to its characteristic gullwing doors (which were inspired by the Mercedes-Benz 300 SL). However, in order to send Marty back to the future, the vehicle had to drive into a nuclear test site. Ultimately this concept was considered too expensive to film, so the power source was changed to lightning.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the scenes}} in Monk's Cafe were filmed at the CBS Studio Center, the {{exterior}} of Tom's Restaurant, a diner at Broadway and 112th Street in Manhattan {{was used as the}} exterior for the cafe. The second scene of the episode, which takes place on a street, was filmed on CBS Studio Center's [...] "New York Street", a set that consists of four very small store fronts. During seasons one to five, [...] "New York Street" [...] was the only set the writers could use to replicate New York City. This scene, and additional scenes which take place in Jerry's car, were filmed on October 22 from 5:00 to 8:30p.m. One or two members of the crew shook the car {{to give the impression that}} it was moving, though it never actually was. Other crew members would move lights around the set to simulate street lights or headlights of other cars. Behind the car, two lights on a wheeled stand were placed to give the impression that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> behind it. This technique is called [...] "poor man's process", because it is cheaper than other ways of achieving the effect. The show had previously experimented with this technique in the season one episode [...] "The Stake Out".|$|E
500|$|... "The Baby Shower" [...] {{was first}} {{read by the}} show's cast on November 14, 1990. It was filmed {{in front of a}} live {{audience}} on November 20. A technique called [...] "Poor Man's Process" [...] was used during the car scene with George and Jerry; one or two crew members would shake the car {{to give the impression that}} it was moving, though it never actually was. Other crew members would move lights around the set to simulate street lights or headlights of other cars. Behind the car, two lights on a wheeled stand were placed to give the impression that there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> behind it. A cheap plastic sticker was put on Jerry's television screen to give the impression that it was broken. A number of scenes were changed or cut during production of the episode. In early drafts of the script, the episode opened with Kramer telling Jerry about the Russian cable installers. In the first draft of the script Elaine and Jerry would realize ahead of time that the baby shower and the cable installation would take place at the same time. This was changed as the writers felt it would be better left as a surprise. Some dialogue was removed from the scene, as Kramer initially told Jerry Benjamin Franklin would have wanted free cable. Additional dialogue between the baby shower guests regarding turning off men was also cut. The scene in which Mary Cantardi, a woman Jerry went out with once but never called afterwards, makes a scene at the baby shower was not in the original script, but was added during rehearsals to give Seinfeld more involvement in the final scene.|$|E
500|$|Special {{effects and}} {{pyrotechnics}} {{were provided by}} Pyritz Pyrotechnics Group. Terry Ritz, founder of the organization, and his partner Steve Aleff had created various ideas based on the tour soundtrack that was provided {{to them by the}} Wonder World Tour's personnel. They met with the tour's choreographer, band manager, and lighting designer, asking them to bring their [...] "hopes, wishes, and dreams." [...] Out of these meetings, the show was completed and a lighting crew, who monitored the stage with a four-camera monitor system when cues were executed, was selected. The pyrotechnics for the show were described as more elegant and subtle, being composed of pink flames with accentuation of silver and white glitter. Because of the extensive automation executed throughout the concert, two personnel were in charge of running it. Neville Emerton ran the automation from under the stage, and Sean Conner ran all of the flying moves from a position at the front of each venue. Meanwhile, assistant stage manager Seth Posner called cues for each concert. [...] "Normally, in a rock show you don’t need someone calling the show. In this one we had to take a more theatrical approach with someone calling cues {{every step of the way}} because there was so much going on at once between props and automation", explained production manager Omar Abderrahman. One of the props that required much attention on the part of Posner <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>car</b> made to resemble a tractor, designed and built by effects designer and stage manager Scott [...] "Stryker" [...] Christensen. Because it came along late in the design process, the main elevator was not built to handle the weight of the car, though it was eventually reinforced to support the weight and movement of the car. The car was also modified; it was made electric, instead of using a combustion engine, for fire-safety and changed to turn around by adjusting its turning radius to automate steering with all four wheels. In order to translate the concert tour overseas to the United Kingdom, the Wonder World Tour paired with Sound Moves, a company that was already providing minor support for the North American leg of the tour.|$|E
