25|$|Styling for 1939 {{featured}} a new two-piece “waterfall” grille with thin vertical bars. The hood was narrower, front door pillars were narrower and hubcaps were larger. <b>Window</b> <b>area</b> increased substantially with {{the rear window}} changing to a one-piece design. On the interior all major gauges were moved to {{in front of the}} driver and the gear shift was moved to a column mount. The 4-door phaeton could now be ordered with the built-in trunk appearance or as a fastback, but only three of the later were actually sold. Although prices were reduced (the price of the sedan fell to $1545) sales only rose to 6097, with Roadmaster’s share of Buick’s total sales falling to 2.9 percent.|$|E

2500|$|A highly trimmed, two-door coupe, {{the first}} Regal shared its {{front and rear}} styling with its Century parent with distinctions amounting to differing grilles and {{taillight}} lenses. The Regal shared the same [...] "Colonnade" [...] pillared hardtop roofline (a hardtop with B-pillars (center pillars) but frameless doors unlike a sedan body) and greenhouse (<b>window</b> <b>area)</b> with the Grand Prix, Monte Carlo, and Cutlass Supreme {{as well as the}} lower-priced Buick Century Luxus coupe. Like its corporate cousins, the Regal (and Luxus) featured the newly fashionable opera windows, which were small fixed rear-side windows surrounded by sheetmetal, instead of the traditional roll-down windows.|$|E
2500|$|Assist {{features}} {{are often used}} to help balance asymmetry from non-telecentricity at different slit positions, due to different illumination angles, starting at the 7nm node. However, the asymmetry is reduced but not completely eliminated, since the assist features mainly enhance the highest spatial frequencies, whereas intermediate spatial frequencies, which also affect feature focus and position, are not much affected. The coupling between the primary image and the self images is too strong for the asymmetry to be completely eliminated by assist features; only asymmetric illumination can achieve this. Assist features may also {{get in the way}} of access to power/ground rails. Power rails are expected to be wider, which also limits the effectiveness of using assist features, by constraining the local pitch. Local pitches between 1x and 2x the minimum pitch forbid assist feature placement, as there is simply no room to preserve the local pitch symmetry. In fact, for the application to the two-bar asymmetry case, the optimum assist feature placement may be less than or exceed the two-bar pitch. Depending on the parameter to be optimized (process <b>window</b> <b>area,</b> depth of focus, exposure latitude), the optimum assist feature configuration can be very different, e.g., pitch between assist feature and bar being different from two-bar pitch, symmetric or asymmetric, etc..|$|E
25|$|The {{facade of}} this {{building}} has four Ionic columns, plus a half-column at each end. The main entrance is between the two central columns, and the <b>window</b> <b>areas</b> between the columns are now filled with dark glass.

5000|$|The Petrified Dunes are {{a series}} of rock {{formations}} located in Arches National Park in southeastern Utah, United States. [...] The dunes can be found just off of the park road between the Courthouse Towers and the <b>Windows</b> <b>Area.</b> The formation was produced when ancient sand dunes hardened into stone under the overlying subsequent material, which later eroded away.|$|R
50|$|One of Zomeworks' inventions was the now-expired {{patented}} Beadwall, (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APNIt6Y_E3A) {{which consists}} of two sheets of glass with small styrofoam beads blown {{in the space between}} them by an air pump at night to insulate the <b>window</b> <b>areas</b> of the building (the beads being removed by vacuum action in the morning). The design is somewhat similar to the drum wall.|$|R

50|$|The {{building}} {{was designed to}} make maximum use of daylight, both to provide a bright environment and also to reduce energy consumption. The large <b>window</b> <b>areas</b> and 'sky-lights' in the roof cones provide sufficient natural light for low-energy electric lighting to be kept to a minimum, reducing both energy demands and ambient heat creation. Artificial lighting typically represents around 30% of a building’s energy use.|$|R
5000|$|A {{stacking}} {{window manager}} renders the windows one-by-one {{onto the screen}} at specific co-ordinates. If one <b>window's</b> <b>area</b> overlaps another, then the window [...] "on top" [...] overwrites part of the other's visible appearance. This results in the appearance familiar to many users in which windows act {{a little bit like}} pieces of paper on a desktop, which can be moved around and allowed to overlap.|$|R
50|$|The 12 {{acres of}} formal gardens were {{designed}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century by Simeon Marshall, working for the internationally acclaimed James Backhouses & Sons Nursery. They were inspired by the vision of the owner, George Marples, to create a '1000 shades of green' to be viewed from his bedroom <b>window.</b> <b>Areas</b> of the garden include the Italian Garden, Scented Terrace, Water Garden, Koi Pond, Kitchen Garden and Orangery, amongst others.|$|R
50|$|The Reliance Building's {{move toward}} {{increased}} <b>window</b> <b>area</b> reached its logical conclusion in a New York City {{building with a}} Brazilian architect on land that is technically {{not a part of}} the United States. United Nations headquarters, 1949-1950, by Oscar Niemeyer has the first complete glass curtain wall.|$|E
50|$|Some {{building}} codes also limit {{the percentage of}} <b>window</b> <b>area</b> in exterior walls. When the exterior wall is not rated, the perimeter slab edge becomes a junction where rated slabs are abutting an unrated wall. For rated walls, one may also choose rated windows and fire doors, to maintain that wall's rating.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of travelling mattes and optical printing, double exposure was used to introduce elements into a scene which were not present in the initial exposure. This was done using black draping where a green screen would be used today. George Albert Smith first used this approach in 1898. In 1903, The Great Train Robbery by Edwin S. Porter used double exposure to add background scenes to windows which were black when filmed on set, using a garbage matte to expose only the <b>window</b> <b>areas.</b>|$|R
50|$|The default color sold by {{the company}} was used at the Seoul area {{starting}} in 1977; white with orange horizontal stripes. Other colors were also applied as green with midsection of beige up to near front of the rear wheel with twice alternating colors in oblique angle strip at the bus. The remaining midsection part was matched to the body color. By 1980, some of these buses were painted as white divided with marine blue at the top at the <b>windows</b> <b>area</b> and the bottom horizontal.|$|R

50|$|The {{solution}} is to rotate the window until its long edge {{is parallel to the}} nearby roof line, to better maximize the space available for a window. Thus, not only is the <b>window</b> <b>area</b> (and thus incoming light and ventilation) maximized, but building or buying a custom window is avoided. The window that was removed from the wall may even be re-used.|$|E
50|$|Visitors to {{the church}} are struck by its size and the {{lightness}} of the interior. This lightness {{is due to the}} unusual construction of five aisles, separated by columns and allowing generous <b>window</b> <b>area.</b> The nave is 800 years old and the other aisles have been added over the centuries so that, in its heyday, a congregation of 1100 was regularly accommodated.|$|E

Bridges lead to its entrances. It was built for CBS Research a company worried about its security. Originally the building had few or no windows facing outward and tenants saw the sunlight through atriums and skylights. In the 1970s, after CBS Research left, slit-like <b>window</b> <b>areas</b> were put in the outside walls, letting in some light.|$|R
2500|$|Many of {{the villages}} on the Eden Valley's eastern fell side {{are subject to the}} Helm Wind and Milburn is no exception. The swirling, noisy gusts are a {{frequent}} feature of life in the village. [...] Uttley has written a detailed account {{of the effects of the}} wind and provided a detailed theory of its causes. The wind is experienced when the wind blows from the north-east. Many houses appear to have been constructed with the Helm in mind and <b>window</b> <b>areas</b> in this direction have been kept to a minimum.|$|R
50|$|A mainly blue livery, {{with light}} cream round the <b>window</b> <b>areas</b> and a maroon belt was {{introduced}} for the owner's vehicles {{and over the}} course of 60 years the company would continue as a successful co-operative. Though it was rare for new members to join, many would leave through retirement or ill-health, with their vehicles and shares in the company being sold on to other members. A1 was slow to introduce 'one person operated' buses, and conductors continued on the arterial Ardrossan/Kilmarnock service well into the late 1990s, even under Stagecoach ownership.|$|R
