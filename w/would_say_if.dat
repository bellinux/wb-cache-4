500|$|According to Rhodes, McKinley [...] "spoke {{from the}} front veranda of his house in Canton to many deputations, some of them spontaneous, others {{arranged}} for." [...] Any delegation was welcome in Canton, so long as its leader wrote to McKinley in advance and introduced himself and his group. [...] Delegations ranged up to thousands of people; if possible, delegation leaders were brought to Canton in advance to settle with McKinley what each <b>would</b> <b>say.</b> <b>If</b> this could not be arranged, the delegation was met {{at the train station}} by a McKinley agent, who would greet it and learn what the leader proposed to say in his address. [...] The agent would suggest any fine-tuning necessary to make it fit within campaign themes, and send the information ahead by runner to McKinley, giving him time to prepare his response. [...] The delegations left behind gifts, which were put to use when possible, but four eagles, named [...] "McKinley", [...] "Mark Hanna","Republican", and [...] "Protection", were donated to the local zoo.|$|E
500|$|When {{creating}} {{the character of}} Adam Jensen, DeMarle wanted {{to give him a}} well-defined personality, and this necessitated balancing it with the narrative's player-driven nature. One of the biggest challenges was {{creating the}} various dialogue choices, as she needed to imagine what a character <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>if</b> they were hostile when she might normally portray them as benign. Multiple layers of dialogue were created within these variances to create different atmospheres within the narrative. There was standard dialogue with minor characters, more complex dialogue with major characters in quests, and what DeMarle termed [...] "conversation boss fights", dialogue tied to the gameplay where social skill could help the player reach an objective. When creating characters, the team drew inspiration from the character portrayals in the Metal Gear series. When designing the corporate side, DeMarle particularly cited the backgrounds of Howard Hughes, Richard Branson and Bill Gates as inspiration for the powerful CEO figures in the narrative of Human Revolution. She also noted the way in which corporations had gained greater power than governments in the narrative, something that paralleled political comments on corporate power at the time.|$|E
2500|$|On The Dick Cavett Show in 1981, {{the novelist}} and short-story writer John Cheever was {{asked why he}} did not write book reviews and what he <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>if</b> {{given the chance to}} review Rabbit Is Rich. He replied: ...|$|E

2500|$|In an April 2008 {{article in}} The Guardian, Steven Tsui, {{the head of}} the {{transplant}} team at Papworth Hospital in the UK, is quoted in raising the ethical issue of not holding out false hope. [...] He stated, [...] "Conventionally we <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>if</b> people's life expectancy was a year or less we would consider them a candidate for a heart transplant. But we also have to manage expectations. If we know that in an average year we will do 30 heart transplants, there is no point putting 60 people on our waiting list, because we know half of them will die and it's not right to give them false hope." ...|$|E
2500|$|Interviewed in 2015 by veteran Irish {{broadcaster}} Gay Byrne, Fry {{was asked}} what he <b>would</b> <b>say</b> <b>if</b> he came face-to-face with God. Fry said: [...] "Bone cancer in children, what’s that about? How dare you? How dare you create a world where there is such misery that’s not our fault? It’s utterly, utterly evil. [...] Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid God who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?" [...] Within days, the video was viewed over five million times. Fry later stated he did not refer to any specific religion, and said: [...] "I said quite {{a few things that}} were angry at this supposed God. I was merely saying things that Bertrand Russell and many finer heads of the mind have said for many thousands of years, going {{all the way back to}} the Greeks." [...] Because the God who created this universe, if it was created by God, is quite clearly a maniac, utter maniac.' In May 2017 it was announced that Fry, along with broadcaster RTÉ, were under criminal investigation for blasphemy under the 2009 Defamation Act, following a complaint from a member of the public about the broadcast: the case was dropped after the police confirmed that they had not been able to locate a sufficient number of offended people.|$|E
