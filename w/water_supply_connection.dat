40|$|O presente trabalho tem por finalidade avaliar o volume de ar medido em ligações prediais de água por meio de ensaios de laboratório. Este problema tem gerado várias ações judiciais impetradas pelos consumidores de água, em tramitação na justiça de diversas comarcas brasileiras, que reclamam dos valores cobrados a mais pelos serviços de saneamento em virtude do volume de ar registrado pelos hidrômetros. Devido ao grande interesse pelo tema, este trabalho procura esclarecer alguns pontos desse conflito, por meio de ensaios numa bancada que simula um trecho de rede interligada a um ramal predial. Adicionalmente, foram efetuados testes para avaliar a eficiência e aplicabilidade de válvulas redutoras de ar em ligações prediais, uma vez que a Lei Estadual 12. 645 / 97 permite aos consumidores de água de Minas Gerais a instalação desses equipamentos. Além da avaliação dos aparelhos, verificouse a eficiência de uma ventosa, instalada a montante do ramal predial no ponto mais alto da rede de abastecimento de água. Os resultados obtidos, sob condições normais de abastecimento de água, mostraram que a quantidade de ar na água medida pelos hidrômetros é comparável àquela encontrada na água no meio ambiente. Por outro lado, os resultados dos experimentos com abastecimento de água, logo após esvaziamento da rede interligada ao ramal predial, revelou que o volume de água que chega ao reservatório calibrado está compreendido entre 4 e 9 % do total do volume ar-água registrado pelo hidrômetro, para os experimentos efetuados no intervalo de tempo de teste de 180 s e pressão de 10 mca. Para o mesmo intervalo de tempo, porém com a pressão de 50 mca, o volume de água varia entre 6 e 21 % do volume total registrado pelo hidrômetro. Aumentando-se o intervalo de tempo para 300 s, e mantendo a pressão em 10 mca, o volume de água que efetivamente chega ao reservatório calibrado situa-se entre 7 e 20 % do volume total registrado pelo hidrômetro. Estes resultados evidenciam os erros cometidos pelo hidrômetro ao medir o escoamento bifásico ar e água. Para avaliar a eficiência de aparelhos destinados a reduzir o volume de ar nos ramais prediais, três dispositivos utilizados para reduzir o ar transportado junto com a água foram testados: eliminador de ar, bloqueador de ar e ventosa. Dentre as válvulas testadas, o eliminador de ar apresentou melhor desempenho, em termos de eficiência na retirada de ar, principalmente para as menores vazões. Já o bloqueador de ar, além de possuir desempenho {{inferior}} ao eliminador de ar testado, ao bloquear o ar transportado pela rede de abastecimento pode contribuir para que os bolsões de ar contidos no ramal predial retornem à rede de abastecimento, influenciando assim, no registro de ar por uma outra estrutura de medição próxima. Em relação aos outros aparelhos testados, a ventosa apresentou desempenho inferior ao bloqueador de ar e muito inferior ao desempenho do eliminador de ar. The {{purpose of}} the present work is to evaluate the volume of air measured in domestic <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> pipe <b>connections.</b> It is a current problem as shown by a series of suits running in courts in several cities questioning that the amounts charged by the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> companies might have been increased by air in the water distribution network. Due to the high level of interest generated by the matter, the present work will try to clarify some conflicting points through essays performed in a hydraulic laboratory counter which simulates a part of a distribution pipe connected to a domestic <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> pipe. Additionally, tests were performed to evaluate the efficiency and applicability of air reducing valves in domestic <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>connections,</b> once the Act 12645 / 97 allows Minas Gerais water consumers to have the installation of such equipment. In addition to the evaluation of such devices, the efficiency of air release valves was checked, installed upstream the domestic <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> pipe at the highest point of the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> network. The results obtained under regular <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> conditions showed that the quantity of air in the water measured by the hydrometers is comparable to the one found in the environment water. On the other hand, the <b>water</b> <b>supply,</b> right after emptying the network connected to the domestic <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> pipe, revealed that the volume of water which gets to the gauged reservoir, comprehends 4 % and 9 % of the total air-water volume recorded by the hydrometer for the experiments performed in the test time interval of 180 seconds and a 10 mca pressure. For the same time interval, despite the 50 mca pressure, the volume of water varies from 6 % to 21 % of the total volume recorded by the hydrometer. By increasing the time interval to 300 seconds, and keeping the pressure at 10 mca, the volume of water that effectively gets to the gauged reservoir is between 7 % and 20 % of the total volume recorded by the hydrometer. Such results show clearly the mistakes made by the hydrometer when measuring the twophase outflow of water and air. In order to evaluate the efficiency of the apparatus aimed at reducing the volume of air in the domestic <b>water</b> <b>supply,</b> three devices used to reduce the air carried along with the water were tested: air eliminator, air blocker and air release valve. Among the valves tested, the air eliminator presented the best performance in terms of efficiency in the air withdrawal, especially for the smallest outflow. As to the air blocker, in addition to having a lower performance compared to the tested air eliminator, when blocking the air carried by the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> network it can contribute so as the water pockets contained in the domestic <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> pipe return to the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> network, therefore influencing in the air registration through another measuring structure next to it. Concerning the other apparatus tested, the air release valve has lower performance than the air blocker and a lot lower than the air eliminator performance. As to the apparatus tested air eliminator, for discharges lower than 0. 18 m 3 /h, the efficiency was 91 % and 99 % for pressures 0. 5 MPa and 0. 1 MPa, respectively. The results also revealed that the hydrometer, even after being specified adequately for the consumption measured, in the presence of air, may operate out of the recommended range, causing its mechanism to wear down and mistakes higher than 5 %. The results obtained cannot be generalized for <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> systems and it is still important to take into account that the volume of air measured in the experiments is peculiar of the tests bench. Therefore, as to the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> networks, the volume of water carried into the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> network will depend on the diameter and the pipes length and on the existence or not of devices aimed at eliminating the air out of such networks...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a new spatially-explicit {{analytical}} approach for urban flood risk assessment and generation of climate adaptation capacity metrics for assessing urban community and critical <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> network vulnerability. Using the January 2011 flood in Queensland (Australia) with the core suburbs of Brisbane City as the study area, the research issues with regards to the sufficiency of indicating variables and suitability of climate risk modelling were addressed in this study. A range of geographical variables were analysed using high resolution digital elevation modelling and urban morphological characterisation with 3 D analysis, spatial analysis with fuzzy logic, and geospatial autocorrelation techniques with global Moran's I and Anselin Local Moran's I. The issue on the sufficiency of indicating variables was addressed using the topological cluster analysis of a 2 -dimension self-organising neural network (SONN) structured with 100 neurons and trained by 200 epochs. Furthermore, the suitability of flood risk modeling was addressed by aggregating the indicating variables with weighted overlay and modified fuzzy gamma overlay operations using the joint conditional probability weights based on Bayesian theory. Variable weights were assigned to address the limitations of normative (equal weights) and deductive (expert judgment) approaches. The analyses showed that 186 ha (8 %) and 221 ha (10 %) of the study area were exposed to very high flood risk and very low adaptation capacity, respectively. Ninety percent (90 %) of the study area revealed negative adaptation capacity metrics (- 31 to < 0) which implies that the resources are not enough to increase climate resiliency of the urban community and critical infrastructure (i. e. <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> network). This scenario was further exacerbated by the findings that government infrastructures in Queensland were uncovered by flood insurance. In the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> network vulnerability assessment, eight (8) out of 107 critical trunk-reticulation main connection points were assessed as highly vulnerable critical <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> assets. Furthermore, utility network analysis showed that turbid water may flow along 246 km of pressure main lines (i. e. trunk and reticulation mains) covering the north east to north west sides of the study area. In the absence of immediate mitigation measures, increased risk of fluvial flooding to <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> may significantly impacted the health conditions of urban residents. The newly developed spatially-explicit analytical technique, identified in this study as the flood risk-adaptation capacity index/metrics-adaptation strategies (FRACIAS) linkage model, will allow the integration of flood risk and climate adaptation assessments which have been treated separately in the past. This study provides a tool of high level analyses (e. g. building floor space, <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> <b>connections,</b> etc.) and identifies adaptation strategies to enable urban communities and the <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> industry to better prepare and mitigate future flood events. Furthermore, the results generated from the model can be used to improve insurance and land-use planning policies. These include the deliberation of risk-based premium pricing of flood insurance that should not heavily based on the geographic location of risk but should also take into consideration the adaptation capacity (e. g. income, severe disability, poor access to emergency services, etc.) of the community at risk. Through this approach, the governments (i. e. local, state, and federal) may provide financial and development support to areas of very high flood risk and very low adaptation capacity; thereby strengthening public-private partnership. As precaution, insurance policies may not be used solely as a decision tool for urban development on areas of very high flood risk but also consider the poor land-use planning inherited from the past. Further disaster risk reduction measures identified in this study include the 'flood proofing' of residential houses and commercial buildings, implementation of 'property buy-back' scheme and 'land swap' program, and amendment of Queensland Development Code to regulate the construction of buildings on areas identified with very high flood risk and very low adaptation capacity. ...|$|R

40|$|Approximately {{one million}} people in the UK are served by private <b>water</b> <b>supplies</b> (PWS) where main {{municipal}} <b>water</b> <b>supply</b> system <b>connection</b> is not practical or where PWS is the preferred option. Chronic exposure to contaminants in PWS may have adverse effects on health. South West England is an area with elevated arsenic concentrations in groundwater and over 9000 domestic dwellings here are supplied by PWS. There remains uncertainty as to the extent of the population exposed to arsenic (As), and the factors predicting such exposure. We describe a hazard assessment model based on simplified geology with the potential to predict exposure to As in PWS. Households with a recorded PWS in Cornwall were recruited {{to take part in a}} water sampling programme from 2011 to 2013. Bedrock geologies were aggregated and classified into nine Simplified Bedrock Geological Categories (SBGC), plus a cross-cutting “mineralized” area. PWS were sampled by random selection within SBGCs and some 508 households volunteered for the study. Transformations of the data were explored to estimate the distribution of As concentrations for PWS by SBGC. Using the distribution per SBGC, we predict the proportion of dwellings that would be affected by high concentrations and rank the geologies according to hazard. Within most SBGCs, As concentrations were found to have log-normal distributions. Across these areas, the proportion of dwellings predicted to have drinking water over the prescribed concentration value (PCV) for As ranged from 0 % to 20 %. From these results, a pilot predictive model was developed calculating the proportion of PWS above the PCV for As and hazard ranking supports local decision making and prioritization. With further development and testing, this can help local authorities predict the number of dwellings that might fail the PCV for As, based on bedrock geology. The model presented here for Cornwall could be applied in areas with similar geologies. Application of the method requires independent validation and further groundwater-derived PWS sampling on other geological formations...|$|R
