5|$|In 1983, Carter {{began dating}} Dori Pierson, {{whom he had}} met through a cousin of hers <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> at Surfing Magazine. Pierson's {{connections}} at Walt Disney Studios led to chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg hiring Carter on a standard contract. Carter began writing television films for the studio, penning The B.R.A.T. Patrol in 1986 and Meet the Munceys in 1988. These scripts led to Carter being associated with contemporary youth comedy at the studio, and although he enjoyed the work he felt that his real strengths and interests lay in serious drama instead.|$|E
5|$|Khrushchev {{assisted}} in the purge of many friends and colleagues in Moscow oblast. Of 38top Party officials in Moscow city and province, 35 were killed—the three survivors were transferred {{to other parts of}} the USSR. Of the 146Party secretaries of cities and districts outside Moscow city in the province, only 10 survived the purges. In his memoirs, Khrushchev noted that almost everyone <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> was arrested. By Party protocol, Khrushchev was required to approve these arrests, and did little or nothing to save his friends and colleagues.|$|E

5|$|Hewett {{suspended}} {{his research}} during Judd's 1924–27 excavation of Pueblo Bonito, {{financed by the}} National Geographic Society, but returned to Chetro Ketl in 1929 with graduate students from his newly founded Department of Archaeology and Anthropology at the University of New Mexico. He studied the canyon until 1935, and several Chaco scholars worked for or with him during this period, including Gordon Vivian (father of R. Gwinn Vivian), Edwin Ferdon, Paul Reiter, and Florence M. Hawley. Hewett's methods have been widely criticized, and his work judged to have been substandard, particularly {{in comparison to the}} work done by the National Geographic Project. He spent several years excavating Chetro Ketl, but never published a detailed account of his research there. Despite this, much is known about his studies from the theses and dissertations written by students <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

25|$|Before {{his death}} he was officially {{identified}} only as Glavny Konstruktor (Главный Конструктор), or the Chief Designer, {{to protect him}} from possible cold war assassination attempts by the United States.

25|$|Schuldiner's primary guitar {{throughout}} {{most of his career}} was the B.C.

Most of Schuldiner's sound came from a DiMarzio X2N pickup placed in the bridge. During the (In)Human Tour of the World (1991–92), Schuldiner briefly endorsed a small Wisconsin custom guitar company called Axtra, <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> on designs, though he still insisted on using his BC Rich during filming of the Lack of Comprehension video in September 1991 in Orlando.|$|E
25|$|Historian Teodoro Agoncillo gives a differing {{version of}} events, writing that Patiño {{revealed}} {{the secrets of}} the society to his sister, Honoria, following on a misunderstanding with Apolonio de la Cruz, another society member <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> in the Spanish-owned Diario de Manila periodical. Honoria, an orphanage inmate, was upset at the news and informed Sor Teresa, the orphanage madre portera, who suggested that Patiño tell all to Father Mariano Gil. On August 19, Patiño told Father Mariano what he knew of the secret society. Father Mariano and the owner of the Diario de Manila searched the printing shop, discovering the lithographic stone used to print pring Katipunan receipts. After this discovery the locker of Policarpio Turla, whose signature appeared on the receipts, was forced open and found to contain a dagger, the rules of the society, and other pertinent documents. These were turned over to the police, leading to the arrest and conviction on charges of illegal association and treason of some 500 prominent men.|$|E
25|$|In the miniseries Ultron Forever, the Vision and Black Widow of {{the present}} are drawn into the future by {{what appears to be}} Doctor Doom to join a team of Avengers from various points in the team's history, {{including}} an early Hulk, James Rhodes as Iron Man, Thor when he was afflicted by the curse of Hela, the female Thor {{of the present}}, and Danielle Cage from a future where she wields Captain America's shield. 'Doom' claims that he brought this team together to assist him in defeating Ultron's conquest of the world. Although Doom's true plan is revealed at the story's conclusion to be a desire to take Ultron's place, after the Avengers are able to free the Asgardians to assist them against Ultron's former drones, the Vision reveals that this Doom is actually the Doombot <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> in the Avengers A.I., convincing the Doombot to abandon his plan by noting that simply following Doom's example ignores the more positive aspects of Doom's history as the man who refused to let anyone else dictate his terms.|$|E

25|$|To those <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> at Bazaar, the {{pinnacle}} of Brodovitch's career as a designer was the unfailing elegance of his pages. This elegance, combined with an element of innovation was the ideal mix for a fashion magazine. The quality that guaranteed his success was his devotion to the new, unending surprise and vitality. Frances MacFadden, Bazaars managing editor for much of Brodovitch's tenure, explained his working method:It was a pleasure to watch him work. He was so swift and sure. In emergencies, like the time the Clipper bearing {{the report of the}} Paris Collections was held up in Bermuda, his speed was dazzling. A quick splash or two on the cutting board, a minute's juggling of the photostats, a slather of art gum, and the sixteen pages were complete. His layouts, of course, were the despair of copywriters whose cherished tone poems on girdles or minks had to be sacrificed to his sacred white space. Just before we went to press, all the layouts were laid out in sequence on Carmel Snow's floor, and there, under his eye, re-arranged until the rhythm of the magazine suited him.|$|E
25|$|Of all {{the architects}} {{associated}} with Blacket, {{the one who}} would become most famous was John Horbury Hunt, <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> from 1863 to 1868. It was at this time, that Blacket's architecture developed bolder forms, based upon Norman, Transitional and Early French Gothic architecture, rather than the more refined Gothic. This is particularly noticeable in the presence of simple round windows divided by four circles of tracery in the gables of several churches of this time. Blacket permitted his staff to enter competitions, and it was while at Blacket's office that Horbury Hunt won the commission for Newcastle Cathedral, to be executed in his preferred material of brick. The brick church at Tumut, consecrated in 1873, is ascribed to Blacket, but appears to owe much to Hunt. Hunt, who lived most of his early life in North America, had previously worked under Edward Clarke Cabot. One of the innovations that he introduced to Australian architecture while working for Blacket was the saw-tooth roof for industrial building, which was employed at Mort's Woolstore. Hunt appears to have been influenced by the Arts and Crafts Movement, particularly Philip Webb, and ultimately he created buildings of great originality such as the Anglican Cathedrals of Grafton and Armidale.|$|E
500|$|Justice Harlan {{is remembered}} by people, <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> for his {{tolerance}} and civility.

500|$|The {{end of the}} Civil War meant new {{opportunities}} for the men in Morgan's Republican machine, including Arthur.

The Willinghams as a team wrote the screenplays for Gunpoint as well the script for Murphy's last starring lead in a western 40 Guns to Apache Pass [...] Released through Columbia Pictures in May 1967, the storyline centered around Murphy's character retrieving a cache of stolen rifles sold to Apache leader Cochise.|$|E
500|$|As Chaplin was not {{a trained}} musician, he could not read sheet music and needed the help of {{professional}} composers, such as David Raksin, Raymond Rasch and Eric James, when creating his scores. Musical directors were employed to oversee the recording process, such as Alfred Newman for City Lights. Although some critics have claimed that credit for his film music {{should be given to}} the composers <b>who</b> <b>worked</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> Raksin – who worked with Chaplin on Modern Times – stressed Chaplin's creative position and active participation in the composing process. This process, which could take months, would start with Chaplin describing to the composer(s) exactly what he wanted and singing or playing tunes he had improvised on the piano. These tunes were then developed further in a close collaboration among the composer(s) and Chaplin. According to film historian Jeffrey Vance, [...] "although he relied upon associates to arrange varied and complex instrumentation, the musical imperative is his, and not a note in a Chaplin musical score was placed there without his assent." ...|$|E
