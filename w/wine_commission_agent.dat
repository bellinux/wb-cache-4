40|$|This paper {{undertakes}} structural {{estimation of}} asymmetric auction models {{in a market}} for basmati, and detects {{the presence of a}} cartel consisting of a large (in market share) local miller and <b>commission</b> <b>agents</b> purchasing for large distant millers. The contracts between the distant millers and their <b>commission</b> <b>agents</b> help to explain the specific form that collusion takes. Simulations indicate that (i) the cartel gains considerably by colluding, over the competitive outcome; (ii) however, sellers (farmers) do not lose significantly under collusion when the <b>commission</b> <b>agents</b> bid. The paper also shows that efficient collusion, the form of collusion commonly assumed in the literature, does not explain the data well. ...|$|R

30|$|Contractors are {{important}} parts of the date marketing chain in Pakistan. They perform early yield estimates of palm groves and costs for labour, storage, transportation, and processing of dates (Khushk et al. 2009). Often contracts for date palm grove were made as early as at the pollination stage. This again was similar to data reported by RUAF (2014) for value chain of dates in Gaza. In our study contractors payed (5  %) more to date palm growers for their produce compared with <b>commission</b> <b>agents.</b> Some contractors also took loans from commission agents; they either sold dates through them or payed back loans and interest after marketing their produce. Aujla et al. (2007) noted that 70 – 90  % of the fruit growers in Pakistan sold their harvesting rights at the flowering stage to contractors, while more than 97  % of the fruit contractors took loans from <b>commission</b> <b>agents</b> to pay the contract money to fruit orchard owners and labourers working in the groves. This underlines the dependency of contractors on <b>commission</b> <b>agents</b> for credit in the study area.|$|R
