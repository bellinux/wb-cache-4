40|$|Purpose Customers play a {{key role}} in value creation. Not surprisingly, {{research}} has investigated customers' motivations to engage in the creation of value. However, the link between mood regulatory processes and customer participation in value creation has so far been neglected. Design/methodology/approach This study develops a model that relates mood regulatory processes to customer participation and customer value creation, and tests it with a sample of 419 hotel customers, using PLS. Findings We find that: mood clarity relates directly <b>with</b> <b>customer</b> relational value; mood monitoring relates directly <b>with</b> <b>customer</b> participation as well as directly and indirectly <b>with</b> <b>customer</b> economic and relational value; and mood repair relates directly <b>with</b> <b>customer</b> participation and customer economic value, as well as indirectly <b>with</b> <b>customer</b> economic and relational value.

A multiple regression analysis was used to confirm the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. The results show that TdC Service Center has a positive relationship <b>with</b> <b>customer</b> preferred channel. Dealers have positive relationship <b>with</b> <b>customer</b> preferred channel. Hypermarkets have no relationship <b>with</b> <b>customer</b> preferred channel. General Stores (Bookstore & Stationery Supplier) have no relationship <b>with</b> <b>customer</b> preferred channel. Internet and kiosks have no relationship <b>with</b> <b>customer</b> preferred channel. Whether the relationship is positive is subjected to further test. For being passive and not pro-active in distribution channels in current stiff competition market, TdC will be left behind in the race of engaging the markets. As such, TdC have to quickly catch up with their competitors to win back TdC market. It is recommended TdC quickly look into the expanding service centre and distributor network as these are very powerful channels, to reach larger market coverage...|$|R
