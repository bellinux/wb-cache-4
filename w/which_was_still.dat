Buckingham House was eventually sold by Buckingham's natural son, Sir Charles Sheffield, in 1761 to GeorgeIII for £21,000.

The harbour patrol craft Appletree was sunk in a collision with an RAF pinnace east of the Lismore light in October 1940 with, according to one report, the loss of two lives.

5|$|Typhoon Vera, {{also known}} as the , was an {{exceptionally}} intense tropical cyclone that struck Japan in September1959, becoming the strongest and deadliest typhoon on record to make landfall on the country.

In the aftermath of Vera, Japan's disaster management and relief systems were significantly reformed, and the typhoon's effects would set a benchmark for future storms striking the country.|$|E
5|$|A {{moderate}} {{storm surge}} accompanied Tropical Storm Bill as it made landfall on Louisiana. In the state, the maximum reported surge was , {{and it occurred}} at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium facility in Chauvin. In Montegut, the surge breached a levee <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> damaged {{from the effects of}} Hurricane Lili 9months before. The breach flooded many homes in the town, forcing the evacuation of an entire neighborhood. As a result, 150homes in the town were damaged, with half of them severely. The storm surge affected numerous low-lying cities in southeastern Louisiana by flooding roadways, including the only road to Grand Isle, stranding residents and visitors. The road was opened a day after the storm as floodwaters receded. The floodwaters entered a few homes and businesses in St. Tammany Parish. Damage from the storm surge totaled $4.1million (2003USD). Rough waves sank two boats offshore; their occupants were rescued.|$|E
5|$|According to Plutarch, an army under Parmenion {{defeated}} the Illyrian king Grabos in 356 BC, {{shortly after the}} conclusion of the siege of Potidea. Grabos then became a subject ally of Macedon. The following year, Philip seems to have defeated Ketriporis, and reduced him to the status of a subject ally, although information for this campaign is very limited. He is also presumed to have {{defeated the}} Paionians at some point during this period, although there is no explicit record of this.

5|$|By Sunday afternoon, 18hours {{after the}} alarm {{was raised in}} Pudding Lane, the fire had become a raging {{firestorm}} that created its own weather. A tremendous uprush of hot air above the flames was driven by the chimney effect wherever constrictions narrowed the air current, such as the constricted space between jettied buildings, and this left a vacuum at ground level. The resulting strong inward winds did not tend to put the fire out, as might be thought; instead, they supplied fresh oxygen to the flames, and the turbulence created by the uprush made the wind veer erratically both {{north and south of}} the main easterly direction of the gale <b>which</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> blowing.|$|E
