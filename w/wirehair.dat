50|$|Breeding {{between the}} two {{produced}} wirehaired kittens, {{many of which were}} sold off to other interested breeders. As the population grew, cats were exported to Canada, and Germany where they are especially popular. The breed did well, and in 1967 it was recognized by the CFA, and in 1978, it was accepted for championship competition. American <b>Wirehairs</b> have yet to make an appearance in Britain and Australia, among other countries.|$|R

50|$|The American <b>Wirehair</b> is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} cat originating in upstate New York. As of 2003, though the breed is well-known, it is ranked {{as the most}} rare of the 41 Cat Fanciers' Association breeds, with only 22 registered, down from 39 in 2002.|$|E
5000|$|American Wirehairs {{are similar}} to American Shorthairs, with the {{exception}} of a springy, wiry coat, including ear fur, and whiskers. [...] This coat is similar to the wire coats of some dog breeds, such as terriers. Their fur requires little grooming, although lighter cats may require sunblock. Wirehairs are of a moderate, sturdy build, with round heads, high cheekbones, and a pronounced muzzle. [...] Females are generally smaller than males. American Wirehairs display the full spectrum of possible cat coat colors, although Himalayan, Chocolate and Lilac are not accepted for competition. The <b>Wirehair</b> coat trait is dominant, so any breeding between a <b>Wirehair</b> and another cat can produce wired kittens. Wirehairs have golden eyes, except for some white ones that have blue or amber eyes.|$|E
5000|$|... 1968/9 & 1985: Dutch Rex. The first {{occurrence}} was in Zaandam in 1968 or 1969 when {{a female}} cat produced a rexed daughter. The daughter produced rexed offspring when mated to unrelated straight-haired males, including Siamese cats, demonstrating {{this to be}} a dominant mutation. The fur tended to form dreadlocks and had a coarse, unruly texture. The cats were also prone to balding. Cat fanciers believed the strain originated from an American <b>Wirehair</b> belonging to military personnel. The mutation reappeared in 1985 and was also known as the <b>Wirehair</b> Rex. These cats were traceable as descendents of the discontinued Dutch Rex breeding program. The last known Dutch Rex was a female cat of unknown origin found in Amsterdam in the late 1990s. The dominant mutation produced a rex type of coat in the heterozygote and a sparse coat in the homozygote.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Wirehair</b> has an even, {{balanced}} temperament {{which is}} essentially identical to that of its American Shorthair relative. Wirehairs are equally content to play or fall asleep in their owners' laps. They {{have been described as}} cute and somewhat humorous. They are gentle and quiet, but also playful and active. They have quiet voices. American Wirehairs generally prefer to stay indoors.|$|E
50|$|The story {{revolves}} around a German <b>wirehair</b> pointer named Moreover, {{who has a}} strong relationship with a red-headed boy named Lonnie (Johnny Whitaker) despite his mishaps. Moreover, is dealt to Willie Dorsey (Godfrey Cambridge), a gas station clerk, but Lonnie and his best friend Text regain possession of the dog. They train Moreover, to be a prize-winning bird pointer, entering him in a field trial.|$|E
50|$|The American <b>Wirehair</b> is a {{spontaneous}} mutation of the American Shorthair. It first occurred as a random mutation among {{a litter of}} five born {{to a pair of}} barn cats in 1966 in Vernon, in upstate New York. This single red-and-white male had wiry fur. The owner of the cats called a local breeder of Rex cats, Mrs. Joan O'Shea, {{to take a look at}} the kitten. She bought the kitten for $50, along with one of his normal-coated female littermates, to start a breeding program. The wirehaired male was named Adam, and the female Tip-Top head to.|$|E
