6000|$|This general {{stifling}} of {{the better}} intelligence {{of the world and}} its possible release to expression and power, {{seems to me to be}} the fundamental issue underlying all the present troubles of mankind. We cannot get on while everywhere fools and vulgarians hold the levers that can kill, imprison, silence and starve men. We cannot get on with false government and we cannot get on with mob government; we must have right government. The intellectual people of the world have a duty of co-operation they have too long neglected. The modernization of political institutions, the study of these institutions until we have worked out and achieved the very best and most efficient methods whereby the whole community of mankind may work together under the direction of its chosen intelligences, is the common duty of every one who has a brain for the service. And before everything else <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> this crudity and imperfection in what we call [...] "democracy" [...] at the present time. Democracy is still chiefly an aspiration, it is a spirit, it is an idea; for the most part its methods are still to seek. And still more is this [...] "League of Free Nations" [...] as yet but an aspiration. Let us not underrate the task before us. Only the disinterested devotion of hundreds of thousands of active brains in school, in pulpit, in book and press and assembly can ever bring these redeeming conceptions down to the solid earth to rule.|$|E

The song was [...] "Rosenrot", and when <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> that the band changed their minds and it did not even make it on to the album, we were speechless.

60|$|First, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> the {{peculiar}} relations between Europe, ancient and mediaeval, {{and the great}} empires of Eastern Asia. The two civilizations {{had never been in}} direct contact. Yet in a sense they were always connected. The Greeks and the Romans had at least vague reports of peoples who lived on the far eastern confines of the world, beyond even the conquests of Alexander the Great in Hindustan. It is certain, too, that Europe and Asia had always traded with one another in a strange and unconscious fashion. The spices and silks of the unknown East passed westward from trader to trader, from caravan to caravan, until they reached the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, and, at last, the Mediterranean. The journey was so slow, so tedious, the goods passed from hand to hand so often, that when the Phoenician, Greek, or Roman merchants bought them their origin had been forgotten. For century after century this trade continued. When Rome fell, other peoples of the Mediterranean continued the Eastern trade. Genoa and Venice rose to greatness by this trade. As wealth and culture revived after the Gothic conquest which overthrew Rome, the beautiful silks and the rare spices of the East were more and more prized in a world of increasing luxury. The Crusades rediscovered Egypt, Syria, and the East for Europe. Gold and jewels, diamond-hilted swords of Damascus steel, carved ivory, and priceless gems,--all the treasures which the warriors of the Cross brought home, helped to impress on the mind of Europe the surpassing riches of the East.|$|E

Such gender bias reinforces gender inequality and continues to keep our traditional misogyny alive. 3. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>realize</b> our mistakes and strive to achieve a new understanding with total fairness. 4.
