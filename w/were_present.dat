5|$|Gens {{also came}} into {{conflict}} with the Judenrat and Friend over the Jewish policemen who guarded the gates into the ghetto. The Germans allowed the Jewish policemen to control access to the ghetto and conduct searches for contraband. Gens' policy was that when no Germans <b>were</b> <b>present</b> at the gates, the policemen would do minimal searches and would allow smuggling of food and other necessary items. If Germans <b>were</b> <b>present</b> at the gates, the policemen conducted thorough searches and often beat up attempted smugglers. In Gens' view, if the Germans thought the Jewish policemen were not vigilant enough, the policemen would be replaced by German guards and any opportunity for smuggling would cease. He also claimed that even when the Germans <b>were</b> <b>present,</b> any confiscated items were brought into the ghetto, which {{would not be the}} case if there were German guards at the gates.|$|E
