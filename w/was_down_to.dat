5|$|A {{very fast}} Schumacher {{took the lead}} on track on lap 12 when Berger ran wide, before relinquishing the race lead overall to Berger {{when he made his}} first pitstop, {{confirming}} that his pace {{both before and after the}} red flag <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> him running a three-stop strategy, therefore racing with a lighter car. Berger pitted at the end of lap 15 for his first of two scheduled stops, before retiring a lap later with handling problems. Häkkinen led his first ever laps of a Formula One World Championship race, before pitting at the end of lap 18. Following the first series of pit stops, Schumacher resumed the race lead.|$|E
5|$|Ajax {{accepted}} a €12million bid for Mido from Marseille in July, and completed the move on {{a five-year contract}} on 12 July 2003, which made Mido the most expensive Egyptian player ever. He made his debut for Marseille in 1–0 win over Guingamp on 1 August 2003. Jean-Pierre Papin gave praise to Mido, saying it <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> players like him that the French Ligue 1 was among the top European leagues. He scored against Real Madrid in a UEFA Champions League match in November, which Marseille lost 2–1.|$|E

Santa Catarina’s guinea pig, native to a single island in Brazil, <b>is</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> its last 40-60 individuals, reduced by hunting and habitat disturbance. The great Indian bustard is threatened by habitat loss resulting from agriculture and human development, and <b>is</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the last 50-250 individuals. Elaeocarpus bojeri, a flowering plant found only on the island of Mauritius, has fewer than 10 surviving individuals, because of loss of habitat. The Baishan fir (Abies beshanzuensis), native <b>to</b> China, <b>is</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> five surviving mature individuals. Priceless or Worthless? describes the threats that each species is facing, along with measures that would aid their survival.|$|R
50|$|Big cat {{populations have}} {{severely}} declined {{over the last}} half-century and could face extinction in the following decades. According to IUCN estimates: lions <b>are</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> 25,000, from 450,000; leopards <b>are</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> 50,000, from 750,000; cheetahs <b>are</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> 12,000, from 45,000; tigers <b>are</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> 3,000 in the wild, from 50,000. A December 2016 study by the Zoological Society of London, Panthera Corporation and Wildlife Conservation Society showed that cheetahs are far closer to extinction than previously thought, with only 7,100 remaining in the wild, and crammed within only 9% of their historic range. Human pressures {{are to blame for}} the cheetah population crash, including prey loss due to overhunting by people, retaliatory killing from farmers, habitat loss and the illegal wildlife trade.|$|R

There, the brigade was to join with Marine reinforcements to re-form the 1st Marine Division, which would then be a part of X Corps for a counterattack at Inchon. However, the North Korean Great Naktong Offensive delayed these plans, as the brigade was needed to repel one more North Korean crossing of the Naktong River.|$|E

By 1983, overall economic growth was stronger, and inflation and mortgage rates had fallen to their lowest levels in 13 years, although manufacturing employment as a share of total employment fell to just over 30%, with total unemployment remaining high, peaking at 3.3million in 1984.|$|E

5|$|By mid-2012 Iceland was {{regarded}} as one of Europe's recovery success stories. It has had two years of economic growth. Unemployment <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> 6.3% and Iceland was attracting immigrants to fill jobs. Currency devaluation effectively reduced wages by 50% making exports more competitive and imports more expensive. Ten-year government bonds were issued below 6%, lower than some of the PIIGS nations in the EU (Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece, and Spain). Tryggvi Thor Herbertsson, a member of parliament, noted that adjustments via currency devaluations are less painful than government labor policies and negotiations. Nevertheless, while EU fervor has cooled the government continued to pursue membership.|$|E
5|$|Expected to {{last only}} two days, the {{evacuation}} of remaining evacuees proved more difficult than rescue organizations anticipated as transportation convoys struggled with damaged infrastructure {{and a growing number}} of evacuees. By the morning of September 1, Governor Blanco reported that the number of evacuees in the Superdome <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> 2,500. However, by evening, eleven hours after evacuation efforts began, the Superdome held 10,000 more people than it did at dawn. Evacuees from across the city swelled the crowd to about 30,000, believing the arena was the best place to get a ride out of town.|$|E
5|$|German {{intelligence}} {{suggested that}} the RAF <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> just 300 serviceable fighters on 17 August 1940, taking into consideration German pilots' claims and their estimates of British production capabilities. In fact, there were 855 machines serviceable, with another 289 at storage units and 84 at training units. These resources were included {{in a total of}} 1,438 fighters, twice as many as at the beginning of July 1940. Expecting weakening opposition, the Luftwaffe prepared for a major action against RAF Sector Stations on 18 August.|$|E

Damaged tanks were quickly repaired, but its strength was initially greatly weakened.|$|E
5|$|In {{reaching}} the upper Naktong valley {{at the end}} of July, the North Korean divisions engaged {{in this part of the}} drive southward had suffered heavy casualties. The NK 1st Division in battling across the Mun'gyong plateau against the ROK 6th Division not only suffered great losses in the ground battle but also took serious losses from UN aerial attack. Prisoners reported that by the time it reached Hamch'ang {{at the end of}} July it <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> 3,000 men from the 5,500 it had before the push. The NK 15th Division, according to prisoners, also lost heavily to artillery and mortar fire in its drive on Sangju against ROK troops and the US 24th Infantry Regiment, and <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> about 5,000 men at the end of July, from 7,500 before the fight. In contrast, the NK 13th Division had bypassed Hamch'ang on the west and, save for minor skirmishes with ROK troops and the 2nd Battalion, 35th Infantry, it had not been engaged and consequently had suffered relatively few casualties.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s the {{congregation}} {{could still be}} assured of the required quorum of ten men for the minyan during the week, as local businessmen attended the morning and evening prayers before opening and after closing their shops.

5|$|Leased to S.R. Maxwell and Company, a new {{settlement}} {{was established in}} 1916, this time built entirely upon copra export. Much of the South islet was deforested {{to make way for}} coconut palms, a non-indigenous plant. The business venture, however, went into debt, and the island's settlement slowly decreased in population. By 1926, it <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> only ten residents and by 1936, the settlement consisted of only two Tahitian families before abandonment sometime in the late 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Normal time {{ended with}} the game at 2–2. The ensuing periods of extra time saw {{defensive}} football from both sides; Celtic <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> ten men when Bobo Balde was dismissed on 95 minutes after his second yellow card. On 112 minutes, Derlei reacted quickest to a Robert Douglas block and rounded McNamara make it 3–2 for Porto. Porto managed to hang on even after having Nuno Valente sent off just {{before the end of}} extra-time, thus ensuring that Porto had ended their 16-year wait between European trophies. It was Porto's first UEFA Cup win, and they were also the first team to win a trophy on the silver goal rule.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Cavalry Division <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> half {{strength}} when it {{was withdrawn}} from the front line on Leyte for a brief rest in January 1945, but few reinforcements arrived before it was ordered to move to Luzon, where it disembarked over the beaches at San Fabian on 27 January 1945. General of the Army Douglas MacArthur ordered the 1st Cavalry Division's commander, Major General Vern D. Mudge, to conduct a rapid advance on Manila. For this, Mudge formed three flying columns. Initially, Chase's 1st Brigade's mission was to follow one of the columns but on 1 February he was relieved {{of responsibility for the}} main body of the 1st Brigade and placed in command of all three flying columns.|$|E

5|$|The attack tapered {{off with}} the coming of daylight, but that night it resumed. The North Koreans struck {{repeatedly}} at the defense line. This time they continued the fighting into the daylight hours of 9 September. The Air Force then concentrated strong air support over the regimental perimeter to aid the ground troops. Casualties came to the aid stations from the infantry companies in an almost steady stream during the morning. All available men from Headquarters Company and special units were formed into squads and put into the fight at the most critical points. At one time, the regimental reserve <b>was</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> six men. When the attack finally ceased shortly after 12:00 the 23rd Regiment had an estimated combat efficiency of only 38 percent.|$|E
