2500|$|In a 1994 {{interview}} {{that can be}} found on the Academy of Achievement website, Coppola insisted, [...] "The Godfather was a very unappreciated movie when we were making it. They were very unhappy with it. They didn't like the cast. They didn't like the way I was shooting it. I was always on the verge of getting fired." [...] When word of this reached Brando, he threatened to walk off the picture, writing in his memoir, [...] "I strongly believe that directors are entitled to independence and freedom to realize their vision, though Francis left the characterizations in our hands and we had to figure out what to do." [...] In a 2010 television interview with Larry King, Al Pacino also talked about how Brando's support helped him keep the role of Michael Corleone in the movie—despite the fact Coppola wanted to fire him. Brando was on his best behavior during filming, buoyed by a cast that included Pacino, Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton. In the Vanity Fair article [...] "The Godfather Wars", Mark Seals writes, [...] "With the actors, as in the movie, Brando served as the head of the family. He broke the ice by toasting the group with a glass of wine. 'When we were young, Brando was like the godfather of actors,' says Robert Duvall. 'I used to meet with Dustin Hoffman in Cromwell's Drugstore, and if <b>we</b> <b>mentioned</b> his name once, <b>we</b> <b>mentioned</b> it 25 times in a day.' Caan adds, 'The first day we met Brando everybody was in awe.'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "We {{have said}} nothing {{concerning}} you," [...] said Matt. [...] "We {{have not even}} advised people to beware of our rivals, nor have <b>we</b> <b>mentioned</b> your stop in Bethlehem, and how the folks of that town regarded your doings there," [...] he went on pointedly.|$|E

60|$|The third Japanese was {{the best}} prize to us; for he came with money, {{and a great deal}} of gold uncoined, to buy such goods as <b>we</b> <b>mentioned</b> above.

60|$|The counting-house {{was built}} on a {{projection}} of earth about midway between {{the top of the}} cliff and the sea. When we got there, the agent, to whom our letter was addressed, was absent; but his place was supplied by two miners who came out to receive us; and to one of them <b>we</b> <b>mentioned</b> our recommendation, and modestly hinted a wish to go down the mine forthwith.|$|E

60|$|We found {{those people}} clothed, {{generally}} speaking, over their whole bodies, their heads, arms, {{legs and feet}} excepted, but not so agreeably as those <b>we</b> <b>mentioned</b> above; {{and we found that}} the clothing of these were generally made of the skins of beasts, but very artfully put together, so that though they had neither needle nor thread, yet they had the same plant as I mentioned before, the stalk of which would so strongly tie like a thread, that they peeled it off thicker or finer as they had occasion, and made use of it abundance of ways to tie and twist, and make their clothes with it, as well for their occasion {{as if it had been}} woven in a loom.|$|E
6000|$|In Summer, 1780, as <b>we</b> <b>mentioned,</b> Kaiser Joseph was on {{his first}} Visit to the Czarina. They met at Mohilow on the Dnieper, {{towards the end of}} May; have been roving about, as if in mere galas and amusements (though {{with a great deal of}} {{business}} incidentally thrown in), for above a month since, when Prince de Ligne is summoned to join them at Petersburg. He goes by Berlin, stays at Potsdam with Friedrich for about a week; and reports to Polish Majesty these new Dialogues of 1780, the year after sending him those of Mahrisch-Neustadt of 1770, which we read above. Those were written down from memory, in 1785; these in 1786,--and [...] "towards the end of it," [...] as is internally evident. Let these also be welcome to us on such terms as there are.|$|E
6000|$|Camp shifts about, and Crown-Prince in it: to Heidelberg, to Waiblingen, Weinheim; {{close to}} Mainz at one time: {{but it is}} not worth following: nor in Friedrich's own Letters, or in other documents, is there, on the best examination, {{anything}} considerable to be gleaned respecting his procedures there. He hears of the ill-success in Italy, Battle of Parma at the due date, with the natural feelings; speaks with a sorrowful gayety, of the muddy fatigues, futilities here on the Rhine;--has the sense, however, not to blame his superiors unreasonably. Here, from one of his Letters to Colonel Camas, is a passage worth quoting for the credit of the writer. With Camas, a distinguished Prussian Frenchman, whom <b>we</b> <b>mentioned</b> elsewhere, still more with Madame Camas in time coming, he corresponded much, often in a fine filial manner:-- ...|$|E
