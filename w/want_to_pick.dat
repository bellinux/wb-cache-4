[...] "Like most adolescents, Veronica understands and anticipates this mix, even if she doesn't always deal {{with it in the}} most effective way. Even if you don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> sides, you're bound to be assessed as having done so. And once you're labeled—09er or not—you can either spend your time fighting rumors or finding alternative measures. Veronica, so precociously and brilliantly aware of alternatives, makes this familiar process seem worth pondering one more time." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 2012 {{during an}} interview, Milian spoke of her Young Money debut: [...] "Wayne just gets his artists, which is great, I {{have a very}} {{one-on-one}} business relationship with everybody from Mack Maine to Wayne. They're just very {{involved in the project}} as far as bringing the music, playing songs, just giving their input. [...] I really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> the perfect single though. It's been a second since I've been out musically, so I do not want to fail and I don't believe in failure, so I just try new things and figure out the pieces. That's one thing that's great about Wayne. He's like, 'Work with different producers, take your time, but at the same time, try new things. Don't be stuck on one thing.'" [...] In July 2013, it was discovered that her contract with The Voice would be ended.|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} proportion of the CD release of Memory Almost Full incorporated a cover insert whose top-right corner was intentionally folded down {{to the center of the}} insert, leaving the CD tray visible. The folded-down white corner covers up the corner of the armchair image, but has the artist and album names printed so that the text is complete despite the fold. Upon opening and flattening out the cover insert, the armchair is complete, but the portion of the text which is printed on the folded-down corner is not printed on the front of the cover, leaving the text incomplete. This was the first time such an artistic intervention occurred within a standard jewel-case, and at first glance had the possibility of being viewed as a mis-manufactured copy. McCartney on the CD case/album artwork: [...] "I really wanted to make the CD a desirable object. [...] Something that I know I'd <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up from the shelf, something that would make people curious." ...|$|E

Bush remarked, [...] "I {{sat next to her}} once, thought she was beautiful, and I think she's very happy in Alaska, and I hope she'll stay there." [...] Palin responded, [...] "I don't want to, sort of, concede that we {{have to get used to}} this kind of thing, because I think the majority of Americans don't want to put up with the blue-bloods– and I say it with all due respect, because I love the Bushes– but, the blue-bloods, who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> and choose their winners, instead of allowing competition to pick and choose the winners." ...|$|E
2500|$|Theatre {{writer and}} {{historian}} John Kenrick wrote, [...] "the {{bad news is}} that this Follies is a dramatic and conceptual failure. The good news is that it also features some of the most exciting musical moments Broadway has seen in several seasons. Since you don't get those moments from the production, the book or the leads, that leaves the featured ensemble, and in Follies that amounts to a small army. ... Marge Champion and Donald Saddler are endearing as the old hoofers. ... I dare you not {{to fall in love with}} Betty Garrett's understated [...] "Broadway Baby" [...] – you just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> her up and hug her.

2500|$|When it was rereleased in 2001 as Super Mario Advance it {{received}} generally positive reviews, garnering an aggregate score of 84% on Metacritic. One reviewer concluded [...] "all nostalgia and historical influence aside, Super Mario Bros. 2 {{is still a}} game worth playing {{on the merits of}} its gameplay alone", also saying that [...] "the only reason you may not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> it up is if ... you already own it in another form." [...] However, GameSpot thought that Super Mario Bros. 3 or Super Mario World would have been a better choice for a launch game considering their respective popularity; both titles were eventually also remade as part of the Super Mario Advance series. Conversely, IGN praised the choice, calling it [...] "one of the most polished and creative platformers of the era". The game was named one of the NES best games ever by IGN, saying that the game offers greater diversity in graphics and gameplay than the original, making it a great bridge game between the other NES Mario titles. ScrewAttack named Wart's battle theme in a list of the top ten best 8-Bit Final Boss Themes.|$|E

It was {{nominated}} for GameSpy's 2007 [...] "Game of the Year" [...] Award for the PS2, and Rockstar London {{was nominated for}} the [...] "Best New UK/European Studio" [...] Award. Giant Bomb listed it at #13 in their [...] "Best Storyline In Gaming" [...] list, and at #5 in their [...] "Shocking Moments in Video Games" [...] list. When GameSpot asked Jeronimo Barrera if the trouble that Rockstar had experienced in attempting to bring Manhunt 2 to release in North America had put the publisher off the franchise, Barrera shot down any doubt by confirming that if the fans wanted it, {{they were willing to}} continue the brand. Rockstar Games admitted that they were proud of the series and the fact people still <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> on the games is [...] "a strange and unfortunate reality." [...] Mark Washbrook gave an interview with the Official UK PlayStation Magazine in April 2007, in which he said that much of the reasoning behind the development of Manhunt 2 was its fan base.|$|E
2500|$|The 16th {{season of}} The Simpsons has {{garnered}} generally positive reviews from critics, with many noting while the episodes are still good and funny {{they are of}} a lesser quality {{than those of the}} show's earlier seasons. CraveOnline gave the season a rating of 8.0 out of 10, and spoke highly of its [...] "little pieces of continuity", [...] "sharp parody", and [...] "non sequitur gags". Entertainment Focus gave it 4 out of 5 stars, concluding [...] "Some people have criticised The Simpsons claiming that the show is tired and has passed its prime. We don't agree with those people at all and think The Simpsons has been remarkably consistent in terms of its humour and stories. Sure it may have been eclipsed by the edgier Family Guy in more recent years but The Simpsons is, and always will be, one of the most original and talked-about shows. The Simpsons: Season 16 is another cracking instalment of the hit show and we still, after all these years, just can't get enough. High-Def Digest also gave a 4/5 star rating, saying [...] "As mentioned in the review, there are plenty of laughs to be had in this season, but very few of them come from a place that feels truly genuine and sincere. Sixteen seasons in, it seems that the show is a mixture of been-there-done-that sentiment and perfunctory punch lines. Aside from the so-so image, there's plenty here to keep the die-hard 'Simpsons' fan happy, so this one comes recommended for fans". Cinema Sentries said [...] "This is not something to pick up if you are a general TV fan, or a casual Simpsons fan. The overall quality of the season is not high enough, and you may not get satisfactory enjoyment from them. If you sort of turned your back on the show, this probably isn't the season to check out. However, if you are a Simpsons devotee, then you will <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> it up". DVDTalk wrote [...] "The Simpsons: Season Sixteen isn't the best of the series' run but it is a very strong collection of truly funny and frequently quite clever doses of animated comedic insanity." ...|$|E
