25|$|Balloon Burst - In this mini-game, {{players have}} to pop an opponent's balloon by {{answering}} questions right first {{before anyone else}} does. Each player starts with 2 balloons. If one player runs out of balloons, he/she is out. <b>Whoever</b> <b>is</b> the last one standing wins the mini-game.|$|E
25|$|Today, some realms govern {{succession}} {{by their}} own domestic laws, while others, either by written clauses in their constitution or by convention, stipulate that <b>whoever</b> <b>is</b> monarch of the United Kingdom is automatically also monarch of that realm. It is generally agreed that any unilateral alteration of succession by the UK would not have effect in all the realms.|$|E

50|$|On 1 July 2006, Kanjevac was hit {{and killed}} by three of seven shots fired as he {{was getting out of}} his parked car on Božidara Adžije Street in Niš. Once again, <b>whoever</b> <b>was</b> {{responsible}} was never identified.|$|R
25|$|A {{special case}} of zugzwang is {{reciprocal}} zugzwang or mutual zugzwang, {{which is a}} position such that <b>whoever</b> <b>is</b> to move is in zugzwang. Studying positions of reciprocal zugzwang is {{in the analysis of}} endgames. A position of mutual zugzwang is closely related to a game with a Conway value of zero in game theory.|$|E
25|$|There {{could be}} a freeman {{with the spirit of}} the slave, and there {{could be a}} slave with a spirit full of freedom; <b>whoever</b> <b>is</b> {{faithful}} to himself – he is a freeman, and whoever fills his life only with what is good and beautiful in the eyes of others – he is a slave.|$|E
25|$|An extreme type of {{reciprocal}} zugzwang, called trébuchet, {{is shown in}} the diagram. It is also called a full-point mutual zugzwang because it will result in a loss for the player in zugzwang, resulting a full point for his opponent. <b>Whoever</b> <b>is</b> to move in this position must abandon his own pawn, thus allowing his opponent to capture it and proceed to promote the remaining pawn, resulting in an easily winnable position.|$|E

25|$|A Speaker may {{be removed}} from office in a coup, or can be {{replaced}} by death or resignation. In some cases a Speaker may be compelled to resign at the middle of a Congress' session after he has lost support of the majority of congressmen; in that case, an election for a new Speaker is held. Despite being a partisan official, the Speaker (or <b>whoever</b> <b>is</b> presiding) doesn't vote unless in breaking ties in accodance with the Rules of the House of Representatives.|$|E
25|$|Phenomenology {{at lower}} {{energies}} in quantum chromodynamics {{is not completely}} understood due to the difficulties of managing such a theory with a strong coupling. This may be the reason why confinement has not been theoretically proven, {{though it is a}} consistent experimental observation. Proof that QCD confines at low energy is a mathematical problem of great relevance, and an award has been proposed by the Clay Mathematics Institute for <b>whoever</b> <b>is</b> also able to show that the Yang–Mills theory has a mass gap and its existence.|$|E
25|$|A game {{is played}} in four quarters, each lasting fifteen minutes. There are {{intervals}} of three minutes {{between the first and}} second quarters and between the third and fourth quarters, and an interval of five minutes at half time. If an umpire or player calls time, the time keeper pauses the timer. When play resumes, the timer is restarted. A maximum of two minutes is allowed for an injury. Overtimes, in elimination games, consist of two straight seven-minute periods; if still tied after fourteen minutes, <b>whoever</b> <b>is</b> up two points will win.|$|E

2500|$|For the 6.00 am shift change, the signalmen had {{developed}} an informal arrangement allowing <b>whoever</b> <b>was</b> working the early day shift to arrive for work at around 6.30 am. [...] This allowed the day shift signalman {{to get up}} slightly later, and to travel {{to work on the}} local train when it was to be shunted at Quintinshill, thus saving the walk from Gretna. The signalman at Gretna would advise <b>whoever</b> <b>was</b> working the early shift when the local was to be shunted at Quintinshill.|$|R
5000|$|Paul advises that [...] "each {{man must}} remain in that {{condition}} {{in which he was}} called." [...] For slaves, however, he specifically adds this: [...] "Were you called while a slave? Do not be concerned about it. But if you are able to gain your freedom, avail yourself of the opportunity." [...] And then follows a wider principle: [...] "For <b>whoever</b> <b>was</b> called in the Lord as a slave is a freed person belonging to the Lord, just as <b>whoever</b> <b>was</b> free when called is a slave of Christ." ...|$|R
25|$|Beuys made {{it clear}} that he {{considered}} this song as a work of art, not the “pop” product it appears to be, which is apparent from the moment one views it. Such becomes more obvious when one looks at the lyrics, which are aimed directly at Reagan, the military complex and <b>whoever</b> <b>is</b> trying to defrost the “Cold War” to make it “hot.” The song has to be understood in the context of intense liberal and progressive frustration in 1982. Beuys warns Reagan et al. that the peace-loving masses are behind him, and that includes the Americans as well.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{and their}} parents must receive psychotherapy, which should include {{marriage}} counselling. Mitigation of lasting psychological problems, including depression secondary to chronic illness and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), can be very successfully addressed with early interventions. This care may come from the family physician, or other attending physician, <b>whoever</b> <b>is</b> more appropriate; specialist care is generally not required. Lewis and Vitulano (2003) note several studies suggesting predisposal for psychopathology in paediatric patients with chronic illness. Esch (2002) advocates preventive psychiatry supports to facilitate balance {{of positive and negative}} stressors associated with chronic physical pathology. Patients with FSS should have pre-emptive and ongoing mixed cognitive therapy-psychodynamic psychotherapy for patients with FSS and cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), if begun after onset of obvious pathology.|$|E
25|$|Kitty: In {{games with}} players where the cards cannot be dealt evenly, {{there is a}} {{variation}} in which no cards are removed from the deck, but instead a kitty composed of the leftover cards (or one trick's worth of cards plus the leftovers) is placed at center. <b>Whoever</b> <b>is</b> dealt the 2, or alternatively, the player with the highest bid (tie-breaker being first to make that bid), picks up the kitty before bidding begins, integrates it into their hand and then discards {{the same number of}} cards. If a round of cards in addition to the leftovers is placed in the kitty, the discard by the player who picked up the kitty counts as a trick. This introduces more uncertainty in bids because usually the person with the kitty tries to void one suit and trump earlier in the game.|$|E

25|$|Poirot visits Mertonshire, {{where an}} old friend, Lady Carmichael, gives him {{details of the}} Grant family. All the girls {{are going to the}} bad as their father cannot control them. They keep company with Hawker, who has an {{unpleasant}} reputation, as does another of his 'lady friends', Mrs Larkin. Lady Carmichael is thrilled to think that Poirot has visited to investigate some special crime but the detective tells her he is simply there to tame four wild horses. He visits General Grant whose house is filled with artifacts from India. The General himself completes the clichéd picture, sitting in an armchair with his foot bandaged up from gout, drinking port and railing against the world. Poirot breaks the news of the drugs and listens to the old man's cries of anger and sworn threats against <b>whoever</b> <b>is</b> getting his girls into trouble. Leaving the room, Poirot clumsily trips against his host.|$|E
25|$|Fai's {{real name}} is , and {{he was born with}} his {{identical}} twin brother, Fai, in Valeria Country. The birth of twins in the country was a bad omen, which led to many misfortunes upon the country. The king imprisoned them within a tower, just before he killed everybody in the country. Eventually, Fei-Wang Reed appeared and offered to free one of them. Fai chose to save Yūi, resulting in Fai being thrown from the tower to his death, though Fei-Wang tampered with Yūi's memory to make him think that he chose his own life over Fai. Promising to return Fai to life if Yūi becomes his pawn, Fei-Wang bestowed two curses upon him. The curses are to kill <b>whoever</b> <b>is</b> a stronger magician than he is, and another curse will use his magic to collapse the world around them. He was soon found by Ashura-ō, who took in Yūi, having adopted the name Fai. Ashura conforted Fai, and gave him his tattoo to suppress the first curse. Fai eventually learned that Ashura's purpose was to be killed by Fai's first curse, as Ashura killed people in order to make his magic stronger.|$|E

They must also find ways to express their feelings about each other and keep some semblance of control as the town descends into chaos.|$|E

500|$|In late May, al-Sharif {{drove her}} car in Khobar with al-Huwaider filming. The video was posted to YouTube and Facebook. In the video, al-Sharif stated, [...] "This is a {{volunteer}} campaign {{to help the}} girls of this country [...] At least for times of emergency, God forbid. What if <b>whoever</b> <b>is</b> driving them gets a heart attack?" [...] She was detained by the religious police (CPVPV) on 21 May and released after six hours.

500|$|That night, Theo {{moves into}} Eleanor's room and they fall {{asleep in the}} same bed. [...] Eleanor is awakened by {{the sounds of a}} man {{speaking}} indistinctly and a woman laughing. [...] Fearful, Eleanor asks Theo to hold her hand and she feels it being crushed. As Eleanor hears the sound of a young girl crying, she shouts at <b>whoever</b> <b>is</b> causing the child pain. Theo awakens with a start and turns on the light. Eleanor then sees that she has moved from the bed to the couch, and realizes that Theo was not the one she felt holding her hand.|$|E
500|$|In {{his public}} speaking, Saint-Just {{was even more}} daring and outspoken than his mentor Robespierre. Regarding France's {{internal}} strife, he spared few: “You have to punish not only the traitors, but {{even those who are}} indifferent; you have to punish <b>whoever</b> <b>is</b> passive in the republic, and who does nothing for it.” He thought the only way to create a true republic was to rid it of enemies, to enforce the “complete destruction of its opposite.” Regarding the war, he declared without regret to the Convention, “The vessel of the Revolution can arrive in port only on a sea reddened with torrents of blood.” He urged the deputies to embrace the notion that “a nation generates itself only upon heaps of corpses.” ...|$|E
