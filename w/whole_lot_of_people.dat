2500|$|Nearing {{the end of}} the season, Perry {{continued}} his torrid scoring pace. On March 9, Perry scored two more goals, his 32nd and 33rd goal of the season, surpassing his previous career-high, single-season goal tally. Perry scored another goal in a win against Colorado. In the next game, he scored the only two goals as the Ducks lost to the Phoenix Coyotes. From March 19 through April 6, Perry recorded a least a point in ten consecutive games, later taking the League scoring lead from Steven Stamkos of the Tampa Bay Lightning when he scored two goals against the defending Stanley Cup champion Chicago Blackhawks. He then recorded his third career hat-trick in a game against the San Jose Sharks on April 6, with his third of the game giving him 50 for the year. After reaching the mark, he became just the third Ducks player to record a 50-goal season, joining Teemu Selänne and Paul Kariya. [...] "Fifty is a huge number," [...] Perry said after being serenaded with [...] "M-V-P!" [...] chants from the Honda Center crowd in Anaheim.

40|$|Occupy Wall Street (OWS) {{activism}} in 2011 suddenly tied global cities {{associated with the}} boom times of financial globalization and a world of discontent linked to global dispossession. Doing so most novelly within the affluent urban control centers and partially privatized public spaces of American capitalism, the direct action of the OWS encampments and associated protests also made a global capitalist class – the so-called 1 percent – a new focus for global critique. As Naomi Klein explained {{in a speech to}} OWS activists at Zuccotti Park, there was an important political–geographic shift made manifest in this critique: a shift from a geography of blaming territories – wealthy nation-states – to targeting transnational geographies of class domination. “It seems as if there aren’t any more rich countries, ” she underlined. “Just a <b>whole</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> rich <b>people.</b> People who got rich looting the public wealth and exhausting natural resources around the world. The point is today everyone can see that the system is deeply unjust and careening out of control ” (Klein 2011).

40|$|Nowadays, the {{reputation}} of financial institutions is an important topic in international financial economics.

This thesis provides a framework, which provides information about the relationship between trust and the development of credit and banking in three relevant, historical time periods; the Italian renaissance, the Dutch golden age and eighteenth century England. A wide variety of relevant literature was consulted and compared in order to get a good picture of how the system of credit and banking developed in those time periods as well as to what extent trust could be considered an important factor in this development. It turns out that there is no evidence to prove that people have disliked using credit over the ages, because of the risk credit contains in itself.
