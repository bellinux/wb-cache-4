25|$|Zoroaster {{emphasized}} {{the freedom of}} the individual to choose right or wrong and individual responsibility for one's deeds. This personal choice to accept aša, or arta (the divine order), and shun druj (ignorance and chaos) is one's own decision and not a dictate of Ahura Mazda. For Zarathustra, by thinking good thoughts, saying good words, and doing good deeds (e.g. assisting the needy or doing good works) we increase this divine force aša or arta in the world and in ourselves, celebrate the divine order, and we come a step closer on the everlasting road to being one with the Creator. Thus, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> slaves or servants of Ahura Mazda, but we can make a personal choice to be his co-workers, thereby refreshing the world and ourselves.|$|E
500|$|Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty were {{responsible}} for the concept and production of 1987, its lyrics and the TR-808 beatbox rhythms. Drummond provided rap, and an additional rapper introduced as 'Chike' appears on [...] "Don't Take Five (Take What You Want)" [...] and [...] "Rockman Rock (Parts 2 and 3)". Duy Khiem contributed lead vocals to [...] "Mẹ Ru Con", as well as clarinet and tenor sax to [...] "Rockman Rock (Parts 2 and 3)" [...] and [...] "Next". Uncredited female vocalists on [...] "Hey Hey <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Not</b> <b>The</b> Monkees", [...] "Rockman Rock (Parts 2 & 3)" [...] and [...] "All You Need Is Love (106 bpm)" [...] are identified by one source as Cressida Cauty (Jimmy's wife) and June Montana, the lead vocalists of the KLF Communications side project Disco 2000.|$|E
500|$|The album's opening song, [...] "Hey Hey <b>We</b> <b>Are</b> <b>Not</b> <b>The</b> Monkees", {{begins with}} {{simulated}} human sexual intercourse noises arranged as a rhythm. The album's first sample is [...] "Here we come..." [...] from The Monkees' theme. It progresses into a cryptic and bleak spoken verse from Drummond: [...] "Here we come, crawling {{out of the}} mud, from chaos primeval to the burned out sun, dragging our bad selves {{from one end of}} time, with nothing to declare but some half-written rhymes". A cacophone of further samples from The Monkees' theme and Drummond's voice follow – [...] "We're not The Monkees, I don't even like The Monkees!" [...] – before it gets interrupted by an original a cappella vocal line that later became The KLF's [...] "Justified and Ancient" [...] – [...] "We're justified/And we're ancient ... We don't want to upset the apple cart/And we don't wanna cause any harm".|$|E

2500|$|A police {{document}} {{obtained by}} Reuters in March 2017 listed 423 Rohingyas detained {{by the police}} since 9 October 2016, 13 of whom were children, the youngest being ten years old. Two police captains in Maungdaw verified the document and justified the arrests, {{with one of them}} saying, [...] "We the police have to arrest those who collaborated with the attackers, children or not, but the court will decide if they are guilty; <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> ones who decide." [...] Myanmar police also claimed that the children had confessed to their alleged crimes during interrogations, and that they were not beaten or pressured during questioning. The average age of those detained is 34, the youngest is 10, and the oldest is 75.|$|E
