[...] When asked in November 2007 whether she actively sought out well-known names to fill new roles in the show, series producer Diana Kyle responded: [...] "It's lovely {{when we have a}} new member of the cast come in and bring an audience with them.

[...] The song's producer, Polow da Don, stated in his interview with MTV News that Rihanna's vocal performance was [...] "unique", as well as saying how Brown delivers his rap with a high amount of energy and conviction. Ryan Brockington for the New York Post described Brown's bridge as [...] "bouncy", and wrote that Rihanna's vocals [...] "meshed" [...] perfectly with the lyrics.|$|E
500|$|In {{casting the}} first series of Holby City, Young—who had {{previously}} {{worked on the}} soap operas Brookside and Family Affairs—selected actors who were already established names in the acting industry, particularly from a soap opera background. French had starred in the BBC's EastEnders, while Stephenson and Faulkner had starred in Brookside. Griffin had also appeared in ITV's Coronation Street. Young explained: [...] "Some of the best performances on screen {{have come out of}} soaps in the past few years. There is a fantastic amount of talent on those shows." [...] This propensity for hiring established actors continued as the soap progressed, with former Brookside actress Patricia Potter cast as registrar Diane Lloyd, Star Wars actor Denis Lawson cast as consultant Tom Campbell-Gore, and Family Affairs star Rocky Marshall cast as SHO Ed Keating. Later roles were awarded to comedian Adrian Edmondson, former film actress Patsy Kensit, and Jesus of Nazareth star Powell. When Jane Asher was cast in the recurring role of Lady Byrne in 2007, Inside Soap magazine asked Kyle whether the production team intentionally sought out [...] "well-known-names". She responded: [...] "It's lovely when we have a new member of the cast come in and bring an audience with them. But we <b>want</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> actors, and the star names we cast are always the best – which is why we go for them." ...|$|E

500|$|When {{they first}} {{occupied}} the country, the Germans prohibited {{the activity of}} all Serbian political parties except Zbor. Although they originally intended to make Ljotić {{the head of a}} Serbian puppet government, both Ljotić and the Germans realized that his unpopularity would make any government led by him a failure. The Germans believed that Ljotić had a [...] "dubious reputation among Serbs". Ljotić told Gestapo officer Karl Wilhelm Krause that [...] " [...] uncompromised man with generally recognized authority and force of personality... needed to convince the people that the Germans are their friends, that they <b>want</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> for the people and that they are the saviours of humankind from Communism." [...] The Germans soon invited Ljotić to join the initial Serbian puppet government, the Commissioner Administration of Milan Aćimović. Ljotić was offered the position of economic commissioner but never took office, partly because he disliked the idea of playing a secondary role in the administration and partly because of his unpopularity. He resorted to indirectly exerting his influence over the Serbian puppet government through two of his closest associates, Stevan Ivanić and Miloslav Vasiljević, whom the Germans had selected as commissioners. The only official function Ljotić held in German-occupied Serbia was administrator of Smederevo. He helped in the town's reconstruction after large parts of it were destroyed in an ammunition depot explosion in June 1941.|$|E

2500|$|Gonet is an {{established}} actress in British television, {{known for her}} role in the 1990s BBC series The House of Eliott. Her casting as Jayne follows a trend of Holby City producers towards hiring established British actors - with Gonet joining a series 9 cast alongside former film actress Patsy Kensit as Ward Sister Faye Morton, comedian Adrian Edmondson as Consultant Surgeon Abra Durant and Jesus of Nazareth star Robert Powell as Nursing Consultant Mark Williams. Series creator Mal Young commented on the preference for established names when discussing Holby Citys inception, explaining: [...] "Soap actors are the best actors. There’s been so much snobbery before. The whole thing about typecasting was probably invented by actors who couldn’t get other work. From day one I knew I wanted to put on screen people that viewers want to watch. There’s no downside to that." [...] Series producer Diana Kyle also addressed this trend in November 2007, when asked: [...] "When you cast an actor, do you actively seek out well-known names - like Jane Asher (Lady Byrne) and Patsy Kensit (Faye) - or will a role simply go to whoever's better suited?". She responded to this question: [...] "It's lovely when we have a new member of the cast come in and bring an audience with them.
