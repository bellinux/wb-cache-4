2500|$|Its <b>wholesale</b> <b>banking</b> segment {{contains}} products sold to large- and middle-market commercial companies, {{as well as}} {{to consumers}} on a wholesale basis. This includes lending, treasury management, mutual funds, asset-based lending, commercial real estate, corporate and institutional trust services, and capital markets and investment banking services through Wells Fargo Securities. One area that is very profitable to Wells Fargo, however, is asset-based lending: lending to large companies using accounts receivable and inventory as collateral, though less traditional assets are often included in the collateral package. Historically, this type of lending has been done when normal routes of raising funds, such as the Capital Markets or unsecured bank loans, have been exhausted. The main business unit associated with this activity is Wells Fargo Capital Finance. Wells Fargo also owns Eastdil Secured, which is described as a [...] "real estate investment bank", but is essentially one of the largest commercial real estate brokers for very large transactions (such as the purchase and sale of large Class-A office buildings in central business districts throughout the United States).|$|E
2500|$|The town of Phoenix {{was settled}} in 1867, and {{incorporated}} in 1881 as the City of Phoenix. [...] Phoenix {{served as an}} agricultural area that depended on large-scale irrigation projects. Until World War II, the economy {{was based on the}} [...] "Five C's": cotton, citrus and cattle, climate and copper. [...] The city provided retail, <b>wholesale,</b> <b>banking,</b> and governmental services for central Arizona, and was gaining a national reputation among winter tourists. The post World War Two years saw the city beginning to grow more rapidly, as many men who had trained in the military installations in the valley, returned, bringing their families. [...] The population growth was further stimulated in the 1950s, {{in part because of the}} availability of air conditioning, which made the very hot dry summer heat tolerable, [...] as well as an influx of industry, led by high tech companies. [...] The population growth rate of the Phoenix metro area has been nearly 4% per year for the past 40 years. [...] That growth rate slowed during the Great Recession but the U.S. Census Bureau predicted it would resume as the nation's economy recovered, and it already has begun to do so. While currently ranked 5th largest city in the United States by population, it is predicted that Phoenix will rank 4th by 2020.|$|E
