25|$|On August 10, 2008, Compass-1 entered Emergency mode. The {{cause was}} unknown and FH Aachen {{put out a}} call to all amateur radio {{operators}} {{to try to find}} out <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>on</b> <b>with</b> the CubeSat. A hard reset occurred, only to bring the satellite into a circle of powering up, turning on the heaters, and then dying again. The only way to exit this loop was to avoid starting the heaters. The team needed as much Telemetry from the ground as possible, which was from amateur radio enthusiasts.|$|E

What started out as a lark turned into a riot that resulted in thousands of dollars of damage.|$|E

500|$|MTV's Kevin P. Sullivan {{wrote that}} the episode [...] "jammed in Regionals, {{something}} that used to matter", and did so without any [...] "meaningful buildup to the competition".

[...] Chance loses his virginity to Chloe and they become engaged, though she develops into a [...] "clingy" [...] fiancé. The relationship ends after he cheats on her with Heather Stevens (Eden Riegel). Soon after, Chance fakes his death and enters the Witness Protection Program.
