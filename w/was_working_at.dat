5|$|Although {{initially}} {{viewed as}} an expensive white elephant, within 10years the station <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> capacity (about 600 trains per day) and the GER was acquiring land {{to the east of}} the station for expansion. An Act of Parliament was obtained in 1888 and work started in 1890 on the eastward expansion of Liverpool Street by adding eight new tracks and platforms. This gave the station the most platforms of any London terminus until Victoria station was expanded in 1908.|$|E
5|$|In November 1978, Armstrong <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> {{his farm}} near Lebanon, Ohio.

5|$|There were no Puerto Rican military-related {{fatalities}} in the Japanese {{attack of}} Pearl Harbor. However, {{there was one}} civilian Puerto Rican fatality. Daniel LaVerne was a Puerto Rican amateur boxer who <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> Pearl Harbor's Red Hill underground fuel tank construction project when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. He {{died as a result}} of the injuries which he received during the attack. His name is listed among the 2,338 Americans killed or mortally wounded on December 7, 1941, in the Remembrance Exhibit in the back lawn of the USS Arizona Memorial Visitor Center at Pearl Harbor.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to Purdue, he met Janet Elizabeth Shearon, who was majoring in home economics. According to the couple, {{there was no}} real courtship, and neither could remember the exact circumstances of their engagement, except that it occurred while Armstrong <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> the NACA's Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory. They were married on January 28, 1956, at the Congregational Church in Wilmette, Illinois. When he moved to Edwards Air Force Base, he lived in the bachelor quarters of the base, while Janet lived in the Westwood district of Los Angeles. After one semester, they moved into a house in Antelope Valley. Janet never finished her degree, a fact she regretted later in life.|$|E
5|$|Control of the {{building}} project passed from the Scottish Office to the cross-party Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) on 1 June 1999, headed by the Parliament's then Presiding Officer, Sir David Steel, {{at a time of}} increasing costs. Rising costs sprang from the need for a formal entrance and the need to accommodate parliamentary staff in light of better knowledge of how Parliament <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> its primary location on the Royal Mile, where it was clear there were staff overcrowding problems. With the cost increases in mind, and heightened media interest in the Holyrood Project, the Members of the Scottish Parliament held a debate on whether to continue with construction on 17 June 1999 voting by a majority of 66 to 57 in favour to complete the project.|$|E

5|$|Editor Donald A. Wollheim <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> Avon Books in 1952, but disliked his job. While {{looking for}} other work, he tried to persuade A. A. Wyn to begin a new {{paperback}} publishing company. Wyn was already a well-established publisher of books and pulp magazines under the name A. A. Wyn's Magazine Publishers. His magazines included Ace Mystery and Ace Sports, and it is perhaps from these titles that Ace Books got its name. Wyn liked Wollheim's idea but delayed for several months; meanwhile, Wollheim was applying for other jobs, including assistant editor at Pyramid Books. Pyramid mistakenly called Wyn's wife Rose for a reference, thinking Wollheim had worked for her. When Rose told her husband that Wollheim was applying for another job, Wyn made up his mind: he hired Wollheim immediately as an editor.|$|E
5|$|He quickly formed another {{band called}} Sahara Dust, which later {{developed}} into the symphonic metal band Epica. His place {{was taken by}} Bas Maas, {{who had been the}} guitar technician for After Forever during the tours of 2001 and 2002. August and September 2002 were dedicated to a European tour, supporting Finnish act Nightwish and attending some rock festivals, which exposed the band to larger audiences and gained them even more favourable press. Further media exposure came from Floor Jansen's collaboration with Dutch multi-instrumentalist and composer Arjen Anthony Lucassen, for the recording of Star One's album Space Metal and the subsequent tour in late 2002. Jansen's activities, as well as the regular jobs and studies of the After Forever band members, reduced the band's live performances for the rest of 2002 and half of 2003. It was known that the band <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> a new album from the beginning of 2003, but their first release was the EP Exordium in October 2003, containing an instrumental track, three new songs and two covers.|$|E

The Drew Steele-Skip Holtz Golf Classic benefits citizens of Pitt County with special needs.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, Australia marked 200 {{years since}} its first {{official}} white settlement, established by Captain Arthur Phillip on Sydney Harbour in 1788. While some Indigenous Australians protested the event, {{and referred to}} the occasion as Invasion Day rather than Australia Day, a group of Indigenous artists from Ramingining in the Northern Territory decided to create an artwork to mark the anniversary. The project was initiated by Djon Mundine, an Indigenous art advisor and curator, who <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> Ramingining prior to the Bicentenary. A small group of artists including David Malangi, Paddy Dhathangu, George Milpurrurru and Jimmy Wululu decided {{the form of the}} project, but ultimately 43 artists from the region contributed pieces to the Memorial.|$|E
5|$|Michel's {{older brother}} Albert had already become a patissier (pastry chef), and Roux {{followed}} him into this field {{at the age of}} fourteen. He became an apprentice to Camille Loyal in Belleville, working seventy-hour weeks. Michel's tasks at the pâtisserie included making up to sixty Galette des Rois over the course of three days for Epiphany. Albert found Michel further employment as his apprenticeship ended. As Albert <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> the British Embassy in Paris as a sous chef, Michel joined him there as the pastry chef for the Embassy. He moved on from there to become a chef in Philippe de Rothschild's service, while Albert moved to England to work there. Between 1960 and 1962, Michel served his French National Service. He was first stationed at the Palace of Versailles, but was later posted overseas in Béchar, Algeria. He was awarded the Médaille commémorative des opérations de sécurité et de maintien de l'ordre en Afrique du Nord.|$|E
5|$|On 16 November 1935, the {{contract}} for Flugzeugträger A (Aircraft carrier A)later christened Graf Zeppelinwas {{awarded to the}} Deutsche Werke shipyard in Kiel. Construction of the ship was delayed since Deutsche Werke <b>was</b> <b>working</b> <b>at</b> capacity, and the slipway needed for Graf Zeppelin was occupied by the new battleship , which was launched on 8 December 1936. Work started on Graf Zeppelin on 28 December, when her keel was laid down. She was launched on 8 December 1938, the 24th anniversary of the Battle of the Falkland Islands, and she was christened by Helene von Zeppelin, {{the daughter of the}} ship's namesake. At the launching ceremony, Hermann Göring gave a speech. By the end of 1939, she was 85% complete, with a projected completion by the middle of 1940. By September 1939, one carrier-borne wing, Trägergruppe 186, had been formed by the Luftwaffe at Kiel Holtenau, composed of three squadrons equipped with Bf 109s and Ju-87s.|$|E
