5|$|As {{the chorus}} progresses, Harket's voice hits ever higher notes, {{reaching}} a falsetto {{and hitting the}} song's highest note (E5, the dominant note) at the end. There is a temporary change of markings in the drum pattern in the chorus, <b>where</b> <b>for</b> two bars the drums play in half time, returning to the same rhythm as before for {{the climax of the}} vocal line. A mix of a drum machine, the LinnDrum, acoustic guitars and electronic instrumentation serves as the song's backing track.|$|E

5|$|At a {{time when}} medical {{practice}} was in its infancy, and patients often fared better if left alone, the Christian Science message was a welcome one. In 1882 Eddy set up the Massachusetts Metaphysical College in Boston, <b>where,</b> <b>for</b> $300 for a 12-lesson course, she and her students taught mostly women how to become Christian Science practitioners, licensed to offer Christian Science prayer to the sick. The college made Eddy a wealthy woman; when she died in December 1910 her estate was valued at $1.5 million.|$|E
5|$|For {{several years}} Pink Floyd had busied {{themselves}} with personal pursuits, such as filming and {{competing in the}} La Carrera Panamericana and recording a soundtrack for a film based on the event. In January 1993, they began {{working on a new}} album, returning to Britannia Row Studios, <b>where</b> <b>for</b> several days, Gilmour, Mason and Wright worked collaboratively, improvising material. After about two weeks, the band had enough ideas to begin creating songs. Ezrin returned to co-produce the album and production moved to the Astoria, where from February to May 1993, they worked on about 25 ideas.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, {{in tandem}} with his work at All Souls, Henson acted as tutor to Lyle Rathbone, son of the philanthropic {{businessman}} William Rathbone. The family lived in Birkenhead, <b>where</b> <b>for</b> six months Henson stayed with them. He had ample leisure time, much of which he spent in visiting local churches and nonconformist chapels. This process left him struggling with doctrinal questions, but sure of a religious vocation. The day after his return to Oxford in October 1885 he went into St Mary's, Iffley, and {{with his hand on}} the altar vowed to dedicate himself to God and the Church.|$|E

His later music had acquired a following in Russia, and he received invitations to return there, but decided to stay in Europe.

5|$|Iravan is {{also known}} in Indonesia (where his name is spelled Irawan). An {{independent}} set of traditions have developed around Irawan on the main island of Java <b>where,</b> <b>for</b> example, he loses his association with the Naga. Separate Javanese traditions present a dramatic marriage of Irawan to Titisari, daughter of Krishna, and a death resulting from a case of mistaken identity. These stories are told {{through the medium of}} traditional Javanese theatre (Wayang), especially in shadow-puppet plays known as Wayang Kulit.|$|E

However, due to budgetary concerns, Oregon State University dropped the track and field program in 1988 and the rivalry ended. Their women's program was reinstated in 2004, but since {{they do not have}} a men's program, the rivalry has not yet been renewed.|$|E
5|$|A two-laned Ninth Line curves {{northeast}} after {{crossing and}} being crossed by two separate railway tracks (the Canadian Pacific (CP) Havelock Subdivision and the Canadian National Halton subdivision) and becomes Donald Cousens Parkway, expanding to four lanes and travelling {{along the eastern}} fringe {{of the community of}} Box Grove, alongside which it was built in the mid-2000s. On the west side is a new residential subdivision, while on the east side beyond the CP Havelock subdivision, which the road parallels, is the completely undeveloped Bob Hunter Memorial Park. After passing Box Grove Bypass, <b>where</b> <b>for</b> some time the route ended, the road also becomes known as Box Grove Collector Road (BGCR). The route intersects 14th Avenue (York Regional Road71) and continues as before, eventually curving north and meeting Copper Creek Drive while departing from the railway tracks and park. It passes a supercenter before an interchange with Highway407, where it crosses over the toll route.|$|E

5|$|After Gallipoli the 7th Battalion was {{withdrawn}} to Egypt, where the AIF underwent {{a period of}} reorganisation and expansion prior to being transferred to Europe. The 7th Battalion was split to provide a cadre for the 59th Battalion which was being raised {{as part of the}} doubling of the Australian forces. In March 1916, they sailed to France <b>where</b> <b>for</b> the next two and half years they would take part in the fighting in the trenches along the Western Front. Upon arrival, the battalion was sent to the Somme, where its first major action came in July during the Battle of Pozières. Throughout July and into August, the battalion was committed to the fighting twice, losing 55 men killed in the first battle and another 83 in the second.|$|E
5|$|Antiquarian curiosity in {{the castle}} had begun as early as 1700, when Peter Le Neve visited and {{recorded}} some of the architectural details, but interest increased in the 19th century. This was partially due {{to the work of}} the local curate, the Reverend J. Jackson, who undertook the first archaeological excavations at the site during the 1840s, uncovering many of the foundations of the inner court. 17th and 18th century stained glass windows from the continent were installed in the chapel, where the 15th century wall paintings were rediscovered in 1844. The then owner, Colonel John Houlton, turned the chapel into a museum of curiosities, <b>where</b> <b>for</b> a small fee visitors could see sets of armour, what was said to be a pair of Oliver Cromwell's boots and other English Civil War artefacts, including letters from Cromwell written to the Hungerfords.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} World War II, {{however, the}} {{decision}} was made to establish a permanent standing defence force and the role of Reserve forces was reduced to the point <b>where</b> <b>for</b> a while their relevance was called into question. Recently, however, there has been a move to develop a more capable Reserve force, as Australia's overseas military commitments in the Pacific and Middle East have highlighted the importance of the Reserves once more. As such, since 2000 units of the Australian Army Reserve have been deployed to East Timor and the Solomon Islands on peacekeeping duties and many more individual Reservists have been used to provide specialist capabilities and to fill in Regular Army formations being sent overseas.|$|E

5|$|Lihou is also {{a common}} family name on Guernsey, with records {{suggesting}} that the name has been in use in the Channel Islands {{since at least the}} eighteenth century, including Royal Navy Captain John Lihou, who discovered and named the Australian Port Lihou Island and Lihou Reef. The name {{is also a}}ttested further afield, {{in a number of other}} countries such as Australia, <b>where</b> <b>for</b> example, Sergeant James Lihou, the son of a migrant from Guernsey, enlisted in the Australian forces in 1916 and was killed in action in 1918 in France. There are also numerous instances of people with the surname having migrated from the Channel Islands to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Modern animal {{husbandry}} relies on production systems {{adapted to the}} type of land available. Subsistence farming is being superseded by intensive animal farming in the more developed parts of the world, <b>where</b> <b>for</b> example beef cattle are kept in high density feedlots, and thousands of chickens may be raised in broiler houses or batteries. On poorer soil such as in uplands, animals are often kept more extensively, and may be allowed to roam widely, foraging for themselves. Most livestock are herbivores, except for the pig which is an omnivore. Ruminants like cattle and sheep are adapted to feed on grass; they can forage outdoors, or may be fed entirely or in part on rations richer in energy and protein, such as pelleted cereals. Pigs and poultry cannot digest the cellulose in forage, and require cereals and other high-energy foods.|$|E

She returned to this general area yet again 29 August, when she fired in an amphibious demonstration staged behind enemy lines to ease pressure on the Republic of Korea's troops. The next day she started a three-day saturation of the Changjon area, with one of her own helicopters spotting the results: four buildings destroyed, road junctions smashed, railroad marshaling yards afire, tracks cut and uprooted, coal stocks scattered, and many buildings and warehouses set blazing.|$|E
