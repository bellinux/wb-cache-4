5|$|The tiger (Panthera tigris) is {{the largest}} cat species, most {{recognizable}} for their pattern of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. The species is classified in the genus Panthera with the lion, leopard, jaguar, and snow leopard. Tigers are apex predators, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and bovids. They are territorial and generally solitary but social animals, often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support their prey requirements. This, coupled <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> they are indigenous {{to some of the}} more densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.|$|E

40|$|How {{much can}} we turn the screw on counter-examples to the KK principle?

One can know that P, and believe that one knows that P, without knowing that one knows that P, because one is not in a strong enough epistemic position to know that one knows that P (Williamson 2000 : 114 - 30). One’s epistemic position is weaker <b>with</b> respect to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> one knows that P than it is <b>with</b> respect to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> P itself.

Of course, if one does know that P, one’s epistemic position <b>with</b> respect to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> one knows that P cannot be so bad that one positively knows that one does not know that P, as opposed to merely failing to know that one knows that P, for knowing is 1 factive: one can know only what is indeed the case.

5|$|An empty matrix is {{a matrix}} {{in which the}} number of rows or columns (or both) is zero. Empty {{matrices}} help dealing with maps involving the zero vector space. For example, if A is a 3-by-0 matrix and B is a 0-by-3 matrix, then AB is the 3-by-3 zero matrix corresponding to the null map from a 3-dimensional space V to itself, while BA is a 0-by-0 matrix. There is no common notation for empty matrices, but most computer algebra systems allow creating and computing with them. The determinant of the 0-by-0 matrix is 1 as follows from regarding the empty product occurring in the Leibniz formula for the determinant as 1. This value is also consistent <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the identity map from any finite dimensional space to itself has determinant1, a fact that is often used {{as a part of}} the characterization of determinants.|$|E
