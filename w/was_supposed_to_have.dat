5|$|At the Battle of Essling, Moustache <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> found a mate. Upon {{joining the}} front lines, a fellow Poodle was spotted amongst the enemy. During {{the course of}} the battle, the two met and the female Poodle {{accompanied}} Moustache back to the French camp. This relationship lasted about a year and together the pair produced puppies which were looked after by the women of the camp.|$|E
5|$|Generally, the {{organization}} of JG 1 followed the standard Luftwaffe organization for any typical wing (Geschwader). It was commanded by a Geschwaderkommodore, equivalent to a USAAF Wing Commander or RAF Group Captain. A Geschwaderkommodore <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the rank of Lieutenant Colonel (Oberstleutnant) or Colonel (Oberst), but the position could be filled by a relatively junior officer.|$|E
5|$|In Tlingit and Haida cultures, raven {{was both}} a trickster and creator god. Related beliefs are {{widespread}} among the peoples of Siberia and northeast Asia. The Kamchatka Peninsula, for example, <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been created by the raven god Kutkh. There are several references to common ravens in the Old Testament of the Bible {{and it is an}} aspect of Mahakala in Bhutanese mythology.|$|E

5|$|Machinery {{problems}} {{were likely to}} delay the ships well past their intended delivery dates of 1943–44. Three turbines were delivered by Brown Boveri in 1939 to Arkhangelsk for the Sovetskaya Rossiya, but the Kharkhovskii Turbogenerator Works never completed a single turbine before the German invasion in June 1941. A prototype boiler <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been built ashore for evaluation, {{but it was not}} completed until early 1941, which further complicated the production plan.|$|E
5|$|Andersen {{was accused}} of crimes on several {{occasions}} in the post-war years, but was most often acquitted in court. Amongst the crimes {{of which he was}} charged but acquitted in court was the theft of building materials in 1954. Another time he was tricked into lending his car to two people who broke into a goldsmith's shop in Tønsberg. Strongly intoxicated {{at the time of the}} crime, he was charged but fully acquitted. In 1955 he was, however, convicted and sentenced to 36days in prison for selling 30bottles of denatured alcohol, alcohol that <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been used at his factory.|$|E
5|$|Eventually {{a little}} after noon Wilton arrived at the inquest, and gave a full account of the incident. Lord Granville (half-brother of the Marquess of Stafford) told the jury that Huskisson had been {{suffering}} from numbness in his leg from a previous operation, and that this may have caused his apparent problems with movement. No witnesses recollected seeing any signal flags raised {{from any of the}} locomotives involved, including Rocket, although a system of warning flags <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been in place.|$|E

5|$|In 1797, Emerald was one {{of several}} vessels sent to hunt down and capture the {{crippled}} Santisima Trinidad, which had escaped from the British at the Battle of Cape St Vincent. Emerald <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been present at the Battle of the Nile but in May 1798 a storm separated her from Horatio Nelson's squadron and she arrived in Aboukir Bay nine days too late. She was part of Rear-Admiral John Thomas Duckworth's squadron during the Action of 7 April 1800 off Cadiz.|$|E
5|$|On 9 November, the U.S. troops {{continued}} with {{their attempt to}} encircle Shōji's forces. On the west of Gavaga Creek, 1/7 and 2/164 extended their positions inland along the creek while 2/7 and other 164th troops took positions {{on the east side}} of Shōji's positions. The Americans began to compress the pocket while subjecting it to constant bombardment by artillery, mortars, and aircraft. A gap, however, existed by way of a swampy creek in the southern side of the American lines, which 2/164 <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> closed. Taking advantage of this route, Shōji's men began to escape the pocket.|$|E
5|$|The {{attempts}} of the Mortaras {{and their allies}} to identify who <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> baptised Edgardo quickly bore fruit. After their present servant Anna Facchini adamantly denied any involvement, they considered former employees and soon earmarked Morisi as a possible candidate. In late July 1858 the Mortara home was visited by Ginerva Scagliarini, a friend of Morisi's who had once worked for Marianna's brother-in-law Cesare De Angelis. Marianna's brother Angelo Padovani tested Scagliarini by saying falsely {{that he had heard}} it was Morisi who had baptised Edgardo. The ruse worked—Scagliarini said that she had been told the same thing by Morisi's sister Monica.|$|E

5|$|The manga was {{licensed}} for English-language distribution by ADV Manga, which released five volumes between 2005 and 2007. Volume six <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{been released}} in February 2008, but was delayed indefinitely {{in order to}} focus on ADV's core business of anime. At New York Comic Con 2009, Yen Press announced that it had acquired the North American license for the series; it reprinted the first five volumes with new translations along with volume six in September 2009, and is continuing with later volumes.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{budget was}} quickly surpassed, {{and back in}} Los Angeles, Wasserman grew increasingly frustrated. He was regularly confronting Ned Tanen, the executive in charge of production for Universal, in person over the costs. Sean Daniel, another studio executive, was not reassured {{when he came to}} Chicago and saw the production had set up a special facility for the 70 cars used in the chase sequences. Filming there, which <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> concluded in the middle of September, continued into late October.|$|E
5|$|Bond beats Le Chiffre at {{the poker}} table, but Lynd is kidnapped by Le Chiffre after the game, as is Bond, who is {{captured}} whilst pursuing them; Lynd is ransomed {{for the money}} and Bond is tortured. Le Chiffre is subsequently killed by Mr. White, a liaison between Le Chiffre {{and a number of}} his clients. Bond learns that his poker winnings were never repaid to the Treasury, which Lynd <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> done, and Bond establishes that she was a double agent. Bond pursues her and is attacked by members of White's organisation: he survives, but White takes the money and Lynd sacrifices herself in exchange for Bond's life, as he later finds out from M. Bond subsequently finds and captures White.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Thảo's main partner Phát headed towards Tan Son Nhut Air Base — the country's {{military}} headquarters — {{to capture}} {{it with an}} assortment of marines, paratroopers and special forces troops. At the time, most of the senior officers had been in meetings with American officials at Tan Son Nhut {{since the start of the}} morning, and Khánh left at 12:30. The plotters had secured the cooperation of someone working inside the Joint General Staff headquarters. This collaborator <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> closed the gate so Khánh would be held up, but left them open. Some of the other senior officers in the Armed Forces Council were not so lucky, and were caught by Phát's troops inside headquarters, while other buildings in the complex remained under junta control.|$|E
5|$|John Bevan {{had asked}} Newman Smith {{to retain the}} threat of a US {{invasion}} force beyond 28 June when the initial deception <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> ended. Agent Rudloff sent messages on 10, 12 and 18 July referring to the Ironside force. In mid-July, the Allies began Operation Ferdinand, a cover deception for Operation Dragoon, the August 1944 invasion of southern France. The Ironside story was considered as an option in support of Ferdinand, but Noel Wild and Ops (B), the SHAEF deception planners were worried about the impact of a theoretical US invasion force on the continuing Fortitude deception. It was decided that a new story would be presented to the Germans, suggesting that the Allies intended to bolster French resistance in the south of the country. The operation went largely unnoticed and German interest in the Bordeaux region dissipated.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Parachute Brigade had a {{secondary}} objective of capturing Le Muy. It <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been assaulted by the 4th Parachute Battalion with the 5th (Scottish) Parachute Battalion providing fire support. With the forces {{he had at}} hand, Pritchard was unable {{to carry out the}} task. The objective was then given to the 550th Glider Infantry Battalion, which had arrived with the second wave of aircraft. At 02:15 16 August the American battalion moved through the British positions and assaulted the village. The village was defended in strength by the Germans and the attack failed, causing several casualties to the Americans. A second attempt at 11:40 was more successful, killing or wounding 300 Germans and taking 700 prisoners.|$|E

5|$|After King John's {{death in}} October 1216, Neville {{and his son}} made their peace with the new king, HenryIII, John's son. Both men had their lands {{restored}} in 1217, but the offices that the elder Neville had held were not returned quickly. Custody of some royal forests was returned by 1220, but the office of Chief Forester was not returned until some time later. In 1218 Neville <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had the forest of Rockingham returned to his custody, but William de Forz, the Count of Aumale, refused to return it. It was not until 1220 that de Neville managed to recover his custody of Rockingham forest. By 1224 Neville was once more Chief Forester, but he never regained the power and influence that he had held under John. When he lost the office {{for the second time}} is unclear. The historian C. R. Young states that he held the office until his death in 1234 when it passed to his son John, but Daniel Crook, writing in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, claims that Neville lost the forester office in 1229, to be replaced by John of Monmouth and Brian de Lisle. He also served as Sheriff of Lincolnshire.|$|E
5|$|Carlo Maggi, a Catholic {{acquaintance}} of Momolo's {{who was also}} a retired judge, sent a report of Lepori's refutation to Scazzocchio, who asked Antonelli to pass it on to the Pope. A cover letter attached to Maggi's statement described it as proof that Morisi's story was false. Scazzocchio also forwarded an affidavit from the Mortara family doctor, Pasquale Saragoni, who acknowledged that Edgardo had fallen sick when he was about a year old, but stated that he had never been in danger of dying, and that in any case Morisi had been herself bedridden at the time she <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> baptised the boy. A further report sent from Bologna in October 1858, comprising the statements of eight women and one man, all Catholics, corroborated the doctor's claims about the sicknesses of Edgardo and Morisi respectively, and alleged that the former maid was given to theft and sexual impropriety. Four women, including the servant Anna Facchini and the woman who had employed Morisi after she left the Mortaras, Elena Pignatti, claimed that Morisi had regularly flirted with Austrian officers and invited them into her employers' homes for sex.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{principal}} French diversionary operations during 1806 was by a force that {{had been sent to}} sea in October 1805 as a diversion during the Trafalgar campaign, which by then was almost over. Sailing from Lorient to West Africa, L'Hermite <b>was</b> <b>supposed</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been reinforced by a squadron under Jérôme Bonaparte and attack and capture British forts on the West African coast, thus forcing the detachment of British forces from the main campaign in pursuit. The events {{of the end of the}} Trafalgar campaign cancelled these plans, and the scheduled reinforcements were instead attached to Willaumez's squadron. Despite this setback, L'Hermite continued with elements of the original plan and attacked British merchant ships and slave ships off West Africa during the spring of 1806, inflicting some local damage but failing to capture a trading post or to affect the wider strategic situation. In June, L'Hermite sailed to Cayenne for supplies and then returned to Europe the following month, encountering part of the British blockade squadron under Rear-Admiral Thomas Louis on his return and losing the frigate Président.|$|E
