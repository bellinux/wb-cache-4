5|$|On 13 October 1930, {{representatives of}} the Official German Burial Service in Belgium, the Belgian <b>War</b> <b>Graves</b> Commission and the Imperial <b>War</b> <b>Graves</b> Commission met in Brussels to discuss the status of mixed British-German cemeteries in Belgium. In particular, they met to discuss the status of cemeteries {{established}} by Germans during the war {{where the majority of}} those buried in the cemetery were German. This meeting was brought about because the Imperial <b>War</b> <b>Graves</b> Commission had begun altering the layout of cemeteries containing a high percentage concentration of German dead and began replacing the existing headstones on the Commonwealth graves with the standardized Imperial <b>War</b> <b>Graves</b> Commission headstones, all without first consulting with the German Burial Service in Belgium. The German delegation hoped to retain the established design character of the cemeteries but were ultimately unsuccessful. Control for the cemetery was immediately passed to the Imperial <b>War</b> <b>Graves</b> Commission and further German contribution was limited to providing headstones for a number of graves that were lacking markers. Now that the Imperial <b>War</b> <b>Graves</b> Commission was in full control of the cemetery they immediately set about redesigning it, assigning the task to Assistant Architect William Harrison Cowlishaw. In 1933 Fritz Schult, Chief of the Official German Burial Service in Belgium, wrote to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin to request that the Imperial <b>War</b> <b>Graves</b> Commission be approached to take control over other split British-German cemeteries such as those at Marcinelle New Communal Cemetery and Hautrage Military Cemetery. The Imperial <b>War</b> <b>Graves</b> Commission was maintaining the German graves at St. Symphorien at no cost to Germany and Schult believed it favorable to transfer management of other cemeteries if the Imperial <b>War</b> <b>Graves</b> Commission would assume all maintenance costs for those cemeteries as well.|$|E
5|$|For the Canadian Corps, {{participation}} in the Battle of Mount Sorrel is commemorated with the Hill 62 (Sanctuary Wood) Memorial. The nearby Sanctuary Wood Museum Hill 62 contains a preserved/simulated section of front line trenches occupied by the British and Canadians between 1916 and 1917. Allied soldiers killed during the battle are buried in the nearby Sanctuary Wood Commonwealth <b>War</b> <b>Graves</b> Commission Cemetery, Hooge Crater Commonwealth <b>War</b> <b>Graves</b> Commission Cemetery, Maple Copse Commonwealth <b>War</b> <b>Graves</b> Commission Cemetery and Lijssenthoek Military Cemetery. Those killed during the battle with no known resting place are commemorated on the Menin Gate in Ypres, Belgium. The Royal Regiment of Canada conducts a Sorrel Day parade, open to the public, at the Fort York Armoury every year on the second Sunday in June.|$|E

5|$|After the war the British {{discovered}} Ball's grave, {{which had}} been behind enemy lines, in the Annoeullin Cemetery. In December 1918, personnel of No. 207 Squadron RAF erected a new cross {{in place of the}} one left by the Germans. The Imperial <b>War</b> <b>Graves</b> Commission (now Commonwealth <b>War</b> <b>Graves</b> Commission) were working at the time to consolidate the British <b>war</b> <b>graves</b> into fewer cemeteries; 23 British bodies in graves in the location where Ball was buried were moved to the Cabaret Rouge British Cemetery, but at his father's request Ball's grave was allowed to remain. Albert Sr. paid for a private memorial to be erected over Ball's grave, No. 643, in what later became the Annoeullin Communal Cemetery and German Extension. Ball's is the only British grave from the First World War in this extension, the rest being German. Ball's father also bought the French field where his son had died and erected a memorial stone on the crash site.|$|E

5|$|In September 1918, Holden {{transferred}} to the Imperial <b>War</b> <b>Graves</b> Commission (now the Commonwealth <b>War</b> <b>Graves</b> Commission) with the new rank of major. From 1918 until 1928 he worked on 69 Commission cemeteries. Initially, Holden ran the drawing office and worked as the senior design architect under the three principal architects in France and Belgium (Edwin Lutyens, Reginald Blomfield and Herbert Baker). Holden worked on the experimental war cemetery at Louvencourt and, according to Geurst and Karol, probably on the one at Forceville that {{was selected as the}} prototype for all that followed.|$|E

5|$|In contrast, the {{construction}} of war cemeteries, graves and their associated memorials were typically placed {{under the control of}} a central state authority. The Imperial <b>War</b> <b>Graves</b> Commission (IWGC) took on this role for Britain and her empire. The Commissione nazionale per la onoranze ai caduti di guerra in Italy coordinated the military repatriation of bodies and {{the construction}} of cemeteries. The German <b>war</b> <b>graves</b> commission, the Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge (VDK), was established in 1919, and took strict control over the creation and style of German war cemeteries. The American Battle Monuments Commission oversaw US military graves in a similar fashion.|$|E
5|$|The Commonwealth <b>War</b> <b>Graves</b> Commission (CWGC) is an {{intergovernmental}} organisation of six independent member states whose principal {{function is to}} mark, record and maintain the graves and places of commemoration of Commonwealth of Nations military service members {{who died in the}} two World Wars. The Commission is also responsible for commemorating Commonwealth civilians who {{died as a result of}} enemy action during World War II. The Commission was founded by Fabian Ware and constituted through Royal Charter in 1917 named the Imperial <b>War</b> <b>Graves</b> Commission. The change to the present name took place in 1960.|$|E
5|$|The St Symphorien Military Cemetery is a First World War Commonwealth <b>War</b> <b>Graves</b> Commission {{burial ground}} in Saint-Symphorien, Belgium.

The cemetery was established by the German Army on land donated by Jean Houzeau de Lehaie. It was initially designed as a woodland cemetery before being redesigned by William Harrison Cowlishaw after the Imperial <b>War</b> <b>Graves</b> Commission took over maintenance of the cemetery after the war.|$|E
