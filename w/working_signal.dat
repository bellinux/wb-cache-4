50|$|As {{part of an}} {{investment}} deal with Clear Channel Communications, XM agreed to simulcast some of Clear Channel's FM radio stations until {{they were able to}} afford their own programming. MIX was one of those channels, simulcasting KHMX from Houston, Texas, titled Mix 96.5. Due to low subscription count at the time, the audience didn't concern themselves with the Houston locality of the station. XM's priority was getting the <b>working</b> <b>signal</b> into people's homes and vehicles. Eventually, Clear Channel began to slowly divest from XM, and the stocks diluted, so the Clear Channel FM simulcasts went away.|$|E
50|$|The {{station and}} its goods yard were opened on 17 June 1863 as the Llanrwst {{terminus}} of the Conway and Llanrwst Railway {{that was taken}} over by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) in 1867 and extended to Betws-y-Coed in 1869. To accommodate the southward extension, the station was resited on 6 April 1868. This station was renamed Llanrwst and Trefriw in April 1884, reverting to its original name Llanrwst during the British Railways era, on 6 May 1974. The grade-II station buildings are largely intact, though mostly disused, and there is a <b>working</b> <b>signal</b> box north of the station at which trains must stop to exchange tokens. The extensive station yard is now used for light industry.|$|E
40|$|WO 200186847 A UPAB: 20020521 NOVELTY - A {{low rate}} test signal (3) is {{generated}} by a transmitter (3. 1) in a narrow frequency range above the highest transmission frequency used. It carries coded identification information and is used for quality testing and network management. The test signal is frequency multiplexed with the <b>working</b> <b>signal</b> (2) by electrical addition. It is coupled into the optical transmission network (1) as a composite signal (4). After completing an optical transmission path (1. m) to another network node or element (1. n) the test signal (3) is coupled out, demodulated and decoded. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The information content is used to identify the signal. The control signal is assessed conventionally for its quality. This is employed to deduce {{the quality of the}} <b>working</b> <b>signal,</b> there being a direct relationship between the two qualities. USE - To identify channels separated by wavelength, and determine their quality, in optical transmission systems. For network quality testing and management. ADVANTAGE - At the same time as determining channel identity and quality, if appropriate, signaling information can be transmitted with the <b>working</b> <b>signal,</b> to network components. Optical circuit functionality is verified and network management information is transmitted between individual components, or between components and network management system...|$|E

40|$|In optical {{dedicated}} path protection (1 1), {{the same}} optical signal is transmitted along both working and backup paths. Thus, in 1 1, the transmission parameters {{need to be}} configured {{according to the most}} impaired path, e. g., the backup one. This implies that the <b>working</b> <b>signal</b> is typically served with higher than necessary quality of transmission and occupies larger than necessary spectrum resources, leading to inefficient network resource utilization. In this study, we propose to apply the recently introduced signal overlap technique to improve network efficiency of optical dedicated path protection. The signal overlap technique enables uncorrelated optical signals to be superimposed along the same spectrum resources. It relies on a cancellation detection strategy also exploited in wireless communications and recently applied on coherent optical receivers. In particular, this study summarizes the key aspect and transmission performance of the overlap technique and discusses its implementation complexity. Then, two signal overlap schemes, namely, <b>working</b> <b>signal</b> overlap and working and backup signal overlap are introduced for effective optical dedicated path protection. An integer linear programming (ILP) formulation based on the routing, modulation, and spectrum allocation problem and an efficient heuristic are then presented to effectively assess the performance of the proposed overlap-based 1 1 protection strategy under various topologies and traffic profiles. In the considered simulative scenarios (e. g., network diameters well below a thousand kilometers), results show that the more efficient working and backup signal overlap scheme significantly improves the accepted load of dedicated protection requests.

Chiller used for high cooling load, so that required not too much refrigerant and changing with water to cooled the room In this research is used refrigerant R- 134 a as a secondary refrigerant on an evaporator to chill water. Being chilly, the water is then pumped into the coil - the Fan Coil Unit (FCU) coil – so as to cool down the temperature of an area. This work varies evaporator output temperature and maintains condenser temperature constant. These treatments aim at discovering a compressor’s <b>working</b> <b>signal</b> and coefficient of performance (COP) of a refrigerant vapour compression system on an air-cooled chiller testing device by employing the refrigerant R- 134 a. According to the research, it can be explained that the high capacity on temperature of condensation 27 oC, the high capacity of compressor on condensation temperature 31 oC and the high capacity of coefficient of performance on condensation temperature 27 oC. Therefore, with knowing the characteristic of hermetic compressor, it can make easily the designer to design the air-conditioning system. ...|$|E
40|$|Orthogonal {{frequency}} division multiplexing (OFDM) based systems {{are susceptible to}} radio front end induced impairments. These impairments caused by {{as a consequence of}} imbalances in the In-phase (I) and Quadrature-phase (Q) branches. IQ imbalances are worries to be addressed for the Superhetrodyne and the zero IF architectures in analog domain. The zero-IF architecture is a prospective solution to include multiple RF standards while making straightforward the design and dropping overall costs. However in the practical implementation of the zero-IF receiver architecture IQ imbalance has been {{recognized as one of the}} most serious concerns. At the receiver the expected <b>working</b> <b>signal</b> to noise ratio (SNR) can be affected heavily by the presence of IQ imbalance. As a result of this imbalance the data rates and the supported constellation are also affected. In this thesis the effect of IQ imbalance on OFDM receivers is considered and digital methods are proposed to tackle the effect of IQ imbalance and enhance the operating signal to noise ratio (SNR). The methods are the least square (LS) and the least mean algorithm (LMS). With the help of computer simulation we are going to study the performance of both reduction techniques. The bit error rate (BER) Verses signal to noise ratio (SNR) result could indicate the proposed techniques provide sufficient improved performance...|$|E

50|$|Lines {{that are}} {{equipped}} with bi-directional signalling can operate normally since the signalling equipment is already in place to permit trains to run in either direction over the single line. However, when a section of line which is not normally bi-directional has {{to be used in}} both directions, special procedures are needed to ensure safe operation. In single-line <b>working,</b> <b>signals</b> are usually provided for the right-direction of travel but not in the wrong-direction. The worst safety risk is a head-on collision between two trains travelling in opposite directions, but there is also the risk of a rear-end collision if two trains travel simultaneously over the line in the unsignalled direction.|$|R

40|$|Audio signal preamplifiers (preamps) {{represent}} the low-level {{end of the}} dynamic range of practical audio circuits using modern IC devices. In general, amplifying stages with input signal levels of 10 mV or less fall into the preamp category. This section discusses some basic types of audio preamps, which are: ■ Microphone — including preamps for dynamic, electret and phantom powered microphones, using transformer input circuits, operating from dual and single supplies. ■ Phonograph — including preamps for moving magnet and moving coil phono cartridges in various topologies, with detailed response analysis and discussion. In general, when <b>working</b> <b>signals</b> drop {{to a level of}} ≈ 1 mV, the input noise generated by the first system amplifying stage becomes critical for wide dynamic range and good signal-to-noise ratio. For example, if internally generated noise of an input stage is 1 µV and the input signal voltage 1 mV, the best signal-to-noise ratio possible is just 60 dB. In a given application, both the input voltage level and impedance of a source are usually fixed. Thus, for best signal-to-noise ratio, the input noise generated by the first amplifying stage must be minimized when operated from the intended source. This facto...|$|R
