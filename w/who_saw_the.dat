50|$|Those who {{supported}} {{the ideology of the}} National Revolution rather than the person of Pétain himself could be divided, in general, into three groups: the counter-revolutionary reactionaries; the supporters of a French fascism; and <b>the</b> reformers <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> in <b>the</b> new regime in opportunity to modernize the state apparatus. The last current would include opportunists such as the journalist Jean Luchaire <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> in <b>the</b> new regime career opportunities.|$|R

5|$|According to Sharaf, 1934–1937 was {{the happiest}} period of Reich's {{personal}} life, despite the professional problems. His relationship with Elsa Lindenberg {{was good and}} he considered marrying her. When she became pregnant in 1935, they were initially overjoyed, buying clothes and furniture for the child, but doubts developed for Reich, <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> future as too unsettled. To Lindenberg's great distress, Sharaf writes, Reich insisted on an abortion, at that time illegal. They went to Berlin, where the psychoanalyst Edith Jacobson helped to arrange it.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the ministers}} heading congregations {{in the area}} {{attended}} the Seneca Falls Convention, but none spoke out during the sessions, not even when comments from the floor were invited. On Sunday, July 23, many who had attended, and more who had not, attacked the Convention, the Declaration of Sentiments, and the resolutions. Women in the congregations reported to Stanton, <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> actions of the ministers as cowardly; in their congregations, {{no one would be}} allowed to reply.|$|E

5|$|The Mexican {{interior}} ministry banned the film {{because of a}} series of burglaries mimicking its heist scene. Rififi was banned in Finland in the late 1950s. In answer to critics <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> film as an educational process that taught people how to commit burglary, Dassin claimed the film showed how difficult it was to actually carry out a crime.|$|E
5|$|The {{order was}} placed with ABB Strømmen and AEG in August 1991. The high {{development}} cost was subsidised by the Norwegian government, <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> project as potentially establishing a new industrial export product. Electrical components were built by AEG in Berlin, while the bogies were built by MAN in Nuremberg. The bodywork was built at Strømmen, with profiles from Alusuisse, and the trains were assembled in Strømmen.|$|E

5|$|An {{example of}} someone {{following}} his conscience {{to the point}} of accepting the consequence of being condemned to death is Sir Thomas More (1478-1535)]]. A theologian who wrote on the distinction between the 'sense of duty' and the 'moral sense', as two aspects of conscience, and <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> former as some feeling that can only be explained by a divine Lawgiver, was John Henry Cardinal Newman. A well known saying of him is that he would first toast on his conscience and only then on the pope, since his conscience brought him to acknowledge the authority of the pope.|$|E
5|$|Franklin Pierce (November 23, 1804October 8, 1869) was the 14th President of the United States (1853–57). Pierce was a {{northern}} Democrat <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> abolitionist {{movement as a}} fundamental threat to {{the unity of the}} nation. His polarizing actions in championing and signing the Kansas–Nebraska Act and enforcing the Fugitive Slave Act alienated anti-slavery groups while failing to stem conflict between North and South setting the stage for Southern secession and the American Civil War. Historians and other scholars generally rank Pierce among the worst of U.S. Presidents.|$|E

5|$|In early 1916, UB-7 and UB-8 {{were still}} {{cruising}} in the Black Sea out of Varna. The Germans {{did not have}} good luck in the Black Sea, which was not a priority for them. The Bulgarians, <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> value of the submarines in repelling Russian attacks, began negotiations to purchase UB-7 and UB-8. Bulgarian sailors practiced in the pair of boats and technicians were sent to Kiel for training at the German submarine school there. The transfer of UB-8 to the Bulgarian Navy took place on 25 May 1916, but for reasons unreported in sources, UB-7 remained under the German flag.|$|E
5|$|Jan Henryk Dąbrowski, {{a former}} {{high-ranking}} {{officer in the}} army of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, began his work in 1796– a year after the total destruction of the Commonwealth. At that time he went to Paris, and later, Milan, where his idea received support from Napoleon Bonaparte, <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Poles as a promising source of new recruits, and who superficially appeared receptive to the idea of liberating Poland. Dąbrowski was soon authorized by the French-allied Cisalpine Republic to create the Polish Legions, which would be part of {{the army of the}} newly created Republic of Lombardy. This agreement, drafted by Napoleon, was signed on 9 January 1797, and marked the formal creation of the Legions.|$|E
5|$|Later, Mulder discovers Harold {{in a room}} {{accessible}} {{from the}} bowling alley. The walls of the room are covered with score sheets, {{including those of the}} victims. Mulder realizes that Harold met each of the murdered women at the bowling alley. Harold lapses into a strange seizure, and from his point of view, sees Angie's ghost standing behind Mulder. He rushes {{out of the room and}} makes his way to the bowling alley, where Angie lies dead from a heart attack. Mulder tells Scully that every person <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> apparitions was about to die, implying that Harold may be next. Scully, who also saw a victim's ghost, is struck by the implication.|$|E

5|$|Lobengula impassively acquiesced to the {{expedition}} {{at the behest}} of his friend Jameson, much to the fury of many of the izinDuna, <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> column's march to Mashonaland as an appropriation of Matabele territory. Led by Major Frank Johnson and the famed hunter Frederick Courteney Selous, and escorted by 500 British South Africa Company's Police under Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Pennefather, the pioneers skirted their way around Lobengula's heartlands, heading north-east from Bechuanaland and then north, and founded Fort Tuli, Fort Victoria and Fort Charter along the way. They stopped {{at the site of the}} future capital, Fort Salisbury (named after the Prime Minister), on 12 September 1890, and ceremonially raised the Union Jack the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Mark Antony was {{amassing}} political support, but Octavian {{still had}} opportunity to rival {{him as the}} leading member of the faction supporting Caesar. Mark Antony had lost the support of many Romans and supporters of Caesar when he initially opposed the motion to elevate Caesar to divine status. Octavian failed to persuade Antony to relinquish Caesar's money to him. During the summer, he managed to win support from Caesarian sympathizers, however, <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> younger heir as the lesser evil and hoped to manipulate him, or to bear with him during their efforts {{to get rid of}} Antony.|$|E
5|$|The Bolton Wanderers club badge {{consists}} of the initials of the club {{in the shape of}} a ball, with a red scroll and Lancashire rose underneath. The current badge is a reimagining of one designed in 1975; this was replaced in 2001 by a badge which retained the recognisable initials but controversially exchanged the scroll and rose for blue and red ribbons. The re-design has been welcomed by fans <b>who</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> ribbons as a poor choice. The original club badge was the town crest of Bolton, a key feature of which was the Elephant and Castle motif with the town motto – Supera Moras. This feature has been reincorporated into more recent club shirts.|$|E
