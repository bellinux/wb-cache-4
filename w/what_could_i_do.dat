25|$|The {{morning that}} his {{resignation}} took effect, the President, with Mrs. Nixon and their family, said {{farewell to the}} White House staff in the East Room. A helicopter carried them from the White House to Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. Nixon later wrote that he thought, “As the helicopter moved on to Andrews, I found myself thinking not of the past, but of the future. <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> now?” At Andrews, {{he and his family}} boarded Air Force One to El Toro Marine Corps Air Station in California, and then were transported to his home La Casa Pacifica in San Clemente.|$|E
2500|$|<b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> – {{a foolish}} girl – {{in spite of}} all I could say or do – would come after me – or rather went before me – for I found her here... I could not exactly play the Stoic with a woman – who had {{scrambled}} eight hundred miles to unphilosophize me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Waldheim {{called the}} {{allegations}} [...] "pure lies and malicious acts". In a telex to Bronfman, {{he said that}} his past had been “deliberately misinterpreted.” Nevertheless, he admitted that he had known about German reprisals against partisans: [...] "Yes, I knew. I was horrified. But <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> I had either to continue to serve or be executed." [...] He said that he had never fired a shot or even seen a partisan. His former immediate superior at the time stated that Waldheim had [...] "remained confined to a desk".|$|E
6000|$|GRAND DUCHESS. Well, I {{offered to}} {{cauterize}} {{it with the}} poker in the office stove. But he was afraid. <b>What</b> more <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> {{possibly}} <b>do</b> to John Constantine that hadn't {{been done}} before? And one {{course of action}} suddenly stood out above all others: Kill him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush!" [...] {{said the}} magician, in a whisper; [...] "I {{told you that}} you should see <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> HAVE MADE YOU INVISIBLE; be quiet, and you shall see some more tricks that I shall play with these fellows." ...|$|R

His former immediate superior at the time stated that Waldheim had [...] "remained confined to a desk". Former Austrian chancellor Bruno Kreisky, of Jewish origin, denounced the actions of the World Jewish Congress as an [...] "extraordinary infamy", adding that Austrians would not [...] "allow the Jews abroad to ... tell us who should be our President." ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{perfectly}} right {{that she should}} think of me, but <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> in my ignorance of Mr. Razumov's quarters.|$|E
60|$|MAGGIE. <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> with a silk? [With {{a gust of}} passion] You {{might as}} well dress up a little brown hen.|$|E
6000|$|PETKOFF (appeasing her).--but not {{friendly}} relations: remember that. They {{wanted to}} put that in; but I insisted on its being struck out. <b>What</b> more <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aye!" [...] cried Myles, desperately; [...] "but <b>what</b> else <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> An <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not say the words, thou callest me coward, and coward I am not." ...|$|R
6000|$|So he fell {{to hunting}} in his pockets--pocket after pocket, and he had plenty of them--muttering all the while, [...] "Now, <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> have <b>done</b> with them?" ...|$|R
60|$|My {{heart was}} sick with dread. Yet <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> I said nothing; only I covered {{my face with}} my hands and wept.|$|E
6000|$|<b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> Here was a {{stranger}} utterly and helplessly at my mercy--and that stranger a forlorn woman. No house was near; no one was passing whom I could consult; and no earthly right existed on my part {{to give me a}} power of control over her, even if I had known how to exercise it. I trace these lines, self-distrustfully, with the shadows of after-events darkening the very paper I write on; and still I say, <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Dunham, miserably; [...] "he got me aside, {{and asked}} me for it. <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> What {{would you have done}} yourself?" ...|$|E
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 3: <b>What</b> job <b>could</b> <b>I</b> be <b>doing</b> for Internships? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, has he not? <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> have <b>done?</b> <b>What</b> ought <b>I</b> to have <b>done?</b> Tell me, Mr. Harcourt. It distresses me beyond {{measure that}} you should think I have been to blame." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I tell thee, good woman, I saw him go {{down before}} {{three of their}} pikes. <b>What</b> more <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> but drive my horse over the nearest rogue who was rifling him?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{felt very}} ignorant, but <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> I was so entirely unacquainted {{with the subject}} that I {{understood}} nothing about it even then.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{was not an}} {{agreeable}} {{train of}} thought to follow. <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> I was answered by the impulse which commands me to paint.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me! <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{over there}} in the mud with the queer green frogs?" [...] laughed Kitty, as this song was croaked at her.|$|E
6000|$|I saw {{her eyes}} flash with indignation, {{and this time}} it was I who dropped mine, while I felt my face {{flushing}} under her gaze. It was cowardly, but <b>what</b> else <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You are his minister, dear Glastonbury, and {{a worthy}} one. I know {{not what we}} should have done without you in this awful trial; but, indeed, <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> have <b>done</b> {{throughout}} life without you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>What</b> better <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> [...] So far {{were the}} Allies from {{sheering}} off [...] As he supposed, {{that they had}} moved in march [...] Full fanfare hither! I was duty-bound [...] To let him know.|$|R
6000|$|... "No;--nor mine. When I {{was told}} that I was doing no good about the house, and {{reminded}} that I was penniless, <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> but go away?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dora {{is coming}} to stay with me. She is coming home with me the day after tomorrow. If {{you would like to}} call, I am sure papa would be happy to see you.' <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> but invoke a silent blessing on Miss Mills's head, and store Miss Mills's address in the securest corner of my memory! <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> but tell Miss Mills, with {{grateful}} looks and fervent words, how much I appreciated her good offices, and what an inestimable value I set upon her friendship! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All I had was Richard's," [...] Ada said; [...] "and Richard {{would not}} take it, Esther, and <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> but be his wife when I loved him dearly!" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "And now, O {{inhabitants}} of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt {{me and my}} vineyard. <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> have <b>done</b> more to my vineyard, that <b>I</b> have not <b>done</b> in it?" [...] Isaiah 5:3-4 ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I suppose so," [...] {{answered}} King Rinkitink, with a laugh. [...] "But <b>what</b> else <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> My subjects {{would not}} allow me to go anywhere at all, if they knew it. So I just ran away." ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{question}} {{forced a}} laugh from my lips. Quarrel with Louis, indeed! <b>What</b> more <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> in that direction? Then I frowned, in temporary annoyance. I hated {{to hear her}} speak {{of him as a}} person to be considered.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not very much, perhaps," [...] said Miss Salome mildly. [...] "But <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> You wouldn't have me {{turn the}} child adrift {{on the world}} again, would you, Clemantiny?" ...|$|E
60|$|BURGE [sitting {{down again}} with a shrug] Oh, I had to be told. But <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> If we had refused we might {{have had to go}} out of office.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am above {{having such}} people here, Stephen; but <b>what</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> <b>do?</b> And {{your father is}} so rough in his nature that he's more mixed up with them than need be.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>did</b> so, {{making my}} own {{likeness}} quite a pleasant {{relief to the}} ugliness of my brother-in-law's. It was my intention to send both portraits to the Royal Academy Exhibition, to get custom, and show the public generally <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> knew the institution with which I had to deal, and called my own likeness, Portrait of a Nobleman.|$|R
6000|$|... "What nonsense! <b>What</b> <b>could</b> <b>I</b> have <b>done</b> by myself? You {{know very}} well that you earned all the money that started us here. You paid the wages of Gow Yum and Chan Chi, and old Hughie, and Mrs. Paul, and--why, you've done it all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said June shrewdly, [...] "I {{could buy}} for ten {{thousand}}; {{that would only}} be four hundred a year. But I should {{have to pay a}} thousand a year rent, and that would only leave me five hundred. If I had the Gallery, Dad, think <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make Eric Cobbley's name in no time, and ever so many others." ...|$|R
