Responding to this paucity of research, this paper addresses Bolivian migrants’ inclusions in and exclusions from economic citizenship in Chile. Conceptually, the paper {{calls for a}} holistic and spatially aware approach to comprehending migration and citizenship, proposing the overarching conceptual framework of interacting transnational social spaces of citizenship representing its legal, political, social, and economic dimensions. It then focuses particularly on the transnational social space of economic citizenship, using this conceptual approach {{as a means to}} bring into better dialogue research on the migrant division of labour, precarious employment, lab our exploitation, financial exclusion, and migrant citizenship practices. The analytical potential of the conceptual framework is explored through examining the specific geographies of the Bolivian-Chilean space of economic citizenship to reveal the reality of what is increasingly being referred to as the ‘Chilean dream’. Drawing on nine months of multi-sited ethnography and 76 semi-structured interviews, the paper addresses migrants’ economic situation in Bolivia before examining their changes in circumstances following migration to Chile, looking particular at the migrant labour niches <b>of</b> <b>wholesale</b> <b>clothing</b> retail, agriculture, and domestic labour. It explores the structural factors leading to economic marginalisation in Bolivia and labour exploitation in Chile.

40|$|Graduation date: 1983 Perception {{between people}} {{is part of}} the process of nonverbal communication. Person {{perception}} including body, facial expression, facial features, and <b>clothing</b> is part <b>of</b> the process that results in the formation of impressions of persons by each other. The purpose of this study was to investigate clothing perception and develop methods of evaluating what is noticed about clothing in simulated first encounter situations. This study investigated relationships between number and type <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> clues, degree <b>of</b> liking for <b>clothing</b> viewed, and similarity <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> <b>of</b> stimulus to subject (st/su). Data were collected in the form of written responses by 255 (116 male and 139 female) subjects responding to fourteen stimulus slides of men's and women's clothing. Responses were analyzed for each clothing slide to determine the number <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> clues and types <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> clues mentioned. Clothing clue words were categorized into three categories: descriptive (D), inferred (I), and evaluative (E). Two systems of coding the categories were developed: dominant and composite. Relationships between the four variables, number of clues, types of clues, degree <b>of</b> liking for <b>clothing</b> viewed, and similarity <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> <b>of</b> stimulus/subject, were examined using tests of mean, median, chi-square, and the Spearman Correlation Coefficient. Of the six null hypothesis, one was rejected, four were partially rejected, and one failed to be rejected. There was no significant relationship between types <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> clues mentioned and the degree of liking for the clothing viewed. There was a partial relationship between the number <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> clues and the similarity <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> <b>of</b> stimulus/subject. Female subjects tended to give a greater number <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> clues than male subjects when they were viewing similar (female) clothing slides, and also greater numbers <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> clues when viewing dissimilar (male) clothing slides. There was a partial relationship between number <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> clues and degree <b>of</b> liking for <b>clothing</b> viewed. Nine <b>of</b> the fourteen <b>clothing</b> slides had no significant relationship between these variables. There was a partial relationship between the types <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> clues given and the similarity <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> <b>of</b> stimulus/subject. Using the dominant coding system there was no relationship between these variables. Using the composite coding system there was no significant relationship for ten <b>of</b> the fourteen <b>clothing</b> slides. There was a partial relationship between the degree <b>of</b> liking for <b>clothing</b> viewed and the similarity <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> <b>of</b> stimulus/ subject. Although there were some significant differences between same sex and different sex in the degree of liking, examination of the data shows that there is not consistency in same sex (similar) scoring higher or lower than opposite sex (different) on degree <b>of</b> liking for <b>clothing</b> slide viewed. There was a significant relationship between number <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> clues mentioned and type <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> clue. Subjects using only descriptive words gave a significantly greater number of words. Subjects using only evaluative words gave significantly fewer words. Fewer subjects used words in the inferred category. In summary, female subjects viewing female clothing slides tended to give significantly different scores when noting the number of clues and the degree of liking for a clothing slide. Male subjects viewing male clothing slides gave fewer numbers <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> clues than did female subjects. Male and female subjects did not give significantly different types <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> clues when responding to either male or female clothing slides. This study shows that it is possible and useful to evaluate clothing perception to determine the number and types <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> clues. The variables related to similarity and liking could be modified to achieve more determinant results. Additional studies can be undertaken to refine the methods and to investigate other variables related to clothing perception...|$|R

30|$|The basic {{composition}} <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> includes material, structure, form, and function. Material is {{the framework}} <b>of</b> a <b>clothing</b> system; specifically, it effects {{change in the}} structure and form <b>of</b> <b>clothing.</b> Certain materials can even be interacting with consumer senses directly and become a form of the product. Structure refers to the result of interconnection and mutually interaction between elements in the system, or the method of connection between diverse materials.

Finally, the function <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> refers not only to an article’s usage function, but also to the value of interaction between individuals and clothing in social relationships (Verganti 2013). Thus, the composition <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> can be divided into two levels: the formal and technical level, and the cultural connotation level. In design, cultural connotation is a basic element <b>of</b> <b>clothing,</b> whereas form and technique are elements that help convey cultural connotations (Cao 2011).|$|R

Specifically, this study investigated the <b>clothing</b> perceptions <b>of</b> fine-, nine-, and thirteen-year-olds. Possible relationships between characteristics of the perceiver [...] age, sex, and level of cognitive development [...] and two perceptual dimensions [...] number and type <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> clues mentioned [...] were examined. The sample was composed of 90 subjects: 30 five-year-olds, 30 nine-year-olds, and 30 thirteen-year-olds. Each age group included 15 boys and 15 girls. The instrument employed to measure clothing perception was adapted from Shields' (1983) instrument. Subjects were shown three color photographs (clothing stimuli). Data were gathered in the form of "free descriptions": subjects described freely the clothing stimulus they were viewing. The number <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> clues was determined by counting the total number <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> responses given by the subjects for each clothing photograph. The type <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> clues was then determined by coding the clothing clues into one of two categories: 1) a "concrete" category or 2) an "abstract" category. The concrete category included clothing responses that were descriptive in nature; the abstract category included clothing responses that were evaluative and inferred in nature. Age was significantly related to the perceptual measures. Nine- and thirteen-year-old subjects furnished a greater number <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> clues than did five-year-old subjects.
