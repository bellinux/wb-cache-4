5|$|Hood {{was laid}} down at Chatham Dockyard on 12 August 1889 and was {{launched}} on 30 July 1891, the Viscountess Hood christening her. She finished her sea trials in May 1893 and was commissioned on 1 June 1893 {{at the cost}} of £926,396.

5|$|In late 1857, Bologna's inquisitor Father Pier Feletti {{heard that}} Anna Morisi, {{who had worked}} in the Mortara house for six years, had {{secretly}} baptised Edgardo <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> thought he was about to die as a baby. The Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition held that this made the child irrevocably a Catholic and, because the Papal States forbade the raising of Christians by members of other faiths, ordered that he be taken from his family and brought up by the Church. Police came to the Mortara home late on 23 June 1858 and removed Edgardo the following evening.|$|E

At the age of 13, Lorde started writing songs herself. MacLachlan unsuccessfully tried to set up Lorde with several songwriters and producers to help her with production. Ultimately, he paired Lorde with Joel Little in December 2011, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> just turned 15. Little was impressed by Lorde's vocal performance and songwriting abilities, and he built songs with musical structures based on Lorde's lyrics.|$|E
5|$|Production of the {{new version}} of the opening episode took place in what was to have been a three-week break for the cast between {{production}} blocks. Gina McKee was initially very concerned about having her character's early life story changed <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> already based elements of her later performance on the previously-established version. Eccleston was also unhappy about the sudden changes. However, McKee felt that the new version of episode one eventually made for a much stronger opening to the story.|$|E

5|$|Hoshino {{was born}} on April 21, 1980, in Shiga Prefecture, Japan, as the younger of fraternal twin girls and the second of three children. As a child, she {{originally}} dreamed of becoming an astronaut. Hoshino confessed she was not too interested in school, often making excuses to avoid taking classes. Additionally, she added that would often practise drawing {{in the middle of}} the classes which gave her doubts <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> to erase them. She drew her first manga at twenty-one. In 1998, Hoshino moved to Tokyo. She dreamed of bringing her mother to the city and was able to in 2006.

5|$|In early {{drafts of}} Final Fantasy VII, Tifa {{was to be}} a {{background}} character. Her role in AVALANCHE was to add support behind the scenes, and to cheer everyone up after missions, as well as having a particular fondness for Cloud. She was also supposed to have a large scar on her back caused by Cloud, and partial amnesia from the incident <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> received it. A scene intended to imply herself and Cloud having sex was proposed by Masato Kato, one of the event planners, but it was replaced with a toned down version by Kitase in which a risqué line is followed by a fade to black. In an interview Nojima stated that none of the staff thought the scene would become such an issue at the time.|$|E

Morgan remembered the reaction of one male colleague when she told him the news; he said if she had five children like he did, she would have hardly noticed the new baby. Morgan's mother moved in with her and cared for the baby so that Morgan could work uninterrupted.|$|E

All her other works were produced with a rapidity, that did not give her powers time fully to expand. But this was written slowly and with mature consideration. She began it in several forms, which she successively rejected, after they were considerably advanced. She wrote {{many parts of the}} work again and again, and, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> finished what she intended for the first part, she felt herself more urgently stimulated to revise and improve what she had written, than to proceed, with constancy of application, in the parts that were to follow.|$|E

One man reportedly spotted the problem and shouted to her not to light the fuses, but his cries were drowned out by the cheering of the crowd. Later reports suggested she had left the gas valve open, allowing sparks to ignite the gas and set fire to the balloon, or that her balloon was of poor construction and allowed gas to escape throughout the ascent.|$|E
