5|$|The {{overwhelming}} sensation {{about the}} neighborhood <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> the community caused {{not just by}} the packing plants located immediately to the east, {{but also by the}} 345-acre Chicago Union Stock Yards containing 2,300 pens of livestock, located further east from the packing plants.|$|E
500|$|There {{were some}} improvised scenes. These {{included}} {{a scene in}} the beginning of the episode where Alan and Joanna are in a middle of a field and the scene begins with a low-angle shot. Later, when Alan is [...] "humping" [...] Joanna, the scene suddenly becomes a crane shot. This is because the crew at the time had a crane camera after they had finished filming the final scenes in series 2 where Alan, Joanna and Martin are teetering over the edge of a cliff in the stolen camper van. The camper van scenes were the hardest to shoot, especially the scene where the van explodes, as this had to be done in one take. Another problem <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> the van, which Pippa Haywood said, [...] "smelt of old dogs." [...] The van also suffered other problems such as bits of the steering wheel and gear stick coming off. Julian Rhind-Tutt commented that the scene where Alan and Boyce talk together for the last time was one of the most moving scenes in the whole of Green Wing. The wedding was shot at Hall of Bayham Abbey in Kent, where the crew had difficulty filming due to bad weather. The show also features a guest appearance from Jeremy Sheffield near the end of the episode as Sue's new boyfriend.|$|E
60|$|I thought I was in Pegu, so strangely woody <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> the dark-colored timbers, whose odor was {{heightened}} by the rigging of kayar, or cocoa-nut fiber.|$|E
50|$|Characteristic <b>of</b> Kroustas <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> Raki {{distillery}} in October, the dry but cool summers, the dry {{and rocky}} landscape {{and the old}} ladies with the black scarfs and the wrinkled faces. What could you buy from Kroustas? Pure food like honey, almonds, walnuts, myzithra (soft sour cheese) and raki (locally distilled spirit).|$|R
30|$|As <b>is</b> evident, <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> {{historic}} books <b>is</b> {{a complex}} mixture of compounds. However, {{in order to}} interpret the chemical information, we need to explore the appropriate terminology and method to describe it.|$|R
2500|$|Reading Isaac's {{observation}} in [...] "See, <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> my son <b>is</b> as <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> {{a field that}} the Lord has blessed," [...] Rav Judah the son of Rav Samuel bar Shilat said {{in the name of}} Rav that Jacob smelled like an apple orchard.|$|R
60|$|And while Daughtry waited, perplexed, confused, {{wondering}} why Doctor Emory did not proceed, the coal of fire burned {{his skin and}} flesh, till the smoke of it was apparent to all, as <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> it. With a sharp laugh of triumph, Doctor Emory stepped back.|$|E

"I tell ye, sargeant dear," [...] said Betty, {{removing}} the mug from her mouth, [...] "'tis no r'asonable {{to think it}} was more than the piddler himself; sure now, where <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> sulphur, and the wings, and the tail, and the cloven foot? Besides, sargeant, it's no dacent to tell a lone famale that she had Beelzeboob for a bedfellow." ...|$|E
6000|$|Our skipper {{accepted}} the invitation, went below, {{and was soon}} busy commenting on the weed, which, as the Dutchman truly pointed out, was [...] "so sheep as well as goot." [...] But another smell in that cabin overpowered that of the tobacco. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> Hollands, {{or some sort of}} spirit, which soon aroused the craving that had gained such power over the fisherman.|$|E
25|$|A 1995 {{study at}} the University of Bern showed that women appear to <b>be</b> {{attracted}} to <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> men who have different MHC profiles from their own, and that oral contraceptives reversed this effect.|$|R
50|$|Doña Ramona Pompa y Pompa (Édgar Vivar): Botija's mother. She was {{presented}} as a somewhat snobbish woman. Both she and El Botija <b>are</b> allergic to <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> gardenias, and {{have been known to}} pass out.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} {{theories}} has <b>been</b> advanced for <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> unusual <b>smells.</b> They {{could possibly have}} resulted from the burning or smouldering (but not detonation) of the bombs' explosives, or they could have <b>been</b> <b>the</b> natural <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> explosive. The homemade explosive thought to have <b>been</b> used in <b>the</b> 7 July bombings, TATP, is notoriously unstable and emits a distinctive smell as it sublimates.|$|R
60|$|A soft patter of {{rain on the}} {{tarpaulin}} warned Helen {{to remember}} Dale's directions, and, pulling up the heavy covering, she arranged it hoodlike over the saddle. Then, with Bo close and warm beside her, she closed her eyes, {{and the sense of}} the black forest and the wind and rain faded. Last of all sensations <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> smoke that blew under the tarpaulin.|$|E
60|$|The air {{was soft}} and grey and mild and evening was coming. There <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> evening in the air, {{the smell of the}} fields in the country where they digged up turnips to peel them and eat them when they went out for a walk to Major Barton's, the smell there was in the little wood beyond the {{pavilion}} where the gallnuts were.|$|E
60|$|When Whopper got outside again, {{followed}} by Shep, {{he saw the}} wolves had approached still closer. There were now seven of them, and they stood in a semi-circle, sniffing the air suspiciously. The man-smell was strong, and this they did not like, for to them it betokened only danger. Yet mingled with the man-smell <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> chicken and rabbit meat, and this pleased them, for they were hungry.|$|E
50|$|All {{the adventures}} of <b>the</b> boys <b>are</b> {{accompanied}} by <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> croissants and <b>the</b> presence, not always welcome, of former teachers such as Professor Martinelli, horrible math teacher, who sometimes goes there to bring a bit of fear between her students.|$|R
50|$|Fisneset (Fart Headland) is a {{headland}} in Sørkapp Land at Spitsbergen, Svalbard. It <b>is</b> {{located at}} <b>the</b> southwestern shore of Spitsbergen, {{northwest of the}} bay Stormbukta, between Olsokflya and Bjørnbeinflya. <b>The</b> headland <b>is</b> named from <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> hydrogen sulfide emerging from springs at the site.|$|R
50|$|Armed with secret cameras, BBC reporters sneaked into <b>the</b> camp to <b>be</b> {{met with}} <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> raw sewage. Sewage had leaked {{out all over}} the camp, and workers had to create a network of {{stepping}} stones to cross it and get back to their accommodation blocks.|$|R
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> carrion, of putrifying flesh, and of {{that old}} and ever-newly {{moistened}} crust of dust and coagulated blood. It was, or seemed, a curiously substantial and stationary smell; travellers approaching or leaving the capital by the great south road, which skirted the killing-grounds, would hold their noses and ride {{a mile or so}} at a furious gallop until they got out of the abominable stench.|$|E
60|$|Whether it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> {{the cheese}} or the ketchup we know not, but here better {{thoughts}} came over our hero. Insignificant causes often produce tremendous effects. The touching of a trigger {{is but a}} small matter; the effects of such a touch are sometimes deadly as well as touching. Possibly the sugar, if not the cinnamon, {{may have been an}} element in his change of mind. At all events {{it is safe to say}} that the general smell of groceries was associated with it.|$|E
60|$|A tree, {{contracting}} in {{the cool}} of the night, made a loud noise. It was directly above him. He yelped in his fright. A panic seized him, and he ran madly toward the village. He knew an overpowering desire for the protection and companionship of man. In his nostrils <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> the camp-smoke. In his ears the camp-sounds and cries were ringing loud. He passed out of the forest and into the moonlit open where were no shadows nor darknesses. But no village greeted his eyes. He had forgotten. The village had gone away.|$|E
40|$|The {{small tree}} Melientha suavis Pierre subsp. suavis (Opiliaceae) <b>is</b> in <b>the</b> Philippines so far known from two localities in Mindanao, only (Misamis Or., Claveria; Cotabato, Port Lebak: Hiepko, 1979, 1984). During {{vegetation}} studies on Mt Pangasugan, Leyte, Eastern Visayas (Langenberger, 2000), {{it was found}} scattered along ridges between 250 and 530 m altitude. The trees reached a height of about 8 m. <b>The</b> bark <b>is</b> greyish brown with fissures exposing the white inner bark. Fruits developed in February and became creamish yellow when ripe, very sweet and tasteful, but could be observed rotting on the trees. The high hunting pressure {{has led to a}} near extermination of local bird and primate populations (local farmers: pers. comm.). Twigs are hard to cut with pruning shears probably due to the high wood density. The fact that <b>the</b> timber <b>is</b> used for charcoal in Thailand supports this assumption. The occurrence of calcium carbonate cystoliths may be an additional reason. Another remarkable feature <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> broken twigs – it is very similar to that of European elder (Sambucus nigra L., Caprifoliaceae) ...|$|R
25|$|Florrie O'Donoghue, {{intelligence}} {{officer of the}} 1st Cork Brigade IRA at the time, described the scene in Cork {{on the morning of}} the 12th:Many familiar landmarks were gone forever– where whole buildings had collapsed here and there a solitary wall leaned at some crazy angle from its foundation. The streets ran with sooty water, <b>the</b> footpaths <b>were</b> strewn with broken glass and debris, ruins smoked and smoldered and over everything <b>was</b> <b>the</b> all-pervasive <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> burning.|$|R
2500|$|He {{knew this}} experience, {{but could not}} change the {{smallest}} part of it. No ancestral presences would remain in her consciousness, but she would carry with her forever afterward the clear sights and sounds and <b>smells.</b> <b>The</b> seeking machines would <b>be</b> there, <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> blood and entrails, the cowering humans in their burrows aware only {{that they could not}} escape [...] [...] [...] while all the time the mechanical movement approached, nearer and nearer and nearer ...louder...louder! Everywhere she searched, it would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same. No escape anywhere.|$|R
60|$|My courage failed that evening. I {{spent it}} at the {{coastguard}} station, where they gave me bread and cheese and some awful cider. I passed the kitchen as I came back. A fire was still burning there, and two figures, misty in the darkness, flitted about with stealthy laughter like spirits afraid of being detected in a carnal-meal. They were Pasiance and Mrs. Hopgood; and so charming <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> eggs and bacon, and they had such an air of tender enjoyment of this dark revel, that I stifled many pangs, as I crept hungry up to bed.|$|E
6000|$|Yusuf's {{little room}} was very hot. The dust had blown in, {{and the floor}} was gritty. Flies hovered about the copper lamp which burned an {{aromatic}} oil. The agent gave Kit coffee and a cigarette. The tobacco was bitter but soothing and Kit imagined it was mixed with an Eastern drug. At Yusuf's he generally felt dull; perhaps it <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> the lamp, leather and spices. They began to talk, and presently Kit remarked: [...] "If you send your boats to-morrow, we will hoist out {{the last of the}} cargo. Have you got much stuff for us?" ...|$|E
60|$|What first struck Margaret in Thrums <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> the caddis. The town {{smells of}} caddis no longer, but whiffs {{of it may}} be got even now as one passes the houses of the old, where the lay still swings at little windows like a great ghost pendulum. To me it is a homely smell, which I draw in with a great breath, {{but it was as}} strange to Margaret as the weavers themselves, who, in their colored nightcaps and corduroys {{streaked}} with threads, gazed at her and Gavin. The little minister was trying to look severe and old, but twenty-one was in his eye.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> crop can <b>be</b> {{attacked}} by larvae of the carrot fly (Chamaepsila rosae). This pest feeds {{on the outer}} layers of the root, burrowing its way inside later in the season. Seedlings may be killed while larger roots <b>are</b> spoiled. <b>The</b> damage done provides a point of entry for fungal rots and canker. <b>The</b> fly <b>is</b> attracted by <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> bruised tissue.|$|R
50|$|His {{excellent}} poetic qualities can <b>be</b> seen in <b>the</b> following lines:The jungles on {{all sides}} <b>are</b> thick with <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> Bakul flower;the Ketaki flower has filled the wind and made it dense.In every home <b>the</b> she-peacock <b>is</b> dancing;Everybody's eyes feast upon the dark clouds (meaning also Lord Krishna),but it is in my home alone where the flame of love remains unquenched.|$|R
50|$|Greenland sharks {{have also}} been found with remains of seals, polar bears, horses, moose, and {{reindeer}} (in one case an entire reindeer body) in their stomachs. <b>The</b> Greenland shark <b>is</b> {{known to be a}} scavenger, and <b>is</b> attracted by <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> rotting meat in the water. The sharks have frequently been observed gathering around fishing boats. It also scavenges on seals.|$|R
6000|$|... "My Daughter," [...] {{answered}} {{the old man}} in a sweet, grave voice, [...] "I come from the wilderness which is my home. Long have I outlived all those of my generation, yes, and their children also. Therefore the wilderness and the forest that do not change are now my only friends, since they alone knew me when I was young. Be pitiful now to me, for I am poor, so poor that for three whole days no food has passed my lips. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> the meat which you have with you that led me to you. Give me of that meat, Daughter, for I starve." ...|$|E

60|$|When {{she reached}} the wagon Alison found it covered by a heavy {{waterproof}} sheet which was stretched across a pole. Loose hay had been strewn between a row of wooden cases and {{one side of the}} vehicle and the space beneath the sheeted roof was filled with a faint aromatic odor, which she afterward learned <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> the wild peppermint that grows in the prairie grass. When she had spread one blanket on the hay the couch felt seductively soft, and she sank into it contentedly. Tired as she was, however, she did not go to sleep immediately, for it was the first night she had ever spent in the open, and for a time the strangeness of her surroundings reacted on her.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, nearly 20,000 people {{attended}} the third annual Hempstalk Festival at Sellwood Riverfront Park in Portland, Oregon. While organizers insisted smoking would not <b>be</b> tolerated, <b>the</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> marijuana {{lingered in the}} air and some festival goers chose to consume various forms of cannabis foods. No festival attendees were arrested. Seattle Hempfest is an annual event in Seattle, Washington also attended by Oregonians, known as the world's largest annual gathering advocating decriminalization of marijuana for uses including but not limited to medicinal, industrial, and recreational. The 2008 Seattle Hempfest, which took place August 1617, set a new record with around 150,000 people in attendance.|$|R
40|$|Blood glucose and insulin {{levels were}} {{measured}} in undisturbed and free-moving rats. The insulin level rises {{already in the}} 1 st min {{after the start of}} food ingestion, whereas the glucose level begins to increase only in the 3 rd min if carbohydrate-rich food is eaten. This early rise in insulin level is observed also under conditions in which either carbohydrate-free food or even “food” without any caloric value <b>is</b> offered. <b>The</b> <b>smell</b> <b>of</b> food cannot produce this early insulin response. It is concluded that in the rat other factors besides a rise in nutrient content in the blood produce insulin release in the first minutes after food ingestion. ...|$|R
