50|$|The {{remaining}} player now {{plays to}} win the contents of their Personal Bank; all other cash values are blanked. To win the prize, the contestant has to stop a ball on The Edge. Before they roll, they face a final quiz round, 75 seconds of questions (each requiring four correct answers in Series 1). For each question correctly answered, the Edge is enlarged by the equivalent of two cash zones. Once on the red lane, the player can choose to roll once for the full bank amount, twice for half the amount or three times for one-third the amount; they choose how many rolls they want to wager ahead of rolling, and are not reimbursed if they succeed in fewer rolls than nominated. If all their rolls fail to stop in the <b>winning</b> <b>area</b> - either by coming up short or by going over the Edge - the player wins nothing. The maximum a player can win is £14,000 (£14,500 in Series 2); in order for that to happen, the player must roll all six balls exactly on the Edge {{in the first three}} rounds (£1,000 + £2,000 + £2,000 + £3,000 + £3,000 + £3,000 = £14,000 in Series 1, £1,500 + £2,000 + £2,000 + £3,000 + £3,000 + £3,000 = £14,500 in Series 2) and choose to roll only one ball in the final round and land it in the <b>winning</b> <b>area.</b>|$|R
