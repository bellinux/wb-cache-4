25|$|Although the {{fighting}} was indecisive, the battle had halted the Jacobite's momentum. For the next four years, the Scots Greys continued to suppress Jacobite supporters in Scotland.

The next 23 years passed relatively uneventfully for the regiment.|$|E

25|$|The Tullahassee Mission {{continued}} to grow and do a job in educating {{the children of the}} Creek Nation until July 10, 1861, when it was suddenly closed due to the outbreak of the Civil War. All of the mission property, (which amounted to $12,270 in 1861), was taken possession by the chiefs of the nation. The same thing happenend with the Koweta Mission. The Creek children were sent back to their homes, while the dedicated teachers took a mournful leave of each other and <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> homes in the Northern and Southern parts of the country.|$|E
25|$|By late July 1941 the {{operations}} that Layforce had undertaken had severely reduced its strength {{and under the}} circumstances reinforcements were unlikely. The operational difficulties that had been exposed during the Bardia raid, the changing strategic imperatives {{of the situation in}} the Middle East, and the failure of the high command to fully embrace the commando concept had largely served to make the force ineffective. As a result, {{the decision was made to}} disband Layforce. Many of the men <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> previous regiments following the decision, while others chose to remain in the Middle East and subsequently joined other special forces units that were raised later.|$|E
25|$|Interurban {{business}} increased for {{the survivors}} during World War II due to fuel oil rationing cutting car use and large wartime employment. When {{the war ended}} in 1945, riders quickly <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> automobiles, so most of these lines finally abandoned. Several systems managed to struggle into the 1950s, including the Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad (passenger service ended 1950), Lehigh Valley Transit Company (1951), West Penn Railways (1952), and the Illinois Terminal Railroad (1958). The West Penn was the largest interurban {{to operate in the}} east at 339 miles and had provided the very hilly Pittsburgh area coal country towns with hourly transportation since 1888.|$|E

25|$|The Depression also {{resulted}} in an increase of emigration of people {{for the first time}} in American history. For example, some immigrants <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> native countries, and some native US citizens went to Canada, Australia, and South Africa. It also {{resulted in}} the mass migration of people from badly hit areas in the Great Plains and the South to places such as California and the North, respectively (see Okies and the Great Migration of African Americans). Racial tensions also increased during this time. By the 1940s immigration had returned to normal, and emigration declined. A well-known example of an emigrant was Frank McCourt, who went to Ireland, as recounted in his book Angela's Ashes.|$|E
25|$|As of UEFA Euro 2016 {{qualifying}} round, Azerbaijan's home colours are all-red kit. The team {{wears an}} all-blue kit for away games. This combination of colours are traditional {{for the national}} team since their first game. In the beginning of 90s the team has worn a white shirt, {{to the end of}} decade it has been transformated into blue-white striped shirts. At the beginning of the 2000s, the kit was replaced by the white shirt with a vertical tricolour stripe, color originating from the national flag of Azerbaijan on the chest. The kit was changed into blue shirts, red shorts and green socks only for the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying round. After the tournament, the national team <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> usual combination of colours.|$|E
25|$|Green posted six Top 10's in the 2002 season, {{including}} a career best second at Loudon in July, and finished seventeenth in points. Although the team started 2003 with a Daytona 500 pole, Green {{and the team}} failed to jell as Childress had hoped and on May 5, was fired following the first race at Richmond. In {{what amounted to a}} trade between organizations, Green was replaced by the former driver of the No. 1 car for Dale Earnhardt, Inc., Steve Park, with Green taking Park's ride at DEI. Green's firing was largely connected to an altercation between him and teammate Kevin Harvick during the Richmond race in which Harvick wrecked Green while racing for a top 10 position, igniting an already tumultuous relationship between the two drivers that <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> competition in the Busch Series. Park would score a pole at Daytona in July and earn two Top 10s but had only six finishes inside the Top 20, ending the season 32nd in points.|$|E

25|$|By {{capturing}} and executing Wang Zhi, the Ming {{court had}} hoped to perform a decapitation strike in which his followers would disband. In fact, as pacification-minded officials had feared, Wang Zhi's followers gave up hope for peaceful trade and <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> violent ways. Feeling betrayed after Wang Zhi was apprehended, Mao Haifeng made Zhoushan Island his base and launched raids on Zhejiang and Fujian. Hu Zongxian made {{a concerted effort to}} dislodge Mao from Zhoushan in March 1558, converging on the island from six directions with the generals Yu Dayou and Qi Jiguang, but failed and was forced to retreat. He tempered the rising criticism against him by blaming Yu and Qi, while sending Beijing a white deer, an auspicious Taoist symbol, to the emperor's great delight. The pirates eventually abandoned Zhoushan in December of the same year owing to the heavy military presence there, and scattered south to Fujian which became their new area of operation. In the summer of 1559, the remaining pirate bands in the Yangtze River Delta were wiped out.|$|E
25|$|After {{the first}} days battle the Persians had either inflicted massive {{casualties}} on Astyages' personal guard that {{was made up of}} cavalry, or the rest of his army that was also cavalry. Nevertheless, the Persians still claimed victory the first day. The second day of the battle Cyrus, assuming the battle had ended, secretly retired south {{with the rest of the}} armed forces, while only Cambyses and a few old men remained in the city. When Cyrus was forced to fight again, Astyages' ingenious move of cavalry occurred, which was aimed at capturing the poorly guarded city. As he was assuming the battle had not ended, he easily captured the city, while only Cambyses is reported to have been wounded and later died. It is debated among today's historians if the second day is to be counted as part of the original battle, or that it should be counted as a separate battle. As the Persians retired south, Astyages readily abandoned the city, which is based partly on the scant sources from Nicolaus, therefore not becoming a complete victory for Astyages, as he is not known to put a garrison there after he and his forces went south after the Persians. It was however a psychological blow to the Medes as they thought the Persians were lucky in the first battle, but again the Persians won, this time tactically. Both armies later <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> camps and organized their armies while deciding where to meet for the next fight. Then as the year passed, both forces agreed to meet at the Persian capital which Astyages wished to capture.|$|E
500|$|Another {{effect of}} the battle was the changed {{attitude}} of the Swiss. [...] Francesco Guicciardini wrote of the aftermath of Bicocca: They <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> mountains diminished in numbers, but much more diminished in audacity; for {{it is certain that}} the losses which they suffered at Bicocca so affected them that in the coming years they no longer displayed their wonted vigour. [...] While Swiss mercenaries would continue {{to take part in the}} Italian Wars, they no longer possessed the willingness to make headlong attacks that they had at Novara in 1513 or Marignano in 1515; their performance at the Battle of Pavia in 1525 would surprise observers by its lack of initiative.|$|E

500|$|During {{the heavy}} fighting, {{portions}} of three Japanese companies, including two from Tamura's {{and one from}} Watanabe's battalions, skirted the Marine defenses on the ridge, while suffering heavy losses from Marine gunfire, and reached the edge of [...] "Fighter One", a secondary runway of Henderson Field. A counterattack by the Marine engineers stopped one Japanese company's advances and forced it to retreat. The other two companies waited {{at the edge of}} the jungle for reinforcements to arrive before attacking into the open area around the airfield. [...] When no reinforcements joined them, both companies <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> original positions south of the ridge after daybreak. Most of the rest of Watanabe's battalion did not participate in the battle because they lost contact with their commander during the night.|$|E
500|$|Before the 12th annual Gathering of the Juggalos, Insane Clown Posse were {{contacted}} by Jack White, who invited Bruce and Utsler to his mansion {{because he wanted}} to collaborate with them. White played the track he was working on, an arrangement of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's [...] "Leck mich im Arsch" [...] with live instrumentation by JEFF the Brotherhood, for Bruce and Utsler and explained that the title of the track translated to [...] "Lick My Ass". Bruce perceived that the scatological nature of the composition was the reason why White asked Bruce and Utsler to appear on the song, but once White explained Mozart's sense of humor, they became excited to work with White, <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>their</b> hotel room to write their lyrics, and returned to record with White and JEFF the Brotherhood in White's home recording studio. Bruce and Utsler's vocals were recorded in one take. The song was released as a single on September 13 by White's label Third Man Records, paired with another song, [...] "Mountain Girl", which Bruce describes as his favorite of the two songs recorded with White, and [...] "more ICP's feel".|$|E
