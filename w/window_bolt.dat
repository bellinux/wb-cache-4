It is situated in the Cusco Region, Canchis Province, Pitumarca District and in the Quispicanchi Province, Marcapata District. Japu Punta lies north of the lake Sibinacocha and northwest of Condoriquiña, Huila Aje and Yayamari.|$|E

500|$|In September 1930 Heseltine {{moved with}} Barbara Peache into a {{basement}} flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, {{he worked in}} the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of [...] "Bethlehem Down" [...] with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and <b>windows</b> <b>bolted,</b> and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.|$|R

40|$|The thin {{windows for}} the Muon Ionization Cooling Experiment (MICE) liquid Absorber will be {{fabricated}} from 6061 -T 6 -aluminum. The absorber and vacuum vessel thin windows are 300 -mm {{in diameter and}} are 180 mm thick at the center. The windows are designed for an internal burst pressure of 0. 68 MPa (100 psig) when warm. The MICE experiment design calls for changeable windows on the absorber, so a <b>bolted</b> <b>window</b> design was adopted. Welded windows offer some potential advantages over <b>bolted</b> <b>windows</b> when {{they are on the}} absorber itself. This report describes the <b>bolted</b> <b>window</b> and its seal. This report also describes an alternate window that is welded directly to the absorber body. The welded window design presented permits the weld to be ground off and re-welded. This report presents a thermal FEA analysis of the window seal-weld, while the window is being welded. Finally, the results of a test of a welded-window are presented...|$|R

The cavity is to be installed within a super-conducting solenoid with magnetic field up to 5 Tesla, and tested at high RF power. ...|$|R
50|$|Sensor-operated {{fixtures}} (faucets, soap dispensers, hand dryers, {{paper towel}} dispensers) {{prevent the spread}} of disease by allowing patrons to circumvent the need to touch common surfaces. Sensor-operated toilets also help conserve water by limiting the amount used per flush, and require less routine maintenance. Each sensor views through a small window into each fixture. Sometimes the metal plates that house the sensor <b>windows</b> are <b>bolted</b> on from behind, to prevent tampering. Additionally, all of the electrical equipment is safely behind the walls, so that there is no danger of electric shock. However, a RCCB must be used for all such electrical equipment.|$|R

I {{would not have the}} reader think, that, during this painful operation, she was unmoved. Her hand trembled, and--not being a brute--for some minutes (perhaps longer) she felt very badly, and the corners of her {{sensitive}} mouth were depressed. When her husband arrived, it was with a genuine joy that she ran to him, and nestled against his broad breast with a feeling of security that thrilled the honest fellow to the core.|$|R

The single engine, a Rolls-Royce Griffon drove contra-rotating propellers; radiators were mounted below the engine in the pylon. The rear of the pylon accommodated an observer's position with two <b>windows.</b> An eye <b>bolt</b> was fitted on the wing, behind the engine, so the aircraft could be easily lifted from the water by crane.|$|R

[...] For now, since the putting {{up of the}} curtains, the <b>window</b> had been <b>bolted</b> as well as closed. So Bell got up, and opened a passage for the squire's entrance. It was not often that he came down in this way, {{and when he did}} do so it was {{generally}} for some purpose which had been expressed before.|$|R
50|$|In 1960, the Post Office Investigation Branch (IB) {{recommended}} the fitting of alarms to all Travelling Post Offices with HVP carriages. This recommendation was implemented in 1961, but HVP carriages without alarms were retained in reserve. By August 1963, three HVP carriages were equipped with alarms, bars over the <b>windows</b> and <b>bolts</b> and catches on the doors, {{but at the}} time of the robbery, these carriages were out of service, so a reserve carriage (M30204M) without those features had to be used. The fitting of radios was also considered, but they were deemed to be too expensive, and the measure was not implemented. This carriage was kept for evidence for seven years following the event and then burned at a scrapyard in Norfolk in the presence of police and post office officials to deter any souvenir hunters.|$|R

Gus Grissom's flight on MR-4 had used a Mark II capsule, but it was necessary to test it on a proper orbital mission to ensure that the large window could handle the much higher heat of reentry there.|$|R
60|$|The ladder {{was barely}} placed when the Captain sprang upon it {{and ran up}} as, many a time before, he had run up the shrouds of his own vessel. A cheer from the crowd below greeted this display of activity, but it was changed into a laugh when the Captain, finding the <b>window</b> shut and <b>bolted,</b> want into the room head first, {{carrying}} frame and glass along with him! Divesting himself of the uncomfortable necklace, he looked hastily round. The smoke was pretty thick, but not sufficiently so to prevent his seeing poor Mrs Roby {{lying on the floor}} as if she had fallen down suffocated.|$|R
6000|$|As {{she entered}} {{and felt the}} warmth of the blazing fire, a glad look spread over her face. She made a {{movement}} as if to run to it. But she drew back an instant after, looking round with instinctive caution. She closed the <b>window</b> and <b>bolted</b> it, touched the lever which spread the grille across the opening, and pulled close the curtain behind it. Then she went swiftly to the door and tried if it was locked. Satisfied as to this, she came quickly over to the fire, and, kneeling before it, stretched out her numbed hands to the blaze. Almost on the instant her wet shroud began to steam. I stood wondering. The precautions of secrecy in the midst of her suffering--for that she did suffer was only too painfully manifest--must have presupposed some danger. Then and there my mind was made up that there should no harm assail her that I by any means could fend off. Still, the present must be attended to; pneumonia and other ills stalked behind such a chill as must infallibly come on her unless precautions were taken. I took again the dressing-gown which she had worn before and handed it to her, motioning as I did so towards the screen which had made a dressing-room for her on the former occasion. To my surprise she hesitated. I waited. She waited, too, and then laid down the dressing-gown {{on the edge of the}} stone fender. So I spoke: ...|$|R
6000|$|When I {{stepped out}} on the balcony, not {{thinking}} of my costume, I found that the woman was benumbed and hardly able to move. Even when I asked her to enter, and supplemented my words with gestures in case she should not understand my language, she stood stock-still, only rocking slightly to and fro {{as though she had}} just strength enough left to balance herself on her feet. I was afraid, from the condition in which she was, that she might drop down dead at any moment. So I took her by the hand to lead her in. But she seemed too weak to even make the attempt. When I pulled her slightly forward, thinking to help her, she tottered, and would have fallen had I not caught her in my arms. Then, half lifting her, I moved her forwards. Her feet, relieved of her weight, now seemed able to make the necessary effort; and so, I almost carrying her, we moved into the room. She was {{at the very end of}} her strength; I had to lift her over the sill. In obedience to her motion, I closed the French <b>window</b> and <b>bolted</b> it. I supposed the warmth of the room--though cool, it was warmer than the damp air without--affected her quickly, for on the instant she seemed to begin to recover herself. In a few seconds, as though she had reacquired her strength, she herself pulled the heavy curtain across the window. This left us in darkness, through which I heard her say in English: ...|$|R
5000|$|The sole {{transport}} to these remote areas and labor colonies was equally as strenuous: the NKVD loaded 50 people into one railroad car, {{together with their}} property. They had only one hole on the ground of the wagon which {{was used as a}} toilet. One witness claimed that 133 people were locked up in her wagon. The conditions in the overcrowded train wagons were exacerbated by a lack of hygiene, leading to cases of typhus. Since the trains only stopped to open the doors of the railroad cars at rare occasions during the trip, the sick inevitably contaminated others in the wagons. It was only when they arrived at their destination in the Uzbek SSR that the Crimean Tatars were released from the sealed off railroad cars. The first group of deportees started arriving in the Uzbek SSR on 29 May 1944 and had in the main arrived by 8 June 1944. Still, some were redirected to other destinations in Central Asia and had to continue their journey. Some witnesses claimed that they travelled in sealed off freight cars for 24 consecutive days. During this whole time, they were given very little food or water while trapped inside. There was even no fresh air, since the doors and <b>windows</b> were <b>bolted</b> shut. In Kazakh SSR, the transport guards unlocked the door only to toss out the corpses along the railroad. The Crimean Tatars thus called these railcars [...] "crematoria on wheels". The records show that at least 7,889 Crimean Tatars died during this long journey, amounting to about 4% of their entire nation. The huge mortality continued for several years even in exile due to malnutrition, labor exploitation, diseases, lack of medical care and exposure to harsh desert climate in Uzbekistan. The death toll was the highest during the first five years. In 1949 the Soviet authorities counted the number of the deported nations who lived in special settlements. According to their records, there were 44,887 excess deaths in these five years or 19.6% of that total group. Other sources give the figure of 44,125 deaths during that time, while a third source, alternative NKVD archives, gives a figure of 32,107 deaths. These reports included all the people resettled from Crimea (Armenians, Bulgarians, Greeks), even though the Crimean Tatars formed a clear majority in this group. It took five years until the number of births among the deported people started to surpass the number of deaths. Soviet archives reveal that between May 1944 and January 1945 a total of 13,592 Crimean Tatars perished in exile, about 7% of their entire population. Almost half of all deaths encompassed {{children under the age of}} 16 as well as around 1/4 of grown men: 6,096 of the dead were children, 4,525 women while only 2,562 were men. During 1945, a further 13,183 people died. Thus, by the end of December 1945, already at least 27,000 Crimean Tatars died in exile.|$|R
