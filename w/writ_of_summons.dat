The two remaining Boeing aircraft were re-registered with Aer Lingus on 10 June. By late August the debt in the company had been assessed to NOK30 million, making it the largest bankruptcy till then in Norwegian history. The largest creditor was Boeing, which was owed NOK7 million. The creditors and shareholders lost all of their investments in the company because the airline's limited assets were used to pay outstanding wages. Tjøntveit stated on 8 September that he intended to sue Boeing for damages from the seizure of the aircraft, but by October no <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>summons</b> had been received by the manufacturer.|$|E
5|$|The House of Lords Act 1999 {{removed the}} {{automatic}} right of hereditary peers {{to a seat}} in the House of Lords. Prior to the passage of this Act, anyone succeeding to a title in the peerage of England, Scotland, Ireland, Great Britain and the United Kingdom, would prove their succession by a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>summons</b> to Parliament. All peers receiving such writs were enrolled in the Register of Lords Spiritual and Temporal, a document maintained by the Clerk of the Parliaments. As a result of the Act, the Register of Lords Spiritual and Temporal only records the name of life peers and the 92 hereditary peers left in the House of Lords. This meant that the register was incomplete as it excludes most of the other hereditary peers, who {{are not part of the}} House of Lords.|$|E
5|$|The Serjeants had {{for many}} centuries {{exclusive}} {{jurisdiction over the}} Court of Common Pleas, being the only lawyers allowed {{to argue a case}} there. At the same time they had rights of audience in the other central common law courts (the Court of King's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas) and precedence over all other lawyers. Only Serjeants-at-Law could become judges of these courts right up into the 19th century, and socially the Serjeants ranked above Knights Bachelor and Companions of the Bath. Within the Serjeants-at-Law were more distinct orders; the King's Serjeants, particularly favoured Serjeants-at-Law, and within that the King's Premier Serjeant, the Monarch's most favoured Serjeant, and the King's Ancient Serjeant, the oldest. Serjeants (except King's Serjeants) were created by <b>Writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>Summons</b> under the Great Seal of the Realm and wore a special and distinctive dress, the chief feature of which was the coif, a white lawn or silk skullcap, afterwards represented by a round piece of white lace {{at the top of the}} wig.|$|E

5000|$|The {{complaint}} {{raised by the}} Lord Mayhew of Twysden was that the bill would not exclude hereditary peers {{for the remainder of}} that Parliament (but not future Parliaments), even though the bill provided that <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>summons</b> already issued would be of no effect. He suggested that such <b>writs</b> were already <b>of</b> no effect, because once a peer attends the House of Lords and presents his <b>writ,</b> the effect <b>of</b> the <b>writ</b> is spent, and the peer immediately becomes a member of the House until Parliament is dissolved. (Once a new Parliament is called, new <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>summons</b> must be issued.) ...|$|R
25|$|Barons sat in Parliament by a {{combination}} <b>of</b> tenure and <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>summons</b> issued to them. If a woman held a barony, her husband was summoned to Parliament in her right. The concept of a barony as a personal dignity not tied to land arose only when, in about 1388, Richard II created John Beauchamp a baron by letters patent. The Lord de Beauchamp was a baron not by tenure but rather by {{the will of the}} Crown. Letters patent and <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>summons</b> were both used to create peerage dignities until the reign of Henry VIII, when the latter method fell into desuetude. Some peerage dignities, however, have since been created by <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>summons</b> since that time. In most cases, such peerage dignities were created when a writ was issued to an individual under the misapprehension that he was entitled to a peerage dignity created by letters patent. The Barony of Strange {{is an example of a}} peerage dignity created due to an error.|$|R
25|$|Earls {{appear to}} have sat in Parliament {{by virtue of their}} baronies, and not their earldoms. The {{separation}} of the two dignities seems to have arisen after the advent of the usage of letters patent to create peerage dignities. In some cases, a baron who held a dignity created by a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>summons</b> was created an Earl, and the two dignities later separated, the barony devolving upon the heir-general, and the earldom to an heir-male.|$|E
25|$|On an {{unrecorded}} date {{earlier than}} 30 June 1308, {{when the couple}} were jointly granted the manor of Bourne, Sussex, Margaret married Bartholomew de Badlesmere, an English soldier and court official who was afterwards created 1st Baron Badlesmere by <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>summons.</b> He had held the post of Governor of Bristol Castle since 1307, and during his life accumulated many renumerative grants and offices. It is feasible that Margaret's marriage to Badlesmere had been arranged by her brother-in-law, Baron Clifford; Badlesmere having been one of Clifford's retainers during the Scottish Wars. Clifford was later killed at the Battle of Bannockburn, where Badlesmere also fought.|$|E
25|$|The Peerage, still, {{was not an}} {{hereditary}} body. Kings did {{not consider}} themselves, having once summoned an individual, bound to summon the same individual, much less his heirs, to future Parliaments. Thus, writs were issued at the whim of the King. Over time, however, the arbitrary power of the Crown was fettered by the principles of hereditary right. At first, the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>summons</b> {{was regarded as a}} burden and interference, but later, when Parliament's power increased, it was seen as a sign of royal favour. Since the Crown was itself an hereditary dignity, it seemed natural for seats in the upper House of Parliament to be so as well. By the beginning of the fourteenth century, the Peerage had evolved its hereditary characteristics. Since under Norman customs, estates devolved under the principles of primogeniture, seats in Parliament did so as well.|$|E
5000|$|An {{hereditary}} peer is a peer {{of the realm}} whose dignity may be inherited; those able to inherit it {{are said to be}} [...] "in remainder". Hereditary peerage dignities may be created with <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>summons</b> or by letters patent; the former method is now obsolete. <b>Writs</b> <b>of</b> <b>summons</b> summon an individual to Parliament, in the old feudal tradition, and merely implied the existence or creation of an {{hereditary peer}}age dignity, which is automatically inherited, presumably according to the traditional medieval rules (male-preference primogeniture, similar to the succession of the British crown). Letters patent explicitly create a dignity and specify its course of inheritance (usually agnatic succession, like the Salic Law). Some hereditary titles can pass through and vest in female heirs in a system called coparcenary.|$|R

25|$|With a few limited exceptions, the High Court has the {{jurisdiction}} {{to hear and}} try any action in personam (that is, directed towards a particular person) where the defendant is served with a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>summons</b> or other originating process in or outside Singapore, or where the defendant submits to the Court's jurisdiction. In theory, the Court has unlimited original jurisdiction – it can hear any type of case no matter how trivial or serious. In practice, though, parties may be penalized by having to pay higher costs (legal fees) {{if they choose to}} bring a civil case before the High Court when it is more appropriately dealt with by a subordinate court. Generally, except in probate matters, a civil case must be commenced in the High Court if the value of the claim exceeds S$250,000. Probate matters are commenced in the High Court only if the value of the deceased's estate exceeds $3 million, or if the case involves the resealing of a foreign grant of probate or letters of administration.|$|E

2500|$|The {{manner of}} {{summoning}} barons to the Council was {{influential in the}} development of the Peerage. Ecclesiastical dignitaries and the greater barons were summoned by a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>summons</b> issued directly from the King, while lesser barons were summoned through the local sheriffs. Such a system existed as early as 1164, when Henry II withheld a personal summons to Thomas Becket, Archbishop of Canterbury, after engaging with him in a conflict with over the rights of the Church, instead subjecting him to a summons through a sheriff. For the rest of the twelfth century, the dividing line between barons summoned by writs personally addressed to them and barons summoned through the sheriffs became well-defined, but the Crown sometimes arbitrarily subjected the greater barons to summons through sheriffs. In the Magna Carta, King John declared, [...] "we will cause to be summoned the archbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and greater barons, severally by our letters." [...] He also agreed that the lesser barons would be [...] "summoned generally, through our sheriffs and bailiffs." ...|$|E
2500|$|Thomas Manners (c. 14881543), {{son of the}} 11th Baron de Ros of Hamlake, Truibut and Belvoir, {{was created}} Earl of Rutland in the Peerage of England in 1525. He was the {{great-grandson}} of Richard Plantagenet. The barony of 'de Ros of Hamlake, Truibut and Belvoir' (sometimes spelled Ros, Roos or de Roos) was created by Simon de Montfort with a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>summons</b> to the House of Lords for Robert de Ros (12231285) in 1264. [...] The title may pass through the female line {{when there is no}} male heir, and accordingly, when the 3rd Earl, Edward Manners (c. 15481587), left no sons, the barony of Ros passed to the family of his daughter Elizabeth (d. 1591) who became the wife of the 2nd Earl of Exeter. The 3rd Earl was succeeded as 4th Earl by his brother John (d. 1588). The barony of Ros was restored to the Manners family when Francis Manners, the 6th Earl (15781632), inherited it in 1618 from his cousin William Cecil (15901618). However, Francis died without male issue and the assumption of the courtesy title of Lord Ros for the eldest son of subsequent earls appears to have had no legal basis. On the death of the seventh Earl in 1641 the Earldom passed to his distant cousin John Manners of Haddon Hall, grandson of the second son of the first Earl.|$|E

50|$|The {{privilege}} which {{balanced the}} burden of the servitium debitum was the baron's right to attend the king's council.

6000|$|But the sharpest-cut {{example is}} France; {{to which we}} {{constantly}} return for illustration. France, with its keen intellect, saw the truth and saw the falsity, in those Protestant times; and, with its ardor of generous impulse, was prone enough to adopt the former. France was within a hair's-breadth of becoming actually Protestant. But France saw good to massacre Protestantism, and end it in the night of St. Bartholomew, 1572.

But the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>Summons</b> had been served; Heaven's Messenger could not stay away forever.

They were Roman Catholics, which probably brought him the Mallory case, for Hatton is of the old church; better than that, they were all gentlemen of great estate, and there is no doubt their champion was well rewarded for his successful service. They say he is very rich. At present all the business of the country connected with descents flows into his chambers. Not a pedigree in dispute, not a peerage in abeyance, which is not submitted to his consideration.

In June 1530, Hussey was named Lincolnshire Castle's Commissioner for Gaol Delivery, and later that same year, Hussey sold some of his large holdings (the Somersetshire manors of Batheaston, Bathampton, Bathford, Twerton; the Wiltshire manors of Compton Bassett, Comerwell, and North Wraxall).|$|R
5000|$|The Government, meanwhile, argued otherwise. They {{noted that}} [...] "The command is not spent once the peer turns up at Parliament - the monarch desires the {{counsel of the}} peer {{throughout}} the Parliament, and the command expressed in the writ ... continue to have effect throughout that Parliament. Plainly, the monarch's command would not be fully obeyed by a peer who answered the summons, arrived at Parliament and then immediately departed again."

And he will presently see a confirmation of these statements in the bad name which the Sá Leonite bears upon {{the whole of the}} western coast. Yet, I repeat, the colony is changed for the better, physically by a supply of pure water, morally by the courage which curbed the black abuse. Twenty years ago to call a negro 'nigger' was actionable; many a 5l. has been paid for the indulgence of lèse-majesté against the 'man and brother;' and not a few 50l. when the case was brought into the civil courts. After a rough word the Sá Leonite would shake his fist at you and trot off exclaiming, 'Lawyer Rainy (or Montague) lib for town!' A case of mild assault, which in England would be settled by a police-magistrate and a fine of five shillings, became at Freetown a serious 'bob.' Niger, accompanied by his friends or his 'company,' betook himself to some limb of the law, possibly a pettifogger, certainly a pauper who braved a deadly climate for uncertain lucre. His interest was to promote litigation and to fill his pockets by what is called sharp practice. After receiving the preliminary fee of 5l., to be paid out of the plunder, he demanded exemplary damages, and the defendant was lightened of all he could afford to pay. When the offender was likely to leave the station, the modus operandi was as follows. The <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> <b>summons</b> was issued. The lawyer strongly recommended an apology and a promise to defray costs, with the warning that judgment would go by default against the absentee. If the defendant prudently 'stumped up,' the affair ended; if not, a capias was taken out, and the law ran its course. A jury was chosen, and I have already told the results.|$|E
