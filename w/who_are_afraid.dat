There are also people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid.</b> The idea of bringing S.H.I.E.L.D. back into the light is to ease their fears. So it’s going to be mixed." [...] Elaborating on this fear of Inhumans, Whedon said, [...] "the fun part about a genre TV show is you can speak in metaphor. There is a lot of fear of the other in our world right now. We get to do that with humans and Inhumans. We get to tackle those issues head-on without ever really talking about them." ...|$|E

2500|$|In any case, this {{dispersion}} worldwide corresponds {{completely with}} {{the spiritual and}} apostolic vision of Fr. d’Alzon, who remained quite French, not to say “Nîmois” (a southerner) : “it is necessary to expand minds and hearts when dealing with the great question of the cause of God, to open broad horizons for the short-sighted, and to light a fire under those who are only looking to warm their feet and <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> of catching a cold if they are subjected to too much heat.

2500|$|In January 1915, Wilson {{emerged from}} his {{depression}} during a spirited speech in Indianapolis where he said, [...] "the trouble with the Republican Party {{is that it has}} not had a new idea for thirty years… the Republican Party is still a covert and a refuge for those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid,</b> {{for those who want to}} consult their grandfathers about everything." [...] Another sign of Wilson's emotional restoration was the aggressiveness with which he pursued passage of a ship-purchase bill to bulk up the inadequately equipped merchant marine. This lasted until March 1915, when he moderated, drew back from the bill and, without its passage, congratulated the Congress for its work in the session just ended—his initial journey through mourning was evident.|$|E

[...] In a highly publicized Vanity Fair interview, lead actress Katherine Heigl admitted that though she enjoyed working with Apatow, she had a hard time enjoying Knocked Up herself, calling the movie [...] "a little sexist", saying that the film [...] "paints the women as shrews, as humorless and uptight". In response to accusations of sexism, Apatow told an interviewer that the characters in the film Knocked Up [...] "are sexist at times... but it's really about immature people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> of women and relationships and learn to grow up." ...|$|E

2500|$|The album's [...] "most startling" [...] {{song was}} {{considered}} [...] "What About," [...] in which Jackson violently confronts domestic abuse.

2500|$|Wen is {{perceived}} by some observers {{as a liberal}} voice in China's ruling elite. Wen has openly talked about democracy and increased freedoms in his speeches and interviews with foreign correspondents, although {{much of it was}} deemed [...] "sensitive" [...] commentary and censored in state media. Wen remarked that [...] "someone who speaks is not a criminal, someone who listens is duly warned" [...] ( [...] , which alludes to the classical work Shi Jing) at an internal party conference in 2009, an event reported on Xinhua and other state networks. His remarks triggered debate from netizens, as it seemed to contravene the practices of the Communist Party, particularly in its suppression of dissent. Analysts noted that Wen's message was aimed at party members, and not necessarily the general public because Wen believes freedom of speech has deteriorated since Hu Jintao's accession to power and has negatively affected China's political landscape and international reputation. His comments also ostensibly addressed the pervasive [...] "fake-talking" [...] present in Chinese political circles, in an attempt to curb systemic and institutional woes stemming from officials <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>afraid</b> to speak the truth.|$|E

Fifty-five percent of respondents <b>were</b> <b>afraid</b> of falling; of those <b>who</b> <b>were</b> <b>afraid,</b> 56 % had curtailed activity due to this fear.
