Slater goes on to explain that four volunteers have gone in, but never returned. Some garbled communications came through, but nothing else.

Crowley said that the USA was wary of India's rigid stand on nuclear policy and of then prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, who <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> with nuclear tests.

40|$|Work anecdotes {{and popular}} media {{programs}} such as Office Space, The Office, and Dilbert {{suggest that there are}} a number of workers in the United States who feel a sense of apathy toward their workplace and their job. This article develops these ideas theoretically and provides validity evi-dence for a scale of job apathy across two studies. Job apathy is defined as a type of selective apathy characterized by diminished motivation and affect toward one’s job. A scale of job apathy was developed and data from a sample of currently or recently employed college students supported two dimensions: apathetic action and apathetic thought. Job apathy was found to be empirically distinct from clinical apathy, negative affectivity, cynicism, and employee engagement. Job apathy was also found to have incremental validity in the prediction of personal initiative, withdrawal, and organizational deviance. Practical implications and future research directions for job apathy are discussed. Keywords job apathy, employee engagement, motivation, deviance, validation Yeah.

50|$|However, the {{situation}} for the party soon turned difficult. Large sections of the Soviet and North Korean communist leaderships did not trust the party, and {{saw it as a}} potential nest for counterrevolutionaries. The most troublesome issue was that the North Korean Ch'ŏndogyo continued to have contacts with the leadership of the religious group in South Korean Seoul. There, the Ch'ŏndogyo leadership was anti-communist and supported the administration of President Syngman Rhee. In January 1948, the Ch'ŏndogyo leadership based in Seoul made a decision that a massive anti-communist demonstration would be held on 1 March in Pyongyang. This put the Chondist Chongu Party in the North in a precarious situation. Kim Tarhyŏn refused to follow the orders from Seoul, but others in the party leadership <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> with the plans. The result was a massive purge of party members throughout North Korea.
