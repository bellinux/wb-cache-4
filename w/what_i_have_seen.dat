5|$|A plain {{soldier and}} {{business}} man. I am no politician, nor have I {{any desire to}} be one. In {{the course of my}} commercial career it has been my fate to have had much experience of politicians and their ways. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> in the course of that experience has given me little respect either for the professional politician or his methods. I am desirous of seeing this country governed in the ways of clear common sense and good sound business principles, and I think that desire of mine is heartily share by {{the vast majority of the}} population.|$|E
500|$|He {{started the}} 2003–04 season at Rochdale, making 16 {{appearances}} and scoring five goals in League Two. Rochdale's new manager Steve Parkin criticised McEvilly's fitness level {{to play and}} had described him as [...] "too heavy", and that he needed [...] "to get his physique down to an acceptable weight where he can get around the pitch". Conference National club Accrington Stanley signed McEvilly on a one-month loan in January 2004, making his debut in their 3–0 home win against Tamworth on 20 January. Despite playing out of position in wide right, McEvilly commented; [...] "I was playing out of position but it was okay". He went on to describe the drop in level he said; [...] "I have never played in the Conference but, from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> it is no different to Division Three." [...] After a month at Accrington and making three appearances scoring one goal, his loan was extended in February for a further month, with manager John Coleman praising him as [...] "a great acquisition to the squad". McEvilly went on to make a further three appearances, scoring once more before returning to Rochdale. On his return to Rochdale, he scored a further one goal in 14 appearances. At {{the end of the}} season, McEvilly was released by Rochdale on 10 May, signing a dater for Accrington Stanley on a permanent basis after a previous loan spell. On 13 November 2004, McEvilly scored a hat-trick in Accrington's 5–0 home victory over Northwich Victoria. During the 2004–05 season he made 39 appearances in the Conference National, scoring 15 goals.|$|E
2500|$|Wisconsin {{formerly}} {{had virtually}} unrestricted trapping of painted turtles, but in 1997, based on qualitative observations, forbid all commercial harvesting. [...] "Based on <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> over the years, I believe that turtle densities are way down," [...] said Wisconsin state herpetologist Robert Hay.|$|E
60|$|Addicted as I am to the cinematograph, {{in which}} the {{standard}} of study furniture is particularly rich and high, I found something very cooling and simple and refreshing {{in the sight of}} the king's study furniture. He sat down with me at a little useful writing table, and after asking me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> in Italy and hearing <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> and <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was to see, he went on talking, very good talk indeed.|$|R

2500|$|Pocahontas was {{apparently}} treated well in London. At the masque, her seats {{were described as}} [...] "well placed", and, according to Purchas, John King, Bishop of London, [...] "entertained her with festival state and pomp beyond <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> in his greate hospitalitie afforded to other ladies".|$|E

2500|$|A {{number of}} the rebels were hanged {{including}} Samuel Lount and Peter Matthews, others were shot. Their deaths were a strong motivation for the continuing Patriot War. Many more prisoners were transported, but most were pardoned, e.g. Enoch Moore (Loyalist turned rebel). A general pardon (for everyone but Mackenzie) was issued in 1845, and Mackenzie himself was pardoned in 1849 and {{allowed to return to}} Canada, where he resumed his political career. [...] Mackenzie was strongly disillusioned after his time in the United States, writing to his son that [...] "after <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> here, I frankly confess to you that, had I passed nine years in the United States before, instead of after, the outbreak, I am sure I would have been the last man in America to be engaged in it." [...] In later life however, Mackenzie advocated annexation of Canada by the United States.|$|E

2500|$|... {{inspired}} from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> on {{the street}} these days: fans who have approached me, the people around me, and from my own personal experiences. I share the sadness that has been created in many by our separation. I, myself, am immersed in that state because few things have been so important {{to me in my}} life as Soda Stereo. Everyone knows {{that it is impossible to}} lead a band without a certain level of conflict. It is a fragile equilibrium in the war of ideas that very few are able to handle for fifteen years, as we proudly did [...] But, ultimately, different personal and musical misunderstandings began to compromise that equilibrium... excuses were generated for not confronting ourselves, excuses for a future group that we no longer believed in as we did in the past. To end for the sake of the band is, in its redundancy, to [...] to our mental health, and above all to show respect for all of our fans who have followed us for such a long time. Goodbye.|$|E
2500|$|On 24 February 1964, Morris Berthold Abram, the {{president}} of the American Jewish Committee and supported by a United States representative to the United Nation's Commission on Human Rights, brought Kitchko's work to worldwide attention by attacking the book during a press conference. Shortly afterwards, international criticism was leveled at Kitchko and his book. Communist parties worldwide condemned the work. The French communist newspaper, L'Humanité denounced the book and demanded the Soviet Union disavow the work. Gus Hall, the secretary-general of the United States Communist Party, stated [...] "there {{is no doubt in my}} mind about the anti-Semitic character of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen.</b> Such stereotyped, slanderous caricatures of the Jewish people must be unequivocally condemned." [...] To exploit this discontent with the Soviet Union, the American Central Intelligence Agency had the book translated into French to be distributed to left-wing groups across Europe. When Khrushchev toured Scandinavia, in the spring of 1964, demonstrations took place against the USSR's treatment of Jews, in part motivated by the publication of Judaism Without Embellishment. In the Ukraine, reaction to the book was also negative. Ukrainian nationalist Mykola Lebed saw the book [...] "as a Soviet attempt to paint Ukrainians with a broad anti-Semitic brush". The result was Ukrainians, especially amongst the former supports of Stepan Bandera, switching from using anti-Semitism as a weapon to use against the Soviet authorities to attacking the Soviet Government for being anti-Semitic.|$|E

60|$|At our meal {{my uncle}} asked me <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> {{that day and}} I replied--naught but figures and crabbed writing--and handed him the parchments which he {{compared}} item by item.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I did not, but I heard quite enough. Everyone {{knew that}} you were going in a day or two, and that was enough for me after <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> in the afternoon." ...|$|R
60|$|Much {{saddened by}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen,</b> <b>I</b> took my {{departure}} from them, {{and the three}} of us made our way back to the launch, accompanied by about five hundred men, women, girls, and boys.|$|R

60|$|But when I {{returned}} to America I {{met with a}} great disappointment: my glowing anticipations were not realized. I could find scarcely any one who cared to know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen,</b> heard, or done.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ptolemy," [...] I answered, [...] "we {{shall be}} {{fortunate}} {{if we get}} ourselves alive out of Mur, let alone these bones and ancient treasures," [...] and <b>I</b> told him <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> that evening.|$|R

60|$|Upon recovering, {{my first}} impulse, of course, was to inform my friend of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> and heard--and <b>I</b> can {{scarcely}} explain what feeling of repugnance it was which, in the end, operated to prevent me.|$|R
6000|$|He then {{proceeded}} to make some further remarks, with so much equanimity and composure that I began to think he <b>had</b> really not <b>seen</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen,</b> and <b>I</b> whispered--"Miss Fanshawe is here: have you noticed her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How can I see <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen,</b> {{and hold}} my peace!' {{returned}} the locksmith. 'Who was that man, and why has his coming made {{this change in}} you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think that}} we shall be quite all right," [...] he assured her. [...] "Thanks very much for finding me the charts. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>seen</b> will help me." ...|$|E

60|$|I forgave him, comforted him, revived him; {{but there}} were moments when the remembrance of <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> troubled me in secret, and when I asked myself if I really possessed my husband's full {{confidence}} as he possessed mine.|$|R
60|$|And <b>I,</b> remembering <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> in {{the blue}} parlour, was silent--for I could not lie. So she flung my hand away with a bitter laugh, and picked lightly from the table anear a small dagger with a jewelled handle.|$|R
