25|$|When Henry is {{pronounced}} dead, Emma and Regina {{return to the}} Hospital {{to say goodbye to}} his body. Emma kisses him on the forehead, causing a pulse of energy to engulf the entire town and restore everyone's true memories while freeing Henry from the effects of the poisoned apple. Snow and Charming reunite with each other and Regina returns to her mansion alone as Emma begins to wonder why no one is returning to the Other World since the curse is broken. Rumplestiltskin reunites with his true love Belle (Emilie de Ravin) and takes her to a <b>Wishing</b> <b>Well</b> {{deep in the heart of}} the forest, a well with the power to restore that which one had lost.

Meanwhile, Jacinda finds Lucy at the <b>wishing</b> <b>well</b> in the community garden, who tells her that she found Henry, despite her mother's skepticism. Jacinda then returns the laptop back to Henry, and the two are encouraged by Roni to share a drink. However, Victoria shows up, ready to buy out Roni's bar and to deal with Jacinda, telling her that she'll be taking full custody of Lucy. Henry attempts to defuse the tension between the three, but is warned by Victoria to stay out of her business. Afterwards, Lucy meets him at the garden, and attempts to convince him about the curse, only for Henry to reveal that his wife and child perished in a fire years ago. Finding that his car has been stolen, Henry goes to the nearby police station, and reports it missing to a cursed Killian Jones, who now lives as Officer Rogers with no memories of his past life. In another part of town, Tilly enters an abandoned warehouse to find her boss, Rumpelstiltskin, now living under the cursed identity of Detective Weaver, and informs him of Henry's arrival.|$|E

2500|$|The {{path that}} goes through Luray Caverns {{starts at the}} entrance. Next it curves {{throughout}} the caverns until you reach Dream Lake.

2500|$|Another {{local custom}} at Askham is the {{throwing}} of coins {{from the nearby}} bridge onto a boulder that lies below the water level of the river.

[...] Obvious connections exist with water generally and the practice of throwing in coins to seek favours of the water spirits. The Lady's Well in Kilmaurs, Scotland, is a typical <b>wishing</b> <b>well.</b> At St. Cuby's Well (SX224 564) in Cornwall the legend was that if anyone did not leave an offering of money then they would be followed home by Piskies in the shape of flying moths, embodying the spirits of the dead.
