40|$|Wet-only, dry-only, bulk {{deposition}} and deposition of sedimentary particles and gases deposited {{after the last}} rain (DAR) were collected weekly at La Castanya station in the Montseny mountains (NE Spain, 41 ° 46 ′N, 2 ° 21 ′E) from February 2009 to July 2010. These samples were analysed for pH, alkalinity, and the concentrations of major ions (Cl⁻, NO₃⁻, SO₄²⁻, Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, NH₄⁺). Significant differences were observed between bulk and wet-only precipitation, with an enrichment of ions associated to coarse particles in {{bulk deposition}}. The comparison between wet and dry fluxes revealed that the removal of compounds at Montseny occurred mainly by wet deposition, which accounted for 74 % of total deposition. The dry flux was characterised by the predominance of K⁺, Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺, which are related to coarse particles. Bulk collection methods at Montseny were considered representative of total atmospheric deposition, since bulk deposition plus DAR accounted for 97 % of total deposition measured with <b>wet</b> and dry-only <b>collection</b> <b>devices.</b> Thus, bulk deposition collectors can be recommended for deposition networks at remote sites (lacking electricity connection) in environments, where coarse particles are a predominant fraction of the aerosol mass...|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} new type of {{portable}} hydraulic turbine that uses the kinetic energy of flow in open channels. The turbine comprises a runner with an appended <b>collection</b> <b>device</b> that includes a diffuser section in an attempt to improve the output by catching and accelerating the flow. With such turbines, the performance of the <b>collection</b> <b>device,</b> and a composite body comprising the runner and <b>collection</b> <b>device</b> were studied using numerical analysis. Among four stand-alone <b>collection</b> <b>devices,</b> the inlet velocity ratio was most improved by the <b>collection</b> <b>device</b> featuring an inlet nozzle and brim. The inlet velocity ratio of the composite body was significantly lower than that of the stand-alone <b>collection</b> <b>device,</b> owing to the resistance of the runner itself, the decreased diffuser pressure recovery coefficient, and the increased backpressure coefficient. However, at the maximum output tip speed ratio, the inlet velocity ratio and the loading coefficient were approximately 31 % and 22 % higher, respectively, for the composite body than for the isolated runner. In particular, the input power coefficient significantly increased (by approximately 2. 76 times) owing to the increase in the inlet velocity ratio. Verification tests were also conducted in a real canal to establish the actual effectiveness of the turbine...|$|R

40|$|Improper {{design or}} use of blood <b>collection</b> <b>devices</b> can {{adversely}} affect the accuracy of laboratory test results. Vascular access devices, such as cathe-ters and needles, exert shear forces during blood flow, which creates a predisposition to cell lysis. Components from blood collection tubes, such as stoppers, lubricants, surfactants, and separator gels, can leach into specimens and/or adsorb analytes from a specimen; special tube additives may also alter analyte stability. Because of these interactions with blood specimens, blood <b>collection</b> <b>devices</b> are a potential source of pre-analytical error in laboratory testing. Accurate laboratory testing requires {{an understanding of the}} complex interactions between <b>collection</b> <b>devices</b> and blood spe-cimens. Manufacturers, vendors, and clinical laboratorians must consider the pre-analytical challenges in laboratory testing. Although other authors have described the effects of endogenous substances on clinical assay results, the effects/impact of blood collection tube additives and components have not been well systematically described or explained.

40|$|Studies are {{difficult}} in areas lacking modern facilities {{due to the}} inability to reliably collect, store, and ship samples. Thus, we sought {{to evaluate the use}} of a dry plasma <b>collection</b> <b>device</b> for seroepidemiology studies. Plasma was obtained by fingerstick using a commercial dry plasma <b>collection</b> <b>device</b> (Chemcard Plasma <b>Collection</b> <b>Device)</b> and serum (venipuncture) from individuals in Kazakhstan. Plasma samples were air dried for 15 min and then stored desiccated in foil zip-lock pouches at 4 to 6 °C and subsequently shipped to the United States by air at ambient temperature. Serum samples remained frozen at − 20 °C until assayed. Helicobacter pylori status was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (HM-CAP EIA) for the dry plasma and the serum samples. The results were concordant in 250 of the 289 cases (86. 5 %). In 25 cases (8. 6 %), the dry plasma samples gave indeterminate results and could not be retested because only one sample was collected. Five serum samples were positive, and the corresponding dry plasma samples were negative; one serum sample was negative, and the corresponding plasma sample was positive. The relative sensitivity and specificity of the Chemcard samples to serum were 97. 6 and 97. 9 %, respectively, excluding those with indeterminate results. Repeated freeze-thawing had no adverse effect on the accuracy of the test. We found the dry plasma <b>collection</b> <b>device</b> to provide an accurate and practical alternative to serum when venipuncture may be difficult or inconvenient and sample storage and handling present difficulties, especially for seroepidemiologic studies in rural areas or developing countries and where freeze-thawing may be unavoidable...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives. This study {{proposes a}} novel urine <b>{{collection}}</b> <b>device</b> that can divide each urine collection into 20 parts and store and cool just one part. The {{aim of the}} current study is to compare measured biomarkers from the proposed urine <b>collection</b> <b>device</b> to those of conventional 24 -hour sampling method. We also hypothesized that the new method would significantly increase patients’ adherence to the timed urine collection. Methods. Two 24 -hour urine samples with the conventional method and with the new automated urine <b>collection</b> <b>device</b> that uses just one-twentieth of each void were obtained from 40 healthy volunteers. Urine parameters including volume, creatinine, and protein levels were compared between the two methods and the agreement of two measurements for each subject was reported through Bland-Altman plots. Results. Our results confirmed that for all three variables, there is a positive correlation P< 0. 001 between the two measurements and high degree of agreement could be seen in Bland-Altman plots. Moreover, more subjects reported the new method as “more convenient” for 24 -hour urine collection. Conclusions. Our results clearly indicate that a fixed proportion of each void may significantly reduce the urine volume in timed collections and this, in turn, may increase subjects’ adherence to this difficult sampling...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background We have {{previously}} shown {{that use of}} an EC brush device {{in combination with the}} Rovers Cervex-Brush (SurePath broom) offered no significant improvement in EC recovery. Here we determine if use of additional <b>collection</b> <b>devices</b> enhance the diagnostic utility of the SurePath Pap for gynecologic cytology. Methods After informed consent, 37 women ages 18 – 56 receiving their routine cervical examinations were randomized into four experimental groups. Each group was first sampled with the SurePath broom then immediately re-sampled with an additional <b>collection</b> <b>device</b> or devices. Group 1 : Rover endocervix brush (n = 8). Group 2 : Medscand CytoBrush Plus GT (n = 7). Group 3 : Rover spatula + endocervix brush (n = 11). Group 4 : Medscand spatula + CytoBrush Plus GT (n = 11). Results Examination of SurePath broom-collected cytology yielded the following abnormal diagnoses: atypia (n = 2), LSIL (n = 5) and HSIL (n = 3). Comparison of these diagnoses to those obtained from paired samples using the additional <b>collection</b> <b>devices</b> showed that use of a second and or third device yielded no additional abnormal diagnoses. Importantly, use of additional devices did not improve upon the abnormal cell recovery of the SurePath broom and in 4 / 10 cases under-predicted or did not detect the SurePath broom-collected lesion as confirmed by cervical biopsy. Finally, in 36 / 37 cases, the SurePath broom successfully recovered ECs. Use of additional devices, in Group 3, augmented EC recovery to 37 / 37. Conclusions Use of additional <b>collection</b> <b>devices</b> in conjunction with the SurePath broom did not enhance diagnostic utility of the SurePath Pap. A potential but not significant improvement in EC recovery might be seen with the use of three devices. </p...|$|R
