5|$|Hurricane Debra was a {{destructive}} tropical cyclone that {{developed during the}} 1959 Atlantic hurricane season. The fifth tropical storm and third hurricane of the season, Debra originated from the interaction of a cold-core low and a tropical wave on July15. The system was designated a tropical depression on July23 when it was south of Louisiana and meandered westward <b>while</b> <b>it</b> swiftly intensified into a tropical storm along the Gulf Coast of the United States. A turn towards the northwest became evident as it attained Category1 hurricane status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale the following day <b>while</b> <b>it</b> organized into a developed storm. As the hurricane curved northward at a slow forward speed, strength was maintained as it approached the coast of Texas as a minimal hurricane. It came ashore during the evening of July24 local time (0000UTC on July25) between Freeport and Galveston, Texas. It rapidly weakened into a tropical storm and later a depression as it moved inland, and dissipated on July28 <b>while</b> <b>it</b> turned northwestward. The remnant moisture later sparked upper-level thunderstorms in late July and early August.|$|E
