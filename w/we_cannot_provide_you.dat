Methods We sequenced the coding region and splice sites of WNT 4 in 145 Han Chinese women with premature ovarian failure (POF) and 200 healthy controls. Results Only one novel variation, in Exon 2 (195 C > T), was detected among the women with POF. However, this synonymous variation did not result in a change in amino acid sequence (65 Asp > Asp). No further variants were found in any of the samples.

Comparing these methods using the little overlap that may exist would not provide meaningful conclusions due to the varied nature of the studies. Thus, these are shortcomings of the current research.
