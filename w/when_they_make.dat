5|$|After {{the opening}} on Downtown Line, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan {{announced}} that public transport fare rules will be reviewed {{to allow for}} transfers across MRT lines at different stations as the rail network is getting denser. Currently, commuters are charged a second time <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> such transfers. He added that the Public Transport Council (PTC) will review distance-based fare transfer rules to ensure they continue to facilitate “fast, seamless” public transport journeys. The review of distance-based fare rules on MRT lines {{is expected to be}} completed in the first quarter in 2018.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{this family}} are chiefly known for their {{characteristic}} behaviour; they mostly forage for insect prey on the trunks and branches of trees, and often communicate by drumming with their beak, producing a reverberatory sound that can be heard at some distance. Some species vary their diet with fruits, bird's eggs and small animals, and some suck sap. They mostly nest and roost in holes that they excavate in tree trunks, and their abandoned holes are of importance to other cavity-nesting birds. They sometimes come into conflict with man <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> holes in buildings or feed on fruit crops, but perform a useful service by their removal of insect pests on trees.|$|E

5|$|Riesling {{wines are}} often {{consumed}} when young, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> a fruity and aromatic wine {{which may have}} aromas of green or other apples, grapefruit, peach, gooseberry, honey, rose blossom or cut green grass, and usually a crisp taste due to the high acidity. However, Riesling's naturally high acidity and range of flavours make it suitable for extended aging. International wine expert Michael Broadbent rates aged German Rieslings, some hundreds of years old, highly. Sweet Riesling wines, such as German Trockenbeerenauslese are especially suited for cellaring since the high sugar content provides for additional preservation. However, high quality dry or off-dry Riesling wine is also known to have not just survived but also been enjoyable at an age exceeding 100 years.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels {{normally}} nest in crevices between {{or under}} rocks, or burrow in the soil. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> their own tunnels, they loosen {{the earth with}} their bills and kick out the debris with their feet. The birds less commonly nest in walls, under buildings or down rabbit burrows. Disused or occupied burrows of Atlantic puffins and Manx shearwaters are sometimes used, and the petrel pair may share a common entrance with those seabirds, rabbits or other pairs of its own species. Where other occupants are present, the petrels dig a side burrow or use an existing low-roofed tunnel which the larger birds or rabbits cannot easily enter. Even so, puffins and shearwaters will sometimes access and destroy nests, and adult petrels may be killed by their larger neighbours. Human-made plastic nesting tubes are readily used, and may provide protection against predators. Birds usually mate for life and use the same hole every year.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-five years pass, and Pulikecei is now {{the king}} of Cholapuram Paalayam. As foretold, he is foolish as well as lecherous. He is a puppet {{in the hands of}} Sangilimayan, who collaborates with the British for his own {{personal}} gain, and does not attend {{to the needs of the}} people of his kingdom. Pulikecei also tortures his subjects. He creates an outdoor stadium for different castes to fight against each other and punishes his palace guards even <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> the slightest of mistakes; he also uses his guards as targets for shooting practice. Ukraputhan, now an educated revolutionary, collaborates with his friends to overthrow the British. Ukraputhan falls in love with Vasantha Sundari, who reciprocates his feelings. When Ukraputhan tries to kill Pulikecei, he is shocked to see that they look alike.|$|E

25|$|The {{greater rhea}} is a silent bird except during mating season, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> low booming noises, and as chicks, when {{they give a}} mournful whistle. During the non-breeding season they will form flocks of between 10 and 100 birds. When in flocks, {{they tend to be}} less vigilant, but the males can get {{aggressive}} towards other males. When chased they will flee in a zigzag pattern, alternately raising one wing then the other. These flocks break up in the winter in time for breeding season.|$|E
25|$|Depending {{on whether}} selling or buying, sellers or buyers use a ridiculously high, or ridiculously low opening offer {{that is not}} achievable.

Another advantage is that the party giving the extreme demand appears more flexible <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> concessions toward a more reasonable outcome.

25|$|King {{penguins}} eat {{small fish}} and squid and rely less than most Southern Ocean predators on krill and other crustaceans.

25|$|Openly {{transsexual}} {{people can}} have difficulty maintaining employment.

Transsexual people must decide whether to transition on-the-job, or to find a new job <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> their social transition. Other stresses that transsexual people face in the workplace are being fearful of coworkers negatively responding to their transition, and losing job experience under a previous name—even deciding which rest room to use can prove challenging.

E trains stop on the express tracks at all times except late nights, <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> local stops along the Queens Boulevard Line.

25|$|Banks {{can create}} new money <b>when</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> a loan. New loans {{throughout}} {{the banking system}} generate new deposits elsewhere in the system. The money supply is usually increased by the act of lending, and reduced when loans are repaid faster than new ones are generated. In the United Kingdom between 1997 and 2007, {{there was an increase}} in the money supply, largely caused by much more bank lending, which served to push up property prices and increase private debt. The amount of money in the economy as measured by M4 in the UK went from £750 billion to £1700 billion between 1997 and 2007, much of the increase caused by bank lending. If all the banks increase their lending together, then they can expect new deposits to return to them and the amount of money in the economy will increase. Excessive or risky lending can cause borrowers to default, the banks then become more cautious, so there is less lending and therefore less money so that the economy can go from boom to bust as happened in the UK and many other Western economies after 2007.|$|E

With this new Hook lacking in bravery, Henry has {{to take care of}} Blackbeard himself, before telling Hook that he must help him rescue his mother, Emma, from the tower. Henry and Hook sail to the tower and proceed to knock out the dark guard on duty. When Henry reaches Emma at the top, he is surprised to find that she has been able to keep her memories as part of a cruel curse. As the trio escape on the ship, Emma, while getting to know Hook, explains that the guard they knocked out was none other than Lily, who has the ability to transform into a dragon. Emma and Hook are able to shoot her down into the ocean with a cannon before she attacks. <b>When</b> <b>they</b> <b>make</b> a pit stop at a village, the three are caught by Snow and Charming, whom Lily had informed of their location.
