5|$|Since October 2003 the {{employment}} of domestic workers has been subject to the unpopular Employees' Retraining Levy, totalling HK$9,600 for a two-year contract. It has not been applied since 16 July 2008, and has since been abolished. Whether foreign <b>workers</b> <b>should</b> be able to apply for Hong Kong residency {{is the subject of}} debate, and a high-profile court battle for residency by a foreign worker failed.|$|E
5|$|Speer {{placed his}} {{department}} {{at the disposal of}} the Wehrmacht. When Hitler remonstrated, and said it was not for Speer to decide how his <b>workers</b> <b>should</b> be used, Speer simply ignored him. Among Speer's innovations were quick-reaction squads to construct roads or clear away debris; before long, these units would be used to clear bomb sites. As the war progressed, initially to great German success, Speer continued preliminary work on the Berlin and Nürnberg plans. Speer also oversaw the construction of buildings for the Wehrmacht and Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the township, {{there were a number}} of temporary camps established for construction workers. It was initially intended that the construction <b>workers</b> <b>should</b> live off-site, but the poor condition of the roads and a shortage of accommodations in the area made commuting long and difficult, and in turn made it difficult to find and retain workers. Construction workers therefore came to be housed in large hutment and trailer camps. The largest, the trailer camp at Gamble Valley, had four thousand units. Another, at Happy Valley, held 15,000 people. The population of the construction camps declined as the construction effort tapered off, but they continued to be occupied in 1946.|$|E

Construction workers therefore came to be housed in large hutment and trailer camps. The J. A. Jones camp for K-25 workers, known as Happy Valley, held 15,000 people. This required 8 dormitories, 17 barracks, 1,590 hutments, 1,153 trailers and 100 Victory Houses. A pumping station was built to supply drinking water from the Clinch River, along with a water treatment plant. Amenities included a school, eight cafeterias, a bakery, theater, three recreation halls, a warehouse and a cold storage plant. Ford, Bacon & Davis established a smaller camp for 2,100 people. Responsibility for the camps was transferred to the Roane-Anderson Company on 25 January 1946, and the school was transferred to district control in March 1946.|$|E

25|$|The American Federation of Labor, {{meeting in}} St Louis in December 1888, set 1 May 1890 {{as the day}} that American <b>workers</b> <b>should</b> work no more than eight hours.

25|$|I {{believe that}} 95 {{percent of us}} agree that the <b>workers</b> <b>should</b> control the industries. Nearly all of us agree on that but very strenuously {{disagree}} on the method.

25|$|Colonies of Polybia sericea are polygynous, and {{generally}} {{have more than}} one queen. Typically, the number of queens in a colony is three or four. This results in a lower degree of relatedness among workers, and it has been questioned why <b>workers</b> <b>should</b> care for offspring that are related to them by less than half. Although this is not fully understood, {{it has been suggested that}} the advantages of group living compensate for the low degree of relatedness among workers, so workers will still care for offspring.|$|E
25|$|If the {{respiratory}} {{system is the}} main way of receipt of harmful substances in the body, and if the use of other means of protection does not allow to reduce the impact to an acceptable value, employee must use respirators. They should be selected taking into account their effectiveness (it depends on the respirator type); masks should be chosen for employees personally; and <b>workers</b> <b>should</b> be learned, and trained - in accordance with legal requirements. This {{reduces the risk of}} occupational diseases as much as possible.|$|E
50|$|Methods-Time Measurement (MTM) is a {{predetermined}} motion time {{system that is}} used primarily in industrial settings to analyze the methods used to perform any manual operation or task and, {{as a product of}} that analysis, set the standard time in which a <b>worker</b> <b>should</b> complete that task.|$|R
50|$|The {{working time}} {{can also be}} divided in actual working time (working hours, during which the <b>worker</b> <b>should</b> {{immediately}} fulfill its obligations) and being on disposal (working hours will be paid in reduced amount. Should the employee be called to perform actual work, this time is paid as overtime).|$|R
50|$|The social <b>worker</b> <b>should</b> be {{constantly}} reflexive, work {{to raise the}} consciousness, empower, and understand the lived subjective realities of individuals living in a fast-paced world, where fear and insecurity constantly subjugate the individual from the collective whole, perpetuating the dominant forces, while silencing the oppressed (Sakamoto and Pitner, 2005).|$|R
25|$|The risk {{of hearing}} damage {{also depends on}} the {{exposure}} time. The higher the volume, the faster hearing loss occurs. According to OSHA work safety guidelines, <b>workers</b> <b>should</b> be exposed to 90dBA noise for a maximum of 8 hours to avoid hearing loss. An increase to just 95dBA cuts the safe exposure to only 4 hours. But {{there seems to be}} no specific consensus on the level of exposure. NIOSH has an 8-hour recommended exposure limit set to 85dBA. Additionally, an increase to 93dBA instead of 95dBA halves the safe exposure time to 4 hours.|$|E
25|$|Obviously {{this system}} is not viable in a {{capitalist}} society, since once the owners automate their factories, they just sack all their workers without pay and let them starve while the machines do all the work, filling their own pockets with gold from the profit. This is unjust {{and should not be}} tolerated. The boss who builds a machine that replaces one hundred <b>workers</b> <b>should</b> continue to pay these workers who now have nothing to do. Thus the machine should allow them to enter and benefit from the age of leisure.|$|E
25|$|When the {{employers}} {{were asked about}} the kafala system, 55.8% wanted the system to change. The {{reason for this is}} that {{the employers}} felt that the burden was too high on them. In fact the figure increased to 65% when the employers were informed of the obligation to reimburse the recruitment fees in case of an early termination of contract by the migrant workers. A large amount of the employers even felt that the migrant <b>workers</b> <b>should</b> not be included in the Lebanese labour code, out of fear of the expansion of these rights to other foreigners like the Syrian or Palestinian refugees.|$|E
50|$|The Internal Revenue Code {{does not}} contain any {{definition}} or rules dealing {{with the issue of}} when a <b>worker</b> <b>should</b> be characterized for tax purposes as an employee, rather than as an independent contractor. The tax treatment depends on the application of (20) factors provided by common law, which varies by state.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} to the previously discussed technical approaches, a set of management policies can also relax the issue. As an example, no new <b>worker</b> <b>should</b> be added {{unless there is a}} demand for it. The demand for a new worker can be determined when the resource utilization for each zone is above a given threshold.|$|R
5000|$|Having {{to travel}} {{substantial}} distances every month adds substantial travel costs and more {{strain on the}} substantial caseload social workers have. The recommended number of cases that a <b>worker</b> <b>should</b> serve according to the Child Welfare League of America (CWLA) is at most 12-15 children while some agencies already have caseloads that may exceed 40 cases per worker.|$|R
25|$|From 1911 the {{government}} required {{the company to}} establish a fund which would aid the <b>workers</b> <b>should</b> the company go bankrupt. This was introduced after several large industrial companies had collapsed {{in the past decade}} and large costs had befallen the state. Just as the first expansion was competed, Sydvaranger decided that it needed to further expand its export capacity to 650,000 tonnes. Financing was secured through issuing new shares worth NOK3million. Investments included a new steam shovel, three steam cranes, three locomotives, a new briquetting plant; the work was completed in 1913. In 1913 the company had 1,150 employees.|$|E
25|$|Colonies of P. gallicus {{have one}} queen that mates and {{produces}} offspring. All females, both workers and queens, {{are capable of}} producing male offspring, and have a genetic incentive to do so; mother-to-son relatedness is 1/2, while the relatedness of a worker to her brothers is 1/4. If the queen has only been mated once, then worker's relatedness to the male offspring of other workers is 3/8, meaning <b>workers</b> <b>should</b> favor male production by themselves and their sisters over production by the queen. However, in {{the case that the}} queen mates more than once, workers are actually more related to their brothers than compared to the offspring of other workers (a mixture of full and half sisters).|$|E
25|$|Outdoor {{workers are}} at risk of Lyme disease if they work at sites with {{infected}} ticks. In 2010, the highest number of confirmed Lyme disease cases were reported from New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Minnesota, Maryland, Virginia, New Hampshire, Delaware, and Maine. U.S. workers in the northeastern and north-central States are at highest risk of exposure to infected ticks. Ticks may also transmit other tick-borne diseases to workers in these and other regions of the country. Worksites with woods, bushes, high grass, or leaf litter are likely to have more ticks. Outdoor <b>workers</b> <b>should</b> be extra careful to protect themselves in the late spring and summer when young ticks are most active.|$|E
