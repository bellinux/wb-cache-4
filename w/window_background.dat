The cell is adapted {{so as to}} enhance the gas-detection performance and, simultaneously, to reduce the cell size. The cell design provides an efficient cancellation of the <b>window</b> <b>background</b> (a parasite response due to absorption of laser beam in the cell windows) and acoustic isolation from the environment for an acoustic resonance of the cell. The useful photoacoustic response from a detected gas, <b>window</b> <b>background</b> and noise are analyzed in demonstration experiments as functions of the modulation frequency for a prototype cell with the internal volume ~ 0. 5 cm^ 3.

40|$|A new {{conducting}} composite {{flexible material}} prepared from cellulose acetate (CA) polymer and graphite {{has been developed}} and used for the fabrication of electrodes, which were then characterized by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to provide information concerning the morphology of the composite electrode surface. The potential <b>window,</b> <b>background</b> currents and capacitance were evaluated by cyclic voltammetry in the pH range from 4. 6 to 8. 2. The voltammetry of model electroactive species demonstrates a close to reversible electrochemical behaviour, under linear diffusion control. The electroactive area of the composite electrodes increases after appropriate electrode polishing and electrochemical pre-treatment. The electrodes were used as substrate for the electropolymerisation of the phenazine dye neutral red, for future use as redox mediator in electrochemical biosensors. The composite electrodes were also successfully used for the amperometric detection of ascorbate at 0. 0 V vs. SCE, and applied to the measurement of ascorbate in Vitamin C tablets; the sensor exhibits high sensitivity and a low detection limit of 7. 7 [mu]M.

30|$|Classical {{background}} removal [1] {{can be used}} {{as another}} imaging method. Actually, it is not only a simple method, but also it is enough to train the human brain when it is considered properly. However, there is a problem at this point, if sliding background removal is applied to the data without considering whether a DWS is active or not, the target data estimate is corrupted and complex scenes may appear in GPR images. In this case, interpretation of GPR B-scan data by the operator may become impossible. In this study, a solution is proposed for this problem. The proposed method uses fuzzy weighted sliding <b>window</b> <b>background</b> signal calculation, background removal, and calculation of target energy functions. Creation of a DWS activation point is performed through a novel detection test statistic (DTS) to mark the target region without any remarkable distortion in the GPR image. Background update is stopped if there is any detected target. The detection problem is addressed in Section 2, details of the proposed method are presented in Section 3, experimental results are given in Section 4, and the conclusions are drawn in Section 5.|$|E
40|$|The {{implantation}} <b>window.</b> <b>Background.</b> Embryo implantation is {{a complex}} event involving apposition followed by adhesion of the blastocyst to the maternal endometrium, and finally invasion of this endometrium. Though implantation could occur in any human tissue, the endometrium is the only tissue where embryo implantation cannot occur except during a restricted period called the implantation window. During this window, the endometrium is highly receptive to the embryo. Material and methods. We reviewed the literature concerning the different factors involved in improved endometrial receptivity and implantation. Results. Maternal - embryo crosstalk is favored by the implantation window. Endometrial receptivity results from the acquisition of ligands or receptors facilitating apposition, then adhesion of the embryo, or {{from the loss of}} components preventing it. The molecular basis of the implantation window remains to be defined. Conclusion. Despite progress in assisted reproduction technologies, the lack of control of implantation remains a major obstacle to successful pregnancy. It is of prime importance to determine the characteristic features of a receptive endometrium and, among the many markers proposed by in vitro studies, to analyze in humans those demonstrated by knock-out experiments to {{play a crucial role in}} mice.

40|$|Optoacoustic {{spectroscopy}} is {{a relatively}} old technique first described by Alexander Graham Bell in 1881. However, over the intervening years, little use {{was made of the}} technique due to its low sensitivity. This was due to low source intensities of available infrared light sources which limited the optoacoustic signal strength. With the advent of laser infrared light sources in the 1960 's, there has been a resurgence of interest in optoacoustics. No longer is low source intensity a major limitation to successful optoacoustic spectroscopy. Although adequate infrared light sources are available, the large <b>window</b> <b>background</b> signal observed in all optoacoustic systems has been the major limitation in extending trace gas detection limits to the ppb or sub-ppb level. Similarly, there has been little demonstration of the use of the optoacoustic technique in environments where mixtures of gases are present which have severe spectral overlap. This work will discuss a new windowless cell design that largely eliminates the signal background problem ubiquitous to all presently available optoacoustic cells. New methodologies will be discussed that allow analyses of mixtures to be performed even in cases where spectral overlap is severe. Limitations to both the windowless cell and the various multicomponent analysis strategies are discussed...|$|E

40|$|A {{resonant}} photoacoustic cell {{capable of}} detecting {{the traces of}} gases at an amplitude-modulation regime is represented. The cell is designed so as to minimize the <b>window</b> <b>background</b> for the cell operation at a selected acoustic resonance. A compact prototype cell (the volume of acoustic cavity of ~ 0. 2 cm^ 3, total cell weight of 3. 5 g) adapted to the narrow diffraction-limited beam of near-infrared laser is produced and examined experimentally. The noise-associated measurement error and laser-initiated signals are studied as functions of modulation frequency. The background signal and useful response to light absorption by the gas are analyzed in measurements of absorption for ammonia traces in nitrogen flow {{with the help of}} a pigtailed DFB laser diode operated near a wavelength of 1. 53 um. The performance of absorption detection and gas-leak sensing for the prototype operated at the second longitudinal acoustic resonance (the resonance frequency of ~ 4. 38 kHz, Q-factor of ~ 13. 9) is estimated. The noise-equivalent absorption normalized to laser-beam power and detection bandwidth is ~ 1. 44 x 10 ^{- 9 } cm^{- 1 } W Hz^{- 1 / 2 }. The amplitude of the window-background signal is equivalent to an absorption coefficient of ~ 2. 82 x 10 ^{- 7 } cm^{- 1 }.
