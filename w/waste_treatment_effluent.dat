The Arroyo Colorado River is the principal source of fresh water inflow to the Southern Laguna Madre, an economically and ecologically important resource for the Lower Rio Grande Valley region of Texas. The Arroyo Colorado serves as a principal drainage system for municipal <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>effluent</b> (from the cities of Harlingen and McAllen, Texas), agricultural production runoff, and storm water runoff from the Lower Rio Grande Valley. The lower reaches of the Arroyo Colorado have historically failed to meet their use under subsection 303 (b) of the US-Clean Water Act (CWA) due to fecal coliform bacteria and low dissolved oxygen. Sections of the Arroyo Colorado are listed in the 1998 CWA 303 (d) report of non-compliant water bodies and are targeted for rehabilitation under the Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) program. In some rivers, sediment oxygen demand (SOD) accounts for as much as 50 % of the total oxygen depletion, making SOD a critical element in water quality modeling studies. SOD is the rate of oxygen consumption, biologically or chemically, on or in the sediment {{at the bottom of a}} water body. SOD is an integral part of assessing the quality of water in a system. This study attempts to address SOD in the Arroyo Colorado to aid in the understanding of oxygen dynamics in this system...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} the second year of investigative and evaluative work of the University of Hawaii's Sea Grant Program project, "Quality of Coastal Waters" The general objectives of this multidisciplinary project are to identify, develop, and evaluate the critical physical, biological, and rational parameters needed in formulating effective policies, institutions, and systems for protecting the quality of coastal waters in Hawaii. To this end, the attainment of eight specific objectives is assigned to faculty specialists participating in the 14 activities which comprise the Project. These specialists also assist the Principal Investigator in planning the work and in interpreting the results. Research activities for the project year consisted principally of field and laboratory studies of coastal waters initiated in the first project year but with increased emphasis on biota and sediment. Assistance was rendered to the State Department of Health in the revision and updating of the State Water Quality Standards. Kahana Bay was selected for study as a coastal water area under the influence of relatively undeveloped land. Land contribution of nutrients to the bay via Kahana Stream and all nonpoint routes was found to be small despite the perennial nature of the surface and subsurface discharges. However, the nitrogen and phosphorus levels measured for Kahana Bay waters and in the contiguous open ocean water exceeded the levels allowed under its state Class AA water classification. Coliform organism concentrations met the Class A rather than Class AA standards. Thus, the Kahana Bay water quality tends to satisfy the Class A standard rather than the Class AA standard. Heavy metals, especially lead, copper, zinc, chromium, and nickel, appeared consistently and within a range of a few to a few hundred ppm in the bay sediments, stream sediments, and watershed soils. The ubiquitous nature of their presence is related to the parent rocks from which the soils and sediment are derived. However, mercury and cadmium were only occasionally detected in the sediments and when detected, occurred at only within a range of a fraction of to a few parts per million. DDT was detected in the range of a few parts per trillion in the Kahana Bay sediment together with only periodically detected and very low levels of dieldrin, DDE, a and y chlordane. In the Kahana Bay water both heavy metals and DDT were detected but only at levels similar to open ocean water, i. e., a fraction of, or a few parts per billion for the heavy metals, and only a few parts per trillion for DDT. The project's approach to revealing the effects of urban land development is selection of single predominant type of urbanization of land to reveal the cause-effect relation. Recreational use of coastal land and water in and domestic urban use of water and the abutting land in Hawaii Kai Marina and east Maunalua Bay furnish such situations. Domestic sewage is collected and removed from the areas. Investigative results for the Hawaii Kai area and Maunalua Bay showed a general trend to improvement in water quality from the marina to the near-ocean bay waters. Nitrogen levels in the bay and only the near-ocean station were within the Class A state standard by which the water bodies are classified but phosphorus levels exceeded the standard elsewhere. All heavy metals were consistently present in the coastal sediments in the parts per million level. The levels of the ubiquitous pesticides analyzed, DDT, dieldrin, and PCP, (the latter is used primarily for termite control in house construction), were at least one order of magnitude higher than in the Kahana Bay sediments, thus reflecting intensive urban activities associated with a relatively new and growing residential development. In the Hawaii Kai Marina and coastal waters, heavy metals were detected in the usual minimal parts per billion level as in open ocean water, and DDT, dieldrin and PCP were in the usual parts per trillion range. A turbid water plume in Maunalua Bay was occasionally identified and apparently was related to currents and roiling bottom sediments rather than any liquid discharge. A biota study of the bay waters was completed and detailed. Coastal water quality data obtained for the Mamala Bay waters off in support of a conjunctive study by Chave for the Corps of Engineers and coliform monitoring by the Department of Health are reported. in general the data satisfied state requirements for Class A waters except for phosphorus. Coral abundance was generally less toward Diamond Head than toward Ala Wai Canal. which is the only major drainage canal intercepting the surface runoff from the valleys and discharging into coastal waters. From the findings, there is little evidence which would attribute any specific water quality effect solely to the presence of intense recreational activity at Sandy Beach represents a rather complex situation and departs from the project approach: the open ocean coast beach being popular, the land use changing from rural and undeveloped to residential urban development, and above all, the coastal water receiving treated domestic effluent. Shoreline water quality data were obtained to complement the studies undertaken by the consulting firm of Sunn, Low, Tom, and Hara, and the routine monitoring by the State Health Department. Results for the project area showed clear shoreline water similar to but with higher nutrients than Kahana Bay water and the state Class A standard Levels. However, the study by the consulting firm of the offshore condition adjacent to the Hawaii Kai sewer outfall showed that there is little significant effect to the coastal water and benthos from the discharge of treated wastewater off Sandy Beach. A baseline survey of benthic biota, particularly coral and micromollusc abundance and diversity, and fish was performed for Kailua Bay, the proposed Mokapu outfall site, and the existing Kailua sewer outfall. While the greatest abundance and species diversity of the fish were not near the outfall, the highest standing crop of micromolluscs is near the outfall. The occurrence of micromolluscs is comparable with the patterns in other areas of similar depth and substrate. Nonpoint discharge studies of sugarcane production and milling wastes were continued but at a reduced scale on Kauai. Observations of mill waste discharge and coastal water, sediments, and biota were made {{both before and after the}} 90 -year old Kilauea Sugar Company closed down its operations in north Kauai in 1971. Untreated mill wastes were found to be the major contributing factor to the presence of coliforms, sediments, trash, and bagasse. The effect was largely an extensive visible plume in the coastal waters and debris in both the water and on the beach. Sediments, rather than water, harbored most of the nutrients, heavy metals, and pesticides in the ocean. DDT, although not used by the sugarcane industry, was present in small amounts in all wastes and sediments. Herbicides used in sugarcane culture did not appear in coastal waters. A striking aesthetic improvement of the coastal water and the beach quickly followed the cessation of mill waste discharge. Coastal water qualities continued to improve: phosphorus decreased to better than Class AA standards, DDT and PCP were detectable only at parts per trillion level. The rapid improvement is attributed to both the cessation of mill waste discharge and the heavy sea. Beach and ocean sediments continue to harbor about the same level of heavy metals but contain a much decreased amount of nutrients. Fish have reappeared rapidly since 1973. No apparent changes in micromolluscs have been observed since the cessation of mill operation. Tentative conclusions of the continued Kilauea investigative studies are: no evidence of eutrophication in coastal water, adverse effects of discharge mostly transitory, and epibenthic communities more influenced by waves, currents, and coastal topography than by mill waste discharge. Studies were continued in south Kauai to assess the effect of changed operation practices by the McBryde Sugar Company subsequent to an EPA survey of coastal waters of the area in 1968. Company practices demonstrate that it is possibze to operate milzing operations without discharge to the ocean, and to prevent irrigation tailwater overflows except flooding due to intense rainfall. At the time of reporting, the coastal waters of Wahiawa Bay showed an anomalously high nitrogen content while no pesticide residues were found in the offshore water except for the one to two parts per trillion DDT which seems to be present everywhere. Evaluative summaries were detailed for several key quality parameters in water and sediment. Heavy metals were ubiquitous and in parts per million range in coastal sediment in Hawaii. This suggests that if standards for the level of heavy metals in dredge spoil were to be set, care should be taken not to fix unrealistic levels that cannot possibly be attained. In the coastal waters, heavy metals also occur but only in the parts per billion range, a level quite comparable to the level in ocean water. Conjunctive studies of mercury uptake in an aquatic food chain from the water and sediment were continued and detailed. Of the insecticides, the presence of DDT in sediments is ubiquitous. In Maunalua Bay and Hawaii Kai sediments, dieldrin, and a and y chlordane are found frequently and with highest concentration in the Low parts per billion range. Their occurrence may be attributed to prior and current continous use of these chemicals in the abutting land area and the poor sediment circulation within the Hawaii Kai Marina. In coastal waters insecticides were generally undetectable or at only a few parts per trillion. PCP, like DDT, seems to occur ubiquitously. Herbicide residues in West Loch of Pearl Harbor and Kaiaka Bay were studied. Atrazine and ametryne do not appear to be a problem, however, because of its persistence in soils, diuron can be found in coastal sediments because eroded agricultural soils are transported with storm runoff. Kahana Bay water contains about the lowest amounts of nutrients in coastal waters. The state standards for nitrogen and phosphorus were exceeded in all areas except for Kilauea, in the case of nitrogen, and McBryde, in the case of phosphorus. The use of mircomolluscs as an indicator organism was reported with a differentiation noted in species between coastal areas affected primarily by silting compared to areas affected primarily by nutrient input. In the former situation Bittium zebrum becomes the major fauna component and standing crops and diversity values are conspicuously depressed. In the latter case, the community changes towards dominance by suspension feeding forms which depend on primary productivity of the water columns. Also associated strongly with silted reef flats is Obtortio pupoides. The responses of an ecosystem to land-generated effects are changes in structure from a grazing herbivore environment with associated frondose algae to either a rubble associated ecosystem with few species or to a eutrophic state with many suspension feeders and Low diversity. The principal changes in institutional arrangements noted in the project year are those resulting from the passage of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments PL 92 - 500. The effects of this legislation will be far-reaching and result in changes which include: new discharge permit requirements, reporting of operating and monitoring results for wastewater treatment facilities, a minimum requirement level of secondary treatment for municipal wastewaters, and industrial <b>waste</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>effluent</b> guidelines. The full impact of these and other changes is not yet apparent although some delays have incurred in regulatory actions and attempts to implement legislation.

A 2006 study found detectable concentrations of 28 pharmaceutical compounds in sewage <b>treatment</b> plant <b>effluents,</b> surface water, and sediment. The therapeutic classes included antibiotics, analgesics and anti-inflammatories, lipid regulators, beta-blockers, anti-convulsant, and steroid hormones.

40|$|The {{contamination}} of surface waters with organic micropollutants {{is a well}} known problem and increased over the last decades. One reason for their release and consequently their detection in surface waters is their incomplete degradation and therefore insufficient removal during conventional <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> processes. To overcome this problem advanced oxidation processes have been proposed as an additional treatment step, since the formation of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals helps to degrade those substances. This study was therefore designed to investigate the toxicological properties (cytotoxic, genotoxic, mutagenic and estrogenic) of several substances before and after ozonation or UV/H 2 O 2 <b>treatment</b> in either <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> plant <b>effluents</b> or HPLC-water using toxicological in vitro methods. These methods are able to identify biological effects of the whole water sample thus the entire complexity of chemicals. In addition cellular based methods will give an overview on possible induction mechanisms which {{will lead to a}} manifestation of effects on the organ or even organism level. In the case of Terbutryn its genotoxicity before treatment was first increased at low ozone dosages (36, 100, and 195 μg/L) but was removed at the highest ozone dosage (800 μg). Similar results have been shown for TPP. Genotoxic effects were only seen before ozonation, but after 60 minutes of ozonation these effects were removed. The ozonation of Triclosan resulted {{in the formation of the}} by-product 2, 4 -Dichlorophenol. Both substances did not exhibit cytotoxic effects up to a maximum tested concentration of 100 μg/L. Genotoxic effects were only seen for Triclosan starting at a concentration of 10 μg/L. Thus a less genotoxic by-product has been formed during ozonation. The estrogenicity tests showed that HPLC-water containing Bisphenol A did no longer have estrogenic effects after UV/H 2 O 2 treatment whereas neither the ozonation nor the UV/H 2 O 2 treatment of Ethinylestradiol for 60 minutes resulted in a 28 complete loss of estrogenic activity. The musk fragrance HHCB in contrast did not show estrogenic effects, neither before nor after ozonation. For the two beta blockers (Atenolol and Metoprolol), the antibiotics Sulfamethoxazole and Ofloxacin as well as the musk fragrance AHTN neither before nor after ozonation or UV/H 2 O 2 oxidation cytotoxic effects were detected. The ozonation of Irgaol 1051 did also not lead to cyto- or genotoxic effects. The results of the oxidation experiments with Bisphenol A, Ciprofloxacin and HHCB demonstrated that formed oxidation by-products differ in regard to toxicity depending on treatment method and water matrix. Cytotoxic effects for all three substances were only detected in HPLC-water after 60 minutes of UV/H 2 O 2 but not in <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> plant <b>effluent.</b> In addition no toxicity was detected after the same time of oxidation using ozone. The tested concentrations of TCPP as well as TCEP were not toxic before oxidative treatment. However cytotoxic effects were detected after UV/H 2 O 2 treatment whereas the ozonation did not induce cytotoxicity. In general it can be concluded that ozonation as well as UV/H 2 O 2 oxidation are two useful methods for the removal of the here tested substances from the <b>effluents</b> of <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> plants in regard to their degradation and to prevent the formation of toxic oxidation by-products considering the used test methods (MTT Test, PAN I, Alkaline Comet Assay, Ames Test, and ER Calux). However a generalized statement about micropollutants their removal and toxicity is not possible, and needs to be established on a case by case basis since operating conditions as well as the matrix composition vary over time. The successful use of toxicological in vitro methods for the detection of biological effects of <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> plant <b>effluents</b> in combination with advanced oxidation processes is confirmed by other studies, e. g. a study performed by the Eawag at the <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> plant in Regensdorf or the PILLS project...|$|R

The data collected during this study do not provide strong evidence that the high concentrations of poultry houses and the associated land application of litter are contributing to a degradation of the water quality in the streams that were monitored.

40|$|As new {{environmental}} management policies for watersheds are implemented, {{there has been}} a growing interest for new monitoring alternatives. Traditionally grab sampling has been the method of choice for monitoring purposes, but may not be adequate or economically viable, to meet the requirements of the new policies. Passive samplers for monitoring of aquatic pollutants have been described in the literature for almost three decades, but they are only beginning to gain acceptance outside the scientific research community. The potential advantages of passive samplers over other sampling and measurement strategies include the ability to integrate pollutant levels over extended sampling periods (up to several weeks), as well as inherent speciation capabilities, allowing for critical in situ speciation of metals. Passive samplers are relatively low-cost and do not require secure locations or additional infrastructure, making them ideal devices for certain monitoring tasks. The research presented in this thesis aims at further developing passive sampling for aquatic monitoring.

40|$|Aquatic organisms from {{freshwater}} ecosystems {{impacted by}} <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> plant (WWTP) <b>effluents</b> are constantly exposed to constant concentrations of pharmaceuticals, endocrine disruptors and related compounds, among other anthropogenic contaminants. Macroinvertebrates inhabiting freshwater ecosystems {{might be useful}} bioindicators of exposure to contaminants, since their lives are long enough to bioaccumulate, {{but at the same}} time may integrate short-term changes in the environment. However, studies about potential bioaccumulation of emerging contaminants in these organisms are very scarce.

In addition, bioaccumulation of these contaminants in three macroinvertebrate taxa inhabiting a <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> plant -impacted river was evaluated. The method for the simultaneous extraction of both families of compounds is based on sonication, purification via removal of phospholipids, and analysis by ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled to a mass spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS) in tandem. Recoveries for pharmaceuticals were 34 - 125 %, and for endocrine disruptors were 48 - 117 %. Method detection limits (MDLs) for EDCs were in the range of 0. 080 - 2. 4 ng g- 1, and for pharmaceuticals, 0. 060 - 4. 3 ng g- 1. These pollutants were detected in water samples taken downstream the <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> plant <b>effluent</b> at concentrations up to 572 ng L- 1. Two non-esteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diclofenac and ibuprofen, and four endocrine disruptors - estrone, bisphenol A, TBEP, and nonylphenol - were detected in at least one macroinvertebrate taxa in concentrations up to 183 ng g- 1 (dry weight).

40|$|Up till now, the {{diclofenac}} (DCF) {{transformation into}} its nitrogen-derivatives, N-nitroso-DCF (NO-DCF) and 5 -nitro-DCF (NO 2 -DCF), has been mainly investigated in <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> plant under nitrification or denitrification processes. This work reports, {{for the first}} time, an additional DCF microbial mediated nitrosation pathway of DCF in soil under strictly anoxic conditions probably involving codenitrification processes and fungal activities. This transformation pathway was investigated by using field observations data at a soil aquifer system (Katari watershed, Bolivia) and by carrying out soil slurry batch experiments. It was also observed for diphenylamine (DPA). Field measurements revealed the occurrence of NO-DCF, NO 2 -DCF and NO-DPA in groundwater samples at concentration levels in the 6 - 68 s/L range. These concentration levels are more significant than those previously reported in <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> plant <b>effluents</b> taking into account dilution processes in soil. Interestingly, the p-benzoquinone imine of 5 -OH-DCF was also found to be rather stable in surface water. In laboratory batch experiments under strictly anoxic conditions, the transformation of DCF and DPA into their corresponding N-nitroso derivatives was well correlated to denitrification processes. It was also observed that NO-DCF evolved into NO 2 -DCF while NO-DPA was stable. In vitro experiments showed that the Fisher-Hepp rearrangement could not account for NO 2 -DCF formation. One possible mechanism might be that NO-DCF underwent spontaneous NO loss to give the resulting intermediates diphenylaminyl radical or nitrenium cation which might evolve into NO 2 -DCF in presence of NO 2 radical or nitrite ion, respectively...|$|R

40|$|A whole stream {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the nutrient retention capacity of Fosso Bagnatore, a third order stream in the Mediterranean region. Nitrogen (NH 4 -N, NO 3 -N) and phosphorus (PO 4 -P) retentions were assessed using controlled nutrient addition experiments. The experimental reaches were selected with reference to a <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> plant <b>effluent</b> and characterized from a physical, hydraulic, chemical and biological standpoint on each nutrient addition date. Nutrient retention was thus compared between control and impacted reaches to detect the possible effluent effects on the stream retention capacity. The impacted reach showed on average a higher concentration of NH 4 -N, NO 2 -N, DOC, a larger standing crop of benthic organic matter, lower gross primary production and higher respiration rate. Nutrient retention of NH 4 -N and PO 4 -P were negatively correlated with discharge but differences between reaches were significant only for PO 4 -P retention, being higher in the impacted reach. No differences were observed for NO 3 -N retention. We conclude that discharge is the main factor influencing nutrient retention of Fosso Bagnatore, but. In summer months, at lower discharge levels, nutrient retention is also influenced by nutrient background concentrations and microbial activity associated with the benthic organic matter. JRC.

40|$|In {{intermittent}} rivers, characterised by {{a specific}} hydrological behaviour, sediment-water column interactions may influence water quality during low flows. The main {{objective of this}} work {{was to assess the}} extent of anthropogenic pollution (organotins, faecal indicator bacteria and nutrients) in the river sediment of an intermittent river {{and its impact on the}} downstream water bodies: The Vene River, main tributary of the Thau lagoon. We first investigated anthropogenic pollution from water and sediment samples collected in situ along the river course (1. 5 km); then, during laboratory experiments, we assessed the survival of faecal bacteria and quantified the degradation rates of organotins on the same sediments. The results indicate the presence of anthropogenic pollution all along the study reach. The <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> plant <b>effluent</b> is a direct pollution input source for anthropogenic pollution. The sediment data points to an urban drainage ditch as a secondary point pollution source while the organotins data highlights the presence of other diffuse sources, specific to this substance. The results of the laboratory experiments show that both faecal bacteria and organotins may persist in the river sediments for up to two months in summer and even longer in winter. This indicates that sediments may, under favourable conditions, become important pollutant stores which may later be released and transported to the Thau lagoon during floods...|$|R
40|$|The {{concern about}} the impacts of {{endocrine}} disrupting compounds (EDCs) in the environment has increased recently with their high occurrence in surface waters and sex changes in various aquatic organisms. EDCs include ubiquitously used pharmaceuticals and personal care products, such as soap, detergents, contraceptives, and other medicines, which are released constantly into the environment, in <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> plant <b>effluent.</b> Though toxicological effects of these individual, EDCs have been studied, knowledge on how these chemicals interact together in the environment is very limited. The objective of this project is to study the multi-residue effect of EDCs using a chemi-luminescent yeast assay with Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The dose response curve for 17 β-Estradiol (E 2, a natural hormone) ranging from 10 pM to 500 nM alone with varying concentrations of the Bisphenol A (BPA, a monomer used in many chemical products) EC 50 was used at concentrations of 3. 43 E- 7 M, 3. 43 E- 6 M, and 3. 43 E- 5 M. Results indicate reduced estrogenic activity multiple combinations of E 2 and BPA. The EC 50 for all the experimental treatments {{was found to be}} more estrogenic than the individual BPA EC 50.

40|$|We {{studied the}} effects of a <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> plant on organic matter {{dynamics}} in Fosso Bagnatore, a Mediterranean stream near Rome (Italy). Concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and seston, along with the standing crops of coarse benthic organic matter and fine benthic organic matter, were monitored monthly during 2002 in two reaches situated upstream and downstream of a <b>waste</b> water <b>treatment</b> plant <b>effluent.</b> Additionally, we examined two stream functional characteristics: whole stream metabolism, which was measured from diel changes in oxygen concentrations, and nutrient removal, which was studied by experimental additions of NH 4 -N, NO 3 -N and PO 4 -P. The possible influence of WWTP organic matter alterations on ecosystem functioning was addressed by measuring epilithon characteristics (standing crop, C:N:P ratios and chlorophyll a content). The WWTP effluent caused an increase (several-fold) of DOC and seston concentrations, and FBOM standing crop, moreover it modified their temporal variation. Downstream of the wastewater treatment plant we detected an higher heterotrophic microbial biomass and a correspondent higher community respiration. The uptake of NH 4 -N, NO 3 -N and PO 4 -P was highly variable probably as consequence of the high variability of the compartments involved (e. g. DOC, FBOM, community respiration). We showed that WWTP effluent altered the organic matter dynamics of this Mediterranean-type headwater stream and that these effects were reflected in its ecosystem functioning. Because of the linkage of headwaters to downstream ecosystems and due to their significant role in landscape and catchment processes, the alterations of organic matter dynamics that we detected at a local scale may have important consequences on a broader scale.
