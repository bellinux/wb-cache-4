25|$|The Globe {{has a long}} {{tradition}} of being a progressive institution, and especially on social issues. We are pro-choice; we're against the death penalty; we're for gay rights. But if people read us carefully, they will find that on a whole series of other issues, we are not knee-jerk. We're for charter schools; we're for any number of business-backed tax breaks. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> lot more nuanced and subtle than that liberal stereotype does justice to.|$|E
25|$|The song Hop Hop has {{political}} tones. It {{describes how}} the states exploit the citizens for their own purposes, how today's political systems are good for nothing, since {{the world is full}} of violence, war, human rights are many times oppressed, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> subject to global warming and governments do little to save us. Tarkan explained in the interview that the song examines these problems and encourages people to unite, no matter what color our skin is or what religion we follow.|$|E
25|$|We're all {{involved}} in this: our whole {{way of life}} is structured around the burning of fossil fuels. I find it sobering to think that while I've been travelling the world, trying to record the complexity and beauty of our planet, that I too have been making my own contribution to global warming. As I recognised when I presented Life on Earth all those years ago, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> flexible and innovative species and we have the capacity to adapt and modify our behaviour. Now we most certainly have to do so if we're to deal with climate change. It's the biggest challenge we have yet faced.|$|E

[...] Gravel said, [...] "Something is monitoring the planet, and they are monitoring it very cautiously, because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> very warlike planet," [...] and, [...] "What we're faced with here is, in areas of the media, and the government too, an effort to marginalize and ridicule people who have specific knowledge." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1915, Noether was invited {{to return to the}} University of Göttingen by David Hilbert and Felix Klein. Their effort to recruit her, however, was blocked by the philologists and historians among the {{philosophical}} faculty: women, they insisted, should not become privatdozent. One faculty member protested: [...] "What will our soldiers think when they return to the university and find that they are required to learn at the feet of a woman?" [...] Hilbert responded with indignation, stating, [...] "I do not see that the sex of the candidate is an argument against her admission as privatdozent. After all, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> university, not a bath house." ...|$|E
500|$|Bleeding Through was an American {{heavy metal}} band from Orange County, California. Formed in 1999, the band blended {{influences}} stemming from modern hardcore punk, symphonic black metal, and melodic death metal. [...] Although {{the band was}} often labeled as simply metalcore, when Brandan Schieppati {{was asked if he}} considered Bleeding Through a hardcore band, he said: [...] "I think we're a hardcore band and I'll never say <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> metal band, we're all hardcore kids and we came from the hardcore scene. Ours is just a different version of hardcore, we're trying to do something which adds a different variety to the hardcore scene, which has been sounding the same way for so long." ...|$|E

If <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> constitutional regime functioning in accordance with constitutional law we can't do this. This is atrocious.

500|$|In a 2008 {{interview}} with Kerrang! on {{a selection of}} the band's singles, Nicholas expressed his annoyance with comparisons between Coldplay and the album Pushing the Senses; he said that those comparisons were only made because he played a piano {{on many of the}} tracks that were on the album. In a 2011 {{interview with}} Cambridge-based webzine The Tab, he elaborated on his position regarding these comparisons, saying, [...] "Feeder have a much broader music dynamic musically, and <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> much heavier band, both live and on record. I {{have a lot of respect}} for Coldplay and we have toured with them, but we are two totally different bands, both dynamically and musically. I just think it's lazy journalism." ...|$|E

[...] In 2006, he reaffirmed his previous statements and further opined, [...] "When I was growing up, if I liked , I listened to it — and I went to the shows. If I didn't, I didn't. It wasn't like, 'Oh, they don't believe the same thing I do,' [...] People care {{too much about the}} fashion of it all.
