25|$|If {{the speed}} is constant, only {{multiplication}} is needed, {{but if the}} speed changes, a more powerful method of finding the distance is necessary. One such method is to approximate the distance traveled by breaking up the time into many short intervals of time, then multiplying the time elapsed in each interval {{by one of the}} speeds in that interval, and then taking the sum (a Riemann sum) of the approximate distance traveled in each interval. The basic idea is that if only a short time elapses, then the speed will stay more or less the same. However, a Riemann sum only gives an approximation of the distance traveled. <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>take</b> the limit of all such Riemann sums to find the exact distance traveled.|$|E

[...] <b>We</b> <b>must</b> <b>take</b> care that he does not slip away from us." [...] Never to see Lincoln again, Stevens left with [...] "a homely metaphor but no real {{certainty}} of having left as much as a thumbprint on Lincoln's policy.” On the evening of April 14, 1865, Lincoln was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. [...] Stevens did not attend the ceremonies when Lincoln's funeral train stopped in Lancaster; he was said to be ill. Trefousse speculated he may avoided the rites for other reasons. [...] According to Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg, Stevens stood at a railroad bridge and lifted his hat.|$|E

He was greeted by fans with signs like [...] "Don't go, Leo" [...] when the team landed in Buenos Aires. President of Argentina Mauricio Macri urged Messi not to quit, stating, [...] "We are lucky, it is one of life's pleasures, it is a gift from God to have {{the best player in the}} world in a footballing country like ours... Lionel Messi is the greatest thing we have in Argentina and <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>take</b> care of him." [...] Mayor of Buenos Aires Horacio Rodríguez Larreta unveiled a statue of Messi in the capital to convince him reconsider retirement. On social networks, NoTeVayasLeo became a global trending topic, and even a playlist on Spotify. The campaign also continued in the streets and avenues of the Argentine capital, with about 50,000 supporters going to the Obelisco de Buenos Aires on 2 July, using the same slogan.|$|E

With Roosevelt's help, he secured a post training American pilots for a flight squadron on Long Island. His training work was halted when, veering to avoid a photographer who had run {{in front of his}} airplane as he landed, he crashed on landing and severely injured his right wrist. During a second trip to Kalacoon while his wrist healed, Beebe was further devastated to discover that due to wartime demand for rubber, the entire jungle surrounding the house had been clear-cut to make room for rubber trees. Since the purpose of Kalacoon station had been to study the jungle, the jungle's destruction left Beebe with no choice but to close the station and return with its supplies to New York. Combined with his earlier loss of Blair, the effect of losing Kalacoon plunged Beebe into depression. This did not go unnoticed by Beebe's mentor Osborn, who expressed concern about it in a letter to Madison Grant, writing [...] "I find that he is worried and far from well.

Therefore <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>take</b> a man whose opinions are known." [...] Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court. Noah Haynes Swayne, nominated January 21, 1862, and appointed January 24, 1862, was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union. Samuel Freeman Miller, nominated and appointed on July 16, 1862, supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. David Davis, Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860, nominated December 1, 1862, and appointed December 8, 1862, had {{also served as a}} judge in Lincoln's Illinois court circuit. Stephen Johnson Field, a previous California Supreme Court justice, was nominated March 6, 1863, and appointed March 10, 1863, and provided geographic balance, as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat. Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, Salmon P. Chase, was nominated as Chief Justice, and appointed the same day, on December 6, 1864. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party.|$|E
500|$|A problem arose {{historically}} {{which held}} up progress for twenty years: although {{we start with}} the assumption of three basic [...] "simple" [...] actions, {{the rules of the game}} say that if we want to calculate the probability amplitude for an electron to get from A to B <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>take</b> into account all the possible ways: all possible Feynman diagrams with those end points. [...] Thus there will be a way in which the electron travels to C, emits a photon there and then absorbs it again at D before moving on to B. Or it could do this kind of thing twice, or more. In short we have a fractal-like situation in which if we look closely at a line it breaks up into a collection of [...] "simple" [...] lines, each of which, if looked at closely, are in turn composed of [...] "simple" [...] lines, and so on ad infinitum. This is a very difficult situation to handle. If adding that detail only altered things slightly then it would not have been too bad, but disaster struck when it was found that the simple correction mentioned above led to infinite probability amplitudes. In time this problem was [...] "fixed" [...] by the technique of renormalization. However, Feynman himself remained unhappy about it, calling it a [...] "dippy process".|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} spring of 1798, Bonaparte left his command at Boulogne and {{returned}} to Paris, reporting that continued British naval supremacy in Northern European waters made an invasion impossible in the near future. With operations to the north impossible, Bonaparte directed his attention southwards to Toulon, the principal French seaport on the Mediterranean. There a French army and fleet had begun assembling for a secret location, speculated by French commentators to be aimed at {{a wide variety of}} places, including among others Britain, Sicily, Malta and the Crimea. The expedition's intended target was actually Egypt, which formed an important link in the chain of communications between Britain and the economically vital colony of British India. Bonaparte considered the capture of Egypt as the most important step in neutralising the massive economic benefits that Britain gained from trade with India and bringing Britain to terms: in August 1797 he wrote [...] "The time is not far away that we will feel that, in order to truly destroy England, <b>we</b> <b>must</b> <b>take</b> Egypt." [...] Possession of Egypt could grant the French control of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea, forcing severe delays to dispatches sent between Britain and India and obstructing trade worth £2.7 million (the equivalent of £ as of [...] ) to the British economy. In addition, a successful invasion of Egypt could be followed by a direct attack on British territory in India, possibly in conjunction with the anglophobic Tippoo Sultan of Seringapatam. The French Mediterranean Fleet was unopposed at the start of 1798 – following the Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1796, in which Spain formed an alliance with France and declared war on Britain, the Royal Navy had withdrawn from the Mediterranean bases of Corsica and Elba. By early 1798, their Mediterranean Fleet was based at the Tagus River in Portugal, their one remaining continental ally. With no permanent British fleet in the Mediterranean and an uprising imminent in Ireland, Bonaparte firmly believed that the Royal Navy would be unable to intervene in his plans, even if they should discover them.|$|E
