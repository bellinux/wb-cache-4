25|$|The {{flexible}} sealing surfaces preventing infiltration around the <b>window</b> <b>unit</b> can also degrade or be torn or damaged. Replacement of these seals {{can be difficult}} to impossible, due to IG windows commonly using extruded channel frames without seal retention screws or plates. Instead, the edge seals are installed by pushing an arrow-shaped indented one-way flexible lip into a slot on the extruded channel, and often cannot be easily extracted from the extruded slot to be replaced.|$|E
25|$|In {{accordance}} with terms and agreement {{reached in the}} Montreal Protocol (The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer) the United States Environmental Protection Agency has mandated that production or import of R-22 along with other hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) be phased-out in the United States. In the EU and the USA, virgin R22 cannot be used for manufacture of new air conditioning or similar units from 1 January 2010. In {{other parts of the}} world the phase-out date varies from country to country. Today, all newly manufactured <b>window</b> <b>unit</b> air conditioners and mini split air conditioners in the United States come with R-410A only.|$|E
50|$|Created by Nextivity, Inc., the Cel-Fi {{systems are}} {{designed}} with smart antenna technology {{to seek out the}} best available signal to maximize signal gain to phone users. The Cel-Fi consists of two wireless devices, a <b>window</b> <b>unit</b> and coverage unit, that work jointly to increase 3G and 4G mobile broadband connectivity throughout the building. The <b>window</b> <b>unit</b> receives the signal and relays it to the receiver, which converts it and amplifies it.|$|E

50|$|Between 2000 and 2002, the General Motors Building was {{thoroughly}} renovated {{to house the}} State of Michigan offices. Architect Eric J. Hill participated in the redevelopment which was headed by Albert Kahn and Associates, the original architects. In addition to upgrading existing systems, reconfiguring some spaces and redecorating, the project installed central air conditioning. When the building was first occupied, it was cooled in the warmer months by opening windows. Later, General Motors installed <b>window</b> <b>units</b> to cool various offices and work areas. During the renovation, large-scale systems replaced almost 1,900 <b>window</b> <b>units</b> that were left when GM vacated the structure.|$|R

5000|$|Harrison House [...] was a {{historic}} building in Centerville, Pennsylvania. It was built c. 1845 as a Post Colonial Greek Revival house, and later updated to a High Victorian Italianate style. The five-bay -story structure with a two-story bay <b>window</b> <b>unit</b> with a turret roof and a four-story tower was {{unusual for the}} Washington County, Pennsylvania area.|$|E
50|$|Many {{episodes in}} which Springfield is hit by extreme heatwaves {{indicate}} that the air-conditioning system in the Simpson home is either broken or nonexistent. In a flashback episode, Homer steals Ned Flanders's air conditioner and installs {{it in his own}} house—a <b>window</b> <b>unit,</b> indicating that neither the Simpson nor Flanders residence has central air (although Ned can afford window units).|$|E
50|$|<b>Window</b> <b>unit</b> {{air conditioners}} are {{installed}} {{in an open}} window. The interior air is cooled as a fan blows it over the evaporator. On the exterior the heat drawn from the interior is dissipated into the environment as a second fan blows outside air over the condenser. A large house or building may have several such units, allowing each room to be cooled separately.|$|E
50|$|The {{educational}} wing of {{the building}} is built {{in the north of}} the sanctuary. The roof is a series of gable roofs. The windows of the building are punched openings in a continuous pattern. The <b>window</b> <b>units</b> are steel casement in a two over one operable hopper configuration.|$|R
50|$|The {{rear section}} of the front wing, which {{contains}} the main Court room, has two-storeyed enclosed arcades on either side. The ground floor has arched openings, and the first floor has taller openings framed with pilasters supporting a deep cornice, infilled with metal framed <b>window</b> <b>units</b> and rendered masonry.|$|R
50|$|The baptistery has a {{circular}} plan, and in elevation comprises narrow reinforced concrete arched <b>window</b> <b>units</b> surmounted by reinforced concrete spandrel panels and separated by brick piers.

The window strips themselves, trimmed in wood, are units of five tall four-over-four double-hing sash windows on the upper two stories and shorter two-over-two at the basement. The northernmost <b>window</b> <b>unit</b> on the basement has been bricked in.|$|E
50|$|The Franklin H. Walker House was a two-and-one-half-story structure, {{constructed}} of brown brick and rock-faced limestone. The massive Neo-Jacobean house was irregular in both floorplan and in height. A medieval-influenced octagonal tower with a pointed roof projected from {{one corner of}} the house; at the other corner, a two-story, three-sided bay <b>window</b> <b>unit</b> projected from the main bulk of the house. The gable roof was covered with tiles; walls at the gable ends terminated in fractables.|$|E

50|$|Internal timber is unpainted. A carved timber {{cross and}} the organ pipes are {{positioned}} above the tie-beam {{in front of}} the transept. Internal walls are of vertically jointed boards and <b>window</b> <b>units</b> consist of three timber framed lancets with pale green leadlight glazing, some of which have stained glass inserts.|$|R
50|$|Central {{air-conditioning}} was {{a feature}} of the original construction, but records indicate that more than 270 <b>window</b> <b>units</b> were installed over time, and then removed during a 1989 restoration. Handicapped access was installed at the eastern entrance on Market Street, but otherwise the exterior appears as it was originally designed.|$|R
5000|$|The primary {{disadvantage}} of ductless air conditioners is their cost. Such systems cost about US$1,500 to US$2,000 per ton (12,000 BTU per hour) of cooling capacity. This is about 30% more than central systems (not including ductwork) and may {{cost more than}} twice as much as <b>window</b> <b>units</b> of similar capacity." ...|$|R
50|$|Depending {{on climate}} and with {{adequate}} thermal mass, south-facing glass {{area in a}} direct gain system {{should be limited to}} about 10 to 20% of the floor area (e.g., 10 to 20 ft2 of glass for a 100 ft2 floor area). This should be based on the net glass or glazing area. Note that most windows have a net glass/glazing area that is 75 to 85% of the overall <b>window</b> <b>unit</b> area. Above this level, problems with overheating, glare and fading of fabrics are likely.|$|E

5000|$|B-24H: Because {{of obvious}} {{vulnerability}} of the B-24 to head-on attack with the earlier, 24-panel [...] "greenhouse" [...] nose glazing, the B-24H design incorporated an electrically powered Emerson A-15 nose turret above the bombardier's position, somewhat similar to where the Frazer-Nash FN5 nose turret on the Avro Lancaster was placed. Approximately 50 other airframe changes were made, including a redesigned bombardier compartment possessing a glazed three-panel bombsight <b>window</b> <b>unit</b> replacing the [...] "greenhouse" [...] nose design. The tail turret was given larger windows for better visibility and the Martin A-3 dorsal turret received an enlarged [...] "high hat" [...] dome. The waist gunner positions were enclosed with Plexiglas windows and laterally offset (as the later B-17G's waist positions had been) to reduce mutual interference between the two waist gunners during battle. Most H model aircraft were built by Ford at the Willow Run factory. (Total: 3,100) ...|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "museum" [...] wing is {{constructed}} of chamferboard {{and has a}} corrugated iron gable roof and is supported by brick piers with latticed timber infill panels. The southern elevation is highly decorative, with a central bay window flanked by non-original casement windows (with a corner <b>window</b> <b>unit</b> to the southwest corner) and surmounted by timber detailing to the gable. The bay has narrow sash windows with etched and coloured glass panes and timber shutters. The bay is crowned by a timber valance consisting of triple curved sections, and paired lancet windows with leadlight panels {{are located in the}} gable above. The gable has a metal finial, and a battened timber screen with an arched central section and curved timber trim supported by curved timber brackets.

50|$|The Court House is a {{single-storeyed}} rendered masonry building, with a hipped {{corrugated iron}} roof, fronting the Abbott Street gardens to the southwest. The building is T-shaped in plan, with offices and subsidiary court rooms forming the western wing {{and the main}} court room forming the eastern wing. The central entrance of the western wing has a recessed porch with a slightly projecting facade surmounted by a stepped parapet with a curved pediment, cornice and a lion and unicorn crest. This is supported by two columns flanked by pilasters and a section of concrete balustrade to either side. The southwest facade comprises a series of triple window units separated by pilasters with an expressed base, jettied eaves and deep sills. Each <b>window</b> <b>unit</b> has a double casement with a single casement either side and panelled hoppers above. An extra bay {{has been added to}} the north and south ends providing chambers and toilet facilities.|$|E
50|$|The {{water that}} {{condenses}} on the evaporator {{in an air}} conditioner is usually routed to remove extracted water from the conditioned space. Newer high-efficiency <b>window</b> <b>units</b> use the condensed water to help cool the condenser coil by evaporating the water into the outdoor air, while older units simply allowed the water to drip outside.|$|R
50|$|Both {{sides of}} the Cathedral {{comprise}} twelve reinforced concrete arched <b>window</b> <b>units</b> surmounted by reinforced concrete spandrel panels and separated by brick piers, with wider panels of brickwork at either end. Paired timber panelled doors surmounted by pivoting fanlights are located below each arched window and open from the nave and sanctuary onto the side verandahs. The fanlights are glazed to match the arched windows above. Three bays of the southern verandah are enclosed to form a side chapel adjacent to the sanctuary. This side chapel has five narrow reinforced concrete arched <b>window</b> <b>units</b> which are separated by brick piers. All windows in the Cathedral were originally glazed with a burgundy red field and an amber border; however the eastern windows {{and a number of}} the northern windows to the nave and sanctuary have been reglazed with stained/painted glass. Two sets of paired confessionals, which are the same height as the side doors and are surmounted by fanlights, are located on both side verandahs.|$|R
50|$|The Garden Court Apartments is an H-shaped {{building}} standing nine stories {{tall with}} a symmetrical façade facing Jefferson Avenue.
