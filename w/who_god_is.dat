Heather Phares wrote for AllMusic the song [...] "flirts with satire" [...] in its usage {{in the film}} because [...] " [...] threatened by these upstarts from other cliques invading their territory", in reference of Troy and Gabriella's performance. Phares considered its medoly [...] "so bright" [...] and Tisdale and Grabeel's vocals [...] "so relentlessly cheery, {{it sounds like a}} parody of a show tune". A writer for Talkin' Broadway echoed this view, describing the song as [...] "a clever parody of Broadway styles". Chris Willman, for Entertainment Weekly, compared the song with [...] "You Are The Music In Me", a song included in the sequel High School Musical 2. He wrote [...] "both an earnest Troy/Gabriella duet and an insincere (but more fun) showstopper for self-absorbed Sharpay". A reviewer for Common Sense Media highlighted the track. Commenting on the reprise, DVD Verdict said it [...] "is a little soft". The Christian Broadcasting Network offered a spiritual analysis of the song: [...] " [...] a great opportunity to look at <b>who</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> and His character, including the fact that He's always with us." ...|$|E

60|$|And, I say, {{that the}} Catechism does give a true {{conception}} of Christ; and more, a far truer one--I had almost said, an infinitely truer--than any which I have yet seen in these realms: {{that from the}} Catechism a child may learn <b>who</b> <b>God</b> <b>is,</b> who Christ is, who he himself is, what are his relation and duty to God, what are his relation and duty to his neighbours, to his country, and to the whole human race, far better than from any document {{of the kind of}} which I am aware.|$|E

They have not been taught that God is loveable; they have been taught that God feels feelings, and does deeds, which if a man felt, or did, we should call him arbitrary, proud, revengeful, cruel: and yet they are told to love him; and they {{do not know how to}} love such a being as that.

He has given thee ten commandments, and let no man give thee an eleventh commandment {{out of his own}} conceit and will worship; calling unclean what God hath made clean, and cursing what God hath blessed. [...] Thou lovest God? Then thou lovest all that is good; for God is good, and from Him all good things come. But what is good? All is good except sin; for it is written, [...] "God saw every thing that He had made, and, behold, it was very good." [...] Therefore, if thou lovest God, thou must love all things, for all things are of Him, and by Him, and through Him; and in Him all live and move and have their being. Then thou wilt truly love God. Thou wilt be content with God; and so thy love will cast out fear. [...] Thou wilt trust God; thou wilt have the mind of God; thou wilt be satisfied with God's working, from {{the rise and fall of}} great nations to the life and death of the smallest gnat which dances in the sun; thou wilt say for ever, and concerning all things, I know in whom I have believed.

5000|$|Catholics {{believe that}} <b>God,</b> <b>who</b> {{in our view}} by his divine nature cannot change, has united with {{changing}} human nature, and therefore with human pain. The [...] "I" [...] of the Second Person suffers and feels pain. He is one with pain through Jesus Christ. Thus Christ's experience of pain (like all the human acts of Christ like sleeping, crying, speaking) whose subject is the divine Person is an infinite act. This {{is based on the}} classic dictum that the acts belong to the Person (actiones sunt suppositorum). It is the Person <b>who</b> acts: It <b>is</b> <b>God</b> <b>who</b> walks, <b>God</b> <b>who</b> talks, <b>God</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> killed, and <b>God</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> in pain.

6000|$|Others {{may tell}} you to think of God's {{dealings}} with his people. I answer--In good time, but not yet; think first of God. For how can you rightly understand God's dealings, unless you first rightly understand <b>who</b> <b>God</b> <b>is,</b> and what his character is? Right notions concerning your own soul, right notions concerning God's dealings, can only come from right notions concerning God himself. He is before all things. Think of him before all things. He is the first, {{and he is the}} last. Think of him first in this life, and so you will think of him last, and for ever in the life to come. Think of the Father, that he is a Father indeed, in spirit and in truth. Think of the Son, that he is a Son indeed, in spirit and in truth. Think of the Holy Spirit, that he is a Holy Spirit indeed, in spirit and in truth. So you will be thinking indeed of the Ever-blessed Trinity; and will worship God, not with your lips or your thoughts merely, but in spirit and in truth. Think of the Father, that he is the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, and that the perfect Son must be forever perfectly like the perfect Father. For then you will believe that God the Father looks on you, and feels for you, exactly as does Jesus Christ your Lord; then you will feel that he is a Father indeed; and will enter more and more into the unspeakable comfort of that word of all words, 'Our Father who art in heaven.' ...|$|E
60|$|First, these heathens had a dim remembrance {{that man}} {{was made in the}} {{likeness}} of God, and lived by Faith in God, and therefore that men's names were to express that, as indeed many of their old names do. But, alas! the likeness of God in fallen man is like a tree without roots, or rather a tree without soil to grow in. God's likeness in man can only flourish as long as he is joined to Christ, the perfect likeness of God, the true life and the true light of men, the foundation which is already laid, and the soil in which man was meant to grow and flourish for ever, and as long as he is fed by the Spirit of God, the Lord and Giver of Life, who proceeds--never forget that, or you will lose the understanding both of <b>who</b> <b>God</b> <b>is</b> and what man is--proceeds not only from God the Father, but also from God the Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. And therefore, in the heathen, God's likeness withered and decayed, as a tree withers and decays when torn up from the soil. And first, they began to call themselves after the names of false gods, which they had invented out of their own carnal fancies. Then they called themselves after the names of their dumb animal's. So, Pharaoh means, 'The Sun-God'; the Ammonites mean, 'The people who worshipped the ram as a god'; Potiphar means, 'A fat bull,' which the Egyptians used to worship; and I could tell you of hundreds of heathen names more, like these, which are ridiculous enough to make one smile, if we did not keep in mind what tokens they are of sin and ignorance, and the likeness not of God, but of the beasts which perish.|$|E

So, after school, I called him to me, and putting him before my knees asked him some questions very kindly: [...] "Did he know who God was? Had he never been taught to kneel down and say his prayers? Of course he had not, but it gave me the proper opportunity of speaking to his parents. So having now considered the matter {{for two or three}} days previously, having ascertained all the facts about the people, after an hour among some others in the village, I went right into their cottage, and luckily found father and mother and grandmother at home, besides one or two more (who are lodgers) in a room adjoining, with the door open. [...] "I am come to talk to you about William," [...] I began, whereupon I saw the woman turn quite red. However, I spoke for about ten minutes slowly and very quietly, without any appearance (as I believe) of anger or passion at all, but yet speaking my mind quite plainly. [...] "I had no idea any child could be so neglected. Did they suppose the school was a place where any parent might send a child merely to get it out of the way (of course they do, you know, most of them)? Was it possible that a child could be made good as if by magic there, when it learns nothing but wicked words at home? Do you think you can or ought to get rid of the duties you owe your child? Do you suppose that God will not require from you an account of the way you have behaved towards him, you who have never taught him to know <b>who</b> <b>God</b> <b>is,</b> what God is, what is prayer, what is the church, who have taught that little mouth, which God created for praise and blessings, to curse and blaspheme? I know that many children do and say wicked things, but it is in most cases owing to the neglect of their parents, who do not speak kindly to their children, and do what they can to keep them out of temptation, but this is a different case. [...] Your boy is not fit to come into the company of little Christians! Awful as it is to think of, he is already, at his early age, the very dread of the parents who live near you." ...|$|E

He alone will {{understand}} the mystery of <b>who</b> <b>God</b> <b>is,</b> and why He made all things.

And why? Because love can only love what is somewhat like itself, He made all things according {{to the idea of}} His own eternal mind. Because He is unchangeable, and a God of order and of law, He made all things according to one order, and gave them a law which cannot be broken, that they might continue this day as they were at the beginning, serving Him and fulfilling His word. Because He is a God of justice, He made all things just, depending on each other, helping each other, and compelled to sacrifice themselves for each other, and minister to each other whether they will or not. Because He is a God of beauty, He made all things beautiful, of a variety and a richness unspeakable, that He might rejoice in all His works, and find a divine delight in every moss which grows upon the moor, and every gnat which dances in the sun. Because He is a God of love, He gave to every creature a power of happiness according to its kind, that He might rejoice in the happiness of His creatures. And lastly, because God is a spirit--a moral and a rational Being--therefore He created rational beings to be more like Him than any other creatures, and constituted the services of men and angels in a most wonderful order, that they might reverence law as He does, and justice as He does--that they might love to be loving as He loves, and to be useful as He is useful--that they might rejoice in the beauty of His works as He rejoices in them Himself; and, catching from time to time fuller and fuller glimpses of that Divine and wonderful order according to which He has made all things and all worlds, may see more and more clearly, as the years roll on, that all things are just, and beautiful, and good; and join more and more heartily in the hymn which goes up for ever from every sun, and star, and world, and from the tiniest creature in these worlds: [...] "Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power; for Thou hast created all things, and for Thy pleasure they are and were created." ...|$|E
