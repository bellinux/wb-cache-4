40|$|Abstract: In this study, {{optical and}} thermal {{properties}} of normal <b>grade</b> and <b>winter</b> <b>grade</b> {{palm oil biodiesel}} were investigated. Surface Plasmon Resonance and Photopyroelectric technique were {{used to evaluate the}} samples. The dispersion curve and thermal diffusivity were obtained. Consequently, the variation of refractive index, as a function of wavelength in normal grade biodiesel is faster than <b>winter</b> <b>grade</b> palm oil biodiesel, and the thermal diffusivity of <b>winter</b> <b>grade</b> biodiesel is higher than the thermal diffusivity of normal grade biodiesel. This is attributed to the higher palmitic acid C 16 : 0 content in normal <b>grade</b> than in <b>winter</b> <b>grade</b> palm oil biodiesel...|$|R

5000|$|The four {{cylinder}} engine introduced {{with the}} Rekord B came in three sizes: 1492cc, 1698cc and 1897cc. The three engines features the same 69.8 mm stroke length, but the bore varied from 82.5 to 93.0. Claimed power output ranged between 60 hp (44 kW) on the smallest engine and 90 hp (66 kW). The 1492cc engine still accepted [...] "normal" [...] <b>grade</b> <b>petrol,</b> but the larger two engines, with higher compression ratios, both required higher octane fuels. The 1492cc engine still {{came with a}} traditional [...] "manual" [...] choke, while the larger engines both came with a [...] "semi-automatic" [...] choke.

To save aluminium, the light alloy block used in the HL 210 {{was replaced by a}} cast iron block. Two multistage [...] "cyclone" [...] air filters were used to improve dust removal.

5000|$|... Iran has 3,200 gas {{stations}} for 15 million automobiles. Demand {{is supported by}} the fixing of fuel prices well below market levels. There are two pricing schemes for petrol, one subsidized the other not. Each month, qualified vehicle owners are allocated a specific number of subsidized liters of petrol (taxi's have a significantly higher allocation). The cost of regular unsubsidized petrol in Iran is IR7,000/liter (approximately 37 US cents/liter) and premium <b>grade</b> <b>petrol</b> IR8,000/liter, whereas the subsidized equivalents go for IR4,000/liter and IR5,000/liter, respectively. The nation's abundant oil reserves have enabled the government to keep prices low (Iran is the second-largest exporter in OPEC). However, low prices have encouraged wasteful consumption and the smuggling of petrol into neighbouring countries such as Turkey, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Some 1.8 billion liters of oil products worth 10 trillion rials ($1 billion) are smuggled out of Iran per annum.|$|R
5000|$|LPG is {{prepared}} by refining petroleum or [...] "wet" [...] natural gas, and {{is almost entirely}} derived from fossil fuel sources, being manufactured during the refining of petroleum (crude oil), or extracted from petroleum or natural gas streams as they emerge from the ground. It was first produced in 1910 by Dr. Walter Snelling, and the first commercial products appeared in 1912. It currently provides about 3% of all energy consumed, and burns relatively cleanly with no soot and very few sulfur emissions. As it is a gas, it does not pose ground or water pollution hazards, but it can cause air pollution. LPG has a typical specific calorific value of 46.1 MJ/kg compared with 42.5 MJ/kg for fuel oil and 43.5 MJ/kg for premium <b>grade</b> <b>petrol</b> (gasoline). However, its energy density per volume unit of 26 MJ/L is lower than either that of petrol or fuel oil, as its relative density is lower (about 0.5-0.58 kg/L, compared to 0.71-0.77 kg/L for gasoline).|$|R
40|$|Plasma {{cortisol}} {{concentrations in}} farmed rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) {{were used to}} determine the stress caused by feeding, counting, grading and harvesting. The effect of carrying out these practices with the addition of an aerator was also determined. The cortisol concentration in trout plasma was assessed using enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Pre-feeding levels were found to be 3 - 4 ng/ml. Feeding, counting, grading and harvesting produced significant elevations in plasma cortisol. The presence of an aerator during these practices significantly reduced this cortisol response. The plasma cortisol response during <b>winter</b> <b>grading</b> was significantly less (...|$|R
5|$|The {{north face}} {{is also one}} of Scotland's {{foremost}} venues for winter mountaineering and ice climbing, and holds snow until quite late in the year; in a good year, routes may remain in winter condition until mid-spring. Most of the possible rock routes are also suitable as winter climbs, including the four main ridges; Tower Ridge, for example, is grade IV on the Scottish <b>winter</b> <b>grading</b> system, having been upgraded in 2009 by the Scottish Mountaineering Club after requests by the local Mountain Rescue Team, there being numerous benightments and incidents every winter season. Probably the most popular ice climb on Ben Nevis is The Curtain (IV,5) {{on the left side of}} the Càrn Dearg Buttress.

5000|$|During the {{two decades}} that {{followed}} the Second World War, the available fuels in Europe had featured progressively higher octane ratings, and compression ratios of European cars had increased correspondingly. However, the cheaper (so called yellow <b>grade)</b> <b>petrol</b> widely distributed in Brazil in 1976 had an octane rating of just 73, so for Brazil {{it was necessary to}} use a relatively low compression ratio of 7.2 to 1. In order to provide adequate power with the lower compression ratio, a larger engine was needed, and the Fiat 147 was launched with a [...] unit with a five-bearing crankshaft in place of the , three-bearing engine that then was still standard in the 127s from Turin. Press reports of the time reported that the larger engine produced a much smoother and quieter drive as well as enhanced torque. [...] The [...] engine, along with some of the revised bodyshell elements of the 147 (most notably the rear three-quarter panels) were later introduced on the Series 2 version of the 127 itself, when it was released in Europe a year later.|$|R
50|$|In Scotland, the Scottish <b>winter</b> <b>grading</b> {{system is}} used for both ice and mixed climbs. Routes are given two grades, {{essentially}} equivalent to the adjectival and technical grades used in British traditional climbing. Overall difficulty is signified by a Roman numeral grade, and the technical difficulty of the hardest move or section of the climb is graded with an Arabic numeral. For routes of grade I - III, the technical grade is usually omitted unless it is 4 or greater. As with other grading systems, advances in climbing {{have led to a}} need for an open-ended grading system (the grades originally finished at IX, 9), and climbs have now been graded up to XII, 12.|$|R
50|$|For single <b>winter</b> <b>grade</b> oils, {{the dynamic}} {{viscosity}} is measured at different cold temperatures, specified in J300 {{depending on the}} viscosity grade, in units of mPa·s, or the equivalent older non-SI units, centipoise (abbreviated cP), using two different test methods. They are the Cold Cranking Simulator (ASTMD5293) and the Mini-Rotary Viscometer (ASTM D4684). Based on the coldest temperature the oil passes at, that oil is graded as SAE viscosity grade 0W, 5W, 10W, 15W, 20W, or 25W. The lower the viscosity grade, the lower the temperature the oil can pass. For example, if an oil passes at the specifications for 10W and 5W, but fails for 0W, then that oil must be labeled as an SAE 5W. That oil cannot be labeled as either 0W or 10W.|$|R

40|$|Age {{interpretation}} of yellow perch using anal spine sections Interpretation of annual marks to determine age of fish is a commonly accepted practice in fishery science (Nielsen and Johnson. 1983). Growth marks on various hard parts {{are used to}} interpret age in bony fish (Hirethota and Ringler 1993). Spiny rayed species such as yellow perch in Lake Michigan are aged using scale, otolith, spine, and opercle. The Southern Lake Michigan Fisheries Unit of Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) has been conducting various annual assessments of the yellow perch population since 1985. Reliable and easily applicable technique for accurate age determination is critical for effective management of natural fish populations, especially species of such high economic value. WDNR used scales for determining age of perch until 2000. However, age interpretation based on annual marks on scales has its own limitations. In January 2000, we evaluated three different structures – scale, otolith and anal spine to compare aging of yellow perch. Samples of scales, otoliths and anal spines from each of 242 yellow perch were collected during our annual <b>winter</b> <b>graded</b> mesh gill net assessment. Ages were assigne...|$|R
