Only 9% of the sex scenes on 1,300 of cable network programming discusses and deals with the negative consequences of sexual behavior. The Internet may further provide adolescents with poor information on health issues, sexuality, and sexual violence.|$|E

However, abnormally high doses of ibuprofen can still potentially cause a false positive in not only THC but other drugs such as barbiturates. Nonetheless, this no longer works as an alibi for THC since GC/MS can now distinguish between the two.|$|E

25|$|This {{practice}} {{may have}} arisen {{out of a}} Jewish prohibition of singing songs of the non-Jews (due to the secular character and lyrics of the songs). This <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the case of Arabic songs, whereby Jews were allowed {{to listen to the}} songs, but not allowed to sing them with the text. In order to bypass the problem, many composers, throughout the centuries, wrote new lyrics to the songs with the existing melodies, in order not to violate the tradition of not singing non-Jewish songs.|$|E

By mid-1929, Hollywood was producing almost exclusively sound films; by the end of the following year, the same <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> much of Western Europe.

After the luncheon, Ridgway met privately for two hours with President Lyndon Johnson and Vice-President Hubert Humphrey. When asked his opinion, Ridgway advised against deeper involvement in Vietnam and against using force to resolve the Pueblo Incident. In an article in Foreign Affairs, Ridgway stated that political goals should be based on vital national interests and that military goals should be consistent with and support the political goals, but that neither situation <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the Vietnam War.|$|E
25|$|In ancient Egyptian art, female {{pubic hair}} is {{indicated}} {{in the form of}} painted triangles. In medieval and classical European art, pubic hair was very rarely depicted, and male pubic hair was often, but not always, omitted. Sometimes it was portrayed in stylized form, {{as was the case with}} Greek graphic art. The same <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> much of Indian art, and in other Eastern portrayals of the nude. In 16th century southern Europe, Michelangelo showed the male David with stylized pubic hair, but female bodies were depicted hairless below the head. Nevertheless, Michelangelo's male nudes on the Sistine Chapel ceiling display no pubic hair. In Renaissance northern Europe, pubic hair was more likely to be portrayed than in the south, more usually male, while occasionally on female figures.|$|E
25|$|The {{level of}} {{education}} one has attained has played a large part in Mexican feminism. Schoolteachers, in most cultures, {{are some of the}} first women to enter the work force and the same <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> Mexico. Many of the early feminists who emerged from the Revolution were teachers either before or after the war, as were the participants of the Primer Congreso Feminista, the first feminist congress in Mexico. The participants in the Mexico 68 clashes who went on to form that generation's feminist movement were predominantly students and educators. The advisers who established themselves within the unions after the 1985 earthquakes were educated women who understood the legal and political aspects of organized labor. What they realized was that to form a sustained movement and attract working class women, they needed to utilize worker's expertise and knowledge of their jobs to meld a practical, working system.|$|E

25|$|In 1852 the Original Secession Church {{joined the}} Free Church; in 1876 {{most of the}} Reformed Presbyterian Church {{followed}} suit. However, a leadership-led attempt to unite with the United Presbyterians was not successful. These attempts began as early as 1863 when the Free Church began talks with the UPC {{with a view to}} a union. However, a report laid before the Assembly of 1864 showed that the two churches were not agreed as to the relationship between state and church. The Free Church maintained that national resources could be used in aid of the church, provided that the state abstain from all interference in its internal government. The United Presbyterians held that, as the state had no authority in spiritual things, it was not within its jurisdiction to legislate as to what <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> religion, prescribe a creed or any form of worship for its subjects, or to endow the church from national resources. Any union would therefore have to leave this question open. At the time this difference was sufficient to preclude the union being pursued.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{increasing}} visibility through his books, LaVey {{was the subject}} of numerous articles in the news media throughout the world, including popular magazines such as Look, McCall's, Newsweek, and Time, and men's magazines. He also appeared on talk shows such as The Joe Pyne Show, Donahue and The Tonight Show, and in a feature-length documentary called Satanis in 1970. He would be credited for the mainstreaming of Satanism and witchcraft in the U.S. during the 1960s, 1970s and after. LaVey claimed that he had been appointed consultant to the film Rosemary's Baby, which revolved around a group of fictional Satanists, and that he also had a cameo appearance in the film as the Devil, however critics have argued that none of this <b>was</b> <b>true.</b> <b>In</b> an article published in Rolling Stone magazine in 1991, the journalist Lawrence Wright revealed that through his own investigative work, he found that many of LaVey's claims about his life had been untrue. Two official biographies have been written on LaVey, including The Devil's Avenger by Burton H. Wolfe, published in 1974 and The Secret Life of a Satanist by Blanche Barton, published in 1990.|$|E

In 1976 he published a novel, The Canfield Decision, about an American vice president's troubled {{relationship with his}} president. The book received mixed reviews, but was commercially successful, Agnew receiving $100,000 for serialization rights alone. The book landed Agnew in controversy; his fictional counterpart, George Canfield, refers to [...] "Jewish cabals and Zionist lobbies" [...] and their hold over the American media, a charge which Agnew, while on a book tour, asserted <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> real life. This brought complaints from Seymour Graubard, of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, and a rebuke from President Ford, then campaigning for reelection. Agnew denied any antisemitism or bigotry: [...] "My contention is that routinely the American news media ... favors the Israeli position and does not in a balanced way present the other equities".|$|E
500|$|Many erratic surface {{fractures}} {{were generated}} in the San Joaquin Valley along the White Wolf Fault. The cracks were not well-defined, and {{were the result of}} the disturbance of the alluvium that makes up the valley floor, rather than cracking along the fault trace. Northeast trending cracks ranging from hairline-width to near five inches wide were seen between Arvin and California State Route 166, and some showed clear lateral offset, but those were determined to be localized effects. Some of the fractures in the ground were aligned with the fault, and some were perpendicular to the general trend, but the more significant breaks were believed to be a direct result of faulting at depth. This <b>was</b> <b>true</b> <b>in</b> the mountainous areas as well, but some of the breaks at the higher elevations were probably related to slumping. The northeast trending breaks were described in a report from the State of California (that was prepared by well-known geologists and seismologists) as [...] "thrusting of the southeast block up and over the northwest block, and/or a lateral movement of the southeast block to the northeast".|$|E

Erica Durance believed that Lois in season five, because of her self-imposed walls, laughed off any notion that she had a romantic interest in Clark, even if that notion <b>was</b> <b>true.</b> <b>In</b> season six, Durance described the relationship between Lois and Clark as something neither character wanted to put an official label on. Instead, Durance believed that, by that point in the series, Clark and Lois were satisfied with identifying with a [...] "brother and sister friendship" [...] label, rather than trying to discover how each truly feels. By season eight, Durance noted that Lois was starting to accept the idea that she may be in love with Clark more than she had been with anyone else in her life. His relationship with Lois was included in TV Guides list of the best TV couples of all time.|$|E
