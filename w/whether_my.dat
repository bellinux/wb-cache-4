5|$|The {{books are}} based on the vampire myth, but Twilight vampires differ in a number of {{particulars}} from the general vampire lore. For instance, Twilight vampires have strong piercing teeth rather than fangs; they glitter in sunlight rather than burn; and they can drink animal as well as human blood. Meyer comments that her vampire mythology differs from that of other authors because she wasn't informed about the canon vampires, saying, It wasn't until I knew that Twilight would be published that I began to think about <b>whether</b> <b>my</b> vampires were too much the same or too much different from the others. Of course, I was far too invested in my characters at that point to be making changes... so I didn't cut out fangs and coffins and so forth as a way to distinguish my vampires; that's just how they came to me.|$|E

500|$|Chinga, the titular evil doll, {{was created}} by sewing {{together}} various doll parts. An oversized doll's head {{was placed on the}} finished body and [...] "the world's largest wig" [...] adorned its head. Props master Ken Hawryliw later reported that the hairpiece was actually the result of several wigs being sewn together. Most of the makeup effects were created by artist Toby Lindala, who [...] "appreciate the chance to create these classics for a Stephen King project". The [...] "Death Under Glass" [...] scene featuring Dave the Butcher with a knife in his eyes was created in post-production via a computer. Special effects supervisor Laurie Kellsen-George tested the scene on her nine- and eleven-year-old sons, explaining that [...] "I gauge a lot of the show by <b>whether</b> <b>my</b> kids can stand them or not. If they can't, I figure I succeeded [...] 'Chinga' bothered them a lot." [...] Reportedly, during the self-mutilation scene in the supermarket, a real customer who had wandered onto the set saw the commotion and left in a panic.|$|E

2500|$|Truth, it is said, {{consists}} {{in the agreement}} of cognition with its object. In consequence of this mere nominal definition, my cognition, to count as true, is supposed to agree with its object. Now I can compare the object with my cognition, however, only by cognizing it. Hence my cognition is supposed to confirm itself, which is far short of being sufficient for truth. For since the object is outside me, the cognition in me, all I can ever pass judgement on is <b>whether</b> <b>my</b> cognition of the object agrees with my cognition of the object.|$|E
2500|$|The song title [...] "Yellow Ledbetter" [...] {{is derived}} from the actual name of an old friend of Vedder from Chicago, named Tim Ledbetter. Although many fans have made their own interpretations of the song, a common theory has been that the song is about someone {{receiving}} a letter and finding his or her brother had died overseas in war, cited from the lyrics in the Live at the Garden version [...] "I don't know <b>whether</b> <b>my</b> brother will be coming home in a box or a bag." [...] On the official bootleg release of 5/3/03 - State College, Pennsylvania, Vedder sings [...] "I'd like to wish this war away, and I tried, but it just, just don't happen, don't happen that way/And my brother...they sent him off to fight for the flag. I just, I don't hope he comes home in a box or a bag", and [...] "And I know that he's just following his path. As long, as long as it's not a box or a bag." [...] On the official bootleg release of 7/11/03 - Mansfield, Massachusetts, Vedder sings in the first verse [...] "I think of him when I go to bed, and he's coming home in a box or a bag." [...] It's widely known that Vedder changes the lyrics of the song when singing it live, so it's difficult to know if what he's singing at the time are the original lyrics from 1991.|$|E
2500|$|The play's {{main feature}} is its very eloquent, long, and {{authoritative}} dialogues, whereas {{the film is}} almost silent. Aravindan explains: [...] "There are some specific reasons for deciding to have sparse dialogues in Kanchana Sita. One, this episode taken from Ramayana is familiar to all. Two, Ramayana is not a supernatural reality for us, as it is ingrained in us. It is therefore not necessary to educate people about the film through lengthy dialogues. C. N. [...] had made clear the prakriti-purusha notion in Ramayana. I {{did not think that}} Sita should come in the film {{in the form of a}} woman. That is why Sita appeared in the film as prakriti and Prakriti is a character in the film. When the emotions of Sita like pain, sadness, joy, and equanimity are manifested through the moods of Prakriti, dialogue becomes redundant. I felt I could make the film without dialogue. Rama committing suicide – (I still feel it was – self immolation) had haunted me very badly. With all these, my Kanchana Sita became very different. Words were required only for very essentials. The dialogues, which I used, were from C. N. 's play. The doubt I had then was <b>whether</b> <b>my</b> Rama and Lakshmana (as they were ordinary people) could use such an eloquent Sanskritised language." [...] In another interview, he said, [...] "Dialogues are there to carry on the storyline and make it move. But when it comes to well-known stories, dialogues ceases to be an essential ingredient." [...] Dialogue was, however, included in Kanchana Sita at the end of the movie to discuss the responsibilities of the king.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the end of}} the War, Surendranath Banerjee, {{followed}} by Barin Ghose and Motilal Roy, successfully negotiated the withdrawal of warrants against the fugitives accused of the Indo-German plot. Atul was adamant in obtaining a promise on these points : (a) there would be no question of surrendering arms; (b) no questions would be raised on their past activities; (c) no parole would be demanded concerning their future conducts. Atul came out in 1921. But his Dada’s (Jatin Mukherjee’s) heroic death, [...] "had knocked out his revolutionary ardour and he gave up active politics." [...] Yet, in January 1924, when Gopinath Saha killed an Englishman, mistaking him to be Tegart, the much-hated Commissioner of Kolkata Police (reputed to have shot Jatin Mukherjee dead), Atul was made a state-prisoner, to be released in 1926. The same year he married Menokarani Rakshit of Majilpur, 24 Parganas and took to business, dissociating himself completely from politics. They had no issues. In an interview with Prithwindra Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin's grandson), on 27 October 1963 - shortly before his death -, Atul sighed: [...] "Dada was a magnet; we all, iron scraps, received our energy from him. When he was no more, we all became iron scraps. I still do not know <b>whether</b> <b>my</b> first allegiance went to Dada, or to the Motherland." [...] Asked about the source of Jatindranath's tremendous force, Atul replied: [...] "He was a very well trained wrestler and an all-round sportsman. But what characterised him was his soul force and his power of concentration. He could pin-point all his energy to a single part of his body, for instance his fist. A single blow from that fist was equivalent to an electric charge of God knows how many volts!" ...|$|E
