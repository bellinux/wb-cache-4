5|$|By 1910, most glacial {{acetic acid}} <b>was</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> the pyroligneous liquor, {{a product of the}} {{distillation}} of wood. The acetic acid was isolated by treatment with milk of lime, and the resulting calcium acetate was then acidified with sulfuric acid to recover acetic acid. At that time, Germany was producing 10,000 tons of {{glacial acetic acid}}, around 30% of which was used for the manufacture of indigo dye.|$|E
5|$|For {{many years}} Cheadle Hulme was rural countryside, {{made up of}} woods, open land, and farms. The local {{population}} {{was made up of}} farmers and peasants, living in small cottages and working the land under the tenancy of the Lord of the Manor. Most families kept animals for food, grew their own crops, and probably bought and sold produce at Stockport market. Water <b>was</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> local wells and ponds, and sometimes the Micker Brook.|$|E

5|$|A {{skeleton}} collection <b>was</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> among {{a pool of}} 115 Jewish Auschwitz inmates, {{chosen for}} their perceived stereotypical racial characteristics. Rudolf Brandt and Wolfram Sievers, {{general manager of the}} Ahnenerbe (a Nazi research institute), were responsible for delivering the skeletons to the collection of the Anatomy Institute at the Reich University of Strasbourg in the Alsace region of Occupied France. The collection was sanctioned by Himmler and under the direction of August Hirt. Ultimately 87 of the inmates were shipped to Natzweiler-Struthof and killed in August 1943.

5|$|Despite the {{opposition}} the Coffin family's {{desire to help}} the runaway slaves only increased. Coffin's wife, Catharine, who was also dedicated to the effort, organized a sewing society that met at their home to produce clothing {{to give to the}} runaways. She also provided meals and shelter to runaway slaves in the Coffin home. Other aid <b>was</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> neighbors and others sympathetic to the cause, but were unwilling take the fugitives into their homes. Through these activities Coffin was able to secure a steady supply of goods to assist in the ongoing operations.|$|E
5|$|Following most {{present day}} {{damaging}} earthquakes, teams of investigators from {{institutions such as}} the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute are sent to the affected region to set up instruments to capture strong motion records, and to study the damage and other effects of the event. This has not always been the case, and the 1954 report from Steinbrugge and Moran that thoroughly detailed the effects (especially to buildings) of the 1952 shocks put in place a model for how modern earthquake reconnaissance reports are written. The strong motion record that <b>was</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> the 1952 shock, as well as the accelerogram from the 1940 El Centro earthquake, were the most widely used data sets until the 1971 San Fernando earthquake.|$|E
5|$|In Paris it {{was planned}} that two stunt men, B.J. Worth and Don Caldvedt, would help film two takes of a {{parachute}} drop off a (clearly visible) platform that extended from a {{top edge of}} the Eiffel Tower. However, sufficient footage <b>was</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> Worth's jump, so Caldvedt was told {{he would not be}} performing his own jump. Caldvedt, unhappy at not being able to perform the jump, parachuted off the tower without authorisation from the City of Paris. He was subsequently sacked by the production team for jeopardising the continuation of filming in the city.|$|E

5|$|Māori quickly adopted {{writing as}} a means of sharing ideas, and many of their oral stories and poems were {{converted}} to the written form. Most early English literature <b>was</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> Britain and {{it was not until the}} 1950s when local publishing outlets increased that New Zealand literature started to become widely known. Although still largely influenced by global trends (modernism) and events (the Great Depression), writers in the 1930s began to develop stories increasingly focused on their experiences in New Zealand. During this period literature changed from a journalistic activity to a more academic pursuit. Participation in the world wars gave some New Zealand writers a new perspective on New Zealand culture and with the post-war expansion of universities local literature flourished. Dunedin is a UNESCO City of Literature.|$|E
5|$|NuScale {{was founded}} based on {{research}} funded by the Department of Energy from 2000 to 2003.

5|$|Several {{areas of}} Bath had {{undergone}} development during the Stuart period, and development increased during Georgian times {{in response to}} the increasing number of visitors to the spa and resort town who required accommodation. The architects John Wood, the Elder and his son John Wood, the Younger laid out the new quarters in streets and squares, the identical façades of which gave an impression of palatial scale and classical decorum. Much of the creamy gold Bath stone used for construction throughout the city <b>was</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> the limestone Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines, which were owned by Ralph Allen (1694–1764).|$|E

5|$|The Courthouse was {{designed}} by Jersey City native Hugh Roberts, twice {{a president of the}} New Jersey Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. Roberts, brother-in-law of future United States Senator and New Jersey Governor Edward I. Edwards, received a direct appointment as architect. No competition or bidding for designs was held, causing controversy among local architects. The property on which the courthouse stands <b>was</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> fourteen separate property owners between 1905 and 1914. The groundbreaking took place on March 21, 1906 and the cornerstone was laid on December 12, 1906. Construction of the building was done by Wells Brothers of New York City and construction of the interiors and finishes were by John Gill & Son of Cleveland, Ohio.|$|E

5|$|The {{commission}} for {{the brand new}} house of Knightshayes Court <b>was</b> <b>obtained</b> <b>from</b> Sir John Heathcoat-Amory in 1867 and the foundation stone was laid in 1869. By 1874, the building was still incomplete, owing to ongoing difficulties with Heathcoat-Amory, who objected to many of Burges's designs {{on the grounds of}} cost and of style. Although work had begun on the interior, the turbulent relationship between architect and client led to Burges's sacking in 1874 and his replacement by John Dibblee Crace. Nevertheless, Knightshayes Court remains the only example of a medium-sized Burges country house, built in a standard Victorian arrangement. Early French Gothic in style, it follows a standard neo-Tudor plan of a large central block with projecting gables. The tower Burges planned was never built.|$|E
