5|$|First rescue efforts {{came from}} {{surviving}} neighbours and co-workers <b>who</b> <b>pulled</b> and dug out victims from buildings. The initial informal response was soon joined by surviving policemen, firefighters and military personnel {{who began to}} arrive, as did anyone with a working vehicle; cars, trucks and delivery wagons of all kinds were enlisted to collect the wounded. A flood of victims soon began {{to arrive at the}} city's hospitals, which were quickly overwhelmed. The new military hospital, Camp Hill, admitted approximately 1400 victims on 6 December.|$|E
5|$|The hot {{and humid}} {{conditions}} in Nanning slowed the runners' pace and twelve of them remained within the main pack by the 10km point. The following five kilometres was decisive for the race, as Samuel Tsegay, Titus Masai and Mosop were all left trailing. The leading four runners were soon reduced to three, as Kipruto fell away to leave Zersenay Tadese, Wilson Kiprop and Sammy Kitwara to battle for the medal positions. Zersenay and Kiprop were neck and neck in the lead from the last kilometre and it was Kiprop <b>who</b> <b>pulled</b> away in the final 100metres to break the Eritrean's four-year undefeated streak. Zersenay faded badly {{at the end and}} appeared injured after taking second place. Kitwara and Kipruto were third and fourth, sealing the Kenyan team victory, while Samuel Tsegay's fifth place helped Eritrea to the team silver.|$|E
5|$|Magnussen made {{a second}} pit {{stop at the}} end of lap 16 for a {{steering-wheel}} change. On lap 17 Ricciardo went to the outside of Massa on the S-curves and moved inside, passing Massa to move into sixth. Rosberg was informed by team radio that more rain was expected within eight minutes. Vettel overtook Bottas around the outside for fourth place on the next lap. Bottas fell to fifth on the 19th lap, when Ricciardo passed him around the outside on the S-curves. Vettel began to reduce the time deficit to third-place Button, and Ricciardo was driving at a speed similar to his teammate. Bottas was caught by his Williams teammate Massa, <b>who</b> <b>pulled</b> away from Hülkenberg (who went off the track at the second turn). Both Red Bull drivers were the fastest by lap 21, but were 13 seconds behind Button and a further five seconds behind Rosberg (who, despite running off the track at 130R corner, had a shrinking one-second advantage over Hamilton). A dry line began to emerge by this time as some drivers drove through standing water to keep their tyre temperatures down.|$|E
40|$|The global {{financial}} and economic {{crisis of the}} late 2000 s highlights the ongoing tug-of-war between those <b>who</b> <b>pull</b> toward free markets and those <b>who</b> <b>pull</b> toward strict regulation of markets. It also highlights the sometimes parallel and sometimes perpendicular tug-of-war between those <b>who</b> <b>pull</b> toward libertarianism and those <b>who</b> <b>pull</b> toward paternalism. Rising stock markets and economic prosperity add power to those <b>who</b> <b>pull</b> toward free markets and libertarianism, and stock market crashes and economic recessions add power to those <b>who</b> <b>pull</b> toward strict regulation and paternalism. I discuss {{the crisis of the}} late 2000 s against the backdrop of earlier crises with special focus on margin regulations which limit leverage, suitability regulations which require providers of financial products to act in the interests of their clients, Blue Sky laws which prohibit securities deemed overly risky or unfair, and mandatory disclosure regulations which require providers of financial products to disclose pertinent information even if potential buyers do not ask for it.

5|$|More than 9.2 {{million people}} {{signed up for}} care on the {{national}} exchange (healthcare.gov) for 2017, down some 400,000 from 2016. This decline was due primarily to the election of President Trump, <b>who</b> <b>pulled</b> advertising encouraging people {{to sign up for}} coverage, issued an executive order that attempts to eliminate the mandate, and has created significant uncertainty {{about the future of the}} ACA. Enrollments had been running ahead of 2016 prior to President Obama leaving office, with 9.8 million expected to sign-up, so President Trump's actions potentially cost about 600,000 national enrollments (i.e., 9.8 million expected − 9.2 million actual = 0.6 million impact). Of the 9.2 million, 3.0 million were new customers and 6.2 million were returning. The 9.2 million excludes the 11 states that run their own exchanges, which have signed up around 3 million additional people. These figures also exclude the additional coverage due to the Medicaid expansion, which covers another approximately 10 million persons, as described in the impact section above.|$|E

25|$|In June 2015, Afriyie Akoto contested the {{constituency}} primary {{with the}} hope of securing enough votes to allow him to contest the constituency parliamentary election.

25|$|In {{the next}} five overs, England lost both Ian Bell, who notched up his third {{successive}} single-figure score, and Michael Vaughan, <b>who</b> <b>pulled</b> a short Gillespie delivery to the hands of Lee, but that did little to slow the scoring rate. 132 runs had been taken in the morning session; the afternoon yielded 157. Kevin Pietersen, in his second Test match, hit ten fours and one six, and made a 103-run partnership in 105 balls with Andrew Flintoff. Flintoff's 68 was scored off 62 balls, and Lee's 18 balls were taken for 26 runs, including two sixes.|$|E

Without players such as Barry Bonds, Vladimir Guerrero (<b>who</b> <b>pulled</b> out because three cousins {{died in a car}} {{accident}} right before World Baseball Classic), Manny Ramírez, Hideki Matsui, and José Vidro, some questioned whether the event would be credible. Cuba barred players such as Orlando Hernández, his half-brother Liván Hernández, and José Contreras, from its team as Cubans who had previously defected. Additionally, Italy utilized a roster of players made up almost entirely of second-generation Italian Americans such as Mike Piazza.|$|E
25|$|Klitschko was {{scheduled}} to face David Haye, <b>who</b> <b>pulled</b> out within weeks of the fight complaining of a back injury. Salvaging 20 June 2009 date and venue, Klitschko instead retained the IBF, WBO and IBO Heavyweight titles and also won the vacant Ring magazine heavyweight title by defeating replacement opponent and Ring No. 3 ranked Ruslan Chagaev when Chagaev retired after an onslaught of punches {{towards the end of}} the ninth round. There was a total of 61,000 fans in attendance at the Veltins Arena. As Chagaev was WBA Champion, the title was not on the line.|$|E
25|$|England {{lost both}} Ian Bell, who {{continued}} his relatively poor Ashes series with his third successive single-figure score, and Michael Vaughan, <b>who</b> <b>pulled</b> a short Gillespie delivery to {{the hands of}} Lee, {{in the space of}} the next five overs, but still pounded on. Kevin Pietersen, in his second Test match, hit 10 fours and one six, and forged a 103-run partnership in 105 balls with Andrew Flintoff, which turned the match back to England's favour. Flintoff's 68 was scored quickly, including five sixes, and again Lee got the most stick – he was taken for 26 in the 18 balls he faced.|$|E

It also saw a major increase in viewership numbers from the third season finale and surpassing the third season premiere. The show placed third in its timeslot, and sixth for the night.|$|E

According to Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, before shooting Disario, Hartless had taken two people hostage over an hour before to conceal his presence. Hartless and Disario engaged in a shootout that left Disario fatally wounded, while the two hostages escaped unharmed. Disario was found by responding deputies <b>who</b> <b>pulled</b> him to safety.
