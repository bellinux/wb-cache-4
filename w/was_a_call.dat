5|$|A {{central theme}} of President Obama's inaugural address <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> to restore responsibility—both in terms of {{accountability}} in Washington and the responsibility of ordinary people to get involved. Obama's address did not have memorable sound bite phrases. Instead, he used traditional references to connect his new administration with the nation's history in a speech that was understated deliberately, according to rhetoric expert James Mackin.|$|E
5|$|There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> for {{automated}} transponders {{after the}} 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks; no changes were made, as aviation experts preferred flexible control, {{in case of}} malfunctions or electrical emergencies. In the wake of Flight 370, the air transport industry was still resistant to the installation of automated transponders, which would likely entail significant costs. Pilots also criticised changes of this kind, insisting {{on the need to}} cut power to equipment {{in the event of a}} fire. Nonetheless, new types of tamper-proof circuit breakers were being considered.|$|E
5|$|Vainio's {{childhood}} {{heart problems}} surfaced again in 1990 {{with his sister}} Marja recalling that he often placed {{his hand over his}} heart. He had even finished writing his will. At one time Vainio was travelling to Florida with his friend, composer Veikko Samuli. Vainio {{had to go to the}} bathroom during the flight, and soon there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> for a doctor from the flight crew. Vainio had kept his heart medicines in his pocket, where the box had opened and mixed with his pastilles. Vainio had eaten too much of the medicine by accident, and his heartbeat started to slow down. Once a stewardess found out what had happened, she saved Vainio's life by quickly forcing him to vomit.|$|E

5|$|Following Chicken Fries' discontinuation, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> for the product's {{reinstatement}} {{from fans}} of the product on forums such as Reddit; Business Insider noted that {{they are one of}} the 17 most requested fast products that people would like to see returned to menus. Fans of the product also established several social media accounts dedicated to Chicken Fries' return on Facebook, Twitter, and Tumblr. Additionally, a Change.org petition was created that called on Burger King to reinstate the product to its menu. Perez Hilton's web site declared that Chicken Fries are one product of many that will never come back, while comedian Daniel Tosh featured a skit during one of the segments of his show, Tosh.0, to the product's return. They were re-released in August 2014 as a limited time offering (LTO). The return of the product met with a favorable reaction from those who were advocating for Chicken Fries to return to the Burger King menu. There was disappointment from these groups as well because of the product's status as a limited time offering. In March 2015, Burger King permanently re-added Chicken Fries to the menu in a large, international menu expansion in thirty countries.|$|E

25|$|Following the war, the {{political}} energies {{of the newly}} independent states were focused on forming “a more perfect union,” first in the Articles of Confederation, later in the Constitution of the United States of America. The newly independent daughter churches of the Church of England also sought “a more perfect union,” and foremost in the leadership was the same Abraham Beach. In the winter of 1783/84 he corresponded with William White (later the first Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church) and other clergy in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and New York soliciting a gathering to “consider {{the state of the}} church.” He extended an invitation to meet at Christ Church May 11, 1784. The outgrowth of that meeting <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> for another meeting in October 1784 with representatives from all thirteen states to consider a general convention to manage the affairs of the newly independent church. The First General Convention met in September 1785, leading to the current shape of the church we now know: with equal voice and vote for bishops, clergy and laity, the beginnings of an American Book of Common Prayer, and our own national Constitution and Canons.|$|E
25|$|In January 1958, {{soon after}} the death of Shoghi Effendi in November, another {{intercontinental}} conference was held in Kampala and attended by his widow Ruhiyyih Khanum. Though sorrowful at his death, there <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> to service in honor of his service. The conference had been initially planned for less than 400 attendees and was overwhelmed as news of over 300 Persians alone were coming. Ultimately some 950 Bahá'ís, six Hands of the Cause, a member of the International Bahá'í Council, sixteen Auxiliary Board members, and representatives from eleven national spiritual assemblies (including those from the four African regional assemblies, those from the other national assemblies which had participated in campaign to bring the religion to sub-Saharan Africa - Britain, India, Iraq, Persia, and the United States - and those from Arabia and Japan), 450 African members, over 300 from Persia, two Knights of Bahá'u'lláh (one from the Pacific and one from the Arctic), and others from rest of the world were present at the formal convening of the conference as well as telegrams received from many other Hands of the Cause and 34 national assemblies arrived. Reportedly every hotel room was booked. Ruhiyyih Khanum anointed most attendees with Attar of rose before being admitted into a viewing of relics of Bahá'u'lláh as well as a reproduction of a painting of him {{on the first day of}} the conference. Viewings were also held of a large map by Shoghi Effendi showing the progress of the religion, films of Shrines and gardens from the Bahá'í World Center, as it existed then, as well as the Monument on the grave of Shoghi Effendi. Some $280,000 was raised at the conference from a segment of the attendees for donation to the progress of the religion. The foundation stone for the Mother Temple of Africa was laid and relics in silk bags made by Bahiyyih Khánum were set in place (planned to be under the wall on that side of the Temple facing out across a grassy valley towards the Bahá'í Qiblih.) Ruhiyyih Khanum then spent a day among the Tseo people - speaking to school groups, receiving guests, and visiting homes. She donated money for the reconstruction of a center that had been lost.|$|E
500|$|When Alexander {{set out for}} Asia, he {{left his}} general Antipater, an {{experienced}} military and political leader and part of Philip II's [...] "Old Guard", in charge of Macedon. Alexander's sacking of Thebes ensured that Greece remained quiet during his absence. The one exception <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> to arms by Spartan king Agis III in 331BC, whom Antipater defeated and killed {{in the battle of}} Megalopolis. Antipater referred the Spartans' punishment to the League of Corinth, which then deferred to Alexander, who chose to pardon them. There was also considerable friction between Antipater and Olympias, and each complained to Alexander about the other.|$|E

500|$|Conflicts {{between the}} two {{countries}} began to develop again during the lead-up to the 2015 contest, where allegations emerged that the Armenian entry, [...] "Don't Deny", <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> for recognition of the Armenian Genocide (whose 100th anniversary was commemorated prior to the 2015 contest). As Azerbaijan denies the genocide, officials from the country issued a statement threatening Armenia for attempting to use Eurovision as an outlet for its [...] "political ambitions". The song was subsequently renamed [...] "Face the Shadow" [...] to address concerns over its alleged political themes. The following year, Armenian representative Iveta Mukuchyan was reprimanded by organizers for displaying the flag of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic during the first semi-final.|$|E
500|$|The Christian {{element of}} the album was most obvious in the hymn-like [...] "Word on a Wing", though for some {{commentators}} religion, like love, was simply another way for the Duke to [...] "test his numbness". Bowie himself has claimed that in this song, at least, [...] "the passion is genuine". When performing it live in 1999, the singer described it as coming from [...] "the darkest days of my life... I'm sure that it <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> for help". The closing ballad, [...] "Wild Is the Wind", was the album's sole cover, and has been praised {{as one of the}} finest vocal performances of Bowie's career. Bowie was inspired to record it after he met singer/pianist/songwriter Nina Simone (whose version is on the eponymous 1966 album).|$|E
500|$|Among {{the matters}} before the new, Tillman-controlled {{legislature}} was who should fill the Senate seat held by Hampton, whose term expired in March 1891—until 1913, state legislatures elected senators. There <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>call</b> from {{many in the}} South Carolina Democratic Party to re-elect Hampton, who had {{played a major role}} in the state for the past thirty years, in war and peace. Tillman was embittered against Hampton for a number of slights, including the senator's neutrality in the race against Haskell. The legislature retired Hampton, who received only 43 of 157 votes, and sent Irby to Washington in his place. The ouster of Hampton was controversial, and remained so for decades afterwards; according to Simkins (writing in 1944), [...] "to future generations of South Carolinians, Tillman's act was a ruthless violation of cherished traditions of which Hampton was a living symbol".|$|E
