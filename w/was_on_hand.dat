5|$|A {{team from}} Argonne <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> for {{powering}} {{up the first}} reactor at the Hanford Site, where large reactors would produce plutonium for bombs. They watched the reactor in shifts, with John Marshall {{and others on the}} day shift, Enrico Fermi and Leona Marshall on the night shift, ending at midnight, and Don Hughes and John Wheeler on the swing shift. While the Marshalls were babysitting the reactor in Hanford, they left Peter with Leona's mother.|$|E
5|$|On 8 June 2006, {{during the}} lead-up to the 2006 FIFA World Cup, an {{information}} board was installed {{to mark the}} location of the Führerbunker.

5|$|The Sounds' home opener, {{scheduled}} for April 25, was rained out and pushed back to April 26. After playing their first ten games away from home, and with tractors and grading machines still preparing {{the field on}} game day, the Sounds played their first home game at Herschel Greer Stadium on April 26, 1978. The 12–4victory against the Savannah Braves was witnessed by a sellout crowd of 8,156 spectators. Southern League president Billy Hitchcock <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> to witness the event, and Conway Twitty threw out the first pitch.|$|E
5|$|When the {{air-cooled}} X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge went critical on 4 November 1943, Fermi <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> just in {{case something}} went wrong. The technicians woke him early {{so that he could}} see it happen. Getting X-10 operational was another milestone in the plutonium project. It provided data on reactor design, training for DuPont staff in reactor operation, and produced the first small quantities of reactor-bred plutonium. Fermi became an American citizen in July 1944, the earliest date the law allowed.|$|E
5|$|A {{successful}} Allied {{offensive in}} May finally {{broke through the}} Gustav Line, and Rome fell to Clark's army on 4 June. On 13 June, Devers ordered Larkin to shift priority for supplies from Fifth Army in Italy to Seventh Army. Two days later, Wilson ordered VI Corps to be withdrawn from the front line in preparation for Anvil. Virtually all the material needed for the assault <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand,</b> on the way, or promised, thanks to Devers' efforts to preserve the stockpile of Anvil stores and supplies even when the operation was in doubt. To command the assault, he created a special headquarters on Corsica called Advanced Detachment AFHQ, with Devers in command.|$|E

5|$|A {{week after}} Vancouver's Game 7 loss, Henrik <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> at the NHL Awards Ceremony in Las Vegas, having been {{nominated}} along with Daniel for the NHL Foundation Player Award for their charitable work. They lost the award to Los Angeles Kings captain Dustin Brown. For his regular season efforts, Henrik {{was named to}} the NHL First All-Star Team for a second consecutive year, alongside Daniel, who earned the distinction for the first time. Returning to Sweden in the off-season, Henrik and Daniel were co-recipients of the Victoria Scholarship as the country's athletes of the year. They became the third and fourth ice hockey players to receive the award, after Stefan Persson in 1980 and Peter Forsberg in 1994. Henrik and Daniel were presented the award, commemorated with glass plates, on 14 July 2011, in the city of Borgholm.|$|E
5|$|As {{it moved}} into {{position}} around Bardia in December 1940, the 6th Division was still experiencing shortages. It {{had only two}} of its three artillery regiments, and only the 2/1st Field Regiment was equipped with the new 25-pounders, which it had received only that month. The 2/2nd Field Regiment was still equipped with twelve 18-pounders and twelve 4.5-inchhowitzers. Only A Squadron of the 2/6th Cavalry Regiment <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand,</b> {{as the rest of}} the regiment was deployed in the defence of the frontier posts at Al-Jaghbub and Siwa Oasis. The 2/1st Machine Gun Battalion had been diverted to Britain. Its place was taken by a British Army machine-gun battalion, the 1st Northumberland Fusiliers. The 2/1st Antitank Regiment had likewise been diverted, so each infantry brigade had formed an antitank company but 2-pounders were in short supply, and only eleven guns were available instead of the 27 required. The infantry battalions were particularly short of mortars, and ammunition for the Boys anti-tank rifle was in short supply.|$|E
5|$|Fairley's {{proposed}} use of atebrin as a prophylactic {{agent was}} accepted and Fairley switched the Australian Army over to using atebrin as a prophylaxis instead of quinine in March 1943. The most acute problem {{at this time}} was a shortage of atebrin. The Australian Army had only seven weeks' stock <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> in March 1943 and US forces in both the South West Pacific and South Pacific Area were drawing on Australian Army stocks as they had not yet received adequate stocks of their own. The drug is also a dye, and had the known side effect of making the skin and eyeballs of the user go yellow in colour after repeated use but this was an acceptable drawback in wartime. Prolonged use could cause lichen planus and psychosis in rare cases, but atebrin still {{turned out to be}} much safer than quinine. Blackwater fever—which had a mortality rate of 25%—disappeared entirely.|$|E

5|$|In 1976, {{the fire}} {{department}} moved to Fire Station #6 with the bulb; the bulb socket's cord was severed for fear that unscrewing the bulb could damage it. It was deprived of electricity for only 22 minutes during the transfer, which was made in a specially designed box and with full firetruck escort. An electrician <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> to install the bulb into the new fire station's emergency generator. Ripley's Believe It Or Not stated that the short delay would not mar the bulb's continuous burning record. In 2001, the bulb's 100th birthday was celebrated with a community barbecue and live music. Since that move, the bulb has run continuously for 38 years; previously it had only been off the grid for {{short periods of time}} (e.g. a week in 1937 for a renovation and the odd power outage).|$|E
5|$|Mardonius {{moved to}} break the stalemate, by {{offering}} peace, self-government and territorial expansion to the Athenians (with the aim of thereby removing their fleet from the Allied forces), using Alexander I of Macedon as an intermediary. The Athenians made sure that a Spartan delegation <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> to hear the offer, but rejected it. Athens was thus evacuated again, and the Persians marched south and re-took possession of it. Mardonius now repeated his offer of peace to the Athenian refugees on Salamis. Athens, along with Megara and Plataea, sent emissaries to Sparta demanding assistance, and threatening to accept the Persian terms if not. The Spartans, who were at that time celebrating the festival of Hyacinthus, delayed making a decision for 10 days. However, when the Athenian emissaries then delivered an ultimatum to the Spartans, they were amazed to hear that a task force was in fact already marching to meet the Persians.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{following}} weekend, some 1,000 volunteers were sworn-in {{as part of}} the Citizens' Defence Brigade, a force of special constables raised at Leane's request to augment the police in dealing with the waterfront dispute. The brigade was based at Fort Largs and was equipped with service rifles and bayonets. The men were quickly posted at the wharves to maintain law and order. During the dispute, Leane slept in an office at the port so that he <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> to deal with any emergencies. Leane's decision to arm the mostly inexperienced volunteers with bayonets was later criticised in Parliament. The dispute continued on, with major disturbances at Port Adelaide on 14 January 1929 which resulted in many injuries, and another on 17 January. A significant police presence was required at the wharves into 1930 to deal with disturbances and assaults on non-union workers, and Leane personally supervised police operations there on several occasions.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps Simpson's {{most ambitious}} project was the laying of a {{submarine}} cable between Cape York and New Guinea. A cable laying ship, the SS Mernoo, was chartered, and two old cables that {{ran across the}} Bass Strait were lifted and re-laid across the Torres Strait in October 1943. When the land connections were completed in December 1943, it became possible {{to send a message}} all the way from Melbourne to Port Moresby. Simpson, who was on an inspection tour of New Guinea, <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> for the receipt of the first message. In November 1944, he visited the front in the Netherlands, Belgium and France, returning to Australia via the United States and Canada.|$|E
5|$|President Roosevelt {{personally}} visited Kentucky {{to campaign}} on Barkley's behalf on July 8, 1938. As {{governor of the}} state, Chandler <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> to greet Roosevelt on his arrival in Covington. Seeking to benefit from being nearest to the president, Chandler sat between Roosevelt and Barkley {{in the back seat}} of the open-topped vehicle that transported them to Latonia Race Track, the site of Roosevelt's first speech. Throughout his tour of the state, Roosevelt endorsed Barkley while remaining friendly with Chandler; after Roosevelt's departure, Chandler played up Roosevelt's complimentary remarks about him while downplaying or ignoring critical remarks.|$|E
5|$|A {{crowd of}} 43,167 people <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>hand</b> {{to watch the}} Browns play the Bills, Buffalo's biggest-ever home {{attendance}} figure. Cleveland scored a touchdown {{in each of the}} game's four quarters, winning 28–7. The first score followed several completions by Graham that set up a 12-yard touchdown run by Jones. In the second period, Cleveland tied a professional football record when Graham, pinned at his own one-yard line, threw a screen pass to Speedie. Speedie caught the ball and ran for a 99-yard touchdown, setting an AAFC record and tying the National Football League record for longest completed pass. The Browns scored again in the third quarter on a diving catch by Lavelli, who rolled into the end zone, and in the fourth quarter on a pass to John Yonakor. Buffalo scored its only points in the fourth period when George Ratterman connected with Al Baldwin for the quarterback's 16th touchdown of the season. Graham threw 13 completions for 246 yards as passing accounted for most of the team's 392 yards of total offense. Cleveland's defense was also strong, preventing the Bills from scoring on several drives that ventured deep into Browns territory. The win was the eighth for Cleveland in nine games and preserved its spot {{at the top of the}} AAFC standings.|$|E
