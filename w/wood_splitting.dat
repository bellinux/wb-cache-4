50|$|Sometimes <b>wood</b> <b>{{splitting}}</b> is undesirable. Methods {{to prevent}} splitting in woodworking are the butterfly joint, truss connector plates, or metal straps. Columns may be hollowed {{in the center}} to prevent splitting. Nail points may be blunted or pilot holes drilled to prevent splitting of lumber while nailing or screwing. End grain sealers are liquid products usually containing wax which helps prevent rapid drying of the ends of lumber resulting in splits. Metal end plates or S-shaped pieces of metal may be driven into the butt ends of a timber. Splitting is the primary reason building codes do not allow notching {{in the bottom of}} joists and beams.|$|E
50|$|Most {{firewood}} {{also requires}} splitting, which {{also allows for}} faster seasoning by exposing more surface area. Today most splitting is done with a hydraulic splitting machine, {{but it can also}} be split with a splitting maul. More unusual, and dangerous, is a tapered screw-style design, that augers into the <b>wood,</b> <b>splitting</b> it, and can be powered by either a power take-off drive, a dedicated internal combustion engine, or a rugged electric pipe-threading machine, which is safer than the other power sources because the power can be shut off more easily if necessary. Another method is to use a kinetic log splitter, which uses a rack and pinion system powered by a small motor and a large flywheel used for energy storage.|$|E
50|$|The hammer {{side of the}} maul {{is often}} used in <b>wood</b> <b>splitting</b> when {{combined}} with a splitting wedge, driving the wedge into the wood {{in the same fashion}} as the maul itself. This is generally used when attempting to split logs with a large diameter. Modern mauls are made of a strong enough steel to withstand the metal-to-metal contact without chipping. However, it is still common for the wedge itself to chip off. This can be dangerous as flying chips of steel could damage the eye. This is also the easiest way to break a maul's handle because the wedge is a very small target as opposed to the whole log, and can be overshot, resulting in the handle hitting full-force onto the wedge. This greatly weakens the handle, and can cause it to break after only a few over-shots.|$|E

5000|$|Wedged mauls: A typical <b>wood</b> <b>splitting</b> maul has a head {{weight of}} 6 to 8 lb or {{approximately}} 2.7 to 3.6 kg, respectively. Traditionally, mauls have a wedge-shaped head, but some modern versions have conical heads or swiveling sub-wedges. The original maul resembles an axe {{but with a}} broader head. For splitting wood, this tool {{is much better than}} a typical axe. The weight of it is more advantageous and due to its width, it is less likely to become stuck in the wood. The wedge section of a maul head must be slightly convex to avoid jamming and it cannot have the elongated [...] "hollow ground" [...] concave-section that a cutting axe may use. Unlike an axe, maul handles are normally straight and closer to round than the elongated oval axe handles tend to be. A maul's handle, unlike an axe, is intentionally used for levering as well as swinging. The handles are typically made from hickory, though synthetic fibreglass handles have become common. Plastic handles are more difficult to break and their factory-attached heads are less likely to work free with the levering action of a maul. In the early 1970s a triangular head design with an unbreakable metal handle was introduced called the [...] "Monster Maul." ...|$|E

30|$|A {{three-dimensional}} finite {{solid element}} model for Japanese traditional post-and-beam connections was developed using the wood foundation method, which employed {{the concept of}} a beam on a nonlinear foundation. The wood foundation in the model was a three-dimensionally prescribed zone surrounding a nail shank in order to address the intricate wood crushing behavior induced by nail slip. Material models for the wood members and the foundation were developed based on the transversely isotropic plasticity from the software package ANSYS. The Japanese post-and-beam connection modeled was a ten-nail multiple connection with a mortise and tenon joint and is called the CPT (Corner Plate, T-shaped) connection. Details of the model development are presented. As a feasibility study, blind predictions of the model were compared with available connection test data and showed good results for predicting the progress of the load-deformation relations in three dimensions. However, the limitation of the model was found in simulating fracture failures such as <b>wood</b> <b>splitting</b> or nail tear-out from the wood. Model applications and the need for model improvement are discussed.|$|E
40|$|The {{strength}} and fracture behavior of dowel-type connections with stiff dowels loaded perpendicular to grain was studied by nonlinear 3 D finite element (FE) -analysis. A cohesive zone model {{was used to}} model the perpendicular to grain fracture of the wood, i. e., failure by <b>wood</b> <b>splitting</b> along the grain. The influence of load eccentricity and dowel-to-loaded-edge distance was studied for a plate type of geometry loaded in tension and for a simply supported beam loaded in bending. The strength found from the FE-analysis is compared to strength from experimental tests with centric loading, showing overall good agreement. Numerical results for centric loading are further compared to strength predictions according to the linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) -based design criterion present in Eurocode 5 (EN 1995 - 1 - 1 : 2004). The comparison showed good agreement regarding the relative influence of connection geometry, but the design criterion appears, however, to yield unconservative strength predictions. The results of the FE-analyses regarding dowel load eccentricity showed that such loading conditions may yield significantly lower strengths compared to centric loading. An approximate engineering method {{to account for the}} strength reduction due to load eccentricity is, furthermore, presented...|$|E

40|$|A skilled woodsman quickly reduces a large tree to {{manageable}} pieces.

Even seasoned woodcutters should revise techniques that are hazardous. One analysis of chain saw accidents revealed that 70 percent of those injured {{had more than one}} year’s experience. To avoid injuries, possibly even death, practice safe woodcutting while clearing, thinning, cutting firewood or cleaning up trees downed by a storm. A hard hat to protect your head from falling limbs or branches. The best helmets have a face guard. Safety glasses or goggles to prevent injury from flying wood chips.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the RC {{aircraft}} design was not to address a problem {{that has not been}} solved, but to redesign an aircraft with the intent to understand the practical applications of the building process. Our approach to completing this project involved two phases; the planning phase and the building phase. In the planning phase, we made selections for the airfoil, wing, fuselage, tail, elevators, and ailerons. These choices were made using aeronautical engineering concepts and theory. For the building phase, we focused on materials selection, fabrication, and testing. During our design process, a lot of time went to choosing the airfoil. While researching, we considered three governing factors: drag coefficient, lift coefficient, and manufacturability. Each airfoil offered a variation of these parameters. The Eppler 423 airfoil was picked for its low drag coefficient. There were issues during fabrication. These issues mainly stemmed from the lack of quality equipment. For example, initial attempts to cut the balsa wood into the airfoil profile caused <b>wood</b> <b>splitting.</b> This happened because the saw was too coarse for that grain of wood. If this project were redone, we would utilize tools that are commonly used within the hobbyist community to optimize fabrication. Our project focused on the application of the engineering design process that we have become familiar with as undergraduate students. In terms of purpose, our project would identify most with the R/C aircraft hobbyist community and FSAE community that also engineer and build aircrafts for personal or competition uses. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental and numerical study into {{the response of}} bolted connections between Glulam timber beams and tubular steel columns. Six specimens involving two different connection types subjected to monotonically increasing bending action are examined. The first connection type incorporates top and seat angles blind-bolted to the column and jointed to the beam through long bolts. The second connection type is formed by a steel T-stub slotted into the timber beam and connected to it by means of transverse bolts. In addition, two reinforcing techniques aimed at enhancing {{the response of the}} slotted-in T-stub configuration are investigated. These include the provision of a bottom wedge angle between the beam and the column as well as the use of perpendicular-to-grain screws to delay <b>wood</b> <b>splitting.</b> The experimental set-up, connection configurations and material properties are introduced followed by a detailed account of the test results and observations. The main behavioural patterns are identified from the experiments and key response characteristics such as stiffness, capacity and failure mechanism are discussed. This paper shows that the use of bottom wedge angles leads to significant enhancement in the flexural yield strength of the T-stub connections, accompanied by a relatively small change in the location of the bolt-group point of rotation (monitored herein by means of Digital Image Correlation techniques). Besides, the use of reinforcing screws is shown to be an effective detail for substantially increasing the rotational ductility of the connections. Finite element simulations of the tests are also presented, together with {{a detailed description of the}} modelling approaches employed, in order to gain further insight into the behaviour of the connections. Finally, the applicability of simplified component-based expressions, which are suitable for practical design assessment procedures, for the estimation of the stiffness and capacity of the proposed hybrid glulam-to-tubular column connections are presented and discussed...|$|E
