5|$|During the mid-1930s, Highway28 was {{extended}} {{as far north}} as Apsley. This <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> assuming existing Peterborough County roads along the Otonabee River as far as Burleigh Falls, via Lakefield. North of there, the department assumed the Burleigh Falls Road. Highway28 {{was extended}} from Peterborough to Burleigh Falls on April4, 1934.|$|E
5|$|In {{one shot}} Guinness appears as seven of his {{characters}} at {{once in a}} single frame. This <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> masking the lens.

5|$|After {{the branch}} north of Fort Totten opened, the Green Line Commuter Shortcut {{began as a}} six-month {{experiment}} on January 27, 1997, allowing passengers {{to get on a}} train on the Green Line segment during rush hours and travel as far as Farragut North on the Red Line without having to switch trains at Fort Totten; a transfer was needed during off-peak hours. This <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> utilizing a single-track spur (B & E connection) between the Green and Red Lines near (and bypassing) Fort Totten station. This shortcut was so well-received that it was continued until September 17, 1999, when the mid-city portion of the Green Line was completed.|$|E
5|$|Another aspect {{that the}} GAO {{investigation}} revealed {{was that the}} training F-15 pilots received for identifying helicopters was not adequate. Visual ID training <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> reviewing slides on a 35mm projector. Helicopters only made up about 5% of the training slides and nearly all the pictures depicted helicopters from the ground looking up because the pictures were provided by the U.S. Army. Investigators also learned from interviewing other F-15 pilots that helicopter recognition was not regarded as an important skill within the F-15 pilot community because helicopters are not considered a threat to F-15s in air-to-air combat.|$|E
5|$|At the park's visitor center, {{the group}} learns that the cloning <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> extracting dinosaur DNA from {{mosquitoes}} {{that had been}} preserved in amber. DNA from frogs was used to fill in gaps in the dinosaur genomes. To prevent breeding, all the dinosaurs were made female. Malcolm scoffs {{at the idea of}} such controlled breeding, declaring it will inevitably break down. The crew witness the birth of a baby raptor and visit the raptor enclosure. During a luncheon, the group debates the ethics of cloning and the creation of the park, with Dr. Malcolm giving a harsh warning about the implications of genetic engineering as a whole.|$|E

5|$|Effective in the 2014 racing season, the {{grandstand}} capacity was reduced from 92,000 to 68,000. This <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> removing approximately 12,000 seats near Turn 1 and installing a hospitality {{area and a}} digital display showing speeds along the straightaway. In addition, seats were further reduced {{as a result of}} modifying average seat width from 18 inches to 23 inches. The capacity quoted does not include luxury boxes and infield seating, which when added up reaches a capacity of approximately 100,000.|$|E
5|$|The Fat Man and Pumpkin bombs (non-nuclear {{bombs that}} resembled and handled like Fat Man) weighed over , so weight was a concern, {{even with the}} more {{powerful}} engines. Weight reduction <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> removal of all gun turrets and armor plating. This work {{was done by the}} 509th Composite Group for the early Silverplate aircraft, but later models were delivered without them. These B-29s represented a significant increase in performance over the standard variants.|$|E

5|$|The towers were {{designed}} as framed tube structures, giving tenants open floor plans, unobstructed by columns or walls. This design <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> using many closely spaced perimeter columns, providing {{much of the}} structure's strength, with the gravity load shared with the core columns. The elevator system, which made use of sky lobbies and a system of express and local elevators, allowed substantial floor space {{to be used for}} office purposes by making the structural core smaller. The design and construction of the towers involved many other innovative techniques, such as wind tunnel experiments and the slurry wall for digging the foundation.|$|E
5|$|According to the Moscow Defence Brief, an English-language {{magazine}} {{published by}} the Russian non-governmental organisation the Centre for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, the Georgian troops included the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Infantry Brigades, the Artillery Brigade, part of the 1st Infantry Brigade and the separate Gori Tank Battalion. Additionally, special forces and Ministry of Internal Affairs troops were deployed. The total number of troops was 16,000 according to the magazine. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, ten light infantry battalions of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th infantry brigades, special forces and an artillery brigade, totalling approximately 12,000 troops, had been concentrated {{by the start of}} the conflict. The primary task of capturing Tskhinvali <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> the 4th Brigade with support from the 2nd and 3rd Brigades. According to the EU fact-finding mission, 10,000–11,000 soldiers took part in the war.|$|E
5|$|Basin and Range-associated {{stretching}} {{of large}} parts of crust below southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico started around 16millionyears ago and the region is still spreading. This stretching began to affect the Death and Panamint valleys area by 3million years ago. Before this, rocks now in the Panamint Range were on top of rocks that would become the Black Mountains and the Cottonwood Mountains. Lateral and vertical transport of these blocks <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> movement on normal faults. Right-lateral movement along strike-slip faults that run parallel to and {{at the base of}} the ranges also helped to develop the area. Torsional forces, probably associated with northwesterly movement of the Pacific Plate along the San Andreas Fault (west of the region), is responsible for the lateral movement.|$|E

5|$|By late 1461, risings in {{the north}} had been put down, and {{in the summer of}} 1462, Warwick {{negotiated}} a truce with Scotland. In October the same year, Margaret of Anjou invaded England with troops from France, and managed to take the castles of Alnwick and Bamburgh. Warwick had to organise the recapture of the castles, which <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> January 1463. The leaders of the rebellion, including Sir Ralph Percy, were pardoned and left in charge of the retaken castles. At this point, Warwick felt secure enough to travel south; in February he buried the remains of his father and brother at Bisham Priory, and in March he attended parliament at Westminster.|$|E
5|$|In the {{prevailing}} Standard Model of physics, the photon {{is one of}} four gauge bosons in the electroweak interaction; the other three are denoted W+, W− and Z0 and are responsible for the weak interaction. Unlike the photon, these gauge bosons have mass, owing to a mechanism that breaks their SU(2) gauge symmetry. The unification of the photon with W and Z gauge bosons in the electroweak interaction <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg, for which they were awarded the 1979 Nobel Prize in physics. Physicists continue to hypothesize grand unified theories that connect these four gauge bosons with the eight gluon gauge bosons of quantum chromodynamics; however, key predictions of these theories, such as proton decay, have not been observed experimentally.|$|E
5|$|It {{was common}} for Christie to greet a {{returning}} submarine at the pier, and to award decorations {{to the crew}} on the spot. This bypassed naval award boards, and annoyed Kinkaid and Lockwood, possibly because confirmation of sinkings <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> Ultra, the reading of coded Japanese radio traffic, and news of awards given so quickly could constitute a security breach. Complicating the matter was the fact MacArthur awarded army decorations to naval personnel; like Christie, he {{took it upon himself}} to authorize the decorations rather than to go through the standard review procedures. These events compelled Kinkaid to forbid Christie to give pierside awards, and to keep Christie from recommending the award of army medals to navy personnel. These events would ultimately contribute to Christie's dismissal as Commander of Submarines in Fremantle.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1170, de Broc was {{involved}} {{in an attempt to}} keep Becket from returning to England. Working with de Broc were Roger de Pont L'Évêque– the Archbishop of York, Gilbert Foliot– the Bishop of London, Josceline de Bohon– the Bishop of Salisbury, Gervase de Cornhill– the Sheriff of Kent, and Reginald de Warenne. De Broc was part of the party that met Becket at Sandwich on 1 December 1070 when the archbishop returned to England. The group, led by Gervase of Cornhill, complained that Becket was sowing dissension in the land by his excommunication of the Archbishop of York and the Bishops of London and Salisbury, but Becket managed to calm the officials by stating he would consider the matter and reply to them the next day. The next day the group was accompanied by some clergy sent by the three excommunicated ecclesiastics, but nothing <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> this meeting except further offers from Becket to consider other options.|$|E
5|$|Project M {{first began}} as a {{development}} project to rework the character Falco to play like he did in Melee. The designers' goal {{at the time was}} for the game to be accessible to newcomers and encourage people to get better at the game, which <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> creating a character roster that is more balanced. The mod's first demo was announced on January 15, 2011, with a release date of late January or early February in time for the Pound 5 tournament, where it was featured. It featured 14 of the 39 characters in Brawl, as well as new stages Brawl had not included. It was later given a solid date of February 7, 2011. A patch was later created to fix the demo's bugs and fine-tune the player's control of their movement direction after being attacked.|$|E
5|$|The {{removal of}} the sword from the coinage hub, which had already been {{produced}} by reduction from the plaster models, <b>was</b> <b>accomplished</b> <b>by</b> painstaking work by Mint Chief Engraver Morgan, using extremely fine engraving tools under magnification. Morgan did the work on December 23 {{in the presence of}} de Francisci, who had been summoned to the Philadelphia Mint to ensure the work met with his approval. It was insufficient merely to remove the sword, {{as the rest of the}} design had to be adjusted. Morgan had to hide the excision; he did so by extending the olive branch, previously half-hidden by the sword, but had to remove a small length of stem that showed to the left of the eagle's talons. Morgan also strengthened the rays, and sharpened the appearance of the eagle's leg. The chief engraver did his work with such skill that the work on the dollar was not known for over 85years.|$|E
