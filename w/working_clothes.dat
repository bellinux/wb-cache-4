Instead of returning to Erdington, Ashford announced that {{she would go to}} her grandfather's house, stating that it was closer to work. This was true, but ignored the fact {{that she would have to}} return to Erdington to obtain her <b>working</b> <b>clothes</b> in the morning. Cox journeyed to Erdington, while Ashford and Thornton went off together. At about a quarter to three, a labourer saw Thornton leaving a friend's house with a woman, and greeted Thornton, but the woman (undoubtedly Ashford) held her bonnet over her face. Just before 4a.m., Cox was awakened by Ashford, seeking her <b>working</b> <b>clothes.</b> Ashford changed and hurried off, stating that she needed to be home before her uncle left for market. A returning reveller from Tyburn House saw her walking quickly. He was the last person known to see her alive.|$|E

He was forced to resign after a bicycle mishap tore his only <b>working</b> <b>clothes.</b> Following a spell of unemployment, he joined the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army (KNIL) in June 1940, and undertook basic training in Gombong near Yogyakarta. With the Netherlands under German occupation and the Japanese pressing for access to Indonesian oil supplies, the Dutch had opened up the KNIL to large intakes of previously excluded Javanese. Suharto was assigned to Battalion XIII at Rampal, graduated from a short training course at KNIL Kaderschool in Gombong to become a sergeant, and was posted to a KNIL reserve battalion in Cisarua.|$|E
5|$|From the 1840s onwards more mines {{provided}} crude shelters {{to protect}} surface {{workers from the}} worst of the weather, but at many others work at surface-level took place in the open air. Workers were generally expected to remain at their posts except in the most extreme weather conditions. Bal maidens wore gooks, a specialised bonnet which covered the shoulders and extended over the face to protect from rain, bright sunlight, flying debris and loud noise. In the winter the gook was made of felt, and in summer of cotton. Working in close proximity to heavy industrial machinery, they wore shorter dresses or skirts than the ankle-length clothing typical of the period, and their exposed lower legs were wrapped in protective coverings. Their arms were sometimes protected by hessian sleeves worn over their clothes. Some bal maidens working in cobbing and bucking wore rubber tubing on the fingers of one hand as protection from their hammer. While working bal maidens wore a waist-length hessian apron ('towser') over their clothes, and those who could afford it would have a white herden (flax and hemp) apron for wearing to and from work. These <b>working</b> <b>clothes</b> were accessorised with flowers, bows, ribbons, jewellery and other decoration. Until the end of the 19thcentury the working clothing of a bal maiden changed very little.|$|E

[...] It {{appeared}} to Haywood that the deck was stacked, and no enduring gains could be won for the workers short of changing {{the rules of the}} game. Increasingly, his industrial unionism took on a revolutionary flavor. In 1905 Haywood joined the more left-leaning socialists, labor anarchists in the Haymarket tradition, and other militant unionists to formulate the concept of revolutionary industrial unionism that animated the Industrial Workers of the World. Haywood called this philosophy [...] "socialism with its <b>working</b> <b>clothes</b> on." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his inaugural lecture, Lake published two important books on historical and exegetical matters concerning the New Testament during his time in Leiden: The Historical Evidence for the Resurrection of Jesus Christ (1907) and The Earlier Epistles of St. Paul: Their Motive and Origin (1911). [...] As Metzger explains: [...] "These studies, particularly the latter, revealed Lake's ability to analyze and evaluate complex historical and literary data and to set forth scholarly reconstructions with clarity and a certain persuasiveness." [...] In Historical Evidence Lake sets forth his approach: [...] "The first task of the historical inquirer is to collect the pieces of evidence; the second is to discuss the trustworthiness and meaning of each separate piece; {{and the third is}} to reconstruct the events to which the evidence relates" [...] (p.6). [...] As for the reconstruction, he explains: [...] "In any such attempt it is desirable to remember that the reconstruction of an original tradition from forms of later dates and of divergent contents must be guided by exactly the same principle as is the reconstruction of an original text from a number of extant MSS. [...] In each case the fundamental problem is the retracing of the line of development followed by the various authorities, and the solution depends chiefly on the ability to detect errors of transmission and to explain their existence" [...] (p.167). [...] As for The Earlier Epistles, Neill writes: [...] "I think {{that those of us who}} read Lake when we were young will be inclined to think that this is one of the best books on the New Testament that has ever been written in the English language. [...] This is the way it ought to be done. [...] Under Lake's skillful guidance, we feel ourselves one with those new and struggling groups of Christians, in all the perplexities of trying to discover what it means to be a Christian in a non-Christian world. [...] And there is the Apostle, so very much in <b>working</b> <b>clothes</b> and without a halo; we feel in our bones the passionate eagerness of Paul for better news from Corinth, the passionate relief when the good news arrives." [...] The book brought the conclusions of the German history of religions school to the attention of English-speaking world for the first time, and all later New Testament study has been influenced by this book.|$|E

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE—The {{characteristics}} of some populations make epidemiological measurement extremely difficult. The {{objective of this}} study is to identify risk factors that explain variation among incidence densities and proportions of one occupational illness, green tobacco sickness, within one such special population, Latino migrant and seasonal farmworkers in the United States.  DESIGN—Prospective cohort study.  SETTING— 37 farmworker residential sites located in Granville and Wake Counties, North Carolina, USA.  PARTICIPANTS— 182 migrant and seasonal farmworkers that included 178  Latino men, three Latino women, and one non-Hispanic white man.  MAIN RESULTS—Green tobacco sickness had a prevalence of 0. 082, and an incidence density of events per 100  days of 1. 88  among the farmworkers. Prevalence and incidence density increased from early to late agricultural season. Major risk factors included lack of work experience, work activities, and <b>working</b> in wet <b>clothes.</b> Tobacco use was protective.  CONCLUSION—Green tobacco sickness has a high incidence among migrant and seasonal farmworkers. Because workers have little control over most risk factors, further research is needed to identify ways to prevent this occupational illness.    Keywords: occupational health; farmworker...|$|R
