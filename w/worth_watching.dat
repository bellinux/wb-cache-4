25|$|As a batsman Jupp {{struck the}} happy medium between {{enterprise}} and caution. He watched the ball {{so well that}} when occasion demanded he could play a rigidly defensive game, while on a fast wicket there were few cricketers of his day better <b>worth</b> <b>watching.</b> He possessed {{a wide variety of}} strokes, and can drive or out with equal power and facility. His footwork, too, was so good that on a treacherous pitch he was a particularly valuable batsman. Before the First World War, and for a time afterwards he bowled medium pace rather on the quick side, but later took a shorter run, and became a slow to slow-medium bowler. Few bowlers of the 1920s spun the ball as much as he did and, with a wicket to help him, he could make it turn to a pronounced degree. One of the secrets of his success as a bowler was his cleverness in adapting himself to the changing conditions of a pitch. He was also rated as a brilliant fieldsman at cover point.|$|E
25|$|Richard Eisenbeis of Anime Now {{called the}} series his most {{anticipated}} anime of the season, being curious {{about how it}} would handle the adaptation of a branching story into a single one. Bamboo Dong, Paul Jensen, Rebecca Silverman and Theron Martin at Anime News Network reviewed episode 0 and 1 {{as part of a}} preview of that anime season. Dong did not expect the anime's ending to be good, but was still interested in how the story would turn out, and appreciated the use of Chaos;Head-like visuals and atmosphere. Jensen did not, however, think the atmosphere worked, saying that it seemed like the show was intended to give a feeling of dread, but that it failed to do so, partially due to the large amount of information communicated to the viewer. Silverman thought episode 1, with the exception of some sequences, felt bland, but still <b>worth</b> <b>watching</b> for a few more episodes to get a grasp of what direction the story would take. Martin thought the story moved slightly too fast, resulting in some character motivations being weakly established. He enjoyed the visuals and music, but said that the character design, while attractive, looked unoriginal.|$|E

Barber found Departures to be [...] "heartfelt, unpretentious, [...] slyly funny", <b>worth</b> <b>watching</b> (though ultimately predictable).
