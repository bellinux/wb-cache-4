2500|$|Rav Hana (or {{some say}} Hanin) bar Bizna {{said in the}} name of Rabbi Simeon the Pious that because Joseph sanctified God's Name in private when he {{resisted}} Potiphar's wife's advances, one letter from God's Name was added to Joseph's name. Rabbi Johanan interpreted the words, [...] "And it came to pass about this time, that he <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> to do his work," [...] in [...] to teach that both Joseph and Potiphar's wife had the intention to act immorally. Rav and Samuel differed in their interpretation of the words [...] "he <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> to do his work." [...] One said that it really means that Joseph went to do his household work, but the other said that Joseph went to satisfy his desires. Interpreting the words, [...] "And there was none of the men of the house there within," [...] in [...] the Gemara asked whether it was possible that no man was present in a huge house like Potiphar's. A Baraita was taught in the School of Rabbi Ishmael that the day was Potiphar's household's feast-day, and they had all gone to their idolatrous temple, but Potiphar's wife had pretended to be ill, because she thought that she would not again have an opportunity like that day to associate with Joseph. The Gemara taught that just at the moment reported in [...] when [...] "she caught him by his garment, saying: ‘Lie with me,' Jacob's image came and appeared to Joseph through the window. Jacob told Joseph that Joseph and his brothers were destined to have their names inscribed upon the stones of the ephod, and Jacob asked whether it was Joseph's wish to have his name expunged from the ephod and be called an associate of harlots, as [...] says, [...] "He that keeps company with harlots wastes his substance." [...] Immediately, in the words of [...] "his bow abode in strength." [...] Rabbi Johanan said {{in the name of}} Rabbi Meir that this means that his passion subsided. And then, in the words of [...] "the arms of his hands were made active," [...] meaning that he stuck his hands in the ground and his lust went out from between his fingernails.|$|E
2500|$|ISM activist Richard Purssell testified, [...] "hey began {{demolishing}} one house. We {{gathered around}} {{and called out}} to them and <b>went</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> so they backed out. During the entire time they knew who we were and what we were doing, because they didn't shoot at us. We stood in their way and shouted. There were about eight of us in an area about 70 square meters. Suddenly, we saw they turned to a house they had started to demolish before, and I saw Rachel {{standing in the way}} of the front bulldozer." [...] Human-rights activists and Palestinians say that the demolitions had also been accompanied by gunﬁre from Israeli snipers. The director of Rafah's hospital, Dr. Ali Moussa said that 240 Palestinians, including 78 children, had been killed since the Al-Aqsa Intifada began in 2001, [...] "Every night there is shooting at houses in which children are sleeping, without any attacks from Palestinians." [...] The United Nations said that 582 Rafah homes were demolished and 721 damaged, with 5,305 people made homeless.|$|E

2500|$|On 18 April 1963, the 17-year-old Jane Asher {{interviewed the}} Beatles at Royal Albert Hall in London, England {{and began a}} five-year {{relationship}} with Paul McCartney. In December 1963, McCartney took up residence at Asher's family Wimpole Street town house and stayed there until the couple moved into McCartney's own home located in St John's Wood in 1966. McCartney wrote several Beatles songs inspired by her, including [...] "And I Love Her", [...] "You Won't See Me", [...] "I'm Looking Through You", and [...] "Here, There and Everywhere". McCartney and Asher announced on Christmas Day 1967 that they were engaged to marry, and in February and March 1968, Asher accompanied the Beatles and their respective partners to Rishikesh to attend an advanced Transcendental Meditation training session with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. In mid-1968, Asher returned to London from an acting assignment in Bristol earlier than expected and caught McCartney in bed with Francie Schwartz. A fan who frequently hung around Paul's Cavendish Avenue home claims to have witnessed the incident, saying, [...] "...Paul brought this American girl home......another car turned into Cavendish Avenue — it was Jane.
