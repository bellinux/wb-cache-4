All the things that had sustained us for six years were suddenly gone. We had no crutches. From that point on, every time <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to write a mythology show, {{we knew it was}} going to be a completely different challenge." [...] Chris Carter saw the episode as a transitional episode, stating [...] "I felt that, with [...] "The Sixth Extinction", I was just playing a supporting role and that the episode, essentially the middle episode of a three-episode arc, was just a transitional episode to get us to '', which was really less about the mythology and more about Mulder's choices in life." ...|$|E
500|$|After the 53rd Grammy Awards, held in February 2011, {{band members}} Charles Kelley and Dave Haywood {{said in a}} {{backstage}} interview that work on the group's third album was almost complete. On May 2, 2011, the band [...] digitally released [...] "Just a Kiss", the lead single from the new project. In a blog entry on their website, the group said that [...] "Just a Kiss" [...] was among the last songs that were written for the album. Haywood commented, [...] "We were about six songs into recording and someone had this idea, so <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to write it." [...] Hillary Scott, Kelley and Haywood wrote the song with Dallas Davidson. Davidson discussed the conception of the song with country music blog Taste of Country: [...] "I {{went out on the}} road with them, and we wrote a couple of things. We recorded one song called 'We Own the Night'. Charles called me as they were about done with the record. He said, 'Man, we want to write again.' So the band came over [...] one morning. We started writing this other song. We were trying to find Hillary a little uptempo girl song. We wrote this cool thing." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Justin Francis, and co-directed by Nick Cannon {{on the island of}} Eleuthera in the Bahamas. The video became notable for the pair, {{due to the fact that}} it was during its conception and recording that they began dating, and eventually wed two months later. The video was shot in early April 2008, but was delayed until May, with several critics suggesting it because of the couples engagement. In an interview with Fox News, Cannon spoke of his feelings when first speaking with Carey regarding the video:"From the first time <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> to discuss the video at the Beverly Hills Hotel, we connected. We had so much in common spiritually, and we laugh at the same things. I didn't have to put on my Mac Daddy suave mode. I was able to be myself with her. We are both eternally 12 years old." [...] The pair eloped in the Bahamas, at Carey's private estate in Eleuthera, and wed on April 30, 2008. The couple stayed on the island for over two weeks after the nuptials for their honeymoon, which is why the video was delayed until mid-May, so Carey would be able to promote it in time.|$|E

500|$|Madonna has {{performed}} the song during The Girlie Show World Tour in 1993, accompanied by back up singers Niki Haris and Donna De Lory. All {{three of them}} appeared onstage wearing long black see-through robes. Haris recalled in Lucy O'Brien's book , [...] "that {{was the first time}} [...] <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> together and felt our harmonies. Madonna's voice was starting to get strong and she was into trying new things." [...] During the bridge, they performed a fragment of Motown group The Temptations' 1971 hit [...] "Just My Imagination (Running Away with Me)". In his review of the concert in New York City, The New York Timess Jon Pareles felt that during the performance the music was reminiscent of [...] "Motown, girl groups and James Brown." [...] After the song was finished, an interlude, featuring a pierrot and several dancers dressed in black outfits and holding umbrellas began. Set to an instrumental version of the song, the interlude featured a choreography partially inspired in the classic Gene Kelly musical Singin' in the Rain. According to author Michelle Morgan, Kelly himself advised Madonna on some of the choreography. The performance on the November 19, 1993 show at Sydney Cricket Ground was recorded and released on VHS and Laserdisc on April 26, 1994, as [...]|$|E
500|$|The band {{refused to}} explain their lyrics {{to the press and}} did not print lyric sheets. Curtis told the fanzine Printed Noise, [...] "We haven't got a message really; the lyrics are open to interpretation. They're multidimensional. You can read into them what you like." [...] The other band members later {{admitted}} they paid little attention to what Curtis was writing. In a 1987 interview with Option, Morris said that they [...] "just thought the songs were sort of sympathetic and more uplifting than depressing. But everyone's got their own opinion." [...] Deborah Curtis recalled that only with the release of Closer did many who were close to the singer realise [...] "is intentions and feelings were all there within the lyrics". The surviving members of the band in retrospect regret not seeing warning signs in Curtis's lyrics. [...] "This sounds awful but it was only after Ian died that <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and listened to the lyrics", Morris said in 2007. [...] "You'd find yourself thinking, 'Oh my God, I missed this one'. Because I'd look at Ian's lyrics and think how clever he was putting himself in the position of someone else. I never believed he was writing about himself. Looking back, how could I have been so bleedin' stupid? Of course he was writing about himself. But I didn't go in and grab him and ask, 'What's up?' I have to live with that".|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} year of {{development}} the team focused mostly on the gameplay without any narrative structure. Playtesters found the game to be fun but asked about what these test chambers were leading towards. This prompted to team {{to come up with a}} narrative for Portal. The Portal team worked with Half-Life series writer Marc Laidlaw on fitting the game into the series' plot. This was done, in part, due to the limited art capabilities of the small team; instead of creating new assets for Portal, they decided to tie the game to an existing franchise—Half-Life—to allow them to reuse the Half-Life 2 art assets. Wolpaw and Faliszek were put to work on the dialogue for Portal. The concept of a computer AI guiding the player through experimental facilities to test the portal gun was arrived at early in the writing process. They drafted early lines for the yet-named [...] "polite" [...] AI with humorous situations, such as requesting the player's character to [...] "assume the party escort submission position", and found this style of approach to be well-suited to the game they wanted to create, ultimately leading to the creation of the GLaDOS character. GLaDOS was central to the plot, as Wolpaw notes [...] "We designed the game to have a very clear beginning, middle, and end, and we wanted GLaDOS to go through a personality shift at each of these points." [...] Wolpaw further describes the idea of using cake as the reward came about as [...] "at the beginning of the Portal development process, <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> as a group to decide what philosopher or school of philosophy our game would be based on. That was followed by about 15 minutes of silence and then someone mentioned that a lot of people like cake." [...] The cake element along with additional messages given to the player in the behind-the-scenes areas were written and drawn by Kim Swift.|$|E

2500|$|Avalanche Software {{started working}} with Marvel Entertainment, after it was {{acquired}} by Disney in 2009, about developing a game featuring Marvel superheroes, in 2011. The conception of the game started immediately after the acquisition, as Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroess executive producer, John Vignocchi commented [...] "As soon as the acquisition happened we started having conversations about Marvel. I giggle that I know the date, because I checked in via Foursquare at Marvel. So that's how I knew, {{that was the first}} time <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> with Joe Quesada." [...] Avalanche developed a demo in October 2013, which featured the Marvel superhero Iron Man flying through a rudimentary city. The demo was later released to the public almost a year later.|$|E
2500|$|On 12 January 2015 the Prodigy {{released}} [...] "Nasty" [...] as {{the lead}} single off their upcoming album along with the title track on 26 January 2015. Howlett found that [...] "violent is the word that keeps on coming up" [...] when describing the album. The entire recording process took almost six years taking {{in a number of}} studios and a few restarts to establish that [...] "angry, energetic sound”. Unlike previous efforts The Day Is My Enemy became a band-album where Flint and Maxim worked in tandem with Howlett. This created a degree of friction although Flint noted that “four years ago <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and talked about where the next album was gonna go, and we knew we had to bust out the most ‘band’ album we could create".|$|E

2500|$|On January 20, 2012, the Wallflowers began {{recording}} their sixth studio album, Glad All Over at the Black Keys' Dan Auerbach's Easy Eye {{studio in}} Nashville. Jay Joyce, {{who had played}} guitar on the Wallflowers' Bringing Down the Horse agreed to produce the album. [...] Before going to the studio, the band had decided have a more collaborative writing process than {{they had in the}} past. [...] Instead of Dylan bringing in fully completed songs like he had done in the past, he only brought lyrics. [...] Dylan {{and the rest of the}} band wrote the music for the songs together in the studio. [...] Joyce explained: [...] "Jakob came to Nashville and <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> and I asked him to play me a song, but instead he pulled out this 2-inch-thick notebook. ‘This is what I’ve got. Let’s play some grooves and throw it around.’ I thought, ‘Wow, that’s kind of scary, but it’s exciting.’ So we didn’t really know going in what we were going to do. We had no songs, no demos. It was all developed in the studio. [...] The band finished recording on February 20, 2012.|$|E

He had a strong relationship with Bret. He wouldn't have done it, and Vince knew that. That's why he didn't tell Pat...". However, in Dave Meltzer's online account of events before, during, and after the Screwjob, he states [...] "Vince McMahon held a meeting at the hotel with Jim Ross, Jim Cornette, Pat Patterson and Michaels. Reports are that at least two of the aforementioned names looked extremely uncomfortable leaving the meeting" [...] which suggests that Patterson may in fact have been in on the Screwjob. This is corroborated by a Pro Wrestling Torch article from November 15, 1997 by Wade Keller which states, [...] "However, a two-hour meeting was held on the second floor of the Montreal Marriott on Saturday night with McMahon, Jim Ross, Pat Patterson, Jim Cornette, and Michaels. Bret was wrestling that night in Detroit. There is some belief that at this meeting McMahon proposed the idea of the finish to whoever of that group wasn't already in on it. Ross and Patterson entered the meeting in a good mood and when they were seen in the hotel lobby afterwards, were said to be irritable, forlorn, and shaken." ...|$|E
