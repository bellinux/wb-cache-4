In 1813, for example, Southey was telling the story to friends, and in 1831 Eleanor Mure fashioned a handmade booklet about the three bears and the old woman for her nephew Horace Broke's birthday. Southey and Mure differ in details. Southey's bears have porridge, but Mure's have milk; Southey's old woman has no motive for entering the house, but Mure's old <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> piqued when her courtesy visit is rebuffed; Southey's old woman runs away when discovered, but Mure's old <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> impaled on the steeple of St Paul's Cathedral.|$|E
