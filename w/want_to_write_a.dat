5|$|Fleming {{retained}} {{an interest}} in the subject and when Sillitoe suggested to the editor of The Sunday Times, Denis Hamilton, that the paper may <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> story on the International Diamond Security Organisation, Hamilton offered the story to Fleming. Sillitoe also offered his deputy, retired MI5 officer John Collard, as liaison for Fleming to interview. During World War II, Collard had assisted in the planning of Operation Overlord as part of MI11 and had joined MI5 under Sillitoe at the war's end. Whilst in MI5 he {{played a major role in}} the capture and conviction of the atomic spy Klaus Fuchs, before Sillitoe had approached him in 1954 to work for the International Diamond Security Organisation.|$|E
5|$|The third {{series of}} Cold Feet (2000) was {{extended}} {{from six to}} eight episodes by ITV. Bullen believed that the production team had covered all potential storylines {{in the first two}} series, so declined to write any more episodes. A team of five writers was hired by Granada Television, overseen by Bullen as a co-executive producer. Four out of the five writers left the team due to their scripts not being appropriate for the series, leaving only David Nicholls on staff. The writing process had made Bullen think twice about not writing and he began thinking about further storylines, such as mid-life crises and IVF. The same year, he signed a two-year contract with Granada to develop new projects. A fourth series of Cold Feet, also of eight episodes, was commissioned for 2001. Bullen announced that he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> fifth series, and that the fourth would be the last. His reasons were that with ITV's proposed commission of up to 20 episodes a year, the series would become like a soap opera. The popularity of the fourth series persuaded Bullen to write four more episodes that formed the fifth series in 2003. The fifth series won Bullen the Writer of the Year Award at the 2003 British Comedy Awards.|$|E

25|$|As a teenager, Gould wrote {{chamber music}} and piano {{works in the}} style of the Second Viennese school of composition. His only {{significant}} work was the String Quartet, Op. 1, which he finished when he was in his 20s, and perhaps his cadenzas to Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1. Later works include the Lieberson Madrigal (SATB and piano), and So You <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> <b>Write</b> <b>a</b> Fugue? (SATB with piano or string quartet accompaniment). The majority of his work is published by Schott Music. The recording Glenn Gould: The Composer contains his original works.|$|E
500|$|Musically, {{the album}} is more {{electronic}} and beat-driven than preceding releases, with reviewers commenting that its sound is at times reminiscent of KMFDM. This {{has been attributed to}} Sköld, {{who was a member of}} that band immediately prior to his arrival in Marilyn Manson. It is also not as metallic as their earlier work, with Manson explaining to MTV that he wanted to create music which was dissimilar to the nu metal being played on radio at the time. He also noted the influence of early industrial rock acts such as Ministry, Big Black and Nitzer Ebb on the material. Early twentieth-century German composer Kurt Weill was also claimed as an influence, along with the lucid dreams Manson was having during the album's production, elaborating that he would [...] "wake up and say, 'I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> song that sounds like a stampeding elephant' or 'I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> song that sounds like a burning piano'." ...|$|E

Bush and Al Gore to the Founders. His difficulty in properly assessing the Founders made him <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> book that both acknowledged their achievements and punctured the myth that they were [...] "demigods". He stated {{in an interview that}} he wanted to show that [...] "these folks didn't completely understand what they were doing... They were improvising on the edge of catastrophe." [...] Ellis did the research for the book personally, rather than working with research assistants. He wrote the manuscript by hand with a rollerball pen.|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the third series, Bullen announced that he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> fifth series, and that the fourth would be the last. Series 4, Episode 8 was produced as the final episode but the cast and crew realised {{that they would like to}} make one final series for proper closure. Bullen agreed to write the final episodes on the condition that there would be just four, and that he could kill off a character. Matt Greenhalgh co-wrote Series 5, Episode 3 with Bullen, specifically the scenes depicting Rachel's death. Greenhalgh worked on the script at the same time as he was writing his BBC Three series Burn It, also set in Manchester. In a 2007 interview, he said that he was not a fan of Cold Feet—decrying the depiction of Manchester in the series—and that killing off Rachel was [...] "a privilege".|$|E
500|$|Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club {{labeled the}} duet as [...] "eminently danceable paean to {{forbidden}} love". Lyrically, the couple proclaims their eternal fealty, make {{out in a}} Lexus and acknowledge {{the world that the}} romantic relationship between them is only their business. According to Billboards reviewer, in lines like [...] "you'll always be the one I want to come home to" [...] and [...] "you'll always be my baby", [...] "it makes the beyond-complicated circumstances of their history impossible to ignore." [...] Stacy-Ann Ellis of Vibe magazine, wrote that the song, like the couple’s first post-makeup collaboration, [...] "Birthday Cake (Remix)", is about the history they share and [...] "refuse to let go of—it’ll irk some people". Digital Spy's Robert Copsey noted that vocally Brown does his best to achieve a Jackson impression. Robert Leedham of Drowned in Sound stated that [...] "Nobody's Business" [...] "makes you <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> long, worthy think piece so you can come to terms with your own moral standing on it." ...|$|E

Gaiman eventually agreed to write a Marvel comic in August 2001, although he was not sure what it would contain. When the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred, Gaiman decided {{that he did not want}} planes, skyscrapers, bombs or guns in his comic. [...] "I didn't want it to be a war story, and I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> story in which might made right – or in which might made anything." [...] On a trip to Venice soon after, Gaiman was struck by how the [...] "past seemed very close at hand"; he returned from the trip knowing the story he wanted to tell. The time was chosen because [...] "it was a nice place to set the story. It gave me America and it gave me a lot of things that I wanted in terms of the way the world was changing. It also gave me the sense of wonder and magic." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1943 Vaughan Williams {{conducted}} {{the premiere of}} his Fifth Symphony at the Proms. Its serene tone contrasted with the stormy Fourth, and led some commentators to think it a symphonic valediction. William Glock wrote that it was [...] "like {{the work of a}} distinguished poet who has nothing very new to say, but says it in exquisitely flowing language". The music Vaughan Williams wrote for the BBC to celebrate the end of the war, Thanksgiving for Victory, was marked by what the critic Edward Lockspeiser called the composer's characteristic avoidance of [...] "any suggestion of rhetorical pompousness". Any suspicion that the septuagenarian composer had settled into benign tranquillity was dispelled by his Sixth Symphony (1948), described by the critic Gwyn Parry-Jones as [...] "one of the most disturbing musical statements of the 20th century", opening with a [...] "primal scream, plunging the listener immediately into a world of aggression and impending chaos." [...] Coming as it did near the start of the Cold War, many critics thought its pianissimo last movement a depiction of a nuclear-scorched wasteland. The composer was dismissive of programmatic theories: [...] "It never seems to occur to people that a man might just <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> piece of music." ...|$|E
500|$|For Key's second visual novel Air, Maeda {{admitted}} {{he felt he}} was able to write what he wanted to for the game's scenario, but he later discovered that Air was difficult for players to receive and experience. Due to this, Maeda felt that for Key's next work Clannad, he had a sense of duty to make the game easier to receive for as many users as possible. In any case, he wanted to make it an entertaining game, and started planning on Clannad almost immediately after Airs completion. From the start of Clannads planning, Maeda did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> story like in Air, but instead wanted to focus on writing a deep connection between the 'people and the town', and 'humanity'. Maeda noted that he exceeded his writing ability when writing most of the scenarios in Clannad, and equates Clannads writing process as a [...] "wall that I {{will never be able to}} get over again." [...] While at the beginning Maeda felt he was prepared, the entire game's story started to increase to a level Maeda never predicted, and Suzumoto noted that it approximately doubled in size from the original projected length. Suzumoto attributed the increase due to the lengthening structure of the game's base scenario which caused the 'branch' scenarios to increase as well.|$|E

500|$|Cobain {{stated in}} a 1993 {{interview}} with The Observer that [...] "for {{the most part}} 's very impersonal". [...] The songwriter also told Q that year that the abundance of infant and childbirth imagery on the album and his newfound fatherhood were coincidental. [...] However, Azerrad argued {{that much of the}} album contains personal themes, noting that Grohl held a similar view. [...] Grohl said, [...] "A lot of {{what he has to say}} is related to a lot of the shit he's gone through. [...] And it's not so much teen angst anymore. [...] It's a whole different ball game: rock star angst." [...] Cobain downplayed recent events ("I really haven't had that exciting a life") and told Azerrad that he did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> track that explicitly expressed his anger at the media, but the author countered that [...] "Rape Me" [...] seemed to deal with that very issue. [...] While Cobain said the song was written long before his troubles with drug addiction became public, he agreed that the song could be viewed in that light. [...] "Serve The Servants" [...] contains comments about Cobain's life, both as a child and as an adult. [...] The opening lines [...] "Teenage angst has paid off well/Now I'm bored and old" [...] were a reference to Cobain's state of mind in the wake of Nirvana's success. [...] Cobain dismissed the media attention given to the effect his parents' divorce had on his life with the line [...] "That legendary divorce is such a bore" [...] from the chorus, and directly addressed his father with the lines [...] "I tried hard to have a father/But instead I had a dad/I just want you to know that I don't hate you anymore/There is nothing I could say that I haven't thought before". [...] Cobain said he wanted his father to know he did not hate him, but had no desire to talk to him.|$|E

2500|$|Eschewing the lyrical {{depth and}} {{symbolism}} found on Holy Wood, {{the album was}} relatively straightforward: in an extended metaphor, Manson compares his own often-criticized work to the Entartete Kunst banned by the Nazi regime. Lyrically, Manson utilizes the narrative mode of stream of consciousness throughout the album to examine the human psyche in times of crisis, specifically focusing on the mindset of lunatics and children, as, according to Manson, [...] "they don't follow the rules [...]" [...] Several songs incorporate elements commonly found in playground chants and nursery rhymes, which Manson would [...] "pervert into something ugly and lurid." [...] The work of Kurt Weill was also noted as an influence, along with the lucid dreams the singer was having during its production, with Manson explaining that he would [...] "wake up and say, 'I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> song {{that sounds like a}} stampeding elephant,' or 'I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> song that sounds like a burning piano.'" ...|$|E

I think about it all the time, there's so many things that I want to sing, melodies, and lyrics. So, if you have people you want to work with for a lifetime, there's no reason you can't write songs until the day you die." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a rare 2002 {{interview}} with the Phoenix New Times, Harris recalled her ambivalence about even bringing the troupe to New York from Chicago. She said, [...] "When I was at Second City, there was a vote about whether we should take our show to Broadway or not. Andrew Duncan and I voted no. I stayed in New York, but only because Richard Rodgers and Alan Jay Lerner came and said, 'We <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> musical for you!' Well, I wasn't big on musical theater. I had seen part of South Pacific in Chicago and I walked out. But it was Richard Rodgers calling!" ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{library is}} also a {{collection}} of implementations of behavior, written {{in terms of a}} language, that has a well-defined interface by which the behavior is invoked. For instance, people who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>write</b> <b>a</b> higher level program can use a library to make system calls instead of implementing those system calls over and over again. In addition, the behavior is provided for reuse by multiple independent programs. [...] A program invokes the library-provided behavior via a mechanism of the language. [...] For example, in a simple imperative language such as C, the behavior in a library is invoked by using C's normal function-call. [...] What distinguishes the call as being to a library function, versus being to another function in the same program, is the way that the code is organized in the system.|$|E
