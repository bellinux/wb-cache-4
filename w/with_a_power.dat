5|$|Rather {{than using}} a turn-based battle system like {{contemporaneous}} role-playing games, Secret of Mana features real-time battles <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>power</b> bar mechanic. The game {{has a unique}} Ring Command menu system, which pauses the action and allows the player to make decisions {{in the middle of}} battle. An innovative cooperative multiplayer system allows a second or third player to drop {{in and out of the}} game at any time. Secret of Mana was directed and designed by Koichi Ishii, programmed primarily by Nasir Gebelli, and produced by veteran Square designer Hiromichi Tanaka.|$|E

5|$|The {{afterglow}} of GRB970508 {{reached a}} peak total luminosity 19.82days after the burst was detected. It then faded <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>power</b> law slope over about 100days. The afterglow eventually disappeared, revealing the burst's host, an actively star-forming dwarf galaxy with an apparent magnitude of V=25.4±0.15. The galaxy was well fitted by an exponential disk with an ellipticity of 0.70±0.07. The redshift of GRB 970508's optical afterglow, z=0.835, {{agreed with the}} host galaxy's redshift of z=0.83, suggesting that, unlike previously observed bursts, GRB 970508 may {{have been associated with}} an active galactic nucleus.|$|E
5|$|The {{politician}} Themistocles, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>power</b> base {{firmly established}} amongst the poor, filled the vacuum left by Miltiades's death, {{and in the}} following decade became the most influential politician in Athens. During this period, Themistocles continued to support the expansion of Athens' naval power. The Athenians were aware throughout this period that the Persian interest in Greece had not ended, and Themistocles's naval policies {{may be seen in}} the light of the potential threat from Persia. Aristides, Themistocles's great rival, and champion of the zeugites (the 'upper hoplite-class') vigorously opposed such a policy.|$|E

5|$|British aero engines were {{normally}} equipped <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>power</b> take-off shaft {{that led}} {{to the rear of the}} engine. In twin engine aircraft like the Anson, one of these would be used for a generator that powered the aircraft instruments at 24V DC, the other would be left unconnected and available for use. Following a suggestion from Watt to avoid Air Ministry channels, in October Bowen flew one of the Battles to the Metropolitan-Vickers (Metrovick) plant in Sheffield, where he pulled the DC generator off the engine, dropped it on the table, and asked for an AC alternator of similar size and shape. Arnold Tustin, Metrovick's lead engineer, was called in to consider the problem, and after a few minutes he returned to say that he could supply an 80V unit at 1200 to 2400Hz and 800W, even better than the 500W requested. Bowen had an order for 18 pre-production units placed as soon as possible, and the first units started arriving at the end of October. A second order for 400 more quickly followed. Eventually about 133,800 of these alternators would be produced during the war.|$|E
5|$|Hershey won {{the first}} game 5–2 on April 26, with Crabb opening scoring <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>power</b> play goal, and the Bears taking a 4–0 lead by the second period, {{resulting}} in Providence goaltender Niklas Svedberg being pulled from the game. The victory marked Hershey's first game one win in a playoff series since defeating Manchester in the 2009–10 Eastern Conference finals. The Bears also won their second game 5–4 on April 28, with Grubauer making 54 saves, eight short of matching the team's playoff record. The Bruins allowed 64 shots, which were six short of Hershey's highest in a playoff game. Hershey was losing 4–3 in the third, their first time trailing in the series, but Grubauer was pulled for an extra attacker and Crabb tied the game with 91 seconds in regulation, allowing DiSalvatore to score the game-winner in overtime on a power play. Hershey's 5-for-10 power play record ranked {{the highest in the}} Calder Cup playoffs at the time.|$|E
5|$|In 1445, Casimir, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, {{was asked}} to assume the Polish throne vacated upon {{the death of his}} brother Władysław. Casimir was a tough {{negotiator}} and did not accept the Polish nobility's conditions for his election. He finally arrived in Poland and was crowned in 1447 on his own terms. His assumption of the Crown of Poland freed Casimir from the control that the Lithuanian oligarchy had imposed on him; in the Vilnius Privilege of 1447, he declared the Lithuanian nobility to have equal rights with Polish szlachta. In time, Casimir was able to wrest power from Cardinal Oleśnicki and his group. He replaced their influence <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>power</b> base built on the younger middle nobility. Casimir was able to resolve a conflict with the pope and the local Church hierarchy over the right to fill vacant bishop positions in his favor.|$|E

5|$|Like the {{previous}} {{titles in the}} Prime series, Metroid Prime Hunters is generally classified as a first-person adventure to highlight the focus on navigation and discovery. However, the game differs from its predecessors with the removal of assisted aiming, more action-oriented gameplay, and the inclusion of an online multiplayer mode. The player controls Samus Aran, who is equipped <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>Power</b> Suit that allows her to access her gunship from anywhere. She can scan almost any object in the game; the gunship will return relevant information retrieved from its database. An Arm Cannon {{is attached to the}} Power Suit, which she uses to attack enemies. To enter small tunnels, Samus can roll into a Morph Ball, an alternative form of the Power Suit that decreases her size substantially. In this form, she is given an unlimited supply of bombs but is only allowed to use three at a time. She can use the bombs to defend herself and destroy small objects.|$|E
