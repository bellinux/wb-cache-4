40|$|Based on a swine producer's profit {{maximization}} {{model in which}} manure value and packers' live market weight pricing systems are considered, the optimal farm inventory and optimal hog market weight are simultaneously solved for scenarios generated from the combination of two crop rotations, two forms of manure storage, two levels of manure incorporation, and two nutrient application standards. First, our results suggest that manure value has {{a significant impact on}} the optimal farm inventory as well as on the profitability of an operation. The optimal size of operation identified is quite large and varies considerably among the scenarios. Our results indicate that shallow pit buildings with lagoons can support a larger operation scale and require less acreage for manure dispersion than systems with slurry basins. For slurry basin systems, manure applications <b>with</b> <b>immediate</b> <b>incorporation</b> are more profitable than applications with no incorporation. Second, our results show that the optimal hog market weight is insensitive to benefits and costs of manure handling and application, reflecting a dominant influence of the pricing system on a producer's hog marketing decision. Finally, our results show that though more acres are needed for manure application when a P standard is applied in a corn-soybean rotation, still a P standard is economically advantageous to swine farmers and this standard also makes better use of manure nutrients.

40|$|Research {{during the}} past few years has shown that severe {{deficiencies}} of nitrogen (N) are common in fields where manure was applied without <b>immediate</b> <b>incorporation.</b> Data gathered in 2001 continue to support this conclusion and emphasize the need to use the late-spring test to check nitrate levels in such fields. <b>Immediate</b> <b>incorporation</b> of manure into soil is an effective way to reduce odor and losses of N soon after application. Incorporation reduces volatilization of ammonia, which can be a serious problem if manure is spread after it has been stored in pits or piles...|$|R
40|$|We {{carried out}} four {{replicated}} field experiments {{to measure the}} impacts of <b>immediate</b> <b>incorporation</b> of solid manures on emissions of ammonia (NH 3) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Four manures: cattle farmyard manure (FYM); pig FYM; layer manure and broiler manure were applied to the soil surface or immediately incorporated by mouldboard plough, disc or tine. Two of the experiments were carried out on a clay soil and two on a sandy soil {{to find out whether}} soil type interacted with incorporation technique to influence emissions of NH 3 or N 2 O. Ammonia emissions were measured for 1 or 2 weeks while N 2 O emissions were measured for 60 days in one experiment and for a complete year in the other three experiments. <b>Immediate</b> <b>incorporation</b> by plough reduced NH 3 emissions by c. 90...|$|R

40|$|There {{are many}} human factors that {{contribute}} to poor air quality, and agriculture is no exception. Best management practices such as the <b>immediate</b> <b>incorporation</b> of manure, nutrient conservation,reduced fertilizer use, reduced tillage, keeping silage covered, covers on manure storage structures,and alternatives to burning can help minimize emissions of air pollutants. Although livestock production is a significant contributor of greenhouse gases, long-term cropping systems can sequester carbon which reduces greenhouse gas emissions...|$|R

These techniques recognize that the passive model of the typical college lecture does not work for many students. Instead, active {{and cooperative}} learning focuses on the premise that students learn best by doing and working with each other. This paper presents background information on active and cooperative learning techniques at a practical level for <b>immediate</b> <b>incorporation</b> into simulation education.

40|$|Liquid manure, when stored long-term, has no oxygen (anaerobic conditions) {{resulting}} {{in the development and}} release of a number of manureborne gases including various odorous compounds and methane (a greenhouse gas). With favorable economics, many farms with long-term manure storages could reduce odor and other air emissions by installing a storage cover. Cover products area available for earthen, concrete and steel storages. When properly designed and managed, covered storages can greatly reduce farmstead odor emissions. However, when manure is recycled to cropland, odor emissions will occur, though injection or <b>immediate</b> <b>incorporation</b> can reduce field odor emissions...|$|R
50|$|Compared {{to other}} {{national}} mass organizations of the FLN period (such as UGTA and UNJA) UNPA has less autonomy because the {{many of its}} ostensible functions were already {{taken over by the}} Ministry of Agriculture. Most farming lands had been nationalized under Houari Boumediène's presidency. The UNPA membership was made up by farmers who either had few or no noncollectivized lands. Since UNPA didn't have any legacy of independent union activity prior to its foundation and <b>immediate</b> <b>incorporation</b> into the political set-up of the dominant political party, UNPA proved less politically active, less cohesive, and less influential than some other contemporary Algerian mass organizations.|$|R
40|$|Given the {{documented}} {{benefits of}} participation in communicative interaction (e. g., Gass & varonis, 1994; Mackey, 1999), {{the present study investigated}} the effects of interlocutor type on the provision and incorporation of feedback in task–based interaction. The interactions of 48 dyads, evenly divided among adults and children, and native speaker–nonnative speaker and nonnative speaker–native speaker, were analyzed to assess the effect of interlocutor on (1) amount of feedback, (2) opportunities for modified output, and (3) <b>immediate</b> <b>incorporation</b> of feedback. In all dyed types, at least 30 % of errors resulted in feedback, much of which led to modified output. Analyses also revealed significant differences for amount, nature, and response to feedback according to dyad type...|$|R
50|$|Fonck {{was born}} on 27 March 1894 {{in the village of}} Saulcy-sur-Meurthe in the Vosges region of north eastern France. During his {{formative}} years, he would have received an engineering education at Ecole Nationale Superieure des Arts et Metiers - a point that is still in debate since there is no record of this assertion. Fonck actually left school when he was 13. Although he had been interested in aviation from his youth, he was rejected for <b>immediate</b> <b>incorporation</b> in the air service when conscripted on 22 August 1914, instead he was requested to undergo five months basic training in the combat engineers. His basic training duties involved him first in digging trenches near Épinal, and later in bridge repairs on the Moselle river.|$|R
40|$|Liberalization can target many {{different}} markets and activities, ranging from goods markets, to capital markets, to direct investment in goods and services. These alternatives differ {{with respect to}} the types of barriers that must be removed and the effect of the liberalization on knowledge transmission and growth. This paper builds a model {{based on the premise that}} an important source of knowledge transmission to developing and transition economies is direct contact with foreign experts such as engineering and management consultants. The services of these experts allow the <b>immediate</b> <b>incorporation</b> of knowledge into production that would be costly in terms of time and resources to develop domestically, and in addition there may be an (uncompensated) spillover to domestic managers and engineers through working with the foreign experts...|$|R
40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{the understanding}} {{on the rights}} of a legislator to pass legal norms <b>with</b> <b>immediate</b> effect. Although, up to now legal doctrine has viewed inadmissibility of retroactive legal norms more largely, in practice {{there are a lot more}} legal norms <b>with</b> <b>immediate</b> effect passed. Therefore the article firstly assesses features according to which legal norms related to past are passed <b>with</b> an <b>immediate</b> effect. Similarly, in light of the general view of case-law and legal doctrine that prima facie consider legal norms <b>with</b> <b>immediate</b> effect admissible and lawful, the article reveals the historical origin and development of this opinion. In addition, as the above assumption on admissibility of the legal norms <b>with</b> <b>immediate</b> effect is not absolute and is exposed to assessment of legitimate expectations of addressees of legal norms, a significant attention has been drawn to methodology of the admissibility assessment. Within the framework of analysis of methodology, the article views both different methods applicable for assessment of public interest and addressees of legal norms in cases of immediate effect as well as various circumstances that might be the basis to acknowledge legal norms <b>with</b> <b>immediate</b> effect as illegitimate...|$|R
