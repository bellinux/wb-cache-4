5|$|BioWare {{announced}} that they would support the game with downloadable content for at least 2 years. The DLC packs are both story-based and content-based, and added in elements that were cut from the base game, such as Shale, a stone-based companion <b>who</b> <b>always</b> gets stuck in doors and causes trouble with the camera system. A crossover with Mass Effect 2, an item called the Blood Dragon Armor, is also available for purchase.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, journalists, {{eager to}} sensationalize {{the events of}} the Great Fire, were quick to find in Mrs. Kate O'Leary an easy {{scapegoat}} for the calamitous inferno. As a working-class immigrant and a woman, Kate O'Leary was an easy target for those publications <b>who</b> <b>always</b> found it comfortable to vilify Irish Catholics who had not yet assimilated into the dominant American middle-class culture.|$|E
5|$|Murray Beck {{writes that}} Macdonald's {{political}} appeal to Nova Scotians {{may have been}} even stronger than the legendary Joseph Howe's. Like Howe, Macdonald was a passionate and eloquent leader whose elegantly crafted speeches reflected his wit, wide learning and respect for factual accuracy. Beck writes that by scrupulously fulfilling his campaign promises, Macdonald became known as a leader <b>who</b> <b>always</b> kept his word.|$|E

5|$|The pilot-in-command was 50-year-old Urs Zimmermann. At {{the time}} of the accident, he had {{approximately}} 10,800 hours of total flying time, of which 900 hours were in an MD-11. He was also an instructor pilot for the MD-11. Before his career with Swissair, he was a fighter pilot in the Swiss Air Force. Zimmermann was described as a friendly person with professional skills, <b>who</b> <b>always</b> worked with exactness and precision.|$|E
5|$|All trucks of the LRDG were {{equipped}} with the Bagnold sun compass and some trucks were also {{equipped with}} a P8 Tank Compass. Each patrol had a navigator <b>who</b> <b>always</b> rode in the second truck in the formation. He was equipped with a theodolite and astronomical position tables with which to plot star sightings, and maps. Watches were used and adjusted each evening using the GMT time check. One major problem faced early on by the LRDG {{was a lack of}} accurate maps for Libya in particular. Patrols had to do their own surveys and make their own maps of each route they took. In July 1941 the Survey Section was formed to carry out this task.|$|E
5|$|During {{her first}} {{appearances}} as {{a figment of}} Newt's imagination, Rae was depicted as a goth with an emo persona. When she was reintroduced as a real person, Rae's character was more reminiscent {{to that of a}} chav. The character later underwent a transitional period; she retained her strong personality, but displayed a weaker side resulting from the setbacks she encountered. Barlow found the role challenging, as her own personality is dissimilar from her character's. She described Rae as someone <b>who</b> <b>always</b> makes her opinion known, and hoped she would be remembered for her strong-willed persona.|$|E

5|$|However, this outward {{dullness}} concealed a sharp {{mind and}} great administrative talent. He operated mainly {{behind the scenes}} and cultivated {{an image of a}} colourless bureaucrat – for example, he was the only Bolshevik leader <b>who</b> <b>always</b> wore a suit and tie. In 1928 Molotov replaced Nikolai Uglanov as First Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party and held that position until 15 August 1929. In a lengthy address to the Central Committee in 1929, Molotov told the members the Soviet government would initiate a compulsory collectivisation campaign to solve the agrarian backwardness of Soviet agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Judging by his {{achievements}} alone, {{he must have}} been a remarkable man. He had enormous drive, an ability to remain calm despite enormous pressures, and extreme skill in organisation. He was a man of honour <b>who</b> <b>always</b> kept his word and his promise. He had no interest in public honours and refused invitations to stand for Parliament. Although he accepted honours from France and Austria, he mislaid the medals and had to request duplicates to please his wife. His great-great-grandson considers that he was successful because he inspired people rather than drove them.|$|E
5|$|Through his father, Prince Dom João (later King Dom JoãoVI), Pedro was {{a member}} of the House of Braganza (Portuguese: Bragança) and a {{grandson}} of King Dom PedroIII and Queen Dona (Lady) MariaI of Portugal, who were uncle and niece as well as husband and wife. His mother, Doña Carlota Joaquina, was the daughter of King Don CarlosIV of Spain. Pedro's parents had an unhappy marriage. Carlota Joaquina was an ambitious woman, <b>who</b> <b>always</b> sought to advance Spain's interests, even to the detriment of Portugal's. Reputedly unfaithful to her husband, she went as far as to plot his overthrow in league with dissatisfied Portuguese nobles.|$|E

5|$|Miller Huggins, {{who served}} as the Yankees' manager through 1929, had {{attempted}} to acquire Ruffing from the Red Sox for the last couple years of his Yankees' tenure. When Ruffing told him that he was considering moving to the outfield, Huggins told him he should continue as a pitcher. Bob Shawkey, a former pitcher who succeeded Huggins as the Yankees new manager in 1930, had convinced Ed Barrow, the Yankees' general manager, to acquire Ruffing. Shawkey believed he could change Ruffing's approach to pitching to obtain better results. Shawkey worked with Ruffing to change his pitching delivery, so that Ruffing used his body more. This helped Ruffing save his arm strength for the later innings of the game. The trade of Ruffing for Durst is now reckoned {{as one of the most}} lopsided trades in baseball history; Durst was a reserve outfielder <b>who</b> <b>always</b> batted at the bottom of the lineup when he was used. The 1930 season proved to be Durst's worst year in the majors. Ruffing had a 0–3 record with the Red Sox before the trade. He won 15 games for the Yankees after the trade, losing only five games.|$|E
5|$|On April 3, the Spanish {{approached}} the chiefdom of Altamaha, {{led by a}} chief named Zamuno, <b>who</b> <b>always</b> bore arms in case of attack by Cofitachequi. It is unclear if De Soto entered the main town at the Shinholser site. Zamuno exchanged gifts with De Soto {{and asked if he}} should pay tribute directly to him, instead of to his overlord Ocute. De Soto replied that the previous relationship should stand. De Soto erected a cross and left behind a cannon somewhere in the chiefdom. He summoned the paramount chief of Ocute, and then visited his main town, apparently at the Shoulderbone site, on April 9. He received gifts and set up another cross, and the army rested for two days. On April 12, De Soto visited another subject chiefdom, Cofaqui, which was governed by a young noble named Patofa on behalf of his elderly uncle. Patofa reiterated his compatriots' policy of amity and gave the army provisions and porters.|$|E
5|$|Hutton scored 2,049 runs at {{an average}} of 56.91 in the 1950 season. Batting {{effectively}} on a succession of early season rain-affected wickets, Hutton frequently top-scored for Yorkshire. Hutton's benefit match against Middlesex was affected by rain, but other events, collections and insurance for loss of play gave Hutton £9,713, a record at that point for a Yorkshire cricketer. Two-thirds of the amount was invested on Hutton's behalf by the Yorkshire committee, following their usual practice; Hutton resented this paternalism from the committee, particularly as he did not receive the full amount until 1972. Hutton played in three of the four Tests against West Indies. In the first Test, hampered by a finger injury, he scored 39 and 45 as England recorded their only victory of the series. The West Indies won the second Test, their first Test victory in England, and won the final two Tests to take the series 3–1; Hutton missed the third Test with lumbago but in the fourth Test scored 202 not out, carrying his bat through England's first innings. The West Indian spinners Sonny Ramadhin and Alf Valentine caused difficulties for all the batsmen except Hutton, <b>who</b> <b>always</b> appeared comfortable. Wisden praised his effort as unforgettable.|$|E

5|$|What {{followed}} {{was the first}} of three consecutive controversial and painful Game 7s in which Chamberlain played. In that Game 7, the Sixers could not get their act together: 15,202 stunned Philadelphia fans witnessed a historic 100–96 defeat, making it the first time in NBA history a team lost a series after leading three games to one. Although Cherry points out that the Sixers shot badly (Hal Greer, Wali Jones, Chet Walker, Luke Jackson and Matt Guokas hit a combined 25 of 74 shots) and Chamberlain grabbed 34 rebounds and shot 4-of-9, the center himself scored only 14 points. In the second half of Game 7, Chamberlain did not attempt a single shot from the field. Cherry observes a strange pattern in that game: in a typical Sixers game, Chamberlain got the ball 60 times in the low post, but only 23 times in Game 7, and only seven times in the third and only twice in the fourth quarter. Chamberlain later blamed coach Hannum for the lack of touches, a point which the coach conceded himself, but Cherry points out that Chamberlain, <b>who</b> <b>always</b> thought of himself as the best player of all time, should have been outspoken enough to demand the ball himself. The loss meant that Chamberlain was now 1–6 in playoff series against the Celtics.|$|E
