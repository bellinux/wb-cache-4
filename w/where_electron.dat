50|$|Modern {{valence bond}} theory replaces the {{overlapping}} atomic orbitals by overlapping valence bond orbitals that are expanded {{over a large}} number of basis functions, either centered each on one atom to give a classical valence bond picture, or centered on all atoms in the molecule.

50|$|Negative {{electron}} affinities {{can be used}} {{in those}} cases <b>where</b> <b>electron</b> capture requires energy, i.e. when capture can occur only if the impinging electron has a kinetic energy large enough to excite a resonance of the atom-plus-electron system. Conversely electron removal from the anion formed in this way releases energy, which is carried out by the freed electron as kinetic energy. Negative ions formed in these cases are always unstable. They may have lifetimes of the order of microseconds to milliseconds, and invariably autodetach after some time.|$|E

Because Jupiter's trapped electrons contain so much energy, they more easily diffuse across L-shells than trapped electrons in Earth's magnetic field. One consequence of this is a more continuous and smoothly-varying radio-spectrum emitted by trapped electrons in gyro-resonance.|$|E

50|$|The {{effect is}} {{important}} {{at the very}} large electron densities of the Sun <b>where</b> <b>electron</b> neutrinos are produced. The high-energy neutrinos seen, for example, in SNO (Sudbury Neutrino Observatory) and in Super-Kamiokande, are produced mainly as the higher mass eigenstate in matter ν2m, and remain as such as the density of solar material changes. (When neutrinos go through the MSW resonance the neutrinos have the maximal probability to change their nature, but it happens that this probability is negligibly small—this is sometimes called propagation in the adiabatic regime). Thus, the neutrinos of high energy leaving the sun are in a vacuum propagation eigenstate, ν2, that has a reduced overlap with the electron neutrino νe = ν1 cosθ + ν2 sinθ seen by charged current reactions in the detectors.|$|E
5000|$|Molecules {{interact}} {{at close}} range through intermolecular forces (the [...] "van der Waals forces"), which cause minute shifts of the electron density distributions (relative the distributions of electrons when the molecules are not interacting). Intermolecular forces are repulsive at near range, <b>where</b> <b>electron</b> exchange forces dominate the interaction, and attractive at somewhat greater separations, where the dispersion forces are active. (If separations are further increased, all intermolecular forces fall off rapidly and may be totally neglected.) Repulsion and attraction are due, respectively, to the small defects or excesses of electron densities of molecular complexes {{in the space between}} the interacting molecules, which often result in interaction-induced electric dipole moments that contribute some to interaction-induced emission and absorption intensities. The resulting dipoles are referred to as exchange force-induced dipole and dispersion force-induced dipoles, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Water-soluble {{diazonium}} salts {{react with}} carbon nanotubes via charge transfer {{in which they}} extract electrons from SWNT and form a stable covalent aryl bond. This covalent aryl bond forms with extremely high affinity for electrons with energies near the Fermi level, Ef of the nanotube. Metallic SWNT have a greater electron density near Ef resulting in their higher reactivity over semiconducting nanotubes. The reactant forms a charge-transfer complex at the nanotube surface, <b>where</b> <b>electron</b> donation from the latter stabilizes the transition state and accelerates the forward rate. Once the bond symmetry of the nanotube is disrupted by the formation of this defect, adjacent carbons increase in reactivity and initial selectivity for metallic SWNT is amplified. Under carefully controlled conditions this behavior can be exploited to obtain highly selective functionalization of metallic nanotubes to the near exclusion of the semiconductors.|$|E
