500|$|On her Twitter account, Courtney Love {{expressed}} {{her anger}} at Cobain's {{representation in the}} game and threatened legal action alongside other companies that represent Cobain's intellectual property.

In response to these statements, Activision claims it had secured all the proper publication rights for Cobain's image for the game. However, according to attorneys for Love, the contract was not meant to allow Activision to [...] "denigrate his image". Joystiq noted that the crux of the legal issues revolve around the [...] "right of personality", which is defined at the state level within the United States; these rights are presently held by Love due to her ownership of Cobain's estate, but may have been overridden in the contract with Activision.
