5|$|As far as Westmoreland was concerned, however, all {{he needed}} to know was that the NVA had massed large numbers of troops for a set-piece battle. Making the {{prospect}} even more enticing was that the base was in an unpopulated area <b>where</b> <b>American</b> firepower could be fully employed without civilian casualties. The opportunity to engage and destroy a formerly elusive enemy that was moving toward a fixed position promised a victory of unprecedented proportions.|$|E

50|$|At {{almost every}} {{location}} <b>where</b> <b>Americans</b> have fought overseas, {{in addition to}} the 25 federal monuments, many non-federal monuments commemorate their sacrifice. These sites are often little-known and poorly maintained. There are also simple markers and plaques which document the location of specific American actions on every European battlefield. These locations include the limits of advance of American combat divisions, the crash site <b>where</b> an <b>American</b> aircraft went down, or the exact location <b>where</b> an <b>American</b> service member was killed. The AWMO works to identify, document, and preserve these monuments, markers and plaques.|$|R
5|$|As {{human populations}} increase, {{and as they}} build houses in low-lying areas or fish or hunt near water, {{incidents}} are inevitable <b>where</b> <b>American</b> alligators intrude, or at least appear to intrude, on human life. Since 1948, 257 documented attacks on humans in Florida (about five incidents per year) have been reported, of which an estimated 23 resulted in death.

5|$|Immediately the American {{forces were}} hit with machine gun and mortar {{fire from the}} north ridge, where North Korean troops had been dug in.

Mott managed {{to make it to the}} ditch <b>where</b> <b>American</b> forces dug him a foxhole, but soon after all the Americans in his vicinity were killed or withdrew and he was left alone and unable to communicate with the rest of the battalion. North Korean forces had the US battalion in a crossfire on higher ground, both from the pass and from the ridge. Mortar fire knocked out many parked vehicles, including the radio jeep of a US Air Force tactical air-control party which was to direct airstrikes. During the fight two flights of US aircraft flew over the area trying in vain to contact the party, and when unable to do so, left the area without making any strikes.|$|E
5|$|Lochry's Defeat, {{also known}} as the Lochry massacre, was a battle fought on August 24, 1781, near present-day Aurora, Indiana, in the United States. The battle was part of the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), which began as a {{conflict}} between Great Britain and the Thirteen Colonies before spreading to the western frontier, <b>where</b> <b>American</b> Indians entered the war as British allies. The battle was short and decisive: about one hundred Indians of local tribes led by Joseph Brant, a Mohawk military leader who was temporarily in the west, ambushed a similar number of Pennsylvania militiamen led by Archibald Lochry. Brant and his men killed or captured all of the Pennsylvanians without suffering any casualties.|$|E
