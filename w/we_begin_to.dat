5|$|Oscar's {{viewpoint}} {{rises and}} looks at his body from above, and then <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> witness {{his life in a}} roughly chronological order. His loving parents were killed in a violent car crash; Oscar and Linda, devoted to each other, were sent to different foster homes; Oscar moved to Tokyo and earned money through drug dealing until he could afford to bring Linda to live with him; Oscar sleeps with his friend Victor's mother in return for extra money to help bring his sister over; Linda found work as a stripper for the nightclub owner Mario, to Oscar's distress; Oscar increased the scope of his dealing operations and started using potent psychedelics—in particular, DMT—more frequently; Alex discovered that Oscar slept with Victor's mother; and finally, we again see Oscar meet Victor at The Void to sell him drugs, only to be shot in the bathroom.|$|E
25|$|From the Holocaust, <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> {{understand}} {{the dangers of}} all forms of discrimination, prejudice, and bigotry; hatreds which, in their extreme forms, can lead to mass slaughter and genocide -- and, on the personal level, can endanger our ethical being.|$|E
25|$|It {{is after}} this that <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> find Mary Hanford Ford {{herself as a}} member of clubs. Circa 1880, Mary Hanford Ford was among a circle of women who formed the Friends Council Club in Kansas City, of {{intentionally}} limited number of members, and focused on reviewing the history, literature, philanthropy and art of early civilizations. Circa 1882, Ford was visible entertaining visitors. Another early club Ford was involved in was the Social Science Club; she was visible working with it in 1884. Ford's daughter Lynette was born on 6 June 1883.|$|E
60|$|At length, {{the poor}} Men <b>began</b> <b>to</b> be tir'd of us, and indeed <b>we</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> be tir'd of them; for <b>we</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> be afraid {{very much that}} they would prye a little Way into our Affairs, and that a little too {{narrowly}} that Way; so as they <b>began</b> <b>to</b> sollicit their Deliverance, <b>we</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> listen to their Importunities: In a Word, we agreed to dismiss them; and accordingly we gave them Leave to go away to the Watering-place, {{as if they had}} made their Escape from us; which they did, carrying away their Heads full of all those unlikely projected Things which you have heard above.|$|R

25|$|Kant {{himself did}} not see himself as a relativist, and was aiming to give {{knowledge}} a more solid basis, but as Richard J. Bernstein remarks, reviewing this same critique of Gadamer:Once <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> question {{whether there is a}} common faculty of taste (a sensus communis), we are easily led down the path to relativism. And this is what did happen after Kant - so much so that today it is extraordinarily difficult to retrieve any idea of taste or aesthetic judgment that is more than the expression of personal preferences. Ironically (given Kant's intentions), the same tendency has worked itself out with a vengeance with regards to all judgments of value, including moral judgments.|$|E
25|$|Religion, Unger argues, is {{a vision}} of the world within which we anchor our {{orientation}} to life. It is within this orientation that we deal with our greatest terrors and highest hopes. Because we are doomed to die, we hope for eternal life; because we are unable to grasp to totality of existence or of the universe, we try to dispel the mystery and provide a comprehensible explanation; because we have an insatiable desire, we cry for an object that is worthy of this desire, one that is infinite. Humans initially invested religious discourse in nature and the human susceptibility to nature. But as societies evolved and people developed ways to cope with the unpredictability of nature, the emphasis of religion shifted to social existence and its defects. A new moment in religion will begin, Unger argues, when we stop telling ourselves that all will be fine and <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> face the incorrigible flaws in human existence. The future of religion lies in embracing our mortality and our groundlessness.|$|E
500|$|Circa 1800 BC, the Norte Chico civilization {{began to}} decline, with more {{powerful}} centers appearing {{to the south}} and north along the coast, and to the east inside the belt of the Andes. Norte Chico's success at irrigation-based agriculture may have contributed to its being eclipsed. One researcher notes that [...] "when this civilization is in decline, <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> find extensive canals farther north. People were moving to more fertile ground and taking their knowledge of irrigation with them." [...] It would be a thousand years before the rise of the next great Peruvian culture, the Chavín.|$|E

500|$|Rhinehart {{describes}} the est {{training as a}} form of participatory theatre, writing: [...] "Seeing the trainer as a master actor ... permits us to evaluate his acts and words more intelligently than if we misinterpret him as being a scholar or scientist giving a lecture." [...] In an analysis of how to approach the est training, Rhinehart comments that [...] "It might best be described, if it can be described at all, as theater—as living theater, participatory theater, encounter theater. Once <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> see est in these terms, much that fails to fit the scheme of therapy or religion or science begins to make sense." ...|$|E
500|$|Latin American {{literature}} scholar, Jacqueline Stefanko, {{along with}} several of her peers, has made pointed mention of the significant implications Yolanda’s multiple nicknames hold for her fragile and fragmented sense of self. Stefanko observes that [...] "as Yolanda's names proliferate on the page, <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> see the multiplicity of her identity [...] realize the struggle Yolanda must engage in to not be fragmented {{in a society that}} marginalizes her". Scholar William Luis reinforces the notion that Yolanda’s shattered identity stems largely from the [...] "multiple names used [...] She is Yolanda, Yoyo, Yosita, Yo and, last but not least the English Joe. And above all, she is 'Yo,' the Spanish first person pronoun, the 'I' of the narrator." ...|$|E
500|$|.....the {{animal is}} at once awkward, flimsy, strange, bouncy in flight, yet {{beautiful}} and immensely sympathetic; it is painfully transient, albeit capable of extreme migrations and transformations. Images and phrases such as [...] "kaleidoscopic instabilities," [...] "oxymoron of similarities," [...] "rebellious rainbows," [...] "visible darkness" [...] and [...] "souls of stone" [...] have much in common. They bring together the two terms of a conceptual contradiction, thereby facilitating the mixing of what should be discrete and mutually exclusive categories... In positing such questions, butterfly science, an inexhaustible, complex, and finely nuanced field, becomes not unlike the human imagination, or the field of literature itself. In {{the natural history of}} the animal, <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> sense its literary and artistic possibilities." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before 1500, the Italian Renaissance {{had little}} or no {{influence}} above the Alps. After this <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> see Renaissance influences, but unlike the Italian Renaissance, Gothic elements remain important. The revival of the classical period is also not a central theme like in Italy, the [...] "rebirth" [...] shows itself more as a return to nature and earthly beauty.|$|E

2500|$|During the Six Dynasties period (220–589), {{people began}} to {{appreciate}} painting for its own beauty and to write about art.

[...] Even when these artists illustrated Confucian moral themes – such as the proper behavior of a wife to her husband or of children to their parents – they {{tried to make the}} figures graceful.|$|E

2500|$|As Europe {{continued}} to grow more prosperous, the urban middle classes, skilled workers, began to wear more complex clothes that followed, at a distance, the fashions set by the elites. It is in this time period that <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> see fashion take on a temporal aspect. People could now be dated by their clothes, and being in [...] "out of date" [...] clothing became a new social concern. National variations in clothing seem on the whole to have increased over the 15th century.|$|E
2500|$|The {{practical}} {{concerns of}} the ancient Greeks to establish a calendar is first exemplified by the Works and Days of the Greek poet Hesiod, who lived around 700 BC. [...] The Works and Days incorporated a calendar, in which the farmer was to regulate seasonal activities by the seasonal appearances and disappearances of the stars, {{as well as by}} the phases of the Moon which were held to be propitious or ominous. [...] Around 450 BC <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> see compilations of the seasonal appearances and disappearances of the stars in texts known as parapegmata, which were used to regulate the civil calendars of the Greek city-states on the basis of astronomical observations.|$|E
2500|$|Ossuaries {{have long}} been a known burial {{practice}} among the Ontario Iroquois. Early ethnohistoric accounts combined with archaeological, osteological research have provided a window into cultural aspects of Iroquoian death and burial {{as well as the}} larger social, economical and political context of the time. [...] Based on radiocarbon dates for three early Iroquoian ossuary pits a developed ossuary tradition had arisen by the A.D. 1000-1300 period. It is believed the ossuary tradition developed in response to an increased need for integration of members of different families for the purpose of agricultural production. At the same time, <b>we</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> see evidence of semi-subterranean sweat lodges appear in the archaeological record, and thought to have functioned to integrate men from different families within the community.|$|E
