2500|$|On December 21, 2011, Barnes & Noble accidentally shipped 1500 {{copies of}} The Fault in Our Stars before the release date {{to people who}} had pre-ordered the book. Green {{released}} a statement saying, [...] "Mistakes happen. The people who made this error were not bad or incompetent people, {{and they were not}} acting maliciously. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>make</b> mistakes, and it is not my wish to see Barnes and Noble or any of their employees vilified." [...] Many people who received the book pledged not to read it until its release date, January 10, 2012, or discuss it until the next day, January 11, as per a request of Green's not to spoil it for other readers. Most kept to this promise leaving the experience untarnished for those who got the book on the intended release date.|$|E
2500|$|... "Get Along" [...] {{deals with}} the damage inflicted by religious, racial and {{cultural}} intolerance, asking why the world can't just get along. It is a stripped back track with minimal instrumental accompaniment. Sebastian explained why he wrote the song, [...] "It sends your brain into overload when you are expecting your first child. It definitely makes you {{take a step back}} and try to gain some perspective on this world we live in". [...] "Big Bad World" [...] was written for his son Hudson who was born in March 2012. He said, [...] "It's about that promise <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>make</b> to our kids, but realise we don't have as much control as we think. We want to protect them from the big bad world, but the promise matters the most." [...] "Used to You" [...] is a song Sebastian wrote for his wife Jules. He said, [...] "I always say to her, 'I don't get used to you'. I still get back from tours and I'm still excited to see her. [...] We've been friends for 18 years, together for 13 years. I'm lucky".|$|E
6000|$|... "Aw! <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>make</b> {{mistakes}} {{some time}} in our lives," [...] said Belllounds, hurriedly. [...] "I made 'most as big a one as yours--so help me God!..." ...|$|E
60|$|SIR ROBERT CHILTERN. [Biting his lip.] I {{was mistaken}} {{in the view}} I took. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> may <b>make</b> mistakes.|$|R
5000|$|Manigault {{is quoted}} in the New York Times article 'A Fallen King Revisits His Realm' as saying [...] "For every Michael Jordan, there's an Earl Manigault. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> can't <b>make</b> it. Somebody has to fall. I was the one." ...|$|R
5000|$|... “Art {{itself has}} the {{potential}} to democratize aesthetics and reimagine aesthetic production as communal, available and non-hierarchical. I like the idea of demystifying aesthetics by communicating that <b>we</b> can <b>all</b> <b>make</b> aesthetic objects; it’s not simply for those with capital or power.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Godfrey thinks <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>make</b> {{too much}} of the matter," [...] my aunt remarked. [...] "He has just been saying that he doesn't care to speak of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{all there}} is to tell," [...] he concluded, artlessly; [...] "the cap'n was that ashamed of hisself, he's laying low for a bit. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>make</b> {{mistakes}} sometimes; I do myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why shouldn’t <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>make</b> {{an evening}} of it?" [...] ses Ginger, arter they ’ad been talking for about ten minutes, and the nevy ’ad {{looked at the clock}} three or four times.|$|E
6000|$|... "They're a dyngerous lot {{of people}} about this park. My word! it doesn't do to ply with them!" [...] he observed, in that rycy Austrylian English, which (as it has {{received}} the imprimatur of Mr. Froude) <b>we</b> should <b>all</b> <b>make</b> haste to imitate.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder <b>we</b> don't <b>all</b> <b>make</b> up {{our minds}} to remain single," [...] said Caroline. [...] "We should if {{we listened to}} the wisdom of experience. My uncle always speaks of {{marriage}} as a burden; and I believe whenever he hears of a man being married he invariably regards him as a fool, or, at any rate, as doing a foolish thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's to my taste, too," [...] {{said the}} captain, [...] "but {{it will be}} better for us to wait here and see what Maka has to say when he gets back. Perhaps, if Mr. Rynders doesn't turn up pretty soon, <b>we</b> will <b>all</b> <b>make</b> a trip down there. Where is Ralph? I don't want him to go with the men." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{just drop}} {{it out of}} your mind; it's no harm; <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>make</b> them. Pull your courage together, and don't brood, and don't give up. I'm at your back, and we'll pull through, don't you be afraid." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{take things}} {{too much to}} heart, Anne. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>make</b> {{mistakes}} [...] . but people forget them. And Jonah days come to everybody. As for Anthony Pye, why need you care if he does dislike you? He is the only one." ...|$|E
60|$|Ah, if Mr. Gladstone, or the Duke of Argyll, or some bishop {{had made}} a {{misstatement}} of this kind, how Mr. Huxley would have crushed him! But it is a mere error of careless reading, such as <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>make</b> daily.|$|E
6000|$|... "In spots, {{you might}} say--yes; though <b>we</b> <b>all</b> contributed to <b>make</b> up deficiencies. But Mr. Moorshed, not much carin' for further Navy after what Frankie said, {{certainly}} {{threw himself into}} the part with avidity." ...|$|R

2500|$|When {{asked in}} May 2012 {{about the future}} status of Army of Anyone, Luzier reiterated Patrick's {{comments}} {{that they were still}} in contact, and even stated there was music they were working on, responding, [...] "It’s possible. <b>We</b> are <b>all</b> really good friends. We have a bunch of tunes in the works. I think if the time ever arose where <b>we</b> <b>all</b> could <b>make</b> our schedules fit, it would work out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear fellow, of course! I am {{sure that}} {{a word or two}} from you will put {{everything}} right. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>make</b> mistakes. I have made them myself. I am convinced that everything will be perfectly all right.... Ah, there she is. Jill, my dear, here is an old friend to see you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>make</b> {{mistakes}}, dear, so {{just put}} it behind you. We should regret our mistakes and learn from them, but never carry them forward into the future with us. There goes Gilbert Blythe on his wheel [...] . home for his vacation too, I suppose. How are you and he getting on with your studies?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{had made}} a picture for yourself," [...] said Margaret gently. [...] "Yes, <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>make</b> {{pictures}} for ourselves, {{and we are the}} foremost figures in them; but they are taken out of our hands, and we see others putting in rude touches, and spoiling our work, as it seems; but, by-and-by, we shall see that it is all guided." ...|$|E
5000|$|The author {{also says}} a {{successful}} business leader must be self-disciplined. He needs to put hard work before leisure. This {{is usually the}} case to achieve scholastically whether in junior high (middle high school), high-school or at the university level. Nonetheless {{a word of caution}} is that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> must <b>make</b> time for rest, recreation and reflection (Page 46) to maintain good physical and mental health.|$|R
5000|$|The same year, Wine was {{appointed}} Parenting Ambassador by Twaweza, a NGO {{that focuses on}} education and citizen engagement in East Africa; his message in this partnership was to promote responsible parenting among his Ugandan fans. [...] "Education is what will ultimately {{change the course of}} our country and as an artiste and a father, I believe <b>we</b> can <b>all</b> <b>make</b> a difference in our children’s learning," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes: we {{have had}} a very {{pleasant}} evening indeed. We played chess and écarté; and <b>we</b> <b>all</b> agreed to <b>make</b> old times of it. Marmaduke sang for us; and Marian had us nearly in tears with those old ballads of hers." ...|$|R
60|$|Now I make {{my beliefs}} as I want them. I do {{not attempt to}} distil them out of fact as {{physicists}} distil their laws. I make them thus and not thus exactly as an artist makes a picture so and not so. I believe that is how <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>make</b> our beliefs, but that many people do not see this clearly and confuse their beliefs with perceived and proven fact.|$|E
60|$|JENNIFER [suddenly {{moved and}} softened] Oh, doctor, if you {{acknowledge}} that--if you have confessed it to yourself--if {{you realize what}} you have done, then there is forgiveness. I trusted in your strength instinctively at first; then I thought I had mistaken callousness for strength. Can you blame me? But if it was really strength--if it was only such a mistake as <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>make</b> sometimes--it will make me {{so happy to be}} friends with you again.|$|E
6000|$|LADY HUNSTANTON. Caroline, shall <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>make</b> {{a move to}} the music- room? Miss Worsley {{is going}} to play. You'll come too, dear Mrs. Arbuthnot, won't you? You don't know what a treat is in store for you. [To DOCTOR DAUBENY.] I must really take Miss Worsley down some {{afternoon}} to the rectory. I should so much like dear Mrs. Daubeny to hear her on the violin. Ah, I forgot. Dear Mrs. Daubeny's hearing is a little defective, is it not? ...|$|E
5000|$|... “Afrikanerhart {{is not a}} {{song that}} calls for any form of {{revolution}} or uprising. The song comes from the musical ‘Ons vir Jou’, and <b>all</b> that <b>we</b> {{want to say is}} that the Afrikaner also shed blood while building South Africa. If <b>we</b> respect <b>all</b> cultures and their history, <b>we</b> can together <b>all</b> <b>make</b> this country stronger.” (Translated from the original Afrikaans) ...|$|R
2500|$|The Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, {{stated that}} [...] "Syria should {{withdraw}} from Lebanon, but <b>we</b> <b>all</b> have to <b>make</b> {{sure that this}} withdrawal does not violate the very fragile balance which we still have in Lebanon, {{which is a very}} difficult country ethnically." ...|$|R
30|$|In this section, we mainly {{discuss some}} {{properties}} about the proposed algorithm, including {{the discussion of}} the error bounds, the sufficiently descent property, the global and local convergence properties. First of <b>all,</b> <b>we</b> <b>make</b> some necessary assumptions as follows.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{very kind}} of you, Mr. Merton Ware," [...] he confessed, [...] "to let me down so gently. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>make</b> mistakes, of course. As to my future intentions, well, I am not quite sure about them. You see, this isn't really my job at all. It isn't {{up to me to}} hunt out English criminals, so long as they behave {{themselves}} in this city. If an extradition order or anything of that sort came my way, it would, of course, be different." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{doubt you}} would, my dear sir, {{and like a}} wild cat too! <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>make</b> {{mistakes}} in judgment, in war, and in politics, and no fact is better known than that the best soldiers in the end are they who give a little ground at the first attack. But Mr. Leach has explained to you the plan of Mr. Monday, and I rely on your spirit and zeal, which there is now an excellent opportunity to prove, as before it was only demonstrated." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We do {{not mean}} to speak unkindly of your grandfather, my dear," [...] the squire said gently. [...] "I have never seen him, you know, and John has never seen him but once. I have thought, all these years, bitterly of him; but perhaps I have been mistaken. He has ever been kind and good to you, and, above all, he has given you back to me, and that will make me think {{differently}} of him, in future. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>make</b> mistakes, you know, and I have made terrible mistakes, and have been terribly punished for them. I daresay I have made a mistake here; but whether or no, you shall never hear a word, from me, against the man who has been so kind to you." ...|$|E
40|$|<b>We</b> can <b>all</b> now <b>make</b> YouTube {{videos and}} buy musical instruments, but this upsurge in ?homemade? culture should not blind {{us to the}} fact that access to {{publicly}} funded culture is still very limited, with only 4 per cent of the population enjoying the arts regularly. There is a thin line between defending quality and erecting barricades against outsiders, and it is not always clear where that line is. Sometimes ?maintaining standards? just means preserving status. The report asks what a ?democratic culture? in the arts would look like, and finds the current system wanting in terms of legislative frameworks, representation, transparency, equality, and universalism. Culture should be something that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> own and <b>make,</b> not something given, offered or delivered by one section of ?us? to another...|$|R
6000|$|... "This, of course, won't {{interfere}} with Lucinda's present," [...] said Mrs. Carbuncle,--"as <b>we</b> can <b>make</b> <b>all</b> this {{right by the}} horse and carriage account." [...] To this proposition, however, Lady Eustace made no answer.|$|R
2500|$|Many {{commentators}} {{argue that}} Vancouver's real-estate boom, {{which has been}} accused of increasing the divide between its rich and poor, is a bubble about to burst. [...] As of May 2008, Wall himself remained buoyant. [...] "I'm trying to keep the price down, [...] " [...] he remarked, [...] " [...] so that everybody can make a deal that's equitable, and then <b>we</b> can <b>all</b> <b>make</b> money. To live in B.C., you're lucky. To live in the Lower Mainland, you're very lucky. To live in Vancouver and own real estate, you have won the lottery".|$|R
