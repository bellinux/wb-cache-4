25|$|Pressure in {{the primary}} circuit is {{maintained}} by a pressurizer, a separate vessel that {{is connected to the}} primary circuit and partially filled with water which is heated to the saturation temperature (boiling point) for the desired pressure by submerged electrical heaters. To achieve a pressure of , the pressurizer temperature is maintained at 345°C (653°F), which gives a subcooling margin (the difference between the pressurizer temperature and the highest temperature in the reactor core) of 30°C (54°F). As 345°C is the boiling point of water at 155 bar, the liquid water is {{at the edge of a}} phase change. Thermal transients in the reactor coolant system result in large swings in pressurizer liquid/steam volume, and total pressurizer volume is designed around absorbing these transients without uncovering the heaters or emptying the pressurizer. Pressure transients {{in the primary}} coolant system manifest as temperature transients in the pressurizer and are controlled through the use of automatic heaters and <b>water</b> <b>spray,</b> which raise and lower pressurizer temperature, respectively.|$|E
