It is a way to make lines shorter only for the people with the Pass.

2500|$|By the 1990s, GM's {{program of}} sharing {{components}} across divisions {{that began in}} the 70s as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> costs grew into a marketing problem. After the 1984 reorganization forced teamwork by the divisions, parts sharing evolved into wholesale sharing of entire designs and simply re-badging vehicles for each division. Observers suggested that differences between automobiles produced and marketed by the Chevy, Buick, and Oldsmobile divisions were less distinct as a consequence. Automotive commentators cited a lack of a distinct brand identity and demographic changes as crucial factors in the demise of the Oldsmobile division in 2004. Compounding GM's problems was the fact that while entire platforms shared designs, the engineered parts beneath the surface, where customers didn't care or didn't notice were often not shared, which is where money could be saved. Analyst David Cole summed it up: [...] "The engineering was 180 degrees out of phase. GM cars looked alike outside but were all different inside." ...|$|E
