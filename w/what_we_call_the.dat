25|$|<b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> Sonneborn-Berger {{system was}} not invented by Sonneborn or Berger, {{and it was}} not {{originally}} designed for tie-breaking. It was invented by Oscar Gelbfuhs about 1873 {{to be used as a}} weighted score in round-robin tournaments. It would be used instead of the raw score for final places. In 1886 Sonneborn criticized the system and suggested an improvement that would give a better weighted score. His suggestion was to add the square of the player's points to the amount calculated as above. In 1887 and 1888 Berger studied Gelbfuhs' system and the suggestion of Sonneborn. This improvement became known as the Sonneborn-Berger system.|$|E

The director worked, in part, from Jean Marie Besset's play about the scandal, RER, as well as from news reports and court records.

And to bring a man to the understanding and feeling that faith only justifieth, Paul proveth that the whole nature of man is so poisoned and so corrupt, yea and so dead concerning godly living or godly thinking, that it is impossible for her to keep the law in the sight of God.|$|E
2500|$|However {{materials}} {{in which all}} three refractive indices are different are termed biaxial and {{the origin of this}} term is more complicated and frequently misunderstood. In a uniaxial crystal, different polarization components of a beam will travel at different phase velocities, except for rays in the direction of <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>call</b> <b>the</b> optic axis. Thus the optic axis has the particular property that rays in that direction do not exhibit birefringence, with all polarizations in such a beam experiencing the same index of refraction. It is very different when the three principal refractive indices are all different; then an incoming ray in any of those principle directions will still encounter two different refractive indices. But it turns out that there are two special directions (at an angle to all of the 3 axes) where the refractive indices for different polarizations are again equal. For this reason, these crystals were designated as biaxial, with the two [...] "axes" [...] in this case referring to ray directions in which propagation does not experience birefringence.|$|E
