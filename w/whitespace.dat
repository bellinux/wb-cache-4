5|$|Python uses <b>whitespace</b> {{indentation}} {{to delimit}} blocks – rather than curly braces or keywords.

5|$|Python is {{a widely}} used {{high-level}} programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notably using <b>whitespace</b> indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The TV <b>whitespaces</b> {{represent}} an incredible opportunity for innovation. Along with this opportunity come significant challenges: the <b>whitespaces</b> are very heterogeneous {{in terms of}} channel availability as well as quality. This poses a challenge to anyone wishing to achieve uniform or even similar quality of service nationwide. In this paper, we consider using heterogeneity in the emissions limits to counteract the inherent heterogeneity of the <b>whitespaces,</b> ultimately resulting in a more homogeneous quality of service for secondary users. However, heterogeneity cannot be added to regulations in a haphazard manner. Rather, it must be carefully crafted {{as a result of}} looking at the bigger picture and fully exploiting the capabilities of databases. Databases should not be seen as a necessary evil but rather as an exciting opportunity for improvement and innovation. In particular, rather than being viewed as a simple repository of data, the “database ” {{can be viewed as a}} cloudbased entity that reports the result of a default kind of Coasianbargaining that could be expected to occur among frequencyagile radios. We conclude by showing a few small examples of positive heterogeneity as it applies to real-world data for the TV <b>whitespaces</b> in parts of the United States. I...|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{function}} and class names, variable names are case sensitive. Both double-quoted ("") and heredoc strings provide {{the ability to}} interpolate a variable's value into the string. PHP treats newlines as <b>whitespace</b> {{in the manner of}} a free-form language, and statements are terminated by a semicolon. PHP has three types of comment syntax: /* */ marks block and inline comments; // as well as # are used for one-line comments. The echo statement is one of several facilities PHP provides to output text, e.g., to a web browser.|$|E
25|$|Limited <b>whitespace</b> {{is allowed}} and ignored around or between {{syntactic}} elements (values and punctuation, but not within a string value). Only four specific characters are considered <b>whitespace</b> for this purpose: space, horizontal tab, line feed, and carriage return. In particular, the byte order mark {{must not be}} generated by a conforming implementation (though it may be accepted when parsing JSON). JSON does not provide syntax for comments.|$|E

40|$|We {{explore the}} use of TV <b>whitespaces</b> based {{communication}} sys-tems for providing robust connectivity to vehicles. We envision a setup where <b>whitespaces</b> base stations mounted by roadside that communicate with <b>whitespaces</b> gateway nodes placed on vehicles. A key challenge in this setup is the asymmetry in transmission power limits – the fixed base station is allowed to communicate at up to 4 W, while the mobile gateways on vehicles are limited to 100 mW. This paper presents a specific network design called Scout {{to deal with this}} asymmetry in which <b>whitespaces</b> transceivers are used in the downlink direction while a more traditional cellular path is used in the uplink one. As the key component of this system, we describe a novel channel probing mechanism that sends a forward radio to look ahead and identify the best channel parameters to be used when the rear radio eventually reaches the forward post. We report various challenges and experience in this design and our on-going plans to use it for providing Internet access to public city buses. Our initial results indicate a 4 × coverage improvement and 1. 4 × throughput gain achieved by Scout. 1...|$|R

This document recommends that the 600MHz UHF band is allocated to DVB-T2 MPEG-4 Freeview HD services and <b>Whitespace</b> services, allowing a future migration of the existing 700MHz Freeview allocation to 700MHz mobile data services (synchronising the bandwidth usage with many other markets in Europe and globally).|$|E
25|$|Characters U+0800 through U+FFFF use three bytes in UTF-8, {{but only}} two in UTF-16. As a result, text in (for example) Chinese, Japanese or Devanagari will take more space in UTF-8 if {{there are more of}} these {{characters}} than there are ASCII characters. This is possible when data mainly consist of pure prose, but is lessened by {{the degree to which the}} context uses ASCII <b>whitespace,</b> digits, and punctuation.|$|E

[...] He manipulates the reader's focus with the variously-sized images, as in the small images that close in on the faces of the businessmen who surround the Elderly Gentleman.

In order to fulfil ever increasing demand for higher bandwidth, cognitive radio can exploit multiple <b>whitespaces</b> together to satisfy users' requirements by aggregating contiguous or fragmented portions of spectrum. In this paper, a novel genetic algorithm based spectrum aggregation scheme is proposed by taking into consideration the realistic constraints of co-channel interference and maximum aggregation span. Numerical results show that our method significantly increases the spectrum utilisation compared with the state-of-the-art solutions...|$|R
500|$|Perl {{has been}} {{referred}} to as [...] "" [...] by some programmers who claim its syntax makes it a write-only language. The earliest such mention was in the first edition of the book Learning Perl, a Perl 5 tutorial book written by Randal L. Schwartz, in the first chapter of which he states: [...] "Yes, sometimes Perl looks like line noise to the uninitiated, but to the seasoned Perl programmer, it looks like checksummed line noise with a mission in life." [...] He also stated that the accusation that Perl is a write-only language could be avoided by coding with [...] "proper care". The Perl overview document perlintro states that the names of built-in [...] "magic" [...] scalar variables [...] "look like punctuation or line noise". The perlstyle document states that line noise in regular expressions could be mitigated using the /x modifier to add <b>whitespace.</b>|$|E

50|$|Many LP {{products}} include extensions to the MPS format. The {{free format}} MPS allows for long names and more accurate data by allowing fields {{to exceed the}} columns defined by the original standard, and apply <b>whitespaces</b> as separators instead of fixed column positions (note that this makes some MPS files that included <b>whitespaces</b> as part of names to be no longer valid). Some extensions include adding new kind of data to the MPS file (e.g. sections to include objective sense, integrality requirements, quadratic data or advanced MIP modelling constructs). There is also a compressed MPSC file format. SMPS is a specialized extension, designed to represent stochastic programming problem instances, in use especially in research environments.|$|R
