5|$|The {{basement}} of the house initially served as the wine storage area. In 1867, the family had a one-and-a-half-story brick winery constructed. After 1900, when <b>wine</b> <b>grapes</b> were no longer grown commercially, this building served as a storage room. Rübel later converted it to a museum for Ramona visitors, complete with Del Valle family artifacts. In the 21st century it is used for storage of farm equipment and automobiles.|$|E
40|$|This study grades the <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> {{based on}} the data of {{physical}} and chemical indexes of <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> {{and the quality of}} wine in 2012 CUMCM. Since the physical and chemical indexes of <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> are numerous, we firstly adopt principal component analysis to select the main physical and chemical indexes which can represent most of the property of <b>wine</b> <b>grape.</b> Then, we take the comprehensive score of wine quality as the quality index of <b>wine</b> <b>grape.</b> Later, taking the contribution rate in principal component analysis and quality of wine as the fuzzy evaluation weights, we set up a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model for the grading of <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> according to the international standard of wine grade. The grades of the red and white <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> all belong to 3, 4 and 5 grade, respectively and the grading result can well prove that the quality of wine can reflect the quality of <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> to some extent...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MAgricAdmin (Agricultural Economics)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. The wine {{industry}} {{is one of}} the oldest commercial activities in South Africa. The South African <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> industry annually produces more than a million tonnes of grapes, making the country the ninth largest producer in the world. The total area under <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> production is divided into eight regions for administrative purposes. These boundaries are a legacy of the era of controlled marketing and there is continued meaningfulness of having various classifications such as ‘wine of origin’ scheme. The purpose of this study is to identify the factors that determine the producers’ choice of <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivars in the wine regions in South Africa. Time series data for the period 1990 - 2003 were used to estimate the parameters of linear regression models. Two equations for each <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivar in each region were postulated and estimated using Ordinary Least Squares as applied with Eviews. Further, a stepwise regression as applied in STATISTICA was used to eliminate the parameters that were not statistically significant at five percent significant level. In identifying the factors that determine the choice of <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivars in the regions, the results showed that each <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivar in each region has its own factors influencing the producers’ choice of that specific <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivar. Same <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivars in different regions similarly have its own factors determining the producers’ choice. The implication of this is that there are differences in terms of the requirements and types of crops and <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivars grown in each region. However, the most important result that emerged with regular frequency is that, the factors determining the producers’ choice of a specific <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivar for each region is price of other <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivars and competitive products in that wine region. The price of specific <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivars only had an influence on few <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivars. The implication is that the producers in South Africa appears to consider the prices of other <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivars and competitive products before making a choice of whether to plant or uproot a specific <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivar more than the price of the specific <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> cultivar. This supports the theory that farm prices play a key role in allocating resources and in rewarding efficient producers...|$|R
25|$|The grape shares some {{morphological}} similarities {{with the}} Savoy <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> Altesse {{and has been}} historically confused with the French <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> variety. In Hungary, Furmint is sometimes confused with Kéknyelű while {{on the island of}} Korčula, in Croatia, the grape has been confused with Pošip. The Romanian <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> Grasă de Cotnari and the Bosnian <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> Žilavka also shares several synonyms with Furmint and are, thusly, often confused with the grape.|$|R
5|$|By 1930, {{the wine}} {{industry}} had weakened {{due to the}} Great Depression and Prohibition. Many vineyards that survived by supplying the home market were located in California's Central Valley, a non-optimal environment for growing quality Zinfandel. Thus, the end of Prohibition left a shortage of quality <b>wine</b> <b>grapes,</b> and Zinfandel sank into obscurity as most was blended into undistinguished fortified wines. However, some producers remained interested in making single varietal red wines.|$|E
5|$|Home to Aboriginal {{groups for}} over 40,000 years, the Riverina was {{originally}} settled by Europeans in {{the mid-19th century}} as a pastoral region providing beef and wool to markets in Australia and beyond. In the 20th century, the development of major irrigation areas in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys {{has led to the}} introduction of crops such as rice and <b>wine</b> <b>grapes.</b> The Riverina has strong cultural ties to Victoria, and the region was the source of much of the impetus behind the federation of Australian colonies.|$|E

50|$|Brugnola {{is a red}} Italian <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> {{variety that}} is grown in the Lombardy wine region of Valtellina. While historically, Brugnola {{was thought to be}} a local synonym for Emilia-Romagna <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> Fortana, DNA {{analysis}} has shown that the two grapes are distinct variety and that, instead, Brugnola shares a close genetic relationship with the Piedmont <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> Nebbiolo.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, DNA {{analysis}} confirmed what ampelographers such as Pierre Galet had long suspected--that the German/Swiss <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> Siedentraube and the French <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> Lignan blanc {{were in fact}} Luglienga. DNA also showed that Luglienga shares a parent-offspring relationship with the Valle d'Aosta <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> Prié blanc with the older Luglienga likely being the parent variety.|$|R
5|$|Mason avoided overdependence {{on tobacco}} {{as a source}} of income by leasing much of his land {{holdings}} to tenant farmers, and diversified his crops to grow wheat for export to the British West Indies as Virginia's economy sank because of tobacco overproduction in the 1760s and 1770s. Mason was a pioneer in the Virginia wine industry, subscribing along with other Virginians such as Thomas Jefferson to Philip Mazzei's scheme for growing <b>wine</b> <b>grapes</b> in America.|$|E
5|$|The Champagne {{province}} {{is located}} near the northern limits of the wine world along the 49th parallel. The high altitude and mean annual temperature of 10°C (50°F) creates a difficult environment for <b>wine</b> <b>grapes</b> to fully ripen. Ripening is aided {{by the presence of}} forests which helps to stabilize temperatures and maintain moisture in the soil. The cool temperatures serve to produce high levels of acidity in the resulting grape which is ideal for sparkling wine.|$|E
5|$|The Abbot-Emeritus of the Abbey of New Clairvaux, Fr.Thomas X.Davis, OCSO, {{first saw}} the stones and pictured them {{reassembled}} as a monastery on September 15, 1955—his first day in California. He arrived that day in San Francisco {{to serve as a}} new monk in Vina, California, at the monastery of Our Lady of New Clairvaux. The monastery belonged to Trappists of the order known as Cistercians of the Strict Observance. The monks farmed and worshiped on land once used by Leland Stanford to grow <b>wine</b> <b>grapes.</b> Davis's superior met him at the airport and drove him through Golden Gate Park where he stopped to show Davis the stones sitting among the weeds. From time to time in subsequent years, Davis inspected the stones only to find them in increasingly poor condition.|$|E

25|$|In 1872, the {{sparkling}} wine Cava {{was invented in}} the Penedès region and eventually became an internationally recognized wine style. When phylloxera hit the region {{towards the end of}} the 19th century, Catalonia's vineyards comprised over 80% red <b>wine</b> <b>grapes.</b> The growing Cava industry encouraged planting of more white <b>wine</b> <b>grapes,</b> in place of the diseased red rootstock, where they now make up nearly 70% of the region's vineyards.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the world's wine producing regions lie between the temperate latitudes of 30° and 50° in both hemispheres with regions lying closer to the equator typically harvesting earlier due to their warmer climates. In the Northern Hemisphere, vineyards in Cyprus begin harvesting as early as July. In California some sparkling <b>wine</b> <b>grapes</b> are harvested in late July to early August at a slightly unripe point to help maintain acidity in the wine. The {{majority of}} Northern Hemisphere harvesting occurs in late August to early October with some late harvest <b>wine</b> <b>grapes</b> being harvested throughout the autumn. In Germany, the United States and Canada, ice <b>wine</b> <b>grapes</b> can be harvested as late as January. In the Southern Hemisphere harvest can begin as early as January 1 {{in some of the}} warmer climate sites in New South Wales, Australia. The majority of Southern Hemisphere harvesting occurs between the months of February and April with some cool climate sites like Central Otago, New Zealand picking late harvest <b>wine</b> <b>grapes</b> in June.|$|E
25|$|Anthocyanins are {{phenolic}} compounds {{found throughout the}} plant kingdom, being frequently responsible for the blue to red colors found in flowers, fruits and leaves. In <b>wine</b> <b>grapes,</b> they develop during the stage of veraison when the skin of red <b>wine</b> <b>grapes</b> changes color from green to red to black. As the sugars in the grape increase during ripening so does the concentration of anthocyanins. In most grapes anthocyanins are found only in the outer cell layers of the skin, leaving the grape juice inside virtually colorless. Therefore, to get color pigmentation in the wine, the fermenting must {{needs to be in}} contact with the grape skins in order for the anthocyanins to be extracted. Hence, white wine can be made from red <b>wine</b> <b>grapes</b> {{in the same way that}} many white sparkling wines are made from the red <b>wine</b> <b>grapes</b> of Pinot noir and Pinot Meunier. The exception to this is the small class of grapes known as teinturiers, such as Alicante Bouschet, which have a small amount of anthocyanins in the pulp that produces pigmented juice.|$|E
50|$|Pollera nera {{is a red}} Italian <b>wine</b> <b>grape</b> {{variety that}} is grown {{primarily}} in the Liguria wine region and northwest Tuscany.

25|$|At {{one point}} {{it was thought}} that Pedro Ximénez was related (or {{possibly}} identical) to the German <b>wine</b> <b>grapes</b> Elbling and/or Riesling but in addition to DNA evidence disproving a relationship, viticultural evidence had shown for many decades that Pedro Ximénez requires a much warmer climate that most German <b>wine</b> <b>grapes</b> in order to fully ripen and was, thus, not likely to be closely related to any German wine variety. Other grapes that are sometimes confused with Pedro Ximénez include the Portuguese wine grape Galego Dourado which shares several synonyms with Pedro Ximénez and was confused with the vine in South Africa and the Argentine wine grape Pedro Giménez which also shares several synonyms.|$|E
