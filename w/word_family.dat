Such a dictionary may be expanded by adding meanings of derived and compound words and their use in discourse, thus making it very similar in terms od its usefulness to the monolingual national dictionary, except that the alphabetical system of organisation is replaced by the word-family one. It could also serve as a source for the production of a students 2 ̆ 7 word-information dictionary, which would selectively reduce the <b>word</b> <b>families</b> depending on the frequency of derived and compound words as verified in a text corpus.

30|$|Our review {{indicates}} {{that there is a}} lack of key information about the vocabulary requirements and that the requirements do not form an inherently coherent system. First, it is not clear whether the vocabulary sizes are cumulative across educational stages or each stage is independent of the others.

Words of food and fruit such as “pancake”, “dumpling”, “cherry”, and “watermelon”, for example, appear in the wordlist of junior secondary curriculum, but not that of the non-English-major undergraduate curriculum. Second, no information is available as to whether lexical items in the lists are <b>word</b> <b>families</b> or lemmas. Data provided on the Language Data (2016) shows that they are certainly not <b>word</b> <b>families.</b> In the 700 items of the vocabulary list for elementary education, for example, there are only 404 <b>word</b> <b>families.</b> Third, core lexical items or items new to each educational stage are not indicated, making it difficult for teachers, textbook writers and assessment developers to focus on the items essential to education at a particular stage.|$|R
