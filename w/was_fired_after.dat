He led the team to two more conference titles (1916–17, 1918–19), and one consensus retroactive national championship for the 1918–19 season, but the team was never the consistent winner {{that it was in}} the first decade under Cooke.

Richie left in August 1987, upset that {{after being in}} the band for five years, the other members would still not give him {{a share of the}} money they made selling T-shirts. Richie was replaced by Clem Burke from Blondie, which was disbanded at the time. According to Johnny, the performances with Burke—who adopted the name Elvis Ramone—were a disaster. He <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> <b>after</b> two performances (August 28 & 29, 1987) because his drumming could not keep up {{with the rest of the}} band. In September, Marky, now clean and sober, returned to the band.|$|E
5|$|Through the 1991 season, it {{was clear}} that the team's core players on defense had aged quickly. This {{deterioration}} continued in 1992, when Lawrence Taylor ruptured his Achilles tendon in the team's tenth game, and the Giants promptly lost six out of their last seven games to finish the year 6–10. The defense continued its descent, finishing 26th in the league in points allowed after leading the league in that category in 1990. Handley, who had become unpopular with both players and fans, <b>was</b> <b>fired</b> <b>after</b> the end of the regular season.|$|E
