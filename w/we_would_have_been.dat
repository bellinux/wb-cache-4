5|$|Because if we'd gone to Baghdad <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> all alone. There wouldn't {{have been}} anybody else with us. There {{would have been}} a U.S. {{occupation}} of Iraq. None of the Arab forces that were willing to fight with us in Kuwait were willing to invade Iraq. Once you got to Iraq and took it over, took down Saddam Hussein's government, then {{what are you going to}} put in its place? That's a very volatile part of the world, and if you take down the central government of Iraq, you could very easily end up seeing pieces of Iraq fly off: part of it, the Syrians would like to have to the west, part of it—eastern Iraq—the Iranians would like to claim, they fought over it for eight years. In the north you've got the Kurds, and if the Kurds spin loose and join with the Kurds in Turkey, then you threaten the territorial integrity of Turkey. It's a quagmire if you go that far and try to take over Iraq. The other thing was casualties. Everyone was impressed with the fact we were able to do our job with as few casualties as we had. But for the 146 Americans killed in action, and for their families—it wasn't a cheap war. And the question for the president, in terms of whether or not we went on to Baghdad, took additional casualties in an effort to get Saddam Hussein, was how many additional dead Americans is Saddam worth? Our judgment was, not very many, and I think we got it right.|$|E
25|$|During {{his playing}} days, Shahid {{was known for}} his running ability, {{dribbling}} of the ball and push which was as fast as a hard hit. His attacking partnership on the field with Zafar Iqbal was well known."Zafar at left-out and Shahid at right-in positions penetrated the best of the defences around the world with their superb understanding and passing of the ball. Zafar also pointed that Shahid was instrumental in the V. Baskaran-led India winning the gold medal at the 1980 Olympics Games. “Shahid played a crucial role for India in that Olympics, otherwise <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> difficulty,” Zafar, who was part of that team, pointed."He was awarded the 'Best Forward player' at the 1980 Champions Trophy in Karachi. He {{was a member of the}} team that won the gold at the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, silver at the 1982 Asian Games and bronze at the 1986 Asian Games. He also played in the World Cup in Mumbai (then Bombay) in 1981–82, the Los Angeles Olympic Games in 1984 and the Seoul Games in 1988.|$|E
25|$|At 7 in {{the evening}} of November 28 {{occurred}} a new paroxysm, during which the volcano vomited forth such masses of fire and ejecta that in my opinion, all the material ejected during so many months, if taken together, would not equal the quantity which issued at the time. The columns of fire and smoke ascended higher than ever before, increasing every moment in volume, and setting fire to the whole island, there being not the smallest portion of the latter which was {{not covered by the}} smoke and the glowing rocks and ashes. All this was accompanied by terrific lightning and thunder above, and violent shocks of earthquakes underneath. The cloud of ejecta, carried on by the wind, extended itself toward west and south with the result that we saw already some stones fall close to our shore. I, therefore, shouted to all those who were still in the town to take to flight and we all ran off in a hurry; otherwise <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> engulfed on the spot; as the waves of the angry lake began already to flood the houses nearest to the beach.|$|E

500|$|While {{opening the}} Victorian Returned Services League Conference {{shortly before his}} {{retirement}} as Lieutenant Governor, Herring criticised anti-war protesters and praised Australian soldiers who {{had served in the}} Vietnam War. [...] "People who throw stones at Americans," [...] he said, [...] "should stop and think where <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> in 1942 without the Americans."

500|$|In summer 1902 Borchgrevink was one {{of three}} geographers invited by the National Geographic Society (NGS) to report on the after-effects of the catastrophic eruptions of Mount Pelée, on the French-Caribbean island of Martinique. These eruptions, in May 1902, had {{destroyed}} the town of Saint-Pierre, with enormous loss of life. Borchgrevink visited the island in June, when the main volcanic activity had subsided, and found the mountain [...] "perfectly quiet", and the islanders recovered from their panic. However, he did not think that Saint-Pierre would ever be inhabited again. He reported a narrow escape when, {{at the foot of the}} mountain, a jet of steam came out of the ground over which he and his party had just passed: [...] "If it had struck any one of us <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> scalded to death". He later presented his report to the NGS in Washington.|$|E

About 45minutes before the attack, Schrieber cut the power to the left engine at [...] over the camp.

Schneber repeated this several times while also performing various aerobatic maneuvers. The ruse continued for twenty minutes, creating a diversion for the Rangers inching their way toward the camp on their bellies. Prince later commended the pilots' actions: [...] "The idea of an aerial decoy was a little unusual and honestly, I didn't think it would work, not in a million years. But the pilot's maneuvers were so skillful and deceptive that the diversion was complete. I don't know where <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> without it." [...] As the plane buzzed the camp, Lt. Carlos Tombo and his guerrillas along with {{a small number of}} Rangers cut the camp's telephone lines to prevent communication with the large force stationed in Cabanatuan.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Harvest Festival" [...] episode {{featured}} {{an elaborate}} festival setting and corn maze sets. Due to budget restraints, the Parks and Recreation set department did not build the set, but instead used a real-life setting at Los Angeles Pierce College, {{a community college}} in California which holds an annual festival event. Michael Schur said the aerial shot of the harvest festival {{at the end of}} the episode was the most expensive shot in the entire series. The episode was filmed out of sequence from the rest of the season so the weather would be cooler when the scenes were shot; Schur jokingly said if this was not done, [...] "the week that <b>we</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> shooting it was like 148 degrees here and the actors would be dead now". The Eagleton public forum scene in the episode [...] "Eagleton" [...] was shot at the Toluca Lake Sports Center in the Toluca Lake district of Los Angeles. The season finale [...] "Li'l Sebastian" [...] saw the introduction of the headquarters for Tom and Jean-Ralphio's new company, Entertainment 720. The setting was a completely white [...] room with modern decor and unusual furniture, and Michael Schur described the setting as, [...] "Maybe the craziest thing that's ever been on our series ... It's truly nuts. It's like a hallucinogenic nightmare." ...|$|E

Shortly after the episode aired, a [...] "Producer's Cut" [...] version was made available on the official NBC website. It was about five minutes longer than the televised version and included several scenes that were originally cut due to length limitations, including an extended cold open with the parks department meeting Li'l Sebastian, and additional scenes of Leslie meeting with Pawnee constituents before the Harvest Festival.|$|E

Story piece pictures come in two types, independent and relative pictures. They correspond to independent and relative quantities in the Triplet Structure Model. Independent pictures are usually composed of stationary objects. Relative pictures will usually describe an action, like a boy inserting objects somewhere or an animal entering a place. By describing an action or movement, we can convey the same idea as the relative quantities of the Triplet Structure Model. We can be confident in the children’s interpretations of the pictures because very similar designs {{are used in the}} textbooks used in Japanese schools.|$|R
