40|$|Abstract- The {{objective}} of the paper is to study different parameters involve in building a Scaffolding system for High ‐ Rise Structures for supporting formworks, working platform and passageway for material logistics etc. The study also includes analysis of design guidelines for safe erection of scaffolding system. Scaffolding is the structure used or intended to use for supporting framework, swinging stage, suspended stage or protection of workers engaged in or in connection with construction work, {{for the purpose of}} carrying out that work or for the support of material transportation from one level to other or connection with any such <b>work.</b> <b>Scaffolding</b> system is defined as the planning for the design, erection and the inspection of the use and the dismantling of any scaffolding. By law, worker must have safe working environment. And most construction work involves working at heights which cannot be safely or easily reached from the ground or part of the building. The scaffolding design criteria consider the strength; stability; rigidity of the supporting structure and the safety of persons engaged in the erection, alteration and dismantling of the scaffold. When any material is transferred on or to a scaffold it shall be moved or deposited without imposing any violent shock. Scaffold system shall be properly maintained and every part shall be kept so fixed, secured or placed in a position as to prevent, as far as is practicable, accidental displacement. Thus, it must be designed for the most adverse combination of dead loads, live loads, impact loads and environmental loads that can reasonably be expected during the service life of scaffolding. The detail report considers design criteria given by various designing standards...|$|E

The {{conservation}} and technical examination of Johann Köler’s fresco Come unto Me, All…Keywords: fresco painting, artist’s technique, artistic practice, technical conditions of th e painting, conservationSummary:The {{article focuses on}} the artist’s technique in Johann Köler’s apse painting in the fresco technique, and the resulting conservation problems. In 2013, a technical examination was made and conservation-restoration work carried out on the altarpiece by Johan Köler in the apse of Kaarli Church in Tallinn. This was the first complete conservation of the painting since its completion. In order to conduct the conservation <b>work,</b> <b>scaffolding</b> was installed {{in front of the}} painting, which is locatedat a height that is normally inaccessible. In addition to making the conservation work possible, this also made it possible to conduct a thorough technical examination of the work. Since, in the local context, this is a unique painting in fresco technique, the wet layer of plaster had stored a large amount of information. “Reading” of this information provides insight into the artist’s work methods and an interpretation of the marks left by the author. In the course of the research, the following features were identified: the artist’s handprint pressed into the wet plaster, the time sequence of the execution of the painting, the number of individual plaster areas, the location of the structural lines used in the preparation of the work, the various methods used to transfer the outlines from the 1 : 1 cartoons, etc. CV:Hilkka Hiiop (PhD) is head of Conservation Departement in Art Museum of Estonia and responsible of contemporary art conservation in Kumu Art Museum.

His accomplishments concerning this principle of construction have been honoured with several prizes in and outside the country. In 1974 Roland founded the company “Conrad Roland Spielbau”, which planned and constructed rope play equipment and climbing nets from 1974 until 1985. The succeeding corporation COROCORD Raumnetz GmbH has been carrying the initial letters of his name in the corporate name until today.Already in 1975 the “Super Two Mast Spacenet” came into being for the Federal Horticultural Show (BUGA) in Mannheim, Germany.For the BUGA in Düsseldorf in 1987 Roland constructed the biggest Spacenet of the world until today, the “Super Four Mast Spacenet” in Südpark Düsseldorf, which is still in use after remedial maintenance in 2007.Predominantly, {{the architect}} developed Spacenets for playgrounds. In his publication, such as the patent specification for “Spatial Networks” in 1974, Conrad Roland revealed the multitude of applicability of the Spacenets: e.g. multi-level sun terraces, trellis, summer houses, beach and exhibition pavilions or as frame structure for exhibition spaces and sales areas, seat and reclining furniture and also <b>work</b> <b>scaffoldings.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{level of}} {{instructional}} guidance {{also has a}} significant impact on the benefits of the use of manipulatives (Carbonneau et al., 2013). A meta-analysis of 108 studies that compared different types of instructional approaches found that unassisted discovery resulted in poor learning outcomes relative to providing instructional support (Alfieri, Brooks, Aldrich, & Tenenbaum, 2011), findings that align with an earlier review that indicated that guided discovery was more effective than pure discovery in helping students learn and transfer (Mayer, 2004). In particular, findings suggest that unassisted discovery does not benefit learners, whereas feedback, <b>worked</b> examples, <b>scaffolding,</b> and elicited explanations do (Alfieri et al., 2011). Explanations for this include the possibilities that more guided tasks lower the demands on working memory and executive functioning abilities to allow learners to direct those efforts to problem-solving processes (Kirschner, Sweller, & Clark, 2006).|$|R

40|$|Mobile Elevating Work Platforms (MEWPs) are {{increasingly}} used for Work at Height operations in alternative to temporary <b>works</b> (<b>scaffoldings,</b> lad-ders,…) {{for a large}} variety of refurbishment and maintenance operations of buildings and fittings. MEWPs are often preferred over traditional tech-niques due to their impressive features of mobility, flexibility, cost and time reduction. But the number of accidents occurred during the use of MEWPs should not be underestimated: ac-cording to international databases, approximately 200 fatal accidents / year occur due to machines overturn, electrocution, fall from height, stability problems and overrun of the performance limits. Specialized operators are required for MEWPs (Italian law D. Lgs 81 / 08, art. 73, par. 5 provides for specific Information Formation and Training for some categories of equipment, including the MEWPs). In spite of that, both in routine operations and in emergency conditions, a not negligible num-ber of Hazard Factors can be identified such as over-confidence, unconsidered modus operandi due to haste, lack of preliminary inspections and function checks, poor maintenance and sometimes incom-pleteness of instruction handbooks. Moreover, the widespread practice of rent without operator of the MEWPs for temporary operations appears to lay at very the base of many accidents. The Authors analysed, within Prosecutor investi-gations, a number of fatal accidents involving MEWPs, and in the present paper the case histories are discussed with reference to: the criteria of selection among different ty-pologies of MEWPs, taken into account the most suitable operating characteristics and parameters for both common and special working conditions (sup-porting structures, working heights, rated capacities, outreaches,…); the Hazard Identification techniques suitable {{to point out the}} main possible operating deviations, to implement preventive measures for an effective MEWP Risk Assessment and Management; the basics of operators Information, For-mation and Training, to grant them appropriate knowledge of the various categories of MEWPs and the machines correct use, typical misuses and criti-calities in different yard situations; the paramount importance of maintenance in accordance with the provisions of the Italian trans-position of European Directives and the C-type standards, and the involved responsibilities in case of rented machines,; the familiarization of trained workers, essen-tial to a user-friendly utilization of the particular MEWPs model both in ordinary work and emergen-cy situations; the essential need of completeness and intel-ligibility of the machine accompanying documents, with special reference to the instruction handbook, for a correct and clear informatio...|$|R

Distinctive complexes have been described in the cell membrane of different tissues and cultured cells. In this work, we report the identification and characterization of a novel DAPC present in the nuclei of HeLa cells, which contains dystrophin Dp 71 as a key component. Using confocal microscopy and cell fractionation analyses, we found the presence of Dp 71, beta-sarcoglycan, beta-dystroglycan, alpha- and beta-syntrophin, alpha 1 - and beta-dystrobrevin and nNOS in the nuclei of HeLa cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation experiments {{that most of these}} proteins form a complex in the nuclear compartment. Next, we analyze the possible association of the nuclear DAPC with the nuclear matrix.

30|$|In four {{articles}} out of 18, guidance {{was described}} as a process of scaffolding and fading (Evanciew and Rojewski 1999; Filliettaz 2011; Nielsen 2008; Tanggaard 2005). Nielsen 2008) defines scaffolding as “a process whereby beginners in a profession are supported by experienced workers so as to improve their basis for participating in a social practice”. Through the scaffolding process, newcomers are introduced to new areas of the profession and eventually invited to take over more responsibility in the production process. Scaffolding includes the gradual withdrawal of support as the beginner’s skills improve (fading). The articles covered in this review described the apprentices as assuming increasing responsibility and enjoying progressive recognition as legitimate and trustworthy members of the <b>work</b> community. <b>Scaffolding</b> can thus be seen as supporting the identity formation of apprentices (Filliettaz 2011; Nielsen 2008). Nielsen (2008) states that scaffolding can also serve to communicate bodily know-how (non-verbal scaffolding) to apprentices. A significant part of what is being learned in craft production requires for the apprentice to develop a bodily sense of the products. Scaffold instruction enables apprentices to observe and touch the product, and together with the master to evaluate its quality. Tanggaard (2005) describes the typical scaffolding situations as often representing a more asymmetrical relationship between the experienced and the not so experienced workers, which can sometimes lead to the apprentice not being critical towards existing practices.|$|R
