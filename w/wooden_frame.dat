5|$|Joust was {{developed}} by Williams Electronics, with John Newcomer as the lead designer. Programmer Bill Pfutzenrueter and artists Jan Hendricks and Python Anghelo assisted him. Tim Murphy and John Kotlarik handled the audio design. The game features amplified monaural sound and raster graphics on a 19-inch color CRT monitor. Like other Williams arcade games, Joust was programmed in assembly language. A pack of three AA batteries provide power to save the game's settings and high scores when the machine is unplugged from an electrical outlet. The cabinet artwork, by Anghelo, is stenciled on a <b>wooden</b> <b>frame.</b> Anghelo also designed artwork for promotional materials; one such flyer featured archaic English, which was also incorporated into the game's onscreen instructions and game-over message.|$|E
5|$|The cloth {{support is}} visible {{in areas where the}} paint was thinly applied. Rusty nail holes {{can be seen in the}} lower border and across the top of the picture in an area of sky that was {{initially}} covered by frame. They indicate that the woodworking was positioned much lower than Bouts had intended; generally works painted on commission were placed by professional joiners who worked independently of the painter. The low placing of the frame however protected the underlying colours over the centuries from light; they are preserved as first laid down. The panel was originally attached to its frame by pegs and nails; the nails would have been used to attach the linen to the underlying <b>wooden</b> <b>frame.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to Abdul Baqir Zein, {{the mosque}} was first built in 1700 {{at the foot}} of Mount Padang, then moved to the bank of Batang Arau, as the Dutch colonial {{government}} intended to use the previous location to build a road to Emma Haven Port. It was later moved to its present location. However, the Indonesian Department of Religion documents the mosque as having been constructed in 1790 with a <b>wooden</b> <b>frame</b> and a roof made from Sago palms. According to this documentation, a sturdier mosque was built in 1805. Another history of the mosque, from the Culture and Tourism Department of the City of the Padang, suggests that the mosque was first constructed in 1805. The small mosque had stone flooring, wood and dirt walls, and a pyramidal ceiling like the mosques in Java.|$|E

5|$|Cave 1 {{is divided}} into four parts: a veranda, a middle room, a cell, and a half cell. The veranda has a bench along the right wall. Its front {{possibly}} had two quadrangular pillars, traces of one are seen around the ceiling. A rock beam was present over the pillars, above the beam ribs and a rail pattern could have existed. In a recess below the veranda is an earth-filled cistern. A door with a small window to the left leads into the middle room. The middle room has a bench along the right wall. Towards {{the back of the}} middle room, to the left, is the half cell and to the right the cell. The half-cell has a bench along the right wall and to the left, has a square window connecting it to cave 2.

5|$|Located on the {{property}} of Ambler's Texaco Gas Station, {{just north of the}} station, is a 24-foot (7.3 m) by 16 foot (4.9m) wood clad, <b>wooden</b> <b>frame</b> building that once housed a commercial icehouse. Though its exact dates of operation are unknown, it is believed the icehouse was established by a member of Jack Schore's family during the 1930s. While the icehouse was in business, there was a small pond located about 200feet (61m) east of {{the property}}. Operators cut ice from the pond and stored it in the building until sale. After the icehouse ceased operation, a date that is also unknown, the building was used as a storage shed for the gas station. The building features a double wall with sawdust stuffed in between the walls to provide insulation. The wooden roof has asphalt shingles. Ambler's Texaco Station listing on the National Register lists the icehouse building as a contributing property.|$|E
5|$|On September 24, 1928, the Day of Atonement, British police {{resorted to}} {{removing}} by force a screen used to separate {{men and women}} at prayer. Women who tried to prevent the screen being dismantled were beaten by the police, who used pieces of the broken <b>wooden</b> <b>frame</b> as clubs. Chairs were then pulled out from under elderly worshipers. The episode made international news and Jews the world over objected to the British action. Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld, the Chief Rabbi of the ultraorthodox Jews in Jerusalem, issued a protest letter {{on behalf of his}} community, the Edah HaChareidis, and Agudas Yisroel strongly condemning the desecration of the holy site. Various communal leaders called for a general strike. A large rally was held in the Etz Chaim Yeshiva, following which an angry crowd attacked the local police station in which they believed Douglas Valder Duff, the British officer involved, was sheltering.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1997, a storm blew out the main two-story window {{at the front of}} the building, and the window's <b>wooden</b> <b>frame</b> was rotten, cracked and could not be saved. The window {{remained}} unrepaired, which left the sanctuary open to the elements for a month before the congregation, down to approximately 100 members, asked for assistance. The congregants had, by then, long held services in a smaller room, using the sanctuary only on the High Holidays. The New York Landmarks Conservancy's Endangered Buildings fund gave $2,500 for a temporary metal window, and assisted in getting approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission for the work required to repair the damage, but the congregation did not have the $10,000 required to pay for it. Beth Hamedrash Hagodol received an additional $2,000 from the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Sacred Sites program in 1998 for a conditions survey. In 1999 a second application for National Historical designation was made, this time successful; the building was deemed significant at the local level, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 30.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{recorded}} that the Han Dynasty (202 BCâ€“ AD 220) court eunuch Cai Lun (50 ADâ€“ AD 121) invented the pulp papermaking process and established {{the use of}} new materials used in making paper, ancient padding and wrapping paper artifacts dating to the 2nd century BC {{have been found in}} China, the oldest example of pulp papermaking being a map from Fangmatan, Tianshui; by the 3rd century, paper as a writing medium was in widespread use, replacing traditional but more expensive writing mediums such as strips of bamboo rolled into threaded scrolls, strips of silk, wet clay tablets hardened later in a furnace, and wooden tablets. The earliest known piece of paper with writing on it was discovered in the ruins of a Chinese watchtower at Tsakhortei, Alxa League, where Han Dynasty troops had deserted their position in AD 110 following a Xiongnu attack. In the paper making process established by Cai in 105, a boiled mixture of mulberry tree bark, hemp, old linens and fish nets created a pulp that was pounded into paste and stirred with water; a <b>wooden</b> <b>frame</b> sieve with a mat of sewn reeds was then dunked into the mixture, which was then shaken and then dried into sheets of paper that were bleached under the exposure of sunlight; K.S. Tom says this process was gradually improved through leaching, polishing and glazing to produce a smooth, strong paper. Paper is used a lot.|$|E
5|$|Poorly {{developed}} handicraft {{and limited}} resources for metal working {{are characteristic of}} the communities of all early Slavic cultures. There were no major iron production centers, but metal founding techniques were known; among the metal objects occasionally found are iron knives and hooks, as well as bronze decorative items (as {{can be found in}} 7th-century finds in HaÄ‡ki, Bielsk Podlaski County, a site of one of the earliest fortified settlements). The inventories of the typical small open settlements also normally include various utensils made of stone, horn and clay (including weights used for weaving). The settlements were arranged as clusters of cabins along river or stream valleys, but above their flood levels, they were usually irregular and typically faced south. The <b>wooden</b> <b>frame</b> or pillar-supported square houses covered with a straw roof had each sides of 2.5 to 4.5 meters in length. Fertile lowlands were sought, but also forested areas with diversified plant and animal environment to provide additional sustenance. The settlements were self-sufficient; the early Slavs functioned without significant long-distance trade. Potter's wheels were used from the turn of the 7th century on. Some villages larger than a few homes have been discovered in the KrakÃ³w-Nowa Huta region from the 6th to 9th century, for example a complex of 11 settlements on the left bank of the Vistula in the direction of IgoÅ‚omia. The original furnishings of Slavic huts are difficult to determine, because equipment was often made of perishable materials such as wood, leather or fabrics. Free- standing clay dome stoves for bread baking have been found on some locations. Another large 6thâ€“ to 9th-century settlement complex existed in the vicinity of GÅ‚ogÃ³w in Silesia.|$|E
