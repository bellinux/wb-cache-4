50|$|At the hospital, Holder {{wakes up}} to find his nephew Davie (Arien Boey) {{alone in the room}} with him. He gives Davie a gold coin to replace the one he took from him in his junkie days. Holder's phone rings repeatedly, and he finally picks up. At the airport, Linden sees Jack off on a flight to Chicago to go stay with his father. She praises his inner {{strength}} and promises to see him again soon. As she looks out the airport <b>window,</b> <b>Holder</b> arrives to say Jack called him. Holder attempts to console her.|$|E
50|$|An X-ray {{spectrograph}} {{consists of}} a {{high voltage power supply}} (50 kV or 100 kV), a broad band X-ray tube, usually with a tungsten anode and a beryllium <b>window,</b> a specimen <b>holder,</b> an analyzing crystal, a goniometer, and an X-ray detector device. These are arranged as shown in Fig. 1.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design intent}} model, {{revealed}} on April 14, 2010, seated two adults, had power <b>windows,</b> cup <b>holders,</b> and had 22.75 cuft L of cargo capacity, {{enough for a}} couple of surfboards or a dozen bags of groceries. It used LED running and interior lights to reduce power consumption. An optional solar panel mounted on the roof runs the heat pump during the day. This keeps the interior comfortable and reduces the size of the heat pump needed. The seats can be heated or cooled by forced air, both for comfort and efficiency reasons. The only comfort downside is that the suspension was described as [...] "hard".|$|R
50|$|Fluorine solidifies at −220 °C (−363 °F) into a cubic structure, called beta-fluorine. This {{phase is}} {{transparent}} and soft, with significant disorder of the molecules; its density is 1.70 g/cm3. At −228 °C (−378 °F) fluorine undergoes a solid-solid phase transition into a monoclinic structure called alpha-fluorine. This phase is opaque and hard, with close-packed layers of molecules, and is denser at 1.97 g/cm3. The solid state phase change requires {{more energy than}} the melting point transition and can be violent, shattering samples and blowing out sample <b>holder</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
50|$|Holder {{was born}} in the Caldmore area, near the centre of Walsall, Staffordshire, England. As a child he moved with his family to the Beechdale Estate, a council estate in the north of the town. The son of a <b>window</b> cleaner, <b>Holder</b> passed the Eleven plus exam and {{attended}} a grammar school for a year until it closed. He then attended the new T. P. Riley Comprehensive School and passed 6 GCE O-level exams. He formed a group called the Rockin' Phantoms with school friends at the age of 13, and with money earned from a part-time job, he bought a guitar and an amplifier. He also used his father's window-cleaning van to drive Robert Plant to gigs with Plant's band at the time, the Tennessee Teens. Holder turned professional with a band called the Memphis Cutouts and then with Steve Brett & the Mavericks in the early '60s made four singles for Columbia Records.|$|R
50|$|In {{developing}} numerous innovative merchandising concepts, Leeds {{was granted}} patents from the US Patent Office {{ranging from a}} retractable pen for American Express to a suction cup <b>window</b> display <b>holder</b> for Hunter Douglas Inc. Doug Leeds {{was active in the}} industry trade association, POPAI (Point of Purchase Advertising International), serving as Vice Chair of its Board of Directors and Chair of numerous committees, including its Annual Conference and Marketplace Show at Jacob Javits Convention Center. In 2002 Doug Leeds was the youngest member ever elected to the POPAI Hall of Fame. A frequent speaker at industry conferences, Leeds has published numerous articles in trade journals such as BrandWeek and Potentials In Marketing. He also authored chapters in the best-selling college textbooks on sales promotion and merchandising: The Sales Promotion Handbook, published by Darnell and contributed to McGraw-Hill's The Customer Is Always Right! As a merchandising expert, Leeds was featured in The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and was a guest on CNBC's Money Watch and CNN's Power Lunch. Leeds also served on the corporate boards of University Home Services Inc, Auto Data Systems and C-360, Inc.|$|R
50|$|Specification options {{ranged from}} power steering, tinted glass, split rear seats, {{electric}} <b>windows</b> and cup <b>holders</b> to ABS, air conditioning, Xenon headlights and satellite navigation. Thirty-two models with seven engines {{ranging from the}} 1.4 diesel to the 1.6 L 16V GTI made the choice of Polo the widest ever seen. The base model was the Comfortline with the option of no less than 5 engines ranging from the 1.0 50 PS (37 kW) to the 1.9 TDI unit found across the VW range, producing 90 PS (66 kW). The 1.0 L hatchback was considered cheap for the build quality and spec list {{when compared to other}} cars. Then came the Trendline and Highline models. With engine options ranging from 60 PS (44 kW) to a 110 PS (81 kW) diesel they offered a range of features usually found on the more sporty models but without the insurance or running cost woes.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} measure the dual {{tunability}} with the pore-filling and the tilting, a closed chamber with dedicated inlet and outlet orifices for vapor or liquid, an anti-reflection glass <b>window,</b> and a <b>holder</b> for the porous Si photonic crystal was constructed. Ethanol vapor was pumped into the closed chamber by a self-designed circulating system through the inlet orifice and left through the outlet orifice. The spectrometer detector fiber was synchronized to the rotation {{in such a way}} that this detector fiber was always aligned to the light reflected from the crystal. In order to characterize the dual tunability, the spectrum of the photonic crystal was measured for each tilting angle for two states. First, the spectrum of the photonic crystal in the empty chamber (pores filled with air) was recorded. Afterwards, the chamber was filled with vapor, which resulted in capillary condensation of vapor in the pores of the photonic crystal. Then the spectrum was recorded again.|$|R

40|$|The Mars Science Laboratory {{mission was}} {{launched}} from Cape Canaveral, Florida on Nov. 26, 2011 {{and landed in}} Gale crater, Mars on Aug. 6, 2012. MSL's mission is to identify and characterize ancient "habitable" environments on Mars. MSL's precision landing system placed the Curiosity rover within 2 km {{of the center of}} its 20 X 6 km landing ellipse, next to Gale's central mound, a 5, 000 meter high pile of laminated sediment which may contain 1 billion years of Mars history. Curiosity carries with it a full suite of analytical instruments, including the CheMin X-ray diffractometer, the first XRD flown in space. CheMin is essentially a transmission X-ray pinhole camera. A fine-focus Co source and collimator transmits a 50 m beam through a powdered sample held between X-ray transparent plastic <b>windows.</b> The sample <b>holder</b> is shaken by a piezoelectric actuator such that the powder flows like a liquid, each grain passing in random orientation through the beam over time. Forward-diffracted and fluoresced X-ray photons from the sample are detected by an X-ray sensitive Charge Coupled Device (CCD) operated in single photon counting mode. When operated in this way, both the x,y position and the energy of each photon are detected. The resulting energy-selected Co Kalpha Debye-Scherrer pattern is used to determine the identities and amounts of minerals present via Rietveld refinement, and a histogram of all X-ray events constitutes an X-ray fluorescence analysis of the sample. The key role that definitive mineralogy plays in understanding the Martian surface is a consequence of the fact that minerals are thermodynamic phases, having known and specific ranges of temperature, pressure and composition within which they are stable. More than simple compositional analysis, definitive mineralogical analysis can provide information about pressure/temperature conditions of formation, past climate, water activity and the like. Definitive mineralogical analyses are necessary to establish the origin or provenance of a sample. The search for evidence of extant or extinct life on Mars will initially be a search for evidence of present or past conditions supportive of life (e. g., evidence of water), not for life itself. Results of the first 1, 000 sols (Mars days) will be discussed, including the discovery of the first habitable environment on Mars...|$|R
