40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{presenting}} {{the results and}} processes of designing a scaled down crane model that is intended for studying of crane behavior and control systems. The design process is performed as an iteration process with a system design approach. The objective {{is to develop a}} crane that will provide a solid basis for future research and testing. One of the most central parts of the work done and presented in this thesis is the de- velopment of a simulation model that is able to predict the behavior of several different configurations of the scaled down crane model. The usefulness of the simulation model during the design process of the crane is well documented throughout this thesis. Tests comparing the simulation model and the real crane is performed and documented, and the accuracy of the simulation model is demonstrated. The results found in the comparison is that the behavior predicted by the simulation model is more or less identical to the behavior of the real crane. This concludes that the methods and models used to create the simulation model presented in this thesis can be considered verry effective. The design of the crane is not only based on the results form the dynamic simulations. The structure have been analyzed with the use of final element analysis {{to make sure that the}} structure is in accordance with the design requirements. It has also been done several conceptual evaluations of the crane design regarding modularity and future expansion and modifications. This is done to making the crane a solid basis for further development and modification. A control system is developed and tested in both the simulation model and in the crane lab. The control systems is fairly basic and only consisting of controllers that control the speed of the motors powering the crane and the initiation of the <b>winch</b> <b>brake.</b> Even though the controllers are basic and only controlling one separate motor each the level of accuracy that is possible to achieve with this type of control has proven to be impressive. The controllers will therefore provide a good basis for further development of more sophisticated control of the crane...|$|E
40|$|The <b>brake</b> of <b>winch</b> is {{to prevent}} the {{occurrence}} of reverse slipping at working time. Based on the analysis of two types of brake, this article establishes the relationship model of the brake force and the angle of the screw thread on the brake shaft and builds the model of the relationship of the brake force and the height of the cone and found that the brake force is the largest when the angle of the screw is 45 °. Also found that the brake force increases with the increase in the load, and the brake force is positively related to the height of the cone. Two brake mechanisms are manufactured and arranged in the same winch to conduct the experimental performance comparison. The experimental results show that the temperature of the <b>winch</b> with cone <b>brake</b> finally reaches about 60 °C, which is 33 % lower than the 90 °C of the disk brake, and the no-load current of the cone <b>brake</b> <b>winch</b> is under 60 [*]A, while in the disk <b>brake</b> <b>winch</b> it is over 90 [*]A after 7 [*]min, which consumes 33 % energy than cone brake. The cone brake can reduce the occurrence of harmful friction and enhance the efficiency of winch and is able to solve the winch safety problem caused by nylon cable damage because of the heat accumulation...|$|R

40|$|When {{developing}} a simulator for cutter suction dredges, the different processes {{have to be}} considered non-stationary and dynamical. A simulator usually consists of a combination of input by a user and hard- and software processing this input and generating output. In the case of a cutter suction dredge simulator the manual control of the swing winches, by means of joysticks, is one of the important inputs for the simulation process. The position of the joysticks determines a set point for either the swing velocity or the revolutions of the hauling swing winch. By means of a control algorithm the hauling winch will generate a hauling torque, while the <b>braking</b> <b>winch</b> exerts a <b>brake</b> torque. This results in pulling forces in both the swing wires. These forces, combined with the cutting forces and the current forces, result in a rotation around the active spud. This rotation can be described with the equilibrium equation of the dredge around the active spud...|$|R
50|$|The runway {{was painted}} with a {{contoured}} outline of Graf Zeppelins flight deck and simulated deck landings were then conducted over an arresting cable strung width-wise across the airstrip. The cable {{was attached to}} an electromechanical braking device manufactured by DEMAG (Deutsche Maschinenfabrik A.G. Duisburg). Testing began in March 1938 using the Heinkel He 50, Arado Ar 195 and Ar 197. Later, a stronger <b>braking</b> <b>winch</b> was supplied by Atlas-Werke of Bremen and this allowed heavier aircraft, such as the Fieseler Fi 167 and Junkers Ju 87, to be tested. After some initial problems, Luftwaffe pilots performed 1,500 successful braked landings out of 1,800 attempted.|$|R
40|$|Ports {{exposed to}} high energy long wave {{conditions}} can experience significantly reduced berth operability. Geraldton is {{perhaps one of}} the best known examples. Recent studies to mitigate the problems have concentrated on the reduction of the long waves by extending the breakwater. However, this is quite costly. Various countermeasures related to the mooring configuration are defined and analysed in this paper. The analysed alternatives are use of shore-based mooring lines, installation of softer fenders, a combination of these two, and deployment of Cavotec MoorMaster™ units. These alternatives were compared with the existing mooring configuration and with the option to extend the breakwater. The best improvement (50 % increase of threshold long wave height inside the harbour) is reached by installing a combination of pneumatic fenders and constant tension winches set to 30 t, or nylon breast lines on a <b>brake</b> <b>winch</b> with a pretension of 25 t. In this way, the vessel is pulled into the fenders and fender friction prevents excessive surging of the ship along the berth...|$|R
50|$|The {{thousand}} foot lift of {{the cable}} railway was not continuous. The initial two and later three sections of the Ashley Planes railroad was capable of operation as a funicular railroad or a cable railroad, for its hoist houses all used a pusher cart called a 'barney' hooked into a continuous cable {{in the same way}} as a modern ski lift uses a continuous cable. Like a ski lift, the railway was operated from a standing engine by an operator in control of a <b>winch,</b> clutch and <b>brake.</b> A helper spotted cars below a short local drop to an area upslope of the 'barney house', where the cable and pusher cart would drop into on one end (heading down) and rise out of on the other to engage the freight cars and push them upwards. The axle on the barney's telescoped so that at the barney house entrance the barney's wheels slide inside and dropped under the plane of the standard width railroad tracks so the barney could slide away and let gravity take the consist onto the marshaling yard. When using furnicular action, as it did sending returns down during its early years the rails split connecting two pairs of tracks bulging out in a vase-like shape in a passing area, so the railway could ship freight downhill east to west as well as the heavy operations west to east which predominated until its closing. In the earliest years of operation, there was no back track to return cars to the bottom for refilling, and they had to be returned on the Planes, thus slowing and complicating the lift operations. When stopping cars from rolling free, the barneys had to be positioned below the cars, and since the upsides are uphills from the barney house opening, that meant a latch (brake system) had to hold a string of empties above the barney before it emerged from hiding its little tunnel. It also means the barney was moving down hill and away from the latched cars which would then accelerate and bang into the small barneys with considerable force, part of which was transmitted via the cables to everything in the system. It was actually easier to lift cars waiting at a latch for a barney than it was to drop cars down safely onto a moving barney.In the 1860s, the LH&S completed tracks along the right bank of the Lehigh through the Lehigh Gorge to Mauch Chunk (now Jim Thorpe, PA) and its trackage to the Delaware Valley, especially the Delaware Canal to Philadelphia markets and rail connections at Easton via the industrial centers of Allentown and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. These inclined plane railbeds were used for the transportation of anthracite coal. The railroads were in use until 1948.|$|R
