5|$|In 87, Vestal Virgins <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> broken their sacred vows {{of lifelong}} public chastity. As the Vestals were {{regarded}} as daughters of the community, this offense essentially constituted incest. Accordingly, those found guilty of any such transgression were condemned to death, either by a manner of their choosing, or according to the ancient fashion, which dictated that Vestals should be buried alive.|$|E
5|$|Indigenous land {{owners have}} {{consistently}} opposed uranium mining and have spoken {{out about the}} adverse impact it has on their communities. The British nuclear tests at Maralinga <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> left significant radiation hazards in land given back to the Maralinga Tjarutja people, and the issue continues to cause indigenous opposition.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, cheetahs {{are poor}} breeders in captivity, while wild {{individuals}} {{are far more}} successful. In a 1992 study, females in Serengeti <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> 95% success rate in breeding. In contrast, only 20% of the North American captive cheetahs bred successfully in 1991. Studies have shown that in-vitro fertilisation in cheetah poses more difficulties than are faced {{in the case of}} other cats.|$|E

5|$|Upon release, {{some of the}} Limited Edition {{versions}} of Halo 3 <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a defect in the hub that kept the discs in place, {{which could lead to}} scratched discs.

This was not a problem in either the Legendary Edition or the Standard Edition.|$|E

5|$|After the {{dissolution}} of the Kingdom of Madagascar, the French colonial authorities shifted the location of these tombs thereby disrupting the original cosmological symbolism of their arrangement. When the original tombs were excavated for relocation, the French found the mortal remains of the nobles within had each been wrapped in numerous traditional lambas (woven silk cloths) then set within wooden coffins packed with charcoal. Bodies buried at Ambohimanga <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been entombed in the same way.|$|E
5|$|During press {{conferences}} on 13 and 14 December, DCS Gull revealed that police believed the locations where the five bodies <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been 'deposition sites', not murder scenes, {{indicating that the}} victims were all killed elsewhere and transported to the locations where they were later found; no comment was made on where the women may have been murdered. DCS Gull also revealed that some items of women's clothing and accessories, including a handbag and jacket, had been recovered and were being forensically tested to establish whether they belonged {{to any of the}} murdered women.|$|E
5|$|Early {{aircraft}} {{suffered from}} leaks in wing fuel tanks that required re-sealing after each flight and 85 aircraft <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> cracks in outer wing ribs and stringers. There were also problems with aileron control cylinders, electrical connectors, and engine compartment fires. Reconnaissance RF-4Cs made their debut in Vietnam on 30 October 1965, flying the hazardous post-strike reconnaissance missions. The USAF Thunderbirds used the F-4E from the 1969 season until 1974.|$|E
40|$|In {{a patient}} with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, the plasma <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a {{potassium}} level of 10 · 4 mEq. / 1.

50|$|In a 2001 {{survey of}} stress {{fractures}} in theropods, one toe bone from indeterminate ornithomimids out of fifteen examined <b>was</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a stress fracture.

A radio transmitter hidden in the garden was not retrieved until 1977.|$|E
5|$|In nature, sixteen {{repositories}} {{were discovered}} at the Oklo mine in Gabon where natural nuclear fission reactions took place 1.7 billion years ago. The fission products in these natural formations <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> moved less than 10ft (3 m) over this period, though {{the lack of}} movement may be due more to retention in the uraninite structure than to insolubility and sorption from moving ground water; uraninite crystals are better preserved here than those in spent fuel rods because of a less complete nuclear reaction, so that reaction products would be less accessible to groundwater attack.|$|E
5|$|Lexical {{variation}} between BASL {{and other}} dialects of ASL was first {{noted in the}} Dictionary of American Sign Language. In a later study of 34 lexical signs, Black signers <b>were</b> <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> 28 signs that White signers did not know. Older signers {{are more likely to}} use variant signs than younger signers. Most of these signs, having been developed in segregated schools for the Black Deaf, refer to everyday life. Younger signers of BASL are less likely to use these variants, but when asked about them are aware that older signers have and use these innovative signs.|$|E
