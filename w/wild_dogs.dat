5|$|Spotted hyenas {{will follow}} packs of African <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> {{in order to}} {{appropriate}} their kills. They will typically inspect areas where <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> have rested and eat any food remains they find. When approaching <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> at a kill, solitary hyenas will approach cautiously and attempt to take off {{with a piece of}} meat unnoticed, though they may be mobbed by the dogs in the attempt. When operating in groups, spotted hyenas are more successful in pirating dog kills, though the dog's greater tendency to assist each other puts them at an advantage against spotted hyenas, who rarely work in unison. Cases of dogs scavenging from spotted hyenas are rare. Although wild dog packs can easily repel solitary hyenas, on the whole, {{the relationship between the two}} species is a one sided benefit for the hyenas, with wild dog densities being negatively correlated with high hyena populations.|$|E
5|$|Lions tend to {{dominate}} smaller felids such as African cheetahs and leopards where they co-occur, stealing their kills and killing their cubs and even adults when given the chance. The cheetah {{in particular has}} a 50% chance of losing its kill to lions or other predators. Lions are major killers of cheetah cubs, accounting for up to 78.2% of predator-killed juveniles in one study. Cheetahs avoid their competitors using different temporal (time) and spatial (habitat) niches. Leopards are able to take refuge in trees; however, lionesses will occasionally be successful in climbing to retrieve leopard kills. Similarly, lions dominate African <b>wild</b> <b>dogs,</b> not only taking their kills but also preying on young and (rarely) adult dogs. Population densities of <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> are low in areas where lions are more abundant. However, {{there are a few}} reported cases of old and wounded lions falling prey to <b>wild</b> <b>dogs.</b> African lions may also conflict with Nile crocodiles. Depending {{on the size of the}} crocodile and the lion, either can lose kills or carrion to the other. Lions have been known to kill crocodiles venturing onto land, while the reverse is true for lions entering waterways, as evidenced by the occasional lion claw found in crocodile stomachs.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} little {{opportunity}} to study epidemiology in the Sumatran rhinoceros. Ticks and gyrostigma were reported to cause deaths in captive animals in the 19th century. The rhino is also known to be vulnerable to the blood disease surra, which can be spread by horse-flies carrying parasitic trypanosomes; in 2004, all five rhinos at the Sumatran Rhinoceros Conservation Centre died over an 18-day period after becoming infected by the disease. The Sumatran rhino has no known predators other than humans. Tigers and <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> may be capable of killing a calf, but calves stay close to their mothers, {{and the frequency of}} such killings is unknown. Although the rhino's range overlaps with elephants and tapirs, the species do not appear to compete for food or habitat. Elephants (Elephas maximus) and Sumatran rhinos are even known to share trails, and many smaller species such as deer, boars, and <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> will use the trails the rhinos and elephants create.|$|E
5|$|Bohor reedbuck {{are active}} {{throughout}} the day, seeking cover during the daytime and grazing in the night. A {{large proportion of}} the whole day is spent on feeding and vigilance. They can easily camouflage in grasses and reeds, and hide themselves rather than running from danger. When threatened, they usually remain motionless or retreat slowly into cover for defense, but if the threat is close, they flee, whistling shrilly to alert the others. It hides from predators rather than forming herds in defense. Many predators, including lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, African <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> and Nile crocodiles, prey on the reedbuck.|$|E
5|$|The natural poison fluoroacetate (Compound 1080) is {{commonly}} used in Australia to control introduced pests such as European rabbits, foxes, feral predators, and <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> such as dingoes. The poison is extremely toxic to introduced pests, but less so to native animals as it is found naturally in many Australian plants. However, juvenile quolls may be susceptible to the poison. Research is underway {{to determine whether the}} number of quolls protected from predators may be less than those killed by the poison.|$|E
40|$|The small {{population}} size of <b>wild</b> <b>dog</b> Lycaon pictus (10) in Hluhluwe-Umfolozi Park (HUP) {{and the decline}} in their numbers since 1992, has caused concern for their survival and consideration of further introductions. In the light of many failed <b>wild</b> <b>dog</b> relocation and reintroduction programmes, this study contributes towards {{an understanding of the}} ecology of the HUP <b>wild</b> <b>dog</b> pack. <b>Wild</b> <b>dog</b> prey preference was determined from scat analysis and personal observations, and their potential impact on the primary prey species was modelled. The choice of physical habitat features by <b>wild</b> <b>dog</b> and their ranging behaviour within the Park were correlated with the distribution of their primary prey and other predators. To determine the susceptibility of prey to predation in three reserves with different predator diversities and densities, prey vigilance and prey response to playback recordings of predator calls were recorded. The results showed that <b>wild</b> <b>dog</b> preference for females, adult nyala Tragelaphus angasi and juvenile impala Aepyceros melampus, was a function of prey abundance...|$|R

5|$|Common elands {{communicate}} via gestures, vocalizations, scent cues {{and display}} behaviors. The flehmen response also occurs, primarily in males {{in response to}} contact with female urine or genitals. Females will urinate to indicate fertility during the appropriate phase of their estrous cycle, {{as well as to}} indicate their lack of fertility when harassed by males. If eland bulls find any of their predators nearby, they will bark and attempt {{to attract the attention of}} others by trotting back and forth until the entire herd is conscious of the danger. Some of their main predators include lions, African <b>wild</b> <b>dogs,</b> cheetahs and spotted hyenas. Juvenile elands are more vulnerable than adults to their predators.|$|E
5|$|Premastication and mouth-to-mouth feeding {{in humans}} is {{postulated}} to have {{evolved from the}} regurgitation of food from parent to offspring or male to female (courtship feeding) and has been observed in numerous mammals and animals of other species. For instance, food begging behaviour observed in young wolves, <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> and certain gulls species, which involves the young approaching the beak or mouth of the adult with their own whereupon gaping their mouths or nuzzling, the adult would regurgitate portions of food to feed the young. However, in the aforementioned animals, this nuzzling behaviour {{and other types of}} mouth-to-mouth contact are also used for bonding, socialization, and courtship.|$|E
5|$|The Range Wide Conservation Program for Cheetah and African <b>Wild</b> <b>Dogs</b> (RWCP), {{the brainchild}} of Sarah Durant and Rosie Woodroffe (of the Zoological Society of London), was started in 2007 with the primary aim of {{ensuring}} better conservation measures for the cheetah and the wild dogtwo species with very low population densities. A joint initiative by the ZSL, the Wildlife Conservation Society, and the IUCN Cat Specialist Group, the program has among its major goals {{a review of the}} conservation policies adopted by the South African countries, and study and action on illegal hunting and trade of the cheetah. In a 2007 publication, Durant emphasised the role of land management and improvement in connectivity across the range in cheetah conservation, in the lack of which the populations might face severe fragmentation.|$|E

5|$|The addax mainly eats {{grasses and}} leaves of any {{available}} shrubs, leguminous herbs and bushes. These animals are well-adapted {{to exist in}} their desert habitat, as they can live without water {{for long periods of}} time. Addax form herds of five to 20 members, consisting of both males and females. They are led by the oldest female. Due to its slow movements, the antelope is an easy target for its predators: lions, humans, African <b>wild</b> <b>dogs,</b> cheetahs, and leopards. Breeding season is at its peak during winter and early spring. The natural habitat of the addax are arid regions, semideserts and sandy and stony deserts.|$|E
5|$|Giraffes {{have high}} adult {{survival}} probability, and an unusually long lifespan {{compared to other}} ruminants, up to 25 years in the wild. Because of their size, eyesight and powerful kicks, adult giraffes are usually not subject to predation, aside from lions. Giraffes {{are the most common}} prey for the big cats in Kruger National Park. Nile crocodiles can also be a threat to giraffes when they bend down to drink. Calves are much more vulnerable than adults, and are additionally preyed on by leopards, spotted hyenas and <b>wild</b> <b>dogs.</b> A quarter to a half of giraffe calves reach adulthood. Calf survival varies according to the season of birth, with calves born during the dry season having higher survival rates. The local, seasonal presence of large herds of migratory wildebeests and zebras reduces predation pressure on giraffe calves and increases their survival probability.|$|E
5|$|The cheetah, {{especially}} {{mothers with}} young cubs, are highly vigilant; {{they need to}} remain on a lookout for large carnivores who might steal the prey or harm the cubs, and for any potential prey. In Africa, the cheetah will surrender its kill to sturdier carnivores such as lions, leopards, spotted and brown hyenas, and <b>wild</b> <b>dogs.</b> Cheetahs lose around 10 to 15% of their kills to other predators; the percentage {{was found to be}} as high as 50% in a 1986 study. Cheetahs have rarely been observed to feed on the kills of other carnivores; {{this may be due to}} vultures and spotted hyena adroitly capturing and consuming heavy carcasses within a short time. In Eurasia, in the past, the cheetah's range overlapped not just with those of the lion, leopard and hyena, but also other carnivores, such as the tiger, wolf and bear.|$|E

40|$|<b>Wild</b> <b>Dog</b> {{policy in}} New South Wales is controversial.

Through an analysis of the types of discretion that National Parks rangers use in their implementation of <b>Wild</b> <b>Dog</b> Policy, this thesis will analyse the way in which discretion {{can be used as a}} means of resolving conflict in controversial policy areas. An initial understanding of the background to the complex issue of <b>wild</b> <b>dog</b> management, and the legislation and policies surrounding <b>wild</b> <b>dog</b> control provides substance to theories of discretion. These theories have been applied to the interview data of nine National Parks rangers, and an analysis of their experiences in implementing the controversial policy issue. Fundamentally this thesis finds that the different 'types' of discretion allow rangers to resolve conflict and implement a difficult policy area effectively...|$|R

5|$|Elephants {{typically}} coexist peacefully {{with other}} herbivores, which will usually {{stay out of}} their way. Some aggressive interactions between elephants and rhinoceros have been recorded. At Aberdare National Park, Kenya, a rhino attacked an elephant calf and was killed by the other elephants in the group. At Hluhluwe‚ÄìUmfolozi Game Reserve, South Africa, introduced young orphan elephants went on a killing spree that {{claimed the lives of}} 36 rhinos during the 1990s, but ended with the introduction of older males. The size of adult elephants makes them nearly invulnerable to predators, though there are rare reports of adult elephants falling prey to tigers. Calves may be preyed on by lions, spotted hyenas, and <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> in Africa and tigers in Asia. The lions of Savuti, Botswana, have adapted to hunting juvenile elephants during the dry season, and a pride of 30 lions has been recorded killing juvenile individuals between the ages of four and eleven years. Elephants appear to distinguish between the growls of larger predators like tigers and smaller ones like leopards (which have not been recorded killing calves); the latter they react less fearfully and more aggressively to. Elephants tend to have high numbers of parasites, particularly nematodes, compared to other herbivores. This is due to lower predation pressures that would otherwise kill off many of the individuals with significant parasite loads.|$|E
5|$|The blue {{wildebeest}} is preyed on by lions, leopards, African <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> and hyenas and predation is {{the main}} cause of death. They are also prone to outbreaks of disease which may also lead to a decline in numbers. Major human-related factors affecting populations include large-scale deforestation, the drying up of water sources, the expansion of settlements and poaching. Diseases of domestic cattle such as sleeping sickness can be transmitted to the animals and take their toll. The erection of fences that interrupt traditional migratory routes between wet and dry-season ranges have resulted in mass death events when the animals become cut off from water sources and the areas of better grazing they are seeking during droughts. A study of the factors influencing wildebeest populations in the Maasai Mara ecosystem revealed that the populations had undergone a drastic decline of around 80% from about 119,000 individuals in 1977 to around 22,000 twenty years later. The major cause of this was thought to be the expansion of agriculture, which led to the loss of wet season grazing and the traditional calving and breeding ranges. Similarly, drastic declines have recently occurred in the Tarangire wildebeest migration.|$|E

5|$|Spotted hyenas have {{a complex}} set of postures in communication. When afraid, the ears are folded flat, and are often {{combined}} with baring of the teeth and a flattening of the mane. When attacked by other hyenas or by <b>wild</b> <b>dogs,</b> the hyena lowers its hindquarters. Before and during an assertive attack, the head is held high with the ears cocked, mouth closed, mane erect and the hindquarters high. The tail usually hangs down when neutral, though it will change position according to the situation. When a high tendency to flee an attacker is apparent, the tail is curled below the belly. During an attack, or when excited, the tail is carried forward on the back. An erect tail does not always accompany a hostile encounter, as it has also been observed to occur when a harmless social interaction occurs. Although they do not wag their tails, spotted hyenas will flick their tails when approaching dominant animals or when there is a slight tendency to flee. When approaching a dominant animal, subordinate spotted hyenas will walk on the knees of their forelegs in submission. Greeting ceremonies among clan-members consist of two individuals standing parallel to each other and facing opposite directions. Both individuals raise their hind legs and lick each other's anogenital area. During these greeting ceremonies, the penis or pseudo-penis often becomes erect, in both males and females. Erection is usually a sign of submission, rather than dominance, and is more common in males than in females.|$|E
25|$|According to {{a five-year}} study of 2000 <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> from all states of Australia by Ricky Spencer from the University of Western Sydney some populations consist to 80% of dingo-hybrids and this {{enrichment}} of genes {{has provided a}} catalyst for the selection and micro-evolution of bigger <b>wild</b> <b>dogs.</b> Over {{the course of the}} last 40 years there was an increase of the average wild dog body mass of about 20%, with 40% of the adult <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> in the Southeast of the continent now weighing more than 17kg. This larger dog size has led to a higher efficiency with which <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> kill major prey and models indicate that a pack of <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> today requires almost a quarter more daily energy intake than an average pack of <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> prior to 1980. Furthermore, due to the high number of kangaroos and livestock, the <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> have been given the necessary environment to reach larger sizes.|$|E
25|$|However, these hybrids don‚Äôt {{necessarily}} have to be of low dingo-content. During an analysis of 56 <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> in Southeast-Queensland {{the researchers found that}} these dogs had a dingo-content of more than 50% or were ‚Äúpure‚Äù dingoes. ‚ÄúPure‚Äù feral dogs of other origin or hybrids with low dingo-content could not be found. Therefore, it was reasoned that the <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> of Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast are the descendents of dingoes, instead of escaped or rejected dogs. During studies on <b>wild</b> <b>dogs</b> of the Kosciuszko national park, many hybrids were found but these dogs were of relatively high dingo-content.|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{examined}} the behavioural, temporal and spatial effects of simulated African <b>wild</b> <b>dog</b> (Lycaon pictus) presence on its two main prey species: kudu (Tragelaphus strepsiceros) and impala (Aepyceros melampus). We spread African <b>wild</b> <b>dog</b> faeces around waterholes and played African <b>wild</b> <b>dog</b> sounds at different intervals to mimic immediate and non-immediate predation pressure. We looked at anti-predator behaviour at both a herd and individual level and distinguished between high-quality (detracts from all other activities), high-cost vigilance and low-quality (used to monitor the surrounding in spare time), low-cost vigilance to determine costs involved. We found that simulated African <b>wild</b> <b>dog</b> presence {{had little effect on}} anti-predator behaviour of their free-ranging prey. Only when immediate predation risk was mimicked did kudu invest in (additional) high-quality vigilance, whereas impala showed no response. Regardless of direct cues of African <b>wild</b> <b>dog</b> presence, behavioural adjustments to reduce predation risk were primarily based on environmental factors such as time of the day and broad-scale habitat structure. Predators have been shown to utilize waterholes to hunt, and prey species are therefore likely to maximize anti-predator behaviour in this high-risk environment based on environmental variables affecting predation risk, the main predator within the system, and water requirements, leaving little flexibility to respond to (simulated) African <b>wild</b> <b>dog</b> presence...|$|R
