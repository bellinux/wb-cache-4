500|$|In July 1968, the Beatles moved Apple Corps, their {{multimedia}} corporation, into 3 Savile Row. A {{studio was}} built in the basement; though it was poorly designed, the Beatles recorded Let It Be there before a new studio was constructed in 1971 at an estimated cost of $1.5 million. Various artists, including Badfinger, Mary Hopkin, and Marc Bolan recorded in the basement studio until it closed in May 1975. The Beatles' final live performance, known as the [...] "rooftop concert", was held {{on the roof of the}} building, on 30 January 1969, and was recorded for the documentary film Let It Be; the last words of the band, spoken by John Lennon as the police stopped the performance, were [...] "I hope <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> audition." ...|$|E

[...] The album version of the song also ends with him famously quipping [...] "I'd like to say thank you on behalf of the group and ourselves, and I hope <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> audition". (Originally he said {{that at the end of}} the rooftop concert, but Phil Spector edited it into the [...] "Get Back" [...] song on the Let It Be album.) ...|$|E

5000|$|An {{example of}} a {{component}} that <b>passes</b> all <b>the</b> tests is a car's occupant restraint system. While we do not normally think of the primary occupant restraint system, it is gravity. If the vehicle rolls over or undergoes severe g-forces, then this primary method of occupant restraint may fail. Restraining the occupants during such an accident is absolutely critical to safety, so <b>we</b> <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> first test. Accidents causing occupant ejection were quite common before seat belts, so <b>we</b> <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> second test. The cost of a redundant restraint method like seat belts is quite low, both economically {{and in terms of}} weight and space, so <b>we</b> <b>pass</b> <b>the</b> third test. Therefore, adding seat belts to all vehicles is an excellent idea. Other [...] "supplemental restraint systems", such as airbags, are more expensive and so pass that test by a smaller margin.|$|R

2500|$|After {{their return}} to Australia, the members began rehearsing in February 1975, still using the name of Mississippi. In Wheatley's autobiography, Paper Paradise (1999), he {{described}} how they obtained their name: [...] "It was now {{time to get out}} of the rehearsal room and play to a live audience – somewhere without any fanfare, somewhere out of the way. I booked the Golfview Hotel in Geelong for the Saturday night of 1 March 1975. While travelling to the venue down the Geelong Road from Melbourne, <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> turn-off for Little River. From the back of the truck, Glenn Shorrock shouted, 'What about the Little River Band'? And so, that night the Golfview Hotel witnessed the first performance of the Little River Band, albeit advertised on the marquee as Mississippi." [...] On 20 March 1975 they played their first official gig under their new name at Martini's Hotel in Carlton. They played a return gig at the Golfview Hotel five days later.|$|E

[...] As a congressman, Portman traveled to Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica, the Czech Republic, Egypt, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait and Mexico. During {{his time in the}} House, Portman began assisting prominent Republican candidates prepare for debates by standing in for their opponents in practice debates. He has taken on the role of Lamar Alexander (for Bob Dole in 1996), Al Gore (for George W. Bush in 2000), Hillary Clinton (for Rick Lazio in 2000), Joe Lieberman (for Dick Cheney in 2000), John Edwards (for Cheney in 2004), and Barack Obama (for John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012). His portrayals mimic not only the person's point of view but also their mannerisms, noting for instance that he listened to Obama's audiobook reading to study his pattern of speech.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the final}} {{portion of the}} film, the Beatles and Preston are shown giving an unannounced concert from the studio rooftop. They perform [...] "Get Back," [...] "Don't Let Me Down," [...] "I've Got a Feeling," [...] "One After 909," [...] and [...] "Dig a Pony," [...] intercut with {{reactions}} and comments from surprised Londoners gathering on the streets below. The police eventually {{make their way to}} the roof and try to bring the show to a close, as the show was disrupting businesses' lunch hour nearby. This prompts some ad-libbed lyrical asides from McCartney: during the second performance of 'Get Back,' he sings, [...] "Get back, Loretta... you've been out too long, Loretta... you've been playing on the roofs again... and your mummy doesn't like that... it makes her angry... she's gonna have you arrested! Get back, Loretta!". In response to the applause from the people on the rooftop after the final song, McCartney says, [...] "Thanks Mo!" [...] (to Ringo's wife Maureen) and Lennon quips, [...] "I'd like to say 'thank you' on behalf of the group and ourselves, and I hope <b>we</b> <b>passed</b> <b>the</b> audition!" ...|$|E
