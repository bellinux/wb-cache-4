500|$|On April Fools' Day on , Sunsoft {{announced}} that a sequel to the game would be released on the Virtual Console titled Blaster Master: Destination Fred. According to their press release, the game was only purported to be tested on several PlayChoice-10 machines in the Los Angeles area between 1988 and 1989. Upon discovery of copies {{of the game in}} Sunsoft's headquarters in Japan, Gaijinworks' founder Victor Ireland said: [...] "I was blown away when I saw these. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> through boxes of stored code, promotional items, and ROMs to see what we had on hand to release for the U.S. Virtual Console market, finding these nine completely unknown cartridges literally stunned me. I knew it had to be put up on the Virtual Console as fast as we could make it happen." ...|$|E
500|$|Ruck had {{previously}} auditioned for the Bender role in The Breakfast Club which went to Judd Nelson, but Hughes remembered Ruck and cast {{him as the}} 17-year-old Cameron Frye. According to Hughes, the character of Cameron was largely based on {{a friend of his}} in high school. [...] "He was sort of a lost person. His family neglected him, so he took that as license to really pamper himself. When he was legitimately sick, he actually felt good, because it was difficult and tiring to have to invent diseases but when he actually had something, he was relaxed." [...] Ruck said the role of Cameron had originally been offered to Emilio Estevez who turned it down. [...] "Every time I see Emilio, I want to kiss him", said Ruck. [...] "Thank you!" [...] Ruck, then 29, worried about the age difference. [...] "I was worried that I'd be 10 years out of step, and I wouldn't know anything about what was cool, what was hip, all that junk. But <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to high school, I didn't know any of that stuff then, either. So I just thought, well, hell—I'll just be me. The character, he's such a loner that he really wouldn't give a damn about that stuff anyway. He'd feel guilty that he didn't know it, but that's it." [...] Ruck was not surprised to find himself cast young. [...] "No, because, really, when I was 18, I sort of looked 12", he said. [...] "Maybe it's a genetic imbalance." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2011, {{less than}} six months after giving birth to twins, Carey tweeted a picture of herself and Jermaine Dupri in a {{recording}} studio working on new material for her currently untitled upcoming fourteenth studio album, with the picture's caption reading [...] "So happy {{to be back in the}} studio with the one & only @Mr_Dupri aka Jermash! We are back together." [...] Following more speculation of the singer's return to the studio, Carey posted photos of herself and Rick Ross in Miami during late April, where the song was produced. Later revealed as the lead single from the singer's upcoming, yet-untitled fourteenth studio album, [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] was written and produced by Carey, Dupri and Bryan-Michael Cox, with Ross and Meek Mill providing their verses. Relaying several hints regarding the song to the media, Carey explained the song's conception in a series of tweets on July 30, 2012: [...] "I wrote Triumphant <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> through a difficult time and it helped me get through it. When u hear it, pay attention to the lyrics." [...] In an interview with MTV, Cox explained what fans would be able to expect from the song and why he felt Ross and Mill were [...] "the perfect fit." [...] He expressed how the [...] "inspirational song" [...] is close to Carey's heart and thought fans would become [...] "emotionally attached" [...] to it. Cox also added that Carey had committed herself to working on the album before she knew she was pregnant, but decided to halt its production until after she had given birth. With regard to the inclusion of the hip-hop duo, he explained how they became involved with the project: ...|$|E

[...] He said it took him [...] "six weeks getting all the right clever rhymes and all." ...|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked about}} the biggest {{influence}} on him in comedy, Chappelle spoke highly praise to Richard Pryor, [...] "What a precedent he set. Not just as a comic, but as a dude. The fact that someone was able to open themselves wide-open like that. It's so hard to talk {{in front of people}} or to open yourself up to your closest friends. But to open yourself up for everybody: I freebase, I beat my women, I shot my car. And nobody's mad at Richard for that. They understand. Somehow they just understand. And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> through this thing this year, that is the example I would think to myself that gave me the courage to just go back on the stage." ...|$|E

2500|$|During {{his time}} in the Texas Legislature, DeLay {{struggled}} with alcoholism and gained a reputation as a playboy, earning the nickname [...] "Hot Tub Tom". By the time of his election to Congress in 1984 he was drinking [...] "eight, ten, twelve martinis a night at receptions and fundraisers." [...] In 1985 DeLay became a born-again Christian, and gave up hard liquor. Of the Rev. Ken Wilde, an evangelical minister from Idaho who founded the National Prayer Center in Washington, D.C., which houses volunteers who come to the capital to pray for the nation's leaders, DeLay said, [...] "This is the man who really saved me. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> through my troubles, it was Ken who really stepped up." [...] Of his conversion, DeLay said, [...] "I had put my needs first ... I was on the throne, not God. I had pushed God from His throne." ...|$|E
2500|$|Oberman {{described}} {{her work as}} [...] "A kind of Three Sisters via Woody Allen", reflecting the humour she saw in Chekhov's story. She expanded upon this personal connection in an article for The Guardian: [...] "Chekhov wrote about a world I recognised from my childhood – where intense pain is covered by bravura and humour, and where intense longing is masked by self-deprecation and wit. There was the same obsession with death, the same fierce familial loyalty, the same tendency toward melodrama – {{as well as a}} great passion for food." [...] After returning from Moscow, Oberman continued to work on her reinterpretation for the next 15 years, but lacked the confidence to take her project further. However, after her success in EastEnders she was offered [...] "a lot of work" [...] and was [...] "in a position where I could green-light stuff for myself", determining that [...] "this was the moment <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to make this dream happen".|$|E
