5|$|Banglapedia <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> as {{a general}} encyclopedia. Its purpose {{is to provide a}} {{standard}} desk reference for Bangladeshis, as well as for people interested in Bangladesh, Bengali-speaking people, and related political, cultural and geographical contexts.|$|E
5|$|A {{complementary}} telescope, {{looking at}} even longer wavelengths than Hubble or JWST, was the European Space Agency's Herschel Space Observatory, launched on May 14, 2009. Like JWST, Herschel <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> to be serviced after launch, {{and had a}} mirror substantially larger than Hubble's, but observed only in the far infrared and submillimeter. It needed helium coolant, of which it ran out on April 29, 2013.|$|E
5|$|Banglapedia <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> as {{a general}} {{encyclopedia}} but as a specialized encyclopedia on Bangladesh-related topics. For the encyclopedia's purposes, Bangladesh {{is defined as the}} territory comprising ancient Eastern India, Suba Bangla, Shahi Bangalah, Mughal Suba Bangla, Bengal Presidency, Bengal Province, East Bengal, East Pakistan, and the independent Bangladesh, in historical succession.|$|E

5|$|On 20 {{missions}} (1983–98) the Space Shuttle carried Spacelab, {{designed in}} cooperation with the European Space Agency (ESA). Spacelab <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> for independent orbital flight, but remained in the Shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an airlock. Another famous series of missions were the launch and later successful repair of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and 1993, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Seoul {{was also}} {{the focal point of}} Korea's highway network. It also had several crucial {{connection}} points to the Soviet Union and China, but it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> for military traffic and the weather conditions made travel on the roads difficult. Overall the roads into Korea provided only 48 percent of the capacity of the railroads.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} first instalment, Jumping Flash! 2 was {{developed}} by Japanese developer Exact Co., Ltd however Ultra Co., Ltd {{was not involved in}} development. The game engine and most of the interface were transferred from its predecessor to Jumping Flash! 2 in order to save time during the development. Despite the initial similarities the developers decided to give Jumping Flash! 2 a much larger draw distance, higher quality textures, and updated enemy AI in order to give the game a more memorable first-person 3D perspective. Jumping Flash! 2 <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> to be a technology demonstrator, unlike its predecessor.|$|E
5|$|In the {{election}} of 1796, under the Constitution as it stood then, each of the presidential electors had two votes, which they were to cast for different men. The one who received most votes would become President, the second-most, Vice President. This system <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> with the operation of parties in mind, {{as they had been}} thought disreputable and factious. The Federalists planned to deal with this by having all their Electors vote for John Adams, the Vice President, and all but a few for Thomas Pinckney of South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The Don Valley Parkway, {{along with}} the Gardiner Expressway, is one of Toronto's busiest {{municipal}} routes. It is the sole north–south expressway into Toronto's downtown, a role it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> to support. The parkway was planned {{as one of a}} series of expressways to provide commuter routes to downtown from the expanding suburbs. Two other un-built expressways were planned: the Scarborough Expressway, expected to handle traffic between downtown and the eastern suburbs, and the Spadina Expressway, expected to serve traffic from the north-west.|$|E

5|$|The President of the Italian Republic has an {{official}} standard. The current version {{is based on}} the square flag of the Napoleonic Italian Republic, on a field of blue, charged with the coat of arms in gold. Prior to this the field was solid blue. The current coat of arms, more accurately called an emblem as it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> to conform to traditional heraldic rules, was adopted in place of the royal arms on 5 May 1948.|$|E
5|$|The game {{belongs to}} the Chrono series and is a gaiden, or side story, to the 1995 game Chrono Trigger. It was {{released}} to complement its predecessor's plot, and later served as inspiration for Chrono Cross. It features text-based gameplay with minimal graphics and sound effects, and was scored by composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Unlike many Satellaview titles, Radical Dreamers <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> to lock after {{a certain number of}} playthroughs, so players owning an 8M Memory Pack onto which the game was downloaded can still play today.|$|E
5|$|The keep was {{designed}} as a private tower for Hamelin Plantagenet, rather than a grander residence. As a result, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> to accommodate several different households and its layout was simpler than that seen at the contemporary keep of Orford Castle, for example. The 2nd and the 3rd floor would have served as the main chamber and the lord's private chamber, forming a vertical sequence of rooms, with a vaulted, hexagonal chapel leading off the private chamber, cut into one of the buttresses.|$|E

5|$|Also in 1928, she {{assisted}} in the search effort for the wrecked airship Italia, which had crashed on the polar ice northeast of Svalbard. In addition, Roald Amundsen, who had also joined the search effort, went missing himself. Strassbourg arrived in Tromsø, Norway, on 19 June, to search for both Italia and Amundsen's aircraft. The ship's bow <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> to operate in an Arctic environment, and so the crew had to continually fix wood planks to the hull {{to protect it from}} the ice. While refueling from the tanker Durance, Strassbourg took on two FBA 17 seaplanes to assist in the search effort. On 30 August, Strassbourg located one of the floats from Amundsen's aircraft, confirming the loss of the plane. The search effort was called off on 17 September, and Strassbourg returned to Brest by way of Reykjavík, arriving back in France by mid October.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} spacecraft, the Gemini Lunar Surface Survival Shelter, {{was designed}} to be sent to the Moon ahead of an Apollo mission. It would have landed close to the planned Apollo landing site, and if the Apollo Lunar Module's ascent stage failed to ignite, the crew would have performed an EVA to transfer to the LSSS. The shelter <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> to take off again after landing, so an LSRS or another Apollo mission would then be sent to collect the crew, whilst the Command Module Pilot of the original Apollo mission would have returned to Earth alone aboard his spacecraft. It consisted of a Gemini Reentry Module, which would have housed the astronauts whilst they awaited rescue, and a descent stage containing life support systems, consumables, and the engine and propellant used to land the spacecraft.|$|E
5|$|If {{most of the}} Sea Harriers {{had been}} lost, the GR.3s would have {{replaced}} them in air patrol duties, even though the Harrier GR.3 <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> for air defence operations; as such the GR.3s quickly had their outboard weapons pylons modified to take air-to-air Sidewinder missiles. From 10 to 24 May 1982, prior to British forces landing in the Falklands, a detachment of three GR.3s provided air defence for Ascension Island until three F-4 Phantom IIs arrived {{to take on this}} responsibility. During the Falklands War, the greatest threats to the Harriers were deemed to be surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) and small arms fire from the ground. In total, four Harrier GR.3s and six Sea Harriers were lost to ground fire, accidents, or mechanical failure. More than 2,000 Harrier sorties were conducted during the conflict—equivalent to six sorties per day per aircraft.|$|E

5|$|In 1867 a {{commission}} {{was created to}} look into issues with the central courts, and the outcome were the Judicature Acts, under which all the central courts were made part of a single Supreme Court of Judicature, with the three central common law courts becoming {{three of the five}} divisions of the Supreme Court; this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> to be permanent, but rather to avoid having to retire or demote two of the three Chief Justices to allow a single head of the Supreme Court, as this would have violated the constitutional principle that senior justices were irremovable. By sheer chance Fitzroy Kelly and Alexander Cockburn, Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer and Lord Chief Justice of England respectively both died in 1880, allowing the merger of the common law divisions of the Supreme Court into a single division, the Queen's Bench Division, under John Coleridge, who had been Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas and became Lord Chief Justice of England, by an Order in Council of 16 December 1880. At this point, the Exchequer of Pleas formally ceased to exist.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Democrat Frank Church, a U.S. Senator from Idaho, first {{introduced}} legislation for a feasibility study {{to survey the}} area for national park status. While Church allowed the 1960 feasibility study legislation to die, he introduced a bill in 1963 to create Sawtooth Wilderness National Park, which would primarily encompass the existing Sawtooth Primitive Area. Although the 1963 bill also was not voted on, Church admitted that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> to pass but rather to encourage thorough feasibility studies by both the Forest Service and National Park Service. A 1965 joint report by the two agencies recommended either a national park administered by the National Park Service or a national recreation area managed by the Forest Service. In April 1966, Church introduced two bills, one to establish Sawtooth National Park and another to establish the Sawtooth National Recreation Area (SNRA). The SNRA bill was cosponsored by Republican Leonard B. Jordan, another Senator from Idaho, because it preserved the area while also permitting traditional uses such as logging, hunting, and grazing. The legislation was not supported by Idaho's members of the U.S. House of Representatives.|$|E
5|$|Optically, the HST is a Cassegrain {{reflector}} of Ritchey–Chrétien design, as {{are most}} large professional telescopes. This design, with two hyperbolic mirrors, {{is known for}} good imaging performance over a wide field of view, with the disadvantage that the mirrors have shapes {{that are hard to}} fabricate and test. The mirror and optical systems of the telescope determine the final performance, and they were designed to exacting specifications. Optical telescopes typically have mirrors polished to an accuracy of about a tenth of the wavelength of visible light, but the Space Telescope was to be used for observations from the visible through the ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths) and was specified to be diffraction limited {{to take full advantage of}} the space environment. Therefore, its mirror needed to be polished to an accuracy of 10nanometers, or about 1/65 of the wavelength of red light. On the long wavelength end, the OTA <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>designed</b> with optimum IR performance in mind—for example, the mirrors are kept at stable (and warm, about 15°C) temperatures by heaters. This limits Hubble's performance as an infrared telescope.|$|E
