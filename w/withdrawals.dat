5|$|The St. Johns River {{is under}} {{consideration}} {{as an additional}} water source to meet growing public water needs. In 2008, the river's Water Management District undertook a Water Supply Impact Study of the proposed water <b>withdrawals</b> and asked the National Research Council to review science aspects of the study as it progressed. This resulted {{in a series of}} four reports that assessed the impact of water withdrawal on river level and flow, reviewed potential impacts on wetland ecosystems, and presented overall perspectives on the Water Management District study. The National Research Council found that, overall, the District performed a competent job in relating predicted environmental responses, including their magnitude and general degree of uncertainty, to the proposed range of water <b>withdrawals.</b> However, the report noted that the District's final report should acknowledge such critical issues as include future sea-level rises, population growth, and urban development. Although the District predicted that changes in water management would increase water levels and flows that exceed the proposed surface water <b>withdrawals,</b> these predictions have high uncertainties.|$|E
50|$|Discontinuation of {{baclofen}} can {{be associated}} with a <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome which resembles benzodiazepine <b>withdrawal</b> and alcohol <b>withdrawal.</b> <b>Withdrawal</b> symptoms are more likely if baclofen is used {{for long periods of time}} (more than a couple of months) and can occur from low or high doses. The severity of baclofen <b>withdrawal</b> depends on the rate at which it is discontinued. Thus to minimise <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms, the dose should be tapered down slowly when discontinuing baclofen therapy. Abrupt <b>withdrawal</b> is more likely to result in severe <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms. Acute <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms can be stopped by recommencing baclofen.|$|R
50|$|Kindling due to {{substance}} <b>withdrawal</b> {{refers to the}} neurological condition which results from repeated <b>withdrawal</b> episodes from sedative-hypnotic drugs such as alcohol and benzodiazepines. Each <b>withdrawal</b> leads to more severe <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms than the previous <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome. Individuals who have had more <b>withdrawal</b> episodes are at {{an increased risk of}} very severe <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms, up to and including seizures, and death. <b>Withdrawal</b> from GABAergic-acting sedative-hypnotic drugs causes acute GABA underactivity as well as glutamate overactivity, which can lead to sensitization and hyper-excitability of the central nervous system, excito-neurotoxicity, and increasingly profound neuroadaptions.|$|R

5|$|The {{report also}} noted {{concerns}} about the District's conclusion that the water <b>withdrawals</b> will have few deleterious ecological effects. This conclusion {{was based on the}} model findings that increased flows from upper basin projects and from changes in land use (increases in impervious areas) largely compensated for the impacts of water <b>withdrawals</b> on water flows and levels. Although the upper basin projects are positive insofar as they will return land to the basin (and water to the river), the same cannot be said about increased urban runoff, the poor quality of which is well known.|$|E

40|$|Rationale: It has {{previously}} been shown that drugs, such as benzodiazepines, that inhibit seizure activity during ethanol <b>withdrawal,</b> fail to alleviate the potentiated <b>withdrawal</b> seen following repeated episodes of <b>withdrawal</b> when administered during each <b>withdrawal</b> episode. Acute administration of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor competitive antagonist, CGP 39551, {{has been shown to}} inhibit seizure activity during ethanol <b>withdrawal,</b> and, when administered during the periods of repeated diazepam <b>withdrawal,</b> it blocked the reduction in pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) seizure threshold seen following a final, untreated <b>withdrawal.</b> Objectives: The aim of the current study was to determine if CGP 39551 could alter final ethanol-withdrawal symptoms when administered during the acute intermittent <b>withdrawal</b> periods. Methods: Mice were chronically treated with ethanol-containing liquid diet for either 30 days continuously (single <b>withdrawal)</b> or with 8 -h <b>withdrawal</b> periods on day 16 and day 23 of treatment (repeated <b>withdrawal).</b> Control animals received a control diet for the same period of time. On the final <b>withdrawal</b> animals were tested for behavioural signs of <b>withdrawal.</b> The effect of CGP 39551 administered acutely on <b>withdrawal</b> [up to 5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (i. p.) ] or during the intermittent <b>withdrawal</b> periods (10 mg/kg, i. p.) was examined. Results: Acute administration of CGP 39551 failed to inhibit handling-induced convulsions in the single-withdrawal or repeated-withdrawal group and had no effect on either decreased exploration or increased sensitivity to PTZ seen in <b>withdrawal.</b> Surprisingly, when CGP 39551 was administered during periods of repeated ethanol <b>withdrawal</b> a potentiation of seizure activity was seen in the final, untreated <b>withdrawal.</b> This potentiation of seizure activity, compared with vehicle-treated animals, was not seen when CGP 39551 was given whilst animals had access to ethanol (single-withdrawal group and repeated-withdrawal group where CGP 39551 treatment was non-contingent with <b>withdrawal</b> episodes). However, the decrease in exploration seen during <b>withdrawal</b> was potentiated in repeated-withdrawal animals treated with CGP 39551 irrespective of the time at which the CGP 39551 was administered. Conclusions: Treatment with an NMDA receptor-competitive antagonist potentiated the ethanol-withdrawal syndrome in animals with previous experience of ethanol <b>withdrawal...</b>|$|R

25|$|Diazepam, as {{with other}} {{benzodiazepine}} drugs, can cause tolerance, physical dependence, substance use disorder, and benzodiazepine <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome. <b>Withdrawal</b> from diazepam or other benzodiazepines often leads to <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms similar to those seen during barbiturate or alcohol <b>withdrawal.</b> The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{compared}} knowledge of <b>withdrawal</b> and treatment services among 12 primary heroin injectors (PHIs) and 14 primary amphetamine injectors (PAIs).

Results showed that, on average, knowledge about <b>withdrawal</b> differed depending on the drug used. Specifically, regular amphetamine users knew less about <b>withdrawal</b> from amphetamine, than regular heroin users knew about <b>withdrawal</b> from heroin. In addition, amphetamine users appeared to underestimate the likely length of amphetamine <b>withdrawal.</b> There {{was no difference between}} regular amphetamine and regular heroin users' knowledge of available treatment services, such that both groups knew where to seek assistance for detoxification and rehabilitation. However, both user groups shared some important misconceptions about <b>withdrawal,</b> suggesting a clear need for improved dissemination of educational resources among inner metropolitan intravenous drug users, emphasizing the length and severity of amphetamine <b>withdrawal</b> and the risks associated with excessive self-medication of <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Drug {{addiction}} is maintained by negative reinforcement – alleviation {{of the negative}} <b>withdrawal</b> state. 1 •Acute (one time) administration of morphine, an opiate drug, elicits negative emotional symptoms of <b>withdrawal</b> such as anxiety in rats. 2 •The <b>withdrawal</b> potentiated startle (WPS) paradigm is {{used to assess the}} negative <b>withdrawal</b> state in rats.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Inhalants {{are among}} the most common and {{dangerous}} forms of substance use, but very little research on inhalant use disorders exist. Unlike other substances, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4 th edition (DSM-IV) indicates that inhalants do not have an associated <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome among persons who meet criteria for inhalant dependence. METHODS: Using data from the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, this study examines the prevalence of <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms among inhalant users. Prevalence of inhalant <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms for inhalants was also compared with the prevalence of cocaine <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms to help determine the presence of an inhalant <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome. RESULTS: Approximately 47. 8 % of persons who met criteria for inhalant dependence reported experiencing three or more inhalant-related <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms that were clinically significant. Among those with inhalant dependence, almost half of the <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms were as common as the corresponding <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms experienced by persons with cocaine dependence. Furthermore, the percentage of persons with inhalant dependence reporting clinically significant inhalant <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms was almost equal to the percentage of persons with cocaine dependence reporting clinically significant cocaine <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide evidence for an inhalant-related <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome among persons with inhalant dependence. Revisions to DSM-IV should consider including inhalant <b>withdrawal</b> as a diagnostic criterion for this disorder...|$|R
25|$|Approximately 10% of {{patients}} will experience notable protracted <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms, which can include panic disorder, after discontinuation of benzodiazepines. Protracted <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms tend to resemble those seen {{during the first}} couple of months of <b>withdrawal</b> but usually are of a subacute level of severity compared to the symptoms seen during the first 2 or 3 months of <b>withdrawal.</b> It is not known definitively whether such symptoms persisting long after <b>withdrawal</b> are related to true pharmacological <b>withdrawal</b> or whether they are due to structural neuronal damage as result of chronic use of benzodiazepines or <b>withdrawal.</b> Nevertheless, such symptoms do typically lessen as the months and years go by eventually disappearing altogether.|$|R
25|$|Temazepam, {{like other}} {{benzodiazepine}} drugs, can cause physical dependence and addiction. <b>Withdrawal</b> from temazepam or other benzodiazepines after regular use {{often leads to}} a benzodiazepine <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome, which resembles symptoms during alcohol and barbiturate <b>withdrawal.</b> The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant <b>withdrawal</b> symptoms. <b>Withdrawal</b> symptoms can also occur from standard dosages and after short-term use. Abrupt <b>withdrawal</b> from therapeutic doses of temazepam after long-term use {{may result in a}} severe benzodiazepine <b>withdrawal</b> syndrome. Gradual and careful reduction of the dosage, preferably with a long-acting benzodiazepine with long half-life active metabolites, such as chlordiazepoxide or diazepam, are recommended to prevent severe <b>withdrawal</b> syndromes from developing. Other hypnotic benzodiazepines are not recommended. A study in rats found temazepam is cross tolerant with barbiturates and is able to effectively substitute for barbiturates and suppress barbiturate <b>withdrawal</b> signs.|$|R
