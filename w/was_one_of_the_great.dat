5|$|In the Early Dynastic Period (c. 3100–2686BC), {{the first}} pharaohs built funerary {{complexes}} {{in the religious}} center of Abydos following a single general pattern, with a rectangular mudbrick enclosure. In the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181BC) that followed the Early Dynastic Period, royal funerary monuments greatly expanded, while most divine temples remained comparatively small, suggesting that official religion in this period emphasized {{the cult of the}} divine king more than the direct worship of deities. Deities closely connected with the king, such as the sun god Ra, received more royal contributions than other deities. Ra's temple at Heliopolis <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> religious centers of the age, and several Old Kingdom pharaohs built large sun temples in his honor near their pyramids. Meanwhile, the small provincial temples retained a variety of local styles from Predynastic times, unaffected by the royal cult sites.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{his lack}} of worldly success, Koechlin was {{apparently}} a loved and venerated figure in French music, with his long flowing beard contributing to his patriarchal image. Following his 1888 illness, the need to build up his strength led him to become an enthusiastic mountaineer, swimmer and tennis player. He was also an amateur astronomer and an accomplished photographer. He <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> nature-mystics among French composers, whose personal creed was pantheistic rather than Christian. Though never {{a member of the}} Communist Party he subscribed to its ideals, and in the later 1930s especially was much concerned with the idea of 'Music for the People'.|$|E

25|$|The {{writing that}} had begun so early never left the family. Charlotte had {{ambition}} like her brother (though Branwell was kept {{at a distance from}} her project) and wrote to the poet laureate Robert Southey to submit several poems of his style; she received a hardly encouraging reply after several months. Southey, still illustrious although his star has somewhat waned, <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> figures of English Romanticism, with William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and shared the prejudice of the times: literature, or more particularly poetry (for women had been publishing fiction and enjoying critical, popular and economic success for over a century by this time), was considered a man's business, and not an appropriate occupation for ladies.|$|E
25|$|Frankie Laine was {{somebody}} that everybody knew. He {{was a kind}} of a household word like Frank Sinatra or Bobby Darin or Peggy Lee or Ella Fitzgerald—Frankie Laine <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> popular singers and stylists of that time…And his style…he was one of those artists who had such a unique stamp—nobody sounded like he did. You could hear two notes and you knew who it was and you were right on the beam with it right away. And of course that defines a successful popular artist, at least at that time. These people were all uniquely individual and Frank was on the front rank of those people in his appeal to the public and his success and certainly in his identifiability. — John Williams.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the late}} 1720s, Eugene's {{influence}} and skilful diplomacy managed {{to secure the}} Emperor powerful allies in his dynastic struggles with the Bourbon powers, but physically and mentally fragile in his later years, Eugene enjoyed less success as commander-in-chief of the army during his final conflict, the War of the Polish Succession. Nevertheless, in Austria, Eugene's reputation remains unrivalled. Although opinions differ as to his character, there is no dispute over his great achievements: he helped to save the Habsburg Empire from French conquest; he broke the westward thrust of the Ottomans, liberating central Europe after {{a century and a}} half of Turkish occupation; and he <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> patrons of the arts whose building legacy can still be seen in Vienna today.

25|$|York House, London, <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> {{houses of}} the {{aristocracy}} which lined the Thames during the 17th century. During the 1620s, it was acquired by the royal favourite George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham. The Duke rebuilt and modernised the house and, in 1623, commissioned {{the building of a}} water gate to give access to the Thames from the gardens, at that time the river being a favoured method of transport on London. With the Banqueting House, {{it is one of the}} few surviving reminders in London of the Italianate court style of Charles I. The water gate is believed to have been designed by Stone. However, like the Banqueting House, the design of the water gate has been attributed to Inigo Jones, with Stone only being credited with the building. It has also been attributed to the diplomat and painter Sir Balthazar Gerbier.|$|E
25|$|Because her father, Robert Sidney, was {{governor}} of Flushing, Wroth {{spent much of her}} childhood at the home of Mary Sidney, and Penshurst Place, Baynard’s Castle in London. Penshurst Place <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> country houses in the Elizabethan and Jacobean period. It was a center of literary and cultural activity and its gracious hospitality is praised in Ben Jonson's famous poem To Penshurst. During a time when most women were illiterate, Wroth had the privilege of a formal education, which was obtained from household tutors under the guidance of her mother. With her family connections, a career at court was all but inevitable. Wroth danced before Queen Elizabeth on a visit to Penshurst and again in court in 1602. At this time a likeness of her as a girl in a group portrait of Lady Sidney and her children was painted by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger in 1596, and is now on display at Penshurst. As a young woman, Lady Mary belonged to Queen Anne’s intimate circle of friends and actively participated in masques and entertainments.|$|E
25|$|Despite the flair of Stange's reign, {{it would}} take the more {{tactical}} approach of Mich d'Avray to finally win the NSL Championship. While less flamboyant than his predecessor, d'Avray successfully transformed the team with a different strategy to the previous coaches. The attacking 5–3–2, which saw almost as many goals conceded as scored, was replaced with a 4–4–2. Some may argue that the team began to play a less attractive form of the game, but nobody could argue with the results. In 2001/2, the team nearly went the entire season undefeated with a side that only had former Adelaide City midfielder Brad Hassell as a major addition. After scraping through in the second leg of the major semi final against Newcastle, Glory faced Sydney Olympic in the grand final at a sold-out Subiaco Oval. While the 2000 Final <b>was</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>great</b> games of domestic Australian association football, the 2002 final was a tight and tense affair with Glory hardly getting a shot on target {{due to the fact that}} they lacked any bite in the midfield and had their two strikers marked out of the game. Ante Miličić was on target for Olympic though and his goal early in the second half was enough for Olympic to win 1–0 and break the hearts of Glory fans once again. It was also to be former Socceroo Alistair Edwards final match before retirement.|$|E
