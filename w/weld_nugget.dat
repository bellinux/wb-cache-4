Metallographs {{in the course}} of <b>welding</b> <b>nugget</b> formation were observed and analyzed, through which it was indicated that: in the early stage of <b>welding</b> <b>nugget</b> formation, spot <b>welding</b> of dissimilar materials made liquid metals in the nugget produce a violent stirring action because the electrodynamic force overcame the medium resistance, causing unevenness of elements and compositions in the welding nugget; and then the unevenness was represented by vortex flow by means of different resistances to corrosion. It was proposed that the formation law of <b>welding</b> <b>nugget</b> could be recognized according to the formation law of vortex flow, and the vortex flow often moved from later-molten metal to former-molten metal. The property of welded joint with vortex flow was poorer than that without vortex flow. Vortex flow is a kind of vortex form appearing under a certain action of welding time and welding current upon spot welding of dissimilar materials. In a normal temperature field, the liquid metal upon spot welding of dissimilar materials can stir and mix completely and then generate a mixture with even compositions, through which a reliable <b>welding</b> <b>nugget</b> can be formed.

In order to investigate the effect of double pulsing, the steel was exposed to single and various double pulse RSW schedules. The first current pulse was applied to create the <b>weld</b> <b>nugget,</b> while the second current pulse generated a secondary <b>weld</b> <b>nugget</b> and annealed or (partial) re-melted the primary <b>weld</b> <b>nugget,</b> depending on {{the magnitude of the}} current. The effect of the second current pulse on the <b>weld</b> <b>nugget</b> and heat-affected zone characteristics was investigated using optical microscopy and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). Optical and electron microscopy revealed that the secondary <b>weld</b> <b>nugget</b> is fully martensitic, showing a typical solidification microstructure, while the annealed zone reveals an equi-axed martensitic structure. EPMA results showed that elemental segregation has been considerably reduced in the annealed zone.

40|$|Friction stir welding was {{performed}} to join carbon steel plates at tool rotational rate of 800 - 1400 rpm. Microstructure and microhardness of welded specimens were evaluated across weld centerline. Torque base index, peak temperature, cooling rate, strain, strain rate, volumetric material flow rate, and width of extruded zone at <b>weld</b> <b>nugget</b> were calculated. Peak temperature at <b>weld</b> <b>nugget</b> was similar to 1300 - 1360 K. At this temperature, ferrite transformed to austenite during welding. Austenite was decomposed in to ferrite and bainite at cooling rate of similar to 4 - 7. 5 K/s. The presence of bainite was endorsed by increment in microhardness with respect to base material. Ferrite grain size at <b>weld</b> <b>nugget</b> was finer in comparison to as-received alloy. With the increment in tool rotational rate strain, strain rate, total heat input, and peak temperature at <b>weld</b> <b>nugget</b> were increased.

In the present investigation this welding process is applied to join 1050 cold-rolled aluminium plates. The effects of varying the welding parameters namely welding speed [56, 90 and 140 mm/min] and tool rotational speed [850 and 1070 rpm] on the mechanical and microstructural properties were studied. Vickers micro hardness results across the weldment showed that the <b>weld</b> <b>nugget</b> hardness is dependant upon the welding speed and the tool rotational speed. Increasing the welding speed at 850 rpm reduced the hardness at the <b>weld</b> <b>nugget,</b> whereas, at 1070 rpm the <b>weld</b> <b>nugget</b> hardness merely did not change. However, the hardness achieved at 850 rpm was constantly higher than that achieved with 1070 rpm irrespective to welding speeds.

Interrupted lap shear tests allow to follow the mechanisms leading to weld fracture. A triangular cavity opens at the hook during lap shear testing.

A too short distance favors a fracture through the <b>weld</b> <b>nugget</b> and hence should be avoided.

30|$|Onion-ring {{structures}} in friction-stir welds {{of aluminium alloys}} can be observed as bands in the <b>weld</b> <b>nuggets.</b> Onion-ring structures have notable dark and bright bands, and the spacing between the bands {{is equal to the}} forward motion of the tool in one rotation. In an onion-ring structure, the spacing of the alternate bands increases with the increasing rotations of the tool and increasing material transport per measure of the weld length (Krishnan 2002). The rotary speed of the tool determines the amount of heat produced per unit time and the stirring and the mixing of the material around the pin (Peel et al. 2003). The rotary and traverse speeds of the tool govern the peak temperature generated during welding and the time required for welding of the material. The translation of the tool entrains the material from the advancing side, and the material is rotated around the pin and deposited on the rear of the retreating side. Material carried from the retreating side of the weld is deposited to fill in the material cavity {{in the wake of the}} pin (Krishnan 2002; Nandan et al. 2008). Thus, the FSW nugget consists of a mixture of two streams of material with different histories and mechanical properties, which often leads to an onionskin microstructure.|$|R
