5|$|A two-day {{political}} crisis followed the raid. It {{was obvious to}} the Ottoman government what Enver had allowed to occur. As soon as {{the news of the}} attack reached Istanbul, the Grand Vizier and the Cabinet forced Enver to wire a ceasefire order to Souchon. Several officials, including the Grand Vizier, threatened to resign in protest. Four later would, including Djavid Bey. Though many in the government thought it opportune to attack Russia, solidarity was regarded as vital and a letter of apology was soon drafted. On 31 October Enver informed the Germans of the planned apology and said there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b>|$|E
25|$|By mid-May, {{the army}} had reached the {{vicinity}} of the heavily fortified Persian capital, Ctesiphon, where Julian partially unloaded some of the fleet and had his troops ferried across the Tigris by night. The Romans gained a tactical victory over the Persians before the gates of the city, driving them back into the city. However, the Persian capital was not taken, the main Persian army was still at large and approaching, while the Romans lacked a clear strategic objective. In the council of war which followed, Julian's generals persuaded him not to mount a siege against the city, given the impregnability of its defenses and the fact that Shapur would soon arrive with a large force. Julian not wanting to give up what he had gained and probably still hoping for the arrival of the column under Procopius and Sebastianus, set off east into the Persian interior, ordering the destruction of the fleet. This proved to be a hasty decision, for they were {{on the wrong side of}} the Tigris with no clear means of retreat and the Persians had begun to harass them from a distance, burning any food in the Romans' path. Julian had not brought adequate siege equipment, so there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> when he found that the Persians had flooded the area behind him, forcing him to withdraw. A second council of war on 16 June 363 decided that the best course of action was to lead the army back to the safety of Roman borders, not through Mesopotamia, but northward to Corduene.|$|E
500|$|Digby unsuccessfully {{sought an}} {{audience}} with James to try and explain himself, in Fraser's opinion suggesting either that {{the extent of his}} involvement was limited, or that he was [...] "astonishingly naive and trusting of his sovereign's forgiveness." [...] While imprisoned he busied himself with writing secret letters, smuggled from the Tower and not rediscovered until Kenelm Digby's death in 1675. [...] Although he was fortunate not to suffer the fate of Guy Fawkes, who was tortured on several occasions, one of these letters hints that it had been [...] "in a fashion, offered". [...] He described his refusal to cooperate with his interrogators, boasted of his deceit, and how there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to make the plot appear less abhorrent to fellow Catholics. [...] Digby also carved an inscription on the wall of his cell, extant as of 1996.|$|E

60|$|A {{trace of}} darker color crept into Jimmy's bronze, {{though he was}} aware that candor of that kind is usual on the Pacific Slope, and there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> resent in his companion's manner. However, he made no answer, and the American spoke again.|$|R
500|$|Katzenberg {{moved the}} opening of Antz from spring 1999 to October 1998 to compete with Pixar's release. David Price writes in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch that a rumor, [...] "never confirmed", was that Katzenberg had given PDI [...] "rich {{financial}} incentives to induce them to whatever {{it would take to}} have Antz ready first, despite Pixar's head start". Jobs was furious and called Katzenberg and began yelling. Katzenberg made an offer: He would delay production of Antz if Jobs and Disney would move A Bug’s Life so that it did not compete with The Prince of Egypt. Jobs believed it [...] "a blatant extortion attempt" [...] and would not go for it, explaining that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to convince Disney to change the date. Katzenberg casually responded that Jobs himself had taught him how to conduct similar business long ago, explaining that Jobs had come to Pixar's rescue by making the deal for Toy Story, as Pixar was near bankruptcy at that time. [...] "I was the one guy there for you back then, and now you’re allowing them to use you to screw me," [...] Katzenberg said. He suggested that if Jobs wanted to, he could simply slow down production on A Bug’s Life without telling Disney. If he did, Katzenberg said, he would put Antz on hold. Lasseter also claimed Katzenberg had phoned him with the proposition, but Katzenberg denied these charges later.|$|E
2500|$|Thompson {{was later}} given command of a squadron, {{and carried out}} cruises in the Mediterranean, intercepting French and Spanish ships. [...] He {{returned}} to Gibraltar, but was ordered to sea again in June 1798 to reinforce Nelson's squadron in their hunt for the French fleet that had earlier escaped from Toulon. He was with Nelson when they located the French fleet, {{under the command of}} Vice-Admiral Brueys, moored in Aboukir Bay. In the ensuing engagement Thompson came to the assistance of , which had run aground on shoals in the entrance to the bay. [...] Finding that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> Thompson took Leander into the battle, despite his ship being considerably smaller than the French ships of the line. He anchored between the Franklin and Brueys' flagship the Orient, firing on them in company with [...] and [...] until the Franklin surrendered. [...] Thompson then took the Leander to assist the British attack on the French rear.|$|E
2500|$|In another {{situation}} involving sibling rivalries, David {{is confronted}} by James, who he blames for {{being taken away}} from their mother and being consigned to a worse life with King George. After James knocks David out by using his stun gun, he tricks his niece Emma and Robin Hood to lead him to Zelena's baby. James reveals himself when they reach the rendezvous point, after slapping an anti-magic cuff on Emma, and is joined by Cruella, who is {{still looking for a}} way to escape the Underworld, by stealing Zelena's baby for leverage with Hades. When Cruella and James enter the harbor, as part of their plan to send Emma and Robin to their deaths, David and Hook arrive to rescue Emma and Robin, before it's too late. Hook grabs the gun dropped by James and removed the cuffs from Emma, and Cruella runs back to safety. Meanwhile, David attempts to help James move on while confronting him, as James continues to believe that killing David is the [...] "unfinished business" [...] that is keeping him in the Underworld. After David's plea to help James falls on deaf ears, the twins continue fighting each other on the edge of the dock, with David wanting the others to stay out of the struggle. As James begins to lose, he pulls out a boot knife, despite David's pleas to stop. David eventually twists James off into the River of Lost Souls, condemning him to eternal torment, while Cruella flees the scene. Emma tells her father that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to save James, despite his best efforts, and that some people just won't ever move on.|$|E
50|$|If {{defendant}} {{claims that}} there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{have done to}} make the steps safer {{at the time of}} plaintiff's slip and fall, and plaintiff disputes this allegation, plaintiff may introduce evidence of the subsequent remedial measure to prove that undertaking precautionary measures was, in fact, feasible.|$|R
50|$|Turytt is seen {{during the}} Sinestro Corps War, {{and during the}} debate over Laira's killing of Amon Sur. He also held a vigil for all the fallen Corpsmen the night after Sinestro was defeated. Turytt blames Jordan for Ke'Haan's death {{at the hands of}} the Anti-Monitor, despite the fact that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have done about it.|$|R

60|$|Cole gasped for breath. He was caught. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> More {{soldiers}} were pouring {{down into the}} gulley, surrounding him on all sides. They studied him curiously, murmuring together. Cole shook his head wearily and said nothing.|$|E
60|$|After the mid-day dinner Phil Matlack, {{in a pair}} of high hunting-boots and an oil-skin coat, came to Mr. Archibald {{and said}} that as there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> that afternoon, he would walk over to Sadler's and attend to some {{business}} he had there.|$|E
50|$|He {{reached the}} US and turned {{professional}} in Miami in June 1991. His progress {{as a professional}} was severely hindered by González's refusal to co-operate with trainers or training, feeling as a top Cuban amateur there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> taught. <b>He</b> went through several different trainers during his first few years as a pro, due to his arrogance and laziness.|$|R
3000|$|... “The event {{happened}} {{because of the}} way I acted, you hear that a lot, unrealistic guilt. We had a client who had been beaten unconscious by a group of soldiers who attacked his family and then his mother was killed, so he was actually unconscious at the time she was killed, so there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> have done and he was wracked by guilt” (PC).|$|R
50|$|He {{declares}} {{that he would}} not write his prophesies and revelations because there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> add to the plan of salvation that his forefathers didn't already write first. Besides, there wasn't enough room left on these plates to write very much. But Jarom recommends that his readers go to the other plates that have all the records of the wars between the Nephites and Lamanites.|$|R

6000|$|Still, he {{had been}} happy. He began to realize it, now that these awful girls had come to disturb his peace. The thought filled him with grief and {{rebellion}} and resentment; yet there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> to alter the fact that Donald's [...] "young females" [...] were already here, and prepared, doubtless, to stay.|$|E
60|$|Brooke {{stood still}} and listened {{a moment or}} two while the hoarse roar of a river which he knew was {{swirling}} in fierce flood among the boulders far down in the hollow came up in deep reverberations across the pines. It was a significant hint of what was likely to happen when the pent-up water poured down upon the mine. Still, there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> in that thick darkness.|$|E
60|$|Ben <b>could</b> say nothing; <b>he</b> {{realized}} the whole situation--that the monkey had got the moneybag while Toby was sleeping; {{that in his}} play he had thrown it away piece by piece; {{and he knew that}} that small amount of silver represented liberty in the boy's eyes. He felt that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> say which would assuage Toby's grief, and he remained silent.|$|R
60|$|But, {{though there}} <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> find fault with, the old soldier's prejudices {{were in no}} way shaken, and, indeed, his {{antipathy}} was increased, rather than diminished, by the young officer's conduct towards Aggie. It might be, of course, {{that he was only}} striving to overcome the prejudiced feeling against him; but every time the old soldier saw him with his granddaughter, he felt angry.|$|R
60|$|Carrie {{watched him}} with a {{quietness}} at which she herself marvelled. She had, at least, fancied she felt for him what he had protested he felt for her, but {{now there was a}} stirring of contempt in her. Her reason recognised that he was right, and there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> do; but, for all that, he had been her last faint hope, and he had failed her.|$|R
60|$|She was unchanged, then! This time he {{recognized}} the note of finality in her tone. All the time and thought he had given to this matter were wasted. He had failed, and he knew why. He seldom permitted himself the luxury of anger, but he felt all the poison of bitter hatred stirring within him at that moment, and craving {{for some sort of}} expression. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> nothing he could say. But if Mannering had been within reach then he would have struck him. He rose and walked slowly away.|$|E

60|$|The dull moaning {{had grown}} louder; and now {{ahead of him}} he saw a white line. It {{approached}} with extraordinary rapidity. Knowing the fury with which it would burst upon him, he leapt down, and stood {{at the entrance to}} the cabin, with his head just above the deck. With a deafening roar the wind struck the boat, which staggered as if she had on her full course struck on a rock, while a shower of spray flew over her. Half blinded and deafened, Gervaise crawled into the cabin, closed the door, and lay down there; whatever happened, there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> He was soon conscious that the spar and sail were doing their work, for the boat still lay head to wind. The noise overhead and around was deafening; above the howl of the wind could be heard the creaking of the timbers, and the boat seemed to shiver as each fresh gust struck her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Better, too, {{by a long}} chalk,' he muttered; then perceiving her dismayed expression, he added, 'No, no--I'm {{not talking}} to Tina, only he has {{put me in the}} humour in which there <b>is</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not make me dispute--even my Cherry being the sweetest morsel in the world.

6000|$|... "You go beautifully," [...] said Ransom, {{wanting to}} say {{something}} agreeable, and even respectfully tender, to her, but troubled {{by the fact that}} there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> say that didn't sound rather like chaff. There was no resentment in her, however, for in a moment she said to him, as quickly as it occurred to her, {{in the manner of a}} person repairing an accidental omission, [...] "It was very good of you to come so far." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I {{could hardly}} answer that, you know, as I {{never heard the}} circumstances; but I was given to {{understand}} that Blake consulted McMahon; and that McMahon wouldn't take up the case, as there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> put before the Chancellor. Mind I'm only repeating what people said in Tuam, and about there. Of course, I couldn't think of advising till I knew the particulars.

60|$|That very afternoon, while Chatterer {{was taking}} a nap in his bed in the hollow stump, {{something}} was slipped over his little round doorway, and Chatterer awoke in a terrible fright to find himself a prisoner inside his hollow stump. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> about it but just lie there in his bed, and shake with fright, and wonder what dreadful thing {{was going to happen}} next. He could hear Farmer Brown's boy very busy about something in his cage. After a long, long time, his little round doorway let in the light once more. The door had been opened. At first Chatterer didn't dare go out, but he heard the soft little whistle with which Farmer Brown's boy always called him when he had something especially nice for him to eat, so at last he peeped out. There {{on the floor of the}} cage were some of the nicest nuts. Chatterer came out at once. Then his sharp eyes discovered something else. It was a queer looking thing made of wire at one end of his cage.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Wat Danbury {{was not the}} lad to flinch, and at it he went full split, {{like a man who}} {{means what}} he is doing. She rose gallantly to it, rapped it hard with her front hoof, shook him on to her withers, {{recovered}} herself, and was over. Wat had hardly got back into his saddle when there was a clatter behind him like the fall of a woodstack, and there was the top bar in splinters, the horse on its belly, and the huntsman on hands and knees half a dozen yards in front of him. Wat pulled up for an instant, for the fall was a smasher; but he saw old Joe spring to his feet and get to his horse's bridle. The horse staggered up, but the moment it put {{one foot in front of}} the other, Wat saw that it was hopelessly lame--a slipped shoulder and a six weeks' job. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do,</b> and Joe was shouting to him not to lose the hounds, so off he went again, the one solitary survivor of the whole hunt. When a man finds himself there, he can retire from fox-hunting, for he has tasted the highest which it has to offer. I remember once when I was out with the Royal Surrey--but I'll tell you that story afterwards.|$|E
6000|$|As for Ah Cho, {{after the}} gendarme had struck {{him over the}} head with the butt of the whip and {{commanded}} him in a loud voice to shut up, there remained nothing for him to do but to shut up. The long ride continued in silence. Ah Cho pondered the strange ways of the foreign devils. There was no explaining them. What they were doing with him was of a piece with everything they did. First they found guilty five innocent men, and next they cut off the head of the man that even they, in their benighted ignorance, had deemed meritorious of no more than twenty years' imprisonment. And there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>do.</b> He could only sit idly and take what these lords of life measured out to him. Once, he got in a panic, and the sweat upon his body turned cold; but he fought his way out of it. He endeavoured to resign himself to his fate by remembering and repeating certain passages from the [...] "Yin Chih Wen" [...] ("The Tract of the Quiet Way"); but, instead, he kept seeing his dream-garden of meditation and repose. This bothered him, until he abandoned himself to the dream and sat in his garden listening to the tinkling of the windbells in the several trees. And lo! sitting thus, in the dream, he was able to remember and repeat the passages from [...] "The Tract of the Quiet Way." ...|$|E
50|$|After Abe's network relayed {{a message}} from Victor Dashkov that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> bribed with while he was behind bars, Rose plots with Lissa and Eddie to break {{him out of his}} high {{security}} vampire prison.

Victor agrees to lead them to his brother, Robert, a reclusive spirit user who is rumored to have once returned a Strigoi to their original state.|$|R
