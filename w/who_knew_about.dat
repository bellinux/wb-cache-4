5|$|Crane {{starts to}} believe that a {{conspiracy}} links all the deaths together, so he looks into Van Garrett's last will. Van Garrett had made a new will just before he died, leaving all his possessions to his secret new bride, Emily Winship, whom Crane discovers was pregnant with Van Garrett's child. Crane deduces that all <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> the new will, the marriage and the pregnancy were the victims of the Horseman and that Katrina's father Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon), who would have inherited the fortune, is the person holding the skull. Katrina, finding out that Crane suspects her father, burns all the evidence that Crane has accumulated.|$|E
5|$|Crane later becomes {{suspicious}} when {{he realizes}} the diagram made by Katrina he thought summoned the Horseman is {{really one of}} protection, and also that the corpse of Lady Van Tassel has a wound {{that seems to have}} been caused post-mortem. The corpse is revealed as that of a servant when Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) emerges alive to ambush Katrina. Lady Van Tassel tells Katrina that her family was driven from their ancestral home by the Van Garretts, who then sold it to the Van Tassels. She proceeded to pledge her soul to Satan and become a witch, summoning the Horseman to kill Van Garrett, his son, new wife, unborn child, and every villager <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> his new will, marriage, and child, {{in order to be able}} to claim everything that she deemed to be rightfully hers uncontested. She then sends the Horseman after Katrina to remove the last obstacle to inheriting the combined Van Garrett and Van Tassel estates.|$|E
25|$|Abydos had {{a special}} {{significance}} for her, because it is where she believed Bentreshyt had lived and served in the Temple of Seti. She had made short pilgrimages to the site before, during which she had demonstrated her advanced knowledge. At one of these trips to the temple, the chief inspector from the Antiquities Department, <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> her claims, had decided to test her by asking her to stand at particular wall paintings in complete darkness. She was instructed to identify them based on her prior knowledge as a temple priestess. She completed the task successfully, even though the painting locations {{had not yet been}} published at this time.|$|E

25|$|For a decade, colleges had {{required}} {{science and}} engineering majors to take a course in computer programming, typically using the FORTRAN or BASIC languages. This meant there was a sizable customer base <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> computers. In 1970, electronic calculators were not seen outside of a laboratory, but by 1974 they were a common household item. Calculators and video games like Pong introduced computer power to the general public. Electronics hobbyists were moving on to digital projects such as digital voltmeters and frequency counters. The Altair had enough power to be actually useful, and was designed as an expandable system that opened it up {{to all sorts of}} applications.|$|E
25|$|In sources, Ardashir's {{religious}} {{relations and}} his father being a cleric are mentioned; {{so it can be}} deduced that Ardashir had no connections with royal houses and was only a cleric's son <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> religion, but was not a cleric himself; and that was how he, by his religious knowledge, found the chance to be the first person in his inscriptions receiving the royal ring from Ahura Mazda, something a Persian nobleman did not need and only a newcomer had to claim to be from the line of gods. It should be mentioned that it was not precedent to Ardashir to take a royal ring from Ahura Mazda, and it is not seen even in Achaemenid inscriptions.|$|E
25|$|Lynott's {{last years}} were dogged by {{drug and alcohol}} {{dependency}} leading to his collapse on 25 December 1985, {{at his home in}} Kew. He was discovered by his mother, who was not aware of his dependence on heroin. She contacted his wife Caroline, <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> it and immediately identified the problem as serious. After Caroline drove him to a drug clinic at Clouds House in East Knoyle, near Warminster, he was taken to Salisbury Infirmary where he was diagnosed as suffering from septicaemia. Although he regained consciousness enough to speak to his mother, his condition worsened by the start of the new year and he was put on a respirator. He died of pneumonia and heart failure due to septicaemia in the hospital's intensive care unit on 4 January 1986, at the age of 36.|$|E

25|$|In October 2014, Steve {{thinks he}} may have {{melanoma}} and gets it checked out but is told {{he may have}} depression which he disregards. On the 13th Peter's trial begins and a guilty Steve <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> the affair fears he has ruined Peter's chances of being released but Carla tells the jury on the 15th she believes Peter's innocent making his chances better. While Peter and newfound cell-mate/confidant Eugene Cleland celebrate, murderer Rob yells at Carla making her feel suspicious. At last all is revealed when new evidence emerges and Tracy lures Rob to a derelict factory claiming that they will flee the country together. It is revealed that Tracy lied and had led the police to their location. His name cleared, Peter decides to depart seeing as how there is nothing keeping him in Weatherfield other than son Simon. Peter leaves in November.|$|E
25|$|When {{trustees}} fail {{in their}} main duties, the law imposes remedies {{according to the}} nature of the breach. In general, breaches of rules surrounding performance of the trust's terms can be remedied through an award of specific performance, or compensation. Breaches of the duty of care will trigger a right to compensation. Breaches of the duty to avoid conflicts of interest, and misapplications of property will give rise to a restitutionary claim, to restore the property taken away. In these last two situations, the courts of equity developed further principles of liability that could be applied even when a trustee had gone bankrupt. Some recipients of property that came from a breach of trust, as well as people who had assisted in a breach of trust, might incur liability. Equity recognised not merely a personal, but also a proprietary claim over assets taken in breach of trust, and perhaps also profits made in breach of the duty of loyalty. A proprietary claim meant that the claimant could demand the thing in priority to other creditors of the bankrupt trustee. Alternatively, the courts would follow an asset or trace its value if the trust property was exchanged for some other asset. If trust property had been given to a third party, the trust fund could claim back the property as of right, unless the recipient was a bona fide purchaser. Generally, any recipient of trust property <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> the breach of trust (or maybe ought to have known) could be made to give back the value, even if they had themselves exchanged the thing for other assets. Lastly, against people who may never have received trust property but had assisted in a breach of trust, and had done so dishonestly, a claim arose to return the property's value.|$|E
500|$|The {{match in}} {{question}} was between Zimbabwe and Namibia on 10 March 2003. The match was being played at the Harare Sports Club, {{and was the first}} World Cup match hosted in Zimbabwe. Prior to the protest, the only other Zimbabwean player <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> the protest was Andy's brother Grant. In the end, the pair did not have any black armbands, and so used black insulating tape instead. Shortly before the match, they delivered their 450-word statement to the press.

500|$|The {{circle of}} those at Gruner + Jahr <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> the diaries grew in May 1981 when Fischer decided {{to look into the}} {{complicated}} copyright circumstances surrounding Hitler's property. He discussed the matter with the company's legal advisor, Dr Andreas Ruppert, who advised speaking to Werner Maser, a historian who acted as a trustee on such matters to the Hitler family. Heidemann visited Maser in June 1981 and came to a deal that enabled the journalist and Stern, for a payment of 20,000DMs, to retain [...] "the rights to all the discovered or purchased documents or notes in the hand of Adolf Hitler... which have so far not yet been published".|$|E
500|$|After taking Manila, MacArthur {{installed}} {{one of his}} Filipino friends, Manuel Roxas—who {{also happened}} {{to be one of}} the few people <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> the huge sum of money Quezon had given MacArthur in 1942—into a position of power that ensured Roxas was to become the next Filipino president. Roxas had been a leading Japanese collaborator serving in the puppet government of Jose Laurel, but MacArthur claimed that Roxas had secretly been an American agent all the long. About MacArthur's claim that Roxas was really part of the resistance, the American historian Gerhard Weinberg wrote that [...] "...evidence to this effect has yet to surface", and that by favoring the Japanese collaborator Roxas, MacArthur ensured there was no serious effort to address the issue of Filipino collaboration with the Japanese after the war.|$|E
500|$|At {{some time}} between 1826 and 1830 American artist George Cooke (1793–1849) made {{a copy of}} the {{painting}} in a smaller size, (130.5 x 196.2cm; approximately 4ft × 6ft), which was shown in Boston, Philadelphia, New York and Washington, D.C. to crowds <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> the controversy surrounding the shipwreck. Reviews favoured the painting, which also stimulated plays, poems, performances and a children's book. [...] It was bought by a former admiral, Uriah Phillips, who left it in 1862 to the New York Historical Society, where it was miscatalogued as by Gilbert Stuart and remained inaccessible until the mistake was uncovered in 2006, after an enquiry by Nina Athanassoglou-Kallmyer, a professor of art history at the University of Delaware. [...] The university's conservation department undertook restoration of the work.|$|E

500|$|At {{least four}} plots {{were going on}} in San'a. One was headed by Lieutenant Ali Abdul al Moghny. Another one was {{conceived}} by Sallal. His plot merged into a third conspiracy prodded by the Hashid tribal confederation in revenge for Ahmad's execution of their paramount sheik and his son. [...] A fourth plot was shaped by several young princes who sought {{to get rid of}} al-Badr but not the imamate. The only men <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> those plots were the Egyptian chargé d'affaires, Abdul Wahad, and al-Badr himself. The day after Ahmad's death, al-Badr's minister in London, Ahmad al Shami, sent him a telegram urging him not to go to San'a to attend his father's funeral because several Egyptian officers, {{as well as some of}} his own, were plotting against him. Al-Badr's private secretary did not pass this message to him, pretending he did not understand the code. [...] Al-Badr may have been saved by the gathering of thousands of men at the funeral. [...] Al-Badr learned of the telegram only later.|$|E

Back then—because I didn't know many people in Sweden <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> rap, it was like my own music world—where the lyrics were very direct. So I tried to return to that age when you're so strong and self-confident, while acknowledging there's also a part of being a teenager when you're sometimes very insecure and feel very fragile." ...|$|E
2500|$|Huxley was {{therefore}} {{one of the}} small group <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> Darwin's ideas before they were published (the group included Joseph Dalton Hooker and Charles Lyell). The first publication by Darwin of his ideas came when Wallace sent Darwin his famous paper on natural selection, which was presented by Lyell and Hooker to the Linnean Society in 1858 alongside excerpts from Darwin's notebook and a Darwin letter to Asa Gray. Huxley's famous response to the idea of natural selection was [...] "How extremely stupid not to have thought of that!" [...] However, he never conclusively made up his mind about whether natural selection was the main method for evolution, though he did admit it was a hypothesis which was a good working basis.|$|E
2500|$|Due to {{the vast}} number of slaves <b>who</b> <b>knew</b> <b>about</b> the planned uprising, Vesey feared that word of the plot would get out.

Beginning in May, two slaves opposed to Vesey's scheme, George Wilson and Joe LaRoche, gave the first specific testimony about a coming uprising to Charleston officials, saying a [...] "rising" [...] was planned for July 14. George Wilson was a mixed-race slave who was deeply loyal to his master. The testimonies of these two men confirmed an earlier report coming from another slave named Peter Prioleau. Though officials didn't believe the less specific testimony of Prioleau, they did believe Wilson and LaRoche due to their unimpeachable reputations with their masters. With their testimony, the city launched a search for conspirators.|$|E
