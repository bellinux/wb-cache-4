40|$|OBJECTIVE - To assess {{mortality}} and the psychological repercussions of the prolonged waiting time for candidates for heart surgery. METHODS - From July 1999 to May 2000, using a standardized questionnaire, we carried out standardized interviews and semi-structured psychological interviews with 484 patients <b>with</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> 121 patients <b>with</b> valvular <b>heart</b> <b>diseases,</b> and 100 patients <b>with</b> congenital <b>heart</b> <b>diseases.</b> RESULTS - The coefficients of mortality (deaths per 100 patients/year) were as follows: patients <b>with</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> 5. 6; patients <b>with</b> valvular <b>heart</b> <b>diseases,</b> 12. 8; and patients <b>with</b> congenital <b>heart</b> <b>diseases,</b> 3. 1 (p< 0. 0001). The survival curve was lower in patients <b>with</b> valvular <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> than in patients <b>with</b> coronary <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> and congenital <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> (p< 0. 001). The accumulated probability of not undergoing surgery was higher in patients <b>with</b> valvular <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> {{than in the}} other patients (p< 0. 001), and, among the patients <b>with</b> valvular <b>heart</b> <b>diseases,</b> this probability was higher in females than in males (p< 0. 01).

5|$|Cold shock {{response}} is the physiological response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, {{and is a}} common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, which if underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has {{to work harder to}} pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people <b>with</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown.

40|$|Abstract__ Adults <b>with</b> {{congenital}} <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> form {{a rather}} new phenomenon. Improvements in surgical techniques {{over the last}} decades have lead to lower mortality rates for children born <b>with</b> a congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> enabling more of them to grow into adulthood (Sparacino, 1994; Wren & O'Sullivan, 2001). Today, health care professionals encounter {{the first generation of}} adults <b>with</b> congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> Adults <b>with</b> congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> do not only differ in medical status and history from the well-known cardiac population with acquired cardiac diseases, but also show different psychosocial characteristics and needs. Firstly, the age at onset of the cardiac disease differs considerably for adults <b>with</b> congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> compared to adults with acquired cardiac disease. For adults <b>with</b> congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> the cardiac anomaly may not only affect their present adult life, but it may also have left its mark on their childhood. Experiences of growing up <b>with</b> a congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> might influence the patient’s functioning at adult age. Secondly, when growing up into adulthood, patients may be confronted with new problems associated <b>with</b> congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> in adulthood. These problems might concern finding a suitable employment or getting a mortgage (Allen et al., 1992; Celermajer & Deanfield, 1993; Gersony et al., 1993; Hart & Garson, 1993; Hellstedt, 1994; Mahoney et al., 1991; McGrath & Truesdell, 1994) or they may concern the experience of uncertainties or restrictions regarding sexuality and childbearing (Gantt, 1992; Mahoney et al., 1991; Somerville, 1998; Tong & Sparacino, 1994). Adults <b>with</b> congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> are in the disadvantageous position of being the first generation to experience these problems, since little is yet known about relevant medical and psychosocial aspects. For these reasons, adults <b>with</b> congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> should be considered as a new and distinct patient population with unique characteristics. Therefore, the medical course of congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> into adulthood, as well as the psychosocial development of adults <b>with</b> congenital <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> deserve special attention...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many women <b>with</b> {{structural}} <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> reach {{reproductive age}} and contemplate motherhood. Pregnancy induces and requires major hemodynamic changes. Pregnant women <b>with</b> structural <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> {{may have a}} reduced cardiac reserve. There are no longitudinal data on cardiovascular adaptation throughout pregnancy in women <b>with</b> structural <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> METHODS: Thirty-five women <b>with</b> structural <b>heart</b> <b>disease</b> were included in a prospective observational trial. Maternal hemodynamics were assessed before conception, during pregnancy and 6 months postpartum by transthoracic echocardiography. Uteroplacental perfusion was analyzed by obstetric Dopplers. Longitudinal evolution over time was analyzed {{as well as the}} long term influence of pregnancy on cardiac function. RESULTS: Cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV), left ventricular mass (LV mass) and E/E' ratio significantly increased and ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) decreased during pregnancy. There was a statistically significant difference in EF, FS and E/E' ratio before and after pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristic pattern of hemodynamic adaptation to pregnancy is attenuated in women <b>with</b> structural <b>heart</b> <b>disease.</b> The pregnancy related volume load induces progression of diastolic dysfunction.

Aim To describe the Health related quality of life (HRQOL) of parents whose children are suffering from <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> and to identify {{the most important factors}} that could affect it. Methods A cross sectional study was conducted in Alexandria, Egypt in the two main hospitals that treat children <b>with</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases.</b> 400 parents of children <b>with</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> were recruited and a comparison group (400) of parents of children with minor illnesses were included from both hospitals. Socioeconomic and disease related data were collected, SF 36 was used to collect data regarding the QOL. MANOVA was used to compare the SF- 36 scores between groups and to explore the impact of different variables. Results In all SF- 36 subscales, parents of children <b>with</b> <b>heart</b> <b>diseases</b> reported significantly poorer HRQOL, except for pain subscale. The most striking differences were for General Health, Vitality and role limitation physical.

25|$|Autologous hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (HSCT) {{is based on the}} assumption that autoimmune diseases like systemic sclerosis occur when the white blood cells of the immune system attack the body. In this treatment, stem cells from the patient's blood are extracted and stored to preserve them. The patient's white blood cells are destroyed with cyclophosphamide and rabbit antibodies against the white blood cells. Then the stored blood is returned to the patient's bloodstream to reconstitute a healthy blood and immune system which will not attack the body. The results of a phase 3 trial, the Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation International Scleroderma (ASTIS) trial, with 156 patients were published in 2014. HSCT itself has a high treatment mortality, so in the first year, the survival of patients in the treatment group was lower than the placebo group, but at the end of 10 years, the survival in the treatment group was significantly higher. The authors concluded that HSCT could be effective, if limited to patients who were healthy enough to survive HSCT itself. Therefore, HSCT should be given early in the progression of the disease, before it does damage. Patients <b>with</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> and patients who smoked cigarettes, were less likely to survive.
