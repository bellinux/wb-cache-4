25|$|There can be {{no doubt}} the NSW men are {{improving}} a good deal... They cannot be blamed for the farce, for it <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else.</b> If the Australian team depends on Queenslanders to strengthen it, one is afraid it will be found wanting. They are quite the weakest lot of footballers I have even seen come down from Queensland. The play needs no detailed description as it was simply a practice match for NSW, and certainly did not advantageously advertise the new game.|$|E

Since their departure, the family has even been mocked in an EastEnders official book, entitled EastEnders 20 Years In Albert Square. In the book, the author, Rupert Smith, writes :"Nobody really knew {{what to do with the}} di Marco family, who had been languishing in the pizza restaurant without a decent storyline between them. Finally, there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> for it: the di Marcos would have to go. All of them…it was as if they'd never been".|$|E

Rock and dance music had been dominating the airwaves and charts {{for quite some time}} by that point. The Spice Girls struck at just the right moment with Wannabe; a gutsy, enthusiastic and unashamed pop song we’d all been craving without even realising it.” ...|$|E

Her family is Jewish. She decided to pursue a career in acting because [...] "There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> I wanted to do, ever". She attended Beverly Hills High School (which she later admitted she hated), where she was [...] "something of a loner", and unsuccessfully tried out for several plays. John Ingle, formerly the chairman of the Beverly Hills High School art department, later commented that Kavner was [...] "excellent at improvisation, but she wasn't an ingenue and not that castable at that age".|$|E
500|$|Boito was overjoyed, and Verdi {{reported}} {{that he was still}} working on the opera. The two men met in October or November 1891, after which the Verdis were in Genoa for the winter. They were both taken ill there, and two months of work were lost. By mid-April 1892 the scoring of the first act was complete and by June–July Verdi was considering potential singers for roles in Falstaff. For the title role he wanted Victor Maurel, the baritone who had sung Iago in Otello, but at first the singer sought contractual terms that Verdi found unacceptable: [...] "His demands were so outrageous, exorbitant, [...] incredible that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> to do but stop the entire project". Eventually they reached agreement and Maurel was cast.|$|E

500|$|Takechi's come-back {{films of}} the 1980s were all in a {{theatrical}} hardcore style. Released during {{the dawn of the}} AV, or adult video, and the height of Nikkatsu's softcore Roman porno films, his films fit into neither style. Jasper Sharp writes, [...] "His big-budget pornos came from a different world to that of the pink and Roman Porno films. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> like them at the time, and consequently they had little influence on domestically-produced sex films. Takechi died of pancreatic cancer the following year, on 26 July 1988. Without a major studio's backing or interest from the general pink film community, Takechi's name and films faded into obscurity in Japan. In 2006 his career {{was the subject of a}} full retrospective showing in Tokyo's Image Forum in 2006.|$|E
500|$|David Leitch {{directed}} a scene featuring Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool in December 2016, which {{was believed to}} be intended as a post-credits scene for the 2017 film Logan. This was meant to tease the film Deadpool 2, which Leitch had been hired to direct a month earlier. However, this report was denied by Reynolds, Logan director James Mangold, and star Hugh Jackman. After Logans runtime was extended by three minutes shortly before its release, there was new speculation that a post-credits scene had been added to tease an upcoming X-Men film, but Mangold denied this again, saying that he wanted to [...] "make a movie that begun and ended on its own terms. There <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> to say, because we had said it." [...] Instead, a Deadpool scene was shown as a teaser for Deadpool 2 before Logan, confirmed to be the scene directed by Leitch in December 2016. It was written by Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, writers of the Deadpool films.|$|E

[...] 1UP editor Kat Bailey {{expressed}} concern about which Pokémon could follow the player in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, stating [...] "allowing popular favorites like Charizard would go over quite well". The Daily Cardinal editor Kyle Sparks called Charizard [...] "the most dominant Pokémon in the whole universe, a force of sheer strength". In a poll conducted by IGN, it was voted as the [...] "best Pokémon", where the staff commented about remembering being torn between choosing Blastoise and Charizard {{at the start of}} the game. In a poll by Official Nintendo Magazine, Charizard was voted as the [...] "best Fire-type Pokémon". They stated, [...] "not only is Charizard your favourite fire Pokémon, but it is probably one of the most popular 'mon of all time". Kotaku editor Patricia Hernandez criticized Charizard's Y Mega Evolution for not differing enough from Charizard's original design, while praising Mega Charizard X for changing color, and turning Charizard into a dragon-type. Game Informer ranked Charizard as the [...] "coolest Pokémon out of the original 151", describing it as [...] "Powerful, gigantic, and imposing". They further commented that [...] "Pikachu may be the one you recognize, but Charizard is the one you want." ...|$|E

500|$|The band {{were joined}} by {{familiar}} figures such as Dick Parry and Snowy White, but relations within the band became fraught. [...] Waters took to arriving at the venues alone, departing as soon as each performance was over. [...] On one occasion, Wright flew back to England, threatening to leave the band. [...] The size of the venues was also an issue; in Chicago, the promoters claimed to have sold out the 67,000 person regular capacity of the Soldier Field stadium (after which ticket sales should have been ended), but Waters and O'Rourke were suspicious. [...] They hired a helicopter, photographer and attorney, and discovered that the actual attendance was 95,000; a shortfall to the band of $640,000. [...] The end of the tour was a low point for Gilmour, who {{felt that they had}} by now achieved the success they originally sought, and that there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> they could look forward to. [...] In July 1977 – on the final date at the Montreal Olympic Stadium – a small group of noisy and excited fans in the front row of the audience irritated Waters {{to such an extent that}} he spat at one of them. [...] He was not the only person who felt depressed about playing to such large audiences, as Gilmour refused to perform a third encore. [...] Waters later spoke with producer Bob Ezrin and told him of his sense of alienation on the tour, and how he sometimes felt like building a wall to separate himself from the audience. [...] The spitting incident would later form the basis of a new concept, which would eventually become one of the band's most successful album releases, The Wall.|$|E

[...] When other companies (namely IBM) attempted to create machines with similar performance, they stumbled (Stretch/IBM 7030). Indeed, the 6600 solved a critical design problem — [...] "imprecise interrupts" [...] — that was largely responsible for IBM's failure. He did this by replacing I/O interrupts with a polled request issued by one of 10 so-called peripheral processors, which were built-in mini-computers that did all transfers {{in and out of}} the 6600's central memory. He then further increased the challenge in the later-released 5-fold faster CDC 7600.|$|E

Wade responded, [...] "We cried and burned out uniforms but there <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> we could do." [...] Basketball was revived in 1973, and Wade was asked to coach the team. She coached the women's basketball team to three consecutive AIWA national championships and a 93–4 record, including a 51-game winning streak, at the time, the longest winning streak in women's college basketball. Wade {{was elected to the}} Basketball Hall of Fame in 1985. Today, the Division I women's basketball player of the year receives the Margaret Wade Trophy.|$|E
2500|$|Ordination {{is seen as}} {{a public}} {{ceremony}} of recognition that a man has received and accepted a divine call, and hence is considered to be {{in the office of the}} public ministry. The Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope agrees that [...] "ordination <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>else</b> than such a ratification" [...] of local elections by the people. The LCMS does not believe ordination is divinely instituted or an extension of an episcopal form of apostolic succession but sees the office grounded in the Word and Sacrament ministry of the Gospel, arguing that Scripture makes no distinction between a presbyter (priest) and a bishop (see Treatise on the Power and Primacy of the Pope, paragraphs 63,64, citing St. Jerome). The Augsburg Confession (Article XIV) holds that no one is to preach, teach, or administer the sacraments without a regular call.|$|E
