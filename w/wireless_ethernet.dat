5|$|Despite {{the modest}} {{popularity}} of IBM Token Ring in the 1980s and 1990s, virtually all LANs now use either wired or <b>wireless</b> <b>Ethernet</b> facilities. At the physical layer, most wired Ethernet implementations use copper twisted-pair cables (including the common 10BASE-T networks). However, some early implementations used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations (especially high-speed ones) use optical fibers. When optic fibers are used, the distinction {{must be made}} between multimode fibers and single-mode fibers. Multimode fibers {{can be thought of}} as thicker optical fibers that are cheaper to manufacture devices for, but that suffers from less usable bandwidth and worse attenuation – implying poorer long-distance performance.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} an online algorithm used to detect 802. 11 traffic from packet header data at a monitoring point. Our analysis also {{takes a look at}} how the algorithm behaves when the router closest to the monitoring point is experiencing a high amount of traffic. The algorithm implemented is able to differentiate between 802. 11 (Wireless) and 802. 3 (Ethernet) traffic provided that there is training data between the hosts being analyzed. The training data is generated from TCPDump output by our implementation. Traffic can then be detected online by specifying <b>wireless</b> and <b>Ethernet</b> training data containing the hosts being monitored and redirecting live TCPDump output into our algorithm implementation’s standard input. The experiments showed that the algorithm effectively detects <b>Wireless</b> and <b>Ethernet</b> traffic and applying load at the router does not decreases the detection ratio. ...|$|R
