5|$|A United States Geological Survey {{report in}} the 1960s {{measured}} the concentration of bicarbonate in Mud Creek to range from 41 to 109 milligrams per liter, {{but there were no}} carbonates in the <b>water.</b> <b>The</b> creek's nitrate concentration ranged from 3.3 to 6.3 milligrams per liter for filtered water and the concentration of sulfates ranged from 23 to 29 milligrams per liter, again for filtered <b>water.</b> <b>The</b> concentration of chlorides in the creek's filtered waters ranged from 7 to 23 milligrams per liter. The calcium and magnesium concentrations in filtered water were 20 to 44 and 4.4 to 6 milligrams per liter, respectively.|$|E

"Why, when <b>the</b> <b>water</b> in <b>the</b> sea," [...] {{continued}} Forester, [...] "at {{the mouth}} of the river is very low, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> in <b>the</b> river can flow off more readily, and this makes <b>the</b> <b>water</b> fall in <b>the</b> river itself. On the other hand, when <b>the</b> <b>water</b> in <b>the</b> sea is high, <b>the</b> <b>water</b> cannot run out from the river, and so it rises. Sometimes, in fact, the sea rises so much that <b>the</b> <b>water</b> from <b>the</b> sea flows up into the river, and makes it salt for a considerable distance from its mouth." ...|$|R

5|$|Clay {{is usually}} hard and strong when dry, but becomes very soft when it absorbs <b>water.</b> <b>The</b> dry clay helps hold an earth wall together, {{but if the}} wall is {{directly}} exposed to rain, or to water leaking down from the roof, it may become saturated and collapse.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that hydrogen peroxide is abundant {{across much of}} the surface of Europa. Because hydrogen peroxide decays into oxygen and water when combined with liquid <b>water,</b> <b>the</b> authors argue that it could be an important energy supply for simple life forms.|$|E
5|$|In some {{reactions}} between highly {{reactive metals}} (usually from Group 1 or Group 2) and highly electronegative halogen gases, or <b>water,</b> <b>the</b> atoms can be ionized by electron transfer, a process thermodynamically understood using the Born–Haber cycle.|$|E
25|$|One {{reason for}} {{considering}} it {{as a separate}} ocean {{stems from the fact}} that much of <b>the</b> <b>water</b> of <b>the</b> Southern Ocean differs from <b>the</b> <b>water</b> in <b>the</b> other oceans. <b>Water</b> gets transported around the Southern Ocean fairly rapidly because of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current which circulates around Antarctica. <b>Water</b> in <b>the</b> Southern Ocean south of, for example, New Zealand, resembles <b>the</b> <b>water</b> in <b>the</b> Southern Ocean south of South America more closely than it resembles <b>the</b> <b>water</b> in <b>the</b> Pacific Ocean.|$|R

5|$|The kidneys and {{excretory}} {{system are}} {{much the same}} as in other reptiles, but crocodilians do not have a bladder. In fresh <b>water,</b> <b>the</b> osmolality (the concentration of solutes that contribute to a solution's osmotic pressure) in the plasma is much higher {{than it is in the}} surrounding <b>water.</b> <b>The</b> animals are well-hydrated, and the urine in the cloaca is abundant and dilute, nitrogen being excreted as ammonium bicarbonate. Sodium loss is low and mainly takes place through the skin in freshwater conditions. In seawater, the opposite is true. The osmolality in the plasma is lower than the surrounding water, which is dehydrating for the animal. The cloacal urine is much more concentrated, white, and opaque, with the nitrogenous waste being mostly excreted as insoluble uric acid.|$|E
5|$|The proteobacterium Geobacter {{has also}} been shown to bioremediate uranium in ground <b>water.</b> <b>The</b> {{mycorrhizal}} fungus Glomus intraradices increases uranium content in the roots of its symbiotic plant.|$|E
