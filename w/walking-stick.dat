25|$|The modern tanjō is {{the same}} width as a {{standard}} jō. The tanjō of the Meiji era were thicker {{at the top and}} thinner at the bottom, as was the design of the <b>walking-stick</b> at the time. The original inspiration for the tanjō was the western <b>walking-stick</b> which soon found a practical use in self-defense in the Meiji era.|$|E
25|$|Pauline Pearce, a 45-year-old {{woman from}} Hackney, was filmed {{close to the}} rioting, furiously chastising looters over their {{criminal}} behaviour. She is seen holding a <b>walking-stick</b> and gesturing. The resulting Heroine of Hackney video subsequently went viral.|$|E

60|$|In the {{plantation}} Sir Percival strayed away from us. It {{seems to be}} part of his restless disposition always to separate himself from his companions on these occasions, and always to occupy himself when he is alone in cutting new <b>walking-sticks</b> for his own use. The mere act of cutting and lopping at hazard appears to please him. He has filled the house with <b>walking-sticks</b> of his own making, not one of which he ever takes up for a second time. When they have been once used his interest in them is all exhausted, and he thinks of nothing but going on and making more.|$|R
25|$|When Virgil Earp {{learned that}} Wyatt {{was talking to}} the Cowboys at Spangenberg's gun shop he picked up a 10-gauge or 12-gauge, short, double-barreled shotgun from the Wells Fargo office around the corner on Allen Street. To avoid {{alarming}} Tombstone's public, Virgil returned to Hafford's Saloon carrying the shotgun under his long overcoat. He gave the shotgun to Doc Holliday who hid it under his overcoat. He took Holliday's <b>walking-stick</b> in return. From Spangenberg's, the Cowboys moved to the O.K. Corral where witnesses overheard them threatening to kill the Earps. They then walked a block north to an empty lot next to C. S. Fly's boarding house where Doc Holliday lived.|$|E
2500|$|The crowd, roused by his speech, gave Douglass a {{standing}} ovation. Lincoln's widow Mary Lincoln supposedly gave Lincoln's favorite <b>walking-stick</b> to Douglass in appreciation.

2500|$|Charles Lamb {{established}} the Romantics' attitude to King Lear in his 1811 essay [...] "On the Tragedies of Shakespeare, considered {{with reference to}} their fitness for stage representation" [...] where {{he says that the}} play [...] "is essentially impossible to be represented on the stage", preferring to experience it in the study. In the theatre, he argues, [...] "to see Lear acted, to see an old man tottering about the stage with a <b>walking-stick,</b> turned out of doors by his daughters on a rainy night, has nothing in it but what is painful and disgusting" [...] yet [...] "while we read it, we see not Lear but we are Lear, – we are in his mind, we are sustained by a grandeur which baffles the malice of daughters and storms." ...|$|E

60|$|And so, {{after the}} {{ceremony}} of the <b>walking-sticks,</b> we bid adieu to the lines of Soissons. To-morrow we start for a longer tour to the more formidable district of the Argonne, the neighbour of Verdun, and itself the scene of so much that is glorious and tragic.|$|R
2500|$|Following Ruth Benedict's example, Mead focused her {{research}} on problems of child rearing, personality, and culture. She {{served as president}} of the American Anthropological Association in 1960. In the mid-1960s, Mead joined forces with communications theorist Rudolf Modley, jointly establishing an organization called GYLPHS, inc., whose goal was to create [...] a universal graphic symbol language to be understood by any members of culture, no matter how primitive. In the 1960s, Mead served as the Vice President of the New York Academy of Sciences. She held various positions in the American Association for the Advancement of Science, notably president in 1975 and chair of the executive committee of the board of directors in 1976. She was a recognizable figure in academia, usually wearing a distinctive cape and carrying a <b>walking-stick.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In 1907 Alfred Richardson {{received}} an open testimonial from the Mayor of Halifax. It was: [...] "Testimony of His Worship, the Mayor of Halifax, Alderman R. D. Ward. JP as {{to four years}} of Alfred Richardson as Chief Constable of Halifax." [...] 1907 had seen the Women's Suffrage Movement make its presence known in Halifax, mainly by a local resident named Lavina Saltonstall (1881–1957). Saltonstall was born near Hebden Bridge, Yorkshire, and moved to live permanently in Haugh Road Halifax in 1906. Saltonstall met the suffragette Christabel Pankhurst who had toured the area, especially around 1905/6. She made speeches in Halifax during the tram strike and agitating for reform for women by writing letters. This then evolved into a local suffragette movement in Halifax, which Alfred Richardson had to monitor with care and tact. In 1908 Saltonstall wrote {{an article in the}} local newspaper, The Halifax Guardian, entitled [...] "Our Police System" [...] a by-product of which was to give an insight into the Halifax Police and Chief Constable Richardson. Part of the article stated: [...] "In order to gather a little information, concerning the work of the Police Force, the other day I paid a visit to the Halifax Borough court. First of all I will mention the fact that a friend of mine had business with the Chief Constable, which fact gave us the chance of getting to his office. Presently we came to an inquiry office where we had to await the Chief's pleasure. Photographs of police groups adorned. Presently we received the intimation that the Chief was disengaged, and we walked into another room sumptuously furnished. The Chief himself had taken refuge behind a table on which were books and pens and inks and flowers. Several movable objects in the form of chairs and rulers and books, and also a fire-screen, were placed near him. An ecclesiastical looking individual in belt and buttons, and with a signet ring and a scholarly stoop, he mounted guard over the door by which we had entered. As in the outer office, photographs etc. and the Chief's overcoat, tall hat, and <b>walking-stick</b> adorned the walls." [...] Comments were made in the local press about how well the local constabulary handled the Suffragette Movement in the town from this time (1908) until its demise in 1916. It seems that the Chief Constable met {{with a certain amount of}} approval by Saltonstall.|$|E

50|$|Tourism {{history has}} a long {{tradition}} in the Gauja NP. The first visitors were hiking in the Sigulda area with <b>walking-sticks</b> as far back as in the 19th century. Every year thousands of visitors are attracted by the unique landscape, the largest Devonian rock outcrops - sandstone precipices, rocks and caves, as well as monuments of culture and history, which are twined with many legends and stories.|$|R

60|$|Our way lies {{through a}} {{beautiful}} country, richly cultivated, and luxuriant in its promise of an abundant harvest. Sometimes we pass a field where the strong bristling stalks of Indian corn {{look like a}} crop of <b>walking-sticks,</b> and sometimes an enclosure where the green wheat is springing up among a labyrinth of stumps; the primitive worm-fence is universal, and an ugly thing it is; but the farms are neatly kept, and, save for these differences, one might be travelling just now in Kent.|$|R

60|$|This kind of {{consolation}} {{from the}} world's deceit is very common. Mothers obtain it from their children, and men from their dogs. Some men even do so from their <b>walking-sticks,</b> {{which is just}} as rational. How {{is it that we}} can take joy to ourselves in that we are not deceived by those who have not attained the art to deceive us? In a true man, if such can be found, or a true woman, much consolation may indeed be taken.|$|R
50|$|The {{coach is}} managed by 4 postilions, 9 walking grooms (one of whom walks behind the coach), 6 footmen, and 4 Yeoman of the Guard {{carrying}} their long partisans. Eight of the grooms walk beside the horses. The more ornately dressed footmen walk beside {{the body of}} the coach. The postilions have to handle the horses when the animals are unruly, and they carry crooked <b>walking-sticks</b> to hold up the traces that may become slack when the coach is taking a corner. The royal coachmen are traditionally clean-shaven. The horses are always Windsor Greys.|$|R
5000|$|In 1858, {{while playing}} Lancelot Gobbo at the Princess's Theatre, Harley was struck with paralysis. He died {{two days later}} {{at his home in}} London. His last words were a {{quotation}} from A Midsummer Night's Dream: [...] "I have an exposition of sleep come upon me." [...] He was buried at Kensal Green cemetery on 28 August 1858. Although thought to be thrifty, he died penniless. He had a passion for collecting <b>walking-sticks,</b> canes, &c., and after his death more than three hundred varieties were included in the sale of his personal effects.|$|R

60|$|As sailors, the {{men were}} {{somewhat}} better able to support the dull hopelessness of their lives than others would have been. Most of them were handy {{in some way or}} other, and as they were permitted by the authorities to make anything they could, they passed much of their time in working at something or other. Some cut out and rigged model ships, others knitted, some made quilts from patches purchased for a trifle by the warders for them in the town, some made fancy boxes of straw, others carved <b>walking-sticks,</b> paper-cutters, and other trifles.|$|R
60|$|The {{steps were}} let down, and Elfride was transferred--to the intense delight {{of the little}} girls, and to the mild {{interest}} of loungers with red skins and long necks, who cursorily eyed the performance with their <b>walking-sticks</b> to their lips, occasionally laughing from far down their throats and with their eyes, their mouths not being concerned in the operation at all. Lord Luxellian then told the coachman to drive on, lifted his hat, smiled a smile that missed its mark and alighted on a total stranger, who bowed in bewilderment. Lord Luxellian looked long at Elfride.|$|R

60|$|Here she lay, a shapeless heap, for {{ten minutes}} and more. The morning wind began to boom dully over the flats, and to move afresh dead leaves which had lain still since yesterday. The woman desperately turned round upon her knees, and next rose to her feet. Steadying herself by the help of one crutch, she essayed a step, then another, then a third, using the {{crutches}} now as <b>walking-sticks</b> only.

60|$|First {{was a small}} anteroom, divided {{from the}} inner {{apartment}} by a wainscoted archway two or three yards wide. Across this archway hung a pair of dark-green curtains, making a mystery of all within the arch except the spasmodic scratching of a quill pen. Here was grouped a chaotic assemblage of articles--mainly old framed prints and paintings--leaning edgewise against the wall, like roofing slates in a builder's yard. All the books visible here were folios too big to be stolen--some lying on a heavy oak table in one corner, some on the floor among the pictures, the whole intermingled with old coats, hats, umbrellas, and <b>walking-sticks.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Some of {{them were}} fairly presentable; {{and they were all}} Christian martyrs {{compared}} to Rowley; but they were in a frolicsome and rollicking humour that promised danger as we approached the town. They sang songs, they ran races, they fenced with their <b>walking-sticks</b> and umbrellas; and, in spite of this violent exercise, the fun grew only the more extravagant with the miles they traversed. Their drunkenness was deep-seated and permanent, like fire in a peat; or rather--to be quite just to them--it was not so much to be called drunkenness at all, as the effect of youth and high spirits--a fine night, and the night young, a good road under foot, and the world before you! ...|$|R
