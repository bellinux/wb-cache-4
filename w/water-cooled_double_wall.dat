40|$|For {{active control}} {{purposes}} a <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> structure enables {{the measurement of}} a time advanced reference signal for a feedforward system because the reference signal can be measured at the primary panel and the control system {{can be applied to}} the second panel. In aerospace engineering these <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> sections are often filled with absorbent materials. These materials have an influence on the structural dynamics of the <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> section. In order to guarantee the function of the feedforward control system the damped <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> section has to show a linear system behavior. In order to analyze the linearity of <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> panels with different absorbent materials this study experimentally investigates different damping concepts on a simple <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> structure. The <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> structure is a buildup with two 0. 8 x 0. 6 m² aluminum plates and different damping concepts are applied to the cavity between. The absorbent material is added to the secondary panel where glass wool in different configurations or constraint layer damping is applied. The linear system behavior up to 500 Hz can be verified with the coherence function for all concepts. Above 500 Hz it can be shown that the test set-up has a substantial effect on the dynamics of the <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> section...|$|R

The US modules of the International Space Station (ISS), with their "bumper shields" offset from their pressure holding rear walls provide good examples of effective on-orbit use of the <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> shield. The concentric cylinder shield configuration with its large radius of curvature relative to separation distance is easily and effectively represented for testing and analysis as a system of two parallel plates.

This complicates assessment of critical spacecraft components located within outer spacecraft walls when using software tools such as NASA's BumperII.

40|$|The finite {{layer method}} (FLM) is {{presented}} as a discretisation technique for the computation of noise transmission through <b>double</b> <b>walls.</b> It combines a finite element method (FEM) discretisation in the direction perpendicular to the wall with trigonometric functions in the two in-plane directions. It is used for solving the Helmholtz equation at the cavity inside the <b>double</b> <b>wall,</b> while the wall leaves are modelled with the thin plate equation and solved with modal analysis. Other approaches to this problem are described here (and adapted where needed) in order to compare them with the FLM. They range from impedance models of the <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> behaviour to different numerical methods for solving the Helmholtz equation in the cavity. For the examples simulated in this work (impact noise and airborne sound transmission), the former are less accurate than the latter at low frequencies. The main advantage of FLM over the other discretisation techniques is the possibility of extending it to multilayered structures without changing the interpolation functions and with an affordable computational cost. This potential is illustrated with a calculation of the noise transmission through a multilayered structure: a <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> partially filled with absorbing material.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the transmission of}} sound through lightweight parallel plates, (plasterboard <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> partitions and timber floors). Statistical energy {{analysis was used to}} assess the importance of individual transmission paths and to determine the overall performance. Several different theoretical models were developed, the choice depending on the frequency range of interest and method of attachment of the plates, whether point or line, to the structural frame. It was found that for a line connected <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> there was very good agreement between the measured and predicted results, where the dominant transmission path was through the frame and the cavity path was weak. The transition frequency where the coupling changes from a line to a point connection is when the first half wavelength is able to fit between the spacings of the nails. For point connected <b>double</b> <b>walls,</b> where the transmission through the frame was weaker than for line connection, the cavity path was dominant unless there was absorption present. When the cavity was sufficiently deep, such that it behaved more like a room, the agreement between the measured and predicted results was good. As the cavity depth decreases the plates of the <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> are closer together and the agreement between the measured and predicted results were not as good. Detailed experiments were carried out to determine the transmission into the <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> cavities and isolated cavities. It was found that the transmission into an isolated cavity could be predicted well. However, for transmission into <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> cavities the existing theories could not predict transmission accurately when the cavity depth was small. Extensive parametric surveys were undertaken to analyse changes to the sound transmission through these structures when the material or design parameters are altered. The SEA models are able to identify the dominant mechanisms of transmission and will be a useful design tool in the design of lightweight partitions and timber floors.

40|$|Sound {{transmission}} through walls {{varies with}} {{the frequency of the}} sound and the mass and stiffness of the construction. An effective way of obtaining a large amount of sound insulation for a given weight per unit area is by means of a <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> construction. For simplicity, consider a <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> made of two single panels, each of which alone would have the mass law transmission loss characteristic. Place these two panels m_ 1 and m_ 2 parallel to each other at a distance d apart, with only air in space between. Assume that the panels are very large and that they are clamped around the edges {{in such a way that}} there is no flanking. The air space between the two panels behaves like a simple spring. The stiffness of this spring is inversely proportional to the spacing. The two panels are simply two masses, one on each end of the spring. The transmission loss of the <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> increases as the separation of the two parts of the <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> increase, provided the distance between them is less than a wave length, and the combined transmission loss of two panels should be the sum of the transmission losses for the separate panels when the distance between them is much greather than the wave length of the transmitted sound. Sound is not transmitted in vacuum space. If the pressure of the space between walls is very small, it is possible for the transmission loss to become even greater than the value as discussed above.
