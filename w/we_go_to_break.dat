Self-Synchronizing Stream Ciphers (SSSC) are a {{particular}} class of symmetric encryption algorithms, {{such that the}} resynchronization is automatic, in case of error during the transmission of the ciphertext. In this paper, we extend the scope of chosen-ciphertext attacks against SSSC. Previous {{work in this area}} include the cryptanalysis of dedicated constructions, like KNOT, HBB or SSS. <b>We</b> <b>go</b> further <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the last standing dedicated design of SSSC, i. e. the ECRYPT proposal MOSQUITO. Our attack costs about 2 70 computation steps, while a 96 -bit security level was expected. It also applies to ΓΥ (an ancestor of MOSQUITO) therefore the only secure remaining SSSC are blockcipher-based constructions. ...|$|R
