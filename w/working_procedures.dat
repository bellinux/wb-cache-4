Traditional cost control and management are almost dominated by after-costing in mainland. Prior-cost estimation is generally based on statistical result of historical cost data.

The prior-estimation of process-based cost of railway transportation equipments is researched and practiced from the product manufacturing process. In the view of refined management of costs, {{the constitution of the}} process cost is analyzed in manufacturing process of railway transportation equipments, and it is presented that a mathematical model of cost estimation based on <b>working</b> <b>procedure.</b> Enterprise could know the process cost of a product before it is manufactured by it.
