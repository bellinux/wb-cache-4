5|$|A {{significant}} event now occurred which {{granted the}} Japanese forces a reprieve. Early on 3 November, Marine units near Koli Point, {{east of the}} Lunga Perimeter, engaged 300 fresh Japanese troops that had just been landed by a Tokyo Express mission of five destroyers. This, plus the knowledge that {{a large body of}} Japanese troops <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> relocating to Koli Point after the defeat in the Henderson Field battle, led the Americans to believe that the Japanese were about to conduct a major attack on the Lunga Perimeter from the Koli Point area.|$|E
5|$|According to statistics, the South Okanagan {{region is}} underserved {{in terms of}} airports, owing to its population. The Kelowna International Airport {{provides}} international flights to 62commercial destinations daily. South Okanagan is home to 79,475people, totaling 25percent of the Okanagan area as a whole. The air travel market of the local area consists of 210,000passengers yearly. However, in 1990, the Penticton Regional Airport {{was considered to be}} the area's primary airport, hence why people questioned the need to expand the Kelowna International Airport at that time, when its runway <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> expansion.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the Sicilian {{campaign}} Durnford-Slater {{took over}} command of a brigade-sized element consisting of No. 3 and No. 40 (Royal Marine) Commando and the Special Raiding Squadron and as a result Peter Young took over command of the unit. Following this, in late August 1943, after receiving replacements from No. 12 Commando which <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> being disbanded, the unit carried out a number of reconnaissance operations across the Strait in preparation for the invasion of Italy.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} {{contract}} {{negotiations with the}} Amalgamated Transit Union (ATU) were due again {{at the end of}} 1986, the bus line <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> being sold to Dallas-based investors.

5|$|Even {{before the}} Vietnam War ended, the {{relationship}} between the Khmer Rouge—which <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> seizing power from a US-backed regime headed by Lon Nol—and North Vietnam was strained. Clashes between Vietnamese communists and Khmer Rouge forces began as early as 1974, and the following year Pol Pot signed a treaty codifying the ‘friendship’ between the Khmer Rouge and China.|$|E
5|$|Following Hungary's {{membership}} of NATO in 1999, {{there were several}} proposals to achieve a NATO-compatible fighter force. Considerable attention went into studying second-hand aircraft options as well as modifying the nation's existing MiG-29 fleet. In 2001, Hungary received several offers of new and used aircraft from various nations, including Sweden, Belgium, Israel, Turkey, and the US. Although the Hungarian government initially intended to procure the F-16, in November 2001 it <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> negotiating a 10-year lease contract for 12 Gripen aircraft, with an option to purchase the aircraft {{at the end of}} the lease period.|$|E
5|$|From 2011 to 2015, {{the village}} was {{involved}} in an annexation proposal with the town of Ossining. A petition circulated in Ossining election districts 17 and 20 (comprising 1,600 people), which was signed by about 20 percent of the residents. The petition was filed in October 2013, and a public hearing was held with both government boards in December 2013. In March 2014, Briarcliff's board approved the proposal, and Ossining's board rejected it. In 2014, Briarcliff Manor <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> appealing the issue to the Appellate Division Court, though in May 2015 the Briarcliff board voted to discontinue its appeal.|$|E

5|$|In January 2006, Disney bought Pixar in a {{deal that}} put Pixar chiefs Edwin Catmull and John Lasseter {{in charge of all}} Disney Animation. Shortly thereafter, Circle 7 Animation was shut down and its version of Toy Story 3 was cancelled. The {{following}} month, Disney CEO Robert Iger confirmed that Disney <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> transferring the production to Pixar. John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter, and Lee Unkrich visited the house where they first pitched Toy Story and came up with the story for the film over a weekend.

5|$|Madonna became {{interested}} in collaborating with Timberlake after hearing his 2006 album FutureSex/LoveSounds. Together they developed a number of songs for the album, but {{the basis of the}} development was Pharrell Williams' demos. Madonna had a number of songs written down for the album, which amazed Timberlake. They had intensive discussions among themselves before recording a song. Later, Madonna recalled that most of the songs on Hard Candy were autobiographical in many respects. However, according to her this was not intentional and happened while she <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> developing the album.|$|E

5|$|Olds was {{assigned}} to command the 71st Fighter Squadron, which was soon detached from the 1st FG to the Air Defense Command and based at the Greater Pittsburgh Airport in Pennsylvania.

5|$|Ross disagreed, {{reasoning}} {{this would}} only damage relations between Britain and Portugal, an undesirable prospect given the countries' common membership in NATO, the European Free Trade Association and more. There was much at stake; Britain enjoyed an annual £48million trade surplus with Portugal, and Portuguese Railways <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> buying 50 diesel locomotives from English Electric. In the Azores archipelago, Portugal provided NATO with a strategically key air base, which was unprotected by treaty; given the inclination, Lisbon might close it.|$|E
5|$|Since {{achieving}} {{independence from}} Yugoslavia, Croatia has submitted 26 films for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film as of 2016, but none have {{been nominated for}} an Oscar.

Since independence, five Croatian directors have had multiple films submitted to the Academy for review.
