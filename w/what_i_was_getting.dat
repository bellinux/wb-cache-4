500|$|Richard Elfman {{had never}} gone to film school when {{production}} started, and [...] "I didn't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> into." [...] The production, {{from its original}} 16mm roots to its finish, took three years. Cast and crew members would sleep on the film's stage, wearing spare gorilla suits to stay warm. Among the film's artistic influences included 1940s big band and jazz music and Max Fleischer cartoons of the 1930s (such as Betty Boop). Some of the film's cast {{was made up of}} non-professionals cast off the street. In one scene, Richard Elfman brought in a young man to mouth the words of [...] "Bim Bam Boom", but when he was put in front of the camera, he stood there as the scene was shot. Elfman left the scene in the film by editing in Bright's lips over the actor's face. Another scene featured homeless men.|$|E

Turner and Michael H. Price. “It’s phonetic Hebrew—that’s what it is, all right—and that’s <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> at with the name Yokum, more so than any attempt to sound hickish," [...] said Capp. [...] "That was a fortunate coincidence, of course, that the name should pack a backwoods connotation. But it’s a godly conceit, really, playing off a godly name—Joachim means 'God’s determination', something like that—that also happens to have a rustic ring to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{the tour}} began {{to sell out}} all over Europe and the UK, many fans speculated that Minogue would bring her tour to Australia and Japan. While {{promoting}} her ITV special, The Kylie Show on [...] "Sunrise", she stated: [...] "I {{just want to have}} in my head more solidly what the tour will be and if I can manage what I have so far, I would love to come back [...] ". It was later revealed that Minogoue would bring a limited numbers of shows to her home country, stating, [...] "The reason I hadn't confirmed dates in Australia is I really didn't know <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> into [...] But now I know".|$|E

2500|$|Friedrich Nietzsche famously {{suggested}} that an ancient, metaphysical {{belief in the}} divinity of Truth {{lies at the heart}} of and has served as the foundation for the entire subsequent Western intellectual tradition: [...] "But you will have gathered <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>getting</b> at, namely, that it is still a metaphysical faith on which our faith in science rests—that even we knowers of today, we godless anti-metaphysicians still take our fire too, from the flame lit by the thousand-year old faith, the Christian faith which was also Plato's faith, that God is Truth; that Truth is 'Divine'..." ...|$|R

60|$|Well, {{we got him}} off to bed, him and his infernal Venus, and {{we settled}} down to take a steady look at the {{position}} of affairs.

"That is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> at when, {{three years}} ago, I made an attack upon Democracy {{to the mother}} society of this society, an attack that I {{expressed}} ill and failed to drive home. That is what I have come down now {{to do my best}} to make plainer. This age of confusion is Democracy; it is all that Democracy can ever give us. Democracy, if it means anything, means the rule of the planless man, the rule of the unkempt mind. It means as a necessary consequence this vast boiling up of collectively meaningless things.|$|E
60|$|MURRAY. And I meant it! This {{place is}} {{honestly}} like heaven to me--a lonely heaven till your arrival. (Eileen looks embarrassed.) And why wouldn't it be?

6000|$|This, in the {{optimism}} of the hour, I {{have no memory}} of resenting; the page, though slow, managed {{at the same time to}} be stirring, and I asked no more of any one or anything but that they should be with all due gothicism whatever they most easily might. The long vistas of the beeches and poplars on the other side of the Rhine, after we had crossed by the funicular ferry, gothically rustled and murmured: I fancied their saying perpetually [...] "We are German woods, we are German woods--which makes us very wonderful, do you know? and unlike any others: don't you feel the spell of the very sound of us and of the beautiful words, 'Old German woods, old German woods,' even if you can't tell why?" [...] I couldn't altogether tell why, but took everything on trust as mystically and valuably gothic--valuably because ministering with peculiar directness, as I gathered, to culture. I was in, or again I was [...] "out," [...] in my small way, for culture; which seemed quite to come, come from everywhere at once, with the most absurd conciliatory rush, pitifully small as would have been any list of the sources I tapped. The beauty was in truth that everything was a source, giving me, by the charmingest breach of logic, more than it at all appeared to hold; which was exactly what had not been the case at the Institution Rochette, where things had appeared, or at least had pretended, to hold so much more than they gave. The oddity was that about us now everything--everything but the murmur of the German woods and the great flow and magic name of the Rhine--was more ugly than beautiful, tended in fact to say at every turn: [...] "You shall suffer, yes, indeed you are doing so (stick up for your right to!) in your sense of form; which however is quite compatible with culture, is really one of the finest parts of it, and may decidedly prove to you that you're getting it." [...] I hadn't, in rubbing, with whatever weakness, against French and, so far as might be, against France, and in sinking, very sensibly, more and more into them, particularly felt that I was getting it as such; <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> as such was decidedly rather my famous [...] "life," [...] and without so much as thinking of the degree, with it all, of the valuable and the helpful.|$|E

5000|$|Swope left Harvard at {{the start}} of World War II to work for the Hydrographic office at MIT. In her Oral History, she says, [...] "...they said, 'How much were you getting Harvard?'

5000|$|For both Marian and Warren, the {{assignment}} {{came on the}} heels of flying the airline's other great adventure of the late 1940s: the Berlin Airlift. [...] "I had no idea <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>getting</b> into, absolutely none", remembered Warren, who retired in 1979 as Alaska's chief pilot and vice president of flight operations. [...] "It was pretty much seat-of-the-pants flying in those days. Navigation was by dead reckoning and eyesight. Planes were getting shot at. The airport in Tel Aviv was getting bombed all the time. We had to put extra fuel tanks in the planes so we had the range to avoid landing in Arab territory." ...|$|E
5000|$|Taking a more {{negative}} view in 2005, Groskop recalled: “I remember asking a (female) newspaper editor 10 years ago {{if it was}} necessary to have a womens page in the paper.

Result: difficulty of earning dividend, over-work, over- worry, constant fear of being wound up. Now, there is that about your work that suggests to me you would be happier earning five hundred a year than you ever will be earning two thousand. To pay your dividend--to earn your two thousand--you have to do work that brings you no pleasure in the doing. Content with five hundred, you could afford to do only that work that does give you pleasure. This is not a perfect world, we must remember. In the perfect world the thinker would be worth more than the mere jester. In the perfect world the farmer would be worth more than the stockbroker. In making the exchange I had to write myself down. I earn less money, but get more enjoyment out of life. <b>I</b> used to <b>be</b> able to afford champagne, but my liver was always wrong, and I dared not drink it. Now I cannot afford champagne, but I enjoy my beer. That is my theory, {{that we are all}} of us entitled to payment according to our market value, neither more nor less. You can take it all in cash.

5000|$|For Powers, the {{epigraph}} {{has come}} to stand for: [...] "the lack of control soldiers have over what happens to them.
