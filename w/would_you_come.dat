6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} have. Goodness gracious me! Why else <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>come?</b> You have got Buston, which I suppose is two {{thousand}} a year. At any rate {{it has that}} name. But it isn't your own." ...|$|E
6000|$|When I {{was shut}} {{out with her}} in the hall, she said, holding up her hands, [...] "Oh, if you please, miss, Mr. Carstone says <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> upstairs to Mr. Skimpole's room. He has been took, miss!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, [...] "where else <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> to? Whenever {{you want}} it there's room here for you. Walter, take his horse, and then spread his {{blankets}} out near the fire. Tom, you'll get another trout and fill the kettle." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I fancy she is, Mr. Reginald. He didn't say as much, {{but only}} {{that there would}} be three or four,--a couple of ladies he said, and perhaps more.

6000|$|... 'Such {{a number}} of nights,' said the girl, {{with a touch of}} woman's tenderness, which communicated {{something}} like sweetness of tone, even to her voice: 'such {{a number of}} nights as I've been patient with you, nursing and caring for you, as if you had been a child: and this the first that I've seen you like yourself; you wouldn't have served me as you did just now, if you'd thought of that, <b>would</b> <b>you?</b> <b>Come,</b> come; say you wouldn't.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{young man}} had not been seen by Linda's eyes for nearly a month, when Peter Steinmarc and Madam Staubach settled between them that the ice should be broken. On the {{following}} morning aunt Charlotte prepared herself for the communication to be made, and, {{when she came in}} from her market purchases, went at once to her task. Linda was found by her aunt in their lodger's sitting-room, busy with brooms and brushes, while Tetchen on her knees was dry-rubbing the polished board round the broad margin of the room. [...] "Linda," [...] said Madame Staubach, [...] "I have that which I wish to say to you; <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> with me for a while?" [...] Then Linda followed her aunt to Madame Staubach's own chamber, and as she went there came over her a guilty fear. Could it be that her aunt had heard of the words which the {{young man had}} spoken to her? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] {{she went}} on. [...] "He came when I was undressing for bed. I heard the horse. He {{knocked on the}} door. Something terrible {{happened}} to me then. I felt sick and my head wasn't clear. I remember next--his being in the room--the lamp was out--I couldn't see very well. He thought I was sick {{and he gave me}} a drink and let the air blow in on me through the window. I remember I lay back in the chair and I thought. And I listened. When <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>come?</b> I didn't feel that you could leave me there alone with him. For his coming was different this time. That pain like a blade in my side!... When it came I was not the same. I loved you. I understood then. I belonged to you. I couldn't let him touch me. I had never been his wife. When I realized this--that he was there, that you might suffer for it--I cried right out.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] cried Lawyer Gooch, in amazement. [...] "What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> do? <b>Come,</b> Mr. Billings, {{and face}} your erring but {{innocent}} wife. Our combined entreaties cannot fail to--" ...|$|R

5000|$|One {{night in}} Mumbai, India, {{where he was}} {{producing}} a song for UK Asian artist Amar, Sigsworth composed a tune on his Yamaha QY20 pocket sequencer. As soon as he arrived back in London, he took it to Imogen Heap, {{and asked her to}} write a top line for it. It became [...] "Flicks", their first song for what would become the Frou Frou album Details. Originally, there was no plan for Sigsworth and Heap to form a [...] "proper" [...] band. It was simply a matter of Sigsworth wanting to hear various song ideas properly realized. As Heap says: [...] "Every month or so Guy would phone me up and say 'I've got a new song, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> in and sing it?' and then before we knew it we'd already started the album." ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{received}} a small grant {{to continue his}} education at the University of Cambridge, where he studied philosophy under R. B. Braithwaite at Trinity Hall; among others, he was taught by Ludwig Wittgenstein. Professor Braithwaite was exceedingly kind to his refugee student. On one occasion, Braithwaite invited him to his home saying, [...] "Someone {{has given me a}} Hungarian salami; <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> to my house and show me how to eat it?" [...] Such invitations were welcome since Stephan made little money as a waiter in a Greek restaurant and survived on [...] "one fourpenny meat pie per day." [...] In 1943 he was recalled to the Czechoslovak army, serving as a sergeant in the infantry during the push through France and into Germany. He would later say that he survived the fighting outside Dunkirk due to Dickens; recuperating in hospital from a minor wound, a doctor refused to discharge him until he had had another day to finish his novel. As a result, he missed the heavy fighting the next day, when many of his close friends were killed.|$|E
6000|$|Let as {{not talk}} of this! Let us go hence: Is not the barrier broken down between us? What <b>would</b> <b>you</b> more? <b>Come,</b> {{it is almost}} morning. [Puts her hand on GUIDO'S.] ...|$|R

[...] "I thought <b>you</b> <b>would</b> never <b>come.</b> <b>You</b> must have walked to Dedham this time. Who {{do you think is}} here? Mr. Worthington." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Aerosmith song [...] "Livin' on the Edge" [...] (1993) has {{the lines}} [...] "If Chicken Little {{tells you that}} the sky is falling, Even if it wasn't <b>would</b> <b>you</b> still <b>come</b> {{crawling}} back again?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The three {{verses of}} the song are each a plea from the narrator to a woman he hopes will join him in, respectively, Boston, Denver, and Los Angeles, with each verse concluding: [...] "She said 'No - boy <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> home to me'"; the woman's {{sentiment}} is elaborated on in the chorus which concludes with the line: [...] "I'm the number one fan of the man from Tennessee." [...] Tennessee is the home state of Dave Loggins, who has said of [...] "Please Come to Boston" [...] - [...] "The story is almost true, except there wasn't anyone waiting so I made her up. In effect, making the longing for companion stronger. It was a recap to my first trip to each of those cities...and how I saw each one. The fact of having no one {{to come home to}} made the chorus easy to write. Some forty years later, I still vividly remember that night composition, {{and it was as if}} someone else was writing the song." ...|$|E
5000|$|Well what {{happened}} was I was asked to be on Seinfeld. They said: [...] "Would you do a Seinfeld?" [...] And I said, and I just happened to know to see a few Seinfelds and I knew these guys were really tops; they were really, really clever guys, and I liked the show. And so I said [...] "Sure!" [...] and I thought they would ask me to do a walk-on, the way it came: [...] "Would you come {{be part of the}} show?" [...] And I said [...] "Yeah, sure I'll do it." [...] You know what I mean? Then I got the script and my name was on every page because it was about my car. And I laughed; it was hysterically funny. So I was really delighted to do it. The writer {{came up to me and}} he said [...] "Jon, <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> take a look at my car to see if you ever owned it?", because the writer wrote it from a real experience where someone sold him the car based on the fact that it was my car. And I went down and I looked at the car and I said [...] "No, I never had this car." [...] So unfortunately I had to give him the bad news. But it was a funny episode.|$|E
40|$|Almost all {{available}} statistical packages {{are capable of}} performing Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) from raw data. Some of statistical packages have capability to perform independent sample t-test, and some other tests of significance on summary data, but seldom <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>come</b> across a software that has the capability to perform ANOVA directly on summary data. However some packages can perform one-way ANOVA after generating surrogate data from summary statistics. In this short note we have given STATA program to perform one-way ANOVA on summary data; in addition this program also performs Bartllet&rsquo;s tests of equality of variances. The idea can be extended to two-way and higher way ANOVA&rsquo;s. Examples have been given for illustration...|$|E
