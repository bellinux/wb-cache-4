2500|$|In {{another popular}} story, the 19th-century monk named Ter Karapet Hovhanesi-Hovakimyan, from a monastery near the village, {{conducted}} burial services at Noraduz; {{in order to}} avoid the two-hour round trip from the cemetery to the monastery he built himself a small cell in Noraduz. When he was 90 years old, he asked his brother monks to bury him alive. His last words were: [...] "I do not fear death. I would like you to not be afraid also. Never fear anything, but God alone. Let anyone who has fear come to me. Pour water at the burial stone, drink the water, <b>wash</b> <b>your</b> face, chest, arms and legs. Then break the vessel that contained the water.
