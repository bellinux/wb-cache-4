500|$|In {{conversation}} with Woods, Biko {{insisted that the}} BCM would not degenerate into anti-white racism [...] "because it isn't a negative, hating thing. It's a positive black self-confidence thing involving no hatred of anyone". He acknowledged that a [...] "fringe element" [...] may retain [...] "anti-white bitterness"; he added: [...] "we'll do <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> restrain that, but frankly it's not one of our top priorities or one of our major concerns. Our main concern is the liberation of the blacks." [...] Elsewhere, Biko {{argued that it was}} the responsibility of a vanguard movement to ensure that, in a post-apartheid society, the black majority would not seek vengeance upon the white minority. He stated that this would require an education of the black population in order to teach them how to live in a non-racial society.|$|E
500|$|On 31 July 2009, Digital Spy {{conducted}} a poll asking {{if it was}} [...] "time to move on" [...] from Ianto. However, a week later the website did not immediately publish the results, announcing [...] "unfortunately it seems that this particular Poll {{was the subject of}} a campaign by diehard fans to distort the outcome". Neil Wilkes opined that this action by the fans [...] "suggests the answer to the question 'Have people overreacted to Ianto's death?' is quite obvious". Later, a footnote amendment noted that 31.4% said it was time to move on, [...] "while the remainder demanded RTD's head on a plate", a reference to his own wording of the original poll, which gave readers the option of moving on from Ianto, or the executive producer's head on a plate. James McCarthy of Wales Online described the reaction from some fans as [...] "sickening" [...] and quoted [...] "crazed" [...] fans on DeviantArt and Facebook who made explicit death threats against the Children of Earth writers. Gareth David-Lloyd stated he was very disappointed in those fans, whose message board conduct he does not support at all and called [...] "completely unacceptable". David-Lloyd added that he [...] "would hope the writers would be able to ignore comments like that". A number of fans were upset by the tone of the first Wales Online article, and their response prompted a follow up from McCarthy. In their comments, fans pointed out that his article disproportionately highlights what they called the [...] "ill-conceived, knee-jerk reactions" [...] of a few individuals, and stressed that these reactions in no way represent the movement to bring Ianto Jones back, which they hold as fundamentally respectful towards the show's actors and writers. Fans have distanced themselves from the small minority of extremists, and have been keen to stress their peaceful activism, described as [...] "thousands of fans who are raising money for charity, sending polite letters, and doing <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> be supportive of the character and actor". In 2010, Doctor Who executive producer Steven Moffat told fans who contacted him that he wouldn't want to resurrect Ianto even if he could: [...] "Not reversing it. Stop asking." [...] In a 2011 poll published by the Liverpool Daily Post as part of a live Interview with writer John Fay, 70% of respondents replied that the decision to kill Ianto had been the right one, with 19% responding [...] "indifferent" [...] and only 11% stating that it had been the wrong decision, contrasting with the initial fan response. In response to a question, Fay also stated that he had not been affected by the [...] "scary" [...] fan reaction, maintaining that [...] "a universe in which fictional characters aren't 'allowed' to die is ridiculous and limiting".|$|E

2500|$|Peter Hitchens {{argued that}} Pullman pursues an anti-Christian agenda, citing an {{interview}} in which Pullman is quoted as saying: [...] "I'm trying to undermine the basis of Christian belief." [...] In the same interview, Pullman acknowledges that a controversy {{would be likely to}} boost sales, but continues [...] "I'm {{not in the business of}} offending people. I find the books upholding certain values that I think are important, such as life is immensely valuable and this world is an extraordinarily beautiful place. We should do <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>to</b> increase the amount of wisdom in the world." [...] Hitchens also views the His Dark Materials series as a direct rebuttal of C. S. Lewis's The Chronicles of Narnia; Pullman has criticised the Narnia books as religious propaganda. Hitchens' brother Christopher Hitchens, author of God Is Not Great, praised His Dark Materials as a fresh alternative to Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien and J. K. Rowling, describing the author as one [...] "whose books have begun to dissolve the frontier between adult and juvenile fiction". However, he was more critical of The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ, accusing Pullman of being a [...] "Protestant atheist" [...] for supporting the teachings of Christ but being critical of organised religion.|$|E
