5|$|<b>When</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> people, The New York Times {{generally}} uses honorifics, {{rather than}} unadorned last names (except {{in the sports}} pages, Book Review and Magazine).|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> the language, {{the name}} is {{normally}} capitalized (Perl) as a proper noun. <b>When</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> the interpreter program itself, {{the name is}} often uncapitalized (perl) because most Unix-like file systems are case-sensitive. Before {{the release of the}} first edition of Programming Perl, it was common to refer to the language as perl; Randal L. Schwartz, however, capitalized the language's name in the book to make it stand out better when typeset. This case distinction was subsequently documented as canonical.|$|E
5|$|Adding to the {{confusion}} is the tendency of units (again for historical reasons) to misuse titles for larger administrative structures. Although the Royal Artillery consists of 13 Regular regiments (equivalent to infantry battalions), it calls itself the Royal Regiment of Artillery <b>when</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> the units as a whole. The Royal Logistic Corps and Intelligence Corps are not corps-sized, but consist of several battalions or regiments.|$|E

5|$|Species {{boundaries}} in plants may be weaker than in animals, and cross species hybrids are often possible. A familiar example is peppermint, Mentha × piperita, a sterile hybrid between Mentha aquatica and spearmint, Mentha spicata. The many cultivated varieties of wheat {{are the result}} of multiple inter- and intra-specific crosses between wild species and their hybrids. Angiosperms with monoecious flowers often have self-incompatibility mechanisms that operate between the pollen and stigma so that the pollen either fails to reach the stigma or fails to germinate and produce male gametes. This is one of several methods used by plants to promote outcrossing. In many land plants the male and female gametes are produced by separate individuals. These species are said to be dioecious <b>when</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> vascular plant sporophytes and dioicous <b>when</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> bryophyte gametophytes.|$|E
5|$|Surface tension has the {{dimension}} of force per unit length, or of energy per unit area. The two are equivalent, but <b>when</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> energy per unit of area, {{it is common to}} use the term surface energy, which is a more general term {{in the sense that it}} applies also to solids.|$|E
5|$|The {{descriptor}} hydrated or anhydrous is used <b>when</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> iron(III) chloride, {{to distinguish}} between the two common forms. The hexahydrate is usually given as the simplified empirical formula FeCl3⋅6H2O. It may also be given as trans-Cl⋅2H2O and the systematic name tetraaquadichloroiron(III) chloride dihydrate, which more clearly represents its structure.|$|E
30|$|From Table  5, {{the yearly}} energy {{demand for the}} envelope, when ε =  0.6, is equal to 4, 583 kWh and <b>when</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> the unit surface becomes 69.6 kWhm− 2 per year. Similarly, the energy demand, when ε =  0.8, is equal to 4, 353 kWh and <b>when</b> <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> the unit surface becomes 66.1 kWhm− 2 per year.|$|R

5|$|<b>When</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> cannon, {{the term}} gun {{is often used}} incorrectly. In {{military}} usage, a gun is a cannon with a high muzzle velocity and a flat trajectory, useful for hitting the sides of targets such as walls, as opposed to howitzers or mortars, which have lower muzzle velocities, and fire indirectly, lobbing shells up and over obstacles to hit the target from above.|$|E
5|$|<b>When</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> cannon, {{the term}} gun {{is often used}} incorrectly. In {{military}} usage, a gun is a cannon with a high muzzle velocity and comparatively flat trajectory, as opposed to other types of artillery, such as howitzers or mortars, which have lower muzzle velocities, and usually fire indirectly.|$|E
5|$|Critics {{argue that}} {{theories}} of constraints {{focus on how}} children learn nouns, but ignore other aspects of their word learning. Although constraints are useful in explaining how children limit possible meanings when learning novel words, the same constraints would eventually need to be overridden {{because they are not}} utilized in adult language. For instance, adult speakers often use several terms, each term meaning something slightly different, <b>when</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> one entity, such as a family pet. This practice would violate the mutual exclusivity constraint.|$|E
50|$|With {{the fall}} of Joseon, the {{position}} of 'Sang-gam(상감)'. Along with {{the change in the}} meaning of these positions, Korean patriarchal perspectives were added to the usages of young-gam, which became a common designation; 1. <b>When</b> judges <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> each other 2. When others who are not judges <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> judges 3. <b>When</b> people <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> the mayor 4. <b>When</b> people <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> their elders 5. <b>When</b> women <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> their husbands. After the Joseon dynastys, the use of yeong-gam continued in Japan and Colonial Korea as an honorific for the position of country governor, judge, prosecutor, and district attorney.|$|R

5|$|From the Qin dynasty (221–206 BC) {{until the}} Qing dynasty (1644–1912), the ruling {{head of state}} was known as huangdi, or emperor. In Chinese {{historical}} texts, emperors of the Song dynasty, along with the Tang and Yuan dynasties, are referred to by their temple names. Before the Tang dynasty (618–907), emperors were generally referred to in historical texts by their posthumous names. During the Ming (1368–1644) and Qing dynasties, emperors were exclusively referred to in historical texts by their single era name, whereas emperors of previous dynasties, including the Song, usually had multiple era names. The amount of written characters used in posthumous names grew steadily larger from the Han dynasty (202 BC – AD 220) onwards and thus became overly long <b>when</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> sovereigns. For example, the posthumous name of Nurhaci (r. 1616–1626), {{the founder of the}} Manchu state which would eventually establish the Qing dynasty, contained 29 written characters. By the Tang dynasty, much shorter temple names were preferred <b>when</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> the emperor, a preference that was carried into the Song dynasty. Each emperor also had a tomb name (陵號; linghao) and various other honorific titles.|$|E
5|$|L: The film {{received}} its 1969 nomination {{under the title}} My Night with Maud. It had no US distributor at the time. When it was released in Los Angeles on April 15, 1970, it became eligible for consideration for Academy Awards in other categories, and received a 1970 nomination for Writing under the title My Night at Maud's. Today, the latter title is {{the most commonly used}} <b>when</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> the film in the English-speaking world.|$|E
5|$|The Protocol of Corfu {{is often}} {{mentioned}} by Northern Epirote {{and human rights}} organizations <b>when</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> the discrimination against the Greek minority in Albania. On the other hand, in Albanian historiography this agreement is scarcely mentioned or its interpretation is often grounded on different positions: {{it is seen as}} an attempt to divide the Albanian state and as a proof of the Great Powers' disregard for the national integrity of Albania.|$|E

5|$|The Romanians' ethnogenesis {{cannot be}} {{understood}} based exclusively on written sources, because the earliest records on their ancestors {{were made by}} 11th-century Byzantine historians. <b>When</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> the Romance-speaking population of Southeastern Europe, early medieval sources used the Vlach exonym or its cognates, which all derived from the Common Slavic term for speakers of the Latin language. The earliest sources write of the Vlachs of the central territories of the Balkan Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|The {{army was}} well {{organised}} {{and this was}} the reason for PulakeshinII's success beyond the Vindyas. It consisted of an infantry, a cavalry, an elephant corps and a powerful navy. The Chinese traveller Hiuen-Tsiang wrote that the Chalukyan army had hundreds of elephants which were intoxicated with liquor prior to battle. It was with their navy that they conquered Revatidvipa (Goa), and Puri on east coast of India. Rashtrakuta inscriptions use the term Karnatabala <b>when</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> the powerful Chalukya armies.|$|E
5|$|The {{denominations}} in the Latter Day Saint {{movement are}} sometimes collectively {{referred to as}} Mormonism. Although some denominations opposed {{the use of this}} term because they consider it to be derogatory, it is especially used <b>when</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> the largest Latter Day Saint group, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), and offshoots of it. Denominations opposed {{to the use of the}} term consider it to be connected to the polygamy once practiced by the Utah church.|$|E

5|$|During the Second Sino-Japanese War, many Chinese {{seaports}} {{were either}} captured or blockaded by the Japanese, {{in an attempt}} to prevent supplies from entering China. As a result, an alternative overland road named Burma Road, became China's most important supply route. Completed in 1938, supplies were sent by sea to the port in Rangoon, Burma, transported overland by rail to Lashio and through the Burma Road to Kunming in China. Due to lack of experienced drivers and mechanics in China, the Chinese government requested Tan Kah Kee, the Chairman of the China Relief Fund, to recruit volunteers from Nanyang (a term used by the Chinese <b>when</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> Southeast Asia). Following the request, the China Relief Fund published the first recruitment notice on 7 February 1939.|$|E
5|$|From the Shang to Sui (581–618 AD) dynasties, Chinese rulers (both {{kings and}} emperors) were {{referred}} to by their posthumous names in records and historical texts. Temple names, first used {{during the reign of}} Emperor Jing of Han (r. 157–141 BC), were used exclusively in later records and historical texts <b>when</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> emperors who reigned during the Tang (618–907 AD), Song (9601279 AD), and Yuan (1271–1368 AD) dynasties. During the Ming (1368–1644 AD) and Qing (1644–1911 AD) dynasties, a single era name was used for each emperor's reign and became the preferred way to refer to Ming and Qing emperors in historical texts.|$|E
5|$|In Scandinavian folklore, {{a diverse}} array of human-like supernatural beings are attested which might {{be thought of as}} elves and which might partly {{originate}} in medieval Scandinavian beliefs. However, the characteristics and names of these beings has varied widely across time and space, and they cannot be neatly categorised. These beings are sometimes known by words descended directly from Old Norse álfr. However, in the modern languages, these traditional terms have tended to be replaced with other terms. Things are further {{complicated by the fact that}} <b>when</b> <b>referring</b> <b>to</b> the elves of Old Norse mythology, scholars have adopted new forms based directly on the Old Norse word álfr. The following table summarises the situation in the main modern standard languages of Scandinavia.|$|E
