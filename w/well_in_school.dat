His humor and style began to reveal themselves during this time: Benchley was {{often called upon to}} entertain his fraternity brothers, and his impressions of classmates and professors became very popular. His performances gave him some local fame, and most entertainment programs on campus and many off-campus meetings recruited Benchley's talents.|$|E

In her anger, Chanda breaks her promise and returns to school, performing even better than before, much to Apu's chagrin. After allotting more time to school, Chanda loses one of her four jobs and begins to work at a restaurant because Amar recommends the job.|$|E

5|$|Born in Dallas, Texas, to Noel and Freida Bosh, Chris Bosh {{grew up in}} Hutchins, Texas. A family-oriented person, Bosh often played {{basketball}} {{in the house with}} his younger brother, Joel. By four years of age, he began learning how to dribble a basketball in the gym, where his dad played pick-up games. Although Bosh was always tall since youth and this allowed him to out-rebound others in basketball games, he only started learning the game around fourth grade at a playground near his grandmother's house. Apart from basketball, Bosh also played baseball up until high school, preferring to play as a first baseman. Growing up, Bosh names his parents as the biggest influences on his personality and considered NBA superstar Kevin Garnett as his favorite athlete, modeling his play after him. Academically, Bosh always did <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>school,</b> but he began to garner significant attention from college recruiters when he led Lincoln High School in Dallas to the number one ranking in the country and the USA Today National Championship with a perfect 40–0 season.|$|E

When you're black, {{you have to deal with}} so much crap in your life from other black people. It's a dirty, dark secret; I'm glad it's coming out. One of the reasons we're {{never going to be}} successful as a whole, because of other black people. And for some reason we are brainwashed to think, if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not a good black person. And it's a dirty, dark secret. There are a lot of black people who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock a successful black person down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>school,</b> and they're successful... We're the only ethnic group who say, 'Hey, if you go to jail, it gives you street cred.' It's just typical BS that goes on when you're black, man.|$|E

25|$|Among some {{immigrant}} groups, {{especially those}} who come from origin countries in which education is not free or widely available, first-generation immigrants may have had little formal schooling. Immigrant parents tend to have lower levels of formal schooling than U.S.-born parents. Low levels of education among parents can {{have a negative impact}} on their children's ability to succeed in school. On the other hand, the effort that these immigrant parents put into trying to help their children do <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>school</b> can have a significant impact on the academic achievement of students. Parents thus have some measure of control over the likelihood that their children will succeed in school. If children perceive their parents as supportive, they will be more likely to do well in their academic endeavors, regardless of the practical help their parents are actually able to provide. If parents are not invested in their children's success in school—or if they create barriers to children's education by asking children to work rather than attend school—this lack of emotional support can {{have a negative impact on}} children's likelihood of educational success.|$|E
25|$|These divides {{can also}} occur {{between members of}} the same generation, {{particularly}} between older siblings who may identify more strongly with their home country and younger siblings who may identify more with American culture. This is especially likely to occur when older siblings belong to the 1.5 generation, meaning that they were born abroad, and younger siblings were born in the United States. In many societies, older siblings are given greater responsibilities and may feel more pressure from parents to set a good example for their younger siblings by performing <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>school</b> and obtaining success. At the same time, this greater responsibility often affords older siblings a greater degree of power within the family. Older siblings may therefore also be more likely to uphold their parents' traditional values because of the power it affords them within the family. In America's more egalitarian culture, power hierarchies based on age {{are less likely to be}} accepted. Younger siblings may therefore reject the authority of their older siblings, fostering tensions within the family. The migration process can therefore destabilize traditional power hierarchies within the family based on age and in some cases may lead to a reversal of such hierarchies. Regardless of whether tension exists among members of different generations or {{members of the same}} generation, degree of assimilation may pave the way for divisions within the family.|$|E

500|$|Clarence did <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>school,</b> {{and upon}} his {{graduation}} from Waltham High School in 1903, {{he took the}} entrance examinations for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He passed, and after taking basic courses at the school, did advanced work in engineering. During the summers, he worked for J.B. Worcester & Co., a firm which had constructed much of the Boston subway system. While at school, he became a favourite pupil of Professor George Swain; after Howe graduated in 1907, Swain offered Howe a job as his teaching assistant. Howe accepted, although the young engineer felt that he should leave the Boston area to begin his career. Soon afterwards, Howe was offered an opportunity to become an engineering professor at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. A popular story about Howe was that Swain had Howe and fellow engineer James Barker toss a coin to see who would get the job. Barker denied the tale later in life, stating he {{had no interest in}} the position and no one who knew Howe would be foolish enough to gamble with him, as Howe had shown himself to be uncommonly lucky. [...] In any event, Howe had no better prospects in sight; unemployment among his classmates was high due to the Panic of 1907.|$|E
500|$|After {{attending}} USC School of Cinematic Arts {{and working}} at a youth center in South Los Angeles, Atchison incorporated his experiences from the neighborhood into the film; among them, he heard that children who do <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>school</b> {{are said to be}} [...] "acting white". As a result, Atchison tried to use the film to show what causes these children to doubt their own abilities. This doubts are shown through the preconceptions Akeelah and other community members have that [...] "Spelling Bee is for someone else". She [...] "must first overcome her feelings of inadequacy," [...] and when she discovers Larabee comes from her neighborhood and is a successful man, it [...] "empowers her to ... accomplish this task." [...] Fishburne stated the film's treatment of race extends beyond the dichotomy of struggle and success, and goes into the prejudice that many people hold against black people competing in mainstream society. Atchison elaborated, [...] "it's about this girl's insecurity about doing a thing that she hasn't seen people who look like her doing". The director affirmed that African American children in film usually aspire to nothing other than being successful in sports, music or dance. He argued that the film industry has disseminated [...] "lies about black inferiority", so he was interested in focusing in their intellect rather than let them succumb to the stereotypes. Atchison noted he had created the project for all publics [...] "but particularly for kids of color to see a little black girl who does something powerful." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{comparison}} to Cliff, Clair {{is usually the}} tougher and more sensible parent, offering her children legitimate advice that they can actually apply to their everyday lives; it remains clear to audiences that Clair runs the household. AskMen's Geoffrey Lansdell agreed that the character [...] "rel on a sly maternal quality that fed off of Bill Cosby’s silly paternal playfulness". However, there are occasionally times when Clair resorts to the [...] "wait till your father gets home" [...] method of disciplining her children. Clair generally supports her children's decisions and ever-changing ambitions, specifically in regards to schooling, marriage and careers. Both Clair and Cliff value the importance of proper education in their children's lives, appearing proudest when they do <b>well</b> <b>in</b> <b>school</b> and delivering the most serious punishments when they underperform academically. On one occasion, Theo rebels against his parents' high expectations of him, arguing, [...] "Because of what you two have achieved, the whole world expects a lot more from us than other kids. Let’s face it, there’s nowhere else left {{for us to go}} but down," [...] a statement Clair immediately reprimands him for making. When it comes to parenting, Clair usually maintains [...] "an allure of cool, calm confidence ... exhibit a strong but gentle parenting stance, one that wasn’t seen on television by a woman of color" [...] at the time, according to Global Grind's Desire Thompson. Clair practices disciplining her children without ever punishing them physically, often delivering punishments [...] "with a calm charm", and raises her four daughters to love and respect themselves. However, she is also known for ranting at her children when she loses her temper, one of her most recognizable of which is the one she gives Vanessa when she attends a concert in Baltimore against her parents' wishes. In the Season 3 episode [...] "The Shower", Denise hosts a wedding shower for a close friend who gets pregnant on purpose to blackmail her parents into letting her marry her fiancé as soon as possible. When Denise broaches the subject of how she would handle a similar situation, Clair sternly – but rather comically – insists that she will never find herself in a similar situation. Despite her seriousness and disciplinarian status, Clair seldom shies away from laughing and participating in fun activities alongside her family as opposed to simply observing them from the sidelines. The character is also fond of relaxing and taking time to herself away from her children whenever necessary.|$|E
