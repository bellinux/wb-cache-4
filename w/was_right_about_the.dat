5|$|Steinbeck <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> lack {{of popular}} appeal, however: the unusual mixture of taxonomic data and travelogue meant the book {{struggled}} to find an audience. Few copies were printed and it was soon all but forgotten. The country's entry into the war and plummeting book sales also had an effect. Ricketts' share of the revenues from sales did not even provide him with {{the money to pay}} back Steinbeck for financing the journey.|$|E
25|$|As Secretary of the Air Force, Douglas helped {{establish}} the United States Air Force Academy. He authorized the Air Force Commendation Medal {{to replace the}} Army version of the award. Douglas advised the President regarding {{a course of action}} in response to The Soviet Union’s launch of Sputnik I in October 1957. He also reaffirmed the 1925 court-martial verdict against air power advocate Brigadier General Billy Mitchell. He said the court was correct to have been found Mitchell guilty of publicly attacking his superiors, but noted that time had proved Mitchell <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> unique value of air power.|$|E
500|$|Herodotus thus claimed (circa 440 BC) that Nile {{crocodiles}} {{had what}} {{would now be}} called a cleaning symbiosis with the bird he called the trochilus, possibly a sandpiper; but while he <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> existence of cleaning symbioses, {{there is little evidence}} for it in crocodiles. In 1906 Henry Scherren quoted John Mason Cook, son of travel agent Thomas Cook, as reporting from Egypt that he had seen some spur-winged plovers approach a crocodile, which opened its jaws for them: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Orme, [...] "he {{came here}} to murder me--you <b>were</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> risk, after all--but what I wonder is, who sent him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Word for word," [...] said Gilbert, [...] "it was this: 'My dear Miss Warren--You <b>were</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> flower. It <b>was</b> a hydrangea, {{and not a}} lilac.'" ...|$|R
50|$|He also wonders, if Amalak <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{existence}} of a real Kryptonian city full of other survivors, and whether {{a new generation of}} Kryptonians might be out there.|$|R
500|$|In 1830–1833, Charles Lyell, in his Principles of Geology, {{carefully}} summarised Lamarck's theory (in about 6 pages, with cross-references to the Philosophie Zoologique) {{and then}} roundly criticised it. Lyell begins {{by noting that}} Lamarck gives no examples {{at all of the}} development of any entirely new function ("the substitution of some entirely new sense, faculty, or organ") but only proves that the [...] "dimensions and strength" [...] of some parts can be increased or decreased. Lyell says that with this [...] "disregard to the strict rules of induction" [...] Lamarck [...] "resorts to fictions". Lyell goes on, assuming {{for the sake of argument}} that Lamarck <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> creation of new organs, that Lamarck's theory would mean that instead of the nature and form of an animal giving rise to its behaviour, its behaviour would determine ...|$|E
2500|$|... "News from Bessarabia is even sadder. Unfortunately I <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{so-called}} , {{as some of}} {{its leaders}} there seem to have converted to Bolshevism and {{were among the first}} to welcome Soviet troops with red flags and flowers." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lambert {{executive}} produced Alan Bleasdale's hard-hitting drama serial G.B.H. (1991) {{commissioned by}} Channel 4 which won several awards. Her relationship with Bleasdale {{was not entirely}} smooth, however — the writer has admitted in subsequent interviews that he [...] "wanted to kill Verity Lambert" [...] after she insisted on the cutting of large portions of his first draft script before production began. However, Bleasdale subsequently admitted that she <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> majority of the cut material, and when the production was finished he only missed one small scene from those she had demanded be excised.|$|E
60|$|Maggie {{began to}} think that Tom must <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> gipsies: they must {{certainly}} be thieves, unless the man meant to return her thimble by-and-by. All thieves, except Robin Hood, were wicked people.|$|R
60|$|MARTELLUS. Yes: I {{have been}} through all that. But you {{yourself}} are making statues of ancients instead of beautiful nymphs and swains. And Ecrasia <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> ancients being inartistic. They are damnably inartistic.|$|R
60|$|Uncle Fact was {{so angry}} and talked so loud, that Fancy felt frightened and bewildered; and began to think he might <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> mermaid part, though she hated {{to give up the}} little romance.|$|R
2500|$|Bow won {{an evening}} gown {{and a silver}} trophy, and the {{publisher}} committed to help her [...] "gain a role in films", but nothing happened. Bow's father told her to [...] "haunt" [...] Brewster's office (located in Brooklyn) until {{they came up with}} something. [...] "To get rid of me, or maybe they really meant to (give me) all the time and were just busy", Bow was introduced to director Christy Cabanne, who cast her in Beyond the Rainbow, produced late 1921 in New York City and released February 19, 1922. Bow did five scenes and impressed Cabanne with true theatrical tears, but was cut from the final print. [...] "I was sick to my stomach," [...] she recalled and thought her mother <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> movie business.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess I <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> rain," [...] remarked Phil, grimly, as {{the drops}} pattered unceasingly {{on the cover}} of the automobile.|$|E
60|$|But she <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> main point. Alice came, and Dan {{could see}} {{with his own}} weary eyes {{that she had not}} slept either.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Pon my oath, Goble, I {{gave you}} credit for more penetration," [...] he drawled; [...] "you may <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Scotchman, but your {{longshore}} lout has had both birth and breeding, or I know nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are wrong," [...] he declared. [...] "If I {{told them}} that, they'd expect {{something}} from me which I know I shan't get. You <b>are</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> person, though. I {{am going to}} telephone to Brightman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There we must disagree," [...] Andrew replied. [...] "If I <b>am</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> lode, you and {{the other}} {{shareholders}} will be told all you wish to know; if I am wrong, the loss will be mine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Gilbert <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{beauty of}} the beast,' he muttered. 'D'you keep it in your glove now?' he went on, and punched Conroy in the short ribs.|$|E
6000|$|... [295] It may be said, however, that Peel <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{yield of}} the income-tax, and only {{overlooked}} {{the fact that}} it would not all be collected, within the year.|$|E
60|$|John Barrow <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> snow. Less than {{quarter of}} an hour later the thick flakes began to fall. Then came a finer snow, which the wind blew around them like so much hard salt.|$|E
5000|$|Hearst to Greene: [...] "The dream {{idea for}} the American history series is splendid. It gives {{continuity}} and personal interest, {{and you can make}} more than one page of each series… You <b>are</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> importance of the artist." ...|$|R
6000|$|Austin smiled. [...] "To {{take a risk}} I'm {{responsible}} for? I think not. I went sufficiently far when I {{brought some}} of them here. Besides, it's comforting to remember you mayn't <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> thing being contagious, after all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Weel, weel, neibor, I'll no {{say that}} ye mayna be right," [...] {{answered}} the submissive Judith. [...] "I am sure ye <b>are</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> sawing and the mawing, the shearing and the leading, and what for suld ye no <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> kirkwark, too?--But concerning my oe, Reuben Butler--" ...|$|R
60|$|Dave <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> lesson Nat Poole had learned. He {{was deeply}} humiliated, {{both by the}} {{exposure}} concerning the feast and by what had been learned concerning his insane uncle, {{and for a long}} time was quite another boy.|$|E
6000|$|... "He <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> gold," [...] Monty faltered. [...] "It's {{there for}} the picking up. If only we could have got back we were rich for life. If you escape--you need never do another stroke of work {{as long as you}} live." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Why, {{they have}} left the place furnished, {{just as it was}} when Señor Cristoval first showed it to me,” said Mildred. “The mattings and {{upholstery}} must be ready to fall to pieces, by this time; but you see, Inez, I <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> secret rooms.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But if he <b>is</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> bit of land, my lord, it will {{be rather}} awkward." [...] And as he spoke, the lawyer {{examined}} the sketch of the vicarage entrance. [...] "He gives this as copied from the terrier of the parish, my lord." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{felt pretty}} safe. You see, I knew I could strike the river, if necessary. At {{the same time}} you <b>were</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> motive--in fact, there's no use in trying to hide it. I may as well confess that I'd sooner keep Gladwyne in sight." ...|$|R
60|$|He had <b>been</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> bomb, after all. It {{had been}} {{designed}} {{with knowledge of the}} other types, the David Type and the Wounded Soldier Type. And the Klaus Type. Not designed by human beings. It {{had been designed}} by one of the underground factories, apart from all human contact.|$|R
60|$|The old lumberman <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> snow, {{and some}} early flakes came sifting down {{while they were}} still at the {{boathouse}} packing the bobsled. The old lumberman showed them how to secure the load so {{that there would be no}} danger of its falling off.|$|E
6000|$|The oldest Rover boy <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> affair {{getting in}} the newspapers. The local sheets gave the {{accident}} a column or more and some city sheets took it up and made a [...] "spread" [...] of it, with pictures that were truly thrilling {{even though they were}} inaccurate.|$|E
60|$|Benson <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> wind, {{which was}} now {{sweeping}} strongly through {{the tops of the}} tall trees. Presently it came lower, and shook up the brushwood. The night birds began to fly around, uttering their shrill cries. The old scout listened to the birds with some concern.|$|E
25|$|Clavain and Felka {{learn of}} this history during {{communication}} with the Inhibitors in Galiana's head. Clavain, however, is not convinced that <b>the</b> Inhibitors <b>are</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> coming catastrophe and believes that their degrading performance may give humanity a chance for survival that other species have not had. As such, he rejects the Inhibitor requests to stand down.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are poetical," [...] said Betty, who laughed, and at {{the same}} time blushed slightly. [...] "But you <b>are</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> guide. Jonathan says 'always get a good guide,' and as guiding is his work he ought to know. But this has nothing in common with fishing, and here is my {{favorite}} place under the old sycamore." ...|$|R
60|$|Sid Todd had <b>been</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{climbing}} to <b>be</b> {{done during the}} last stage of the journey, and often the boys, as they looked ahead at the rocks before them, wondered how {{they were going to}} make progress. But the cowboy knew the trail, and up they went, the scenery every moment growing wilder and more impressive.|$|R
