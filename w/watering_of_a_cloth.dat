The main goal of the paper is to determine (based on original cloth model) parameters of probabilistic distributions used by stochastic ray tracing algorithm for implicit model <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>cloth.</b> go down with cloth hierarchy we encounter such deterministic elements as number <b>of</b> fibers in <b>a</b> yarn, fiber cross-section shape, attenuation coefficient of the yarn etc. Most significant statistical elements are fiber distributions along the yarn then we also have roughness of the fiber surface etc. This is the area where cloth analysis {{is expected to be}} enhanced by statistical approach...|$|R
