Motion equations regarding to <b>Wing-in-Ground</b> effect <b>craft</b> had to be elaborated. Model tests in towing tank and wind tunnel had to be planned, carried out and evaluated. A comprehensive test program with the manned test craft HYDROWING VT 01 had to be prepared, assisted and evaluated. The research work was started to increase Know-how on <b>Wing-in-Ground</b> effect <b>crafts,</b> and to develop theoretical methods as basis of a scientific founded design method. Experimental work and the test program was done to validate theoretical results and to investigate more complex subjects. After evaluation of model experiments some modifications of VT 01 concept were done and technical problems were solved.

40|$|AbstractPower {{augmented}} ram (PAR) {{engine is}} a popular equipment to reduce the requirement of power for takeoff and improve aerodynamic performance. To provide detailed insight into the aerodynamic characteristics of <b>wing-in-ground</b> effect (WIG) <b>craft</b> with PAR engine, numerical simulations are carried out on WIG craft models in cruise. Simplified engine models are applied to the simulations. Two cruise modes for PAR engine are considered. The aerodynamic characteristics of the WIG craft and other features are studied. Comparisons with WIG craft model without PAR show that shutoff of PAR engine results {{in an increase in}} drag and less change in lift. Accordingly for the work of PAR engine, the air flow blown from the engine accelerates the flow around the upper surface and a high-speed attached flow near the trailing edge is recorded. With the schemed PAR flow, more suction force is realized and the flow features over the wing vary noticeably. It is also shown that the Coanda effect, provided with an attached flow, introduces an appropriate and practical flow mode for WIG craft with PAR engine in cruise. The results refresh our understanding on aerodynamic characteristics of WIG craft...|$|R
40|$|Static {{stability}} is a main {{issue of a}} <b>wing-in-ground</b> effect (WIG) <b>craft</b> for safe takeoff and cruise mode of flight. In this study, the effect of ground boundary layers on aerodynamic behaviour and the height static stability of a compound wing ofWIG craft were numerically studied during ground effect. First, the principal aerodynamic coefficients of numerical analysis were validated by experimental data of the compound wing. Then, these coefficients of the compound wing were obtained for fixed and moving ground conditions. Consequently, the numerical results showed that viscous ground had some effects on lift and drag coefficients and lift-to-drag ratio, whereasmoment coefficient and centre of pressure of the compound wing had small variation due to removal of ground boundary layers. The present results clarified that the ground viscous effect can be changed slightly with Reynolds number. Also, the height static stability of the compound wing will be obtained and compared with the rectangular wing one. Based on the current results, {{the stability of the}} compound wing was higher than a common rectangular wing. In addition, the height static stability of both wings was strongly affected with ground clearance. It had slight reduction then fluctuated when Reynolds number was increased...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTo provide {{detailed}} {{insight into}} schemed power-augmented flow for <b>wing-in-ground</b> effect (WIG) <b>craft</b> {{in view of}} the concept of cruising with power assistance, this paper presents a numerical study. The engine installed before the wing for power-augmented flow is replaced by a simplified engine model in the simulations, and is considered to be equipped with a thrust vector nozzle. Flow features with different deflected nozzle angles are studied. Comparisons are made on aerodynamics to evaluate performance of power-augmented ram (PAR) modes in cruise. Considerable schemes of power-augmented flow in cruise are described. The air blown from the PAR engine accelerates the flow around wing and a high-speed attached flow near the trailing edge is recorded for certain deflected nozzle angles. This effect takes place and therefore the separation is prevented not only at the trailing edge but also on the whole upper side. The realization of suction varies with PAR modes. It is also found that scheme of blowing air under the wing for PAR engine is aerodynamically not efficient in cruise. The power-augmented flow is extremely complicated. The numerical results give clear depiction of the flow. Optimal scheme of power-augmented flow with respect to the craft in cruise depends on the specific engines and the flight regimes...|$|R
40|$|The {{configuration}} {{and service}} condition of a wing {{can influence the}} performance of <b>wing-in-ground</b> effect (WIG) <b>craft.</b> In this study, the aerodynamic performance of compound wings in ground effect was numerically investigated through a parametric design study. The compound wing {{is divided into three}} parts with one rectangular wing in the middle and two reverse taper wings with an anhedral angle at the sides. A NACA 6409 airfoil was employed as a section of the wing. The design parameters included the span size, anhedral angle, and taper ratio plus two boundary conditions: ground clearance and Reynolds number. The three-dimensional, Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations were solved numerically. A realizable k-e turbulent model was used to compute the effects of the turbulent flow over the wing surface. The computational results of the basic wing were compared with the experimental data of other published works. Next, the aerodynamic performance of the compound wings was computed for various design parameters. Accordingly, all design parameters had effects on the lift-to-drag ratio of the compound wing, although their effects were not equal. The span size of the side wing, anhedral angle, and ground clearance have substantial effects on the lift-to-drag ratio of the compound wing. Two phenomena, namely the ram effect pressure and tip vortex could affect the lift-to-drag ratio of the compound wing in different configurations and conditions...|$|R
40|$|<b>Wing-in-ground</b> effect (WIG) <b>craft</b> can be {{considered}} as a new technology for marine transportation. High speed performance of WIG craft has high advantage as compared to other marine transport designs. The performance of WIG craft depends mostly on its wing configurations. In this thesis, the aerodynamic characteristics of a new compound wing were numerically and experimentally investigated in proximity of the ground. The compound wing was divided into three parts where one rectangular wing in the middle and two reverse taper wings with anhedral angle at the sides. NACA 6409 airfoil was selected as a case study for the wing airfoil section. Three dimensional (3 D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was applied as a numerical model. The governing equations are the three-dimensional incompressible Navier–Stokes equations for continuity and momentum. Different turbulent models were used for the turbulent flow around the wing surface. For validation purpose, wind tunnel experiments were carried out, and other published experimental work were used for comparison, where the current numerical simulation result is found to have good agreement with them. The experiments carried out in Universiti Teknologi Malaysia low speed wind tunnel and the aerodynamic forces and moment were measured with a Multi-Axis Load Cell JR 3. The principal aerodynamic coefficients of compound wing and a rectangular wing such as lift coefficient, drag coefficient, lift to drag ratio wing were computed for different ground clearance and angle of attacks. It was found that at low ground clearance the aerodynamic lift and drag coefficients of compound wing resulted in increased efficiency of the wing. For optimal design of compound wing, the effect of design parameter such as the span size of the middle wing and the anhedral angle on performance of wing were investigated. For certain wings when the span of the middle part reduced, the lift to drag ratio of compound wing increased noticeably. As compared with the rectangular wing, compound wing gives lower fuel consumption. The present design of compound wing can be used to increase the ground effect advantages for new generation of WIG crafts...|$|R
