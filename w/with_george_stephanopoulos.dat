2500|$|During an {{interview}} <b>with</b> ABC News’ <b>George</b> <b>Stephanopoulos,</b> President Barack Obama praised the protesters, but cautioned against protest tactics {{that he felt}} stifled open dialogue at the University of Missouri and other campuses. He said, [...] "There is clearly a problem at the University of Missouri, and that's not just coming from students. That's coming from some faculty. And I think it is entirely appropriate for students in a thoughtful, peaceful way to protest—what they see as injustices or inattention to serious problems in their midst. I want an activist student body just like I want an activist citizenry." ...|$|R
2500|$|Romney {{got into}} a long {{discussion}} <b>with</b> moderator <b>George</b> <b>Stephanopoulos</b> over whether states {{have the right to}} ban contraception or whether that was trumped by a constitutional right to privacy. Romney said, [...] "So you're asking, given the fact that there's no state that wants to do so and I don't know of any candidate that wants to do so, you're asking could it constitutionally be done? We can ask our constitutionalist here," [...] gesturing to Ron Paul, which drew laughter and applause from the audience. The discussion continued until Romney grew frustrated at the repeated questioning and asserted, [...] "States don't want to ban contraception. So why would we try {{and put it in the}} Constitution?... Contraception, it's working just fine, just leave it alone." [...] Stephanopoulos later joked on The Colbert Report that he had a bet with fellow moderator Diane Sawyer that he could get Romney to say [...] "contraceptions are working just fine".

500|$|Following his {{endorsement}} of Clinton, Biden publicly displayed his disagreements with {{the policies of}} Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.

[...] During an interview <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>Stephanopoulos</b> at the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 26, Biden asserted that [...] "moral and centered" [...] voters would not vote for Trump.

500|$|Thompson officially {{entered the}} race on April 1, 2007 {{following}} {{the announcement that}} he would seek the Republican Party's nomination for president during an interview on This Week <b>with</b> <b>George</b> <b>Stephanopoulos.</b> He branded himself as a reliant conservative whose campaign was [...] "looking good" [...] due to the base he was attempting to establish in Iowa. The state would hold the nation's first presidential caucus in January 2008. His entrance into the race slightly increased voter's recognition of [...] "Thompson" [...] in polls but pollsters stated that this increase was most likely attributed to the exposure of potential candidate Fred Thompson. He remained at 2% in presidential polls, in sixth place overall behind potential candidates Newt Gingrich and Fred Thompson, but ahead of declared candidates Ron Paul, Jim Gilmore, Tom Tancredo, Sam Brownback, Duncan Hunter and Mike Huckabee. Statewide polls placed Thompson at 24% {{in his home state}} of Wisconsin, which was considerably higher than the marks achieved by other lower tiered candidates in their home states. [...] Upon his entrance, the candidate set forth his position on the War in Iraq, holding that as president, he would allow Iraqis to vote on whether or not the United States military should remain in the nation. He stated that if the Iraqis [...] "don't want us there...we should get out." ...|$|E

He doesn't have horns. We may disagree with him on some issues and we may wish that you know, the unemployment rate was coming down faster and we want him to know his plan on gas prices. But we're not really worrying about conspiracy theories or ... birth certificates. And so ... I think it presents a problem for them." ...|$|E
