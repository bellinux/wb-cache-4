500|$|The song's lyrics {{describe}} Timberlake's {{tunnel vision}} {{of his love}} interest, with several voyeuristic references. The singer professes his love: [...] "I look around and everything I see is beautiful, because all I see is you." [...] According to The Huffington Posts Dean, Timberlake is in happier state of mind than on his 2002 song [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] or his 2007 single [...] "What Goes Around... Comes Around". However, his lyrics have an obsessive quality: [...] "A million people in a crowded room, but my camera lens is only set to zoom and it all becomes so clear." [...] Mellisa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly wrote that on [...] "Tunnel Vision", Timberlake is lyrically [...] "playing the rom-com director": [...] "Just like a movie shoot, I’m zoomin’ in on you as <b>we</b> <b>ride</b> off into the sun." [...] According to Mikael Wood of the Los Angeles Times, Timberlake uses references to [...] "cameras and reflective surfaces" [...] {{to reflect on the}} [...] "changing nature of celebrity".|$|E
2500|$|Season six {{opened to}} much hype and curiosity. The A.V. Club asked, [...] "I'm {{guessing}} {{that one of}} the biggest fears of Lost fans as <b>we</b> <b>ride</b> out this sixth and final season—bumps and all—is that we're going to come to the end and find a big nothing in return for all we've invested in these characters. We don't just need answers, we need justifications. Why has whatever happened, happened? Who has called this particular meeting to order, and does it really matter who showed up?" [...] The episodes [...] "Dr. Linus", [...] "Ab Aeterno", [...] "Happily Ever After", and [...] "The Candidate" [...] opened to highly positive critical reception while the third-to-last episode [...] "Across the Sea" [...] was the episode with the most negative reception. The time spent at the Others' temple was criticized. E! Online described the show as [...] "lightning in a bottle" [...] and picked it as [...] "Top TV Drama of 2010." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first time}} {{songs from the}} new album were played live was on 17 August 2003 at Newport, the first gig of three {{alongside}} a Birmingham date and a Manchester date, {{in preparation for the}} Reading and Leeds festival at the end of August. For these gigs We Still Kill The Old Way became the regular opener, whilst sets closed with Burn Burn, with tracks from their previous album interspersed in between. Kerrang noted in a live review from Manchester that We Still Kill The Old Way and To Hell <b>We</b> <b>Ride</b> were [...] "well received" [...] but that [...] "the surfeit of new material leads to a comparatively muted response". At the end of July though it was announced that the band had cancelled their appearance at Reading and Leeds, whilst still promising to play the three warm-up shows, citing that they wanted the recording of Start Something to take precedence. Ian Watkins said [...] "Unfortunately these shows are at the final stages of making the record and we felt it was more important not to short change anyone." [...] The band did however support Linkin Park at Wembley Arena in London on 22 November 2003 playing eight tracks, including five from the soon to be released new album. Therefore, the band played four dates altogether in 2003.|$|E
60|$|There was no {{satisfying}} Miss Sampson with rides, new places, new faces, new adventures. And {{every time}} <b>we</b> <b>rode</b> out {{she insisted on}} first riding through Linrock; and every time <b>we</b> <b>rode</b> home she insisted on going back that way.|$|R
6000|$|Half an {{hour later}} <b>we</b> <b>rode</b> into sight of Carrington, and both instinctively drew rein; then Grace {{signified}} approval as without speaking <b>we</b> <b>rode</b> on again. Still her faint smile showed that she recognized my own feeling that <b>we</b> were <b>riding</b> boldly into the camp of the enemy. Miss Carrington met us at the entrance, and when I dismounted said to me aside: ...|$|R
60|$|Ten {{minutes later}} <b>we</b> were <b>riding</b> north again, {{and all that}} night <b>we</b> <b>rode,</b> along the endless Aemilian Way, pausing {{for no more than}} a draught of wine from time to time, and munching a loaf as <b>we</b> <b>rode.</b> <b>We</b> crossed the Po, and kept {{steadily}} on, taking fresh horses when we could, until towards sunset a turn in the road brought Pagliano into our view--grey and lichened on the crest of its smooth emerald hill.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must follow}} us quietly," [...] {{one of them}} said. [...] "For today you {{can keep up with}} us {{to the end of the}} first stage. Three fresh horses have been {{provided}} for us, for <b>we</b> <b>ride</b> without a stop to Paris. Three soldiers will there take charge of the horses <b>we</b> <b>ride.</b> When we go on you will follow quietly with the horses that you are now leading. It will be impossible for you to keep up with us." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>rode</b> on, {{crossing}} the river, and heading straight for Pagliano.|$|R

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>rode</b> slowly forward. Blind-boy {{advanced}} as slowly, with {{a dangerous}} {{motion of the}} wings.|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{lose them}} unless <b>we</b> <b>ride</b> after them," [...] said Dave; and {{a minute later}} all were in the saddle, leaving their camping outfit behind them.|$|E
6000|$|... "This {{is truly}} a change for the better, Monsieur Philip," [...] Pierre said. [...] "We entered Nerac as tillers of the soil, <b>we</b> <b>ride</b> out in knightly fashion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, we {{all take}} {{some sort of}} exercise. We walk several hours a day, or we row, or <b>we</b> <b>ride</b> a bicycle, or a horse, or we fence." ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>we</b> <b>rode,</b> bending {{low in the}} saddle, keen eyes {{alert for}} branches, {{vaulting}} the white--blanketed logs, and swerving as we split to pass the pines. The mist from the melting snow moistened our faces, and the rushing air cooled them with fresh, soft sensation. There were moments when <b>we</b> <b>rode</b> abreast and others when we sailed single file, with white ground receding, vanishing behind us.|$|R

6000|$|... "Nor me," [...] said Babbalanja. [...] "Yoomy: poets both, we differ but in seeming; thy airiest conceits are as {{the shadows}} of my deepest ponderings; though Yoomy soars, and Babbalanja dives, both meet at last. Not a song you sing, but I have thought its thought; and where dull Mardi sees but your rose, I unfold its petals, and {{disclose}} a pearl. Poets are we, Yoomy, in that we dwell without us; we live in grottoes, palms, and brooks; <b>we</b> <b>ride</b> the sea, <b>we</b> <b>ride</b> the sky; poets are omnipresent." ...|$|E

60|$|Here {{horses were}} ready and another comrade, and without delay we were away through the starlight. To the north I {{could see the}} loom of Sonoma Mountain, toward which <b>we</b> <b>rode.</b> <b>We</b> left the old town of Sonoma {{to the right and}} rode up a canyon that lay between {{outlying}} buttresses of the mountain. The wagon-road became a wood-road, the wood-road became a cow-path, and the cow-path dwindled away and ceased among the upland pastures. Straight over Sonoma Mountain <b>we</b> <b>rode.</b> It was the safest route. There was no one to mark our passing.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{are very}} much obliged to you," [...] Mr. Sabin said, [...] "but I have an {{appointment}} which is already overdue. You must not mind, Helène, if <b>we</b> <b>ride</b> {{the rest of the}} way." ...|$|E

60|$|March 28.--We {{went out}} a little ride. The weather most tempting, the day beautiful. <b>We</b> <b>rode</b> and walked a little.|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>rode</b> over Castlewood Downs {{before the}} {{breaking}} of dawn. We passed the very spot where the car was upset fourteen years since, and Mohun lay. The village was not up yet, nor the forge lighted, as <b>we</b> <b>rode</b> through it, passing by the elms, where the rooks were still roosting, and by the church, and over the bridge. We got off our horses at the bridge and {{walked up to the}} gate.|$|R
60|$|And so <b>we</b> <b>rode</b> away again, {{and through}} Valencia, and through San Josef, weary and happy, back to Port of Spain.|$|R
