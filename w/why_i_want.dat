500|$|Obama's {{goal for}} his Inaugural speech was {{to stir the}} {{following}} response among Americans: [...] "This is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to go into public service and be a better politician. This is <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> {{to go home and}} be a better parent, better worker, better citizen." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Daddy" [...] is {{a nearly}} five-minute long R song. The first verse {{of the song}} begins with Beyoncé reminiscing about the times she and her father/manager, Mathew Knowles shared {{as a child and}} through her adolescence. She sings about wanting to be with a man and a child who has similar qualities as her father. This is {{illustrated}} in the lyrics: [...] "I treasure every irreplaceable memory and that's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> my unborn son to be like my daddy, I want my husband to be like my daddy, there is no one else like my daddy." [...] According to Marc Anthony Neal of the PopMatters, Beyoncé also confidently embraces her womanhood in the song. In a way, Beyoncé pays tribute to her father through this song.|$|E
500|$|When Anders and Tyrol {{detonate}} {{the bomb}} {{at the beginning}} of the episode, one of the Number Three (D'anna) models was to film a propaganda film in front of Laura Roslin's (Mary McDonnell) school at the time, but that was cut. Also, Jammer (Dominic Zamprogna) was originally considered the suicide bomber at the end, but was changed to Duck because he had less to live for after his wife's death. In the original drafts, the resistance was not planning suicide bombings, but [...] "freaking the Cylons out" [...] by imprisoning many of them in a secret underground prison, torture them for information, and leave them alive instead of killing them, as they would resurrect otherwise. This would make the Cylons worry about their missing comrades. However, Moore later realized that suicide bombings would be [...] "really potent and really powerful." [...] When writing the scenes involving Duck leading to the suicide bombing, Moore got [...] "emotionally caught up in it," [...] adding [...] "as I was writing these scenes of him standing in the police ranks, we know he's got the belt on. What's he gonna do? And then, oh my God, he actually does it. I mean, it's really horrifying stuff. But it's true. That's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to do it. It really happens. People do this." [...] The producers were initially worried that the Sci Fi Channel would not allow the inclusion of the bombing scene, but to Moore's surprise, Sci Fi executive Mark Stern did not object to it.|$|E

6000|$|... "Of course I was," [...] replied Tommy, resenting his {{surprise}} at a thing so obvious; and [...] "That's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> him to come," [...] chimed in Grizel.|$|R
2500|$|Later {{during the}} 1980s, Rather gained further renown for his {{forceful}} and skeptical {{reporting on the}} Iran-Contra affair, which eventually led to an on-air confrontation with then Vice President George H. W. Bush: Bush referred to Rather's [...] "dead air incident" [...] saying, [...] "I {{want to talk about}} <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to be President, why those 41 percent of the people are supporting me. And I don't think it's fair to judge my whole career by a rehash on Iran. How would you like it if I judged your career by those seven minutes when you walked off the set in New York?" [...] Rather ignored Bush's comment.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2007, a {{resolution}} was approved in the House of Representatives opposing President George W. Bush's plan to increase troop levels in Iraq. Bachmann voted [...] "No". However, before supporting the proposed surge, Bachmann {{called for a}} full hearing, saying, [...] "The American people deserve to hear and understand the merits of increasing U.S. troop presence in Iraq. Increased troop presence is justifiable if that measure would bring a swift conclusion to a difficult conflict." [...] She hesitated to give a firm endorsement, calling the hearings [...] "a good first step in explaining to the American people the course toward victory in Iraq". When pressed, {{she said she had}} not come to any conclusion on the matter, saying, [...] "I don't believe we have all of the information in front of us. As a member of Congress that's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to go to Iraq as quickly as I can. I want to get the best information in front of me." ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Brook {{had turned}} to Mitchy. [...] "I {{just wanted you to}} know. So I spoke. It's not more {{complicated}} than that. As for <b>WHY</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> you to know--!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'O Mrs. Jethway, you {{do think}} so mistakenly! I liked him best--that's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> {{him to do}} it. He was gentle and nice--I always thought him so--and I liked him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, that IS a question, I must say; {{and just}} like women! <b>Why,</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> the ADVENTURE of it; and I'd a waded neck-deep in blood to --goodness alive, AUNT POLLY!" ...|$|R
6000|$|His {{companion}} faltered but an instant. [...] "Ah that's {{another thing}} I know. But it's also exactly why. <b>Why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> Nanda away." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There is this absurd {{craving for}} Mr. Capes--the 'Capes crave,' {{they would call}} it in America. <b>Why</b> do <b>I</b> <b>want</b> him so badly? <b>Why</b> do <b>I</b> <b>want</b> him, and think about him, and fail {{to get away from}} him? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now {{you know}} <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> {{you to learn}} to cross a bridge; it's a very nice way {{of getting rid of}} dogs," [...] said Granny Fox, as she climbed up beside Reddy.|$|R
6000|$|... "He's too small," [...] {{declared}} Hal. [...] "That's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> you to help. Then {{my conscience}} {{would be only}} half guilty. I'm {{going to let him}} off this time with just a snowball." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's all right, Shorty," [...] Wild Water forgave him. [...] "But let's {{get down}} to business. You see <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> them eggs. I want 'em bad." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, my dear Mr. Wilkinson," [...] {{said the}} doctor, as if delighted at a coincidence; [...] "and Mr. Turnbull, too. <b>Why,</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> {{to speak to}} Mr. Turnbull." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's exactly <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to do {{something}} about Ogden. If he's allowed to go on as he is at present, he will grow up exactly like Jimmy Crocker." ...|$|E

60|$|So I {{told them}} about my journey. They were puzzled. They did not quite {{understand}} <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to walk. But they were delighted {{with the idea of}} going to Lugano and Como and then to Milan.|$|R
6000|$|... "True?" [...] laughed Lane, grimly. [...] "Yes, it's true.... I won't last long, Pepper, {{according}} to Doctor Bronson. That's <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> {{to make hay}} while the sun shines." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{precisely}} <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> you to stop. And her cousin, almost her brother: what an {{idea that}} it won't do! Haven't you stayed here before when {{there has been no}} one?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'That {{is exactly}} <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> you to come. The {{idea is to}} take no notice {{of the events of}} yesterday, and that we should all go about as if nothing had happened.' ...|$|E
5000|$|... "My father," [...] wrote Childs, [...] "was {{a lawyer}} and {{his father was a}} farmer, as his forebears {{apparently}} had been since the time of Adam. <b>Why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted,</b> from the age of thirteen or fourteen, to be a newspaperman I've never quite understood." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, {{that was}} what I always said! That was <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> you so to marry this season! Why did not you take Chalkclere, or half-a-dozen good matches who were dying for you, and not this confounded black parson, of all birds in the air?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes.... <b>I</b> {{told you}} <b>why</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> you to know.... And now forget that--and when I'm gone--if {{you think of}} me ever, let it be about how much better it made me--to have all this good luck--to help your father and to save you!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I own {{the next}} ranch, that's <b>why.</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> {{to turn my}} cattle an' sech in the two. Besides that, it ain't natural {{for a man to}} stand by an' see others a-usin' of his things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What do I want?" [...] {{repeated}} the merchant, looking behind {{him to make}} sure that Booth had not followed him. [...] "What do I want? <b>Why,</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to help you, Strong, that's what I want." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "'Don't ye know Jimmy Clancy?' says I. 'Ye pink-gilled monster.'
