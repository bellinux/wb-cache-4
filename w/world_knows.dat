25|$|One of Taiwan's halal {{certification}} body is the Taiwan Halal Integrity Development Association, inaugurated in May 2011 in Taipei, obtained the membership to a cross-border halal food certification program which {{is governed by}} the authorities from Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. The association is based in Taipei Cultural Mosque. Another type of Halal certification, the 'Muslim Friendly Restaurant' certification, is handled by the Chinese Muslim Association. The purpose of the certification, except to certify the Halal-ness of the food, is to let the <b>world</b> <b>knows</b> that there are Muslims in Taiwan too. The certification guidelines specify method, source, items, dos and donts in hosting Muslim customers according to their customs in dining in restaurants. The methods specified by the certification guidelines may make the cost of hosting Muslim travelers more costly, but it helps to attract more Muslim tourist visitors to Taiwan.|$|E

[...] Other leaflets sought to encourage desertions by highlighting the material benefits enjoyed by defectors to the West.

Border troops were said to be avid readers, despite risking severe punishment if they were caught even picking up propaganda leaflets.

2500|$|In April the Spanish ambassador, Bernardino de Mendoza, {{wrote to}} King Philip II of Spain {{that it had}} been {{proposed}} that if Anjou were to travel to England to negotiate his marriage to the Queen, De Vere, Surrey and Windsor should be hostages for his safe return. Anjou himself did not arrive in England until the end of August, but his ambassadors were already in England. De Vere was sympathetic to the proposed marriage, Leicester and his nephew Philip Sidney were adamantly opposed to it. This antagonism may have triggered the famous quarrel between De Vere and Sidney on the tennis court at Whitehall. It is not entirely clear who was playing on the court when the fight erupted; what is undisputed is that De Vere called Sidney a 'puppy', while Sidney responded that [...] "all the <b>world</b> <b>knows</b> puppies are gotten by dogs, and children by men". The French ambassadors, whose private galleries overlooked the tennis court, were witness to the display. Whether it was Sidney who next challenged De Vere to a duel or the other way around, De Vere did not take it further, and the Queen personally took Sidney to task for not recognizing the difference between his status and De Vere's. Christopher Hatton and Sidney's friend Hubert Languet also tried to dissuade Sidney from pursuing the matter, and it was eventually dropped. The specific cause is not known, but in January 1580 De Vere wrote and challenged Sidney; {{by the end of the}} month De Vere was confined to his chambers, and was not released until early February.|$|E
2500|$|While Paris {{during the}} Restoration had many {{beautiful}} monuments and majestic squares, the neighborhoods {{of the city}} between the monuments were dark, crowded and crumbling. [...] An English traveler who visited Paris in 1814, {{at the very beginning}} of the Restoration, wrote: [...] "The ordinary buildings of Paris, as every traveler has observed and as all the <b>world</b> <b>knows,</b> are in general mean and uncomfortable. The height and gloomy aspect of the houses; the narrowness of the streets, and the want of pavement for foot passengers, convey an idea of antiquity, which ill accords with what the imagination had anticipated of the modern capital of the French Empire." [...] Upper class Parisians began moving to new residential neighborhoods that were created in the north and west; the Quartier Francois I near the Champs-Élysées in 1823, and the quartier Saint-Vincent-de-Paul and quarter de la Europe built in the north in 1824. [...] They had wider streets, sidewalks, and houses modeled after the squares and town houses of London. [...] They also moved to some of the villages outside the edge of the city, particularly Passy, and Beaugrenelle. [...] By 1830, the village of Passy had become part of the city, a main street, rue de Passy, lined with three and four story buildings. [...] At the same time, the older neighborhoods of the city, in the center the east. and grew more crowded every year. The neighborhoods of Arcis and Saint-Avoye, in the modern third arrondissement, had a population density of eight hundred persons per hectare in 1817, [...] eight hundred fifty and 1831, and nine-hundred sixty in 1851, which amounted to nearly one hundred thousand persons per square kilometer.|$|E
