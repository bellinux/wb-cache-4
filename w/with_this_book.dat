5|$|Narayan {{moved to}} Mysore {{to live with}} his family when his father was {{transferred}} to the Maharajah's College High School. The well-stocked library at the school, as well as his father's own, fed his reading habit, and he started writing as well. After completing high school, Narayan failed the university entrance examination and spent a year at home reading and writing; he subsequently passed the examination in 1926 and joined Maharaja College of Mysore. It took Narayan four years to obtain his bachelor's degree, a year longer than usual. After being persuaded by a friend that taking a master's degree (M.A.) would kill his interest in literature, he briefly held a job as a school teacher; however, he quit in protest when the headmaster of the school asked him to substitute for the physical training master. The experience made Narayan realise that the only career for him was in writing, and he decided to stay at home and write novels. His first published work was a book review of Development of Maritime Laws of 17th-Century England. Subsequently, he started writing the occasional local interest story for English newspapers and magazines. Although the writing did not pay much (his income for the first year was nine rupees and twelve annas), he had a regular life and few needs, and his family and friends respected and supported his unorthodox choice of career. In 1930, Narayan wrote his first novel, Swami and Friends, an effort ridiculed by his uncle and rejected by a string of publishers. <b>With</b> <b>this</b> <b>book,</b> Narayan created Malgudi, a town that creatively reproduced the social sphere of the country; while it ignored the limits imposed by colonial rule, it also grew with the various socio-political changes of British and post-independence India.|$|E

In the prologue, he explains how {{he managed to get}} another story about Oz, even though it is isolated from all other worlds. He explains that a child suggested he make contact with Oz with wireless telegraphy. Glinda, using her book that records everything that happens, is able to know that someone is using a telegraph to contact Oz, so she erects a telegraph tower and has the Shaggy Man, who knows how to make a telegraph reply, tell the story contained in this book to Baum.|$|E

[...] However, he also noted that, while allegorically rich, the book sometimes does not realize the allegorical potential that the plot has to offer and that the writing [...] "described the action and little else." [...] Time magazine's review was also positive, stating that it [...] "is a chilling, bloody and thoroughly horrifying book" [...] and praising what it called the [...] "hypnotic" [...] quality of the violence. In Stephen King's review for Entertainment Weekly, he compared it to [...] "shoot-it-if-it-moves videogames {{in the lobby of}} the local eightplex; you know it's not real, but you keep plugging in quarters anyway." [...] However, he stated that there were [...] "displays of authorial laziness that kids will accept more readily than adults" [...] and that the love triangle was standard for the genre. He gave the book a B grade. Elizabeth Bird of School Library Journal praised the novel, saying it is [...] "exciting, poignant, thoughtful, and breathtaking by turns", and called it one of the best books of 2008. Booklist also gave a positive review, praising the character violence and romance involved in the book. Kirkus Reviews gave a positive review, praising the action and world-building, but pointed out that [...] "poor copyediting in the first printing will distract careful readers–a crying shame". Rick Riordan, author of the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series, claims it is the [...] "closest thing to a perfect adventure novel" [...] he has ever read.

500|$|In 2013, Palmetto Family, a {{conservative}} South Carolina group affiliated with Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council, challenged {{the inclusion of}} Fun Home as a reading selection for incoming freshmen at the College of Charleston. Palmetto Family president Oran Smith called the book [...] "pornographic". Bechdel disputed this, saying that pornography is designed to cause sexual arousal, {{which is not the}} purpose of her book. College provost George Hynd and associate provost Lynne Ford defended the choice of Fun Home, pointing out that its themes of identity are especially appropriate for college freshmen. However, seven months later, the Republican-led South Carolina House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee cut the college's funding by $52,000, the cost of the summer reading program, to punish the college for selecting Fun Home. Rep. Garry Smith, who proposed the cuts, said that in choosing Fun Home the university was [...] "promoting the gay and lesbian lifestyle". Rep. Stephen Goldfinch, another supporter of the cuts, said, [...] "This book trampled on freedom of conservatives. ... Teaching <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>book,</b> and the pictures, goes too far." [...] Bechdel called the funding cut [...] "sad and absurd" [...] and pointed out that Fun Home [...] "is after all about the toll that this sort of small-mindedness takes on people's lives." [...] The full state House of Representatives subsequently voted to retain the cuts. College of Charleston students and faculty reacted with dismay and protests to the proposed cuts, and the college's Student Government Association unanimously passed a resolution urging that the funding be restored. A coalition of ten free-speech organizations {{wrote a letter to the}} South Carolina Senate Finance Committee, urging them to restore the funds and warning them that [...] "enalising state educational institutions financially simply because members of the legislature disapprove of specific elements of the educational program is educationally unsound and constitutionally suspect". The letter was co-signed by the National Coalition Against Censorship, the ACLU of South Carolina, the American Association of University Professors, the Modern Language Association, the Association of College and Research Libraries, the American Booksellers Foundation for Free Expression, the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, the Association of American Publishers, the National Council of Teachers of English and the American Library Association. After a nearly week-long debate in which Fun Home and Bechdel were compared to slavery, Charles Manson and Adolf Hitler, the state Senate voted to restore the funding, but redirect the funds towards study of the United States Constitution and The Federalist Papers; the university was also required to provide alternate books to students who object to an assignment due to a [...] "religious, moral or cultural belief". Governor Nikki Haley approved the budget measure penalizing the university.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the turn}} of the first century, a kind of folded {{parchment}} notebook called pugillares membranei in Latin, became commonly used for writing in the Roman Empire. This term was used by both the pagan poet Martial and Christian apostle Paul the Apostle. Martial used the term with reference to gifts of literature exchanged by Romans during the festival of Saturnalia. According to T. C. Skeat, [...] "in at least three cases and probably in all, in the form of codices" [...] and he theorized that this form of notebook was invented in Rome and then [...] "must have spread rapidly to the Near East". In his discussion of one of the earliest pagan parchment codices to survive from Oxyrhynchus in Egypt, Eric Turner seems to challenge Skeat's notion when stating [...] "its mere existence is evidence that this book form had a prehistory" [...] and that [...] "early experiments <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>book</b> form may well have taken place outside of Egypt".|$|E

[...] His final volume, The Lost World, published in 1965, continued in the same style and cemented Jarrell's reputation as a poet; many critics consider it to be his best work.
