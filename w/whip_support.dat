2500|$|That shocked many present, who {{regarded}} it as divisive {{to be so}} {{explicit in}} relying on <b>whipped</b> <b>support</b> from his own party. Robert Boothby, a maverick Conservative MP and strong critic of Chamberlain, called out, [...] "Not I." ...|$|R
50|$|Coleman won {{election}} to the House of Delegates in 1871 and sat in three sessions from December 1871 to April 1873. During his service he tried {{to pass a bill}} that would prevent punishment by <b>whipping,</b> <b>supported</b> a civil rights bill, and introduced legislation that would enable all children of white fathers to attend white public schools. This last piece of legislation would have enabled children born between slaves and white male slave owners to attend white public schools, which were superior to those attended by African American children.|$|R
50|$|The {{campaign}} {{was just as}} volatile as the first, and with the Queensland Government under Premier T.J. Ryan strongly anti-conscription, Hughes decided to tour southern Queensland {{in a bid to}} <b>whip</b> up <b>support</b> for his cause.|$|R
50|$|On 19 June 2012, the Seanad {{passed a}} Fianna Fáil motion that the government's {{proposal}} {{to abolish the}} Seanad should be referred to the Convention. Three Labour senators (John Kelly, James Heffernan, and Denis Landy) defied the party <b>whip</b> to <b>support</b> the motion.|$|R
50|$|<b>Whipping</b> up <b>support</b> {{for the war}} was {{embraced by}} the press. Richard Caton Woodville's lithograph, War News From Mexico satirizes the {{reactions}} of various segments of the American population to the war. The lithograph is generally considered unfavorable to the war's apparent pro-slavery motivations.|$|R
50|$|As {{a member}} of the government, he {{supported}} proposals for foundation hospitals, top-up fees for students, Identity cards, and renewing Trident missiles. With regard to issues on which there was no <b>whip,</b> Campbell <b>supported</b> equal gay rights, legal restrictions on hunting foxes with hounds, and a partially elected House of Lords.|$|R
25|$|For the {{duration}} of the second Labour government (1929–31), 37 Labour MPs were sponsored by the ILP and they provided the left opposition to the Labour leadership. The 1930 ILP conference decided that where their policies diverged from the Labour Party their MPs should break the <b>whip</b> to <b>support</b> the ILP policy.|$|R
25|$|The {{internal}} {{politics of}} both sides {{had been willing to}} adopt extreme positions and to make use of religious symbols to <b>whip</b> up popular <b>support.</b>|$|R
50|$|During the House of Commons vote in October 2011 on a backbench {{motion for}} a bill to be {{introduced}} in the next parliamentary session to enable a referendum to be held on Britain's continued membership of the European Union, Mosley was one of 81 Conservative MPs {{who voted against the}} Government <b>Whip</b> to <b>support</b> a referendum.|$|R
50|$|In 1961 Baxter {{broke the}} <b>whip</b> to <b>support</b> a Conservative backbench {{amendment}} to restore corporal punishment for young offenders. He {{was very concerned}} at the Macmillan government's application to join the European Communities lest it damage ties with the Commonwealth, and abstained rather than support the government when it was put to the vote in August 1961.|$|R
50|$|Each party also elects a Whip, {{who works}} {{to ensure that}} the party's members vote as the party {{leadership}} desires. The current majority whip in the House of Representatives is Steve Scalise, {{who is a member of}} the Republican Party. The current minority whip is Steny Hoyer, who is a member of the Democratic Party. The <b>whip</b> is <b>supported</b> by chief deputy whips.|$|R
50|$|The Act {{was passed}} {{with the support}} of the Scottish National Party, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats and the Greens. The {{opposition}} Labour Party refused to support the legislation because the Act failed to claw back an estimated £125m windfall profit from alcohol retailers. The Labour MSP Malcolm Chisholm, the former Minister for Health and Community Care, disobeyed his party's <b>whip</b> and <b>supported</b> the government.|$|R
50|$|Once in Parliament, Brooks {{broke the}} Labour <b>whip</b> to <b>support</b> an {{amendment}} to the 1967 budget to relieve charities of Purchase Tax on goods they bought to further their objects; early the next year he supported amendments to soften the Commonwealth Immigrants Bill. He opposed the government's attempt to negotiate a settlement with Rhodesia. He also wanted all hereditary peers removed from the House of Lords, and called for a negotiated settlement to the Vietnam war.|$|R
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the season, Underwood is trying to erase all links to Russo's death. Thus, he kills Barnes by shoving her in front of an oncoming Washington Metro train, and frames her colleague and lover Lucas Goodwin (Sebastian Arcelus) for cyberterrorism. Another early task for newly promoted Underwood is finding his own replacement as House Majority <b>Whip.</b> He <b>supports</b> Jacqueline Sharp (Molly Parker), a military veteran and third-term Representative from California, although he refrains from offering public backing.|$|R
25|$|In 2005, Negroponte {{spoke at}} the World Economic Forum, in Davos. In this talk he urged {{industry}} to solve the problem, to enable a $100 laptop, which would enable constructionist learning, would revolutionize education, and would bring the world's knowledge to all children. He brought a mock-up and was described as prowling the halls and corridors of Davos to <b>whip</b> up <b>support.</b> Despite the reported skepticism of Bill Gates and others, Negroponte left Davos with committed interest from AMD, News Corp, and with strong indications of support from many other firms.|$|R
50|$|In 1904 he was {{requested}} {{to write an}} article for the Deutsche review on British naval policy. He {{had no control over}} the German translation of his article and claimed it had exaggerated his statements, but the article expressed a British interpretation of the threat implied by German naval expansion to traditional British command of the seas. It included the observation that Britain would be better served by a war sooner rather than later when the German navy would be bigger. The article was used in Germany to <b>whip</b> up <b>support</b> for the naval program.|$|R
5000|$|Johnson {{had kept}} up his output of books up, {{including}} [...] "A Doctor Returns" [...] (1956) and [...] "A Doctor in Parliament" [...] (1958). He had supported the Net Book Agreement by which resale prices of books were fixed and after Penguin books were acquitted of publishing an obscene book in Lady Chatterley's Lover, {{he asked for}} a system in which publishers could voluntarily submit books for clearance which would be an absolute defence. In April 1961 he broke the Conservative <b>whip</b> to <b>support</b> the return of corporal punishment.|$|R
50|$|In Germany, left-wing parties, {{especially}} the Social Democratic Party of Germany, in the 1912 German election, won the most seats {{for the first}} time. German historian Fritz Fischer famously argued that the Junkers, who dominated Germany, wanted an external war to distract the population and to <b>whip</b> up patriotic <b>support</b> for the government.|$|R
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the war, Featherston drifts for a short while, before joining the newly created Freedom Party. Featherston establishes himself as head propagandist, and eventually becomes its leader, aided by Party member Ferdinand Koenig. With his raw energy and humble origins, Featherston has little trouble <b>whipping</b> up <b>support</b> from much of the Confederate populace, and it seems by the early 1920s that he would surely be leading the country. But with the assassination of President Wade Hampton V in June 1922 by a Party stalwart, the Freedom Party suffers a sudden and near-total collapse as a political force.|$|R
2500|$|Mainwaring {{succeeded in}} winning {{a very narrow}} victory by 972 votes. He was a notably less {{frequent}} speaker in the post-war Parliaments, but kept up his allegiance to the left. In 1946 he broke with the <b>whip</b> to <b>support</b> {{an amendment to the}} Civil Aviation Bill which required the directors of the new airline corporations to be full-time, and to oppose a Lords amendment affecting the Air Traffic Advisory Council. However Mainwaring opposed an amendment to exclude men from Wales and Monmouthshire from the liability to do National Service, declaring that [...] "no decent man or woman in Wales would support the amendment".|$|R
50|$|In the House of Commons, Davies was a loyal Labour backbencher, {{hardly ever}} voting with the {{opposition}} against the Labour government and <b>whip.</b> He <b>supported</b> Labour {{in most of the}} major parliamentary rebellions, including the Iraq war, but opposed the government in voting for an all-elected second chamber during the Reform of the House of Lords.Since returning in 2010, he has voted against the Labour Whip only twice: he voted against having Westminster elections and Welsh Assembly election on the same day and against a free trade deal with Colombia because of the widespread killing and persecution of trade unionists.|$|R

50|$|Gugy {{remained}} {{loyal to}} the British crown during the American Revolution, but was nonetheless harassed by various sympathizers of the cause. One of his tenants on his estate at Rivière-du-Loup accused him of threatening to <b>whip</b> anyone who <b>supported</b> the Americans, but his name was cleared after a trial. In 1776, when the Americans were retreating, they burned some buildings on his seigneuries.|$|R
50|$|In 2001, Goldsberry had {{the lead}} role of Nicole Taylor in the romantic comedy All About You, for which her {{performance}} was praised (although the film itself received mixed reviews). She also portrayed Drea Smalls in the 2008 action film Pistol <b>Whipped,</b> and small <b>supporting</b> roles as Cynthia Barnes in the crime drama Every Secret Thing (2014) and Kim in the comedy Sisters (2015).|$|R
5000|$|Controversy over Waters' {{candidacy}} continued, with Mike Hookem MEP resigning as the party's deputy whip in the European Parliament {{in protest}} at Waters' candidacy {{and at the}} chief <b>whip</b> Stuart Agnew's <b>support</b> for her. Hookem described Waters as [...] "far right". Nathan Gill MEP also said he would leave the party if Waters won. Waters and Whittle both expressed concern at Sharia councils in the UK.|$|R
5000|$|A similar {{arrangement}} {{exists for}} Whips in the House of Lords. The Government Chief Whip is usually appointed Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms, while the Deputy Chief Whip is usually appointed Captain of the Queen's Bodyguard of the Yeomen of the Guard. Other Whips, who are fewer in number {{due to the}} decreased importance of party discipline in the Lords, are appointed as Lords in Waiting if men and Baronesses in Waiting if women. As well as their duties as whips, Lords whips speak in the Chamber (unlike Commons <b>whips)</b> to <b>support</b> departmental ministers or act as a spokesperson for government departments with no minister in the Lords. The current Lords whips are: ...|$|R
5000|$|In February 1942, {{a motion}} of no {{confidence}} in the Huggins government was defeated but with four members of the United Party breaking the <b>whip</b> to <b>support</b> it. Two of them, Edgar Vernall and Frank Thompson, then joined the RLP. Despite the party maneuvring, hopes among Labour supporters were high that some form of reunification could be arrived at after the war. Moves toward reunification had a fortuitous boost when Davies and Keller attended a party congress of [...] "The Labour Party" [...] in October 1943, as Huggins had declared that this was contrary to the spirit of coalition and dismissed them from the government on 12 October. [...] "The Labour Party" [...] then went into opposition.|$|R
5000|$|The {{support for}} both {{candidates}} was about even {{up until the}} very end, however there was one vital difference. Colley {{had the support of}} virtually the entire Cabinet, while Haughey had the support of the majority of backbench TDs. While Colley believed that a short campaign would take his opponent by surprise, Haughey had been anticipating this moment for many years. A group known as the [...] "gang of five", which consisted of Tom McEllistrim, Mark Killilea, Jnr, Seán Doherty, Jackie Fahey and Albert Reynolds, had tried to <b>whip</b> up <b>support</b> for Haughey within the party for the previous few months, as they had anticipated that a change of leadership was imminent.|$|R
2500|$|Colin Irwin, a {{journalist}} for The Guardian, believes the modern British protest movement started in 1958 when the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND) organized a 53-mile march from Trafalgar Square to Aldermaston, to protest Britain's {{participation in the}} arms race and recent testing of the H-bomb. The protest [...] "fired up young musicians to write campaigning new songs to argue {{the case against the}} bomb and <b>whip</b> up <b>support</b> along the way. Suddenly many of those in skiffle groups playing American songs were changing course and writing fierce topical songs to back direct action." [...] A song composed for the march, [...] "The H-Bomb's Thunder", set the words of a poem by novelist John Brunner to the tune of [...] "Miner's Lifeguard": ...|$|R
500|$|In November 1811, a {{messenger}} brought news to Kentucky of former Kentucky Attorney General Joseph Hamilton Daveiss's {{death at the}} Battle of Tippecanoe, amplifying Kentuckians' outcry for war with the British and Indians. In anticipation of a federal call for volunteers, Scott published messages in the state's newspapers in February and April 1812 <b>whipping</b> up <b>support</b> for the impending war effort. By the end of July, the state's quota of 5,500 volunteers had been met. On August 14, 1812, Scott greeted two regiments of soldiers at the governor's mansion just prior to their muster at Georgetown. He hobbled among the soldiers with his crutch, then turned and hammered it against the mansion's steps and was heard to mutter [...] "If it hadn't been for you, I could have gone with the boys myself." ...|$|R
5000|$|Pompey {{forwarded}} to Rome {{the news of}} his surrender and execution. The senate blamed Pompey for the perfidious act. John Leach in his biography of Pompey defends his subject by arguing that Brutus [...] "presumably began to <b>whip</b> up further <b>support</b> for Lepidus (the name of the town suggests that there were hereditary clients of his there)" [...] and so Pompey was [...] "forced" [...] to send Geminius to Regium Lepidi to recapture and execute him.|$|R
50|$|When repatriated {{at the end}} of the war, MacLeod avidly read The Times {{for three}} weeks to get up to speed on British affairs before {{entering}} into politics as a candidate for Ross and Cromarty in the 1945 general election. MacLeod was adopted by the Ross-shire Liberal Association, which was not affiliated to the Liberal Party or the National Liberal Party; he declared himself a supporter of Winston Churchill. Most of the press designated him as a Liberal National and he faced a straight fight with the Labour Party to succeed Malcolm MacDonald. MacLeod had no difficulty in being elected, winning with a majority of 4,102. MacLeod had intended to take the Liberal <b>whip</b> in <b>support</b> of Sir Archie Sinclair, the Liberal leader, who represented the neighbouring constituency but Sinclair was narrowly defeated in the same election.|$|R

50|$|After Macmillan's {{impending}} resignation {{was announced}} in October 1963, Lloyd {{was one of those}} who pressed Alec Douglas-Home to stand for the party leadership. He was a pivotal figure in <b>whipping</b> up <b>support</b> for Home as a potential successor at the Blackpool Conference. He was also an influential figure with the Chief Whip Martin Redmayne. On a walk on the seafront at Blackpool (11 October) Lloyd and Redmayne were accosted by a socialist old age pensioner who told them that Home would make the best Prime Minister. He helped to dissuade Hailsham, who was initially a candidate for the leadership, from openly opposing Home. “Home was just about the only front-line politician Lloyd spoke of without a tinge of contempt.” Lloyd visited Macmillan in hospital on Wednesday 16 October, and advised against appointing Rab Butler, who, he said, was disliked in the constituency associations.|$|R
25|$|Hearst's use {{of yellow}} journalism {{techniques}} in his New York Journal to <b>whip</b> up popular <b>support</b> for U.S. military adventurism in Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines in 1898 was also criticized in Upton Sinclair's 1919 book, The Brass Check: A Study of American Journalism. According to Sinclair, Hearst's newspapers distorted world events and deliberately tried to discredit Socialists. Another critic, Ferdinand Lundberg, extended the criticism in Imperial Hearst (1936), charging that Hearst papers accepted payments from abroad to slant the news. After the war, a further critic, George Seldes, repeated the charges in Facts and Fascism (1947).|$|R
