5|$|Feletti faced a court trial {{under the}} code of laws in effect in Bologna {{at the time of}} Edgardo's removal. Carboni {{proposed}} that even under the pontifical laws, the seizure was illegalâ€”he reported that he had seen no evidence to support the friar's claim that he had acted following instructions from Rome, and that there was substantial evidence casting doubt on Morisi's account, but so far as he could see Feletti had done nothing to verify <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> before ordering the child removed. After Feletti refused to appoint a defence counsel when prompted, saying he was putting his defence in the hands of God and the Virgin Mary, the experienced Bologna lawyer Francesco Jussi was appointed by the state to defend him.|$|E
25|$|The {{case had}} first been brought by Cheryl Churchill, {{a nurse in}} the {{obstetrics}} ward at McDonough District Hospital, operated {{by the city of}} Macomb, Illinois. During a dinner break one night in early 1987, she had been talking with another nurse who was considering transferring to obstetrics. In that conversation she made statements critical of cross-training practices recently implemented by the hospital's nursing supervisor, Cindy Waters, and referred to personal issues between the two. Another nurse who overheard the conversation believed Churchill's comments about Waters had dissuaded her interlocutor from the transfer, and reported it to Waters. After an investigation in which Churchill alleged she was never asked about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said,</b> she was fired.|$|E
500|$|Florence Seymour was {{the first}} person called to the witness box. She said that her {{statement}} was false, and that she had only made it because Edgar Power had told her that she would be charged with murder if she did not. This immediately disrupted the case for the prosecution; Frederick Low had made it clear in his opening statement that their case rested primarily on Seymour's testimony. Low received permission from the judge to treat Seymour as a hostile witness; despite this, she refused to say anything that would incriminate Williams. [...] Hastings did not cross-examine her, only asking if <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> in court was true; she said that it was and then burst into tears.|$|E
60|$|They {{all look}} at one another as if there were some {{sinister}} significance in <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Not precisely," [...] I {{answered}} vaguely; [...] "but from <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> {{then and}} since, {{she made it}} pretty clear that she hadn't any use for him; saw through him, you know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Beg pardon, I am sure, Miss Panney--for <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> about me; {{but when}} I come {{to pay my}} respects to Mrs. Drane, I wish {{to do the same}} to the lady of the house." ...|$|R
500|$|After this failure, Gasper {{returned}} to her blog to argue there were [...] "far too many homosexual comedians on TV", focusing her criticism on Graham Norton, [...] "the horrid little Alan Carr", and [...] "the unctuous Stephen Fry [...] portly, preening and self-satisfied." [...] She also posted that homosexuals were not persecuted {{anywhere in the world}} and that claims to the contrary, such as those regarding the murders of Matthew Shepard and David Kato, were [...] "fraudulent". Pink News, she said, operated as a [...] "mafia" [...] and had placed the actor Rupert Everett on its [...] "hit list", forcing him to obtain police protection. In October 2014, Pink News founder Benjamin Cohen claimed this constituted libel and threatened legal action against her. Gasper responded that she did not simply stand by <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said,</b> but that she was [...] "proud of it and I have morality on my side".|$|E
2500|$|A {{large crowd}} {{gathered}} outside the court {{house for the}} start of the Patterson trial on Monday, April 2. Without the [...] "vivid detail" [...] she had used in the Scottsboro trials, Victoria Price told her account in 16 minutes. The defense had <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> before under oath on paper, and could confront her with any inconsistencies. The only drama came when Knight pulled a torn pair of step-ins from his brief case and tossed them into the lap of a juror to support the claim of rape.|$|E
2500|$|Winthrop {{questioned}} Hutchinson {{heavily on}} her association {{with those who}} had caused trouble in the colony, and on the meetings that she held at her house, but Hutchinson effectively stonewalled this prosecutorial thrust by answering questions with questions and matching scripture with scripture. [...] Dudley then stepped in and confronted her concerning having men at her home meetings and [...] "traducing [...] the ministers" [...] by saying that they [...] "preached a covenant of works, and only Mr. Cotton a covenant of grace." [...] To the latter charge Dudley added, [...] "you {{said they were not}} able ministers of the new testament, but Mr. Cotton only!" [...] This last assertion brought pause to Hutchinson, who knew <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> and to whom she had said it. According to the modern interpretations of Emery Battis, she had assumed that her statements would be confidential and private when she made them during the meetings with the ministers in October 1636.|$|E
6000|$|Prosp. Stay, stay!----I had {{forgot to}} ask her, [...] <b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> of young Hippolito.-- [...] Oh, here he comes! and, with him, my Dorinda: [...] I'll not be seen; let their loves grow in secret. [...] [Exit.|$|R
6000|$|Lady Aylmer {{shook her}} head. [...] "I should like much to know <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> about that unfortunate {{connection}} before I offer {{to take her}} by the hand myself. I'm sure Fred will feel that I ought to do so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When a female, O my king, {{asserts that}} <b>she</b> <b>has</b> {{nothing more to}} say, but," [...] broke in Churaman, the parrot with a loud dogmatical voice, [...] "I know that <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> merely whets her tongue for <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is about to say. This person has surely spoken long enough and drearily enough." ...|$|R
60|$|Rachel {{immediately}} {{tried to}} qualify <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> against her belief.|$|E
60|$|It was queer too {{to recall}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> in court about her daughters....|$|E
60|$|Dick {{heard her}} idly, but within forty-eight hours {{he was to}} {{remember}} with hurt <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{the first}} time since I have been in the house, my door is locked. I cannot, and will not, see Mrs. Gallilee again. All her former cruelties are, as I feel it, nothing to the cruelty of her coming here when I am ill, and saying to me <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
60|$|Gillian {{began to}} be quite afraid of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> might <b>have</b> <b>said.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It's sheer nonsense," [...] said Beam, {{turning away}} from the window and {{throwing}} himself into a chair; [...] "why should an old fellow like Tippengray take up all the spare time of that girl? She doesn't need to learn anything. From <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> to me I judge that she knows too much already." ...|$|R
60|$|Marie, as {{she thought}} of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said,</b> repented so bitterly that she could hardly refrain from tears.|$|E
60|$|His word, swift as a bullet, {{made her}} jump, but she {{repeated}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> almost word for word.|$|E
60|$|Later in the evening, {{when she}} gave her niece a {{candlestick}} to go to bed, she repeated <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> before.|$|E
60|$|The servant {{takes as}} little heed {{of what he}} says as she seems to take of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> herself. <b>She</b> draws off her glove to get some money from her purse. Jo silently notices how white and small her hand is and what a jolly servant she must be to wear such {{sparkling}} rings.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Mool waited, {{and waited}} in vain. He {{reminded}} his client of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> just <b>said.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Isabel {{instantly}} protested {{against this}} misrepresentation of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> really <b>said,</b> [...] "Oh, Mr. Hardyman, you quite mistake me!" ...|$|R
60|$|The old man's {{eyes filled}} with tears, as Catharine, visibly and painfully {{affected}} by <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said,</b> became at length silent.|$|E
6000|$|... 12th.--Sir Percival {{put some}} {{questions}} {{to me at}} breakfast about Laura, which left me {{no choice but to}} tell him <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
60|$|Helen {{reflected}} that as, from <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said,</b> Rachel certainly would think these things out, {{it might be}} as well to help her.|$|E
60|$|To him succeeds Sarah, who in like {{manner is}} easy to be managed by Mr Brass's gentleman, but very obdurate to Kit's. In short, Kit's gentleman can get nothing out of her but a {{repetition}} of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> before (only a little stronger this time, as against his client), and therefore lets her go, in some confusion. Then, Mr Brass's gentleman calls Richard Swiveller, and Richard Swiveller appears accordingly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{want you}} to repeat them; nor yet to heed them beyond their worth. Lily Dale is a very pretty girl; clever, too, I believe, and good, I'm sure; but her words are not more sacred than those of other men or women. <b>What</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>said</b> to you now, she means, no doubt; but the minds {{of men and women}} are prone to change, {{especially}} when such changes are conducive to their own happiness." ...|$|R
50|$|Mrs. Pringle {{sees her}} {{chance to get}} back at the Archers, so she goes there and claims that Corliss is {{pregnant}} and that Jimmy is the father. Corliss doesn't want Mildred and her brother to get into trouble, so she admits to being pregnant. When Mrs. Archer tries to call Jimmy's superior officer to scold him, Corliss says Dexter is the father. Then she intercepts her mother by telling Dexter <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>has</b> <b>said,</b> asking him to help her out by lying.|$|R
60|$|She {{laughed in}} a half-hysterical manner, {{and he remembered}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> about the treasury, and that fares are high in that country.|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, she's amazing--she's amazing," [...] I repeated; [...] "but so are you." [...] And then I {{asked her}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> to my boy.|$|E
60|$|There {{seemed to}} be no help for her, so Timtom left the room sadly, and going to the King, told him <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> <b>said.</b>|$|E
60|$|Miss Mackenzie did {{not dare}} to say that <b>she</b> would <b>have</b> {{preferred}} to be wicked, but that is <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would <b>have</b> <b>said</b> if <b>she</b> <b>had</b> dared.|$|R
6000|$|But {{fortunately}} at {{this juncture}} Miss Trevor was captured again, and Miss Thorn put {{her hand over her}} mouth. Heaven only knows <b>what</b> <b>she</b> would <b>have</b> <b>said!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of that, your Highness, I {{can recall}} nothing, or very little," [...] then, doubtless remembering <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>had</b> just <b>said</b> to me, she made obeisance and {{passed from the}} chamber.|$|R
