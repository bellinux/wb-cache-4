25|$|Madame Patti has {{practically}} {{opened the}} Severn Tunnel… It {{is true that}} very few people knew it, and perhaps Madame Patti herself did not know it, but everybody <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> about it to everybody else. The facts are these. On Sunday Madame Patti and party—a large one—wanted to get from London to Neath with comfort and speed. A special train was arranged for, and the great songstress paid for {{it out of her}} own pocket, or wherever she keeps the great piles of money she has made. Many people will be interested to know that the special train ran along the new route through the Severn Tunnel, and that the whole distance from Paddington to Neath was comfortably traversed in four hours and twelve minutes. This was the first through train from London to South Wales via Bristol and the Severn Tunnel, and Madame Patti chartered it, rode in it, and paid for it, and therefore she has the honour of having opened the Severn Tunnel route to London.|$|E

Between the third and the ninth of December 1894, The Red Badge of Courage was published in some half-dozen newspapers in the United States. Although it was greatly cut for syndication, Bacheller attested to its causing a stir, saying [...] "its quality [...] immediately felt and recognized." [...] The lead editorial in the Philadelphia Press of December 7 said that Crane [...] "is a new name now and unknown, but everybody <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> about him if he goes on as he has begun".|$|E
500|$|Falcons coach Dan Reeves {{was praised}} {{for his ability}} to lead the team after having heart surgery only weeks prior, as Reeves' {{comeback}} proved to be an emotional rallying point for the team. Austin Murphy of Sports Illustrated noted that Reeves' return [...] " [...] the already close-knit Falcons," [...] and Falcons linebacker Jessie Tuggle agreed: [...] "Dan has really inspired us all. [...] He walked in the meeting room four days after having had surgery, and you could have heard a pin drop. We wanted to hear every last word he had to say." [...] Reeves described his time during the season as [...] "more rewarding than any other teams I've been involved in," [...] and to Falcons special teams coach Joe DeCamillis, Reeves' leadership that season was [...] "his best coaching job ever." [...] CBS called Reeves' return [...] "an amazing comeback that people <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> about for years." ...|$|E

[...] "However I <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> to him... and I will seek an assurance that nothing of this nature will happen again".

They have expressed satisfaction regarding the finale; Daniel Dae Kim stated [...] "If you think about how many pieces the writers had to put together {{in order to make it}} fall into place, it’s mind-boggling, and they did such a great job... For me it was very satisfying. After I read it, I had to sit for five or 10 minutes, just reflecting and digesting, because it definitely makes an impact." [...] Emerson said: [...] Carbonell described the finale as being [...] "all about everyone’s resolutions." [...] Cusick said [...] "There are so many walks of life getting together to talk about the show and so many issues to be brought up and that's exactly what the ending will bring up.

He said {{that the difference between}} Lofty's [...] "awkwardness and sincerity" [...] and Dylan's [...] "very dry and direct" [...] approach made [...] "a good contrast". Mead revealed that he and Beck often kept [...] "getting the giggles" [...] in takes. In a 2015 interview with Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy, Hossington teased the show's Christmas episode and revealed that Lofty and Dylan would feature in what would be [...] "the most fantastic ending". She added that [...] "people <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> about [...] for a very long time!" [...] In late 2015, Hossington said she enjoyed Lofty's relationship with Dylan and described them as [...] "the odd couple" [...] with a [...] "fun bromance". Mead noted that the pairing was [...] "strange" [...] yet [...] "quite special", which was amusing and hoped that following his move to Holby City, he would appear in Casualty to develop Lofty's friendship with Dylan. He told Brown (Radio Times) that the characters formed a [...] "funny bond" [...] and found them a strange pairing that developed over time.|$|E

Hearn told Sky Sports, [...] "We met with Richard Sturm and the team at MGM in Las Vegas yesterday and had a full tour of the T-Mobile Arena which is very impressive. There is a huge appetite from both sides to hold the rematch there and we <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> further over the next week or so to see if that can become a reality." [...] Showtime's Stephen Espinoza said a deal could be reached quickly, as he was also eager to get Joshua, who has a contract with Showtime, to fight in USA, [...] "It's no secret we've been salivating about getting him over here and certainly that would be a phenomenal fight.
