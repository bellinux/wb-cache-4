5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of people that are {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E

In 1940, Potter remarked upon the illustration of Jemima rushing downhill with her bonnet and shawl askew, [...] "That is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> look like to the Sawrey people. I rushed about quacking industriously." ...|$|E

500|$|... "A Change in Me" [...] was {{originally}} published in the key of D major, performed at a slow tempo. A [...] "belty" [...] pop ballad often performed within [...] "a plaintive register", its lead vocal spans two octaves, from A3 to F5. Like most of the musical's songs, the melody of [...] "A Change in Me" [...] is borrowed from the film's orchestral score. The New Jersey Montly summarized [...] "A Change in Me" [...] as [...] "a soaring number about how adventure comes in many forms." [...] Beginning, [...] "There's been a change in me a kind of moving on though <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be", the song was identified by author Thomas S. Hischak as a delicate, [...] "moving ballad". Lyrically, the song is [...] "about being at peace with oneself and how it’s expected as you grow up." [...] It has also been described as [...] "uplifting", featuring the lyrics [...] "I never thought I’d leave behind / My childhood dreams / But I don’t mind / I’m where and who I want to be". The chorus ends [...] "Now I love the world I see / No change of heart–a change in me".|$|E
2500|$|Dean starred for the Cardinals {{as one of}} baseball's premier {{pitchers}} from 1932 to 1937, {{with four}} All-Star Games, leading the NL in wins and shutouts twice, strikeouts four times, complete games and innings pitched three times, while procuring an MVP award with two runner-up finishes. [...] He also carried a distinctive persona when off the mound. [...] Dean was a robust, zany, quasi-Yogi Berra-prototype who uttered such memorable quotes as, [...] "It ain't bragging {{if you can do}} it", [...] "Son, what kind of pitch would you like to miss?", [...] "He slud into third", [...] "I ain't <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be, but who the hell is?", [...] "The doctors x-rayed my head and found nothing", [...] "The good Lord was good to me. [...] He gave me a strong body, a good right arm, and a weak mind", and [...] "It puzzles me how they know what corners are good for filling stations. [...] Just how did they know gas and oil was under there?" [...] His uninhibited nature and willingness to become a lightning rod for criticism garnered massive popularity with teammates, fans and media alike. [...] After retiring as a player, Dean augmented even more popularity as a sportscaster and was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1953.|$|E
2500|$|... "My lack {{of fear of}} this barbaric {{methodology}} of death, I rely upon my faith. It {{has nothing to do}} with machismo, with manhood, or with some pseudo former gang street code. This is pure faith, and predicated on my redemption. So, therefore, I just stand strong and continue to tell you, your audience, and the world that I am innocent and, yes, I have been a wretched person, but I have redeemed myself. And I say to you and all those who can listen and will listen that redemption is tailor-made for the wretched, and that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be…That's what I would like the world to remember me. That's how I would like my legacy to be remembered as: a redemptive transition, something that I believe is not exclusive just for the so-called sanctimonious, the elitists. And it doesn't—is not predicated on color or race or social stratum or one's religious background. It's accessible for everybody. That's the beauty about it. And whether others choose to believe that I have redeemed myself or not, I worry not, because I know and God knows, and you can believe that all of the youths that I continue to help, they know, too. So with that, I am grateful…I say to you and everyone else, God bless. So take care." ...|$|E

5000|$|It {{was more}} of a collaboration. He had an idea and a vision when he wrote the script. I think I {{was more of}} {{somebody}} that kept it in the guidelines of what he wanted. He was like, here go the eggs, the milk, the cake, the sugar, everything, and I’m going to stir it up. Put this in the oven, watch it, take it out in forty-five minutes. Now, am I going to take it out in forty five minutes or am I going to fall asleep? I made sure it got out and if I saw something wrong with it, I fixed it. So when he saw it, he was like, this is cake. There was one situation where you see, [...] "Crane and White Lightning." [...] That’s part of the original score, so it’s not really a song. A lot of that stuff is <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> keep the vibe going between songs.|$|R
50|$|Each {{picture is}} a link in a chain, {{and they all}} exist in {{counterpoint}} with the text. And although you want each picture to have impact, just like a jacket, the book illustration can also be much more subtle. It can be pondered and savored {{over a period of}} time. It's a very different discipline from <b>what</b> <b>I</b> was <b>used</b> <b>to,</b> but <b>I</b> must say {{it was love at first}} sight.|$|R
5000|$|Schoen {{was also}} {{extremely}} {{impressed with the}} sound of the Basie band, [...] "There was quite a large difference {{in the way that the}} white bands played versus the black bands.
