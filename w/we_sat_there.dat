2500|$|A {{supervisor}} in another building 300 yards away heard the fire alarm and walked outside. He {{had served in}} Vietnam, but said the explosion was worse than anything encountered in his war experience: [...] "I watched B-52s drop 500-pound bombs. This is the biggest explosion I ever saw and I saw some pretty good-sized ones. When it blew, the explosion kept rolling out, rolling out. <b>We</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> and watched the ball of fire coming toward us." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>We</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{that day}} in 1987 and talked about my music to that point, my short career, and what I'd been doing and how he'd been {{watching}} me. [...] I was really flattered and thrilled {{to know that this}} legend had been keeping an eye on me. Owens also collaborated with Cledus T. Judd in the song [...] "The First Redneck On The Internet" [...] in 1998, in which Owens also appears in the music video.|$|E
2500|$|And I {{passed a}} house, {{and there was}} a woman, and I {{remember}} that she was a little tongue-tied, sitting on a step. And she saw what was happening, and she called me in. And she spent about 20 minutes treating me like an adult, teaching me how - of course the ends were gone off the shoestrings - to twist the end and put it through the hole. Then we laced and unlaced my shoes three or four times until I knew how to do it, and then she taught me how to tie a knot. And <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> for a while, and then I went along. And, as little as I was, I thought, [...] "I'd like to be like that kind of person. I'd like to be like her." [...] I think it influenced my entire life, a little thing.|$|E
60|$|Our {{glasses were}} filled, and <b>we</b> still <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> dazed and dumb. Then Basil spoke.|$|R
6000|$|... "No,--no," [...] replied Rothermel. [...] "I was not conscious, at least, of so doing. And yet had <b>we</b> two <b>sat</b> down <b>there</b> by the wayside, or on that English stile, which {{attracted}} {{your attention}} so much; had <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>there</b> and thrown forth each his own dream, each his own knowledge, {{it would have}} saved much that we must now forever regret. Are you even now ready to confide wholly in me?" ...|$|R
60|$|Then as <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> {{in silence}} <b>there</b> came a low tapping at the door. Ray {{looked at me}} keenly.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It's {{just as we}} said,' she {{remarked to}} me as <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there.</b> 'It is like the bucket in the well. When I come up that girl goes down.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{just as we}} said," [...] she {{remarked to}} me as <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there.</b> [...] "It's like the buckets in the well. When I come up {{everything}} else goes down." ...|$|E
6000|$|Only a {{few minutes}} ago. I confess it was an impulse. I think that I {{realized}} as <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> how dear you had grown to me, Mary--how dull life was without you." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> three <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{and talked}} {{for half an}} hour or so. Then Chloe looked out yearningly and almost piteously across the ocean. I could see in her sea-blue eyes some deep and intense desire. Devoe, curse him! saw it too.|$|R
5000|$|... "When {{we were at}} his {{concert at}} the Irkutsk Philharmonic Organ Hall, <b>we</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> with opened mouths — so beautifully he sings. And what a {{powerful}} voice! Leonid sang without a microphone, but even those who {{sat in the back}} rows could hear every word so clearly as if he were not on stage, but standing right next to them." [...] - Kopeck (Копейка), performance review, 2006 ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Psycho Circus" [...] {{was written}} by guitarist/vocalist Paul Stanley and Curt Cuomo {{specifically}} to fit {{the theme of the}} Psycho Circus Tour and album. According to producer Bruce Fairbairn, [...] "We didn't have an opener for the record. We didn't have anything that was going to start things off. And Paul just looked at me and said, 'check this. This is it...' <b>We</b> both <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> and {{looked at each other and}} started to laugh. Because that was it" ...|$|R
60|$|A short {{month ago}} {{we would have}} repudiated Bones; today <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> in {{slightly}} supercilious attitudes, as if to indicate that any affront offered to Bones would be an insult to ourselves, and followed by our instantaneous withdrawal in a body.|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> a while longer, slowly calming down. Wonderful indeed {{had been}} some of the moments of thrill, {{but there had been}} others not conducive to happiness. Why do men yearn for {{adventure}} in wild moments and regret the risks and spilled blood afterward? ...|$|E
60|$|Vivid in {{my memory}} is {{the picture of the}} last night as <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> talking in low tones of the strange romance which had woven our lives {{together}} and of this wonder which was coming to augment our happiness and fulfill our hopes.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nonsense!" [...] I cried. But Ismay {{was already}} half {{way up the}} stairs and we followed. Straight to the garret <b>we</b> rushed. <b>There</b> <b>sat</b> Fatima, sleek and complacent, sunning herself in the window.|$|R
60|$|Whether it {{was because}} <b>we</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> so long, or because Steerforth was {{resolved}} not to lose the advantage he had gained, I do not know; {{but we did not}} remain in the dining-room more than five minutes after her departure. 'She is playing her harp,' said Steerforth, softly, at the drawing-room door, 'and nobody but my mother has heard her do that, I believe, these three years.' He said it with a curious smile, which was gone directly; and we went into the room and found her alone.|$|R
60|$|Two of {{the windows}} of these {{chambers}} {{looked down into the}} garden; and <b>we</b> have <b>sat</b> up <b>there</b> together many a summer evening, saying how pleasant it was, and talking of many things. To my intimacy with that top set, I am indebted for three of my liveliest personal impressions of the loneliness of life in chambers. They shall follow here, in order; first, second, and third.|$|R
60|$|Every {{member of}} the party was eager to be doing something, but so far as having any plan in mind, they were all like me, and <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> staring at each other {{like a lot of}} frightened rabbits until I could remain idle no longer.|$|E
6000|$|<b>We</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> until {{nearly ten}} o'clock. When we rose to go Mr. Bundercombe turned to us. [...] "Say," [...] he asked, a little diffidently, [...] "would you people object to just {{dropping}} {{in at this}} Giatron's? Or will you go off somewhere by yourselves and meet me afterward?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Of course I felt my {{good faith}} {{involved}} in the observance of his request. The punch being very nice, <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> drinking it and talking, until it was almost nine o'clock. [...] "Getting near gun-fire," [...] said Wemmick then, as he laid down his pipe; [...] "it's the Aged's treat." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>sat</b> down together, <b>there</b> on the grass, and the revulsion {{of feeling}} {{was so great}} that really I think we cried with joy. We had escaped from that awful dungeon, which was so near to {{becoming}} our grave. Surely some merciful Power guided our footsteps to the jackal hole, for that is what it must have been, at the termination of the tunnel. And see, yonder on the mountains the dawn we had never thought to look upon again was blushing rosy red.|$|R
60|$|However, as it were, tired {{with that}} kind of work, <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> down, and <b>there</b> he talked with me a great while; he said he was charmed with me, and that he could not rest night or day till he had told me how {{he was in love with}} me, and, if I was able to love him again, and would make him happy, I should be the saving of his life, and many such fine things. I said little to him again, but easily {{discovered}} that I was a fool, and that I did not in the least perceive what he meant.|$|R
5000|$|The album {{went through}} various name changes during its {{inception}} including Wanted Dead Or Alive, an album cover was produced {{with the band}} dressed as cowboys, owing to Jon's growing cowboy fetish. The artwork was later used for the single release of the track of the same name), with Slippery When Wet being the final title conceived. According to Jon Bon Jovi, the band decided to name the album Slippery When Wet after visiting The No.5 Orange strip club in Vancouver. According to Richie Sambora, [...] "this woman descended from the ceiling on a pole and proceeded to take all her clothes off. When she got in a shower and soaped herself up, we just about lost our tongues. <b>We</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> and said, ‘We will be here every day.’ That energized us through the whole project. Our testosterone was {{at a very high}} level back then." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> {{and watched}} Dick and Aunt Tommy for an hour. I {{thought they were}} awfully prim and stiff. If I'd been Dick I'd have gone over and hugged her. I said so to Jill and Jill was shocked. She said it wouldn't be proper when they weren't even engaged.|$|E
60|$|And as <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> gazing and listening, a {{human voice}} {{came out of}} the night--a call {{prolonged}} and modulated like the coo-ee of the Australian bush, far off and faint; but the children in the kitchen heard it at the same time, for they too had been listening, and instantly went mad with excitement.|$|E
60|$|As <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> the Awkward Man passed by, {{with his}} gun over his {{shoulder}} and his dog at his side. He did not look like an awkward man, there {{in the heart of the}} maple woods. He strode along right masterfully and lifted his head with the air of one who was monarch of all he surveyed.|$|E
6000|$|Before dark, {{we had to}} go below, for {{the captain}} said he didn't want any of us to roll overboard, and, besides, the spray from the high waves made the deck very wet and unpleasant. None of us liked it below. There was no place to sit but in the long saloon, where the dining-tables were, and after supper <b>we</b> all <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> and read. Mr. Chipperton had a lot of novels, and we each took one. But it wasn't much fun. I couldn't get {{interested}} in my story,--at least, not in the beginning of it. I think that people who want to use up time when they are travelling ought to take what Rectus called a [...] "begun" [...] novel along with them. He had got on pretty well in his book while he was in Nassau, and so just took it up now and went right along.|$|R
6000|$|He {{preferred}} to receive {{me in the}} dim, large hall after opening his door to me himself, and <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> down <b>there</b> and talked, I remember, of supernatural things. He was much interested in spiritualism, and he had several stories to tell of his own experience in such matters. But none was so good as one which I had at second hand from Lowell, who thought it almost the best ghost story he had ever heard. The spirit of Willson's father appeared to him, and stood before him. Willson was accustomed to apparitions, and so he said simply, [...] "Won't you sit down, father?" [...] The phantom put {{out his hand to}} lay hold of a chair-back as some people do in taking a seat, and his shadowy arm passed through the frame-work. [...] "Ah!" [...] he said, [...] "I forgot that I was not substance." ...|$|R
500|$|Slipknot {{recorded}} Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses with producer Rick Rubin at The Mansion in Los Angeles, California in 2003. Earlier {{there had}} been speculation regarding {{the possibility of a}} third album and the band's future, as some members worked on other musical projects. After the album was completed, the band said that these side projects [...] "saved the band" [...] and [...] "helped [...] break out of the box [...] were in". Coming back together and working out their differences hindered the writing process initially. During an interview in 2008, drummer Joey Jordison said [...] "we didn't talk to each other for three months, <b>we</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> wasting money in the fucking Houdini mansion." [...] Speaking retrospectively percussionist Shawn Crahan states; [...] "eventually we got sick of waiting for shit to happen. We got together, had a few beers and wrote a really artsy, fucked up song called 'Happy Ending'." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> like statues, and I {{dare say}} fear {{was written on}} every face, even on that of the Jerseyman's, when Abel Hunt in his {{bullying}} way strode {{into the center of}} the room and stood there gazing around at us as if to say we were at his mercy, and would obey his lightest word because we dared not do otherwise.|$|E
60|$|Lady Dedlock again sat {{looking at}} the rain. The storm soon began to pass upon its way. The shower greatly abated, the {{lightning}} ceased, the thunder rolled among the distant hills, and the sun began to glisten on the wet leaves and the falling rain. As <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there,</b> silently, we saw a little pony phaeton coming towards us at a merry pace.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> an hour, with {{chattering}} {{teeth and}} quivering bodies, and quarreled over {{all sorts of}} trifles, but gave most of our attention to abusing {{each other for the}} stupidity of deserting the railway-track. We sat with our backs to the precipice, because what little wind there was came from that quarter. At some time or other the fog thinned a little; we did not know when, for we were facing the empty universe and the thinness could not show; but at last Harris happened to look around, and there stood a huge, dim, spectral hotel where the precipice had been. One could faintly discern the windows and chimneys, and a dull blur of lights. Our first emotion was deep, unutterable gratitude, our next was a foolish rage, born of the suspicion that possibly the hotel had been visible three-quarters of an hour while <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> in those cold puddles quarreling.|$|E
5000|$|Life Is Hard: [...] "'Life Is Hard' was {{referred}} to as the worst song on the record by everybody. That song could have been replaced by any of four songs. I was doing an interview with Musician magazine; the guy was in the studio with us. I was in New York, doing mixing. I said, [...] "What {{do you think is the}} worst song on the record?" [...] I've known this guy a long time. He wouldn't make a commitment. So I said, 'I think 'Life Is Hard' is the worst song, so let's work on that.' I have to tip my hat to Junior. Junior saved that song. In a matter of two hours, it went from not going to make the record to one of my favorite songs on the record. He put a couple of loops on there and then <b>we</b> all <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> - me and Mike and Junior and Andy - and started cutting up these weird holes in the song. It was all Junior's inspiration." ...|$|R
5000|$|While {{the project}} was still without a name, in February 1996, a chance {{encounter}} in New Orleans would lead the band onto Nothing Records. While visiting for Mardi Gras, Halford made an impromptu visit to Nothing Studios, where he met Trent Reznor. Halford recalled, “I was in New Orleans at Mardi Gras, where I go every year, and was partying with some friends and they pointed out where Trent’s studio was. One of my friends said, ‘Why don’t you go {{knock on the door}} and say hi?’ I never do that kind of thing. For whatever reason, I {{got out of the car}} and walked across the street and banged on the door. Rave Ogilvie opened the door and welcomed me in. We’d never met before, but he was just a really nice, cool guy and he showed me around the studio. A little while later Trent showed up and we’d never met before either. <b>We</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> and talked about this that and the other. He knew I had some demos with me and asked to listen to the music. He listened to it and asked me if I’d leave the cassette, which I did, and that was that really. We hung out together for a couple of more days, because he was in some of the parades and so forth. But then I just went back to Phoenix and didn’t hear anything from him for the longest time." ...|$|R
500|$|According to Jean, Jackson {{would not}} {{commit to the}} episode until after a {{read-through}} of the script was done. The read was held at Jackson's manager Sandy Gallin's house, and Dan Castellaneta (who provides the voice for Homer) was 30 minutes late. Jean recalls that [...] "no one said a word, <b>we</b> just <b>sat</b> <b>there</b> waiting". Following the read, Jackson stipulated his conditions: he would record his speaking parts but not receive credit, and his singing voice would be performed by a sound-alike. Leon Kompowsky's singing parts were performed by Kipp Lennon, because Jackson wanted to play a joke on his brothers and fool them into thinking the impersonator was him. Lennon recorded his lines {{at the same time}} as Jackson, who found the impersonations humorous. Jackson showed up for the recording session alone and did not use the special trailer that was set up for him. According to Jean, Jackson did record versions of the singing parts, and while there have been rumors that those parts were the ones used in the final episode, The Simpsons music editor Chris Ledesma has stated the Lennon versions were used. Kompowsky's normal speaking voice, which is heard at the end of the episode, was recorded by cast member Hank Azaria. The episode originally was supposed to end with Kompowsky singing a portion of [...] "Man in the Mirror" [...] in his Michael Jackson voice as he walked down the road, but it was changed to him singing the beginning of [...] "Happy Birthday Lisa".|$|R
