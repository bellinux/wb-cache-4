5|$|Debates {{over the}} origin of falafel have {{sometimes}} devolved into political discussions {{about the relationship between}} Arabs and Israelis. In modern times, falafel has been considered a national dish of Egypt, Palestine, and of Israel. Resentment exists amongst many Palestinians for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> the appropriation of their dish by Israelis. Additionally, the Lebanese Industrialists' Association has raised assertions of copyright infringement against Israel concerning falafel.|$|E
5|$|Environmentalists, urban {{planners}} and cycling enthusiasts {{around the world}} have expressed interest in the Cycle Center, and want to emulate <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> a success story in urban planning and transit-oriented development. Pro-cycling and environmentalist journalists in publications well beyond the Chicago metropolitan area have described the Cycle Center as exemplary, impressive, unique and ground-breaking.|$|E
5|$|After the new Burgundians realise {{they are}} not subject to post-war {{rationing}} or other bureaucratic restrictions, the district is quickly flooded with black marketeers and shoppers; Spiller is unable to handle the rising problems by himself. In response, the British authorities surround the Burgundian territory with barbed wire. The residents retaliate against <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> heavy-handed bureaucratic action; they stop a London Underground train as it passes through Burgundy, and ask to see passports of all passengers: those without documents are unable to proceed.|$|E
5000|$|According to The Economist, {{following}} the June fighting [...] "Libya's leaders are celebrating <b>what</b> <b>they</b> herald {{as the beginning}} of the end of militia rule and the restoration of a functioning state", while Libya's liberals [...] "cheer the demise of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the armed wing of their Islamist foes.".|$|R
50|$|His {{family moved}} to Montreal, Canada in 1926, where Tolkin became known as Samuel. He studied {{accounting}} {{after graduating from high}} school, and surreptitiously entered show business by composing songs and sketches for local revues and playing piano in jazz clubs. Fearing his parents would disapprove of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would <b>see</b> <b>as</b> an impractical career choice, he began using the pseudonym Mel Tolkin.|$|R
5000|$|As {{a growing}} world {{religion}} {{with its own}} doctrines and history, the Bahá'í Faith has not been without its critics, who have {{from time to time}} found fault with some or all of its teachings and precepts, discovered <b>what</b> <b>they</b> have <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> contradictions and inconsistencies in its history, and even raised controversial questions about specific policies and actions of past and existing administrative bodies.|$|R
5|$|In 2015, Cheney {{published}} another book, , again co-authored {{with his}} daughter Liz. The book traces the history of U.S. foreign policy and military successes and failures from Franklin Roosevelt's administration through the Obama administration. The authors {{tell the story of}} what they describe as the unique role the United States has played as a defender of freedom throughout the world since World War II. Drawing upon the notion of American exceptionalism, the co-authors criticize Barack Obama's and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's foreign policies, and offer <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> the solutions needed to restore American greatness and power on the world stage in defense of freedom.|$|E
5|$|White {{nationalist}} {{websites such as}} Stormfront and Counter-Currents {{have taken}} issue with <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> lowbrow coverage on The Daily Stormer, as well as Anglin's defense of Christianity and denunciation of the white supremacist group Christian Identity. Kyle Rogers of the Council of Conservative Citizens has also criticized the website for reprinting its material. Anglin has also been criticized for his relationships with non-white women in the Philippines, and for his insults towards white women on his website.|$|E
25|$|Since its founding, the ULA has {{constantly}} {{engaged in}} its own brand of “literary activism” which has gained the group a notoriety for exposing <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> corruption in the American literary world and for harshly criticizing corporate-promulgated literary fiction.|$|E
50|$|The {{monument}} {{became an}} embarrassment {{in a more}} political sense in 1945 when the Allied victory in the Pacific War forced Thailand to evacuate the territories it had gained in 1941 and return them to France. Many Thais regard the monument as an inappropriate symbol of militarism and a relic of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> now <b>see</b> <b>as</b> a discredited regime. Nevertheless, the monument remains one of Bangkok's most familiar landmarks.|$|R
2500|$|Overextension: When a child says or hears a word, <b>they</b> might {{associate}} <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> or hear <b>as</b> more generalized concept {{than the}} real meaning of the word. For example, if they say [...] "cat", they might overextend it to other animals with same features.|$|R
50|$|In Hawaiian mythology, luakini heiaus {{were first}} {{established}} by Paʻao, a legendary priest credited with establishing {{many of the}} rites and symbols typical of the stratified high chieftainships of the immediate pre-European-contact period. Modern archaeologists no longer believe in a historic Pa'ao, but many Native Hawaiians still {{believe that he was}} a historical figure, and often vilify him for introducing <b>what</b> <b>they</b> now <b>see</b> <b>as</b> the bloody, barbarous rites of the luakini heiau.|$|R
25|$|The Underground Literary Alliance is a Philadelphia-based {{and internationally}} {{membered}} group of writers, zinesters and DIY writers. They seek to expose <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> the corruption and insularity in the American book-publishing establishment while providing alternative avenues for writers who don't easily fit into mainstream institutions and agendas.|$|E
25|$|Copts in Egypt {{complain}} of increasing persecution, from attacks by Muslim extremists and <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> official discrimination by the state. Copts celebrate Christmas on 7 January. This {{was the second}} consecutive Christmas with violence. On Christmas Eve in 2010, a Muslim gunman fired on worshipers leaving a church in Upper Egypt, killing 7 people.|$|E
25|$|Some critics {{dispute the}} {{portrayal}} of aging as a disease. For example, Leonard Hayflick, who determined that fibroblasts are limited to around 50cell divisions, reasons that aging is an unavoidable consequence of entropy. Hayflick and fellow biogerontologists Jay Olshansky and Bruce Carnes have strongly criticized the anti-aging industry in response to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> unscrupulous profiteering {{from the sale of}} unproven anti-aging supplements.|$|E
60|$|My {{wife and}} the rest of the party {{returned}} from the convent before noon, delighted with <b>what</b> <b>they</b> had <b>seen,</b> <b>as</b> I was delighted not to have seen it. We ate our dejeuner, and resumed our journey, passing beneath the great convent, after emerging from the gate opposite to that of our entrance. The edifice made a very good spectacle, being of great extent, and standing on a double row of high and narrow arches, on which it is built up from the declivity of the hill.|$|R
25|$|The game added hugely to {{the rivalry}} {{between the two}} teams in England where they {{felt that they had}} been cheated out of the {{competition}} by Maradona's handball. The importance of both goals for the English people can be <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> the fact <b>they</b> were chosen sixth in the list of 100 Greatest Sporting Moments in 2002 by Channel 4. Meanwhile, in Argentina, the game was <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> revenge for the Falklands War and for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> still <b>see</b> <b>as</b> the unfair game in the 1966 World Cup.|$|R
25|$|Eddy and Boyd {{state that}} there is no {{evidence}} of a historical influence by outside sources on the authors of the New Testament, and most scholars agree that any such historical influence on Christianity is entirely implausible given that first century monotheistic Galilean Jews would not have been open to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would have <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> pagan stories.|$|R
25|$|Many of Frist's {{opponents have}} {{attacked}} him for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> pandering to future Republican primary voters. They claim {{he has taken}} extreme positions on social {{issues such as the}} Terri Schiavo case to please them. However, Frist changed his position on stem cell research. Frist received enormous praise from former First Lady Nancy Reagan for supporting expanded federal financing for stem cell research.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the biggest}} steps, which is also controversial, is {{a new system of}} registrations, passports, and travel visas to control the flow of pilgrims. This system is {{designed}} to encourage and accommodate first-time visitors to Mecca, while restricting repeat visits. Pilgrims who have the means and desire to perform the Hajj several times have protested <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> discrimination, but the Hajj Commission has stated that they see no alternative if further tragedies are to be prevented.|$|E
25|$|In the 18th century Adam Smith {{presented}} a philosophical foundation for explaining {{the relationship between}} law and economics. The discipline arose partly out of a critique of trade unions and U.S. antitrust law. The most influential proponents, such as Richard Posner and Oliver Williamson and the so-called Chicago School of economists and lawyers including Milton Friedman and Gary Becker, are generally advocates of deregulation and privatisation, and are hostile to state regulation or <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> restrictions on the operation of free markets.|$|E
2500|$|Hodge swapped {{shirts with}} Maradona after the game; Hodge lent out the Argentine's jersey to the National Football Museum in the 2000s. The game added hugely to the rivalry {{between the two}} teams in England where many {{felt that they had}} been cheated out of the {{competition}} by Maradona's handball. Meanwhile, in Argentina, the game was <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> revenge for the Falklands War and for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> still <b>see</b> <b>as</b> the unfair game in the 1966 World Cup. The former Argentine international Roberto Perfumo stated that [...] "In 1986, winning that game against England was enough. Winning the World Cup was secondary for us. Beating England was our real aim".|$|R
40|$|The {{second round}} in the UK {{election}} debate last night showed great differences in the party leaders’ foreign policy agendas. Not least on Europe, where Nick Clegg and Gordon Brown’s challenge of David Cameron’s more Euro-sceptical views on ‘Brussels’ meant that both sides had to elaborate on <b>what</b> exactly <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> {{the pros and cons}} of EU membership. It is not the first time in UK politics that ‘Europe’ is on the table at election time. However, it is hard to recall a debate over real policies – i. e. cooperation on unemployment, crime, climate change, trade, etc – rather than just the question of whether or not Brussels has moved into Westminster and taken over decision-making in core UK policy domains...|$|R
50|$|Where a {{data storage}} device has been {{partitioned}} with the GPT scheme, the {{master boot record}} will still contain a partition table, but its only purpose is to indicate {{the existence of the}} GPT and to prevent utility programs which understand only the MBR partition table scheme from creating any partitions in <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would otherwise <b>see</b> <b>as</b> free space on the disk, thereby accidentally erasing the GPT.|$|R
25|$|In their 1993 book, The Guru Papers, authors Diana Alstad and Joel Kramer {{reject the}} guru-disciple {{tradition}} because of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> its structural defects. These defects include the authoritarian {{control of the}} guru over the disciple, which is in their view increased by the guru's encouragement of surrender to him. Alstad and Kramer assert that gurus {{are likely to be}} hypocrites because, in order to attract and maintain followers, gurus must present themselves as purer than and superior to ordinary people and other gurus.|$|E
25|$|The Francis A. Schaeffer Foundation in Gryon, Switzerland {{is led by}} one of {{his daughters}} and sons-in-law as a {{small-scale}} alternative to the original L'Abri Fellowship International, which is still operating in nearby Huemoz-sur-Ollon and other places in the world. Covenant Theological Seminary has established the Francis A. Schaeffer Institute directed by a former English L'Abri member, Jerram Barrs. The purpose of the school is to train Christians to demonstrate compassionately and defend reasonably <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> the claims of Christ on all of life.|$|E
25|$|Even {{among those}} reconstructionist groups who see {{themselves}} {{as part of the}} broader, Pagan or Neopagan spectrum, or who simply see some members of the Pagan community as allies, there is still a refusal to accept or identify with <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> the more problematic aspects of that community, such as the above-noted eclecticism, cultural appropriation or Wiccan-inspired ritual structures. Many Polytheistic Reconstructionists see Reconstructionism as the older current in the Pagan community, and are unwilling to give up this part of their history simply because eclectic movements are currently more fashionable.|$|E
25|$|Other {{scholars}} such as Eddy and Boyd {{state that}} {{there is no evidence of}} a historical influence by outside sources on the authors of the New Testament, and most scholars agree that any such historical influence on Christianity is entirely implausible given that first century monotheistic Galilean Jews would not have been open to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would have <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> pagan stories. The Macmillan Encyclopedia of Buddhism states that theories of influences of Buddhism on early Christianity are without historical foundation.|$|R
40|$|Italian society {{continues}} to be <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> homogeneous in religious terms and the teaching of Catholic religion in state schools as a pillar of the historical and cultural heritage of the Italian population, as sanctioned by the 1984 Concordat between the State and the Catholic Church. But profound changes have since been underway, with migrant families settling {{in the country and}} their Italian-born offspring now attending Italian state schools. How do they feel about religious education at school? How do they view the Italian model of secularism and religious pluralism in Italy? <b>What</b> do <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> Italianness? A qualitative, focus-group-based investigation at secondary schools in a northern Italian town enables us to bring out these students’ demand for change from a generational standpoint and see beyond education into religion to possible ways to educate about and from religions, creating new horizons for religious pluralism (even) in Italy...|$|R
50|$|The {{solar eclipse}} barely discerned {{by the main}} {{characters}} through thick clouds {{at the beginning of}} the film is echoed by summer and fall images of the sun as they present themselves to all of them at various points in the film through a fisherman's net from his pontoon on the Danube beyond the city's suburbs, which Fajolo and Peťo have discovered independently and use as a swimming deck, a place to ponder life, or to try to seduce Bela. When, however, Bela brings her mother and brother Milo (Peter Lobotka) to the pontoon after a series of subdued interpersonal crises, the pontoon is on dry land because the water level has dropped, and the film ends with Bela and Milo lying to their mother about <b>what</b> <b>they</b> can <b>see</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> did about the visibility of the eclipse during the opening sequences.|$|R
25|$|The {{opinions}} of the Talmudic rabbis are divided between those who seek {{the purpose of the}} mitzvot {{and those who do not}} question them. The latter argue that if the reason for each mitzvah could be determined, people might try to achieve <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> the purpose of the mitzvah, without actually performing the mitzvah itself (lishmah), which would become self-defeating. The former believe that if people were to understand the reason and the purpose for each mitzvah, it would actually help them to observe and perform the mitzvah (some mitzvot are given reasons in the Torah).|$|E
25|$|The {{opposition}} badly {{wanted to}} get its story out {{to the rest of}} the world and so, as soon as they acquired a territorial base in Benghazi, foreign reporters were able to join them. These reporters were, to a large extent, free to travel wherever and to talk to whomever they wished within opposition-controlled areas. This proximity and relative freedom of access to the opposition side of events, combined with reporters' natural sympathies for <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> genuine popular rebellions against despotic regimes, undoubtedly aided the opposition and hurt the Gaddafi-government in getting their respective messages out.|$|E
25|$|Askeladd's company finds {{employment}} as mercenaries in the Danish invasion of London. There they face {{off with a}} larger force led by Thorkell the Tall, a fellow Viking. Thorfinn and Thorkell meet in battle, and Askeladd's band flees from <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>as</b> an unwinnable fight. The two forces meet again later, however, when both commanders seek to capture the young Danish Prince Canute. Askeladd succeeds in capturing the prince, but is forced once again to flee from Thorkell's larger army. The company takes refuge for the winter in the frozen north of England near the Danish encampment at Gainsborough.|$|E
50|$|The episcopal heraldic achievement, of bishop's coat of arms, is {{composed}} of a shield, with its charges (symbols), a motto scroll and the external ornaments. The shield, which is the central most important feature of any heraldic device, is described (blazoned) in archaic 12th century terms, and this description is oriented as if being given by the bearer with the shield worn on the arm.: the terms dexter and sinister are thus the reverse of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are <b>as</b> <b>seen</b> from the front.|$|R
6000|$|Now {{our main}} {{argument}} lies in this: {{that the great}} mass of a generation of children born into a country, all those children who have no more than average intelligence and average moral qualities, will accept the ostensible institutions of that country at their face value, and will be almost entirely shaped and determined by that acceptance. Only a sustained undertone of revolutionary protest can prevent that happening. They will believe that precedences represent real superiority, and <b>they</b> will honour <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> honoured, and ignore <b>what</b> <b>they</b> <b>see</b> treated <b>as</b> of no account. Pious sentiment about Equality and Freedom will enter into the reality of their minds {{as little as a}} drop of water into a greasy plate. They will act as little in general intercourse upon the proposition that [...] "the man's the gowd for a' that," [...] as they will upon the proposition that [...] "man is a spirit" [...] {{when it comes to the}} alternative of jumping over a cliff or going down by a ladder.|$|R
50|$|Other {{scholars}} have, however, rejected any influence, e.g. Paula Fredriksen {{states that}} no serious scholarly work places Jesus outside {{the backdrop of}} 1st century Palestinian Judaism. Eddy and Boyd state {{that there is no}} evidence of a historical influence by outside sources on the authors of the New Testament, and most scholars agree that any such historical influence on Christianity is entirely implausible given that first century monotheistic Galilean Jews would not have been open to <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would have <b>seen</b> <b>as</b> pagan stories.|$|R
