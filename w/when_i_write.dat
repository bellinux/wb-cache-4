I wanted the video to have a classic feel; to be seductive but still keep the sense of mystery. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>write,</b> when I perform, and when I make music videos, I don’t hold anything back. 'Dance for You' is about that same passion; to be free and unrestrained.|$|E

500|$|... "The Food Wife" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} producer of The Simpsons Matt Selman. The writing process began around September 2010. According to Selman, the episode mainly revolves around Homer and Marge competing about who is perceived as the most fun by Bart and Lisa, a situation that he thinks parents can identify with in real-life. The episode also focuses heavily on foodies and food blogs. Selman {{said in an interview}} with New York magazine's Grub Street publication that the foodie culture is [...] "just a world that I always thought was funny and fascinating. The idea of food as not only something you enjoy eating, but as something that you are so passionate about that you're kind of bragging about it. 'I'm the one who discovered this particular Korean pork-neck soup restaurant,' and you can kind of claim that as yours. The blogging just feeds into that kind of territorial element that I always thought was inherently funny. And <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> Simpsons episodes, I try to start with a world I think is funny, and think, 'What's a good story we can tell in that world, using the characters that we have?'" ...|$|E
500|$|At French {{television}} show Taratata Gaga appeared while {{hanging out of}} the window of her limousine. She later went on the show to perform [...] "Hair", but changed her outfit once more. The recorded performance was released to her YouTube channel by Gaga. Air Productions, which produces the program Taratata, detected the posting of the video and notified YouTube of supposed copyright infringement on Gaga's part. YouTube was forced to close Gaga's official channel with the statement: [...] "YouTube ladygagaofficial account was closed, because we have received, several instances, third-party notifications informing us that many people, including the following, filed a claim for infringement of copyright: Air Productions." [...] Later, Air Productions issued a statement that the notification was sent in error, and they had asked Google and YouTube to rectify this; Gaga's account was re-opened, and Taratata apologized to the singer: [...] "Really sorry for the problem with YouTube. Everything works again!" [...] During her promotional performances of the songs from Born This Way in Taiwan, Gaga sang [...] "Hair" [...] and played the piano in a black bra, against the backdrop of many red lanterns and a red arch, a set created specially for the Taiwan show. She later explained in a press conference the inspiration behind the performance: [...] "Like the gentleman [...] just mentioned, that lantern means prosperity and it's about the future. I'm always thinking about the future of my generation and the voice of my generation <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> music." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Society Hill" [...] {{was written}} by Matthew V. Lewis and {{directed}} by Kate Woods, most known for directing Looking for Alibrandi and television series such as Phoenix and its spinoff Janus. Daniel Licht {{who has worked on}} the series since its inception, returned to compose the music for the episode. Actress Nadia Dajani (best known for her role in Ned & Stacey) guest starred in the episode as Lauren Matthews. Joanna Cassidy (best known for her role in Six Feet Under) made her first appearance as Joan Hunt, Megan's mother. Cassidy was reportedly originally meant to first appear in the third episode of the first season, [...] "Helping Hand". Series creator Christopher Murphey said of Cassidy's role as Joan, [...] "I get this weird chill <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> scenes for the two of them, it's a wonderful dynamic, I think Megan and her mother have a wonderful back story that we will be basically mining over the first few episode's. You're going to be finding out a lot about Megan". However, even though Cassidy is a recurring cast member, she is credited as being a guest star. Regular cast member Sonja Sohn who plays Detective Samantha Baker, did not appear in this episode and recurring cast members Jeffrey Nordling and Mary Mouser were credited but also did not appear. Some scenes were set in Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, such as the murder.|$|E

Thus, in my records, my [...] "Bank" [...] ledger account has an asset credit balance, which is reduced by the credit for £200. [...] Amounts in my records for the two creditors are liabilities, which are reduced by the two debits totaling £200.|$|E
2500|$|... "I hear {{everything}} at once – melody, lyrics, {{it just comes}} in. There's a feeling that comes over me and I know that there's a song trying to come through. It's sort of like I'm taken over or someone's trying to contact me; I really believe very much that I'm in some ways channeling this thing. Because <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> a song it's always done very quickly, completed in 20minutes or maybe half an hour. I never labour anything, or very rarely. The only labouring I've ever done in songwriting might be when I've completed a work, a song, and {{there might be a}} couple of lyrics I don't like, so sometimes I might sit with those and really put some brain power in how to fix up the lines. But for the most part it comes to me, it comes in and I can hear the whole thing finished with harmonies and everything." [...] Graeham Goble (2001) ...|$|E
2500|$|... "For me, {{there will}} be days <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> a little poem in a little book, or make a little voice memo in my iPhone. For me, I need to be sitting at an {{instrument}} and be overwhelmed. I've tried {{to look back and}} see if a song just came out of a sunny day. [...] "Oh, today I'm going to write a song." [...] That's never been the case for me. It's always whether I'm just overwhelmed with some emotion. Whether it be I'm happy, I'm sad, I've fallen in love, I've fallen out of love. I'm lonely, I'm scared. Whatever it be that day. If I'm like a volcano and I'm about to explode, I better run to an instrument because it's about to come out. For me, I don't really go back. I probably should. I have a bajillion pieces of songs. But I seem to just write in one sitting. There's very few occasions where I've gone back and worked on songs later. Normally, I sit down, the song comes out and I'm done." ...|$|E

2500|$|Murakami's initial {{success with}} Hear the Wind Sing {{encouraged}} him to continue writing. A year later, he published a sequel, Pinball, 1973. In 1982, he published A Wild Sheep Chase, a critical success. Hear the Wind Sing, Pinball, 1973, and A Wild Sheep Chase form the Trilogy of the Rat (a sequel, Dance, Dance, Dance, was written later but is not {{considered part of the}} series), centered on the same unnamed narrator and his friend, [...] "the Rat." [...] The first two novels were not widely available in English translation outside Japan until 2015, although an English edition, translated by Alfred Birnbaum with extensive notes, had been published by Kodansha as part of a series intended for Japanese students of English. Murakami considers his first two novels to be [...] "immature" [...] and [...] "flimsy," [...] and has not been eager to have them translated into English. A Wild Sheep Chase, he says, was [...] "the first book where I could feel a kind of sensation, the joy of telling a story. When you read a good story, you just keep reading. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> a good story, I just keep writing." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to John Richardson in a 2007 Vanity Fair article, [...] "Jason Epstein's {{assessment}} of Silvers as 'The most brilliant {{editor of a}} magazine ever to have worked in this country' has been 'shared by virtually {{all of us who}} have been published by Robert Silvers'". The British newspaper [...] The Guardian called Silvers [...] "the greatest literary editor there has ever been", while Library of America remembered him as [...] "an unsurpassed editor who helped define and sustain the literary and intellectual culture of New York and America". The New York Times described him as [...] "the voracious polymath, the obsessive perfectionist, the slightly unknowable bachelor-workaholic with the colossal Rolodexes and faintly British diction", and, in his obituary, stated that [...] "under his editorship [...] became one of the premier intellectual journals in the United States, a showcase for extended, thoughtful essays on literature and politics by eminent writers." [...] Author Louis Begley wrote, [...] "the ideal editor of my – and I would guess every writer’s – dreams is ... Robert B. Silvers, the editor, brain, and heart of the NYRB. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>write</b> a piece for his magazine, of course I have the immeasurable good luck to be edited by him. [...] There is no experience quite like it. Bob knows everything that's worth knowing, a consequence of his unflagging curiosity." [...] "Bob's edits are scrupulous, comprehensive, and precise. They are frequently aimed at saving the reviewer's face." [...] Roger Cohen wrote, after Silvers' death, [...] "No eye for imprecise thought was ever more discerning; no edit a sharper yet gentler distillation than his. ... He was a stickler for accuracy. The pencil in his hand went {{to the heart of the}} matter." ...|$|E
