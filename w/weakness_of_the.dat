5|$|An attack often {{begins with}} muscle pain, cramping, and stiffness. This is {{followed}} by weakness or paralysis that tends to develop rapidly, usually in late evening or {{the early hours of}} the morning. The weakness is usually symmetrical; the limb muscles closer to the trunk (proximal) are predominantly affected, and weakness tends to start in the legs and spread to the arms. Muscles of the mouth and throat, eyes, and breathing are usually not affected, but occasionally <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respiratory muscles can cause life-threatening respiratory failure. Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days, even in the absence of treatment. On neurological examination during an attack, flaccid <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> limbs is noted; reflexes are usually diminished, but the sensory system is unaffected. Mental status is not affected.|$|E
5|$|Heart: {{cardiomyopathy}} (<b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> heart muscle) {{is a rare}} but recognized {{problem in}} Wilson's disease; it may lead to heart failure (fluid accumulation due to decreased pump function) and cardiac arrhythmias (episodes of irregular and/or abnormally fast or slow heart beat).|$|E
5|$|Injury to the {{accessory}} nerve {{can result in}} neck pain and <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. <b>Weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies {{may be needed to}} confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups.|$|E

5|$|The {{weakness}} from LEMS typically {{involves the}} muscles of the proximal arms and legs (the muscles closer to the trunk). In contrast to myasthenia gravis, the weakness affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position. Weakness is often relieved temporarily after exertion or physical exercise. High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. <b>Weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bulbar muscles (muscles of the mouth and throat) is occasionally encountered. <b>Weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye muscles is uncommon. Some may have double vision, drooping of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing, but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis, in which eye signs are much more common. In the advanced stages of the disease, <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> respiratory muscles may occur. Some may also experience problems with coordination (ataxia).|$|E
5|$|A {{quarter of}} all people with Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} develop <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breathing muscles leading to respiratory failure, the inability to breathe adequately to maintain healthy levels of oxygen and/or {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood. This life-threatening scenario is complicated by other medical problems such as pneumonia, severe infections, blood clots in the lungs and bleeding in the digestive tract in 60% of those who require artificial ventilation.|$|E

5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CVST) is {{the presence}} of acute thrombosis (a blood clot) in the dural venous sinuses, which drain blood from the brain. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> face and limbs {{on one side of the}} body, and seizures. The diagnosis is usually by computed tomography (CT/CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) employing radiocontrast to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses by thrombus.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the poor}} {{performance}} and military <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Song army was observed by the Jurchens, who immediately broke the alliance, beginning the Jin–Song Wars of 1125 and 1127. In the Jingkang Incident {{during the latter}} invasion, the Jurchens captured not only the capital, but the retired emperor Huizong, his successor Emperor Qinzong, {{and most of the}} Imperial court.|$|E
5|$|Next, the {{examining}} physician may check for <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> quadriceps. This examination may reveal fluid in the joint, tenderness, and crepitus. The Wilson test is also useful in locating OCD lesions of the femoral condyle. The test is performed by slowly extending the knee from 90 degrees, maintaining internal rotation. Pain at 30 degrees of flexion and relief with tibial external rotation {{is indicative of}} OCD.|$|E

This second raid was only partially successful, and was followed a year later by a raid on the harbour of Griessie, in which the last Dutch warships in the East were eliminated.|$|E
5|$|The design's lack of {{structural}} integrity {{is seen as}} another significant <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Quad ESL-63 since its inception, and lived on in its various successors. Other shortcomings include very limited sound pressure levels, meaning that it won't play loud, and its bass response was lacking. In addition, one reviewer experienced problems with shut-downs playing music with high intensity bass drums.|$|E
5|$|The first {{symptoms}} of Guillain–Barré syndrome are numbness, tingling, and pain, {{alone or in}} combination. This is followed by <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legs and arms that affects both sides equally and worsens over time. The weakness can take half a day to over two weeks to reach maximum severity, and then becomes steady. In one in five people, the weakness continues to progress {{for as long as}} four weeks. The muscles of the neck may also be affected, and about half experience involvement of the cranial nerves which supply the head and face; this may lead to <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> muscles of the face, swallowing difficulties and sometimes <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eye muscles. In 8%, the weakness affects only the legs (paraplegia or paraparesis). Involvement of the muscles that control the bladder and anus is unusual. In total, about a third of people with Guillain–Barré syndrome continue to be able to walk. Once the weakness has stopped progressing, it persists at a stable level ("plateau phase") before improvement occurs. The plateau phase can take between two days and six months, but the most common duration is a week. Pain-related symptoms affect more than half, and include back pain, painful tingling, muscle pain and pain {{in the head and neck}} relating to irritation of the lining of the brain.|$|E

5|$|Thyrotoxic {{periodic}} paralysis (TPP) is {{a condition}} featuring attacks of muscle weakness {{in the presence of}} hyperthyroidism (overactivity of the thyroid gland). Hypokalemia (a decreased potassium level in the blood) is usually present during attacks. The condition may be life-threatening if <b>weakness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> breathing muscles leads to respiratory failure, or if the low potassium levels lead to cardiac arrhythmias (irregularities in the heart rate). If untreated, it is typically recurrent in nature.|$|E
5|$|Transport in the North {{has been}} shaped by the Pennines, {{creating}} strong north-south axes along each coast and an east-west axis across the moorland passes of the southern Pennines.
