50|$|Ford Super Duty {{trucks were}} built in Brazil, with {{different}} engines than its North American counterparts and fewer options, initially between 1999 and 2011, with a limited reintroduction of the F-350 in 2014. The dual-rear <b>wheel</b> <b>variant</b> of the F-350 is known locally as F-4000. They were widely exported to Australia (F-250 and F-350), South Africa (F-250) and Argentina (F-250, rebadged as F-100, and the F-350 DRW rebadged as F-4000), usually following the Brazilian specification (with an obvious change of the cockpit location in the versions targeted to Australia, South Africa and other RHD markets) but Australia had {{a wider range of}} options in pair with its American counterparts, including automatic transmission and the V8 engines. Supercab extended-cab bodystyle was never officially available in Brazil and regional export markets (Uruguay and Argentina), but was made in RHD for export to Australia. South Africa had only the MWM engine and 5-speed manual transmission, with the option of 2WD and 4WD for the single-cab while the crew-cab had 4WD as standard.|$|E

Steering wheels are the Precision Racing Wheel and the Force Feedback <b>Wheel</b> <b>variants</b> which include throttle and brake pedals.|$|R
50|$|Field {{modified}} variants - Various field modified variants also existed during World War II. There was a kit for installing an armoured map {{table in}} place of the forward MG34 mount in use in 1941. One interesting variant was made at the closing stages of the war, when German forces removed the armored bodies of damaged Sd.Kfz. 251s and installed them on light truck chassis, resulting in a <b>wheeled</b> <b>variant</b> of the Sd.Kfz. 251. At least two were made in this way judging by their number plates.|$|R

5000|$|German {{production}} stopped {{after the}} 1967 model year; however, the T1 still {{was made in}} Brazil until 1975, when it was modified with a 1968-79 T2-style front end, and big 1972-vintage taillights into the so-called [...] "T1.5" [...] and produced until 1996. The Brazilian T1s were not identical to the last German models (the T1.5 was locally produced in Brazil using the 1950s and 1960s-era stamping dies {{to cut down on}} retooling, alongside the Beetle/Fusca, where the pre-1965 body style was retained), though they sported some characteristic features of the T1a, such as the cargo doors and five-stud 205 mm Pitch Circle Diameter rims. Wheel tracks varied between German and Brazilian production and with 14-inch, 15-inch and 16-inch <b>wheel</b> <b>variants</b> but commonly front track varied from 1290 mm to 1310 mm and rear track from 1370 mm to 1390 mm.|$|R

5000|$|The main {{advantages}} of the Haldex Traction LSC system over the Torsen-based system include: a slight gain in fuel economy (due to the decoupling of the rear axle when not needed, thereby reducing driveline losses due to friction), {{and the ability to}} maintain a short engine bay and larger passenger compartment due to the transverse engine layout. A further advantage of the Haldex, when compared to just front <b>wheel</b> drive <b>variants</b> of the same model, is a more balanced front-rear weight distribution (due to the location of the Haldex center [...] "differential" [...] next to the rear axle).|$|R
5000|$|The MG GS is MG's first {{production}} SUV {{launched in}} 2015, with {{sales in the}} UK commencing in June 2016.

The {{top of the range}} model also comes with the option of a 7 speed automatic transmission. The MG GS is also available with a 2.0L Turbocharged 4 Cylinder engine, with 220PS. All wheel drive and the 2.0L engine is not available in the UK however.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Wheel</b> Forward StreetLite <b>variant,</b> {{also known}} as the StreetLite WF, was {{launched}} in 2010. It is available in two lengths of 8.8 m and 9.5 m with seating for up to 33 and 37 passengers respectively. To save space in these variants the axle is positioned ahead of the door which is similar to the Optare Solo midibus.|$|R
5000|$|As of 2010, {{the engine}} range {{consists}} of two 2.0L turbocharged direct injection (TDI) common rail diesel engines which is taken from the Volkswagen Transporter (T5), it has been tuned for more torque but less power; the entry-level version produces [...] which develops a maximum torque of 340 Nm from 2000 rpm. The {{top of the line}} bi-turbo version produces [...] which develops a maximum torque of 400 Nm from 1500 rpm -2500 rpm. Fuel consumption in a combined cycle format is as low as [...] on the rear <b>wheel</b> drive <b>variant</b> to [...] on the 4Motion theoretically giving the Amarok a 1000 km range before filling up for fuel.|$|R
50|$|With the {{exception}} of the UK's <b>Wheeled</b> Tanker <b>variants,</b> all MTVRs are powered by a Caterpillar C-12, Advanced Diesel Engine Management (ADEM) III 11.9-litre six-cylinder diesel engine that develops 425 hp at 1,800 rpm and 2,101 Nm of torque at 1,200 rpm. When the central tire inflation system (CTIS) is set at 0 to 1,814 kg (2 tons) payload, engine power output is automatically reduced by around 20%. Driveline is completed by an Allison HD 4070P seven-speed automatic transmission, TC-541 torque converter and an Oshkosh 30000 Series single-speed transfer case. All-wheel drive is permanent and under highway driving conditions the torque split is 32% front, 68% rear.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{internship}} is threefold. First {{there is}} an assignment to compare two vehicle dynamics simulation software packages, a Simulink two track model provided by the TU/e and a commercial multibody full vehicle model from dSPACE. For this comparison use is made of a chassis tuning project, which {{is also part of}} this internship. The TU/e two track model does not contain kinematics and elasto-kinematics, so the preference is given to the dSPACE multibody model. Another nice feature in this package is the possibility for animation of the simulation results. The second project is a hybrid sportscar project. Here the question is two determine which configuration, rear wheel driven or all wheel driven, is the best choice for converting a current sportscar model to a hybrid variant. The decision is based on a test were the vehicle enters a corner at 50 km/h and starts accelerating full throttle at the beginning of that corner. From the results at the exit of the corner can be concluded that the all <b>wheel</b> driven <b>variant</b> is the faster vehicle. Although the traction control system development was a difficult process and a lot of improvements are still possible, the final settings enable the all <b>wheel</b> driven <b>variant</b> to have an exit speed which is 6 km/h higher than the rear <b>wheel</b> driven <b>variant.</b> Here the recommendation is made to optimize the chassis setup for all wheel drive and preferably to use better front tyres. These measures will even further increase the difference and in the simulations the speed difference at the corner exit increases to 15 km/h. The third and final part of this internship was to simulate the influence of an additional battery pack on the dynamic behaviour of a hybrid vehicle. This hybrid vehicle has to be compared with the original vehicle. Measures are taken to decrease this influence and to make the dynamic behaviour of the hybrid vehicle similar to the that of the original vehicle. The influence of adding the additional battery pack is that the unmodified hybrid vehicle is oversteered more and also has some time delay in the lateral acceleration. The measures taken to reduce these effects are adding 0. 5 degrees negative camber on the rear wheels, increasing the front roll stiffness with 20 % and finally decreasing the rear roll stiffness with 30 %. These measures appear to make the hybrid vehicle behave similar to the original vehicle, but real life tests should be performed to check if these measures suffice and if they are feasible with respect to other characteristics (eg. ride comfort) ...|$|R
40|$|The known {{methods of}} the {{realized}} rate of tyre coefficient of cohesion with the supporting surface at wheel rolling in the brake mode are analysed.
