60|$|<b>What</b> <b>good</b> <b>would</b> that do? No. I've {{done nothing}} to prevent their meeting. I've left them {{absolute}} liberty.|$|E
60|$|DORA. [pitying him: quite {{nice about}} it] <b>What</b> <b>good</b> <b>would</b> that do, old dear? There are others, you know.|$|E
60|$|RICHARD. Well, that's what I meant him to do. <b>What</b> <b>good</b> <b>would</b> his staying have done? They'd {{only have}} hanged us both.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't see <b>what</b> <b>good</b> that <b>would</b> do," [...] she said, {{with some}} relenting toward a smile, {{in which he}} {{instantly}} prepared himself to bask.|$|R
6000|$|... "His family think him fled, as {{was like}} enough, {{considering}} {{the way in}} which they treated him," [...] said Charles. [...] "Nor do I see <b>what</b> <b>good</b> it <b>would</b> do them to know the truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Colonel {{glanced at}} the rifle coolly, as he answered: [...] "I fail to see <b>what</b> <b>good</b> that <b>would</b> do. My {{handwriting}} is peculiar; you couldn't imitate it, while you would certainly be hanged when the troopers laid hands on you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Discharge him! <b>What</b> <b>good</b> <b>would</b> that do? Don't {{you think}} it would be better wisdom to teach him better ways and keep him?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't deride my agony, John. If I had six centuries <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>would</b> it do? How {{could it}} help a poor wretch without name, capital, or friends?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>would</b> your runnin' do?" [...] said Lewis [...] "You'd never ketch me. Why, I {{could give}} you twenty paces start and beat you to yon tree." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{intended}} to arrest you, Mrs. Orme," [...] she remarked; [...] "but, honestly, I can't see <b>what</b> <b>good</b> it <b>would</b> do, while it would cause Mary Louise and the dear Colonel a heap of trouble in prosecuting you. So, unless Miss Jones objects----" ...|$|R
60|$|The old {{man did not}} {{understand}} <b>what</b> <b>good</b> the sword <b>would</b> do, however he took it down, {{and the young man}} went his way.|$|R
6000|$|Why did {{she never}} bethink herself how hard the afflictions were upon Mrs. Lacy, and <b>what</b> <b>good</b> it <b>would</b> have done her if her pupil {{had tried to}} be like a gentle little {{daughter}} to her, instead of merely striving for all the fun she could get? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah never, never! If {{it takes}} that {{to save her}} she must be lost. Besides, <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>would</b> it do? If I were to go above she could come below." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, there isn't," [...] said Peter Rabbit. [...] "And {{if there}} was <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>would</b> it do you? Old Mrs. Chuck would see that tear in your pants and then you'd catch it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{will have}} the large cake,' {{answered}} the youth; 'for <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>would</b> my mother's blessing do for me if I was dying of hunger?' And taking the big cake he went his way.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's fine," [...] replied Shefford, warmly. He {{was glad}} {{for the sake of}} this lonely desert man. <b>What</b> <b>good</b> a wife <b>would</b> bring into a trader's life! ...|$|R
6000|$|But Mrs. MacGlowrie, evading his earnest eyes {{as well as}} his appeal, was {{wondering}} <b>what</b> <b>good</b> it <b>would</b> do either a doctor, or--a--a--she herself seemed to hesitate over the word--"a FRIEND, to hear the worriments of a silly, nervous old thing--who had only stuck a little too closely to her business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{mother must}} have had some reason. I'm sure she must. There isn't a woman in London knows how such things should be done better than my mother. I can write to Lord Rufford and ask him for an explanation; but I do not see <b>what</b> <b>good</b> it <b>would</b> do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What for? For this morning's work? Oh, no! There's no spite in you for that. You forgave me. You saved me. You got {{the better}} of me, too. And anyhow, <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>would</b> it be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{their masters}} can as easily send a {{regiment}} or an army, if they will," [...] replied the lady; [...] "and <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>would</b> your present defence do, excepting to exasperate {{them to your}} utter destruction?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>would</b> that do?" [...] asked Dorothy. [...] "If I got across, it wouldn't {{help the}} rest of you, and I couldn't go alone among all those giants and dragons while you stayed here." ...|$|E
6000|$|The boy thought over <b>what</b> a <b>good</b> knight-errant <b>would</b> do in such case, {{and then}} answered, [...] "Tell you what: I'll fight you for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'At this tree. I {{was just}} {{thinking}} <b>what</b> <b>good</b> snowshoes it <b>would</b> make,' answered the fox in an absent voice, {{as if he was}} not thinking of what he was saying.|$|R
6000|$|The {{minister}} rose. [...] "Then I really mustn't detain you, I suppose. Good-bye." [...] He {{offered his}} hand. Colville took it, {{but could not}} let it go at once. [...] "I would like extremely {{to tell you why}} I'm leaving Florence in such haste. But I don't see <b>what</b> <b>good</b> it <b>would</b> do, for I don't want you to persuade me to stay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} talk about her. <b>What</b> <b>good</b> <b>would</b> it do? You cannot at any rate be {{surprised}} at my extreme anxiety. You did promise your uncle most solemnly that you would never marry this young lady." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hush! <b>What</b> <b>good</b> <b>would</b> that do? A boy like you? Unless {{they took}} you in hand {{to make you}} a traitor, and offered you your lands if you would swear {{allegiance}} to King Edward, as he calls himself.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{can they}} take you, if you won't go? And {{if you should}} go, <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>would</b> it do, if you were only to find me here when you came back, {{just the same as}} you left me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Their {{feathers}} make soft beds," [...] asserted Pessim. [...] "And my skin {{would make}} excellent drumheads," [...] retorted the Ork. [...] "Nevertheless, a plucked bird or a skinned Ork {{would be of}} no value to himself, so we needn't brag of our usefulness after we are dead. But {{for the sake of}} argument, friend Pessim, I'd like to know <b>what</b> <b>good</b> you <b>would</b> be, were you not alive?" ...|$|R
60|$|He had a fixed idea, I guessed {{by several}} {{observations}} he let fall, that, as his nephew resembled him in person, he would resemble him in mind; for Linton's letters bore {{few or no}} indications of his defective character. And I, through pardonable weakness, refrained from correcting the error; asking myself <b>what</b> <b>good</b> there <b>would</b> be in disturbing his last moments with information that he had neither power nor opportunity to turn to account.|$|R
6000|$|... "I expect {{they mean}} {{to stay here}} and hold the country," [...] Edgar said. [...] "I don't know <b>what</b> <b>good</b> it <b>would</b> do to them; still I suppose they think it would, or they would not take the trouble to come over. But if they should take the country, it would be very bad for men like my father, for they would be sure to put all the English in prison, and it would be the ruin of their business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr Cupples is right, lads," [...] {{said the}} captain; [...] "we'd {{have no chance}} in a fair fight, an' though I make no doubt we should kill double our number in the scrimmage, <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>would</b> that do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a figure, Fothergill. <b>What</b> <b>good</b> <b>would</b> it do? None to me, {{and none}} to you either, as I take it. If there is {{anything}} wrong, Potter's fellows will find it out. What is it the duke wants?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I didn't mean forgetting in that way. I {{dare say}} if I were to die you would {{remember}} me right enough. And <b>what</b> <b>good</b> <b>would</b> that be to anybody? It's while I am alive that I want--" ...|$|E
6000|$|When {{the report}} came to Miss Silence's ears that Deacon Enos {{considered}} himself as aggrieved by her father's will, she held forth upon {{the subject with}} great strength of courage and of lungs. [...] "Deacon Enos might be in better business than in trying to cheat orphans out of their rights--she hoped {{he would go to}} law about it, and see <b>what</b> <b>good</b> he <b>would</b> get by it--a pretty church member and deacon, to be sure! getting up such a story about her poor father, dead and gone!" ...|$|R
50|$|Elsewhere, Lycus sneaks {{into the}} cells and finds Amphion tied up. He tells Amphion {{that even if}} he has to deny {{everything}} he believes in to saves himself then he should do it. Amphion asks him <b>what</b> <b>good</b> it <b>would</b> do to turn away from all that he believes in. Back at the caves, Hercules, Iolaus and Leah camp for the night. Hercules asks Leah if Hestia will lead them to the cave and Leah tells them she cannot be certain. While Hercules goes to keep watch, Leah tells Iolaus how she came to be a Hestial Virgin.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{very glad}} I {{can help to}} beguile them for you. Now {{tell me what you}} {{honestly}} think of my work? Criticism is always valuable, and I should really like yours, Mrs. Basset," [...] said Randal, wondering <b>what</b> the <b>good</b> woman <b>would</b> make of the delicate analysis and worldly wisdom on which he prided himself.|$|R
