5|$|Abi {{gets her}} job back at The Queen Vic and celebrates with Lauren and Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Lee's {{pregnant}} fiancée. Abi drunkenly confesses to Lauren about her one-night stand with Lee, so she urges Abi {{to confess to}} Whitney, as Whitney has caught chlamydia from Lee. Abi does so but this results in much resentment. Babe emotionally blackmails Abi, forcing her to resign. Abi exposes Babe's secrets to the pub's landlord, Mick Carter (Danny Dyer) with Whitney defending her, so he tells Abi that she can keep her job, but this causes tension when she is later threatened by Babe. However Abi struggles to work on her own and so Linda Carter (Kellie Bright) is forced to ask Babe back to help her. Abi then persistently bickers about an order and lack of hygiene so blames it on Babe. Angry with Abi's behaviour, Linda sacks her. Abi locks Babe in the kitchen freezer room {{as an act of}} revenge, although Babe frames her sister Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe) who she strongly dislikes and has Alzheimer's disease. Abi is then reinstated at the Vic by a seemingly apologetic Babe but her behaviour, when alone in the kitchen with Abi, is threatening. Babe later leaves Walford after being thrown out by her family, so Abi runs the kitchen alone. Abi forms a friendship with Donna Yates (Lisa Hammond) when she moves in with Ben and Jay, and Donna convinces Abi to move in as well, though she feels bad about leaving Dot on her own, but Dot gives her blessing when Donna reveals that Abi <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> out. Abi is inwardly resentful of Lauren's success and, following Lauren's secret abortion of which Abi was made aware, Abi tells Lauren's partner, Steven Beale (Aaron Sidwell) that they would make a good couple during a heart-to-heart, but he tells her she is too young to be a mother. On Father's Day, feeling second best to Lauren and wound up during an argument with Steven, Abi reveals the abortion. Lauren is jealous when her boss, Josh Hemmings (Eddie Eyre), flirts with Abi, which leads to an argument, with Abi throwing a drink over her sister and then evicting her from the party. Later, the tension simmering between Abi and Steven leads to them having sex, even though he warns her it will mean nothing. Abi and Steven continue an affair and Abi learns that Steven is lying about having a brain tumour so that Lauren will not leave him. Despite being against the idea, Abi does not tell Lauren as Steven promises Abi he is planning to leave Lauren to be with her. Then Abi is stunned by Steven's public marriage proposal to Lauren. Jane Beale (Laurie Brett) overhears Abi and Steven talking about their relationship and confronts them. Abi then discovers she is pregnant by Steven.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that labour supply – especially of partnered women with supplemental incomes – is positively associated with homeownership status. This literature is advanced by testing whether <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> into homeownership before the actual entry into homeownership affects individuals’ labour supply in couples. The empirical analysis is based on longitudinal data from the British Household Panel Survey (1991 – 2008). Fixed-effects panel regression models are used to predict the labour supply of women and men separately. Labour supply changes associated with homeownership are found to mainly occur when individuals <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> into homeownership and prior to the actual entry into homeownership. When <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> into homeownership, women and men increase their labour supply, where {{women are more likely to}} take up work and men to increase work hours. For women, the association between <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> into homeownership and labour supply is moderated by regional house price changes...|$|R

25|$|At UMass Amherst, only freshmen are {{required}} to live on campus. Housing {{is open to all}} full-time undergraduate students, regardless of year. Upper-class students who have continuously lived on campus during their first and sophomore years are guaranteed housing as long as they choose to live on campus. If, however, a student is admitted after their sophomore year, or moves off campus, and <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> back onto campus, they are not guaranteed housing, but instead must go through a housing lottery, since demand outstrips supply. Housing assignments are accomplished by a complex process that takes into account building seniority as well as class year; those choosing to move from their building are subject to a lottery system. There are approximately 12,000 students living on campus.|$|E

30|$|As {{discussed}} in Sect. 2, {{who would not}} <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> and take all services and information with no loss of quality of experience? The rapid {{growth in the number}} of mobile devices puts support mobility as one of key issues in future Internet design. The requirement is to comprehensively support user, terminal, service, application, virtual network, information, and other real and virtual entity mobility. The challenge behind this idea justifies why unique identifiers are needed: it is because we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> real or virtual entities as well as information, without loss of identity, and we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> continue finding them during and/or after movement. People <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> without loss of identity and functionality. Services and applications need to follow users as they move.|$|R

25|$|Most mesopelagic fish make daily {{vertical}} migrations, {{moving at}} night into the epipelagic zone, often following similar migrations of zooplankton, {{and returning to}} the depths for safety during the day. These vertical migrations often occur over a large vertical distances, and are undertaken {{with the assistance of}} a swimbladder. The swimbladder is inflated when the fish <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> up, and, given the high pressures in the messoplegic zone, this requires significant energy. As the fish ascends, the pressure in the swimbladder must adjust to prevent it from bursting. When the fish wants to return to the depths, the swimbladder is deflated. Some mesopelagic fishes make daily migrations through the thermocline, where the temperature changes between 10 and 20°C, thus displaying considerable tolerances for temperature change.|$|E

He instructs his lawyers to announce his death, that the entire fortune has gone to charity, and Jack has been left penniless. Jack is turned out of his rooms and shunned by his rich friends. Among the very poor, whom he formerly despised, he is treated as a comrade.
