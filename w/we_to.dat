5|$|After {{all that}} has been said and done, what are <b>we</b> <b>to</b> make of Lloyd George’s legacy as a war leader? On the home front he {{achieved}} varied results in tackling difficult, and in some instances, unprecedented problems. It {{would be hard to}} have improved on his dealings with labour and the program to increase homegrown food, but in the sectors of manpower, price control and food distribution he adopted the same approach as his predecessor, taking action only in response to the changing nature of the conflict. In the vital area of national morale, while {{he did not have the}} technical advantages of Churchill, his personal conduct damaged his ability to do more to inspire the nation. All things considered, it is unlikely that any of his political contemporaries could have handled matters at home as effectively as he did, although it can be argued that if someone else had been in charge, the difference would not have been sufficient to change the final outcome. In his conduct of the war he did advance the cause of the Entente significantly in some ways, but in determining strategy, one of the most important tasks for which a prime minister must be responsible, he was undeniably a failure. To sum up, while Lord George's contributions outweighed his mistakes, the margin is too narrow, in my opinion, to include him In the pantheon of Britain's outstanding war leaders.|$|E

500|$|Ó Corrain {{also offers}} {{argument}} against the identification of Ímar and Ingvar/Ivar: [...] "To take but one example, if Ivarr of Dublin is identical with Inguar, how are <b>we</b> <b>to</b> give any credence to Smyth's reconstruction of Brompton (p. 229) which shows Ivarr in East Anglia in 871 when we know from contemporary Irish sources that Ivarr of Dublin was besieging Dumbarton for four months in 870 and returned to Ireland in early 871 with the takings?... Taken all together, the genuine material on Inguar in contemporary English sources is slight". He also states [...] "there is nothing new in the suggestion that Ímar of Dublin and Igwar/Ingwar/Iuuar of English history are identical. It has frequently been put forward....and has equally frequently been rejected or treated as a mere possibility". Downham concludes [...] "while medieval writers {{seem to have been}} as interested as modern historians about Ívarr’s origins, it is perhaps wiser to accept that {{we do not know what}} these really were".|$|E
500|$|However, {{there is}} no precise point at which an object {{can be said to}} have reached {{hydrostatic}} equilibrium. As Soter noted in his article, [...] "how are <b>we</b> <b>to</b> quantify the degree of roundness that distinguishes a planet? Does gravity dominate such a body if its shape deviates from a spheroid by 10 percent or by 1 percent? Nature provides no unoccupied gap between round and nonround shapes, so any boundary would be an arbitrary choice." [...] Furthermore, the point at which an object's mass compresses it into an ellipsoid varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object. Objects made of ices, such as Enceladus and Miranda, assume that state more easily than those made of rock, such as Vesta and Pallas. Heat energy, from gravitational collapse, impacts, tidal forces, or radioactive decay, also factors into whether an object will be ellipsoidal or not; Saturn's icy moon Mimas is ellipsoidal, but Neptune's larger moon Proteus, which is similarly composed but colder because of its greater distance from the Sun, is irregular. In addition, the much larger Iapetus is ellipsoidal but does not have the dimensions expected for its current speed of rotation, indicating that it was once in hydrostatic equilibrium but no longer is.|$|E

500|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in The Guardian, Steve Jones, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, gave his perspective on the Kaycee Nicole case. Jones credits the anonymity of the Internet for impeding people's abilities to realize when someone is lying: [...] "Given the mutability of identity, how are <b>we</b> <b>to</b> negotiate social relations that, at least in the realm of face-to-face communication, were fixed by recognition of identity?" [...] Online interaction has only been possible since the 1980s, steadily growing over the years. After analyzing several cases of online deception and interaction, social theorists Adam Joinson and Beth Dietz-Uhler write in a 2002 Social Science Computer Review article that deception on the Internet is a paradox: the faceless nature of online communications not only gives opportunity to the unscrupulous and attention-seekers, but also allows earnest users to express themselves more freely, representing a truer version of themselves. Typically, Internet deception takes the form of changing one's sex or presenting one's own idealized image of oneself. Joinson and Dietz-Uhler cite a chapter in Network and Netplay, in which researchers note the purpose of some forums is to allow their members to participate in a kind of online party, affording chances to pretend and perform: [...] "the type of play on the Internet is usually allowed only in children or adults during masked balls or carnivals". More practical issues such as age, location, marital status, and occupation are also frequently changed online, or left ambiguous to preserve users' privacy or continue identity play.|$|E
500|$|Rutter {{inserted}} {{an anonymous}} English poem from the 15th century, Of a Rose, a lovely Rose, {{as the second}} movement. Marked [...] "Tranquil and flowing", it imitates chant singing, with flexible times and in doric mode. The poet imagines Jesus as a rose springing from Mary, comparable to [...] "". She {{is seen as a}} rose bush with five branches: the Annunciation, the Star of Behlehem, the three Kings, the fall of the devil's power, and heaven. The last stanza asks Mary to “shield us from the fiendes bond”. The eight stanzas, in four lines of which three rhyme, are set as variations of an old tune. The short refrain is first sung by the soprano alone, immediately repeated by soprano, alto and tenor, the voices in unison but for triads on [...] "lovely". It is repeated after the first stanza by soprano and tenor in unison. After the fourth stanza, it appears again, now in three different parts, and a last time before the final prayer, again slightly different. The first stanza ("... this rose began to spring ...") is sung by the bass, the second ("... out of her bosom ...") by the alto, the third ("... an angel from heaven's tower ...") by two sopranos and alto, the fourth ("... star shone over Bethlehem ...") by tenor and bass, the fifth ("... three kinges ...") by the bass, the sixth ("... sprang to hell ...") by four parts SATB, the seventh ("... sprang to heaven ...") by soprano and alto, the final prayer ("Pray <b>we</b> <b>to</b> her ...") by four parts again but mostly in unison.|$|E

[...] Davis was not impressed by Morrison, but not out of disdain or any preconceived notions, but rather because Morrison's professional comportment generally did not meet Davis's expectations. [...] "No prep, no meeting," [...] recalls Davis. [...] "He was remote from us, 'cause he came in and went into a booth... And that's where he stayed, isolated in a booth. I don't think he ever introduced himself to us, nor <b>we</b> <b>to</b> him... And he seemed very shy..." [...] Drummer Connie Kay later told Rolling Stone that he approached Morrison and asked [...] "what he wanted me to play, and he said to play whatever I felt like playing. We more or less sat there and jammed." [...] Morrison's impression of the sessions was [...] "The songs came together very well in the studio. Some of the tracks were first takes. [...] the musicians were really together. Those type of guys play what you're gonna do before you do it, that's how good they are." [...] He told Ritchie Yorke that only two tracks recorded during the sessions did not make it to the album. [...] "One was about Jesse James and the other about trains. They were both just basic blues numbers. That's why they didn't fit in with the album." ...|$|E

Crash Bandicoot - Time Line ] |publisher=Naughty Dog |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }} Programmers Andy Gavin, Stephen White and Greg Omi created three new gameplay engines for the game. Two of the three new engines were three-dimensional in nature and were created for the airplane and jet-ski levels; the third new engine was created for the motorcycle levels in the style of a driving simulator. The new engines combined make up a third of the game, while the other two-thirds of the game consist of the same engine used in the previous games. Jason Rubin explained that the [...] "classic" [...] engine and game style was preserved due {{to the success of the}} previous two games and went on to say that [...] "were <b>we</b> <b>to</b> abandon that style of gameplay, that would mean that we would be abandoning a significant proportion of gamers out there." [...] An arbitrary plane z-buffer was created for the jet-ski and flooded Egyptian hallway levels of the game.

A real shadow was given to the Crash character at the request of the Sony Computer Entertainment America producers, who were [...] "sick of that little discus that's following him around." [...] To create an [...] "arcade" [...] experience in the airplane levels and to differentiate them from flight simulators, the enemy planes were programmed to come out in front of the player and give the player ample time to shoot them before they turn around and shoot the player rather than come up behind the player and hit them from behind.
