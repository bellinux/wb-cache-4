5|$|There {{have been}} several {{theories}} proposed for why the phylloxera was ignored as the possible cause of the disease {{that resulted in the}} failure of so many vineyards, most of which involve the feeding behaviour of the insect, and the way it attacks the roots. The proboscis of the grape phylloxera has both a venom canal from which it injects its deadly venom and a feeding tube through which it takes in vine sap and nutrients. As the toxin from the venom corrodes the root structure of a vine, the sap pressure falls and, as a result, the Phylloxera quickly withdraws its feeding tube and searches for another source of food. Thus, anyone digging up a diseased and dying vine <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> Phylloxera clinging to the roots of the plant.|$|E
5|$|In season six, it is {{revealed}} that Jenny is dead. The series then reverts {{three months before}} the incident, picking up from the previous series finale. Shane's ex-girlfriend Molly Kroll (Clementine Ford) gives Jenny a letter of apology addressed to Shane. Jenny hides the letter so Shane <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> it. Tina defends Jenny after the original film reels of Lez Girls are stolen, preventing the film from being released. Jenny later starts a relationship with Shane. Jenny steals Alice Pieszecki's (Leisha Hailey) ideas for a play which sparks a feud between the pair. Alice tries to convince everyone that the ideas were hers. Jenny keeps up the pretense and convinces everyone it is an original idea. Alice tries to break Shane and Jenny up to no avail. Jenny then reveals to Dylan Moreland (Alexandra Hedison) that Helena Peabody (Rachel Shelley) and the rest of their friends are setting her up to find out if she is in love with Helena or her money. Jenny starts teasing Max by buying him feminine gifts for his pregnancy. This alienates Shane and is worsened by her trust issues involving Shane's fidelity. Shane sleeps with Niki once more and their relationship reaches a breaking point. Helena later finds out that Jenny revealed the truth to Dylan. This makes Helena desperate for revenge on her old friend. Tina and Shane later find Molly's letter in the loft. Tina then finds the stolen originals of Lez Girls and she goes to confront Jenny.|$|E

25|$|He {{extensively}} discusses playwright Molière's work, {{and uses}} the play Le Misanthrope to exemplify a comedy in which the audience derives immoral pleasure. In the play, the main character, Alceste, is good and honest in his relationships with men and made to look ridiculous, whereas Philinte, a deceiver and manipulator, is shown as superior. Rousseau considers this play to be a work of genius, but it is, of course, morally backwards. He reasons that even if comedy writers write a play that is morally acceptable, the audience <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> it funny. Therefore, theatres are of little use.|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} wonder {{in the region}} which is called Ercing. A tomb is located there next to a spring which is called Licat Amr; {{and the name of}} the man who is buried in the tomb was called thus: Amr. He was the son of Arthur the soldier, and Arthur himself killed and buried him in that very place. And men come to measure the grave and find it {{sometimes}} six feet in length, sometimes nine, sometimes twelve, sometimes fifteen. At whatever length you might measure it at one time, a second time you <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> it to have the same length – and I myself have put this to the test.|$|E
25|$|Buffett {{viewed the}} United States' {{expanding}} trade deficit as {{a trend that}} will devalue the US dollar and US assets. He predicted that the US dollar will lose value in the long run, {{as a result of}} putting a larger portion of ownership of US assets in the hands of foreigners. In his letter to shareholders in March 2005, he predicted that in another ten years' time the net ownership of the U.S. by outsiders would amount to $11 trillion. Americans... would chafe at the idea of perpetually paying tribute to their creditors and owners abroad.

[...] Ben Kenigsberg of The Village Voice said the film is [...] "not without its moments of elemental dread [...] also obviously padded, too long on action, and painfully short on irony.

[...] Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer said that [...] "those who want something more substantial from a movie than a vid-game script with centerfold appeal <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> it in this noisy, bone-crushing survivalist flick."

Initially he has appeared to come close to an admission, saying in 1992, [...] "in December 1970, I signed three or four documents" [...] to escape from the secret police. In his 1987 autobiography A Way of Hope, Wałęsa said, [...] "It is also the truth that I had not left that clash completely pure. They gave me a condition: signature! And then I signed." [...] He denies he acted upon the collaboration agreement. However, in his later years Wałęsa said all the documents are forgeries and told BBC in 2008, [...] "you <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> any signature of mine agreeing to collaborate anywhere".|$|E

500|$|By 1566, Nostradamus's gout, {{which had}} plagued him painfully {{for many years}} and made {{movement}} very difficult, turned into edema, or dropsy. In late June he summoned his lawyer to draw up an extensive will bequeathing his property plus 3,444 crowns (around $300,000 US today), minus a few debts, to his wife pending her remarriage, in trust for her sons pending their twenty-fifth birthdays and her daughters pending their marriages. This was followed by a much shorter codicil. On the evening of 1 July, he is alleged to have told his secretary Jean de Chavigny, [...] "You <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> me alive at sunrise." [...] The next morning he was reportedly found dead, lying {{on the floor next to}} his bed and a bench (Presage 141 [...] for November 1567, as posthumously edited by Chavigny to fit what happened). He was buried in the local Franciscan chapel in Salon (part of it now incorporated into the restaurant La Brocherie) but re-interred during the French Revolution in the Collégiale Saint-Laurent, where his tomb remains to this day.|$|E
500|$|Bates's {{occasional}} {{hints at}} Darwinian evolution are unwelcome or misunderstood by the reviewer, as when Bates writes {{that if a}} kind of seed is found in two places, we have to [...] "come to the strange conclusion" [...] it has been created twice unless we can show it can be carried that far; but the reviewer finds Bates in [...] "too great a hurry to come to conclusions" [...] (sic). The reviewer, too, objects to Bates's illustration of [...] "transition forms between Heliconius Melpomene and H. Thelxiope, which he thinks are no more different than [...] "a couple of Dorking hens". Bates's assumption that all forest animals are adapted to forest life is rejected by the reviewer, who sees the same features as signs of a beneficent Creator; while his mention of [...] "slow adaptation of the fauna of a forest-clad country throughout an immense lapse of geological time" [...] is criticised for being [...] "haunted" [...] by this [...] "spectre of time". However the reviewer is fascinated by the variety of life described in the book, and by Bates's [...] "rapturous manner" [...] of speaking about how delicious monkey flesh is, which [...] "almost puts a premium on cannibalism". The review concludes [...] "not without regret" [...] (at such an enjoyable book), and assures readers [...] "that they <b>will</b> <b>not</b> <b>find</b> him heavy reading"; supposes that 11 years was [...] "perhaps a little too much" [...] of tropical life; and recommends intending museum curators to try it for [...] "a year or two".|$|E

2500|$|The box of dust {{enabling}} travel between worlds {{originated in}} Atlantis. Both Lewis and his close friend J.R.R. Tolkien were {{fascinated by the}} Atlantis legend.

The world of Charn was destroyed when Jadis spoke The Deplorable Word, a form of knowledge ancient Charnian scholars feared for its destructive potential. A number of commentators believed Lewis was referring {{to the use of the}} atomic bomb, used less than a decade earlier. It is perhaps more likely that Lewis was echoing the mythical destruction of Atlantis by the forces of evil and arrogance.
