5|$|In addition, most {{researchers}} have speculated {{as to why}} Sydney <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> to an unknown vessel, with various levels of blame assigned to Captain Burnett for the demise of his ship. Theories to explain Burnett's actions include that he was inexperienced or incompetent, deceived by Kormorans disguise, {{the idea that he}} was under conflicting orders instructing that raiders be attacked at range but enemy supply ships be captured, or {{that he was trying to}} clearly identify the merchantman.|$|E
5|$|The 1992 primary <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> {{it forced}} a recount and {{prompted}} a lawsuit. When Ohio Secretary of State Bob Taft dismissed Miller's charges of voting irregularities in Highland, Hocking and Warren counties, Miller {{filed suit in}} the Ohio Supreme Court. Miller dropped his court challenge in August and then only because his campaign treasury was exhausted. In the final count, McEwen won 33,219 votes to Miller's 32,922, a plurality of 297 votes. In the end, McEwen's geographic advantage (he retained 59% of his old territory) put him over the top. Ominously, however, Miller trounced him in the five counties {{that had been in}} Miller's old district.|$|E
5|$|The race <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> {{that one}} early vote count had the {{candidates}} tied at 77,225 votes each. Absentee ballots decided the election; ballots were accepted until April 13.

Tedisco conceded the race the following day, and Murphy {{was sworn in}} on April 29. Democratic electoral successes in November 2008 and Murphy's clear support of the stimulus package were credited for his success.|$|E

5|$|Because Stuyvesant <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> to the World Trade Center site, {{there were}} {{concerns}} of asbestos exposure. The US EPA indicated {{at that time}} that Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos, and conducted a thorough cleaning of the Stuyvesant building, but the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association has contested the accuracy of the assessment. Some problems, including former teacher Mark Bodenheimer's respiratory problems, have been reported—he accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases include Stuyvesant's 2002 Class President Amit Friedlander, who received local press coverage in September 2006 after he was diagnosed with cancer. While there have been other cases linked to the same dust cloud that emanated from Ground Zero, a spot precariously close to Stuyvesant, there is no definitive evidence that such cases have directly affected the Stuyvesant community. Stuyvesant students did spend a full year in the building before the theater and air systems were cleaned, however, and a group of Stuyvesant alumni is currently lobbying for health insurance as a result.|$|E
5|$|In June 1108 Ralph succeeded Gundulf as Bishop of Rochester, {{having been}} {{nominated}} by Gundulf before his death. Ralph was consecrated on 9 August 1108. He was at Anselm's deathbed in April 1109, and, afterwards, Ralph acted as {{administrator of the}} see of Canterbury until 26 April 1114, when he was chosen Archbishop at Windsor. The king had wanted his doctor, Faricus, who was an Italian and Abbot of Abingdon, but the nobles and the bishops objected to anyone but a Norman being appointed. The bishops also desired someone {{who was not a}} monk, or at least not one who <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> to Henry. As a compromise, Ralph was chosen, rather than the secular clergy that the bishops favoured. Although Ralph was a monk and had not served as a royal clerk, he was also a bishop, which seems to have reconciled the other bishops to his selection.|$|E
5|$|Other {{candidates}} in the Democratic field included sitting lieutenant governor Thelma Stovall, Terry McBrayer (the choice of sitting governor Julian Carroll), congressman Carroll Hubbard, state auditor George Adkins, and Louisville mayor Harvey Sloane. Initially the leading candidate, Stovall was hampered during the campaign by ill health. During the campaign, Brown was attacked by McBrayer for refusing to release his federal tax returns. McBrayer also claimed that Brown had not voted in a Democratic primary since 1975, a charge validated by public voting records. Nevertheless, Brown won the primary {{by a margin of}} 25,000 votes. The race <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> that Sloane, Brown's closest competitor, refused to concede for two days. Brown defeated former Republican governor Louie B. Nunn in the 1979 general election by a vote of 554,083 to 376,809.|$|E

5|$|Stanford's post-score kickoff was downed for a touchback, and Virginia Tech's offense began {{from its}} 20-yard line. The Hokies gained their initial first {{down of the}} game when quarterback Tyrod Taylor {{completed}} a 19-yard pass to wide receiver Danny Coale on the drive's third play, but Tech was unable to gain another. Tech punted from its 43-yard line, and the kick was downed at the Stanford 5-yard line, where the Cardinal offense started work. Two rushing plays were stopped for no gain, then Luck attempted a passing play on third down. Because {{the line of scrimmage}} <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> to the Stanford goal line, Luck had to move into his own end zone to attempt the pass. Under pressure from the Virginia Tech defense, he threw to Derek Hall, who caught the ball in the end zone and was tackled before getting out. The result of the play was a safety, a 2-point defensive score for Virginia Tech.|$|E
5|$|The next {{race was}} the Monaco Grand Prix, where Caracciola was again entered as a semi-independent. He ran fourth {{early in the}} race, but moved to second as Alfa Romeo driver Baconin Borzacchini pitted for a wheel change and the axle on Achille Varzi's Bugatti broke. Tazio Nuvolari, in the other Alfa Romeo, found his lead reduced rapidly as Caracciola closed in; with ten laps {{remaining}} in the race Caracciola <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> he could see Nuvolari changing gears. He finished the race just behind Nuvolari. The crowd jeered Caracciola: they believed he had deliberately lost for the team, denying them a fight for the win. However, {{on the strength of}} his performance, Caracciola was offered a full spot on the Alfa Romeo team, which he accepted.|$|E
5|$|U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps {{set a new}} Olympic {{record of}} 50.58 to defend his title in the event, edging out Serbia's Milorad Čavić (50.59) by one {{hundredth}} of a second (0.01). He also earned his seventh Olympic gold at a single Games, tying Mark Spitz's 1972 record for the most gold medals. Australia's Andrew Lauterstein earned a bronze in 51.12, finishing in a close race against world record holder Ian Crocker by the slimmest margin. Phelps' triumph occurred after Čavić had remarked {{that it would be}} better for the sport if Phelps was defeated. Phelps' margin of triumph <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> that the Serbian team filed a protest, but after officials reviewed the video, the International Swimming Federation (FINA) announced that Phelps did touch the wall first and his victory would be upheld.|$|E

5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation found}} a {{simulated engine failure}} procedure was being conducted, which involved {{a member of the}} crew pulling back the throttle lever for engine No. 4 prior to taking off. Investigators found that if the throttle lever was pulled back too far, it would cause the propeller to reversea feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing. Once the landing gear was raised, the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position, since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. 4 engine, thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank. Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not raised, that increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine, causing the DC-6 to spiral out of control. Since the plane <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> to the ground, the suddenness of the bank and dive meant the flight crew had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact.|$|E
5|$|Bennett {{declined}} the offer to be Dole's running mate but suggested Kemp, a man described as Dole's antagonist. On August 16, 1996, the Republican Party chose Kemp as its vice presidential , running alongside former Senator Dole. Kemp {{was seen as}} a means to attract conservative and libertarian-minded voters like those of tough nomination-challengers Forbes and Pat Buchanan. Kemp was chosen over Connie Mack, John McCain, and Carroll Campbell, and it is assumed that this was partly because Kemp had several former staffers in influential positions as Dole's senior advisors. Dole had had a long history of representing the budget-balancing faction of the Party, while Kemp had had a long history of representing the tax-cutting advocates, and Kemp's tax-cutting fiscal track record was seen as the perfect fit for the ticket. When Kemp became Dole's running mate in 1996, they appeared {{on the cover of the}} August 19, 1996 issue of Time magazine, but the pair barely edged out a story on the reported discovery of extraterrestrial life on Mars, which <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> to being the cover story that Time inset it on the cover and wrote about how difficult the decision was.|$|E
5|$|Roquebert {{had learned}} the correct signals for Spanish {{shipping}} from captured Spanish merchant ships and, having lured Junon within range, opened a destructive fire from Renommée that caused severe damage to Junons rigging. Unable to manoeuvere away from the French due to the damage suffered in the opening broadside, Shortland returned fire {{as best he could}} while closing with Renommée to inflict maximum damage. As Junon closed with the flagship, Clorinde attacked her from the other side and the flûtes took up stations fore and aft, repeatedly raking the British ship. Observateur had been some distance behind Junon when the action began, and was thus not directly engaged by any of the French ships. Wetherall initially fired at Clorinde from extreme range, but soon recognised that he could do nothing to aid Junon in the face of overwhelming French numbers and so sailed westward to find and warn other British ships of the approaching French squadron. As Observateur escaped, Junon was pounded from all sides, Roquebert's ship coming so close to the British frigate that their rigging tangled and they collided, inflicting further damage. The French squadron <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close</b> to Junon that the soldiers carried aboard for the garrison on Guadeloupe were able to fire their muskets at the British top deck, killing many of the sailors manning the guns.|$|E

5|$|Scott County {{was formed}} {{by an act of}} the Wisconsin Territorial {{legislature}} in 1837. Both Davenport and its neighbor Rockingham campaigned to become the county seat. The city with the most votes from Scott County citizens in the February 1838 election would become the county seat. On the eve of the election, Davenport citizens acquired the temporary service of Dubuque laborers so they could vote in the election. Davenport won the election {{with the help of the}} laborers. Rockingham supporters protested the elections to the territorial governor, on the grounds the laborers from Dubuque were not Scott County residents. The governor refused to certify the results of the election. A second election was held the following August. To avoid another import of voters, the governor set a 60-day residency requirement for all voters. Davenport won by two votes. Because the margin of victory <b>was</b> <b>so</b> <b>close,</b> a third election was held in the summer of 1840. As the August election drew nearer, Rockingham residents grew tired of the county seat cause. Davenport easily won the third election. Consequently, to avoid questions about the county seat, Davenport quickly built the first county courthouse.|$|E
