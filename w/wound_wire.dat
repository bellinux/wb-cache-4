5000|$|During World War I the United Kingdom {{delivered}} a QF 4 inch Mk V naval gun, serial No.974 to Italy {{to act as}} a template for licensed production by the Ansaldo Company. The Mark V was constructed of a tapered inner A tube, A tube, taper <b>wound</b> <b>wire,</b> full-length jacket and breech ring. [...] It had either a horizontal or vertical sliding breech block, with semi-automatic action and used fixed quick-fire ammunition. There were three models produced: Schneider-Armstrong Model 1917, Schneider-Armstrong Model 1919, and Schneider-Canet Model 1917; each with differing mounts and elevations. Overall the 102/45 was considered a successful design and it was widely used on destroyers of the Italian Navy before and during World War II. The exception being the Schneider-Armstrong Model 1919 which was an unsatisfactory twin mount with both guns sharing a common cradle. The Model 1919 was later replaced by single mounts during the war. [...] The 102/45 {{was in the process of}} being replaced by the Cannon 120/45 and 120/50 when World War II began. Starting in 1937 guns that were removed from ships were mounted on new dual-purpose shore mounts and used as anti-aircraft guns and coastal artillery until retired in 1945.|$|E

50|$|Glow plugs {{are used}} for {{starting}} as well as continuing the power cycle. The glow plug consists of a durable, mostly platinum, helically <b>wound</b> <b>wire</b> filament, within a cylindrical pocket in the plug body, exposed to the combustion chamber. A small direct current voltage (around 1.5 volts) {{is applied to the}} glow plug, the engine is then started, and the voltage is removed. The burning of the fuel/air mixture in a glow-plug model engine, which requires methanol for the glow plug to work in the first place, and sometimes with the use of nitromethane for greater power output and steadier idle, occurs due to the catalytic reaction of the methanol vapor to the presence of the platinum in the filament, thus causing the ignition. This keeps the plug's filament glowing hot, and allows it to ignite the next charge. Since the ignition timing is not controlled electrically, as in a spark ignition engine or by fuel injection, as in an ordinary diesel, it must be adjusted by the richness of the mixture, the ratio of nitromethane to methanol, the compression ratio, the cooling of the cylinder head, the type of glow plug, etc. A richer mixture will tend to cool the filament and so retard ignition, slowing the engine, and a rich mixture also eases starting. After starting the engine can easily be leaned (by adjusting a needle valve in the spraybar) to obtain maximum power. Glowplug engines are also known as nitro engines. Nitro engines require a 1.5 volt ignitor to light the glow plug in the heat sink. Once primed, pulling the starter with the ignitor in will start the engine.|$|E
50|$|The Bowden {{mechanism}} {{was invented}} by Irishman Ernest Monnington Bowden (1860 to April 3, 1904) of 35 Bedford Place, London, W.C. The first patent was granted in 1896 (English Patent 25,325 and U.S. Pat. No. 609,570), and the invention {{was reported in the}} Automotor Journal of 1897 where Bowden's address was given as 9 Fopstone Rd, Earls Court. The principal element of this was a flexible tube (made from hard <b>wound</b> <b>wire</b> and fixed at each end) containing a length of fine wire rope that could slide within the tube, directly transmitting pulling, pushing or turning movements on the wire rope {{from one end to the}} other without the need of pulleys or flexible joints. The cable was particularly intended for use in conjunction with bicycle brakes, although it had the potential for other applications. The Bowden Brake was launched amidst a flurry of enthusiasm in the cycle press in 1896. It consisted of a stirrup, pulled up by the cable from a handlebar mounted lever, with rubber pads acting against the rear wheel rim. At this date bicycles were fixed wheel, additional braking being offered by a 'plunger' brake pressing on the front tyre. The Bowden offered extra braking power still, and was novel enough to appeal to riders who scorned the plunger arrangement, which was heavy and potentially damaging to the (expensive) pneumatic tyre. The problem for Bowden was his failure to develop effective distribution networks and the brake was often incorrectly, or inappropriately fitted, resulting in a good number of complaints being aired in the press. Its most effective application was on those machines fitted with Westwood pattern steel rims which offered flat bearing surfaces for the brake pads.|$|E

40|$|The {{different}} ways in which industries are described and researched using historical or archaeological evidence are highlighted. The differing pictures which emerge for the production of small <b>wound</b> <b>wire</b> headed copper alloy pins in England the late- and post-medieval period are used to exemplify the problem. The historical records indicate a turbulent industry, with initially localized craft manufacture in English towns, being swamped from the sixteenth century by a wave of imports from the continent. However, the world's major pin producing industry was subsequently founded in organized semi-automated manufactories which evolved in England during the eighteenth century. This picture contrasts with the archaeological evidence of a slow typological development of the pin head form, and gradual reduction in the pin's metrical parameters. A similar gradual development is noted in the elemental composition of the copper alloy from which the pins were made. No archaeological evidence of imports is discernible, though the changes in manufacturing technique are clearly recorded. The need to evolve a more rounded picture of industries using a variety of forms of evidence is thus emphasized...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{method is}} {{presented}} for including motional and eddy current effects when analytically modeling electrical impedance functions of cylindrical magnetostrictive transducers. To approximate eddy current effects, one-dimensional analytical constant parameter linear electromagnetic models of a cylindrical magnetostrictive transducer are developed. Maxwell's equations are solved for {{the magnetic field}} strength {{as a function of}} radial position. Closed form expressions for magnetic flux as a function of radial position are then derived, from which transducer electrical impedance functions are formulated. Two different physical models of the transducer are considered. The first model results in the classic eddy current solution for a rod in a <b>wound</b> <b>wire</b> solenoid. The second physical model includes the effects of a conducting external cylindrical housing. Motional effects are incorporated into the electromagnetic models via the magnetomechanical model, which is a frequency and load dependent, complex valued expression for the "dynamic magnetic permeability " of the magnetostrictive material within the transducer. The functional form for this dynamic magnetic permeability is derived by comparing the transduction equations for the magnetostrictive material with those for the transducer containing the material. Electrical impedance functions for both physical models are compared with an experimental measurement for a particular magnetostrictive transducer (using Terfenol-D) in its lo...|$|E

40|$|The Far Infrared (FIR) filter for the ISOPHOT partial {{experiment}} of the ISO satellite (Infrared Space Observatory) {{must meet}} {{a wide variety}} of different requirements, and {{the same is true for}} the FIR polarizers. A filter concept developed under this project is presented in detail. It permits flexible ''tailoring'' of band passes within the overall wavelength range 200 #mu#m > #lambda# > 30 #mu#m, i. e. according to user demands, narrower or broader band passes for any central wavelength #lambda#_C. The filters in accordance with this concept are rugged and pass all qualification tests (including multiple cooling cycles and vibration tests) undamaged. They offer the user high transmission values within the pass range with simultaneous high suppression in the rejection ranges. In the case of FIR polarizers one makes recourse to the concept of <b>wound</b> <b>wire</b> meshes, because only in this way and by means of a single element become favorable optical properties (high transmission for parallel polarization, low transmission for cross polarization) available within the entire FIR range.

40|$|NASA has a {{need for}} {{lightweight}} high performance magnets to be used in propulsion systems involving plasmas. We report the design, construction, and testing of a six inch diameter by twelve inch long solenoid using high purity aluminum wire operating at a temperature of 77 Kelvin (K) for the current carrying element. High purity aluminum is the material of choice because of three properties that make it optimal for magnetic construction. At 77 K high purity aluminum has one of the lowest resistivities at 77 K of any metal (p = 0. 254 muOMEGA-cm), thus reducing the power requirements for creating magnetic fields. Aluminum is a low-density (2. 6989 g/cc) material and the end product magnet will be of low total mass compared to similar designs involving copper or other elements. The magneto-resistance of aluminum saturates at low magnetic fields and does not increase indefinitely {{as is the case in}} copper. The magnet consists of four layers of closely <b>wound</b> <b>wire</b> and is approximately 150 mm in diameter by 300 mm long. A cylinder made from G - 10 was machined with a spiral groove to hold the high purity Al wire and the wire wound on it.

The magneto-resistance of the coil has been measured at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL), Tallahassee, FL in externally applied fields to 10 tesla. Following these tests it was energized to the full 2 tesla field it can produce using the facilities of the NHMFL at the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

40|$|An {{engineering}} {{investigation into}} the dynamics and vibrations of magnetostrictive transducers is conducted. The transducers are examined from a linear systems perspective. The system input is electric current. The system output is displacement. A comparison is made between the classic low-signal linear transduction equations for the material and those for the electromechanical transducer containing the material. A magnetomechanical model is derived assuming the magnetostrictive rod behaves as a linear spring. The model is an expression for the complex valued, frequency, coupling, and load dependant magnetic permeability of the magnetostrictive material within the transducer. One-dimensional analytical constant parameter linear electromagnetic models of cylindrical magnetostrictive transducers are derived for the steady state, oscillating magnetic field strength {{as a function of}} radial position, electric current, and excitation frequency, H(r,l,[omega]). The first electromagnetic model is the classic solution for a cylindrical conducting rod in a <b>wound</b> <b>wire</b> solenoid. The second electromagnetic model is for cylindrical transducers with an external conducting cylindrical housing. Both models neglect end effects. The results are electromagnetic-magnetomechanical models of cylindrical magnetostrictive transducers including both the effects of eddy currents occurring within the transducer 2 ̆ 7 s components and dynamic effects. The models are formulated to calculate electrical impedance functions, Z[subscript]ee([omega]), as would be measured at the electric terminals of the transducers when run in their linear range of operation with a known load. Both models simulate the distinctive characteristics of a coupled electromechanical system, i. e., large variations with frequency occur in the electrical impedance magnitude and phase near the mechanical resonant frequency. Numerically disabling dynamic effects allows the calculation of what would be the blocked electrical impedance of the transducers, Z[subscript]e([omega]). Knowledge of Z[subscript] ee([omega]) and Z[subscript] e([omega]) allows calculation of the transduction coefficients, including the effects of eddy currents and the mechanical load connected to the transducer. From there, quantities of engineering interest can be calculated. Comparisons are made between experimental measurements and model simulations of transducer electrical impedance functions, and transducer displacement from current frequency response functions. Simulations of impedance and displacement were typically ± 10...|$|E
40|$|The {{uncertainty}} {{in the frequency of}} a linear-ion-trap frequency standard (LITS) can be reduced substantially by use of a very small magnetic inhomogeneity tailored to compensate for the residual second-order Doppler shift. An effect associated with the relativistic time dilatation, one cause of the second-order Doppler shift, is ion motion that is attributable to the trapping radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic field used to trap ions. The second-order Doppler shift is reduced by using a multi-pole trap; however it is still the largest source of systematic frequency shift in the latest generation of LITSs, which are among the most stable clocks in the world. The present compensation scheme reduces the frequency instability of the affected LITS to about a tenth of its previous value. The basic principles of prior generation LITSs were discussed in several prior NASA Tech Briefs articles. Below are recapitulated only those items of basic information necessary to place the present development in context. A LITS includes a microwave local oscillator, the frequency of which is stabilized by comparison with the frequency of the ground state hyperfine transition of 199 Hg+ ions. The comparison involves a combination of optical and microwave excitation and interrogation of the ions in a linear ion trap {{in the presence of a}} nominally uniform magnetic field. In the current version of the LITS, there are two connected traps (see figure) : (1) a quadrupole trap wherein the optical excitation and measurement take place and (2) a 12 -pole trap (denoted the resonance trap), wherein the microwave interrogation takes place. The ions are initially loaded into the quadrupole trap and are thereafter shuttled between the two traps. Shuttling ions into the resonance trap allows sensitive microwave interrogation to take place well away from loading interference. The axial magnetic field for the resonance trap is generated by an electric current in a finely <b>wound</b> <b>wire</b> coil surrounded by magnetic shields. In the quadrupole and 12 -pole traps, the potentials are produced by RF voltages applied to even numbers (4 and 12, respectively) of parallel rods equally spaced around a circle. The polarity of the voltage on each rod is opposite that of the voltage on the adjacent rod. As a result, the amplitude of the RF trapping field is zero along the centerline and increases, with radius, to a maximum value near the rods...|$|E
