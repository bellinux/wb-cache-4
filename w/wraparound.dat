5|$|A Stage Play titled LIVE IMPACT was {{announced}} on the <b>wraparound</b> jacket band on Volume 21. It {{was scheduled to}} run from July 28 to September 3, 2017. The Stage Play was cancelled {{after one of the}} staff members being involved in an accident.|$|E
5|$|The uniform worn for {{practicing}} aikido (aikidōgi) {{is similar}} to the training uniform (keikogi) used in most other modern martial arts; simple trousers and a <b>wraparound</b> jacket, usually white. Both thick ("judo-style"), and thin ("karate-style") cotton tops are used. Aikido-specific tops are available with shorter sleeves which reach to just below the elbow.|$|E
5|$|The cover art for Amazing {{had been}} largely {{supplied}} by Ed Valigursky during the late fifties, but during the early sixties a much wider variety of artists appeared, including Alex Schomburg, Leo Summers and Ed Emshwiller. Frank Paul, who had painted all the covers {{for the first few}} years of Amazing, contributed a <b>wraparound</b> cover for the April 1961 35th anniversary issue; this was his last cover art for a science fiction magazine.|$|E

40|$|Abstract　This paper {{deals with}} {{performance}} evaluation of an eight-neighbor mesh-connected processor array, {{in which each}} processor has eight links, that is degree 8. We obtain l 0 performance measures for the array in two cases of without <b>wraparounds</b> and with <b>wraparounds</b> (that is a torus), and then compare with the four-neighbor mesh-connected processor array and the binary n-cube. As a results, we conclude that (1) the eight-neighbor mesh-connected processor array basically has properties as a lattice {{as well as the}} four-neighbor mesh-connected one, (2) the torus is superior to the binary n-cube if the number of processors is not so large, but it is inferior if the number of processors becomes large. A critical number exists between 128 and 256, (3) depending on performance measures, some properties of the array without <b>wraparounds</b> are better than ones of the four-neighbor mesh-connected array with <b>wraparounds,</b> but the others are worse...|$|R

5|$|The game {{world is}} {{presented}} in a horizontal <b>wraparound</b> and consists of three platforms which Jetman can manoeuvre onto. Jetman must assemble his rocket (which spawns in instalments scattered around the map), and then fill it with fuel before taking off to the next planet, where the procedure is broadly repeated. In addition, the player has to defend themselves from the planet's aliens, and for bonus points collect valuable resources which occasionally fall from above.|$|E
5|$|As some warmer air {{began to}} move in above the surface, the snow mixed with and changed to sleet and {{freezing}} rain between 6 PM and 7 PM EST on the 13th in Philadelphia and Delaware Counties, then between 7 PM and 11 PM across most other areas in eastern Pennsylvania. The southern Poconos saw less mixed precipitation, however {{there was a period}} of mixed precipitation between about 7:30 PM on the 13th and 11:30 AM on the 14th. For a brief time during the afternoon of the 14th, temperatures rose a couple of degrees above freezing with no precipitation falling. Temperatures then dropped below freezing again by the late afternoon of the 14th with a period of snow before the precipitation came to an end between 8:30 PM and 10 PM on the 14th. <b>Wraparound</b> snow showers lingered in Monroe and Carbon Counties until 2 AM EST on the 15th.|$|E
5|$|In Computer Space, {{the player}} {{controls}} a rocket as {{it attempts to}} shoot a pair of flying saucers while avoiding enemy fire. The monochrome game has the three ships flying on a two-dimensional plane, set {{against the backdrop of}} a starfield. Missiles are fired one at a time, and there is a cooldown period between launches. The player's rocket follows Newtonian physics, remaining in motion even when the player is not accelerating, though the rocket can rotate at a constant rate without inertia. The flying saucers stay in place or glide in a zig-zag pattern around the screen in tandem, with one staying a constant distance directly below the other. If a ship or missile moves past one edge of the screen, it reappears on the other side in a <b>wraparound</b> effect. While the missile is in flight, the player can turn it left or right by turning their rocket.|$|E

5|$|The {{main body}} of most {{clarinets}} is divided into the upper joint, the holes and most keys of which are operated by the left hand, and the lower joint with holes and most keys operated by the right hand. Some clarinets have a single joint: on some basset horns and larger clarinets the two joints are held together with a screw clamp and are usually not disassembled for storage. The left thumb operates both a tone hole and the register key. On some models of clarinet, such as many Albert system clarinets and increasingly some higher-end Boehm system clarinets, the register key is a 'wraparound' key, with the key {{on the back of}} the clarinet and the pad on the front. Advocates of the <b>wraparound</b> register key say it improves sound, and it is harder for moisture to accumulate in the tube beneath the pad. Nevertheless, there is a consensus among repair techs that this type of register key is harder to keep in adjustment, i.e., it is hard to have enough spring pressure to close the hole securely.|$|E
5|$|The {{first issue}} of If was dated March 1952, with Fairman as editor; it {{featured}} stories by Richard Shaver, Raymond Palmer, and Howard Browne, all writers who were regulars of the Ziff-Davis magazines. By the time the third issue reached the news stands, the disappointing sales figures for the first issue were in, and Quinn decided to let Fairman go. Quinn persevered with himself as editor. His first issue was dated July 1952, and he continued as editor on the masthead for some years. Quinn brought in Ed Valigursky as the art editor; he designed striking covers, including some <b>wraparound</b> artwork—an unusual feature—which helped improve circulation. Quinn began searching for a replacement editor: writer Lester del Rey turned down the job (a decision he {{is reported to have}} later regretted), but Quinn was able to engage Larry T. Shaw, an active science-fiction fan who had sold a few stories. Shaw joined in May 1953 as associate editor and soon began writing editorials (beginning with the September 1953 issue) and assisting with story selection. The magazine's quality quickly improved and soon Quinn felt able to switch to a monthly schedule, instead of bimonthly. Shaw left after only a year, and Quinn resumed full editorial responsibilities.|$|E

50|$|Each episode {{explores the}} comical mishaps of Mickey and his {{associates}} running the club, which are used as <b>wraparounds</b> for Disney cartoons (some of which are classic theatrical cartoons from the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, but {{most of which are}} reruns from Mickey Mouse Works).|$|R
25|$|The final {{generation}} of the Oldsmobile Ninety-Eight coincided with its 50th anniversary in 1991. The added length, rear fender skirts, wide tail, low nose, and split-grille with <b>wraparound</b> headlights gave this generation Ninety-Eight a more distinctive appearance than its predecessor.|$|E
25|$|The {{house is}} {{significant}} {{as one of}} the most well-preserved Queen Anne structures in Stambaugh. It is a two-story, cross-gable house with clapboard siding, patterned shingling in the gables, stained glass transom windows, and a <b>wraparound</b> front porch with Tuscan columns.|$|E
25|$|Robinson Park is an 11-acre park on Mt. Juliet Rd. (next to Robinson Crossing). It hosts a ½ mile <b>wraparound</b> {{hiking trail}} and outdoor fitness equipment. The park offers homes to birds, bees, bats, lady bugs, and butterflies. Robinson Park is a Certified Wildlife Habitat.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, {{producer}} Fred Ladd acquired {{a large number}} of NASA documentary short subjects and packaged them as 110 five-minute episodes. Inexpensive animated <b>wraparounds,</b> featuring the inquisitive Little Adam and his older brother Wilbur, were added to open and close the segments.|$|R
50|$|The Splits' segments, {{including}} songs-of-the-week {{and comedy}} skits, served as <b>wraparounds</b> {{for a number}} of individual segments. In the second season, The Three Musketeers segments were replaced with repeats of The Hillbilly Bears, a cartoon segment that previously appeared on The Atom Ant Show (1965-1968).|$|R
50|$|It covers {{their years}} {{working for the}} Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio and then the history of Hanna-Barbera Productions which {{was set up in}} 1957.

25|$|Postwar Cadillac {{vehicles}} innovated {{many of the}} styling {{features that}} came to be synonymous with the late 1940s and 1950s American automobile. Incorporating many of the ideas of then General Motors styling chief Harley J. Earl, these included tailfins, <b>wraparound</b> windshields, and extensive use of chrome.|$|E
25|$|To {{the north}} of the church is the parsonage, built a few years later. Its main block is similar in form and {{materials}} to the church. It adds a two-story western wing with a <b>wraparound</b> flat-roofed porch, supported by turned posts on the rear. Its interior finishes are original.|$|E
25|$|However, {{when a team}} is {{washed out}} a goal on a <b>wraparound</b> due to the referee 'losing sight of the puck' as it went round the net, there isn't much to be done. GB battled desperately hard under {{some of the worst}} refereeing ever seen in an {{international}} competition.|$|E
5000|$|Tom & Jerry Halloween Special is a 1987 animated/live action {{television}} {{special that}} aired in primetime on TBS. This holiday special was a spin-off of a programming block entitled [...] "Tom and Jerry's Funhouse on TBS". The Halloween Special's <b>wraparounds</b> were live action segments hosted by Josh Jarboe and Audra Lee, two youths dressed in various Halloween costumes.|$|R
50|$|Webster {{began his}} {{broadcast}} career with Fox Soccer Channel (then Fox Sports World) in May 2000. His first assignment of note was writing the copy for Lionel Bienvenu and the highly popular Premier League Review Show. By 2004, Webster {{was the voice}} of the English Premier League as he provided the majority of the <b>wraparounds</b> for the world's most popular league.|$|R
500|$|The {{first four}} Treehouse of Horror episodes had brief <b>wraparounds</b> that {{occurred}} before each segment and loosely tied together all three stories. [...] "Treehouse of Horror" [...] {{was the only}} one that actually included a treehouse as a setting. In that episode, Bart and Lisa sat in it telling stories to each other. [...] "Treehouse of Horror II" [...] presented all of the segments as being nightmares of Lisa, Bart and Homer; [...] "Treehouse of Horror III" [...] had Lisa, Bart and Grampa telling stories at a Halloween party; and [...] "Treehouse of Horror IV" [...] is presented by Bart in a parody of Rod Serling's Night Gallery. After a few years, the amount of broadcast time for an episode was shortened, allowing less time to tell a proper story. There were no <b>wraparounds</b> for [...] "Treehouse of Horror V" [...] because they had been cut to make more time for the segments. Following that, the writers permanently dropped them.|$|R
25|$|The shape, size, {{and style}} of windows and doors {{throughout}} the Washington Harbour complex were highly variable. Windows were single in some places, and horizontal ribbons in others. <b>Wraparound</b> windows often adorned corners, and sliding glass or French doors were sometimes used in place of windows. Windowsills, too, varied in color, height, material, shape, and style.|$|E
25|$|The Sturgeon {{house is}} a -story Queen Anne house with a {{projecting}} cross-gable roof and a conical turret. A large Tuscan-column <b>wraparound</b> porch with balustered railing runs across the front. The house contains windows with colored glass lights, intricate interior woodwork, and the original paneling and lighting fixtures. The exterior finish has been covered with asphalt siding and asbestos shingles.|$|E
25|$|The {{formerly}} opened ground-floor arcades {{were filled}} with brick walls; the new space housed altars from thirteen former wooden churches erected {{on the site of}} Ivan's executions in Red Square. Wooden shelters above the first-floor platform and stairs (the cause of frequent fires) were rebuilt in brick, creating the present-day <b>wraparound</b> galleries with tented roofs above the porches and vestibules.|$|E
500|$|Using a {{glass wall}} for the entrance, similar in {{appearance}} to his Louvre pyramid, Pei coated {{the exterior of}} the main building in white metal, and placed a large cylinder on a narrow perch to serve as a performance space. The combination of off-centered <b>wraparounds</b> and angled walls was, Pei said, designed to provide [...] "a sense of tumultuous youthful energy, rebelling, flailing about".|$|R
50|$|During {{this era}} of Full Moon, Band secured a weekly {{television}} series on the Sci Fi Channel called William Shatner's Full Moon Fright Night. Veteran actor William Shatner hosted Full Moon films with <b>wraparounds,</b> as well as interviews with many of sci-fi's most notable personalities, including Stan Lee and Jeffrey Combs. Tempe also received exposure here as HorrorVision was included in this short-lived series.|$|R
50|$|These {{were first}} {{made in the}} 1960s as {{variants}} of the Aviator model, used by Yoko Ono and Clint Eastwood in the Dirty Harry films. The modern variant surged in the mid-1980s, heavily based on the then-popular Wayfarer, but adapting it to a more futuristic look. As a backlash against 80s fashion occurred in the 1990s, <b>wraparounds</b> {{became one of the}} favorite frames of the decade.|$|R
