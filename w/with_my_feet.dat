2500|$|James Taylor {{was born}} in Burrough on the Hill, a small village in Leicestershire. His father, Steve, was a National Hunt jockey until injury forced him to retire {{and he is now}} a race starter. Standing 5 feet 1 inches tall, Taylor is known for his {{diminutive}} height {{and is one of the}} shortest cricketers to have [...] played English county cricket., though he is one inch taller than Sachin Tendulkar. [...] He believes that his batting is not weakened by his height and has said [...] "It's good for hooking, and less can go wrong <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> movement. I use it to my advantage as I like to cut and pull." [...] Taylor attended Maidwell Hall and then Shrewsbury School where he studied his A-levels and played for their cricket team.|$|E
60|$|I could but cross {{myself and}} tremble for having {{polluted}} that ground <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet.</b>|$|E
6000|$|I moved not <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet,</b> but mid the glooms Pierced with my charmed eye, contemplating [...] 35 The mighty {{multitude}} of fresh May blooms ...|$|E
60|$|The appalling roar held me spellbound <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot</b> in the stirrup. It drew my glance even in {{that moment}} of flight.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{treat her}} friends badly," [...] said I, kicking the long {{tail of the}} coatimundi away <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot,</b> and regretting that I had joined in his repast.|$|R
6000|$|... "No. If I had spurned {{her from}} me <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot,</b> {{she would not}} have thought so. She had {{condemned}} herself, and therefore I should have spared her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To be sure I'm a-goin' {{to go to}} work--soon as I'm fit. But I can't do nuthin <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> an' {{my stomach}} goin' back on me, can I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Don't {{try to do}} {{anything}} like that, Bunny Rabbit, for I'm {{a good deal more}} spry <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> than ever grandfather was, and I'd catch you on the fly.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Ormsgill smiled. [...] "There {{is nothing}} very wrong <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet,</b> and I haven't had {{a dose of}} fever for some time. It isn't your fault that you have one now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Mark! I'm stuck--I'm stuck! I can't {{reach it}} <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot!</b> I'm {{swinging}}!" [...] And {{he saw that}} she WAS swinging by her hands and the cord.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let that suffice you, Rodenard," [...] I said, {{touching}} him <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot.</b> [...] "See that I {{never set}} eyes upon you again, if you cherish your miserable life!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay! why shouldst thou call to thy god {{on behalf}} of a tyrant and a coward," [...] she said excitedly; [...] "thou shouldst have seen that man cowering at <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> like a beaten dog. I could have spurned him <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot,</b> as I would a cur." ...|$|R
6000|$|I coasted down, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> up, and {{a slight}} breeze just cooling me. Mr. Hitchcock, behind, called out, full-throated, from his seat, 'No hurry! No flurry! Take your time! Take--your--time, miss!' ...|$|E
60|$|Rather ostentatiously, I stepped forward, {{crackling}} some dead branches <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> as I did so. John turned. Luckily, {{he took it}} {{for granted}} that I had only just come upon the scene.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am ready}} to own that," [...] Osgod agreed. [...] "I like to fight <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> on firm ground, and should make but a poor figure {{balanced}} {{on the top of}} a ladder." ...|$|E
60|$|From {{under her}} brows her woman {{glanced at me}} inquisitively; her liveried page, his nose in the air, eyed me so pertly that I was hard put to it not to hasten <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot</b> his descent of the steps.|$|R
6000|$|Suleiman-bin-Daoud {{heard one}} {{say to the}} other, 'I wonder at your {{presumption}} in talking like this to me. Don't {{you know that if}} I stamped <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot</b> all Suleiman-bin-Daoud's Palace and this garden here would immediately vanish in a clap of thunder.' ...|$|R
60|$|So saying, I drew my sword like lightning, {{and giving}} a 'ha! ha!' and a stamp <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot,</b> lunged {{within an inch}} of Fitzsimons's heart, who started back and turned deadly pale, while his wife, with a scream, flung herself between us.|$|R
6000|$|... "No; at Dutton Shaw, {{sitting on}} a log, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> in a swamp. But we've found out where the old spring is, and we're going to pipe it down to Gale Anstey next year." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{brought a}} quarter of a saddle to Colonel Clark, but he smiled at them kindly and told them to divide it amongst the weak. He looked at me as I sat <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> crossed on the stump.|$|E
6000|$|... (Now that is {{graceful and}} handsome. I {{take off my}} hat to my life-long friend and comrade, and <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> {{together}} and my fingers spread over my heart, I say, {{in the language of}} Alabama, [...] "You do me proud.") ...|$|E
60|$|I yawned with prodigious sonority, and {{overturned}} a chair <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot.</b> Then bracing {{myself for}} the ordeal, through which I looked to what scant information I possessed and my own mother wit, to bear me successfully, I strode across to admit my visitor.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{wish you}} {{joy of the}} milk-blooded coward, Cathy!' said her friend. 'I {{compliment}} you on your taste. And that is the slavering, shivering thing you preferred to me! I would not strike him <b>with</b> <b>my</b> fist, but I'd kick him <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot,</b> and experience considerable satisfaction. Is he weeping, or {{is he going to}} faint for fear?' ...|$|R
60|$|I had not, as I said above, touched {{anything}} in the shop, and seeing a glimpse of somebody running over to the shop, I had so much presence of mind as to knock very hard <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot</b> {{on the floor of}} the house, and was just calling out too, when the fellow laid hands on me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tell me," [...] Deane persisted, [...] "if {{things should}} {{go wrong with}} me, or if you had met me simply as a struggler, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> upon the early rungs of the ladder,--tell me, could you have cared then, do you think?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But there isn't any plant," [...] I rapped {{back with}} the edge of the sole of my shoe against the grating--I was in the jacket at the time and so could talk only <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet.</b> [...] "I don't know {{anything}} about the damned dynamite." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{write these}} few lines {{on a fast}} train that is {{carrying}} me back to New York, a cool, comfortable train, with a deserted club-car where I can sit in a leather arm-chair, <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> up on another, smoking, silent, and at peace.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then my boot was in {{the mouth}} of one, and in a moment he and I were in a heap with the canvas {{fluttering}} down on the top of us. I fancy I dashed out his brains <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot.</b> I expected nothing more than to be brained myself by the other two, but the poor heathen had never heard of Baldwin, and incontinently bolted.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am a man}} of my word," [...] said he, [...] "and had need to be so, or I {{would not}} touch this bottle <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot.</b> Well, I shall get my {{schooner}} and a dollar or two for my pocket; and then I will be rid of this devil as fast as I can. For {{to tell you the}} plain truth, the look of him has cast me down." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I laughed, {{and thought}} ill of him. He {{was such a}} fidget! I was only a boy. I {{considered}} him absurdly and unnecessarily particular. He had stalked on a yard or two in front. I loitered behind, and out of pure boyish deviltry, as I was just above Michael's Crag, I loosened some stones <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot</b> and showered them over deliberately. Oh, heavens, I feel it yet; how they rattled and rumbled! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am passionately {{anxious to}} stand upon Mount Sinai," [...] {{continued}} Miss Dawkins; [...] "to press <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> the earliest spot in sacred history, {{of the identity}} {{of which we are}} certain; to feel within me the awe- inspiring thrill of that thrice sacred hour!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't have my feet out," [...] {{retorted}} Jupiter. [...] "Besides," [...] he added, with dignity, and a burlesque {{of marital}} special pleading which every wife and husband recognised, [...] "I always sit <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> out so, and I always will, {{so long as}} I've {{the spirit of a}} god." ...|$|E
60|$|Still, in {{the course}} of an hour, I {{followed}} the sound, or imagined so, from a point straight in line <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>feet</b> to one at right angles with my head. Finally deciding it came from Shep, and fancying he was trailing a deer or coyote, I tried to go to sleep again.|$|E
6000|$|K. Ferd. <b>With</b> <b>my</b> Castilian <b>foot</b> I'll {{meet his}} rage; [...] [Is going out: Shouts within are heard,--Victoria! [...] Victoria! But these loud clamours better news presage.|$|R
60|$|April 22. When I {{began to}} put my resolutions in practice, I was stopt for want of tools and {{instruments}} to work <b>with.</b> Most of <b>my</b> axes and hatchets were useless, occasioned by cutting the hard timber that grew on the island. It took me up a full week to make my grind-stone of use to me, and at last I found {{out a way to}} turn it about <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot,</b> by help of a wheel and a string.|$|R
60|$|Freddie {{stood looking}} at the pile of clothes {{on the floor and}} I knew what he was thinking. To get the kid undressed had been simple--a mere matter of muscle. But how were we to get him into his clothes again? I stirred the pile <b>with</b> <b>my</b> <b>foot.</b> There was a long linen {{arrangement}} which might have been anything. Also a strip of pink flannel which was like nothing on earth. We {{looked at each other and}} smiled wanly.|$|R
