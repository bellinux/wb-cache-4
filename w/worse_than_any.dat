5|$|To crown {{all this}} , {{what is left}} but the amphitheatre? And this disgrace of the city you have as well—Gracchus not {{fighting}} as equipped as a Mirmillo, with buckler or falchion (for he condemns—yes, condemns and hates such equipment). Nor does he conceal his face beneath a helmet. See! he wields a trident. When he has cast without effect the nets suspended from his poised right hand, he boldly lifts his uncovered face to the spectators, and, easily to be recognized, flees across the whole arena. We can not mistake the tunic, since the ribbon of gold reaches from his neck, and flutters in the breeze from his high-peaked cap. Therefore, the disgrace, which the Secutor had to submit to, in being forced to fight with Gracchus, was <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> wound.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, {{industrial}} production was only at 58% of the 1929 level, the second {{lowest level in}} the world after the United States, and well behind nations such as Britain, which only saw it fall to 83% of the 1929 level. Total national income fell to 55% of the 1929 level, again <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> nation other than the U.S.|$|E

Total national income fell to 56% of the 1929 level, again <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> nation apart from the United States.

500|$|Butler devoted much of {{his second}} year to {{executing}} arrest warrants, cracking down on crooked police and enforcing prohibition. On January 1, 1926, his leave from the Marine Corps ended and the President declined {{a request for a}} second extension. Butler received orders to report to San Diego and he prepared his family and his belongings for the new assignment. In light of his pending departure, Butler began to defy the mayor and other key city officials. On the eve of his departure, he had an article printed in the paper stating his intention to stay and [...] "finish the job". The mayor was surprised and furious when he read the press release the next morning and demanded his resignation. After almost two years in office, Butler resigned under pressure, stating later that [...] "cleaning up Philadelphia was <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> battle I was ever in." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the game}} was to retain the same engine, the {{developers}} could not add new gameplay features. Campbell instead {{set out to make}} the levels more interesting, creating multiple paths through the missions. More obvious solutions would be more difficult, and the hidden, [...] "proper" [...] paths easier to execute once deduced. While Campbell intended the game to be harder, he also wished to improve the difficulty curve, which he argued was a flaw of its predecessor. He also tended to make the levels smaller and reduced instances of water obstacles, which he regarded as frustrating in the first game. The designer conceded that some levels turned out to be too difficult – due to his inexperience as a developer and the fact he became so skilled while play testing – but maintained that level 8 of the original was <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> of his creations. Campbell named most of the game's levels after songs titles and lyrics (prominently The Jesus and Mary Chain), but also referenced wider pop culture artifacts such as gameshows and Bugs Bunny cartoons, as well as some original titles. He also referenced classic games in the level design itself.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing the CD-ROM based Saturn port, EGM {{commented that}} the {{graphics}} are identical to the arcade version but that there are missing sound effects and [...] "unbearable" [...] slowdown when first performing a special move. They rated it the best home version of the game to date but felt that with Mortal Kombat II having considerably aged by this point, any port needed to be near arcade perfect to stand out. Next Generation felt that the Saturn version was arcade perfect, but that the Mortal Kombat series {{as a whole was}} grossly overrated and lacked any gameplay innovations to make it stand out from other fighting games. They summarized that [...] "if you are a fan of the game (and you know who you are), then the Saturn version is everything you can hope for - an arcade-perfect translation - and yet, there is nothing outside of a flashy presentation and a little gore to recommend this game over a million others just like it." [...] Scary Larry of GamePro agreed that the Saturn port [...] "duplicates the arcade version perfectly", but argued that the slowdown and load times make the game frustrating to play. He concluded that the conversion would make a decent holdover until Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 hit the Saturn, but fails to measure up to Mortal Kombat 3 on the PlayStation. Sega Saturn Magazine was extremely disappointed with {{the final version of the}} Saturn port, calling it [...] "much <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> of the versions seen on the cartridge format," [...] as opposed to the vastly superior pre-release version they had reviewed five months earlier.|$|E

2500|$|According to the United Nations Development Program, however, recent {{growth in}} the {{national}} economy has benefited only the [...] "very few", leaving out {{the majority of the}} population.

If the US has pushed too hard, too quickly, and sometimes for the wrong thing, the Islamic leader that tries to defeat Islamic extremism by blocking or delaying reform, or making concessions to Islamic extremism, is guilty of committing self-inflicted wounds to his own faith and country—a failure far <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> failure by Western states." ...|$|E
2500|$|Income {{inequality}} {{among the}} EU-15 was {{highest in the}} UK, and wages had fallen by 10% in real terms since 2008, <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> OECD country apart from Greece. Real wages grew in Germany by 14%, in France by 11%, and across the OECD by 6.7%. The Office for Budget Responsibility forecast in 2014 that individuals would have to borrow £360bn (excluding mortgages) {{over the next five}} years if the economy was to grow at the rate expected by the Government. Unsecured household debt rose by 24% between 2011 and 2015, adding to widespread questions over the sustainability of the economic recovery. The Bank of England insisted there was no cause for alarm, despite having said two years earlier that the recovery was [...] "neither balanced nor sustainable".|$|E
2500|$|In September 2017, Fox {{was once}} again in the news after President Trump {{announced}} he would end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in six months if the U.S. congress failed to pass legislation to address the issue. [...] In response, Fox tweeted to President Trump's Twitter account, [...] "Ending DACA is {{on the top of the}} vilest acts you’ve pulled off. You’re destroying the legacy of greater men before you." [...] In another tweet, Fox suggested that President Trump's DACA decision was a result of him compensating for earlier failures to pass healthcare legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act. [...] Fox then went on to post a video in which he claimed that President Trump had [...] "failed America" [...] and stated that [...] "his measure is cruel and heartless, <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> machine.

2500|$|Béguin, who was {{labelled}} [...] "a {{disgrace to}} Switzerland”, was appointed {{at his own}} request as the commander of the camp, presumably because no career officer desired that job. The sanitary facilities were disastrous, and Béguin stole the food packages and harassed the Allied internees. [...] "He was a Nazi, not only a Nazi sympathizer," [...] Robert Cardenas told CBS 8 News on the occasion of an 2013 interview. Cardenas is a retired U.S. Air Force Brigadier General, and was a captain in the 44th Bomb Group interned in Switzerland in 1944. While Cardenas was not himself sent to Wauwilermoos, he did visit it and witnessed the camp's abysmal conditions firsthand. In his recollection [...] "the beds were wooden planks or some of them were only straw on the floor”, [...] "American prisoners were subjected to physical and sexual abuse, starvation, freezing, disease-ridden conditions and virtually no hygiene facilities", and the camp [...] "was exactly like, if not <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> POW camp in Germany, it was horrible”.|$|E
2500|$|Acceleration {{presents}} {{gifted children}} academic material from established curricula that is commensurate with their ability and preparedness, {{and for this}} reason is a low-cost option {{from the perspective of the}} school. This may result in a small number of children taking classes targeted at older children. [...] However, for the majority of gifted students, acceleration is beneficial both academically and socially. [...] "Radical acceleration (acceleration by two or more years) is effective academically and socially for highly gifted students." [...] Some advocates have argued that the disadvantages of being retained in a standard mixed-ability classroom are substantially <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> shortcomings of acceleration. For example, psychologist Miraca Gross reports: [...] "the majority of these children [...] are socially rejected , isolated, and deeply unhappy. Children of IQ 180+ who are retained in the regular classroom are even more seriously at risk and experience severe emotional distress." [...] These accelerated children should be placed together in one class if possible. Research suggests that acceleration might have an impact long after students graduate from high school. For example, one study shows that high-IQ individuals who experienced full-grade acceleration earned higher incomes as adults.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{of those}} who have been labeled [...] "anti-Mormon" [...] object to the designation, arguing that the term implies that {{disagreement}} or criticism of Mormonism stems from some inherent [...] "anti-Mormon" [...] prejudice, rather than being part of a legitimate factual or religious debate. Eric Johnson, for example, makes a distinction between [...] "personal animosity and intellectual dialogue". Johnson insists that he is motivated by [...] "love and compassion for Mormons", and that while he [...] " [...] plead guilty to being against Mormonism", he finds the suggestion that he is anti-Mormon [...] "both offensive and inaccurate." [...] Stephen Cannon elaborates,It is also helpful to know that Mormons are a group of people united around a belief system. Therefore, to be [...] "anti-Mormon" [...] is to be against people. Christians who desire to communicate the Gospel of Jesus Christ to Mormons are never to come against people of any stripe. Yes, evangelical Christians do have strong disagreements with Mormonism, but the argument is with a belief system and not a people. The LDS people are no better or no <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> other group of people. Any dispute is to be a disagreement with the [...] "ism", not the [...] "Mormon".|$|E
5000|$|Morale {{plummeted}} among {{soldiers and}} marines.

2500|$|The J. Edgar Hoover Building {{was widely}} praised when first erected. Washington Post {{architectural}} critic Wolf Von Eckardt called it [...] "gutsy" [...] and [...] "bold" [...] architecture in 1964. It was, he asserted, [...] "...masculine, no-nonsense architecture {{appropriate for a}} national police headquarters. It is a promising beginning for the new Pennsylvania Avenue." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Paul Gapp was more equivocal. Writing in 1978, he felt the uneven cornice line gave [...] "the taller facades of the building a rather intimidating, temple-like look vaguely reminiscent of an old Cecil B. Dé Mille set". He also criticized the open second deck for having a dark, cavernous look and the interior for being [...] "Federal drab". But on balance, Gapp wrote, while the FBI building [...] "falls considerably below C.F. Murphy's general level of design excellence ...it is not the visual disaster some of its detractors have made it out to be." [...] He declared it mediocre architecture, but not <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> other federal building built in Washington, D.C., the past decade. New York Times architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable was also less enthusiastic. Although she enumerated several of the building's flaws, she nonetheless felt the design did a [...] "superior job" [...] in reconciling numerous problems facing the site and the uses to which the structure would be put.|$|E
2500|$|Before leaving, Kelly {{told the}} group that when Fitzpatrick, the Benalla constable, was shot, he was not within 400 miles of Greta. However, he {{admitted}} to stealing 280 horses from Whitty's station and denied that he had committed any other crime. The horses, he stated, were sold to Baumgarten. Kelly showed the group his revolvers, and pointed out one which he had taken from Constable Lonigan, and further stated that he had shot Lonigan with a worn-out, crooked musket, held together with string and 'could shoot around corners'. He asked those present how they would like detectives pointing revolvers at their mothers and sisters, threatening to shoot them {{if they did not}} say where they were. He blamed such treatment for turning him against the law. He said that he had come only to shoot the two policemen, Devine and Richards, calling them <b>worse</b> <b>than</b> <b>any</b> black trackers, especially Richards, whom he intended to shoot immediately. Tarleton remarked that Kelly should not blame Richards for doing his duty. Kelly then replied, [...] "Suppose you had your revolver ready when I came in, would you not have shot me ?" [...] Mr Tarleton replied [...] "Yes." [...] "Well", said Kelly, [...] "that's just what I am going to do with Richards—shoot him before he shoots me." [...] The party then interceded for Richards, but Kelly said, [...] "He must die." [...] Before leaving Ned Kelly remarked that he had made a great blunder which would likely lead to their capture.|$|E
