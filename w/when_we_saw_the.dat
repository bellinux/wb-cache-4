2500|$|The photo shows Springsteen {{holding a}} Fender Telecaster with an Esquire neck, while leaning against saxophonist Clarence Clemons. [...] That image became famous as the cover art. [...] "Other things happened," [...] says Meola, [...] "but <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> contact sheets, that one {{just sort of}} popped. Instantly, we knew that was the shot." [...] Ultra-thin {{lettering}} graced the mass-produced version: an unusual touch then; a design classic since.|$|E
2500|$|Japanese Actions Inspire the Peoples of Asia:"Japanese {{soldiers}} {{drove out}} {{the forces of}} Western Europe, which had colonized the nations of Asia for many years. They surprised us, because we didn’t think we could possibly beat the white man, and they inspired us with confidence. They awakened us from our long slumber, and convinced us to make the nation of our ancestors our own nation once again. We cheered the Japanese soldiers as they marched through the Malay Peninsula. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> defeated British troops fleeing, we felt an excitement we had never experienced before.

2500|$|On top of {{his grief}} for his family and friends, Zubeidi was greatly embittered {{by the fact that}} none of the Israelis who had {{accepted}} his mother's hospitality, and whom he had thought were his friends, tried to contact him. In a 2006 interview he stated angrily, [...] "You took our house and our mother and you killed our brother. We gave you everything and what did we get in return? A bullet in my mother’s chest. We opened our home and you demolished it. Every week, 20-30 Israelis would come to do theatre there. We fed them. And afterward, not one of them picked up the phone. That is <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> real face of the left in Israel." [...] The Al-Aqsa Martyrs’ Brigades may reach peace with Israel, he says, but he won’t personally. He won’t forgive the killing of his mother and brother and the razing of his house.|$|E

60|$|Making our {{way with}} all speed to the {{outermost}} {{portion of the}} point on which we were standing at the moment, we waved our arms vigorously, not daring to shout, and the craft was yet {{a quarter of a}} mile away <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> by <b>the</b> commotion aboard that our signals had been seen and understood.|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] Harry said, laughing, [...] "we little thought, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> {{champagne}} {{handed over}} to the rajah, {{that we were going to}} have the serving of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Me and Henry laid low {{until the}} day the steamer came back. <b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> captain's boat on the beach we went down {{and stood in the}} edge of the water. The captain grinned when he saw us.|$|E

5000|$|Making {{that first}} episode was not easy. There {{were lots of}} {{technical}} problems and it took ages to shoot the various scenes showing how the pilots reached their craft. We got very weary with it but in <b>the</b> end, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> all <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> finished film, the way Gerry Andersonhad planned and edited it with the editors, we all agreed it was well worth it. - Director Alan Pattillo's response (2000) ...|$|R
60|$|The Prince, who is {{travelling}} incognito as the Count of Flim Flam, was wearing, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> him, <b>the</b> plain morning {{dress of}} a gentleman of leisure. We {{learned that a}} little earlier he had appeared at breakfast in the costume of a Unitarian clergyman, under the incognito of the Bishop of Bongee; while later on he appeared at lunch, as a delicate compliment to our city, in the costume of a Columbia professor of Yiddish.|$|R

6000|$|... 'We were troubled {{for fear}} that the Wise Iron should fail us now that its Yellow Man had gone, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> Spirit still served us we grew afraid of too strong winds, and of shoals, and of {{careless}} leaping fish, {{and of all the}} people on all the shores where we landed.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Davis, [...] "I {{suppose you}} may call it an accident. We had heard of your island, and read that thing in the Directory about the private reasons, you see; so <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> lagoon {{reflected}} in the sky, we put her head for it at once, and so here we are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{all very}} well, Dick; but I think that you and I were just as much frightened as <b>the</b> Spaniards were, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> how <b>the</b> thing had succeeded, and that all our troops were called out. There is no saying {{what they would have}} done to us, had they found out who started the report. The very least thing that would have {{happened}} would have been to be tried by court martial, and dismissed from the service; and I am by no means sure that worse than that would not have befallen us." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> this in <b>the</b> army, 'twas {{time to look}} about.

6000|$|... "Ah, that {{accounts}} for it," [...] the gentleman said. [...] "I {{do not think that}} he is seriously hurt. I am a doctor; and was luckily out riding with these gentlemen, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> happened to look up and saw your balloon falling, like a stone, from the clouds. We thought at first that you must be dashed to pieces; but <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>the</b> speed was being a little checked, we had some hope, and galloped in the direction in which it was falling. We were within five hundred yards when you fell, but we hardly expected to see anyone alive.|$|R
60|$|On the {{following}} noon we topped another rise, and came unmistakably {{in sight of}} the Stikeen River lying deep in its rocky cañon. We had ridden all the morning in a pelting rain, slashed by wet trees, plunging through bogs and sliding down ravines, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> valley just before us we raised a cheer. It seemed {{we could hear the}} hotel bells ringing far below.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's so," [...] said Mrs. Aleshine; [...] "and me and Mrs. Lecks would 'a' {{got right}} in <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> boat was empty, if we hadn't {{been afraid to}} be there without any man, for it might have floated off, and neither of us don't know nothin' about rowin'. And then Mrs. Lecks she thought of you, supposin' {{a young man who}} knew so much about the sea would know how to row." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{made our}} number <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> lugger with an English ensign set, for {{we did not}} suppose a Frenchman would be quietly lying in a Tuscan port; but the answer we got was nonsense; and then we remembered to have heard that this Raoul Yvard was {{in the habit of}} playing such tricks all along the Italian coast. Once on the scent, we were not the men to be easily thrown off it. You saw the chase and know the result." ...|$|E
500|$|On 31 December 2008, it was {{announced}} that Pratchett was to be knighted (as a Knight Bachelor) in the Queen's 2009 New Year Honours. He formally received the accolade at Buckingham Palace on 18 February 2009. Afterwards he said, [...] "You can't ask a fantasy writer not to want a knighthood. You know, for two pins I'd get myself a horse and a sword." [...] In late 2009, he did make himself a sword, {{with the help of his}} friends. He told a Times Higher Education interviewer that [...] "At the end of last year I made my own sword. I dug out the iron ore from a field about 10miles away – I was helped by interested friends. We lugged 80kilos of iron ore, used clay from the garden and straw to make a kiln, and lit the kiln with wildfire by making it with a bow.' Colin Smythe, his long-term friend and agent, donated some pieces of meteoric iron – 'thunderbolt iron' has a special place in magic and we put that in the smelt, and I remember <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>sawed</b> <b>the</b> iron apart it looked like silver. Everything about it I touched, handled and so forth ... And everything was as it should have been, it seemed to me." ...|$|R
60|$|She did listen, and watch, when evening closed; {{but it was}} in stillest sort: {{walking the}} drawing-room with quite {{noiseless}} step. She checked at intervals her velvet march; inclined her ear, and consulted the night sounds: I should rather say, the night silence; for now, at last, the wind was fallen. The sky, relieved of its avalanche, lay naked and pale: through the barren boughs of the avenue we could see it well, and note also the polar splendour of the new-year moon--an orb white as a world of ice. Nor was it late <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> also <b>the</b> return of the carriage.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile, our advance had begun, nor in {{the midst}} of the general jubilation was any {{particular}} notice taken of us till we were in the middle of the square of Mur and within half a mile of <b>the</b> palace, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> by <b>the</b> moonlight that a large body of troops, two or three thousand of them, were drawn up in front of us, apparently to bar our way. Still we went on till a number of officers rode up, and addressing the commander of the regiment of Mountaineers, demanded to know why he had left his post, and whither he went.|$|R
60|$|We {{wasted no}} time in talk as we knew that the warriors would surely return as soon as they had gained control of their mounts. Hastening to his damaged machine we were bending every effort to finish the needed repairs and had almost {{completed}} them <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> two green monsters returning at top speed from opposite sides of us. When they had approached within a hundred yards their thoats again became unmanageable and absolutely refused to advance further toward the air craft which had frightened them.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's bravely done, young master," [...] {{one of them}} said; [...] "and {{you have}} saved missy's life surely. The savage brute rushed into the yard and bit a young colt and a heifer, and then, as we came running out with forks, he took to the road again. We chased 'um along, not knowing who we might meet, and it gived us a rare turn <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> master's Bessy {{standing}} alone in the road, wi' nout {{between her and the}} dog. Where have you been, Miss Bessy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{our good}} fortune to leave the Streak when we did, for a little later one of the spy {{fishermen}} appeared. Charley and I took up our accustomed places, on the stringer-piece, {{a little ahead of}} the Streak and over our own boat, where we could comfortably watch the Lancashire Queen. Nothing occurred till about nine o'clock, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> two Italians leave the ship and pull along their side of the triangle toward the shore. Charley looked as unconcerned as could be, but before they had covered a quarter of the distance, he whispered to me: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Captain saw it too, for he gave {{a strange}} sort of cry. 'My God!' he said, 'they will {{overtake}} her.' We war still a mile from them, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> suddenly <b>the</b> man in front--this chap Dick here--part sudden from the white horse, wheel straight round, and go right back at the Injins. They separated as he came to them. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> two fall from their horses, and the wind presently brought {{the sound of the}} cracks of pistols. There war no 'Colts' in those days, but I knew that Dick carried a brace of double-barrelled pistols in his holsters. Then the others closed round him.|$|R
60|$|The swoon {{sometimes}} actually {{takes place}} before the animal has been touched, and even when the exciting cause is at a considerable distance. I was once riding with a gaucho, <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw,</b> on <b>the</b> open level ground before us, a fox, not yet fully grown, standing still and watching our approach. All at once it dropped, and <b>when</b> <b>we</b> {{came up to the}} spot it was lying stretched out, with eyes closed, and apparently dead. Before passing on my companion, who said it {{was not the first time}} he had seen such a thing, lashed it vigorously with his whip for some moments, but without producing the slightest effect.|$|R
5000|$|We do {{not need}} this {{blueprint}} to produce excellent students. What {{we need is a}} revival of the old education system... meaning the education system we had before 1957. That was <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> dedication from <b>the</b> teachers. The Malaysian education system then was second to none in Asia. We did not have sports schools but we produced citizens who were Asian class, if not world class.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah--heaven help us {{and forgive}} us!" [...] said I; but Miss C. can never forgive the mother or child; and she {{clapped her hands}} for joy one day <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> {{shutters}} up, bills in the windows, a carpet hanging out over the balcony, and a crowd of shabby Jews about the steps--giving token that the reign of Mrs. Stafford Molyneux was over. The pastry-cooks and their trays, the bay and the gray, the brougham and the groom, the noblemen and their cabs, were all gone; and the tradesmen in the neighborhood were crying {{out that they were}} done.|$|E
60|$|We came {{finally to}} the noble grove of orange-trees {{in which the}} Oriental city of Jaffa lies buried; we passed through the walls, and rode again down narrow streets and among swarms of {{animated}} rags, and saw other sights and had other experiences we had long been familiar with. We dismounted, for the last time, and out in the offing, riding at anchor, we saw the ship! I put an exclamation point there because we felt one <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> vessel. The long pilgrimage was ended, and somehow we seemed to feel glad of it.|$|E
6000|$|... "It must be owned," [...] {{another of}} the group said, [...] "that these wolves bite hard. I was in Paris last year, with the Count de Caussac. Well, we laughed <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> <b>the</b> three parties of white wolves ride out from Saint Denis; but I tell you, there was no {{laughing}} when they got among us. We were in the Constable's troop; and though, as far as I know, we were all pretty stout men-at-arms, and were four to one against them at least, we had little to boast of when the fight was over.|$|E
6000|$|... "So we were saved," [...] Klaus said. [...] "Chance. It {{might have}} been others. We--we finished, and then we {{came up to the}} surface and started back along the ridge. That was <b>when</b> <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> them, <b>the</b> Davids. <b>We</b> {{understood}} right away. We had seen the photos of the First Variety, the Wounded Soldier. Our Commissar distributed them to us with an explanation. If we had gone another step they would have seen us. As it was we had to blast two Davids before we got back. There were hundreds of them, all around. Like ants. We took pictures and slipped back here, bolting the lid tight." ...|$|R

2500|$|The single's cover art was a still {{from the}} film Dunkirk (1958) {{featuring}} British actor Sean Barrett, praying but looking sufficiently {{as though he was}} holding his crotch to have the sleeve banned in the United States, where a photograph of the band backstage at the 1984 Glastonbury Festival, which had previously appeared on the gatefold inside the Hatful of Hollow compilation, was used instead. It is the only time a portrait of the band has appeared on the cover of one of their releases.
