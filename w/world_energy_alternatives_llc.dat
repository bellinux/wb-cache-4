Now the fossil fuels which are mainly used in diesel engines are depleting continually accompanied by increasing consumption and prices, there {{is the need to}} find alternative fuel to fulfil the <b>worlds</b> <b>energy</b> demand. <b>Alternative</b> fuels like biodiesel, are being used as effective alternative for diesel. The feasibility of biodiesel production from palm oil was investigated with respect to its fuel properties. Though biodiesel can replace diesel satisfactorily, problems related to fuel properties persist. In this study an oxygenated additive 1 -butanol (BU) was blended with palm oil biodiesel (POME) in the ratios of 1 %, 3 %, 5 % and 7 % and tested for their properties improvement. These blends were tested for energy content and various fuel properties according to ASTM standards. Qualifying of the effect of additive on palm biodiesel fuel properties can serve the researchers who work on biodiesel fuels to indicate the fuel suitability for diesel engines according to fuel standards. Blends of BU in POME resulted in an improvement in acid value, viscosity, density and pour point with increasing content of BU in the blend. Further improvement in the pour point temperature of the palm oil methyl esters 1 -butanol blends (B-BU) at 7 °C can be achieved by adding 7 % BU additive to POME, accompanied by 8. 07 % decrease in energy content of biodiesel...|$|R

In this regard, a mathematical model of heat-mass exchange processes in flat solar collectors is introduced in this article. The model was a basis for the development of a new solar collector, named SUN 1, which has an original heating tubes form. This form allows heat transfer medium to be under the influence of solar energy for a longer time and consequently to warm to a higher temperature, increasing the warming rapidity...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the role of}} <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> technologies in displacing fossil fuels as the <b>world's</b> primary <b>energy</b> source. To that end, a CAPM-GARCH multi-factor market model is used to investigate the relationship between returns on oil and <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> stocks. Results show that an increase in oil prices and the broad market have a statistically significant and positive impact on <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> stock returns. Furthermore, the <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> sector is substantially more risky than the broad market but {{has the potential for}} higher returns. This highlights the infancy and inherently risky nature of the <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> sector today, but demonstrates the potential for substantial future investment gain as <b>alternative</b> <b>energy</b> technologies become more mature and widely available.

40|$|Although both {{promoted}} as sustainable, nuclear {{and renewable energy}} elicit different evaluations in people. People expect (whether true or not) different implications for the environment and for consumers' resources from these <b>energy</b> <b>alternatives.</b> But what factors define the perceived importance of these environmental and individual consequences, and will this affect people's attitudes toward <b>energy</b> <b>alternatives?</b> Do these factors also influence perceptions of consequences of <b>energy</b> <b>alternatives?</b> The authors propose that people's biospheric (e. g. valuing nature) and egoistic (e. g. valuing wealth) values affect evaluations of <b>energy</b> <b>alternatives</b> in three important ways. First, as expected, {{the results showed that}} the stronger their egoistic values, the more important people find individual consequences of <b>energy</b> <b>alternatives,</b> whereas the stronger their biospheric values, the more important they find environmental consequences. Second, this indeed translated into attitudes: the stronger their egoistic values, the more people favored nuclear energy and the less they favored renewable energy, whereas the opposite was found for biospheric values. Third, values colored the perceptions of consequences. Specifically, whether people ascribed negative or positive consequences to <b>energy</b> <b>alternatives</b> aligned with their value-based attitudes toward these alternatives. The results were robust despite variations in <b>energy</b> <b>alternatives</b> and the methods used. Practical implications are provided. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Sustainable energy {{transitions}} will be hampered without sufficient public support. Hence, it {{is important}} to understand what drives public acceptability of (sustainable) <b>energy</b> <b>alternatives.</b> Evaluations of specific costs, including risks, and benefits of different <b>energy</b> <b>alternatives</b> have been linked to acceptability of these alternatives. But how do people come up with these evaluations, and which evaluations are the key drivers of acceptability? In this review, we propose a comprehensive conceptual framework in which we integrate two growing but so far unconnected bodies of research on how objective characteristics of <b>energy</b> <b>alternatives</b> (i. e., contextual factors), on one hand, and, on the other hand, general psychological factors shape evaluations and acceptability of <b>energy</b> <b>alternatives.</b> Importantly, we identify general factors, particularly values, that may influence evaluations and acceptability of many different <b>energy</b> <b>alternatives</b> on a general as well as community level. We put forward a research agenda with two major themes. First, we lay out possibilities to strengthen the current knowledge basis for a conceptual framework that explains evaluations and acceptability of <b>energy</b> <b>alternatives.</b> Second, we suggest how the framework could be extended to explain evaluations and acceptability of <b>energy</b> <b>alternatives</b> in a more comprehensive and accurate way. Based on the knowledge developed, we discuss policy implications, some of which have not been put forward yet and hence propose new possibilities for interventions aimed at enhancing sustainable energy transitions.
