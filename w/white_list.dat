The two lists are also adopted by Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania, even though the four countries are not yet part of the Schengen Area.|$|E

This has a higher deliverability than normal direct email lists and is usually used for the delivery of newsletters or other regular information distributed to clients or subscribers.|$|R

25|$|The Schengen area mostly {{functions}} as a single country for international travel purposes, with a common visa policy. Since 2001, the European Union has issued two lists regarding visas for the Schengen Area: a <b>white</b> <b>list</b> of countries whose nationals do not require visas (Annex II) and a black list of countries whose nationals do require visas (Annex I). As per Regulation No 539/2001 (amended by Regulation No 1289/2013) reciprocity is required from all Annex II countries and territories. That means that these countries must offer visa-free access for 90 days to citizens of Norway and the other Schengen member states.|$|E

25|$|During the 1939–1945 Emergency {{extensive}} {{postal censorship}} took {{place under the}} control of the Department of Defence whose powers were conferred by the Emergency Powers Act 1939. Civilian mail was controlled by the approximately 200 censors who worked in Dublin's Exchequer Street and who had all been vetted by the G2 Directorate of Intelligence and the Gardaí. Using the Black List and <b>White</b> <b>List</b> to target certain mail, the small staff were unable to effect 100% censorship; however, continental European mail was all reviewed, as was all incoming and outbound airmail. Following the overthrow of France and the Low Countries in May 1940, the British instigated full terminal mail censorship but the Irish were unable to look at more than about 10% due to the enormous staff this would have required. Covert censorship of mail between Northern Ireland and the south was effected by warrants obtained by G2, who also obtained warrants from the Minister for Justice for internal mail oversight.|$|E
60|$|Another bushwhacking contrivance; simply that, nothing else! I find a {{good many}} people who are very much {{concerned}} about the loss of Southern trade. Now either these people are sincere or they are not. I will speculate a little about that. If they are sincere, and are moved by any real danger of the loss of Southern trade, they will simply get their names on the <b>white</b> <b>list,</b> and then, instead of persuading Republicans to do likewise, they will be glad to keep you away! Don't you see that they cut off competition? They would not be whispering around to Republicans to come in and share the profits with them. But if they are not sincere, and are merely trying to fool Republicans out of their votes, they will grow very anxious about your pecuniary prospects; they are afraid {{you are going to get}} broken up and ruined; they do not care about Democratic votes, oh, no, no, no!

40|$|Using a {{case study}} of a recent UK {{whitelist}} intended to regulate online gambling, I examine the affective politics of listing. I pay particular attention to the racial dynamics of black and <b>white</b> <b>listing.</b> By charting how the gambling whitelist worked and failed to work as a tool in the designation of jurisdictional reputation, I argue that the use and subsequent abandonment of the whitelist shows the centrality of racial dynamics to listing practices, particularly in relation to how the list was deployed in debates about the trustworthiness of the Kahnawá:ke territory and Antigua and Barbuda. In section 5 I examine what happened after the demise of the online gambling whitelist. Although non-listing techniques of governance look to be expanding, in the form of increased surveillance of individual gamblers, lists continue to {{play a key role in}} the UK government’s new model of gambling regulation. I suggest that this confirms the co-constitutive and mutually reinforcing nature of black and <b>white</b> <b>lists</b> as techniques of governance, and the value of exploring them and their racialized implications together...|$|R
