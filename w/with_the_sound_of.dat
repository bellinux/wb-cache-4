The record contains fifteen tracks, most of which were composed by Santos and co-produced with Ivan Chevere. The album experiments <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> bachata and other genres including R and flamenco.

Multiple shots of the singer follow, of which depict her sitting on a floor and leaving a bathroom after vomiting. The clip then sees contestants looking tired and distressed backstage.|$|E
5|$|While riders queue {{they are}} shown three {{briefing}} videos featuring actor Renny Krupinski as a sinister man surrounded in darkness, who explains at length {{the physical and}} psychological effects of riding on Oblivion. Although based on scientific facts, his speeches are deliberately exaggerated with hyperbole and dark humour to give riders a sense of intimidation while preparing for Oblivion. The man remains unnamed throughout the videos, although the character was originally {{referred to as the}} Lord of Darkness during production. The final preshow video features a second character whose image appears inverted and therefore glowing white, who argues with the Lord of Darkness as to whether Oblivion is really safe for riders to experience; to which he is repeatedly ignored. The Lord of Darkness maintains that the ride is safe, before the video ends <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> his ominous laughter.|$|E

As the songs audio begins to play, band members of Maroon 5 start to play their instruments as Rihanna sits and watches them. The table and band scenes are intercut {{with each other for}} the first verse and chorus. For the second verse, Levine and Rihanna appear to argue and try to ignore the other's advances. Rihanna lays suggestively on a bed while Levine sits on a chair with his head turned in the opposite direction for the bridge. For the final chorus, the pair appear to reconcile, ending with Levine finally giving in to his temptations and walk {{to the end of the}} table where Rihanna sits and he caresses her neck causing Rihanna to lean towards him seductively and the two nearly kiss as the video ends. The video was made available to download digitally via iTunes on May 12, 2008.|$|E

5000|$|The Allmusic review stated [...] "Autophysiopsychic is {{probably}} the single album that many Yusef Lateef fans either love or hate the most... five fat slices of original funk that have far more in common <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> Chocolate City than <b>with</b> <b>the</b> bop <b>sounds</b> <b>of</b> 52nd Street. Autophysiopsychic is awash in <b>the</b> soft soul-funk-jazz <b>sound</b> typical <b>of</b> Creed Taylor's (CTI) productions in the 1970s... Not the most typical album in Lateef's wide-ranging catalog, but certainly the most fun".|$|R

25|$|Shortly after 9 A.M., {{with the}} {{submersible}} {{about to be}} lifted {{out of the water}} with a towline back onto the ship, a water alarm sounded in the aft sphere, a self-contained part of the submersible containing machinery and oil storage. The towline had apparently fouled on the aft sphere hatch and wrenched it open. <b>With</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> water entering the aft compartment, Pisces III became inverted and began to sink back to the seabed. The aft sphere was now fully flooded. The additional weight of water now added over a tonne of extra weight to the submersible.|$|E
25|$|The four terrorists stormed {{into the}} ship's dining room. They shot their {{automatic}} weapons {{over the heads}} of the eating passengers. Screams from the passengers meshed with the shouting of the gunmen and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> falling glass shards and splinters. Viola Meskin tried to run to a door but was intercepted by a terrorist with a gun who turned her back. Austrian passenger Anna Hoeranter ran to an exit but was pushed down an adjacent flight of stairs by one of the terrorists. Other passengers ran in a panic from the dining room into the kitchen and were chased by one of the terrorists. Inside the kitchen the pursuing terrorist beat two of the kitchen staff to the floor.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Roy Torkington joined Alchemist {{in place}} of Meredith. By this time the demos had created enough {{interest}} {{for them to be}} approached by Austrian label Lethal, who released their first album, Jar of Kingdom, the next year. The album was recorded in Sydney and featured an eclectic mixture of death metal, grindcore and psychedelia. Two songs featured vocals from Michelle Klemke, a friend of Agius' mother. According to the notes accompanying the 2005 compilation album Embryonics, Agius lost his voice during the recording. Dissatisfied <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> the album, the band re-mastered and re-released it in 1999. Alchemist was also dissatisfied with Lethal's handling of Jar of Kingdom and soon parted ways with them. After releasing Jar of Kingdom, the band went on their first tour.|$|E

25|$|Murphy, then {{faced with}} the {{charging}} gang members, raised the rifle toward them and took aim. Gang member W. H. Jackson pointed his revolver at Tanner, who testified that Jackson was “possibly twenty or thirty feet” away. Tanner was unarmed and could do nothing. Jackson probably noticed Murphy was aiming his now-dead boss' rifle in his direction. This, coupled with the fast-approaching men from the Citizen's Committee, who prematurely ended their meeting <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> gun fire, perhaps convinced Jackson not fire his pistol at Tanner. Someone yelled out towards {{the men who were}} with Smith, “They have killed Soapy, and if you don’t clear out quick they will kill you too.” Not wanting to engage in a gun battle in which they were vastly outnumbered, the gang fled.|$|E
25|$|The {{sound of}} the carnyx was {{described}} as lugubrious and harsh, perhaps due to the loosened tongue of the bell, which shows that the instrument {{must have been a}} discrete enhancement of the Etruscan lituus, the sound of which was mostly described as bright and piercing. The carnyx was held vertically so that the sound would travel from more than three meters above the ground. Reconstructions have shown that the instrument's embouchure must have been cut diagonally as an oval opening, so the carnyx could be played in a similar fashion as a modern-day trumpet, i.e. with vibrating lips, however blown from the side. Due to the absence of valves and crooks, melodies were created by producing harmonics with overblowing techniques, as the reconstructional work by John Kenny has convincingly shown (see External links for a recording sample). The fairly wide bell guaranteed a very high playing volume, and the instrument itself must have had a considerable dynamic range. The best surviving bell of a carnyx was found in North East Scotland as part of the so-called Deskford Carnyx and featured a movable tongue. In addition the bronze jaw of the animal head may have been loosened as well in order to produce a jarring sound that would surely have been most dreadful when combined <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a few dozen more carnyces in battle. The demoralizing effect of the Gallic battle music must have been enormous: When the Celts advanced on Delphi under Brennus in 279 BC, the unusual echoing effects of the blaring horns completely overawed the Greeks, before even a single fight could commence.|$|E
25|$|On {{board the}} Jolly Roger, a young Killian is consoled by his father, Brennan, who promised his son {{that he would}} become the person that he was meant to be, only to {{suddenly}} abandon him and his brother, as he sold his sons into servitude, because Brennan was a wanted man and the ship was stolen. Years later in The Enchanted Forest, Regina recruits Hook to kill Cora, and takes Hook to a tavern, where she requires Hook to kill his father, {{who is now the}} tavern's owner. After the tavern closes, Hook confronts Brennan, who explains that his attempt to flee the law failed and was put under a sleeping curse as punishment; Brennan fell in love <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> his nurse's voice and she with him, allowing a kiss to wake him. They married, but she died soon after having their son, who was named after Liam, to honor his memory. Believed that Brennan has changed, Hook has {{to make it look like}} he had his father killed, so he can help his father and Liam escape. When Hook follows Brennan back to his home, he watches him with Liam, and witnesses his father tells Liam the same things he told Hook when he was little, which makes Hook very enraged, thinking that his father lied about having changed. When Brennan goes outside to meet Hook, he takes back his offer, and despite Brennan's insistence that he had changed, Hook kills Brennan, making Hook the person he is now. As Brennan dies, however, he tells Hook that it's never too late to change, to become a better man.|$|E
