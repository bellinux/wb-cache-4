2500|$|In May 2011 the Open Fuel Standard Act (OFS) was {{introduced}} to Congress with bipartisan support. The bill required that 50 percent of automobiles made in 2014, 80 percent in 2016, and 95 percent in 2017, be manufactured and <b>warrantied</b> to operate on non-petroleum-based fuels, which included existing technologies such as flex-fuel, natural gas, hydrogen, biodiesel, plug-in electric and fuel cell. Considering the rapid adoption of flexible-fuel vehicles in Brazil {{and the fact that}} the cost of making flex-fuel vehicles was approximately $100 per car, the bill's [...] primary objective was to promote a massive adoption of flex-fuel vehicles capable of running on ethanol or methanol fuel.|$|E

[...] There is a German rapeseed oil fuel standard DIN 51605. [...] At this point straight vegetable oil is only a niche market although the market segment in Germany is rapidly growing with large haulage vehicle fleets adopting the fuel, largely for economic reasons. A growing number of decentralised oil mills provide a large part of this fuel.|$|E

50|$|Czech {{production}} of biodiesel was already above 60,000 m³ per {{year by the}} early 1990s and is now even larger. Many of the plants are very large, including one in Olomouc which produces almost 40,000 m³ per year. From the summer of 2004, Czech producers of biodiesel for blend receive a subsidy of roughly CEK 9.50/kg. All Škoda diesels built since 1996 are <b>warrantied</b> for DIN EN 590 biodiesel use.|$|E

50|$|Prosser became closely {{associated}} with the doctrine of strict liability for products injuries. His first edition of Prosser on Torts in 1941 argued that strict products liability was developing in American law, and predicted that it would be the law of the future. By the time his influential article The Assault on the Citadel (Strict Liability to the Consumer) was published in 1960, the New Jersey Supreme Court fulfilled his prediction, holding in Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors that manufacturers implicitly <b>warrantied</b> their products against personal injury to all users. As Reporter for the Second Restatement of Torts, he helped codify strict products liability in the Restatement's Section 402A.|$|E
50|$|There {{appear to}} be design flaws with the OLED display or {{possibly}} with the firmware on the Pulse, Echo and Sky (WiFi) models. The OLED fades after one to three years, making the pen significantly more difficult to use because {{it is no longer}} possible to see if the pen is on or not and customers need to rely on the audio feedback alone. This fading issue is a known disadvantage of OLEDs and results in a limited lifespan. Users have complained to Livescribe, and the company's official response is to point users to tips on pen maintenance and then suggest that users buy a new pen at a deep discount as a replacement. Some users who received a replacement saw it plagued by the same problem. However, the company has taken advantage of ongoing improvements in OLED technology and, as of January 1, 2015, now offers a 3-year warranty on new smartpens (including the discounted replacements).The OLED issue has alienated some Livescribe users, especially with the high price tags of the accessories and of the smartpen itself.Once the OLED display fails:Many cellphone cameras can see the IR light emitted when the pen is on so using the camera to look {{at the front of the}} pen and depressing the ink cartridge is one way of determining the operating status. Additionally, using the Volume Up/Down icons will cause a beep when the pen is on. Unfortunately, there is no way to determine if the pen is actually recording audio without the OLED indications thus rendering useless one of its primary functions. Livescribe offers free, fully <b>warrantied</b> replacements to customers who experience an issue with their OLED displays when their pen is in warranty. For US customers whose smartpens are out-of-warranty, the company offers replacement options that allow customers to purchase a fully <b>warrantied</b> replacement pen for a discounted price.|$|E
50|$|Ford came up {{with three}} options for {{correcting}} this problem; use shorter suspension springs to lower the vehicle half an inch {{in the front and}} 1 inch in the back, lower the tire pressure to give the Explorer a more car-like ride, or widen the wheel base by two inches which would involve a substantial redesign. After the Explorer rolled over in company tests prior to production Ford decided to lower the suspension and remove air from the tires to 26 psi compared to 35 psi for the same tires on the Ranger. They did not widen the wheel base. One consequence of lowering the tire pressure is increased tire temperatures which could lead to a tire failure. Firestone <b>warrantied</b> these tires at 26 psi for 11 years.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes, a {{precision}} firearm's accuracy will {{be measured in}} MOA. This simply means that under ideal conditions i.e. no wind, match-grade ammo, clean barrel, and a vise or a benchrest used to eliminate shooter error, the gun is capable of producing a group of shots whose center points (center-to-center) fit into a circle, the average diameter of circles in several groups can be subtended by that amount of arc. For example, a 1 MOA rifle should be capable, under ideal conditions, of shooting an average 1-inch groups at 100 yards. Most higher-end rifles are <b>warrantied</b> by their manufacturer to shoot under a given MOA threshold (typically 1 MOA or better) with specific ammunition and no error on the shooter's part. For example, Remington's M24 Sniper Weapon System is required to shoot 0.8 MOA or better, or be rejected.|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes and {{analyzes}} a {{model for}} maximizing the profit of a product sold under warranty. The decision variables assumed in the model are {{the price of the}} product and the length of the period throughout which the manufacturer is responsible for service. The paper focuses on the dependence of optimal profit on price and protection period for a realistic and general description of a <b>warrantied</b> product. Failures are stochastic and repairs are of constant cost. Demand depends exponentially on price and warranty duration. After an introduction and literature review, the basic model is presented and assumptions are made about the particular probability law governing product failures. The optimization procedure is then illustrated for certain values of input parameters. Finally, an extensive economic analysis of the sensitivity of the optimal solution to variations in input parameters is provided. ...|$|E
40|$|Ensuring the {{correctness}} {{of a given}} {{software component}} has become a crucial aspect in Software Engineering and the Model Checking technique provides a fully automated way to achieve this goal. In particular, the usage of Model Checking in formal languages has been reinforced in the last decades because the specifications themselves provide an abstraction of the problem under study (whether created by abstraction from the software or by hand) and the properties validated at the specification level can be <b>warrantied</b> to be preserved until implementation. In this paper {{we focus on the}} main issues for adding Model Checking functionalities to the RAISE specification language and present the most important characteristics of our current approach for doing so. An outline of the main issues and problems faced in the process and possible ways to solve them are also presented. Eje: Ingeniería de software y base de dato...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} recent works have {{addressed}} the problem of describing the allocation of resources in an economy where prices are fixed at a value that does not achieve equilibrium {{of supply and demand}} in the classical sense. In the context of a model developed by Drèze, {{the purpose of this paper}} is to describe more precisely the different states of the markets (excess supply or excess demand) that may occur near a competitive equilibrium. A general analytical picture is obtained, which associates with each state of the markets the region of the price domain where it prevails. This allows us to point out an important difficulty which arises in the local comparative statics of this class of model: local unicity is not <b>warrantied,</b> that is, there may exist price systems very close to some competitive price, for which all the fixed price allocations are far from the competitive allocation. Examples are shown in the macroeconomic model (two aggregate agents: households and firms, and three goods: money, output, and labor); necessary and sufficient conditions for local unicity are given in this context. They require that all commodities be Hicks-substitute for the consumer, which is another way of saying that both the marginal propensities for consumption and leisure are positive and smaller than one. On the other hand, assuming local unicity, one can look for the implications of the foregoing results for the long-run determination of prices. It is easy to show that, if the economy always reaches a fixed price allocation, an increase of the price of one commodity near the competitive equilibrium is always to the advantage of the sellers and to the disadvantage of the buyers. This suggests that the determination of prices should take the form of a struggle between buyers and sellers in each market...|$|E

40|$|The study {{looked at}} the {{relationship}} between GDP per capita and health expenditure per capita {{as well as that}} of GDP per capita and education expenditure per capita in South Africa between 1994 and 2012. Adolph Wagner’s “Law” proposes that a state will increase its government expenditure relatively to the national income (Henrekson, 1993). Any change in the amount of health expenditure will influence the per capita health expenditure in a country. In this study, using the Human Development Index (HDI) as the yardstick for Quality of Life (QoL), the concepts of Standard of Living (SoL) and per capita income were examined closely in relation to the role of government in its public expenditure programmes and how these programmes in turn influenced QoL. In particular, the role of government expenditure on health and education seems to signify the commitment of a government in improving the HDI or QoL. Using data on government expenditure in South, the relationships amongst these variables were examined. Since Quality of Life is related to health expenditure per capita, then QoL too should change as government health expenditure increases. The same is expected of an increase in education expenditure. From the study results, it is clear that total tax revenue has increased sharply since 2000 and at a much faster rate than its contribution to GDP but the government deficit has also burgeoned in tandem with government revenue collection as if in tango. The reality is that government expenditure has increased sharply since 1993 but has this been directed at QoL? Public service protests tell a different story. The departments of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs and the Police seem to be receiving the largest revenue votes, raising the question of whether there is real value added and whether this expenditure is <b>warrantied</b> in terms of SoL...|$|E
