5|$|I was {{thinking}} about how Portland is designed and planned and built, and how the planning and infrastructure of Portland is really important in what makes Portland great. I <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> static tripod as the infrastructure. The moving part was the vibrancy and life.... The most interesting part of the sculpture will be watching people try to move it.|$|E
25|$|During {{the same}} years, Daniel Bernoulli {{published}} his book Hydrodynamics (1738), {{in which he}} derived an equation for the pressure of a gas considering the collisions of its atoms with {{the walls of a}} container. He proves that this pressure is two thirds the average kinetic energy of the gas in a unit volume. Bernoulli's ideas, however, made little impact on the dominant caloric culture. Bernoulli made a connection with Gottfried Leibniz's vis viva principle, an early formulation of the principle of conservation of energy, and the two theories became intimately entwined throughout their history. Though Benjamin Thompson suggested that heat was a form of motion {{as a result of his}} experiments in 1798, no attempt was made to reconcile theoretical and experimental approaches, and it is unlikely that he <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vis viva principle.|$|E
500|$|In April 2014, García Márquez {{was hospitalized}} in Mexico. He had infections {{in his lungs}} and his urinary tract, and was {{suffering}} from dehydration. He was responding well to antibiotics. Mexican president Enrique Peña Nieto wrote on Twitter, [...] "I wish him a speedy recovery". Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos said his country <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> author {{and said in a}} tweet [...] "All of Colombia wishes a speedy recovery to the greatest of all time: Gabriel García Márquez".|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I've <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past. I've <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> Lily, <b>the</b> woman I {{might have}} married.... Well, {{why are you}} silent? Do you mind my <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> past?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{while you}} have <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dinner or the clothes, I may have <b>been</b> <b>thinking,</b> you know, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family. Now, may {{it not be}} so, Amy?' ...|$|R
60|$|She {{is sitting}} again, with her manuscripts open before her; but she <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> young monk, not of them.|$|R
500|$|Writer Steven Moffat came up {{with the}} concept for [...] "The Time of Angels" [...] and [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] when he <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> worst {{possible}} situations to be in with the Weeping Angels and thought of the inability to see. His first idea was blindness, though this developed into the situation that Amy ends up in. Moffat designed the two-part story to be a more action-oriented sequel to [...] "Blink", an episode he wrote for the third series that introduced the Weeping Angels. He was inspired by the relationship between the film Alien and its sequel, Aliens, which he referred to as [...] "the best conceived movie sequel ever", describing it as being more [...] "highly coloured" [...] as opposed to Alien more low-key tone. He also intended for the Angels to have a plan that could become [...] "almost like a war", in contrast to the way they were struggling to survive in [...] "Blink". The title [...] "Flesh and Stone" [...] was suggested by Moffat's son.|$|E
500|$|Since Carey {{intended}} #1's {{to serve}} as a sign of gratitude to her fans, the album contained four new songs not previously included on her albums. The first was a cover of Rainy Davis' [...] "Sweetheart" [...] (1987) performed as a duet with co-producer and rapper Jermaine Dupri. Dupri had worked with Carey in the past, contributing to her album Daydream, and co-produced several hip-hop remixes of her songs. Carey said of the inspiration for its recording, [...] "I <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old songs I used to listen to when I was in school. It's a really cute record. Young girls'll like it the way I liked it when I was growing up." [...] Another new song featured on #1's was [...] "When You Believe", which Carey said was included because she felt it was [...] "a miracle" [...] that she and Houston collaborated on a record. During the development of All That Glitters, Carey had been introduced to DreamWorks producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, who asked her if she would record the song [...] "When You Believe" [...] for the soundtrack to the animated film The Prince of Egypt. Carey and Houston were shown the film separately, and both became very enthusiastic about participating in the project. In an interview with MTV, Carey made the following statement regarding [...] "When You Believe" [...] and working with Whitney Houston: ...|$|E
2500|$|Sadly, Thompson {{said that}} one of the things that helped him cope with his brutal {{imprisonment}} <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fine family that awaited his return. He developed a very serious drinking problem and was in several military hospitals for treatment.|$|E
6000|$|... "Although, of course, {{there are}} several," [...] said Mr. Vyner, thoughtfully. [...] "I wonder whether we <b>were</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same one?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a fellow}} you are, Hartington, to <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> birds {{when there are}} tens of {{thousands}} of people made miserable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is it?' said Bella, looking coldly round. 'I {{suppose it}} is, now you mention it. I have not <b>been</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> evening.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “I <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spiriting away {{of human}} beings rather than pictures. In {{particular}} I <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case of my aunt, Crispina Umberleigh.” ...|$|E
6000|$|He <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bright blush that overspread {{her face}} when Hardyman first spoke to her; he <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{invitation}} to her to see the stud-farm, and to ride the roan mare; he <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> utterly powerless position in which he stood towards Isabel and towards the highly-born gentleman who admired her. But he kept his doubts and fears to himself. [...] "The train won't wait for me," [...] he said, {{and held out his}} hand once more.|$|E
60|$|Alice {{could only}} look puzzled: she <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pudding.|$|E
6000|$|... "No dangers," [...] I replied. [...] "Some little difficulty, perhaps. I <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> safest way <b>of</b> {{putting my}} two letters into Fanny's hands." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Possibly," [...] said Tito, also rising, [...] "your own {{intention}} {{may have}} anticipated what I {{was going to}} say. You <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Frate." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Divorce," [...] Mrs. Presty explained. [...] "You {{have heard}} of it, of course; and perhaps you take your brother's part?" ...|$|R
60|$|Jeff darted {{into the}} house, seized his hat, and stopped. He <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stranger.|$|E
60|$|She. They say {{men have}} a keener sense of humour than women. Now I <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scandal.|$|E
60|$|Madam, when duty calls, Paradine Fouldes {{consents}} even to look ridiculous. But I <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bellingham affair.|$|E
6000|$|... "He <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cucumbers," [...] said Ned, and a gale <b>of</b> merriment {{followed}} <b>the</b> words, for Stuffy's last mishap {{had been}} a funny one.|$|R
6000|$|... '"I {{understand}} quite well," [...] I replied. [...] "They <b>were</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{day that}} I stole <b>the</b> son <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bassa, and had danced before him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall never}} forgive any Yankee," [...] she {{retorted}} quickly. [...] "But {{we are not}} talking about him. I <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> South, and <b>of</b> you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... “I {{wonder if}} you and I <b>are</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same thing,” he said. “It {{happened}} just about this hour a year ago, and it was such another night.” ...|$|R

60|$|Addison was hearty {{enough when}} he cared to praise his friends. Pope <b>is</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coldness with which Addison treated his 'Pastorals' as {{compared}} to those of Philips.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me! Won't {{the truth}} do, then? I hoped {{you could have}} told them {{something}} consoling. I <b>am</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poor mother now. Your Russia is a cruel country." ...|$|R
