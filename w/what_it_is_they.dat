The two are arrested by German police, but when the police realize they have apprehended fellow investigators they promise cooperation. However, the pair learn that Schlossburg has already been cremated; later they narrowly escape death when their rental car has been rigged with a car bomb.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternate}} {{version of}} the parable describes normal men, experiencing a large statue on a dark night, or with blindfold masking their eyes experiencing a large object by feeling it. They then describe <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>they</b> experienced. In its various versions, it is a parable that has crossed between many religious traditions and is part of Buddhist, Hindu and Jain texts of 1st millennium CE or before. The story also appears in 2nd millennium Sufi and Bahá’í lore. The tale later became well known in Europe, with 19th century American poet John Godfrey Saxe creating his own version as a poem. The story has been published in many books for adults and children, and interpreted {{in a variety of}} ways.|$|E

60|$|The pigwidgeons now {{began to}} descend the vine; {{but one of}} them {{lingering}} a little, the Truant, who {{had a great deal of}} curiosity, asked him <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>they</b> had to divide.|$|R
60|$|This {{identification}} by one {{in authority}} calmed, if {{it a little}} disappointed, the crowd. <b>What</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>they</b> did not know, but, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> apparently not a murder, {{and they began to}} drift off.|$|R
500|$|SpongeBob and Patrick find a {{piece of}} a {{medallion}} to the lost city of Atlantis, but have no idea <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>They</b> take it to the Bikini Bottom Museum to see if the staff there know what it is. SpongeBob and Patrick run into Squidward, who thinks they stole the missing half of the medallion. He soon matches it to the displayed other half of the medallion and tells them it was the key to Atlantis. After hearing the story of Atlantis, the only thing SpongeBob and Patrick want to see is the [...] "World's Oldest Bubble." [...] Squidward then proceeds to reconnect the two halves of the medallion, opening the [...] "path to Atlantis", which is a bus that runs on [...] "song fuel".

2500|$|Gordon is {{the debut}} studio album by Canadian band Barenaked Ladies. It was {{released}} through Sire Records on July 28, 1992. After The Yellow Tape was certified platinum in Canada, the group won a contest hosted {{by a local}} radio station. With the winnings, Barenaked Ladies were able to hire producer Michael Phillip Wojewoda and record the album at Le Studio, north of Montreal. Though most of the album was recorded without incident, difficulty with [...] "The King of Bedside Manor" [...] caused the band to record the track naked—a tradition they would continue on other albums. Horn parts, guest vocalists, and nods to other bands including Rush allowed Barenaked Ladies to expand on the sound they had developed while touring. [...] "They had a real clarity about what they wanted [...] to be... I just captured <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>they</b> do," [...] said Wojewoda.|$|E

6000|$|He {{had been}} but scurvily treated by {{them in his}} Troubles, and so Universally abandon'd by the Crolians, that even the Solunarians {{themselves}} insulted them on that Head, and laugh'd at them for expecting any Body should venture for them again.----- But he forgetting their unkindness, ask'd them <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>they</b> desir'd of him? ...|$|R

5000|$|I {{only know}} now that there are {{precious}} few of these sets in circulation ...

50|$|On Christmas Day, Perdy {{found the}} letter and confronted Grayson. She {{told him she was}} going to the police but she and Grayson had a fight.

50|$|Many {{people were}} on the beach when the crate arrived and rushed to see <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was.</b> <b>They</b> tried to open it, but no one succeeded.

60|$|So {{they called}} him to come and be friends, {{and he was very}} happy to be forgiven. But he did not forget his task, and when he told them <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>they</b> called Downy-back, the mole, and bid him show Thistle where the earth elves lived.

60|$|MRS. BARTHWICK. I've no {{patience}} with your talk of reform--all that nonsense about social policy. We {{know perfectly well}} <b>what</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>they</b> want; they want things for themselves. Those Socialists and Labour men are an absolutely selfish set of people. They {{have no sense of}} patriotism, like the upper classes; they simply want what we've got.|$|E

60|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> {{rather a}} rash assertion; but Dickey spoke so {{confidently}} that his visitors {{thought it best}} not to argue the question, and Ben concluded that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> about time {{to proceed with the}} business for which they had come.

50|$|In Series 3, the grumpy {{old horse}} teacher Mr Nay became a regular character. He often fell asleep {{and was very}} stupid.

John and Lizzie shared their first dance together in the episode also.|$|R
