25|$|His last ever film <b>was</b> <b>Go</b> for a Take, an inward-looking {{treatment}} satirising {{the film}} industry, {{in which he}} took {{the part of a}} film director who has to contend with two men 'on the run' invading a set, pretending to be film extras.|$|E
25|$|His first {{professional}} football club <b>was</b> <b>Go</b> Ahead Eagles, where he stayed for two years. Go Ahead Eagles was famous back then {{for having the}} country's most successful youth academy. Derksen {{was one of the}} six players in the club's boarding school, together with Oeki Hoekema, André van der Leij, Ger Veerman, Herman Tieselink and Tiny Broers. However, he did not make it in Deventer and the 19-year-old left-back then signed a one-year-contract with Cambuur Leeuwarden.|$|E

A {{product of}} the club's youth system, he made his debut for the first team in a 2–1 victory against Den Bosch, on 14 September 1985. At the time, Eagles were {{competing}} in {{the bottom half of}} the first division, achieving a tenth-placed finish in the player's first season. However, the club experienced relegation in 1987, and failed to achieve promotion the following season. After 97 league appearances, Van der Gouw joined second level's Vitesse.|$|E

500|$|Toward {{the end of}} his life, Miller wrote another {{installment}} of the Abbey of Saint Leibowitz saga, Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman. A full-length novel (455 pages) significantly longer than its predecessor, it is set in AD 3254, eighty years after the events of [...] "Fiat Lux" [...] but several centuries before [...] "Fiat Voluntas Tua". Suffering from writer's block and fearful the new work would go unfinished, Miller arranged with author Terry Bisson to complete it. According to Bisson, all he did <b>was</b> <b>go</b> in and tie up the loose ends Miller had left. The novel tells the story of Brother Blacktooth St. George of the Leibowitzan abbey who, unlike Brother Francis, wants to be released from his holy vows and leave the abbey. In addition to recounting his travels as Cardinal Brownpony's personal secretary, the book describes the political situation in the 33rdcentury as Church and empire (Texark) vie for power. Miller died before the novel's publication.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Madonna {{starred in}} the film Evita, playing the titular role. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Eva and even {{wrote a letter to}} {{director}} Alan Parker, explaining how she would be perfect for the part. After securing the role, she underwent vocal training with coach Joan Lader since Evita required the actors to sing their own parts. Lader noted that the singer [...] "had to use her voice in a way she's never used it before. Evita is real musical theater— its operatic, in a sense. Madonna developed an upper register that she didn't know she had." [...] From the moment she was signed in the film, Madonna had expressed interest in recording a dance version of [...] "Don't Cry for Me Argentina". According to her publicist Liz Rosenberg, [...] "since [...] didn't write the music and lyrics, she wanted her signature on that song... I think on her mind, {{the best way to do}} it <b>was</b> <b>go</b> in the studio and work up a remix".|$|E

2500|$|McClanahan's career-long 41-yard run on Minnesota's {{first play}} of the game set up quarterback Fran Tarkenton's 18-yard {{touchdown}} pass to tight end Stu Voigt. Washington defensive back Eddie Brown gave his team some early scoring opportunities with big special teams plays, first returning the kickoff 26 yards to the 38-yard line, and later returning a punt 17 yards to the Vikings 45. [...] But the team was unable to capitalize. [...] All they could do after the kickoff return <b>was</b> <b>go</b> three-and-out, and on the first play after his big punt return, Billy Kilmer threw a pass that was intercepted by Bobby Bryant. [...] Now momentum seemed slipping away, but on the first play after Bryant's pick, Washington took the ball right back with an interception by safety Jake Scott, who returned it 17 yards to the Minnesota 34-yard line. [...] Three plays later, Mark Moseley kicked a 47-yard field goal that cut the Washington deficit to 7-3. Later in the quarter, Minnesota drove 66 yards and scored when Tarkenton threw a 27-yard pass to Sammy White. [...] Safety Ken Houston deflected the ball, but it still bounced to White, who made a diving juggling catch for a touchdown to put the Vikings up 14-3. [...] By {{the end of the first}} quarter, the Vikings had gained 143 yards, while holding Washington to 18 yards and no first downs.|$|E

60|$|Rollo {{sat down}} on the grass a minute or two, wishing that he had not touched the wheelbarrow. It was unwise for him to have left his basket, his regular and proper mode of {{carrying}} the chips, to try experiments with the wheelbarrow, which he was not at all accustomed to. And now the proper course for him to have taken, would have been to leave the wheelbarrow where it <b>was,</b> <b>go</b> and get the basket, take out the chips from the wheelbarrow, and carry them, a basket full at a time, to the bin, then take the wheelbarrow to its place, and go on with his work in the way he began.|$|E
6000|$|Ten {{minutes later}} the splendid, two-thousand guinea motor brougham drew up at {{the offices of the}} Judge and the obsequious motor-footman bowed Major Vernon through its rather grimy doorway.

So up he went, and when he reached the {{indicated}} locality was taken possession of by a worried-looking clerk who had evidently been waiting for him, and almost thrust through a door to find himself in a big, worn, untidy room. At a huge desk in this room sat an elderly man, also big, worn, and untidy-looking, who waved a long slip of galley-proof in his hand, and was engaged in scolding a sub-editor.|$|E
60|$|It was half-past {{four in the}} {{afternoon}} when the two men started. The current of the Thirty Mile River {{was so strong that}} rarely could they use the paddles.

It was exhausting work. Antonsen toiled like the giant he was, uncomplaining, persistent, but driven to his utmost by the powerful body and indomitable brain of Churchill. They never paused for rest.

Murray told me that the guy on the inside who wanted the job done had been working some kind of a pay-roll graft and he wanted the records destroyed, and he also {{wanted to get rid of}} the guy that was hep to what he had been doin'.

As night came on, they were compelled to trust to luck. They fell repeatedly on the untraveled banks and tore their clothing to shreds in the underbrush they could not see. Both men were badly scratched and bleeding. A dozen times, in their wild dashes from bank to bank, they struck snags and were capsized. The first time this happened, Churchill dived and groped in three feet of water for the gripsack. He lost half an hour in recovering it, and after that it was carried securely lashed to the canoe. As long as the canoe floated it was safe. Antonsen jeered at the grip, and toward morning began to abuse it; but Churchill vouchsafed no explanations.|$|E
