40|$|Today, {{industrial}} and service robots are used {{all over the}} world to handle sim- ple repetitive tasks as well as more complex tasks. Many warehouses use robots for their logistical tasks, while warehouse employees only need to ensure that ev- erything is performing properly and finish some tasks like collecting items and shipping them out to customers. This thesis investigates how to reorganize a high density storage of stacks. Mul- tiple algorithms such as exhaustive, random and greedy searches were implemented on top of my own problem specific designs, and tested in simulations separated from the actual system. The results from implementations made during the work with this thesis were compared to each other and to the performance of <b>today</b> <b>s</b> system. The majority of the work in this thesis have been to design and implement my own ideas on how to solve the reorganization problem. During my work, much time have been spent to rethink, adjust and redesign the algorithms in order to get even better performance. Results from simulations of the various algorithms are promising, and improvements can be seen over the different implementations during my work. In comparison <b>with</b> how <b>today</b> <b>s</b> system performs on the reorganization task, the results are also very promising. However, the comparison of <b>today</b> <b>s</b> system and the implementations in this thesis have some uncertainties, and further work is required to confirm the improvement completely.

The power mixer should also be used for polar modulation technique. In RF communication systems, data transportation between nodes is done by adjusting frequency, phase or amplitude characteristic of a sinusoidal carrier. In systems this is performed <b>with</b> a modulator. <b>Today.</b> <b>s</b> Bluetooth transmitters use quadrature modulators. The polar modulator is an alternative architecture that can reduce current consumption, which is of particular importance in wireless communication systems like Bluetooth. The designed RF CMOS power mixer is part of the polar modulator and converts an incoming low frequency signal to a high radio frequency signal. The power mixer designed is implemented as a Gilbert mixer, which is a mixer architecture preferred in RF circuit design. The power mixer is designed with variable gain control and high output power and designed to fulfil specified targets.

We build a two-period bi- nomial moral hazard model to explain the trade-o¤s between ow, per- formance and fees where e¤ort depends on the combination of implicit (ow of funds) and explicit (performance fee) incentives. Two cases are considered. With full commitment, the investor s relevant trade-o¤ is to give up expected return {{in the second period}} vis-à-vis to induce e¤ort in the rst period. The more concerned the investor is <b>with</b> <b>today</b> <b>s</b> pay- o¤, the more willing he will be to give up expected return in the second period by penalizing negative excess return in the rst period. Without full commitment, the investor learns some symmetric and imperfect infor- mation about the ability of the manager to obtain positive excess return. In this case, observed returns reveal ability as well as e¤ort choices. We show that powerful implicit incentives may explain the ow-performance relationship with a numerical solution. Besides, risk aversion explains the complementarity between performance fee and ow of funds...|$|E

40|$|This {{book is a}} {{collection}} of papers presented at a workshop in 1999 on the evolution and effects of economic regulation in several industries. Countries around the world have been undergoing seemingly constant regulatory changes for the past decade. In the 1990 s industrialized countries began a process of deregulation, which many believe has gone too far, leading to renewed pressure for increased regulation. Developing countries, meanwhile, are liberalizing sectors once dominated by the state and struggling to develop effective regulations and regulatory agencies amidst competing interests. This collection of papers provides important and refreshing context to <b>today</b> <b>s</b> issues, reminding us that the debate over effective regulation is not new and that <b>today</b> <b>s</b> regulations have historical roots. The path-dependent nature of regulatory changes mean that <b>today</b> <b>s</b> regulations and industry structures are shaped in part by conditions put in place many years ago, and rationales for these rules are often ad-hoc and bear little relation to the reasons given {{at the beginning of the}} path. ...|$|R

40|$|Launched in {{the summer}} of 1992, TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P) was a joint mission between NASA and the Centre National d Etudes Spatiales (CNES), the French Space Agency, to make precise radar {{altimeter}} measurements of the ocean surface. After the remarkably successful 13 -years of mapping the ocean surface T/P lost its ability to maneuver and was de-commissioned January 2006. T/P revolutionized the study of the Earth s oceans by vastly exceeding pre-launch estimates of surface height accuracy recoverable from radar altimeter measurements. The precision orbit {{lies at the heart of}} the altimeter measurement providing the reference frame from which the radar altimeter measurements are made. The expected quality of orbit knowledge had limited the measurement accuracy expectations of past altimeter missions, and still remains a major component in the error budget of all altimeter missions. This paper describes critical improvements made to the T/P orbit time series over the 13 -years of precise orbit determination (POD) provided by the GSFC Space Geodesy Laboratory. The POD improvements from the pre-launch T/P expectation of radial orbit accuracy and Mission requirement of 13 -cm to an expected accuracy of about 1. 5 -cm <b>with</b> <b>today</b> <b>s</b> latest orbits will be discussed.

40|$|Integrity {{verification}} {{is essential}} to safe planning of wells. Although the complexity of wells has increased over the last decades, the process of integrity verification has not seen any significant changes. In {{order to reduce the}} number of engineering hours spent planning new wells, the work process, and corresponding engineering software needs improvements to be compatible <b>with</b> <b>today</b> <b>s</b> requirements. In this thesis, tubing stress analysis and casing wear simulations have been conducted for an High-Pressure High-Temperature (HPHT) well on the Norwegian continental shelf using the industry leading software tools. Both the work process and engineering software have been subject to investigations. The tubing sees excessive forces from high temperatures and high pressures in the well. In order to verify the integrity of the tubing, possible well scenarios are modelled in the Landmark WellCat software. As the production casing serves as a well barrier during production, it is of high importance that casing wear does not compromise the integrity of the casing. Petris DrillNET has been used to model wear from drilling operations on the casings. Improvements to the work process and engineering software are suggested in order to simplify the integrity modelling and reduce the engineering time spent on well planning. Based on the above mentioned work, the following points of improvement have been identified:- Implementation of standards and technical requirements in the engineering software. - Reduction of software input parameters through the establishment of a company specific database of parameters. - Need for improved communication between software models to reduce the iterative nature of well planning...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{challenges}} <b>with</b> <b>today</b> <b>s</b> ASIC designs {{is not necessarily the}} performance in terms of speed, but rather their power consumption. This is becoming increasingly important as the demands for mobile devices are growing rapidly. Almost all of the microchips fabricated today are base on a global clock synchronizing the on-chip activity; hence they are called clocked or synchronous circuits. The use of a global clock eases the design process as the designer can assume discreet time, thus only needing to focus on the functionality of the circuit. However, synchronous circuits tend to dissipate unnecessary power when idle, and the increasing complexity of today s microchips makes the clock tree harder to distribute evenly. Asynchronous circuits don t have a global clock tree spanning the entire circuit. Instead all activity is synchronized by using handshake protocols between different stages in the circuit. This gives asynchronous circuits some theoretical benefits that make them attractive. These benefits include: (1) lower power consumption, (2) no clock distribution or clock skew problems, (3) robustness towards variations in supply voltage, temperature and fabrication parameters. On the other hand, there are some drawback related with these circuits like area overhead associated with handshaking circuitry and the lack of EDA tools easing the design process. However, papers have recently started to appear in academia that show different ways of designing asynchronous circuits by using a design flow originally intended for synchronous circuits. This allows the designer to reuse synchronous designs and automatically convert them into their asynchronous counterpart, thus making the design process a whole lot easier. The main objective of this thesis has been to develop software which automatically converts a synchronous circuit into its asynchronous counterpart based on conversion techniques currently available in academia. The conversion tool has been designed in a way that allows it to be seamlessly integrated into a synchronous design flow, thus allowing for reuse of currently existing technology libraries. Several circuits have been converted and evaluated, including an 8 -bit CPU-core provided by Atmel...|$|E

40|$|When the {{production}} from a well {{is no longer}} profitable, the options are to either permanently plug and abandon (P&A) the well, or to re-use the slot by plugging the original well and sidetrack a new wellbore (slot recovery). The purpose of P&A is to establish permanent barriers to prevent migration of hydrocarbons to the surface, in a safe and cost-effective manner. In the coming years, there is an expectation of {{a significant increase in}} subsea wells needed to be plugged and abandon. <b>With</b> <b>today</b> <b>s</b> time consuming and expensive P&A operations, the industry desire new innovative methods able to reduce time and cost. The industry has today a large focus on technology that enables performing the plug and abandonment operation by light intervention vessels. In order for that to occur solving key challenges, such as tubing removal is required. The established approach to remove the tubing in subsea wells today is to use a semi-submersible drilling rig. The main objective for this project has been to investigate alternative methods for tubing removal. After an evaluation, the most promising alternative was the alternative method, tubing expansion with axial cuts. The method works by bisecting the tubing between the tubing couplings, axial cut one part, expand it and then pull the tubing parts together. Based on 12 m length between the couplings the method is able to create 5. 5 m window per operation. Performing the operation 6 times creates a window greater than 30 m and thus fulfilling NORSOK D- 10 minimum requirements for logged cement. If the logging shows acceptable cement bonding, the secondary plug can be set. To evaluate whether one, two or four axial cuts are optimal, An FE-analysis was carried out. Results from the analysis suggested two axial cuts with pressure applied by a mechanical tool only to the region around the cut are optimal. The operational steps and tools necessary to perform the operation have been assessed. By using a single-trip tool, it was estimated that the method would take approximately 21 hours to complete and be economically feasible for well lengths above 1445 m when the alternative is to pull with a semi-submersible drilling rig. Further work should be investigating the possibility of decreasing the axial cutting operation time. One option is to use two cutters simultaneously. Further, laboratory testing to confirm the FE-analysis and the expansion tool design should be carried out...|$|E
40|$|Digital {{games are}} very popular today and people {{spend a lot}} of time playing. Because it is fun and enjoyable to play, people get engaged and {{motivated}} while playing and would love to play more. The key to effective learning is to be engaged and motivated. But in traditional learning, it is usually hard to get learners engaged and motivated. What if we can introduce an engaging and innovative game concept into learning? What if some of the time people spend on playing digital games is used on learning? What if learning is just as engaging and motivating as playing? The aim of this study is to investigate: how a game concept can be used in doing homework/assignments; how such an application can be designed, implemented <b>with</b> <b>today</b> <b>s</b> technology; how the game-based learning software (Quiz Class) can be easily accessed, and how Quiz Class can influence students learning motivation. This project includes three parts.

The second part implements a digital game-based learning application (Quiz Class), deploy Quiz Class in the cloud, test it on end-uses, and improve it. The third part finds real classes, test, collect data and investigate how Quiz Class can influence students learning motivation. Finally, a game-based learning concept and a software architecture have been designed, Quiz Class has been implemented and tested. Quiz Class had 173 registered participants from a preliminary test and final test. The preliminary test had participants as groups and individuals. The final test was taking place in the software architecture course at NTNU, with 116 participants and 78 valid questionnaire responses. Multiple sources including interviews, observations, survey were used to collect data. The Quiz Class testing results showed that game-based learning application can be designed, implemented, and easily accessed. A game concept can be used in learning, and bringing a digital game into learning can boost learners motivation, engagement, and make learning fun. In addition, between 29 % to 41 % of students did the assignments again to improve themselves. Some students even repeated the assignment 9 times to make progress, and yet all the assignments were optional.

A análise de seus diários e os registros do processo de canonização mostram quanto seu modo de vida perseverante, marcado por períodos de jejum intenso, pela violência contra o próprio corpo e busca da santidade - sob os olhos complacentes da Igreja -, aproxima-a das pacientes com sintomas anoréxicos de hoje. A tese estabelece, também, um paralelo entre dois tipos de relação: o das santas e mártires do Cristianismo com a Igreja (a Santa Madre), e a das meninas anoréxicas com suas mães. Cúmplices em um projeto mortífero, essas duplas atendem ao apelo de um ideal de perfeição. Distantes umas das outras por vários séculos, apresentam os mesmos sintomas, manifestações de um superego atemporal transmitido através das gerações.

40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{study of the}} use of net-based meetings in learning across Sweden was carried out on behalf of the Swedish Net University Agency in co-operation with Sunet (Swedish University Computer Network). The goal {{of this study was to}} record, from a user perspective, the best practices in the area of net-based meetings from Sweden s universities and colleges. The {{preliminary study}} was undertaken during 2005 as a co-operation between The Centre for Distance-spanning technology at Luleå University of Technology (coordinator), Mid Sweden University, Umeå University and University of Trollhättan/Uddevalla. The starting point for the preliminary study was that existing learning management systems, often used by e. g. higher education, only support asynchronous communication. <b>With</b> <b>today</b> <b>s</b> computers and available broadband access it is much easier to provide support for real-time, synchronous communication. Each student can sit at home using her own computer and communicate over the Internet in real-time with teachers and other students. Until recently synchronous-tools for learning were not commonly used in higher education in Sweden, but there are good examples to be found. The preliminary study started with a questionnaire that was sent out to universities and colleges across Sweden. 124 replies were received and from these replies a number of teachers were chosen to be interviewed to gain a deeper insight into their use of net-based meetings in learning. It resulted in 13 interviews submitted to Sunet s service www. meetings. sunet. se, for management, updating and further development. The Sunet service for net-based meetings is focused on getting personnel and students who are connected to Sunet to use the net for meetings. Some examples of best-practices are: Without E-meetings we couldn't have held "remote labs" A complete teacher training course through distance learning English for the manufacturing industry Best-practice in details [URL] The preliminary study also resulted in the suggestion of four different development areas to increase the usage of net-based meetings for educational purposes: o Disseminate information on the usage of net-based meetings, o Stimulate the development of more good examples, o Establish a network of experts/interest within the Swedish Net University Agency and o Evaluate student-experience a workshop, to be arranged by the Swedish Net University Agency together with SUNET and the Swedish society for e-competence (REK) among others.

This should mean that we only have seen the beginning of many innovative and useful ways {{of the use of}} net-based meetings in higher education. We believe it is an absolute necessity to cooperate at both national and international level to better understand technology-supported learning and to strengthen the development of new methods and technical solutions to be used in higher education...|$|E
40|$|Transplantation of the islets of Langerhans as a {{treatment}} for type 1 diabetes (T 1 DM) is a procedure still under development. For the last decade it has been possible to obtain insulin independence by repeated infusions of islets. However, most patients must resume insulin therapy in 2 - 3 years. The side effects associated <b>with</b> <b>today</b> <b>s</b> immunosuppressive medication limit the procedure to patients with severe and frequent episodes of hypoglycemia or to T 1 DM patients who need immunosuppressive medication for other reasons, e. g. due to previous kidney transplantation. The efficacy and long term results of islet transplantation need to be improved for the treatment to be considered for also other categories of patients. In this thesis a new technique, the two-layer method (TLM), to avoid hypoxic damage to the pancreas during the period of cold storage between donor operation and islet isolation was evaluated. PET/CT was introduced in a preclinical large animal model of islet transplantation and thereafter used to study the early post-transplantation phase of clinical islet transplantation. Finally, a new ratio, delta CP/GCr, was used to evaluate short term outcomes of repeated clinical islet transplantations. No significant differences could be seen in islet isolation yield or islet transplantation outcomes using TLM compared to conventional cold storage. When utilizing PET/CT to monitor the transplantation of [18 F]-FDG labeled islets, these were heterogeneously spread in the liver, with fractions of the graft found in hot spots. At least 25 % of the radioactivity contained within the islets was lost during the transplantation indicating significant early damage to the graft, possibly due to the instant blood mediated inflammatory reaction (IBMIR). Evaluating the clinical outcome of 110 transplantations, we showed that a large islet graft, a high stimulation index and short cold ischemia time (CIT) were factors that significantly improved clinical outcome. No correlation was found between initial renal graft function and the outcome of islet transplantation from the same donor. This thesis has investigated areas where improvements must be made for islet transplantation to reach higher efficacy and become {{a treatment}} modality for more patients. The need for repeated islet infusions has made it difficult to study the effect of each islet preparation. Tools have here been introduced to facilitate this individual evaluation. Factors that predict the clinical outcome have been identified. Findings include the importance of CIT. New methods to preserve the pancreas before isolation are needed to improve outcome of both isolation and transplantation. A large fraction of islets implanted is lost during transplantation. The presented PET/CT technique may be used to further characterize early post-transplantation events and can become an important instrument in evaluation of new methods to enhance initial islet survival...|$|E

The refinery has indicated plans for yet another combined heat and power plant. This leads to a possibility of synergy effects by integration between the refinery, Energiverk Mongstad and the new plant. The thesis studies three options to provide the refinery with hydrogen and gaining synergy effects by integrating the hydrogen production with a new combined heat and power plant. The first option is to recycle the fuel gas stream in the refinery. The total potential for recycling hydrogen from this stream is 2. 4 ton/h of hydrogen. The fuel gas will be utilized in Energiverk Mongstad, and the hydrogen in the stream will be recovered by use of membrane process. The increased need for hydrogen is however estimated to be 4 ton/h and the recycling from the fuel gas stream is seen as a supplementary solution. The two latter options are two different configurations of the new combined heat and power plants for heat, power and hydrogen production in addition to CO 2 capture. The first alternative is a pre combustion CO 2 capture solution where the natural gas is reformed by auto thermal reforming into a synthesis gas. The CO 2 is removed prior to combustion. The plant has an export of 4 ton/h hydrogen before the rest of the synthesis gas is utilized for power production. The second alternative is based on conventional technology where the natural gas is combusted directly and the CO 2 is removed post combustion. This case is included with an external hydrogen production unit. Both cases are projected to deliver 120 MW low pressure steam for CO 2 capture in Energiverk Mongstad The two combined heat and power plants are modelled and simulated in HYSYS. The simulation shows that the post combustion case has an efficiency of 59 % and the pre combustion case has an efficiency of 56 %. This is due to higher electricity production in the post case. The efficiency for both cases will increase when the hydrogen or steam production increase. The two combined heat and power plants are compared economically by the net present value method. <b>With</b> <b>today</b> <b>s</b> prices of natural gas and electricity, none of the alternatives are profitable. With rice in electricity prices and a decline of natural gas prices they will both become economically viable although the post combustion case reaches break-even before the pre combustion case. </p...|$|E

40|$|In <b>today</b> <b>s</b> {{shipbuilding}} industry, {{companies are}} looking to make their design process more efficient so they can have more economically viable and faster lead-times on their ships. Much of <b>today</b> <b>s</b> shipbuilding is being done through customized design, and companies like the Ulstein Group evolve new designs from previously performed engineering. Recent research projects like SUSPRO are doing studies on how to implement more standardized design to move the customer order decoupling point further along the process to ease and speed up future design. This thesis gives a theoretical insight and adds to this effort by suggesting product configurators and knowledge-based engineering (KBE) {{in accordance with the}} principles of set-based concurrent engineering (SBCE). It suggests two separate product configurators and looks into why it is important to store knowledge within a company. The work concludes with general tips for implementation of SBCE in shipbuilding companies...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a summary of}} conclusions from the Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) Higher Volume Operations (HVO) Flight Experiment which NASA conducted to determine pilot acceptability of the HVO concept for normal conditions. The SATS HVO concept improves efficiency at non-towered, non-radar airports in Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC) while achieving a level of safety equal to <b>today</b> <b>s</b> system. Reported are results from flight experiment data that indicate that the SATS HVO concept is viable. The success of the SATS HVO concept is based on acceptable pilot workload, performance, and subjective criteria {{when compared to the}} procedural control operations in use today at non-towered, non-radar controlled airfields in IMC. The HVO Flight Experiment, flown on NASA's Cirrus SR 22, used a subset of the HVO Simulation Experiment scenarios and evaluation pilots in order to validate the simulation experiment results. HVO and Baseline (<b>today</b> <b>s</b> system) scenarios flown included: single aircraft arriving for a GPS non-precision approach; aircraft arriving for the approach with multiple traffic aircraft; and aircraft arriving for the approach with multiple traffic aircraft and then conducting a missed approach. Results reveal that all twelve low-time instrument-rated pilots preferred SATS HVO when compared to current procedural separation operations. These pilots also flew the HVO procedures safely and proficiently without additional workload in comparison to <b>today</b> <b>s</b> system (Baseline). Detailed results of pilot flight technical error, and their subjective assessments of workload and situation awareness are presented in this paper...|$|R
