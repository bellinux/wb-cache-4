5|$|A common {{complaint}} regarding Halo 2s online play <b>was</b> <b>widespread</b> cheating, {{which began}} occurring {{almost immediately after}} the game's release.

50|$|L. cervus <b>is</b> <b>widespread</b> across Europe, {{though it}} is absent from Ireland. In Germany it <b>is</b> <b>widespread,</b> mainly in the south. In Hungary this species <b>is</b> <b>widespread</b> in the hilly and mountainous areas. In Romania it <b>is</b> <b>widespread,</b> {{especially}} in the hilly areas with sun exposed slopes. It also occurs in the European part of Turkey. In Italy it is mainly distributed in northern and central regions. In Spain and Portugal it is present only in the northern half of each country. In Britain it is largely confined to the south-east of England, where it <b>is</b> <b>widespread.</b> This species <b>is</b> now extinct in Denmark and Latvia. It {{is also found in}} Caucasus, Asia Minor, Syria and west Kazakhstan. Its range is currently only increasing in Croatia and Slovakia.|$|R
5|$|Agriculture damage <b>was</b> <b>widespread.</b> Across {{the country}} 40% of the {{sugarcane}} crop, 80–100% of the banana crop, 75% {{of the coffee}} trees under three years old, and 20% of {{the top layer of}} the cocoa crop were lost to the storm. Insured damage in Jamaica was initially estimated at around US$1.5billion, but post-storm analysis showed that it was closer to US$310million.|$|E
5|$|By 2005 the World Medical Association had {{specifically}} {{demanded that}} China cease using prisoners as organ donors.

5|$|Regardless, {{the book}} was {{certainly}} at Kells in the 12th century, when land charters pertaining to the Abbey of Kells were copied onto some of its blank pages. The practice of copying of charters into important books <b>was</b> <b>widespread</b> in the medieval period, and such inscriptions in the Book of Kells provide concrete evidence about its location at the time.|$|E
5|$|The pail {{system was}} used {{throughout}} Europe, in French {{cities such as}} Marseille and Le Havre, and English towns and cities such as Leeds, Birmingham, and Manchester, but it was popular {{in the town of}} Rochdale, from which the Rochdale system of pail collection took its name. It <b>was</b> <b>widespread</b> in Australia too.|$|E
5|$|The quake {{was felt}} across {{more than a}} dozen U.S. states and in several Canadian provinces, and was felt by more people than any other quake in U.S. history. No deaths and only minor {{injuries}} were reported. Minor and moderate damage to buildings <b>was</b> <b>widespread</b> and was estimated by one risk-modeling company at $200million to $300million, of which about $100million was insured.|$|E

Eight students had been killed ten months before in the Jokela school shooting in southern Finland.|$|E
5|$|This {{species has}} bred in Iceland since about 1999, and <b>was</b> <b>widespread</b> by 2004, {{although}} numbers {{are affected by}} hard winters. Breeds occurs intermittently in the Faroes. The goldcrest has occurred as a vagrant in Jordan and Morocco.|$|E
5|$|Although Maryland {{remained}} in the Union, secessionist sentiment {{and support for the}} Confederacy <b>was</b> <b>widespread</b> in that state. Colonel Jones therefore expected a violent reception in Baltimore. He was also concerned about the possibility of sabotage to the tracks on the way to Baltimore which might cause derailment and potentially large casualties for the 6th Massachusetts. Jones ordered that a pilot locomotive precede the train that transported his regiment. The 6th Massachusetts arrived safely in Baltimore about 10 a.m.|$|E

5|$|Another issue {{concerned}} {{the election of}} the president. Few agreed with Madison that the executive should be elected by the legislature. There <b>was</b> <b>widespread</b> concern with direct election, because information diffused so slowly in the late 18th century, and because of concerns that people would only vote for candidates from their state or region. A vocal minority wanted the national executive to be chosen by the governors of the states.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists have {{established}} that the monument was built by pastoralist communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to Britain from continental Europe. Although representing part of an architectural tradition of long barrow building that <b>was</b> <b>widespread</b> across Neolithic Europe, Addington Long Barrow belongs to a localised regional variant of barrows produced {{in the vicinity of}} the River Medway, now known as the Medway Megaliths. Of these, it lies near to both Chestnuts Long Barrow and Coldrum Long Barrow on the western side of the river. Three further surviving long barrows, Kit's Coty House, the Little Kit's Coty House, and the Coffin Stone, are located on the Medway's eastern side.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle studied locusts {{and their}} {{breeding}} habits and Livy recorded a devastating plague in Capua in 203 BC. He mentioned human epidemics following locust plagues which he {{associated with the}} stench from the putrifying corpses; the linking of human disease outbreaks to locust plagues <b>was</b> <b>widespread.</b> A pestilence in China in 311 AD that killed 98% of the population locally was blamed on locusts, {{and may have been}} caused by an increase in numbers of rats (and their fleas) that devoured the locust carcases.|$|E
50|$|Philodromus aureolus <b>is</b> <b>widespread</b> {{in western}} and central Europe, {{including}} Ireland. The species <b>is</b> <b>widespread</b> {{in most of}} Britain but is more localised {{in the west and}} north.

5|$|At Brooklyn, {{still an}} {{independent}} city from New York, houses were dismantled and uprooted trees blocked streets. Damage <b>was</b> <b>widespread</b> {{throughout the area}} and flood waters reached waist-high levels. The storm was the most severe in years at Jersey City, New Jersey, {{despite the fact that}} its damage was moderate. Trees were blown down and cellars filled with water there and in nearby areas, such as Hoboken.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{relatively}} weak and disorganized nature of the storm, impact throughout its path <b>was</b> <b>widespread,</b> but not particularly severe. Puerto Rico bore {{the brunt of the}} storm, followed by the United States Virgin Islands, then the Dominican Republic. Debby was attributed to about $735,000 in damage and 1indirect fatality, which occurred in Puerto Rico when a man fell off a roof while attempting to remove a satellite dish.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1938 and {{throughout}} World War II, the SS enacted a procedure where offices and {{units of the}} SS could form smaller sub-units, known as SS-Sonderkommandos, to carry out special tasks, including large-scale murder operations. The use of SS-Sonderkommandos <b>was</b> <b>widespread.</b> According to former SS Sturmbannführer Wilhelm Höttl, not even the SS leadership knew how many SS-Sonderkommandos were constantly being formed, disbanded, and reformed for various tasks, especially on the Eastern Front.|$|E
