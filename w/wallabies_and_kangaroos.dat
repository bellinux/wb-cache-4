50|$|The {{southern}} and western coasts {{of the island}} lie within the Phillip Island Important Bird Area, so identified by BirdLife International because of its importance in supporting significant populations of fairy penguins, short-tailed shearwaters and Pacific gulls. In addition, there is a wildlife park where <b>wallabies</b> <b>and</b> <b>kangaroos</b> roam freely amongst the visitors and can be fed by hand. Seal Rocks, at {{the western end of}} the island, hosts the largest colony of fur seals in Australia (up to 16,000). In recent years, other than local population of critically endangered endemic Burrunan dolphins or migratory killer whales, southern right whales and humpback whales are starting to show recoveries in the area long after commercial and illegal hunts by the Soviet Union with the help of Japan in 1970s, and the numbers using the area as nursery are growing rapidly, allowing a rise in hopes to establish commercial whale watching activities {{in the vicinity of the}} island.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine hind limb scaling of the {{musculoskeletal}} system in the Macropodoidea, the superfamily containing <b>wallabies</b> <b>and</b> <b>kangaroos,</b> to re-examine the effect of size on the locomotor mechanics and physiology of marsupial hopping. Morphometric musculoskeletal analyses were conducted of 15 species and skeletal specimens of 21 species spanning a size range from 0. 8 to 80 kg that included representatives of 12 of the 16 extant genera of macropodoids. We found that unlike other groups, macropodoids are able to match force demands associated with increasing body size primarily through a combination of positive allometry in muscle area and muscle moment arms. Isometric scaling of primary hind limb bones suggests, however, that larger species experience relatively greater bone stresses. Muscle to tendon area ratios of the ankle extensors scale with strong positive allometry, indicating that peak tendon stresses also increase with increasing body size but to a lesser degree than previously reported. Consistent with previous morphological and experimental studies, large macropodoids are therefore better suited for elastic strain energy recovery but operate at lower safety factors, which likely poses an upper limit to body size. Scaling patterns for extant macropodoids suggest that extinct giant kangaroos (~ 250 kg) were likely limited in locomotor capacityC. P. McGowan, J. Skinner, A. A. Biewene...|$|E
40|$|Background: Forestomach {{fermentation}} in Australian marsupials such as <b>wallabies</b> <b>and</b> <b>kangaroos,</b> though {{analogous to}} rumen fermentation, results in lower methane emissions. Insights into hydrogenotrophy in these systems could help in devising strategies to reduce ruminal methanogenesis. Reductive acetogenesis {{may be a}} significant hydrogen sink in these systems and previous molecular analyses have revealed a novel diversity of putative acetogens in the tammar wallaby forestomach. Results: Methanogen-inhibited enrichment cultures prepared from tammar wallaby forestomach contents consumed hydrogen and produced primarily acetate. Functional gene (formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase and acetyl-CoA synthase) analyses revealed a restricted diversity of Clostridiales species as the putative acetogens in the cultures. A new acetogen (growth on H- 2 /CO 2 with acetate as primary end product) designated isolate TWA 4, {{was obtained from the}} cultures. Isolate TWA 4 classified within the Lachnospiraceae and demonstrated > 97 % rrs identity to previously isolated kangaroo acetogens. Isolate TWA 4 was a potent hydrogenotroph and demonstrated excellent mixotrophic growth (concomitant consumption of hydrogen during heterotrophic growth) with glycerol. Mixotrophic growth of isolate TWA 4 on glycerol resulted in increased cell densities and acetate production compared to autotrophic growth. Co-cultures with an autotrophic methanogen Methanobrevibacter smithii revealed that isolate TWA 4 performed reductive acetogenesis under high hydrogen concentration (> 5 mM), but not at low concentrations. Under heterotrophic growth conditions, isolate TWA 4 did not significantly stimulate methanogenesis in a co-culture with M. smithii contrary to the expectation for organisms growing fermentatively. Conclusions: The unique properties of tammar wallaby acetogens might be contributing factors to reduced methanogen numbers and methane emissions from tammar wallaby forestomach fermentation, compared to ruminal fermentation. The macropod forestomach may be a useful source of acetogens for future strategies to reduce methane emissions from ruminants, particularly if these strategies also include some level of methane suppression and/or acetogen stimulation, for example by harnessing mixotrophic growth capabilitie...|$|E

40|$|First {{published}} online: December 18, 2014 Understanding {{the evolution}} of Australia's extinct marsupial megafauna has been hindered by a relatively incomplete fossil record and convergent or highly specialized morphology, which confound phylogenetic analyses. Further, the harsh Australian climate and early date of most megafaunal extinctions (39 - 52 ka) means {{that the vast majority}} of fossil remains are unsuitable for ancient DNA analyses. Here, we apply cross-species DNA capture to fossils from relatively high latitude, high altitude caves in Tasmania. Using low-stringency hybridization and high-throughput sequencing, we were able to retrieve mitochondrial sequences from two extinct megafaunal macropodid species. The two specimens, Simosthenurus occidentalis (giant short-faced kangaroo) and Protemnodon anak (giant wallaby), have been radiocarbon dated to 46 - 50 and 40 - 45 ka, respectively. This is significantly older than any Australian fossil that has previously yielded DNA sequence information. Processing the raw sequence data from these samples posed a bioinformatic challenge due to the poor preservation of DNA. We explored several approaches in order to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio in retained sequencing reads. Our findings demonstrate the critical importance of adopting stringent processing criteria when distant outgroups are used as references for mapping highly fragmented DNA. Based on the most stringent nucleotide data sets (879 bp for S. occidentalis and 2, 383 bp for P. anak), total-evidence phylogenetic analyses confirm that macropodids consist of three primary lineages: Sthenurines such as Simosthenurus (extinct short-faced kangaroos), the macropodines (all other <b>wallabies</b> <b>and</b> <b>kangaroos),</b> and the enigmatic living banded hare-wallaby Lagostrophus fasciatus (Lagostrophinae). Protemnodon emerges as a close relative of Macropus (large living kangaroos), a position not supported by recent morphological phylogenetic analyses. Bastien Llamas, Paul Brotherton, Kieren J.

40|$|Spectacled hare {{wallabies}} (Lagwckstes mpici l la tus) have a basal {{metabolic rate}} (0. 32 cma 02 *g-'-h-') that is about 70 % of the value that would be anticipated for most eutherian mammals of corresponding size (2. 66 kg). The body temperature and heart rate of these marsupials are also relatively low by eutherian standards. Lagor-chesles regulates its body temperature well in environments as cool as 6 C, relying on augmented heat production and heat conservation resulting from effective insulation and peripheral heterothermy involving the tail and distal portion of the limbs. The minimal heat-transfer coefficient for this wallaby is 1. 1 kcal (m 2. h. C) - 1, a value similar t o those reported for other macropodids. Hare wallabies cope with heat stress {{by a combination of}} controlled hyperthermia and evaporative cooling. The latter involves panting; breathing rates exceeding 400 cycles/min were noted in individuals tested in environments a t 43 C. Panting resulted in a slight increase in blood pH after 2 - 4 h. Licking behavior also appears to contribute to evaporative water output a t high temperatures. Cutaneous water loss is not a n important component of this out-put, a t least in the resting animals utilized in this study. Hare wallabies are nocturnal in nature and spend the day protected from solar radiation and high air temperatures within shelter provided by porcupine grass (Triodiu angush). Behavior thus serves t o minimize requirements for evaporative output of water on hot days. The physiological performance of the hare wallaby is compared with that of the jackrabbit, an animal of similar size and ecology occupying North American deserts.

40|$|This thesis {{endeavors to}} {{demonstrate}} a link between centromere composition and chromosome evolution. The Macropodinae marsupials (<b>wallabies</b> <b>and</b> <b>kangaroos)</b> are uniquely amenable to such study because they have experienced a recent species radiation accompanied by broad karyotypic divergence. To determine whether centromere sequence composition follows the phylogenetic history of species evolution or follows patterns of convergent breakpoint reuse through chromosome evolution, we examined the phylogenetic trajectory of the three representative centromere probes isolated from Macropus rufogriseus. ^ The constitution of the centromeric portions of the sex chromosomes of the red-necked wallaby, Macropus rufogriseus (family Macropodidae), was first investigated to develop {{an overview of the}} sequence composition of centromeres within a single marsupial genome. Sequence and cytogenetic analyses of three representative clones showed that they localize specifically to centromeric heterochromatin, yet differ in copy number and intrachromosomal distribution. Immunocytohistochemistry assays defined a restricted, point localization of the functional centromere within the enlarged, pericentric and heterochromatic regions of the M. rufogriseus centromeres. This study identified constituents of the M. rufogriseus chromosomes and developed a more comprehensive overview of the composition of a marsupial centromere. ^ In the second portion of the study the three M. rufogriseus centromere probes were localized to nine species within the Macropus genus. The localization of the three probes was compared with the phylogenetic history of a mitochondrial gene, Cyt b, a nuclear gene, TRSP, and the chromosomal histories of the syntenic blocks that define the different karyotype arrangements. Convergent contraction or expansion of predominant centromere satellites was found to accompany specific karyotype rearrangements. The phylogenetic history of these centromere sequences displayed the convergence of centromere composition in divergent species through convergent breakpoint reuse between syntenic blocks. These data support the 2 ̆ 2 library hypothesis 2 ̆ 2 of centromere evolution within this genus as each species possess the same satellites yet has experienced differential expansion and contraction of these satellites. Thus, we have identified a correlation between the evolution of centromere satellite sequences, the reuse of syntenic break points, and karyotype convergence {{in the context of a}} gene-based phylogeny. ...|$|E

40|$|Ngaingan virus (NGAV) was {{isolated}} from {{a pool of}} biting midges that were collected in the tropics of northern Australia. Reported here is the full-length sequence of the NGAV genome, which, at over 15. 7  kb, is the largest in any rhabdovirus described to date and contains 13 genes, the highest number of genes observed in any (-) ssRNA virus. Seven of these putative genes show no significant homology to known proteins. Like viruses in the genus Ephemerovirus, NGAV possesses a second glycoprotein gene (G). Phylogenetic analyses, however, place NGAV within the yet to be classified "Hart Park" group containing Wongabel and Flanders viruses, which do not contain a second glycoprotein gene.
