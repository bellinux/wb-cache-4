40|$|The {{different}} ways in which industries are described and researched using historical or archaeological evidence are highlighted. The differing pictures which emerge for the production of small wound <b>wire</b> <b>headed</b> copper alloy pins in England the late- and post-medieval period are used to exemplify the problem. The historical records indicate a turbulent industry, with initially localized craft manufacture in English towns, being swamped from the sixteenth century by a wave of imports from the continent. However, the world's major pin producing industry was subsequently founded in organized semi-automated manufactories which evolved in England during the eighteenth century. This picture contrasts with the archaeological evidence of a slow typological development of the pin head form, and gradual reduction in the pin's metrical parameters. A similar gradual development is noted in the elemental composition of the copper alloy from which the pins were made. No archaeological evidence of imports is discernible, though the changes in manufacturing technique are clearly recorded. The need to evolve a more rounded picture of industries using a variety of forms of evidence is thus emphasized...|$|R

40|$|In {{the field}} of laser {{additive}} manufacturing, modern hybrid technologies offer advantageous solutions for combining the high quality level of laser surface claddings with the industry's economical requirements regarding productivity and energy efficiency. The technical approach is to supply energy sources in two fundamentally different ways. First, welding material {{in the form of}} wire is directly heated, i. e., by electrical resistance, almost to its melting point and is fed to the process region simultaneously with the laser beam. A newly developed coaxial <b>wire</b> <b>head</b> allows for omni-directional welding operation and, thus, the use of wire even for complex surface claddings as well as layer-by-layer fabrication of metallic parts. Second, an additional energy source is used to heat the substrate in order to compensate for the heat conduction losses. This technical variant is suitable for use with both wire and powder as deposition materials. Additionally, heating and cooling gradients can be precisely adjusted, thus improving the build-up of structures of hard and brittle metallic super-alloys. Currently, deposition rates up to 18 kg/h of metal alloys and metal matrix composites have been demonstrated using these laser hybrid techniques. Industrial applications are, among others, large hydraulic cylinders and tools of the oil and mining industries...|$|R
40|$|The vestibulo-collic reflex (VCR) {{attempts}} to stabilize head position in space during {{motion of the}} body. Similar to the better-studied vestibulo-ocular reflex, the VCR is subserved by relatively direct, as well as indirect pathways linking vestibular nerve activity to cervical motor neurons. We measured the VCR using an electromagnetic technique often employed to measure eye movements; we attached a loop of <b>wire</b> (<b>head</b> coil) to an animal’s head using an adhesive; then the animal was gently restrained with its head free to move within an electromagnetic field, and was subjected to sinusoidal (0. 5 – 3  Hz) or abrupt angular acceleration (peak velocity approximately 200 °/s). Head rotation opposite in direction to body rotation {{was assumed to be}} driven by the VCR. To confirm that the compensatory head movements were in fact vestibular in origin, we plugged the horizontal canal unilaterally and then retested the animals 2, 8 and 15  days after the lesion. Two days after surgery, the putative VCR was almost absent in response to abrupt or sinusoidal rotations. Recovery commenced by day 8 and was nearly complete by day 15. We conclude that the compensatory head movements are vestibular in origin produced by the VCR. Similar to other species, there are robust compensatory mechanisms that restore the VCR following peripheral lesions...|$|R
