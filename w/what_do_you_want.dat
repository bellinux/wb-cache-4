[...] often said following adult humor, Wakko's [...] "Faboo!" [...] and Dot's frequent assertions of her cuteness. The most prominent catchphrase that was said by all the Warners was [...] "Hello-o-o, nurse!" [...] Tom Ruegger said that the [...] "Hello-o-o, Nurse!" [...] line {{was intended to be}} a catchphrase much like Bugs Bunny's line, [...] "What's up, doc?" [...] Before the theme song for each [...] "Pinky and the Brain" [...] segment, Pinky asks, [...] "Gee, Brain, <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> to do tonight?" [...] Brain replies, [...] "The same thing we do every night, Pinky: try to take over the world!" [...] During these episodes, Brain often asks Pinky, [...] "Are you pondering what I'm pondering?" [...] and Pinky replies with a silly non sequitur. Writer Peter Hastings said that he unintentionally created these catchphrases when he wrote the episode [...] "Win Big," [...] and then Producer Sherri Stoner used them and had them put into later episodes.|$|E

2500|$|The apparitions of Our Lady of Good Help were {{reported}} by Adele Brise in 1859. In December 2010, Bishop David L. Ricken of Green Bay, Wisconsin approved the apparition as worthy of belief, as the first Marian apparition approved in the United States at the local level. In Robinsonville (now called Champion) WI, a young Belgian immigrant woman named Adele Brise was walking through a wooded area when she saw a beautiful woman standing between a maple and a hemlock tree. She saw the lady again {{on her way to}} Mass, and walked past her again. After Mass she told her priest about the apparition, and he told her to ask the Lady [...] "In God's name, who are you and <b>what</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> of me?" [...] When Adele walked past the spot again, the Lady was there, and Adele asked what she was told by the priest. The Lady replied, [...] "I am the Queen of Heaven who prays for the conversion of sinners." [...] She gave Adele the mission to teach the children of the area their Catechism, which Adele did faithfully. Soon after, Adele's father built a small chapel between the trees, and later two more churches were built on the spot before the present brick church, built in 1942. The apparitions, attributed to Our Lady of Good Help, were approved on December 8, 2010, by Bishop David L. Ricken of the Diocese of Green Bay.|$|E
