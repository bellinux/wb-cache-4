5|$|Knowing Superman {{could stop}} his plan, Luthor lures {{him to an}} {{underground}} lair, reveals his plan and exposes him to Kryptonite. As Superman weakens, Luthor further taunts him by revealing the first missile is headed toward Hackensack, New Jersey, as even Superman cannot stop both impacts. Eve Teschmacher, Luthor's accomplice, is horrified because her mother lives in Hackensack, but Luthor does not care and leaves Superman to a slow death. Knowing his reputation for keeping his word, Teschmacher rescues Superman on the condition he <b>will</b> <b>deal</b> with the New Jersey missile first. After Superman diverts the missile into outer space, the other one explodes near the San Andreas Fault. He mitigates {{the effects of the}} explosion, getting rid of the fallout and shoring up the crumbling Earth, but the aftershocks damage the Golden Gate Bridge and cause the Hollywood Sign and the Hoover Dam to collapse, endangering lives.|$|E
5|$|Suharto (Amoroso Katamsi), awoken {{early in}} the morning, denies Untung's announcement, stating {{explicitly}} {{that there is no}} Generals' Council and making an adjunct record notes on the true nature of G30S. As there is a power vacuum with Yani dead, Suharto takes temporary control of the Army and begins planning a counter-assault with his men; he is, however, unwilling to force a fight. He instead states that he will give a radio announcement, which is delivered after forces loyal to him retake the RRI office; it outlines the situation, describes G30S as counter-revolutionary, and states that the Army <b>will</b> <b>deal</b> with the coup. The G30S leaders flee Halim, and Suharto's troops retake the air base. Some time later, forces under Suharto's leadership attack a G30S/PKI headquarters. While PKI-affiliated soldiers fight, the Party leadership escapes and separates, planning to continue their struggle underground.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{the crew}} {{are unaware of}} the loop. However, Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) begins to hear noises before she goes to bed {{following}} the poker game. Having a sense of déjà vu during the poker game and able to predict the cards Data <b>will</b> <b>deal</b> during a subsequent loop, Crusher takes a tricorder with her to her room, records the voices, and later analyzes them to discover they are the panicked commands and broadcasts of the crew. The senior staff work out that they are stuck in the loop; the voices they are hearing are those of themselves from the previous loop {{just prior to the}} destruction of the ship. They evaluate the voices to determine that the loop is restarted due to the collision of the two ships but {{do not know how to}} avoid that collision in the first place. Data suggests that his positronic brain can be used to send a short message to himself in the next loop which may help them to avoid the collision. When they arrive at the anomaly, and after the collision, Data sends the message.|$|E

This would suggest the Umkhonto VLS (vertical launch system) can accommodate missiles capable of medium ranges and area defence (the current Umkhonto-IR is, by contrast, a short-range point-defence system.

Instead, he will cover the period from the civil wars of the Year of Four Emperors and end with the despotism of the Flavians. Only the first four books and twenty-six {{chapters}} of the fifth book survive, covering the year 69 and the first part of 70. The work is believed to have continued up to the death of Domitian on September 18, 96. The fifth book containsas a prelude to the account of Titus's suppression of the Great Jewish Revolta short ethnographic survey of the ancient Jews, and it is an invaluable record of Roman attitudes towards them.|$|E

25|$|As {{children}} reach adolescence, {{the period}} of time between age 13 and 19, the dynamics of the parent-child relationship change as peer groups are now the focus of attention. An adolescent with cleft lip or cleft palate <b>will</b> <b>deal</b> with the typical challenges faced by most of their peers including issues related to self-esteem, dating and social acceptance. Adolescents, however, view appearance as the most important characteristic, above intelligence and humor. This being the case, adolescents are susceptible to additional problems because they cannot hide their facial differences from their peers. Adolescent boys typically deal with issues relating to withdrawal, attention, thought, and internalizing problems, and may possibly develop anxiousness-depression and aggressive behaviors. Adolescent girls are more likely to develop problems relating to self-concept and appearance. Individuals with cleft lip or cleft palate often deal with threats to their quality of life for multiple reasons including: unsuccessful social relationships, deviance in social appearance and multiple surgeries.|$|E
25|$|A crowd mills {{about before}} the Cathedral of the Intercession (the Temple of Vasiliy the Blessed) in Red Square. Many are beggars, and policemen {{occasionally}} appear. A {{group of men}} enters, discussing the anathema the deacon had declared on Grishka (Grigoriy) Otrepyev in the mass. They identify Grishka as the Tsarevich. With growing excitement they sing of the advance of his forces to Kromï, of his intent to retake his father's throne, and of the defeat he <b>will</b> <b>deal</b> to the Godunovs. A yuródivïy enters, pursued by urchins. He sings a nonsensical song ("The moon is flying, the kitten is crying"). The urchins greet him and rap on his metal hat. The yuródivïy has a kopek, which the urchins promptly steal. He whines pathetically. Boris and his retinue exit the Cathedral. The boyars distribute alms. In a powerful chorus ("Benefactor father... Give us bread!"), the hungry people beg for bread. As the chorus subsides, the yuródivïy's cries are heard. Boris asks why he cries. The yuródivïy reports the theft of his kopek and asks Boris to order the boys' slaughter, {{just as he did}} {{in the case of the}} Tsarevich. Shuysky wants the yuródivïy seized, but Boris instead asks for the holy man's prayers. As Boris exits, the yuródivïy declares that the Mother of God will not allow him to pray for Tsar Herod (see Massacre of the Innocents). The yuródivïy then sings his lament ("Flow, flow, bitter tears!") about the fate of Russia.|$|E

500|$|Jack is bisexual, and is {{the first}} {{televised}} Doctor Who character to be openly anything other than heterosexual.

[...] Within Doctor Whos narrative, Jack's sexual orientation is not specifically labelled as that could [...] "make it an issue". On creating Jack, Davies comments [...] "I thought: 'It's time you introduce bisexuals properly into mainstream television,'" [...] with a focus on making Jack fun and swashbuckling as opposed to negative and angsty. Davies also expresses that he didn't make the character bisexual [...] "from any principle", but rather because [...] "it would be interesting from a narrative point of view." [...] The bisexuality-related labels [...] "pansexual" [...] and [...] "omnisexual" [...] are also frequently applied to the character. Writer Steven Moffat suggests that questions of sexual orientation do not even enter into Jack's mind; Moffat also comments [...] "It felt right that the James Bond of the future would bed anyone." [...] Within Torchwood, the character refers to sexual orientation classifications as [...] "quaint". In an interview with the Chicago Tribune, John Barrowman explained that [...] "’s bisexual, but {{in the realm of the}} show, we call him omnisexual, because on the show, [...] also have sex with aliens who take human form, and sex with male-male, women-women, all sorts of combinations."
