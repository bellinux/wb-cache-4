Poor's Field and Tartleton's Lake in Ruislip {{are also}} part of the reserve.

5|$|Additional beads {{are awarded}} to <b>Wood</b> Badgers who serve {{as part of}} a <b>Wood</b> Badge {{training}} team. One additional bead is awarded to each Assistant Leader Trainer (<b>Wood</b> Badge staff) and two additional beads are awarded to each Leader Trainer (<b>Wood</b> Badge course directors), for a total of four.|$|E
5|$|After {{completion}} of the <b>Wood</b> Badge course, participants are awarded the insignia in a <b>Wood</b> Badge bead ceremony. They receive automatic membership in 1st Gilwell Park Scout Group or Gilwell Troop 1. These leaders are henceforth called Gilwellians or <b>Wood</b> Badgers. It is estimated that worldwide over 100,000 Scouters have completed their <b>Wood</b> Badge training. The 1st Gilwell Scout Group meets annually during the first weekend in September at Gilwell Park for the Gilwell Reunion. Gilwell Reunions are also held in other places, often on that same weekend.|$|E

5|$|Although the <b>wood</b> {{recovered}} from the Levels was visually intact, it was extremely degraded and very soft. Where possible, pieces of <b>wood</b> in good condition, or the worked ends of pegs, were taken away and conserved for later analysis. The conservation process involved keeping the <b>wood</b> in heated tanks in a solution of polyethylene glycol and, by a process of evaporation, gradually replacing {{the water in the}} <b>wood</b> with the wax over a period of about nine months. After this treatment the <b>wood</b> was removed from the tank and wiped clean. As the wax cooled and hardened, the artefact became firm and could be handled freely.|$|E
5|$|Among {{these was}} an {{experimental}} <b>Wood</b> Badge course in Monterey in 1968. Bánáthy was Course Director, Joe St. Clair served as Scoutmaster, and Fran Petersen was senior patrol leader. John Larson, National Director of Education, was also present. All attendees {{were asked to}} bring their entire troop to a single week of summer camp, allowing the <b>Wood</b> Badge staff to use the summer camp as an application for <b>Wood</b> Badge.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} Cub Scout Trainer <b>Wood</b> Badge was {{field tested}} in 1976. In 1978 the National Council decided in a half-step backwards that <b>Wood</b> Badge needed to place {{greater emphasis on}} the practical aspects of good troop operation along {{with a variety of}} leadership exercises. <b>Wood</b> Badge was adopted as the official advanced training program for adult Cub Scout Leaders.

5|$|Cheddar <b>Wood</b> and {{the smaller}} Macall's <b>Wood</b> form a {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest from {{what remains of the}} <b>wood</b> of the Bishops of Bath and Wells in the 13thcentury and of King Edmund the Magnificent's <b>wood</b> in the 10th. During the 19thcentury, its lower fringes were grubbed out to make strawberry fields. Most of these have been allowed to revert to woodland. The <b>wood</b> was coppiced until 1917. This site compromises a wide range of habitats which include ancient and secondary semi-natural broadleaved woodland, unimproved neutral grassland, and a complex mosaic of calcareous grassland and acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath. Cheddar <b>Wood</b> is one of only a few English stations for starved wood-sedge (Carex depauperata). Purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum), a nationally rare plant, also grows in the <b>wood.</b> Butterflies include silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia), dark green fritillary (Argynnis aglaja), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), holly blue (Celastrina argiolus) and brown argus (Aricia agestis). The slug Arion fasciatus, which has a restricted distribution in the south of England, and the soldier beetle Cantharis fusca also occur.|$|E
5|$|For proper {{protection}} of the <b>wood</b> turtle,in-depth land surveys of its habitat to establish population numbers are needed. One emerging solution to the highway mortality problem, which primarily affects nesting females, is the construction of under-road channels. These tunnels allow the <b>wood</b> turtle to pass under the road, a solution that helps prevent accidental deaths. Brochures and other media that warn people to avoid keeping the <b>wood</b> turtle as a pet are currently being distributed. Next, leaving nests undisturbed, especially common nesting sites and populations, is the best solution to enable the <b>wood</b> turtle's survival.|$|E
5|$|Formerly in {{the genus}} Clemmys, the <b>wood</b> turtle {{is now a}} member of the genus Glyptemys, a {{classification}} that the <b>wood</b> turtle shares with only the bog turtle.

The <b>wood</b> turtle has undergone extensive scientific name changes by various scientists over the course of its history. Today, there are several prominent common names for the <b>wood</b> turtle, including sculptured tortoise, red-legged tortoise, and redleg.|$|E

5|$|Generally, in {{cabinets}} or {{display cases}} that are entirely or partially made of <b>wood,</b> the hydrolysis of acetyl groups in the <b>wood</b> hemicelluloses creates acetic acid. The {{rate at which the}} acetic acid is produced is proportional to the concentration of esters in the <b>wood,</b> the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment. Acidic fumes can also be released from formaldehyde which can occur in <b>wood</b> as a degradation product of lignin. Acidic fumes can also be given off from ubiquitous formaldehyde resins (commonly urea-formaldehyde resins).|$|E
