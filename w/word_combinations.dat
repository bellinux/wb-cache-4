5|$|Vocabulary {{development}} is a process by which people acquire words. Babbling shifts towards meaningful speech as infants grow and produce their first words around the age of one year. In early word learning, infants build their vocabulary slowly. By the age of 18 months, infants can typically produce about 50 words and begin to make <b>word</b> <b>combinations.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Language Comprehension Department, {{headed by}} Anne Cutler, {{undertakes}} empirical investigation and computational modeling of {{the understanding of}} spoken language. Until 2009, the work within the department was largely divided between two research projects: decoding continuous speech and phonological learning for speech perception. From 2009 onwards, {{most of the work}} of the department goes into the project called Mechanisms and Representations in Comprehending Speech. This project focuses on core theoretical issues in speech comprehension such as on how episodic memories - such as hearing someone speak in an unfamiliar dialect - influence the speech perception system, or how is prior knowledge about one's language (phonotactic probabilities, lexical knowledge, frequent versus infrequent <b>word</b> <b>combinations)</b> used during perception.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} {{potentially}} offensive words and <b>word</b> <b>combinations</b> were automatically censored in messages that were typed in any chat channel, be it public, private, group, or club chat. Users {{were able to}} report inappropriate or offensive behavior of other users to moderators by accessing the PlayStation Home Safe Screen. Moderators reviewed these reports periodically, and took action against a user's account based on the type and severity of the offense. A limited number of live moderators also patrolled PlayStation Home, who {{had the ability to}} take action against users immediately. These moderators were often invisible to other users, and typically would not type in public chat. Suspensions and bans were made against a user's PSN account, and restricted their ability not only to use PlayStation Home, but any other online service on PSN. Users were also able to change their communication settings to block or mute messages from users who were not on their friends list.|$|E
