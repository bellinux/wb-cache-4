500|$|Mother Gothel is {{voiced by}} American actress and singer Donna Murphy, a Tony Award-winning Broadway actress who was {{informed}} about the casting call for Tangled by her agent. Having never voiced an animated character before, the actress decided to audition {{for the role of}} the film's villain based solely on the expectation that the unfamiliar experience would be [...] "fun". Almost immediately, Murphy developed a strong liking towards Gothel because of the character's complexity. Known for her award-winning Broadway performances, Murphy prepared herself for her Tangled audition similar {{to the way in which}} the actress would have prepared for a Broadway audition. Refusing to rely solely on her voice, Murphy also provided Gothel with an additional background that [...] "flush out the moments beyond <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> the film." [...] Although Greno and Howard had already held Murphy in high regard as [...] "a spectacular singer", the actress was required to audition a song for the directors nonetheless, performing [...] "Children Will Listen" [...] from the musical Into the Woods. Howard revealed in an interview that Murphy was ultimately chosen out of hundreds of actresses because she possessed [...] "something extra"; the directors especially enjoyed the charisma and intelligence Murphy brought to the role.|$|E

2500|$|Partial {{convective}} overturn is {{a mechanism}} by which the geology {{and structure of the}} Pilbara Craton can be explained. This mechanism involves cold, dense material sinking into hot, less dense material as it rises in dome/pillar-like formations. This results in steeply dipping anticline-syncline complex, in which the greenstone {{at the bottom of the}} syncline experiences the most deformation. As seen in the figure, this process can be described in a simplified version, through 2 stages. In stage 1, heat being radiated from the partially melted granite rising is insulated by the cold greenstone cover, and as a result, the greenstone at the bottom of the formation begins to [...] "drip" [...] down, making room for the granitic to rise further. In stage 2, the small, sporadic greenstone drips and granitic pillars have consolidated into fewer, larger domes and keels as they continue to rise. The end result is a structural geology similar to <b>what</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> Pilbara. This process is also known as vertical tectonics.|$|E

2500|$|Landscape studies {{draw upon}} {{a variety of}} topographical, archaeological and written sources. There are major {{problems}} in trying to relate Anglo-Saxon charter boundaries to those of Roman estates for {{which there are no}} written records, {{and by the end of}} the Anglo-Saxon period there had been major changes to the organisation of the landscape which can obscure earlier arrangements. Interpretation is also hindered by uncertainty about late Roman administrative arrangements. Nevertheless, studies carried out throughout the country, in [...] "British" [...] as well as [...] "Anglo-Saxon" [...] areas, have found examples of continuity of territorial boundaries where, for instance, Roman villa estate boundaries seem to have been identical with those of medieval estates, as delineated in early charters, though settlement sites within the defined territory might shift. <b>What</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>in</b> these examples is probably continuity of the estate or territory as a unit of administration rather than one of exploitation. Although the upper level of Roman administration based on towns seems to have disappeared during the 5th century, a subsidiary system based on subdivisions of the countryside may have continued.|$|E

Taking the Mexican War as a specimen, this peculiar composition of an American army, as well in respect to its officers as its private soldiers, seems to create a spirit of romantic adventure which more than supplies the place of disciplined courage.|$|E
