5|$|In 1926 he left Cambridge for the University of Göttingen {{to study}} under Max Born. Göttingen {{was one of}} the world's leading centers for {{theoretical}} physics. Oppenheimer made friends who went on to great success, including Werner Heisenberg, Pascual Jordan, Wolfgang Pauli, Paul Dirac, Enrico Fermi and Edward Teller. He was known for being too enthusiastic in discussion, sometimes to the point of taking over seminar sessions. This irritated some of Born's other students so much that Maria Goeppert presented Born with a petition signed by herself and others threatening a boycott of the class unless he made Oppenheimer quiet down. Born left it out on his desk where Oppenheimer could read it, and it was effective <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> being said.|$|E

25|$|An {{extension}} of Novardok's unconventional approach entailed {{the establishment of}} numerous branches of the yeshiva. The most elite students of the yeshiva would set out on foot to strange communities without money in their pockets, simultaneously abstaining from speech and not asking for a ride or even food. Upon reaching a town, they would enter the Beth Midrash, and <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> to anyone, study Torah.|$|E
25|$|It {{was held}} by a single Intelligence and Reconnaissance platoon of the 394th Infantry Regiment, who were dug into a ridge {{near the village of}} about 15 homes. They were {{initially}} supported by Task Force X, made up of 2nd Platoon, Company A, 820th Tank Destroyer Battalion and 22 men of the 820th's 2nd Recon Platoon, commanded by Lieutenant John Arculeer, who were mounted on an armored half-track and two jeeps. But shortly after the early morning German bombardment ended, Task Force X pulled out <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> and headed south. That left the 18 men of the reconnaissance platoon alone, along with four forward artillery observers, to fill in the gap.|$|E

25|$|Head faced his {{debilitating}} illness with a {{great degree}} of heroism. As Dr.George Riddoch wrote:When his final work on aphasia was finished we discussed the situation together. With his practical philosophy he accepted it at once, and his amazing power of adaptation enabled him to plan the rearrangement of his life. With his excellent general health he well knew {{what he had to}} face — long years of steadily increasing physical disablement, with his mind unimpaired except in its capacity for continuous effort; {{in the grip of a}} relentless foe which medical science could not restrain. <b>Without</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> of self-pity, with distress only for his devoted wife's heavy burden, he set himself in his methodical way to make his plans, and nothing was omitted. It was as if he was dealing with one of his own patients. His attitude of mind, as always, was constructive and never defeatist. Essentially an individualist, whilst dependent upon friends and kindred spirits, he succeeded in keeping alive his wide interests and, through the attraction of his personality, the contacts which were necessary to him. Science, literature, music, human affairs, all retained their accustomed importance, although in a increasingly restricted sense as the enemy, whom he could not conquer, but who never defeated his active mind, encircled him ever more tightly. Each outpost lost led to new adjustments, every cold or minor ailment added to the rate of downward progress without hope of improvement. But his courage, tenacity and constructiveness remained unimpaired.|$|E

500|$|There {{are several}} {{conflicting}} versions {{of what happened}} on the field in the Middlesex game. On the morning of 19 August, replying to suggestions that he was drunk, Peel spoke to a newspaper reporter and stated: [...] "Before I went on the ground at Sheffield—I don't blush to say it—I had two small glasses of gin and water. At luncheon time I had nothing". Peel said that he opened the bowling with Stanley Jackson and was eventually rested <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> being said to him. He stated that he later slipped twice while fielding, but the cause was that the spikes on his boots were broken. That evening, when he went to collect his wages {{at the end of the}} game, the Yorkshire secretary, Joseph Wolstenholme, informed him of the suspension on the grounds that his play was [...] "unsatisfactory", and when pressed by Peel for an explanation, he told him: [...] "You have had a glass too much".|$|E

500|$|Following the {{dissolution}} of Carmella's relationship with Oliver, Blair commented that Oliver would [...] "always have {{a special place in}} Carmella's heart". Although Carmella began dating Marco, Blair felt that Chloe's premature birth strengthened the connection between Carmella and Oliver. She explained that Carmella [...] "feels desolate and suddenly the connection Carmella's always had with Oliver is heightened. Together they name their baby Chloe and it's Marco who feels shut out." [...] Following Chloe's birth, Carmella decided to put her love life to one side, and put her baby daughter first. She told Marco she did not want him in her life; he planned to leave town <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> to her, except a love note and a present to Chloe. Discussing the state of her relationship with Oliver and Marco at this point, Blair assessed: [...] "I don't think it's so much of a love triangle anymore. Oliver made his feelings for Carmella very clear - he doesn't love her in that way. But he still doesn't want another man looking after his child. So there'll be more tension between the [...] of them. And things get even more complicated over the next few months." ...|$|E
500|$|Ruth K. MacDonald of New Mexico State University at {{the time}} of her Beatrix Potter (1986) argues that the theme of The Pie is the very proper social {{relations}} between neighbours in a small town. She points to the overly formal quality of the letters exchanged between the heroines as one example of the theme, and another, she indicates, is the manner in which the two pass each other on the street <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> to one another because [...] "they were going to have a party". Though Duchess probably does not speak to Ribby for fear of revealing her plan to switch the two pies, Ribby probably does not speak to Duchess out of an exaggerated sense of politeness or because she is rushed. [...] At the hour of the party, Duchess is anxious to arrive on time, yet not too early, and loiters outside Ribby's cottage before delivering her most [...] "genteel little tap-tappity" [...] and asking [...] "Is Mrs. Ribston at home?" [...] MacDonald notes that these instances not only underscore the elaborate codes of behaviour Potter's fictional animals observe but, by extension, the villagers of Sawrey. [...] For Potter, the result of such elaborate etiquette was nonsensical, distorted behaviour. Nevertheless, the cat and dog remain friends at the end of the story, and, in carefully avoiding any offence, their social pretenses and codes of etiquette are maintained.|$|E
500|$|Smith met Kissinger in Pretoria on 18 September 1976 {{to discuss}} the terms. The American diplomat told the prime {{minister}} that although he was obliged to take part, his participation in what he termed the [...] "demise of Rhodesia" [...] was [...] "one of the great tragedies of my life". All the same, he encouraged Smith strongly to accept the deal he placed on the table, though {{he knew it was}} unpalatable, as any future offer could only be worse. Western opinion was already [...] "soft and decadent", Kissinger warned, and would become even more so if, as projected, American President Gerald Ford lost that year's presidential election to Jimmy Carter. A session including Kissinger, Smith and Vorster then began, and here Smith relayed his concern that his acceptance could be perceived by the Rhodesian electorate as [...] "selling out" [...] and could cause a mass exodus of skilled workers and investment, which would in turn severely damage the country's economy. Vorster requested a break in the session and took Smith's team into a private side-room, accompanied by South African Foreign Minister Hilgard Muller. There he privately informed Smith that it was no longer viable for South Africa to support Rhodesia financially and militarily, and that Smith should make up his mind quickly and announce his acceptance that evening. This ultimatum deeply shocked the Rhodesian team; two of Smith's ministers, Desmond Lardner-Burke and Jack Mussett, were unable to contain their anger and vociferously berated the South African prime minister for his [...] "irresponsibility", leading Vorster to rise from his seat <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> and leave the room.|$|E

This group was not particularly happy with the term [...] "transvestism", and therefore took on the term [...] "cross-dresser". Cross-dressers are men who wear female clothing and often both admire and imitate women, but self-identify as different from both gay men and transsexuals, and generally deny having fetishistic intentions.|$|E

Gaston is uncomfortable with her knowledge of the other courtesans, and concerned for Gigi because of the unrelenting attention and judgment of other patrons. Honoré then delivers a crushing blow when he congratulates Gaston on his new courtesan and makes degrading remarks towards Gigi. Gaston, too in love with Gigi to give her this appalling life of uncertainty and judgment, leaves <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> after dragging her home crying. However, he stops a little way {{down the street and}} realizes his love for her is too strong, so he does something he never thought he would do and he proposes marriage.|$|E

2500|$|The {{staging of}} the play [...] "Unschuld" [...] (Innocence) at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin was also subject of protest. The activist group [...] "Bühnenwatch" [...] (stage watch) {{performed}} a stunt {{in one of the}} stagings: 42 activists, posing as spectators, left the audience <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> and later distributed leaflets to the audience. Fundamental of the criticism was that the use of black-face solidifies stereotypes regardless of any good intentions and supports racist structures. The critics were invited to a discussion with the director, actors, theatre manager and other artists of the Deutsches Theater. As a result of the discussion, Deutsches Theater changed the design of actor make-up. Ulrich Khuon, the theatre manager, later admitted to being surprised by the protest and is now in a process of reflection.|$|E
2500|$|In Copenhagen, Captain Meyer's arrival was {{naturally}} awaited with a {{good deal}} of interest, even anxiety. [...] The captain's report when he arrived on June 10, 1685, without Adolph Esmit, and even <b>without</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> from Milan, gave the directors and shareholders food for thought. Although they had only the captain's unsupported word, the small cargo and Milan's silence could not but rouse their fears that something was seriously wrong at St. Thomas. A meeting of the Company's shareholders was held within two days, and it was decided that the situation was serious enough to justify sending a memorial to the king asking once more for the loan of the Fortuna, [...] and for the sending thence of a commissioner with power to settle all the difficulties. They suggested an attorney or fiscal in the navy department, Mikkel Mikkelsen. The king could do nothing but fall in with the company's recommendations.|$|E

He says that such conduct may be all right for the Navy but would not be tolerated by the Marines. The duty officer asks if Meadows had tried to escape, which they deny in order to avoid getting him into more trouble. He also notices that their orders were never officially signed by the master-at-arms in Norfolk, and says that they effectively have not left that station.
