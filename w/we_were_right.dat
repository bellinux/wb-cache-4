500|$|Two {{prints of}} Doppelgänger in its {{original}} 35mm format, for UK release, are known to exist. One is retained by the British Film Institute (BFI), the other by Fanderson, the official fan society dedicated to the Gerry Anderson productions. The original prints of Doppelgänger position Ian Hendry before Roy Thinnes in the opening credits; in the Journey to the Far Side of the Sun format, Thinnes is billed before Hendry. Certain UK prints alter the final scene featuring the old Jason Webb {{with the addition of}} a short voice-over from Thinnes in character as Ross, who is heard speaking a line that he says to Webb earlier in the film: [...] "Jason, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>right.</b> There are definitely two identical planets." ...|$|E
500|$|With a {{production}} budget of , principal photography began in New Orleans, Louisiana, on , 2012. After seven weeks, filming concluded on , 2012. As {{a way to}} keep down production costs, a bulk of the filming took place around the greater New Orleans area– mostly south of the Red River country in the north of the state, where the historic Northup was enslaved. Among locations used were four historic antebellum plantations: Felicity, Bocage, Destrehan, and Magnolia. Magnolia, a plantation in Schriever, Louisiana, is {{just a few miles from}} one of the historic sites where Northup was held. [...] "To know that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>right</b> there in the place where these things occurred was so powerful and emotional," [...] said actor Chiwetel Ejiofor. [...] "That feeling of dancing with ghosts– it's palpable." [...] Filming also took place at the Columns Hotel and Madame John's Legacy in the French Quarter of New Orleans.|$|E

2500|$|Major's {{verdict on}} the ERM {{was that it}} was the {{medicine}} that cured Britain of inflation; [...] "it hurt but it worked." [...] Speaking a few days after Black Wednesday, the Governor of the Bank of England, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, argued that [...] "the decision to join the ERM two years ago in the circumstances; that, having joined, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>right</b> to endeavour to stick it out; and that, in the circumstances which evolved, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>right</b> to withdraw." [...] Lamont's view expressed in his memoirs was more nuanced: without the discipline of the ERM, the Major government would have given up on the fight against inflation before Black Wednesday; ERM membership delivered a sharp break in Britain's inflation performance; the judgment of the markets that the higher rates needed to maintain Britain's membership was undoubtedly correct; [...] "the ERM was a tool that broke in my hands when it had accomplished all that it could usefully do." [...] Sir Alan Budd, the Treasury's Chief Economic Adviser during the period and later appointed by Gordon Brown to the Monetary Policy Committee, in an economic assessment of Britain's membership of the ERM, has written, [...] "although it was certainly a political disaster, the case can be made that it was an economic triumph and marked the turning point in our macro-economic performance." ...|$|E
2500|$|We {{could have}} done it if we'd kept punching, but the band {{actually}} disintegrated, basically, looking back, because we were too tired. We should have just taken a year off. But what happened was <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>right</b> {{at the end of the}} period when, in order to flog a record in the States, you were virtually out promoting the one you had out the year before. So it was a totally asynchronous situation. We were having to dig into what we viewed as archives when we went out of the country. So we were having to promote Screaming Targets when we already had Hats Off Step Lively out here. It was at a time of the most intense development of original material in the band's life so the result was extremely disruptive. – Camilleri ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Preliminary Final against Sydney FC, the Phoenix lost 4–2 in {{controversial}} circumstances. After {{being locked}} at 1–1 through goals from Chris Payne for Sydney and Andrew Durante for Wellington, Payne apparently missed a header and deflected {{the ball into}} the goal off his hand. Andrew Durante, who was marking Payne went straight over to the linesman, but the goal stood. [...] "I went straight to the linesman. I knew 100 per cent it was handball. I spoke to the ref at halftime about it and he said it wasn't deliberate. It's pretty funny that one. Such a big game and such a big occasion, for something like that to change the game is very disappointing." [...] Sydney FC strikers Alex Brosque and Mark Bridge both scored break-away goals as Phoenix pushed forward. Eugene Dadi then added a late consolation goal. Phoenix striker Chris Greenacre said that it changed the dynamics of the game. [...] "It just rips the heart out of you. We got back in the game with a good goal and that takes it away from you. It wasn't to be. I think <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>right</b> back in it. They played some good football but I thought we had withstood it OK. If we went into halftime [...] we were really confident we could get something out of it." [...] Coach Ricki Herbert echoed those statements. The loss brought the end to the Phoenix's season, meaning that Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC would compete in the Grand Final.|$|E
