5000|$|In both Southern and Northern Italy, {{large numbers}} of migrant workers from Africa and Asia produce {{agricultural}} goods within a context of severe social and environmental marginalization, lacking access to clean water, utilities, housing, and <b>wage</b> <b>security</b> while facing exposure to harsh working conditions and harmful pesticides. As of 2015, the Italian Association for Legal Studies on Immigration (ASGI) estimated that there were likely close to 500,000 regular and irregular foreign agricultural workers in Italy, of whom 100,000 {{were believed to be}} at risk of severe marginalization in regards to living conditions and social mobility. [...] According to a report by Amnesty International, there is [...] "a causal link between labour exploitation of migrant workers and the measures adopted by the Italian government with the stated view of controlling and regulating migration flows". The report focused on the Latina and the Caserta areas where {{large numbers of}} workers are of Indian (mostly Punjabi) and African origin respectively, the latter of whom are mostly from Burkina Faso, Ghana, Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, and Tunisia. In Calabria, immigrant fruit pickers for the orange juice industry have been identified as subject to notably exploitative social conditions.While some migrant agricultural workers are paid well and welcomed as economic contributors for helping fill jobs that established Italians are often reluctant to perform, the average wage in Italy for migrant agricultural workers is only 33 dollars a day. In the Latina area alone, 61% of agricultural employers were found by Italian regulatory inspectors to be in contravention of social security and employment laws. In Caserta, migrant agricultural workers partake in the tomato, fruit, dairy, watermelon, and orange industries, often under exploitative or substandard employment conditions. In particular, the fast-growing and lucrative Italian tomato industry, which sources 60 percent of processed tomatoes consumed in the UK and half the entire European Union supply, has been identified as a significant source of workplace abuse even though it produced a total export value of 1.5 billion Euros in 2014. While 70% of Italy's tomato production is generated from the areas of Puglia and Emilia Romagna, severe abuses of tomato pickers have been documented throughout Italy, including most provinces.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that Yugoslav firms have also been {{subjected}} to massive, pervasive redistribution through a soft budget constraint. To quantify such redistribution, the authors focus particulary on the redistributive effects of holding financial assets and liabilities in an inflationary environment in which financial claims are generally not indexed. Analyzing firm-level data for Yugoslavia's manufacturing sector for 1986, they show that such flows, in contrast to those of other Eastern European economies, have been a far more important source of redistribution than taxes and subsidies. Although Yugoslavia's channels of redistribution differ significantly from those in other socialist economies, they share a common driving force: the pursuit of job and <b>wage</b> <b>security.</b> Producers of energy, food, and heavy manufactures, as well as less developed regions, have particulary benefited from the redistribution.

Thus expansion of employment has not been as distress a phenomenon as often apprehended. There is a shift of middle wage level jobs from regular to casual employment, leading to declining inequality among casual workers and increased inequality among regulars. However, availability of mandays is decreasing, especially among casual workers. Perhaps jobs are continuously and decisively getting transformed from regular to casual employment and then being outsourced to the self-employeds. Increasing disparity between workers of High and Low Income States, and between White collar and Blue Collar occupations are concerns that need to be addressed. Creating more mandays of work and facilitating capacity building through education and skill formation should be the policy focus. ...|$|E

The present paper analyses the wage-employment scenario in India in the post-reform period with special emphasis on the regional dimension.

There is a shift of middle wage level jobs from regular to casual employment, leading to declining inequality among casual workers and increased inequality among regulars. However, availability of mandays is decreasing, especially among casual workers. At the regional level, employment opportunities are getting narrowed down in the high income states but those who are employed are getting better remuneration. On the other hand, in the low income states, number of wage workers is rising but earning per worker is going down. Increasing disparity between workers of High and Low Income States, and between Regular & Casual workers are concerns that need to be addressed. Creating more mandays of work in the high income states and facilitating capacity building through education and skill formation in the low income states should be the policy focus. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{heated debate}} {{about how to}} reform Social Security {{has come to a}} {{standstill}} because the view of most Democrats (that Social Security must be a defined benefits plan similar in spirit to the current system) seems irreconcilable with the proposals supported by many Republicans (to create a defined contribution system of personal accounts holding marketed assets). We describe a system of "progressive personal accounts" that preserves the core goals of both parties, and that is self-balancing on an ongoing basis. Progressive personal accounts have two critical features: (1) accruals into the personal accounts would be exclusively in a new kind of derivative security (which we call a PAAW for Personal Annuitized Average <b>Wage</b> <b>security)</b> that pays its owner one inflation-corrected dollar during every year of life after his statutory retirement date, multiplied by the economy wide average wage at the retirement date and (2) households would buy their new PAAWs each year with their social security contributions, augmented or reduced by a government match that would add to contributions from households with low lifetime incomes by taking from households with high lifetime incomes. PAAWS define benefits and achieve risk sharing across generations, as Democrats would like, yet can be held in personal accounts with market valuations, as Republicans propose. ...|$|E

An aggregate analysis of the US shows that {{over a quarter of}} industries and occupations in the liberal postfordist employment structure are low-wage. I construct an analytical framework based on four general types of labor process: high-skill autonomous work, semi-autonomous, tightly-constrained and unrationalized labor intensive work. These are expanded into eighteen distinct work systems by elaborating them in terms of various configurations along four elements of job quality: <b>wages,</b> <b>security,</b> training and promotion opportunities, and work intensity. While the typology can be reduced to three job types (good jobs, bad jobs and humdrum-but-decent jobs), the expanded typology is useful for the qualitative analysis of the institution dynamics of competition within which any particular organization operates. I present two case studies of the downgrading of labor processes along the expanded typology in manufacturing and retail sales...|$|R
40|$|Cet article vise à appréhender la réalité québécoise en matière d'évolution des modes de rémunération et des {{structures}} de salaire négociés par les syndicats et les employeurs en mettant en évidence les changements qui se sont produits dans les conventions collectives depuis 1980. This {{article examines}} the evolution of compensation and wage structures in unionized Quebec workplaces. Drawing on a study of 200 collective agreements, the article investigates changes to wage and compensation clauses since 1980. Assuming that employers in unionized settings {{are looking for ways}} of increasing financial and functional flexibility, the author puts forward three hypotheses : 1 - Financial (pay) flexibility induces union-management bargaining over compensation Systems. Compensation moves away from seniority-based determination and towards individualized pattems based on organizational performance. 2 - Financial flexibility also accelerates bargaining over wage determination and progression structures, the costs of which are spread over longer periods of time than previously. 3 - Functional flexibility promotes negotiation and review of wage structures with a decline in salary grades and in employment levels. The author concludes that financial flexibility has not led to bargaining over compensation Systems. To the contrary, wage structures are remarkably stable and only rarely are individual financial incentives agreed upon and made part of collective agreements. Moreover, wages remain tied to specifie job contents rather than to individual abilities, performance and know-how. Collective bargaining over wages in Quebec thus remains within the scientific management model and has not moved towards a humanistic vision of work, still less towards strategie compensation. Many factors explain these conclusions. On the one hand, the research hypothesis rests on the postulate that employers are pursuing organizational flexibility as a means to remain competitive. This may, however, not be the case for unionized segments of the workforce. Consequently, we would not find financial flexibility structures in collective agreements. On the other hand, Quebec unions have strategies in this regard which may prevent the growth of flexibility clauses in collective agreements. The two major labour organizations in the province, the CSN and the FTQ, have clear policies over workplace flexibility. Both favour wage structures tied to job definition and content rather than to the attributes of individual workers. Such a strategy is consistent with rules designed for tightly defined jobs supported by the seniority principle for progression in wage scales. In short, union strategy remains wedded the goal of <b>wage</b> <b>security</b> and Quebec unions appear more willing to accept a decline in real wages than to support changes to the structure of wage determination. These findings suggest a tendency for unions and management to change wage scales {{in such a way that}} the cost of compensation is spread over a longer period of time than previously. Employers' obvious rationale is to lower labour costs in the short and in the long term. In those workplaces where wage and compensation structures have been the object of review by the parties, these do not seem to be part of a process of increasing functional flexibility. Job enlargement and multiskilling are not part of the redesign of salary structures. The author finds little evidence of change in the number of occupational and job classifications. Rules setting boundaries between tasks and barriers between trades remain dominant features of Quebec collective agreements. The author points out two limitations of this study. First, the analysis is restricted to those collective agreements registered with the Bureau du Commissaire general du travall and thus excludes flexible arrangements made by the parties outside the realm of collective bargaining (functional, gain-sharing, profit-sharing, so on). Second, the sample of agreements excludes workplaces for which no collective agreement existed in 1980. First collective agreements concluded in the last 3 or 6 years may include such financial and functional flexibility provisions. A study of these union management agreements could best measure if age-history of collective relationships is a significant determinant of changes in work rules towards more flexibility...|$|E
