5|$|First in his class, Houphouët was {{accepted}} into the École William Ponty in 1919, and earned a teaching degree. In 1921, he attended the École de médecine de l'AOF (French West Africa School of Medicine) in French Senegal, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> first in his class in 1925 and qualified as a medical assistant. As he never completed his studies in medicine, he could qualify only as a médecin africain, a poorly paid doctor.|$|E
5|$|If Stellenbosch marked Smuts's {{intellectual}} awakening, it {{also was}} <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to mature socially. Here he began to cast off the shyness and reserve which afflicted him, joining the local militia, becoming {{a regular contributor to}} the college magazine, and becoming leader of the Victoria College debating society. For the first time, in both verbal and literary debate, Smuts began to grapple with the political and social issues facing South Africa.|$|E

5|$|Josh Walker {{was born}} on 21 February 1989 in Newcastle upon Tyne and {{graduated}} from Middlesbrough's youth academy. Having been part of Middlesbrough's FA Youth Cup winning team of 2003–04, Walker made his team debut, scoring the final goal in a 4–2 friendly victory over Carlisle United in July 2005. His league debut came on the last game of the 2005–06 season, when Middlesbrough fielded a team largely filled with academy graduates in a 1–0 defeat to Fulham, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> as a 62nd-minute substitute for Malcolm Christie.|$|E
5|$|Robben, {{recovering}} from his injury {{was chosen for}} a friendly against SV Lippstadt 08. He scored a goal, shortly before being substituted because of another injury in the 36th minute. Robben's six-week injury caused him to miss several matches. He returned to training and remained on the bench until 21 September Bundesliga match against Hertha BSC, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> on instead of Thomas Müller and scored in the 3–0 victory. Robben remained on the bench for the other Bayern fixtures, including Bayern's 1–0 loss to Atlético Madrid in the Champions League.|$|E
5|$|Americus raced as {{a three-year-old}} in America, winning {{a number of}} races. In May 1895, he raced at Louisville under the {{ownership}} of the Santa Anita Stable, winning a race on May 14 {{at a distance of}} 5/8 of a mile. On May 20, he finished second in the Schulte Stakes. By June, he was at Coney Island, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> in second in a sweepstakes race on June 15. On June 18, he lost a sweepstakes to Domino, finishing third. On July 4, he won a sweepstakes at a distance of 3/4 of a mile. As a three-year-old, Americus also won the Culver Stakes.|$|E

5|$|Byzantines availed {{themselves}} {{of a number}} of diplomatic practices. For example, embassies to the capital would often stay on for years. A member of other royal houses would routinely be requested to stay on in Constantinople, not only as a potential hostage, but also as a useful pawn in case political conditions <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> from changed. Another key practice was to overwhelm visitors by sumptuous displays. According to Dimitri Obolensky, the preservation of the ancient civilisation in Europe was due to the skill and resourcefulness of Byzantine diplomacy, which remains one of Byzantium's lasting contributions to the history of Europe.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell's time at King's was {{probably}} the most productive of his career. He was awarded the Royal Society's Rumford Medal in 1860 for his work on colour and was later elected to the Society in 1861. This period of his life would see him display the world's first light-fast colour photograph, further develop his ideas on the viscosity of gases, and propose a system of defining physical quantities—now known as dimensional analysis. Maxwell would often attend lectures at the Royal Institution, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> into regular contact with Michael Faraday. The relationship between the two men could not be described as being close, because Faraday was 40years Maxwell's senior and showed signs of senility. They nevertheless maintained a strong respect for each other's talents.|$|E

With the {{exception}} of the Nevada caucuses January 19, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> in 2nd (14%) behind Romney (51%), he did little better through the rest of January: Michigan 4th (6%), South Carolina 5th (4%), Florida 5th (3%). On SuperTuesday, February 5, he placed 4th in almost every state, generally taking in a mere 3–6% of the votes although he did better in the northern states of North Dakota (21%, 3rd place) and Montana (25%, 2nd place).|$|E

5|$|At the Heineken Open in Auckland, New Zealand, del Potro {{was the top}} seed. He {{defeated}} American Sam Querrey in {{the final}} to win the title, the fifth of his career. Seeded eighth at the Australian Open, he beat Marin Čilić in the fourth round. Del Potro's tournament ended in his next match, when he lost in straight sets to Federer. At the BNP Paribas Open, the sixth seed del Potro advanced to the quarterfinals, where he was defeated by world No. 1 Nadal. Del Potro avenged that loss the following week at the Sony Ericsson Open, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> back from a double break down in the third set at 0–3 to defeat Nadal in the quarterfinals. This {{was the first time}} del Potro had defeated Nadal in five meetings. Despite a loss in the semifinals to Murray, del Potro reached a career-high world ranking of No. 5.|$|E
5|$|Meyszner {{remained}} {{stationed at}} Judenburg {{for the next}} nine years, although he was sent on several detachments. In 1921, {{he was promoted to}} Major der Polizei (Major of Police). While commanding a gendarmerie detachment sent to oversee the unification of Burgenland with Austria in August 1921, Meyszner was shot in the leg by local Hungarians rebelling against the transfer. In 1922, his unit subdued significant labour unrest in the Judenburg region and in 1927 it quelled a strike {{in the aftermath of the}} July Revolt of 1927. Meyszner joined the Austrian Nazi Party on 5 September 1925, and was allocated membership number 10,617. In May 1927 he was granted an audience with Adolf Hitler, along with two of his Home Guard comrades, Walter Pfrimer and Hanns Albin Rauter. On 1 January 1929, Meyszner was transferred to Graz <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> into contact with more right-wing organisations.|$|E
5|$|Military service {{also allowed}} Ramsey to play {{football}} more regularly, and at a higher standard than before. In late 1940 he was posted to St Austell, on the south coast of Cornwall, where he manned beach defences and became captain of the battalion football team, playing at centre-half or centre-forward as circumstances dictated. After three years in various seaside postings, Ramsey was, in 1943, moved to Barton Stacey in Hampshire, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> {{under the command of}} a Colonel Fletcher, himself an accomplished footballer. Ramsey's battalion team by this time featured players from a number of Football League clubs, including the Brentford forward Len Townsend and Arsenal's Cyril Hodges. Ramsey played at centre-half for his battalion team as Southampton defeated them 10–3 at the Dell in a pre-season friendly on 21 August 1943, and a week later played again as the battalion took on Southampton's reserve team. The soldiers won the second match 4–1.|$|E

5|$|Paja Jovanović (1859–1957) {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} Serbian realist painters of the late 19th century. During his early career, he came to be identified with Orientalist painting, depicting scenes from the Balkans, which were then under the control of the Ottoman Empire. Between 1877 and 1882, he attended the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> under the mentorship of painting instructors Christian Griepenkerl and Leopold Müller. Griepenkerl taught the young Jovanović the underlying structural principles of Renaissance and Baroque art, thus helping him better understand spatial problems and the arrangement of large numbers of figures, both moving and static. Müller encouraged Jovanović to take a naturalist approach to painting, recording only what he could see and relying as little as possible on his imagination. It was in this context that Müller instructed Jovanović to make direct studies of Balkan life during his visits home, purposely steering him towards Orientalist painting.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes {{started his}} career with Eastern Counties League Premier Division side Newmarket Town, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> to {{prominence}} after scoring hat-tricks in three successive games in 2003. Rhodes scored 20 goals {{in the early part}} of the 2003/04 season, including 14 goals in 11 games in the league. After trials with several Football League clubs, he joined Brentford in November 2003 and scored the goal that ensured they were not relegated six months later. Rhodes scored five goals during his four seasons at Brentford, which were hampered by injury and included loan spells at Swindon Town and Grays Athletic. He signed for Bradford City in August 2007 but was released after one season, before joining Rotherham United. A loan spell at Woking was followed by his release from Rotherham in May 2009, when he dropped back out of the Football League to join Oxford United. He played just four games before leaving Oxford by mutual consent, and moved to Braintree Town, initially on a short-term deal. Rhodes rejoined Grays Athletic in January 2010, but was released at the end of the 2009–10 season.|$|E
5|$|The same year, {{the family}} moved to Deurne, a suburb of Antwerp, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> in contact with nature and with scouting, which both had a {{profound}} impact on his character and his later work. With the scouts, he became the troop reporter, writing down heavily illustrated reports on their outings and adventures, in a similar vein as what Hergé did in his scouting period. Through the scouts, he also came into contact with Le Boy-Scout Belge, the Walloon scouting magazine where Hergé made Totor, his first published comic. Vandersteen made a few sequels to these adventures for his friends as amusement, which are the earliest preserved comics he made. He continued to follow the work of Hergé later on. Meanwhile, Vandersteen combined his studies at the Academy with his work in his father's workshop until 1935, when the market for stone decorations for houses collapsed.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, Brooks dead-heated with Stockwell in the 100m {{freestyle}} at the Australian Championships, clocking {{a time of}} 51.12s. He then {{combined with}} Tom Stachewicz, Paul Lee and Barry Armstrong, as Western Australia won the 4100m freestyle relay for the first time. Brooks maintained his form and despite not defending his Australian 100m title, was selected for the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> second to Fasala in the 100m freestyle {{in a time of}} 51.01s. He claimed gold in the 4100m freestyle relay along with Fasala, Stockwell and Matthew Renshaw, anchoring the quartet in setting a Commonwealth Games record. On the return flight, he consumed 46 cans of beer and was banned for six months after he talked about the incident during a television interview. In his memoirs, Talbot, a non-drinker, cited Brooks and his Mean Machine teammates as being one of the biggest proponents of a hard-drinking culture that had permeated the Australian swimming scene at the time. In particular, he singled out Brooks as being a focal point of disruptive activity during his time at the Australian Institute of Sport. Talbot sees alcohol as the main reason behind the collapse of Australia's standing in the swimming world in the 1970s and the subsequent prolonged period of international uncompetitiveness in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In July 2014, Carrick {{suffered}} an injury during a pre-season training session that {{was expected to}} keep him out for 12 weeks. Carrick's first game back from injury came at the 1–0 defeat against Manchester City on 2 November 2014, <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> on as a replacement centre-back following Chris Smalling's dismissal. After Marcos Rojo suffered a dislocated shoulder in the same match, Carrick stated that he would be happy to play as a makeshift centre-back. After Carrick returned to the starting line-up on a regular basis, Match of the Day 2 pundit Dietmar Hamann attributed some of Manchester United's improved form to Carrick's return in December, after the club had won all of the six games that he had started. Sir Alex Ferguson stated that he thought Carrick was the best English player in an interview with BT Sport in December 2014, shortly after Carrick had been named as Manchester United's new vice-captain by Louis van Gaal. On 15 March 2015, he provided an assist for Marouane Fellaini's goal, and scored his first goal {{in more than a year}} during a 3–0 victory against his former club Tottenham Hotspur. On 20 March 2015, Carrick signed a new one-year extension to his contract, lengthening his Manchester United career to 10 seasons.|$|E
5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as he looks up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back <b>where</b> <b>he</b> <b>came</b> from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E
