5|$|Following its capture, the Chetniks {{established}} a command {{post in the}} town and mobilised the populace. Supporters of the Partisans formed a local unit and directed <b>workers</b> <b>into</b> the fields and a nearby mine. The Partisans also set up a workshop in the town to manufacture hand grenades. After their failed attack on Bogatić, the two Chetnik detachments decided to attack Banja Koviljača. Launched on 1 September, this attack was initially unsuccessful. After being reinforced by the Podrinje Partisans, the town was captured {{in the early hours}} of 6 September. In the meantime, other elements of the Podrinje Partisan Detachment had expelled the German garrison and collaborationist gendarmes from Bogatić on 3 September. On 6 October 1941, Loznica was re-occupied during the German Mačva operation.|$|E
5|$|With {{only a small}} local {{population}} during medieval times, {{as a result of}} the introduction of industry, mass migration of village <b>workers</b> <b>into</b> Oldham occurred, resulting in a population change from under 2,000 in 1714 to 12,000 in 1801 to 137,000 in 1901 In 1851 its population of 52,820 made Oldham the 12th most populous town in England. The following is a table outlining the population change of the town since 1801, which demonstrates a trend of rapid population growth in the 19th century and, after peaking at 147,483 people in 1911, a trend of general decline in population size during the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Rajab {{was one of}} {{the founders}} of the first migrant workers {{protection}} committee in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the Migrant Workers Protection Group (in 2003). On 28 April 2007, the Bahraini Parliament passed a law banning unmarried migrant workers from living in residential areas. BCHR issued a press release condemning this decision as discriminatory and promoting negative racist attitudes towards migrant workers. Rajab, then BCHR vice president, said: It is appalling that Bahrain is willing to rest on the benefits of these people’s hard work, and often their suffering, but that they refuse to live with them in equality and dignity. The solution is not to force migrant <b>workers</b> <b>into</b> ghettos, but to urge companies to improve living conditions for workers – and not to accommodate large numbers of workers in inadequate space, and to improve the standard of living for them.|$|E
5|$|Such {{a retreat}} {{was not an}} option in the face of another of Aberhart's troubles. One of Social Credit's 1935 {{promises}} had been the introduction of recall for MLAs, which they had implemented with their first legislative act. As Aberhart's popularity fell, the residents of his own Okotoks-High River riding, where he had been elected in a by-election shortly after the general election (in which he had not run), availed themselves of the legislation. On April9 their petition was endorsed by the riding's Social Credit constituency association, and by fall it had gathered the signatures of the required two thirds of the electorate. In response, the Social Crediters repealed the Recall Act retroactive to its date of origin; Aberhart claimed that oil companies active in his riding had intimidated their <b>workers</b> <b>into</b> signing the petition, and that some of the signatories had moved to the area specifically to sign.|$|E

30|$|There are {{two types}} of worker, type A and type B. Type A workers are favored and account for a {{fraction}} λ of job seekers. Workers search randomly across vacancies offered by employers. Each potential vacancy is associated with a value of the discrimination coefficient c, which is distributed across vacancies over a range from zero to cmax. A vacancy’s discrimination coefficient manifests itself as a tax on the employer who hires a type B <b>worker</b> <b>into</b> the vacancy, but it may influence the wage paid to a type A <b>worker</b> hired <b>into</b> that vacancy.|$|R

2500|$|There {{are several}} types of wordplay used in cryptics. One is {{straightforward}} definition substitution using parts of a word. For example, in one puzzle by Mel Taub, the answer IMPORTANT is given the clue [...] "To bring <b>worker</b> <b>into</b> the country may prove significant". The explanation is that to import means [...] "to bring into the country", the [...] "worker" [...] is a worker ant, and [...] "significant" [...] means important. Here, [...] "significant" [...] is the straight definition (appearing here {{at the end of}} the clue), [...] "to bring <b>worker</b> <b>into</b> the country" [...] is the wordplay definition, and [...] "may prove" [...] serves to link the two. Note that in a cryptic clue, there is almost always only one answer that fits both the definition and the wordplay, so that when one sees the answer, one knows that it is the right answer—although it can sometimes be a challenge to figure out why it is the right answer. A good cryptic clue should provide a fair and exact definition of the answer, while at the same time being deliberately misleading.|$|R
