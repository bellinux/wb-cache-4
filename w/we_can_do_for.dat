Speaking for Google, Brin stated during an interview, [...] "One {{of the reasons}} I am glad we are making this move in China is that the China situation was really emboldening other countries to try and implement their own firewalls." [...] During another interview with Der Spiegel, he added, [...] "For us {{it has always been}} a discussion about how we can best fight for openness on the Internet. We believe that this is the best thing that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> preserving the principles of the openness and freedom of information on the Internet." ...|$|E

He had just adjourned the session {{for the day and}} was preparing to have a drink in House Speaker Sam Rayburn's office when he received an urgent message to go immediately to the White House. Truman assumed President Roosevelt wanted to meet with him, but Eleanor Roosevelt informed him her husband had died after suffering a massive cerebral hemorrhage. Truman's first concern was for Mrs. Roosevelt. He asked if there was anything he could do for her, to which she replied, [...] "Is there anything <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> you? For you are the one in trouble now!" ...|$|E
500|$|Seacole visited Nightingale at the Barrack Hospital in Scutari, {{where she}} asked for a bed for the night, because she {{intended}} to travel to Balaclava {{the next day to}} join her business partner. In her memoirs, she reported that her meeting with Nightingale was friendly, with Nightingale asking [...] "What do you want, Mrs. Seacole? Anything <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> you? If it lies in my power, I shall be very happy." [...] Seacole told her of her [...] "dread of the night journey by caique" [...] and the improbability of being able to find the Hollander in the dark. A bed was then found for her and breakfast sent her in the morning, with a [...] "kind message" [...] from Mrs. Bracebridge, Nightingale's helper. A footnote in the memoir states that Seacole subsequently [...] "saw much of Miss Nightingale at Balaclava," [...] but no further meetings are recorded in the text.|$|E

500|$|To {{supplement}} Hardy's endorsement, Gilbert Walker, {{a former}} mathematical lecturer at Trinity College, Cambridge, looked at Ramanujan's work and expressed amazement, urging {{the young man}} to spend time at Cambridge. As a result of Walker's endorsement, B. Hanumantha Rao, a mathematics professor at an engineering college, invited Ramanujan's colleague Narayana Iyer to {{a meeting of the}} Board of Studies in Mathematics to discuss [...] "what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> S. Ramanujan". The board agreed to grant Ramanujan a research scholarship of 75 rupees per month {{for the next two years}} at the University of Madras. While he was engaged as a research student, Ramanujan continued to submit papers to the Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society. In one instance, Narayana Iyer submitted some of Ramanujan's theorems on summation of series to the journal, adding, [...] "The following theorem is due to S. Ramanujan, the mathematics student of Madras University." [...] Later in November, British Professor Edward B. Ross of Madras Christian College, whom Ramanujan had met a few years before, stormed into his class one day with his eyes glowing, asking his students, [...] "Does Ramanujan know Polish?" [...] The reason was that in one paper, Ramanujan had anticipated the work of a Polish mathematician whose paper had just arrived in the day's mail. In his quarterly papers, Ramanujan drew up theorems to make definite integrals more easily solvable. Working off Giuliano Frullani's 1821 integral theorem, Ramanujan formulated generalisations that could be made to evaluate formerly unyielding integrals.|$|E
500|$|Ritvo {{then moved}} Mucho Macho Man to Santa Anita Park {{almost two months}} before the Breeders' Cup races because she felt he [...] "thrived" [...] in California. It was a major {{commitment}} for the horse's team, as Ritvo, Green, Petro, Tapia and Lopez had to leave their home base in Florida, and Reeves had to cover the expenses. Dean Reeves said, [...] "Everybody has basically put their lives and their family second to the benefit and the best <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> Macho." [...] The horse's next race was the Awesome Again Stakes at Santa Anita on September 28. [...] Because both Smith and Prado had prior riding commitments, Ritvo and Green decided to contact Gary Stevens. Stevens' contribution to the human interest saga included a comeback in 2013 after having been forced to retire seven years earlier due to debilitating knee pain. He also had his own near-death experience, having survived a major riding accident in 2003. [...] In a twist of serendipity, Stevens' agent, Craig O'Brien, came by the barn to inquire about the horse's availability about the same time Ritvo and Green had decided to see if Stevens was available. Stevens later claimed to be unaware of his agent's machinations. Noting that Stevens had portrayed Seabiscuit's jockey George Woolf in the eponymous film, Ritvo later joked, [...] "I was in Hollywood. How could I not use a film star?" [...] In the course of the Awesome Again, Mucho Macho Man settled behind the leaders before making a bid on the final turn. The horse led by three lengths in the homestretch, and accelerated clear of the field to win easily by [...] lengths over Paynter. It was his first win in 2013 and his first Grade I stakes win. [...] The victory was also a [...] "win and you're in" [...] qualifying race for the Breeders' Cup Classic, which included a waiver of the $100,000 entry fee for the Classic.|$|E

This includes spouses, dependent children, parents and parents-in-law. According to one client, Wawa Food Market's director of compensation and benefits, [...] "As an employer there's a limit to what <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>for</b> our employees. For us {{it made sense to}} have this service available, where our associates can reach out to somebody who knows {{the ins and outs of}} the health-care business."

On his return he managed the Derrick Robins XI tour of South Africa, a multiracial cricket team led by Brian Close and including Younis Ahmed, John Shepherd and Gordon Greenidge in an attempt to restore cricket links with South Africa. When they arrived in Cape Town he found that [...] "all the lads I coached twenty years ago are now big businessmen" [...] and he received a warm welcome. He managed another Derek Robins XI under David Lloyd the next year and although the cricket was a success they failed to re-establish international cricket in South Africa and an attempt to integrate cricket in South Africa failed.|$|E
