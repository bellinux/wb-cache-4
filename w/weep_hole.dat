40|$|This paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of a novel ultrasonic inspection technique that detects radial fatigue cracks {{on the far side of}} thin airframe stiffener 'weep ' holes. These cracks are located on the upper part of the <b>weep</b> <b>hole</b> (1 2 o'clock position), away from the lower skin of the wing. Cracks in this position are not readily detectable by conventional ultrasonic inspection techniques, particularly for short cracks. A special technique using circumferential creeping waves was adapted to inspect for these cracks. The conventional creeping wave technique experiences a strong specular reflection from the near surface of the hole that masks the creeping wave signal that arrives later in time. In order to overcome this difficulty, a split-aperture (two-element) transducer was used that resulted in the specular and creeping wave echoes being approximately equal in magnitude. The two separate transducers allowed us to alternate between pulse-echo and pitch-catch modes of operation with a resulting improvement in detection sensitivity. In the case of 0. 25 -inch-diameter weep holes, optimum sensitivity was calculated to be around 5 MHz. The detection threshold was found to be approximately 0. 003 inches and the signal saturated at crack lengths in excess of 0. 020 inches. The original paint and surface finish had no substantial adverse effects on the technique's sensitivity. Similarly, changing the <b>weep</b> <b>hole</b> diameter or chamfer conditions did not significantly affect the technique's performance. These results were obtained using specimens with both machined notches and real fatigue cracks...|$|E
40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper was initiated by recent efforts to use circumferential creeping waves for ultrasonic nondestructive testing of inaccessible airframe structures for fatigue cracking. One particular such application of great interest in the aerospace industry is the inspection of weep holes drilled through vertical stiffeners in wet-wing structures (used as fuel tanks) of both military and civilian aircraft in order to permit remnant fuel to be evenly distributed during flight. Unfortunately, they can become the sites from which fatigue cracks often originate. A new split-aperture technique was recently suggested for the inspection of these holes [1]. The outstanding sensitivity of the split-aperture circumferential creeping wave technique in dry weep holes was well demonstrated on both simulated and real fatigue cracks. However, the presence of fuel or even its residues in the <b>weep</b> <b>hole</b> significantly affects the behavior of the circumferential creeping wave. It causes the creeping wave echo to split into a rather weak Rayleigh-type surface wave signal and a much stronger but somewhat slower halo signal [2]. In order to adapt the circumferential creeping wave inspection technique to the case of fluid-filled cavities {{it is important to understand}} the adverse effects of fluid loading on the Rayleigh- type circumferential surface wave, which is the only mode sensitive to such cracks...|$|E
40|$|Water {{penetration}} {{from beneath}} of built structures on permeable soils causes uplift force along the contact of structure with foundation. This uplift force reduces hydraulic structure stability. Typically, these instabilities occur due to under-pressure development (uplift force), gradual inner degradation of foundation material (piping) or sand boil phenomenon. Thus, it seems necessary {{to calculate the}} pressure applied to the contact surface of the dam. One method for preventing piping phenomenon, reduction in exit gradient as well as decrease of uplift force beneath diversion dams includes implementation of <b>weep</b> <b>hole.</b> This study aims to study the effect of radius, depth and location of pipe drains under stilling basin upon how much uplift force decreases. The benefit of this study in agricultural field for soil and water engineers {{is to have a}} safe design of lined canals, weirs or diversion dams. To do this, numerical simulation of Tabriz diversion dam with Geo-Studio software was carried out. Results showed that application of drain pipe under the structure reduced uplift force respect to without drain under the structure. Increasing of drain radius; caused reduction of uplift pressure more but increased of seepage flow slightly. Installation of drain in upper part of stilling basin had a tendency to decrease uplift pressure more.

50|$|Cavity walls {{consist of}} two 'skins' {{separated}} by a hollow space (cavity). The skins are commonly masonry such as brick or concrete block. Masonry is an absorbent material, and therefore will slowly draw rainwater or even humidity into the wall, {{as well as from}} the inside of the house as from outside. The cavity serves as a way to drain water back out through <b>weep</b> <b>holes</b> at the base of the wall system or above windows. The <b>weep</b> <b>holes</b> allow wind to create an air stream through the cavity and the stream removes evaporated water from the cavity to the outside. Usually <b>weep</b> <b>holes</b> are created by intentionally leaving several vertical joints, also open head joints, open about two meters apart at the base of in every story. <b>Weep</b> <b>holes</b> are also placed above windows to prevent dry rot of a wooden window frame.

40|$|Recently, the {{development}} of a novel ultrasonic inspection technique that detects radial fatigue cracks {{on the far side of}} so-called “weep” holes in thin airframe stiffeners was reported [1]. These cracks tend to be located on the upper part of the <b>weep</b> <b>hole</b> (at 12 o’clock position) therefore are not readily detectable by conventional ultrasonic inspection techniques from the lower skin of the wing. The new technique utilizes circumferential creeping waves propagating around the inner surface of the hole to perform the inspection. However, the wet wing has to be emptied and dried out before inspection because even a small amount of fluid fuel trapped in these rather small (approximately 6 – 7 mm in diameter) holes would strongly affect the propagation of circumferential creeping waves. We have searched the literature for published results on circumferential creeping wave propagation around fluid-filled cylindrical cavities in elastic media. Surprisingly, although the analytical solution of this canonical problem can be readily constructed from existing building blocks, very little was found in terms of numerical results that could be used to gain better understanding of the phenomenon. This motivated us to attack the problem by numerically solving the dispersion equation and constructing the corresponding dispersion and attenuation curves for a specific case of interest, namely, for that of a water-filled cylindrical hole in aluminum...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{an investigation into}} the scattering of the fundamental Lamb, shear horizontal and edge-guided Rayleigh-type wave modes from sub-surface and hard-to-inspect damage on cavities representative of fuel weep holes in integral stiffeners. Detection, localisation and characterisation of scattered elastic guided wave fields can assist with improving the reliability and probability of detection of health monitoring systems through informed placement of actuators and sensors. The combination of the experimental-computational-analytical approach gives rise to new insights and guidance for the quantification of defects located in hard-to-inspect regions with actuators and sensors placed in easily accessible locations. Three-dimensional laser vibrometry is used to confirm that ultrasonic guided plate waves, generated by permanently bonded low-profile surface-mounted piezoceramic disc transducers, are able to form edge-guided Rayleigh-type waves on the free surface of open cavities. The behaviour of the propagating ultrasonic guided waves around cavities and their interaction with simulated fatigue damage emanating from the cavities is visualised. In situ non-destructive evaluation of the airframe stiffener is shown to be viable using symmetric guided waves given that the strength of the characteristic scattered spiralling guided wave field maintains its form and grows in amplitude as the damage length in increased. In contrast to the high frequency bulk-wave wedge transducer methodology traditionally used for <b>weep</b> <b>hole</b> inspection, the length-scales of the in situ technique are such that the wavelength of the incident guided waves are comparable with the hole diameter, and larger than the defect length. The monitoring of upward growing hidden damage from circular weep holes in integral stiffeners using symmetric guided waves is unique in that the received energy, that is the measured surface velocity on the accessible surface, monotonically increases with respect to increasing damage length. A series of computational studies with a three-dimensional finite element model is conducted to understand how and why scattered plate waves from the defect can be detected on the accessible surface. The ability to accurately model acousto-ultrasonic elastic wave dynamics is crucial for future developments in this research field. The computational results are compared with the experimental laser vibrometry data for model validation. It is concluded that the boundary conditions for wave scattering from the hidden notch are a complex combination of the incident wave field and the dispersive edge-guided Rayleigh-type wave that is formed on the free surface of the cavity...|$|E

40|$|Underground sewage {{pipe systems}} {{deteriorate}} over time resulting in cracks and joint defects. Sewage thus leaks out and contaminates the surrounding groundwater {{and the surface}} water in stormwater drains. Many studies have investigated the problem of sewage leakage but no published studies, to the best knowledge of the authors, have examined the hydrologic interactions between leaky sewage pipes, groundwater and stormwater drains. This study numerically models such interactions using generic conditions in Singapore. It first develops accurate representations of <b>weep</b> <b>holes</b> and leaky sewage pipes, and further shows the long-term and short-term system responses to rainfall events. Some of the implications include: (1) quality of water seeping into the drains tends to be low in dry years; (2) complete contaminant attenuation after pipe rehabilitation takes several years; (3) responses to rainfall events at <b>weep</b> <b>holes</b> are immediate but the effects on sewage leakage might only show up a few days later. The simulation results allow us {{to better understand the}} local-scale migration of sewage leakage from a sewage pipe to nearby stormwater drains.

50|$|A weeping tile (also {{called a}} drain tile or {{perimeter}} tile) is a porous pipe used for underground water collection or discharge. Named {{in the time}} period when drainpipes were made from terracotta tiles, the modern material is typically a length of corrugated plastic pipe with small slits or <b>weep</b> <b>holes</b> in it, which is buried surrounded by aggregate larger than the slits. The aggregate rocks prevent excessive soil from falling through the slits into the weeping tile. With this arrangement, water in the surrounding soil above the weeping tile flows into the weeping tile. The weeping tile then drains into a solid pipe leading to a discharge or directly into a sump, where the water can be removed by a sump pump.|$|R
50|$|Screens with {{apertures}} {{small enough}} to block termites were developed in Australia and have widely used in the United States, mostly for plumbing penetrations, since the 1990s. One of the early uses of screens for pest exclusion was the implementation of screen doors and window coverings. Screens are required by building codes at vent openings. To exclude rats, screen openings must be ½” (13.7 mm) or smaller. To exclude mice, a screen aperture size of ¼” or smaller is required. Most insects can be excluded with screens measuring 1/16” (1.59mm) in aperture size, but to effectively exclude subterranean termites, required screen apertures measure 1/55” (0.46 mm). Application areas for screens in the building envelope include <b>weep</b> <b>holes,</b> soffits, gable and ridge vents, among others.|$|R

The air is infiltrated through the gaskets, through imperfect joinery between the horizontal and vertical mullions, through <b>weep</b> <b>holes,</b> and through imperfect sealing. The American Architectural Manufacturers Association (AAMA) is an industry trade group in the U.S. that has developed voluntary specifications regarding acceptable levels of air infiltration through a curtain wall. This limit is expressed (in the USA) in cubic feet per minute per square foot of wall area at a given test pressure. (Currently, most standards cite maximum of 0.06 CFM/sq ft at a pressure of at least 1.57 psf or higher as acceptable.) Testing is typically conducted by an independent third party agency using the ASTM E-783 standard.|$|R

50|$|A masonry veneer wall {{consists}} of masonry units, usually clay-based bricks, installed {{on one or}} {{both sides of a}} structurally independent wall usually constructed of wood or masonry. In this context the brick masonry is primarily decorative, not structural. The brick veneer is generally connected to the structural wall by brick ties (metal strips that are attached to the structural wall, as well as the mortar joints of the brick veneer). There is typically an air gap between the brick veneer and the structural wall. As clay-based brick is usually not completely waterproof, the structural wall will often have a water-resistant surface (usually tar paper) and <b>weep</b> <b>holes</b> can be left {{at the base of the}} brick veneer to drain moisture that accumulates inside the air gap. Concrete blocks, real and cultured stones, and veneer adobe are sometimes used in a very similar veneer fashion.|$|R
25|$|Sand {{filters are}} a {{variation}} of the infiltration trench principle and operate in a way similar to bioretention systems. Stormwater is passed through them for treatment prior to discharge to the downstream stormwater system. Sand filters are very useful in treating runoff from confined hard surfaces such as car parks and from heavily urbanised and built-up areas. They usually do not support vegetation owing to the filtration media (sand) not retaining sufficient moisture and because they are usually installed underground. The filter usually consists of a sedimentation chamber as pre-treatment device to remove litter, debris, gross pollutants and medium-sized sediments; a weir; followed by a sand layer that filters sediments, finer particulates and dissolved pollutants. The filtered water is collected by perforated underdrain pipes in a similar manner as in bioretention systems. Systems may also have an overflow chamber. The sedimentation chamber can have permanent water or can be designed to be drained with <b>weep</b> <b>holes</b> between storm events. Permanent water storage however, can risk anaerobic conditions that can lead to the release of pollutants (e.g. phosphorus). The design process should consider the provision of detention storage to yield a high hydrologic effectiveness, and discharge control by proper sizing of the perforated underdrain and overflow path. Regular maintenance is required to prevent crust forming.|$|R
40|$|A common rain control {{strategy}} to help minimize moisture damage is the rain screen wall system. This approach requires a rainscreen, a drainage plane, flashing, <b>weep</b> <b>holes,</b> and a drainage gap. Although {{this approach to}} rain control is becoming the most common, and is sometimes even mandated by codes and standards, very {{little research has been}} undertaken to define the minimum or optimal gap size required for either drainage or ventilation drying. A test method and experimental program were developed to investigate the gap size required to ensure drainage, and the role of small gaps on ventilation drying. Because of the importance of small geometrical details, full-scale wall systems were tested. The experimental method was able to gravimetrically determine the amount of drainage, storage and drying during and after a simulated wetting event. The test apparatus and method developed were shown to provide repeatable results over multiple tests as well as in an independent laboratory. The experiments to date have conclusively shown that even small gaps (less than 1 mm) can drain more water than would normally be found in a drainage gap. It was also found that in some cases small gaps will store less water than a large drainage gap. It was also found that ventilation drying can play a role in very small gaps of approximately 1 mm, at a pressure difference of only 1 Pa. More research is required to further analyze optimal ventilation gap sizes and compare the laboratory results to hygrothermal modeling...|$|R
