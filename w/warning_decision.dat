40|$|The {{past decade}} has seen the {{operational}} flood forecasting community increasingly using Hydrological Ensemble Prediction Systems (HEPS) for their forecasts. Many research studies {{over the past decade}} have shown that HEPS-based forecasts add value and can increase warning lead times. However, despite this, at present only a few flood forecasting centres around the world implement HEPS flood forecasting systems operationally (for a summary see Cloke & Pappenberger, 2009). There are many reasons for this, including a range of scientific, technical and cultural issues. For example, HEPS must receive and process large amounts of data generated by medium-range Ensemble Prediction System (EPS) weather forecasts (Thielen et al., 2008; Zappa et al., 2008). Furthermore, the computational burden of computing the flood forecasts themselves is also significant, as are the difficulties in understanding how best to base flood <b>warning</b> <b>decisions</b> on probabilistic forecasts.

40|$|Two {{important}} defensive mechanisms {{available to}} governments combating terrorism are warnings and {{the deployment of}} physical resources. Warnings are relatively inexpensive to issue but their effectiveness suffers from false alarms. Physical deployments of trained security personnel can directly thwart attacks but are expensive {{and need to be}} targeted to specific locations. In this paper, we model the joint optimization of defenses against terrorist attacks based on warnings and physical deployments when there is uncertainty in the timing and location of attacks. We model both private warnings issued to security forces and public warnings broadcast to the general public. By structuring the trade-offs faced by decision makers in a formal way, we try to shed light on an important public policy problem. We show that the interaction between the use of warnings and physical defenses is complex and significant. For public warnings, we also model the possible response of terrorists and show how these responses influence the effectiveness of such <b>warnings.</b> <b>decision</b> analysis, risk, military, defense systems, government, defense...|$|R

40|$|The {{rear-end}} collision warning system requires reliable <b>warning</b> <b>decision</b> mechanism {{to adapt the}} actual driving situation. To overcome the shortcomings of existing warning methods, an adaptive strategy is proposed to address the practical aspects of the collision warning problem. The proposed strategy {{is based on the}} parameter-adaptive and variable-threshold approaches. First, several key parameter estimation algorithms are developed to provide more accurate and reliable information for subsequent warning method. They include a two-stage algorithm which contains a Kalman filter and a Luenberger observer for relative acceleration estimation, a Bayesian theory-based algorithm of estimating the road friction coefficient, and an artificial neural network for estimating the driver’s reaction time. Further, the variable-threshold warning method is designed to achieve the global <b>warning</b> <b>decision.</b> In the method, the safety distance is employed to judge the dangerous state. The calculation method of the safety distance in this paper can be adaptively adjusted according to the different driving conditions of the leading vehicle. Due to the real-time estimation of the key parameters and the adaptive calculation of the warning threshold, the strategy can adapt to various road and driving conditions. Finally, the proposed strategy is evaluated through simulation and field tests. The experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed strategy...|$|E

40|$|New West Coast/Alaska Tsunami Warning Center (WCATWC) {{response}} {{criteria for}} earthquakes {{occurring in the}} Pacific basin are presented. Initial <b>warning</b> <b>decisions</b> are based on earthquake location, magnitude, depth, and - dependent on magnitude - either distance from source or pre- computed threat estimates generated from tsunami models. The new criteria will help limit the geographical extent of warnings and advisories to threatened regions, and complement the new operational tsunami product suite. Changes to the previous criteria include: adding hypocentral depth dependence, reducing geographical warning extent for the lower magnitude ranges, setting special criteria for areas not well-connected to the open ocean, basing warning extent on pre-computed threat levels versus tsunami travel time for very large events, including the new advisory product, using the advisory product for far-offshore events in the lower magnitude ranges, and specifying distances from the coast for on-shore events which may be tsunamigenic. This report sets a baseline for response criteria used by the WCATWC considering its processing and observational data capabilities {{as well as its}} organizational requirements. Criteria are set for tsunamis generated by earthquakes, which are by far the main cause of tsunami generation (either directly through sea floor displacement or indirectly by triggering of slumps).

40|$|While {{the spring}} and summer months are {{typically}} the severe weather climatological peak for the East-Central United States, severe thunderstorms and deadly regional tornado outbreaks can occur during the cool season months (e. g., October-March). In an effort to better document and improve operational forecasting of these events, this study focuses on cool season severe thunderstorms in the Ohio and Tennessee Valleys during the 1995 - 2002 cool seasons. Most severe thunderstorm and tornado events in the East-Central United States during the cool season are characterized by a high frequency of wind reports compared to hail and tornado reports. All severe report classes (i. e. tornadoes, hail, and wind) displayed a frequency tendency to remain high in the late evening and overnight hours. Additionally, it was found that tornado occurrence typically {{came in the form of}} a tornado outbreak. Additionally, when tornadoes did occur, they were found to be statistically more intense than tornadoes outside of the EC region during the same period. It is also concluded tornadoes favor the southern half of the region, whereas hail and wind reports tend to favor the southern two thirds of the region. In examination of cool season supercell characteristics, supercells favors a west-southwest to east-northeast mean motion around 45 mph. The relationship of only 11 percent between the distances of supercell tornado paths to tornadic supercell paths is an operationally important discovery. Knowing on average, how long a cool season supercell tornado is on the ground with respect to the parent supercell can aid operational <b>warning</b> <b>decisions.</b> Department of GeographyThesis (M.

40|$|An upper-level {{undergraduate}} course entitled "Radar and Satellite Meteorology" {{has offered}} {{for the past}} five years at the Department of Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences, University of Wisconsin-Madison. This course has two components, one is the lectures on remote sensing theory, and the other is laboratory exercises that involve the investigation of archived radar and satellite data. One of the most popular laboratory exercises, according to the students' feedback, is the simulated real-time severe weather nowcasting in the computer-equipped classroom. The students are experienced a severe weather outbreak and placed in a real-time operational decision-making environment. Archived Level-II and Level-III Next-generation Radar (NEXRAD) data is viewed with either the freely available Integrated Data Viewer (IDV) or McIDAS software packages. The "bundling" feature of these software packages allows the instructor to pre-package radar data (e. g., reflectivity, storm-relative Doppler velocity) and feed it to the students every four to five minutes, simulating the delay between radar volume scans. Teams of students are required to monitor the evolution of the situation and issue severe weather warnings based on radar analysis skills developed in lecture and previous labs. Documented storm reports are also integrated into the lab to assist — or sometimes detract from — the students' <b>warning</b> <b>decisions,</b> and the classroom clock is even adjusted to correspond with the time of the events. This exercise provides students with a unique operational experience that is often missing from the undergraduate curriculum.
