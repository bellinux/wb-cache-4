5|$|Gaddafi briefly studied History at the University of Libya in Benghazi, before {{dropping}} out {{to join the}} military. Despite his police record, in 1963 he began training at the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi, alongside several like-minded friends from Misrata. The armed forces offered the only opportunity for upward social mobility for underprivileged Libyans, and Gaddafi recognized it as a potential instrument of political change. Under Idris, Libya's armed forces were trained by the British military; this angered Gaddafi, who viewed the British as imperialists, and accordingly he refused to learn English and <b>was</b> <b>rude</b> to the British officers, ultimately failing his exams. British trainers reported him for insubordination and abusive behaviour, stating their suspicion {{that he was involved}} in the assassination of the military academy's commander in 1963. Such reports were ignored and Gaddafi quickly progressed through the course.|$|E
25|$|Huyck and Katz {{began to}} develop ideas for the film. Early on in the production, {{it was decided that}} the {{personality}} of the character would be changed from that of the comics, in which Howard <b>was</b> <b>rude</b> and obnoxious, to make the character nicer. Gerber read over the script and offered his comments and suggestions. In addition, Hyuck and Katz met with Gerber to discuss a horror sequence with which they were having difficulty.|$|E

500|$|Social context {{involves}} {{pointing out}} social norms and violations of these norms. This form of context is most {{commonly found in}} conversation, as opposed to reading or other word learning environments. A child's understanding of social norms can help them to infer the meaning of words that occur in conversation. In an English-speaking tradition, [...] "please" [...] and [...] "thank you" [...] are taught to children {{at a very early}} age, so they are very familiar to the child by school-age. For example, if a group of people is eating a meal with the child present and one person says, [...] "give me the bread" [...] and another responds with, [...] "that <b>was</b> <b>rude.</b> What do you say?", and the person responds with [...] "please", the child may not know the meaning of [...] "rude", but can infer its meaning through social context and understanding the necessity of saying [...] "please".|$|E
500|$|At a coroner's inquest, several {{witnesses}} had {{testified that}} they saw Shay shoot Euell after an argument over a sugar bowl. Anderson said {{that she did not}} see much after the initial verbal exchange because she fled the dining area as soon as the argument escalated. At trial, Anderson said that Shay had two drinks at the cafe. She said that Euell had been staring at her, <b>was</b> <b>rude</b> to them and lunged toward Shay before the shooting. The cafe's manager said that Euell had not been rude to Shay. Two waiters denied that Euell had lunged at Shay. A cashier testified that when Shay asked for sugar, Euell pointed out that there was already some on his table, but he brought two more bowls. She said that Shay called Euell [...] "smarty" [...] and confronted Euell with the gun while the waiter was walking away. Shay denied being drunk and said that Euell hit him and threatened to kill him before the shooting.|$|E
500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on November 18, 1910. The film had a wide national release, with advertising theaters known in Kansas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Nebraska, Arizona, Missouri, Texas, and Pennsylvania. The only known trade publication review is by The Moving Picture World {{and it is a}} positive one. The reviewer states, [...] "A clear presentation of the visions of a child who {{wanted to go to the}} city. The vision is, perhaps, a bit more beatific than the actual city, but it unquestionably represents the imagined city of those who have never seen it. The awakening <b>was</b> <b>rude,</b> but happily the vision becomes real when the father appears with sufficient money to take the dreamer to the city for which she has longed. The acting and mechanical work on this picture are both of excellent quality." [...] Another minor review of theater productions in the Arkansas City Daily Traveler said it was a good production.|$|E

2500|$|As deputy {{assistant}} to the president, Butterfield was Haldeman's chief assistant. His first few days in the White House were difficult. Butterfield {{did not meet the}} president for 13 days. When Haldeman finally introduced Butterfield to Nixon, their meeting was short and awkward. Haldeman then left for California, leaving Butterfield in charge of the White House staff for four days. During the second meeting with Butterfield, Nixon <b>was</b> <b>rude</b> and condescending, and Butterfield nearly resigned. The following day, however, Nixon was cordial and witty, and Butterfield resolved to stay at the White House. Butterfield, who came to like Nixon immensely, nevertheless, felt the president was an [...] "ignorant boor, a bumpkin". Initially, when meeting with Nixon, Butterfield had to mimic Haldeman's manerisms and to duplicate his managerial style. Everything Haldeman and Butterfield did was designed to make Nixon feel comfortable and relaxed, never surprised or [...] "spooked". [...] "If you don't do things exactly as I do, it could upset ," [...] Haldeman told him.|$|E
2500|$|They also {{disagreed}} on {{the nature}} of the Soviet state. Lenin called for the country to be renamed the [...] "Union of Soviet Republics of Europe and Asia", reflecting his desire for expansion across the two continents. Stalin believed that this would encourage independence sentiment among non-Russians, instead arguing that ethnic minorities would be content as [...] "autonomous republics" [...] within the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Lenin accused Stalin of [...] "Great Russian chauvinism"; Stalin accused Lenin of [...] "national liberalism". A compromise was reached, in which the country would be renamed the [...] "Union of Soviet Socialist Republics" [...] (USSR). The USSR's formation was ratified in December 1922; although officially a federal system, all major decisions were taken by the Politburo in Moscow. Their differences were not just based on policy but also became personal; Lenin was particularly angered when Stalin <b>was</b> <b>rude</b> to his wife Krupskaya during a telephone conversation. In the final years of his life, Lenin dictated increasingly disparaging notes on Stalin that became his testament. He criticized Stalin's rude manners and excessive power, suggesting that Stalin should be removed from the position of General Secretary.|$|E
2500|$|Brown caused {{problems}} for Fred Trueman when he managed the English cricket team in Australia in 1958–59. Trueman and others believed {{that people like}} Brown and his colleague Gubby Allen [...] "epitomised the pompous nature of English cricket {{in the days of}} amateurs and professionals, gentlemen and players". It was not just professionals as Brown quarreled with the amateur Trevor Bailey, which led to long-standing mutual antipathy. In Trueman's autobiography, he refers to Brown as [...] "a snob, bad-mannered, ignorant and a bigot". Trueman made a formal complaint about Brown to the team captain, Peter May. Although May was another public school-educated amateur, he supported Trueman and told Brown to [...] "act in a manner befitting someone with managerial responsibility". Tom Graveney commented on the lack of team spirit on the tour, saying that [...] "Freddie Brown, in particular, did a very bad job" [...] and <b>was</b> <b>rude</b> to several team members. Graveney called Brown [...] "a very stuck-up individual – at least when he was sober". Kay said Brown had a tendency to be bombastic in speech and could be forthright and ruthless, sometimes being churlish and rude to sensation-seeking reporters, but was always ready to talk amicably to genuine cricket journalists.|$|E

2500|$|His {{ability to}} {{correctly}} identify the biggest goats {{of a game}} is also widely admired, particularly when contrasted to archrival Russell Hantz's inability to not only keep the respect of a jury as Rob can, but to accurately judge the weakest opponents {{to bring to the}} end as Rob does. [...] However, many fans criticize Rob for his huge advantage in being a four-time player and having no real competition the entire season, giving him perhaps the easiest win in Survivor history. His tribemates were criticized for being too starstruck to act against Rob. Some fans also criticize him for probably having been unable to beat anyone other than his 2 ultimate goats (based upon cast interviews, amongst other indicators). [...] The jury has even indicated Phillip Sheppard could have beaten him had he followed through with his plan to [...] "own his game" [...] and reveal that he had purposely played the villain role to get taken to the end by Rob, and in doing so had duped Rob and his entire alliance. Instead Sheppard <b>was</b> <b>rude,</b> lashed out at Julie Wolfe after she had asked him if his son would be proud of the way he played the game, and gave all the credit to Rob, thus receiving only 1 vote (from Ralph Kiser, the one jury member Phillip showed respect towards at Final Tribal and throughout the game) and giving Rob the easy finish glove side.|$|E
