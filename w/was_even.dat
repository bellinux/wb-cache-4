5|$|After the First World War {{the canal}} {{remained}} {{in a state}} of limbo – with minimal maintenance by the railway company – and was the haunt of fishermen and walkers. The Conservators continued their annual inspections, and the infrastructure remained in remarkably good order, compared to many other closed canals. The section near Creech St Michael <b>was</b> <b>even</b> used for swimming lessons for the local school children in the 1930s.|$|E

5|$|Although {{influenced}} by Matisse, the Oriental art that Jolin discovered at Musée Guimet <b>was</b> <b>even</b> {{more important to}} his style. Chinese and Japanese art became the base for the decorative, slightly naïve style in light colours, that he developed during the 1910s and 1920s. Jolin's style deviates {{from that of the}} traditional Expressionists, in that he simplifies his motifs in an almost primitive way, painting an imagined reality rather than raw emotions.|$|E
5|$|Danton was a semi-dreadnought {{battleship}} of the French Navy and {{the lead}} ship of her class. She was a technological leap in battleship development for the French Navy, as {{she was the first}} ship in the fleet with turbine engines. However, like all battleships of her type, she was completed after the Royal Navy battleship , and as such she was outclassed before she <b>was</b> <b>even</b> commissioned.|$|E
5|$|Ernuszt was strangled in {{the summer}} of 1505 by his three {{retainers}} (including Albert Cupi, Dean of Baranya) who wanted to seize his wealth. His brother, John Ernuszt, brought charges against the assassins, but they were never sentenced. Cupi <b>was</b> <b>even</b> employed by Ernuszt's successor, George Szatmári. During the investigation which followed his murder, 300,000 gold florins were found and confiscated for the royal treasury.|$|E
5000|$|A number (i.e., integer) {{expressed}} in the decimal numeral system <b>is</b> <b>even</b> or odd according to whether its last digit <b>is</b> <b>even</b> or odd.That <b>is,</b> if the last digit is 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9, then it is odd; otherwise it <b>is</b> <b>even.</b> The same idea will work using any even base.In particular, a number {{expressed in}} the binary numeral system is odd if its last digit <b>is</b> 1 and <b>even</b> if its last digit is 0.In an odd base, the number <b>is</b> <b>even</b> according to {{the sum of its}} digits [...] - [...] it <b>is</b> <b>even</b> if and only if the sum of its digits <b>is</b> <b>even.</b>|$|R
25|$|Recall {{that the}} square of an <b>even</b> number <b>is</b> <b>even</b> and {{the square of}} an odd number is odd. So if {{the square of the}} {{hypotenuse}} <b>is</b> <b>even</b> the hypotenuse <b>is</b> <b>even</b> as well.|$|R

In addition, his time at Michigan defined an era {{in a way that}} became a permanent reference because his contemporaries would say that they were at Michigan in the Chappuis years. In 1988, he was elected into the College Football Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the differences mentioned above, numerous other, local modifications of the structure, harmony or texture were applied to the original material. In these modifications, certain uniquely 'daring' original progressions were occasionally toned down, whereas in other places, the new version <b>was</b> <b>even</b> bolder than its predecessor.|$|E

5|$|In the Spring of 1924, Göppert {{entered the}} University of Göttingen, where she studied mathematics.

5|$|Like {{nearly all}} antibiotics, {{linezolid}} {{has been associated}} with Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD) and pseudomembranous colitis, although the latter is uncommon, occurring in about one in two thousand patients in clinical trials.

5|$|Like other abelisaurids, the hindlimbs were stocky {{and short}} {{compared}} to body length. The tibia (lower leg bone) of Majungasaurus <b>was</b> <b>even</b> stockier {{than that of}} its relative Carnotaurus, with a prominent crest on the knee. The astragalus and calcaneum (ankle bones) were fused together, and the feet bore three functional digits, with a smaller first digit that did not contact the ground.|$|E

5|$|M-91 {{was formed}} when M-66 was rerouted in the 1940s. At the time, the highway {{continued}} south to Lowell, but subsequent transfers or roadway sections have truncated {{the route to}} its present form. For a time period in the 1980s, M-91 <b>was</b> <b>even</b> a discontinuous highway when a section in the middle was transferred to county control before the southernmost section was transferred.|$|E
5|$|On June 16, nearly {{identical}} ultimata were issued to Latvia and Estonia, {{although they were}} given only eight hours to respond. With Lithuania already in Soviet hands, armed resistance in Latvia or Estonia <b>was</b> <b>even</b> more futile. All three states were occupied and lost their independence.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying for UEFA Euro 2012 {{ended in}} {{familiar}} fashion; they lost all ten matches, scoring only one goal and conceding 25; their best results were two one-goal losses to Slovakia and a 3–1 loss in Ireland.

5|$|Thanks to {{its status}} as a {{first-class}} fortification, Fort Stanton continued to receive regular maintenance and was continually garrisoned even after the final armistice. Work <b>was</b> <b>even</b> done to strengthen the defenses, as a stockade was added in the summer of 1865, and the parapets of the fort were re-sodded with fresh grass for better traction and to improve the look of the fortification.|$|E
5|$|The {{cultural}} {{impact of}} the Second Crusade <b>was</b> <b>even</b> greater in France, with many troubadours fascinated by the alleged affair between Eleanor and Raymond, which helped to feed the theme of courtly love.
