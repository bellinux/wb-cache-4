50|$|Snubbing {{is a type}} {{of heavy}} well {{intervention}} performed on oil and gas wells. It involves running the BHA on a pipe string using a hydraulic <b>workover</b> <b>rig.</b> Unlike wireline or coiled tubing, the pipe is not spooled off a drum but made up and broken up while running in and pulling out, much like conventional drill pipe. Due to the large rigup, it is only used for the most demanding of operations when lighter intervention techniques do not offer the strength and durability. Unlike conventional drilling and completions operations, snubbing can be performed with the well still under pressure (not killed). When done so, it is called hydraulic workover. It can also be performed without having to remove the Christmas tree from the wellhead.|$|E

40|$|RLWI is an {{important}} part of Statoil’s goal of increasing the recovery factor from subsea wells from 42 % to 55 %. Subsea well intervention has traditionally been performed by expensive <b>workover</b> <b>rigs</b> which have made intervention for subsea wells less desirable than for platform wells. The introduction of RLWI has made subsea well intervention more desirable. To make it even more desirable, limitation and problems needs to be identified and improved. After investigating 68 RLWI operation performed for Statoil by the Island Offshore Alliance, the three problems with the highest frequency were identify to be; scale related, difficulties pulling the THCP and fish left in the hole. A HXT vs. VXT time analysis showed that RLWI operations takes about two days longer to perform on wells with HXT. The main reason for this difference is because a THCP needs to be pulled, which runs into difficulties 40 % of the time. A RLWI will always take longer time for HXT because the THCP needs to be pulled, but the time difference could be reduced by applying a proper THCP pulling procedure. An important part of improving the THCP pulling procedure is to improve the jarring operation. Drag force acting on the wireline by the sea current have the potential to reduce the sensitiveness of the jarring operation. The drag force can reached 1 380 N on the 7 / 32 ” braided line during worst case scenario, which creates a deflection of 23 m at 300 m water depth and a TS weight of 2 000 N. The drag force can be reduced by developing a wireline with higher specific weight, smoother surface and smaller diameter. Or the drag force can be eliminated by placing the wireline winch on the sea bottom. Oil field scale deposit is a big problem for many fields world wide as many fields are getting older. Scale deposit in the well is the reason for many intervention complications such as; high friction in the well, unable to install/RIH downhole equipment and stuck downhole valves and chokes. The introduction of the rotating PTA tractor has provided a cost efficient scale removal technique from electrical wireline. The technique has however two major disadvantages compared to CT and snubbing; the power available downhole is very limited and fluid circulation is impossible. Because of these limitations the technique can only remove relative short soft scale bridges due to the limitation in available downhole power, and the scale bridge cannot completely block the fluid because that makes it impossible to remove the debris. A new wireline called CC can however dramatically increase the available downhole power, but fluid circulation will be impossible to achieve with wireline. Whenever a fish is left in the well it must be investigated what went wrong to avoid the similar incidents in the future. Three cases have been looked into in this report where a fish was left in the hole: o Fish left in hole due too to small ID in the TFL completion solution, the TFL is not a very intervention friendly completion o Fish left in hole because of perforating in too high overbalance. If high overbalance is suspected the TS could be anchored in place to avoid it from being flushed up the well, or the well could be shut in prior to perforating. o Fish likely left in hole because of wrongly installed muleshoe in the tailpipe. The self aligned muleshoe has a spring loaded inner part which has a cushioning effect on the jarring operations, which makes it difficult to jar the TS free. Whenever a muleshoe is installed a caliper run should be run to see if it is properly installed. RLWI has limitations and disadvantages compared to CT and snubbing, but with the development of new techniques and equipment the RLWI clearly has a huge potential to increase the recovery factor for subsea wells. New equipment and techniques will also be needed to perform intervention in constantly deeper and more complex wells. </p...|$|R

40|$|During the mid-l 980 's, Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE) drilled {{a number}} of deep wells (M- 200 series) at the Cerro Prieto {{geothermal}} field, Baja California, Mexico to investigate {{the continuation of the}} geothermal reservoir to the east of the Cerro Prieto-II and III production areas. The wells encountered permeability at depths ranging from 2, 800 to 4, 400 m but due to the reservoir depth and the relatively cold temperatures encountered in the upper 1, 000 to 2, 000 m of the wells, {{it was not possible to}} discharge some of the wells. The wells at Cerro Prieto are generally discharged by injecting compressed air below the water level using 2 - 3 / 8 -inch tubing installed with either a crane or <b>workover</b> <b>rig.</b> The objective of this technique is to lift sufficient water out of the well to stimulate flow from the reservoir into the wellbore. However, in the case of the M- 200 series wells, the temperatures in the upper 1, 000 to 2, 000 m are generally below 50 C and the heat loss to the formation is therefore significant. The impact of heat loss on the stimulation process was evaluated using both a numerical model of the reservoir/wellbore system and steady-state wellbore modeling. The results from the study indicate that if a flow rate of at least 300 liters/minute can be sustained, the well can probably be successfully stimulated. This is consistent with the flow rates obtained during the successful stimulations of wells M- 202 and M- 203. If the flow rate is closer to 60 liters/minute, the heat loss is significant and it is unlikely that the well can be successfully discharged.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of this thesis are {{to describe the}} Subsea Well Intervention System (SWIS) andto test the hypothesis that this system has significant potential economic benefits over asemi-submersible rig-based system which is normally used for completing common subseawell intervention procedures. These interventions are carried out in water depths from 200 mto 3, 000 m. This thesis describes SWIS and its applications to subsea well interventions, discusses themain technical issues involved and provides an economic analysis of the cost benefit incomparison to semi-submersible and Drill Ship rig-based systems. Examples of subsea wellinterventions discussed in this thesis include: de-sanding, de-scaling, re-entry drilling andwellhead recovery. A discussion {{and analysis of the}} vessel response to the likely operatingsea states and an analysis of heave compensation for the Coiled Tubing (CT) system isincluded as these are critical factors to the technical viability of SWIS. SWIS is designed to have a light to medium level well intervention capability and it willprovide a tool for common subsea well intervention procedures. It is not designed for tubingchange out which is classified as a heavy level workover. In this case a conventional rig or aHydraulic <b>Workover</b> <b>rig</b> supported by a semi-submersible would be used. SWIS will be designed to include the following capabilities: Well and field abandonment;Artificial Lift Services; Re-entry Drilling using CT including well side tracking anddeepening operations (Operations to include CT under-balanced drilling and ThroughTubing); Deployment and recovery of Sand Control Screens using CT as a conveying tool;Through Tubing Completions using CT as a conveying tool; Post-completion well clean-upoperations; Slick-line and electric line operations and sub-sea wellhead maintenance andrecovery. The SWIS concept vessel is a large scale wave piercing catamaran which will be maintainedon station and heading into the prevailing sea using a Dynamic Positioning System (DPS). Initial modelling of the response of the vessel to typical expected operating sea stateconditions is encouraging because the results indicate that this type of vessel will provide astable platform from which to carry out typical subsea well intervention procedures. The modelling has demonstrated that the vessel motions (other than heave) are minimalunder the expected operating conditions and will be compensated by the Spooled CompositeRiser (SCR) and the CT. The heave amplitude and heave acceleration of the centre of gravity of the vessel will besuch that an off the shelf heave compensation system is available for the Spooled CompositeRiser (SCR). Research has indicated that existing CT heave compensation systems can bereadily modified for use with SWIS to provide the required level of motion compensation tocarry out intervention procedures in moderately rough seas. The hypothesis that a catamaran based platform used for the above purpose has significantpotential economic benefits over a semi-submersible for common types of interventionprocedures is supported by the research completed. It is concluded that the savings resultingfrom the use of the SWIS vessel compared to a semi-submersible would be around USD 360, 000 per day. It is also concluded from the research and modelling completed that SWIS is a technicallyand economically viable system. Based on the survey carried out it has the potential for ahigh degree of utilization in the East Asian and Australian offshore regions due of the abovecost saving. It also has the potential for a high degree of utilisation in other offshore regions such as Brazil and West Africa where sea states are light to moderate...|$|E
