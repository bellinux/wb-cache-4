[...] "Nature Boy" [...] was {{initially}} arranged as a techno song with singer David Bowie's vocals, before {{being sent to the}} group Massive Attack, whose remix was used in the film's closing credits. Bowie described the rendition as [...] "slinky and mysterious", adding that Robert '3D' Del Naja from the group had [...] "put together a riveting piece of work," [...] and that Bowie was [...] "totally pleased with the end result." [...] Both Bowie's version and Massive Attack's remix appeared on the soundtrack. The version used in Moulin Rouge! was sung by John Leguizamo, as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, during the introductory scenes, as well as by Ewan McGregor's character, Christian. Some of the film's premise was based on the lyrics, in particular the opening lines. The closing lyric, [...] "The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be loved in return" [...] is used throughout the film. While reviewing Moulin Rouge!, Erickson noted that [...] " [...] itself, [...] redeems the <b>wonderful</b> <b>idea</b> behind Luhrmann's flawed but often wonderful movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1946, Winston Churchill {{travelled}} to Westminster College {{in order}} to deliver his famous [...] "Sinews of Peace" [...] address {{as a part of}} the Green Lecture series. [...] An extraordinary confluence of circumstances conspired to bring Winston Churchill to Westminster. [...] At the time, the College had a unique connection to U.S. President Harry S. Truman's administration—Major General Harry Vaughan, a graduate of Westminster College. [...] College president Franc McCluer asked Vaughan to see what President Truman could do to induce Churchill to come to Westminster. [...] President Truman thought the idea of bringing Churchill to Missouri (Truman's native state) was a <b>wonderful</b> <b>idea.</b> [...] On the bottom of Churchill's invitation from Westminster College Truman wrote: [...] "This is a wonderful school in my home state. [...] Hope you can do it. [...] I will introduce you." [...] So it was that two world leaders, Winston Churchill and President Harry Truman, descended onto the little campus of Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri.|$|E

2500|$|Critics who {{had seen}} the {{production}} in New York (such as Frank Rich) found it substantially more [...] "upbeat" [...] and lacking in the atmosphere it had originally possessed. According to the Associated Press (AP) reviewer, [...] "A revised version of the Broadway hit [...] "Follies" [...] received a standing ovation from its opening-night audience and raves from British critics, who said the show was worth a 16-year wait." [...] The AP quoted Michael Convey of The Financial Times, who wrote: [...] "'Follies' {{is a great deal}} more than a camp love-in for old burlesque buffs and Sondheim aficionados." [...] The New York Times critic wrote: [...] "The initial critics' reviews ranged from unqualified raves to some doubts whether the reworked book of James Goldman is up to the inventiveness of Sondheim's songs. 'A truly fantastic evening,' The Financial Times concluded, while The London Daily News said, 'The musical is inspired,' and The Times described the evening as 'a <b>wonderful</b> <b>idea</b> for a show which has failed to grow into a story.'" [...] He further commented: [...] "In part, the show is a tribute to musical stage history, in which the 57-year-old Mr. Sondheim is steeped, for he first learned song writing at the knee of Oscar Hammerstein II and became the acknowledged master songwriter who bridged past musical stage romance into the modern musical era of irony and neurosis. Follies is a blend of both, and the new production is rounded out with production numbers celebrating love's simple hope for young lovers, its extravagant fantasies for Ziegfeld aficionados, and its fresh lesson for the graying principals." ...|$|E

5000|$|Students {{bring their}} prior expectations, {{interests}} and {{knowledge to the}} learning experience: The students' experience and insights are of high value as {{the development of their}} personal intelligence emerges through actions and the having of <b>wonderful</b> <b>ideas.</b> To reach deep understanding, students need to start from their own sets of ideas, be engaged in the subject matter and make a connection from the actual problem or subject matter to what they already understand. Consequently, the students do the talking as they explain the sense they are making, while the teacher listens. However, this requires a learning culture that accommodates students in feeling free and safe to say what their emerging ideas are, and that what they say is valued (Duckworth in Meek, 1991).

60|$|Lodge {{had been}} a major-general in the Civil War just ended, and before that he had {{traveled}} through {{this part of the}} West many times, and always with the mighty project of a railroad looming in his mind. It had taken years to evolve the plan of a continental railroad, and it came to fruition at last through many men and devious ways, through plots and counterplots. The <b>wonderful</b> <b>idea</b> of uniting East and West by a railroad originated in one man's brain; he lived for it, and finally he died for it. But the seeds he had sown were fruitful. One by one other men divined and believed, despite doubt and fear, until the day arrived when Congress put the Government of the United States, the army, a group of frock-coated directors, and unlimited gold back of General Lodge, and bade him build the road.|$|E

Motivated by Brešar’s and Cheung’s <b>wonderful</b> <b>ideas,</b> we will study semi-centralizing maps of generalized matrix algebras and describe its general form by routine and complicated computations. Skew-commuting maps and semi-centralizing maps of generalized matrix algebras are specially considered. We prove that any skew-commuting map on a class of generalized matrix algebras is zero and that any semi-centralizing derivation on a generalized matrix algebra is zero. These results not only give new perspectives to the work of Brešar (2004) [6] but also extend the main results of Cheung (2001) [13]. A number of applications related to semi-centralizing maps are given...|$|R
