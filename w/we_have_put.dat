It {{is absolutely}} necessary for us {{to stop at the}} earliest possible time the nameless oppositions being perpetrated on the sons of the country who are now suffering the brutal punishment and tortures in jails, and because of this please let all the brethren know that on Saturday, the 29th of the current month, the revolution shall commence according to our agreement. For this purpose, it is necessary for all towns to rise simultaneously and attack Manila at the same time. Anybody who obstructs this sacred ideal of the people will be considered a traitor and an enemy, except if he is ill; or is not physically fit, in which case he shall be tried according to the regulations <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> in force.|$|E
500|$|His {{language}} {{became more}} forceful; the Jesuit Father Peter Finlay {{was described by}} Yeats {{as a man of}} [...] "monstrous discourtesy", and he lamented that, [...] "It is one of the glories of the Church in which I was born that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> our Bishops in their place in discussions requiring legislation". During his time in the Senate, Yeats further warned his colleagues: [...] "If you show that this country, southern Ireland, is going to be governed by Roman Catholic ideas and by Catholic ideas alone, you will never get the North... You will put a wedge {{in the midst of this}} nation". He memorably said of his fellow Irish Protestants, [...] "we are no petty people".|$|E

2500|$|In 1774, John Wilkinson {{invented a}} boring machine {{in which the}} shaft that held the cutting tool was {{supported}} on both ends and extended through the cylinder, unlike the cantilevered borers then in use. Boulton wrote in 1776 that [...] "Mr. Wilkinson has bored us several cylinders almost without error; that of 50 inches diameter, which <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> up at Tipton, does not err on the thickness of an old shilling in any part".|$|E

2500|$|The RAAF {{has shown}} {{interest}} in acquiring armed unmanned drones. Air Marshal Geoff Brown stated that [...] "it is certainly something <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> forward" [...] {{and that the}} Reaper {{was one of the}} force's highest priorities. As of February 2015 six ADF personnel are currently training on the General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper in two USAF bases. The RAAF is willing to spend A$300million on the platform and is believed to be preparing to purchase eight drones and two ground stations. In March 2017, it was reported that the acquisition program had been singled down to two UAV platforms: the MQ-9 Reaper and the IAI Heron. In September 2017, IAI accused the Australian government of giving preferential treatment to General Atomics.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2008, Layton posted {{an online}} video message {{speaking}} out {{in favour of}} net neutrality, torrent sites, video-sharing sites, and social-networking sites. In a separate interview he said that increasing corporate control [...] "is very, very dangerous and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> {{the whole issue of}} net neutrality right into the heart of our campaign platform", and that the Internet is [...] "a public tool for exchanging ideas and I particularly want to say that if we don’t fight to preserve it, we could lose it." [...] In the end, the NDP gained 8 new seats, taking its tally to 37. This result still left the NDP as Canada's fourth party, behind the Bloc Québécois with 50. The NDP managed to retain Outremont, held by Thomas Mulcair, its only seat in the province.|$|E

2500|$|In {{a speech}} at the National Defence University and Quaid-i-Azam University, Majid {{outlines}} that atomic deterrence against a possible aggression was a compulsion, and not a choice for Pakistan. [...] Majid exhorted to the world delegation at the NDU that, [...] "World must accept Pakistan as nuclear power." [...] While dismissing all the concerns on the safety of country's nuclear arsenal, Majid maintains to the fact: [...] "We are shouldering our responsibility with utmost vigilance and confidence. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> in place a very robust regime that includes [...] "multilayered mechanisms" [...] and processes to secure our strategic assets, and have provided maximum transparency on our practices. We have reassured the international community on this issue over and over again and our track record since the time our atomic bomb programme was made overt has been unblemished".|$|E
2500|$|A {{representative}} of the original trawling syndicate that purchased the Koraaga said yesterday: [...] "We started with everything against us. State administration had muddled every path we wanted to take. We were told that people would not eat trawled fish. We were told that trawled fish could not be landed fresh. We were told we should not make our running expenses. To-day we are doing everything that the State industry at tempted, and are making it pay. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> the trawling industry firmly on its feet. We started off with no better equipment than the State, and with handicaps Imposed on us by the State., But throughout we had the advantages of business administration and of cleanliness. As for the profits to be made, take our own case. Our profits have long since repaid us the cost of our trawler. We have Just floated ourselves into a company, with a capital of £20,000. We are looking round now in Scotland for a second trawler. We have only begun to show the possibilities of the industry. There are further big developments to come." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ryan {{helped to}} renew the {{national}} debate on capital punishment when, as governor, he declared a moratorium on his state's death penalty in 2000. [...] "We have now freed more people than <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> to death under our system," [...] he said. [...] "There is a flaw in the system, without question, {{and it needs to}} be studied." [...] At the time, Illinois had executed 12 people since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1977, with one execution, that of Ripper Crew member Andrew Kokoraleis, occurring early during Ryan's term. Ryan refused to meet with religious leaders and others regarding [...] "a stay of execution" [...] in light of the impending 'moratorium' and other facts relative to the 'flawed' capital punishment system in Illinois; in fact, under Ryan's governorship, 13 people were released from jail after appealing their convictions based on new evidence. Ryan called for a commission to study the issue, while noting, [...] "I still believe the death penalty is a proper response to heinous crimes ... But I believe that it has to be where we don't put innocent people to death." ...|$|E
2500|$|Senator Feinstein {{has been}} one of Congress's strongest advocates for victims' rights. In the 1990s, Senator Feinstein was one of the {{original}} sponsors, along with Republican Senator Jon Kyl, of an effort to amend the United States Constitution to protect victims' rights in trial. Though the constitutional amendment ultimately failed, Senators Kyl and Feinstein authored the 2004 Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila Lynn Crime Victims' Rights Act, which listed a victims' bill of rights and provided mandamus relief in appellate court for any victim denied those rights. The act also offered sanctions against government officials who wantonly and willfully refused to comply with the Crime Victims' Rights Act. Both Senators Kyl and Feinstein described their collaboration as a high point of bi-partisan collaboration in their careers. In front of the Senate, Senator Kyl said, [...] "This legislation would not be before us today without Senator Feinstein. That is simply a fact. For all of the hard work <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> in with her cooperation and her commitment to this, I thank Senator Feinstein deeply. She knows that bond of trust will continue to exist between us." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first half}} of the [...] "Hanc igitur" [...] must now be {{accounted}} for down to [...] "placatus accipias". This first half is a reduplication of the prayer [...] "Quam oblationem". Both contain exactly the same idea that God may graciously accept our offering. [...] "Hanc oblationem" [...] and [...] "Quam oblationem" [...] differ only in the relative construction of the second form. We know that the relative construction is not the original one. In the [...] "De Sacramentis", to which reference has several times been made, the [...] "Quam oblationem" [...] occurs as an absolute sentence: [...] "Fac nobis hanc oblationem adscriptam, rationabilem acceptabilemque, quod est figura corporis et sanguinis Domini nostri Iesu Christi" [...] (IV, v). We also know that the [...] "Igitur" [...] in [...] "Hanc igitur" [...] is not original. The parallel passages in Serapion and St. Mark's Liturgy have simply tauter ten thysian (Drews, 16). Moreover, the place and object of this prayer have varied very much. It has been applied to all sorts of purposes, and it is significant that it occurs specially often in connection with the dead (Ebner, Miss. Rom., 412). This would be a natural result, if we suppose it to be a compilation of two separate parts, both of which have lost their natural place in the Canon. Drews then proposes to supply the first words of the [...] "Quam oblationem" [...] that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>put</b> in the first place of his reconstructed Canon (see above), by the {{first half of}} the [...] "Hanc igitur", so that (leaving out the igitur) the Canon would once have begun: [...] "Hanc oblationem servitutis nostræ, sed et cunctæ familiæ tuæ, quæsumus Domine, ut placatus accipias ut in omnibus benedictam, adscriptam, ratam, rationabilemque facere digneris, ut nobis corpus et sanguis fiat dilectissimi filii tui Domini nostri Iesu Christi" [...] (Drews, 30), and so on, according to the order suggested above. One word, [...] "ut", has been added to this compilation, to connect the [...] "Hanc igitur" [...] with the continuation of [...] "Quam oblationem". This word is vouched for by the Greek version, which has ina here (Swainson, 197). Drews further notes that such a change in the arrangement of the Canon is not inconceivable. Popes have modified its order on other occasions. Joannes Diaconus, the biographer of St. Gregory I, tells us that he re-arranged a few parts of the Canon ("pauca convertens", Vita Greg., II, xvii).|$|E
