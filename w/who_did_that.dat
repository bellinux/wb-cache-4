500|$|Flight attendants Lisa E. Wick and Lonnie Trumbull, both 20, were bludgeoned with a {{piece of}} lumber as they slept in their {{basement}} apartment in Seattle's Queen Anne Hill district on June 23, 1966 near the Safeway store where Bundy worked at the time, and where the women regularly shopped. Trumbull died. In retrospect, Keppel noted many similarities to the Chi Omega crime scene. Wick, who suffered permanent memory loss {{as a result of the}} attack, later contacted Ann Rule: [...] "I know that it was Ted Bundy <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> to us," [...] she wrote, [...] "but I can't tell you how I know." [...] In the absence of incriminating evidence, Bundy's involvement remains speculative.|$|E

However, in an August interview with Pitchfork, Baauer {{said that he has}} not made any money from the song, despite Diplo's reported agreement: [...] "I'm meeting with my lawyer ... so I'm gonna find that out. I think it's mostly because of all the legal shit. I didn’t clear the samples because I was in my fucking bedroom on Grand Street. I wasn't going to think to call up , I didn’t even know who it was <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> I knew the Jayson Musson [...] So I found myself in that fucking pickle. Legal letters and shit. Ugh. Lawyers. So exposure-wise it was fantastic, but everything else..." ...|$|E
500|$|Saul Steinberg created 85 {{covers and}} 642 {{internal}} drawings and illustrations for The New Yorker, including its March 29, 1976 cover, titled [...] "View of the World from 9th Avenue". This {{is regarded as}} his most famous work. It is considered an example of unintentional fame: Steinberg has noted {{that the type of}} fame that resulted from the work has diminished his significance to [...] "the man <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> poster". The work is sometimes referred to as A Parochial New Yorker's View of the World or A New Yorker's View of the World because it depicts a map of the world as seen by self-absorbed New Yorkers. At one point The New Yorker applied for a copyright from the United States Copyright Office for the work. It assigned the copyright to Steinberg and subsequently reproduced posters of the painting.|$|E

500|$|In March 1643, Temple had {{returned}} to Sussex, and along with his stepbrother, John Busbridge, he was appointed by Parliament to the Sussex committee set for the sequestration (i.e. seizure and administration) of the assets of prominent Royalists. In December 1643, Temple was prominent in the defence of the crossing of the River Adur at Bramber Castle against a Royalist attack during Lord Hopton's attempt to obtain control of Sussex for the King. His actions were described by Dr Cheynell: [...] "Upon the 12th of December I visited a brave soldier of my acquaintance, Captn Jas Temple, <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> day defend the fort of Bramber against a bold and daring enemy to the wonder of all the country and I did not marvel at it, for {{he is a man}} that hath his head full of stratagems, his heart full of piety and valour, and his hand as full of success as it is of dexterity." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{production}} team used new technology called a [...] "breakway windshield," [...] {{as well as}} air cannons to eject the stuntwoman, Melissa Stubbs, from the vehicle. Instead of using wires, they used pneumatic rams to push her; cables and pulleys made it similar to a [...] "catapult". The stuntwoman rehearsed with a helmet on, but took it off when the scene {{was ready to be}} shot. She wore a small backpad, a mouthguard, and some kneepads, and used her elbows to break the windshield upon being ejected. Stubbs commented that shooting the scene [...] "all went as planned, and was very anticlimactic" [...] {{because of the lack of}} problems. Anna Torv later called the stunt [...] "one of the most humbling experiences in my life". She elaborated, [...] "I don’t do any of the stuff that’s dangerous... Melissa Stubbs is the fantastic stuntwoman <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> [...] They put a rocket for her in the back of the car, and they had that breakaway glass for the windshield. She has nothing on extra, except maybe elbow pads. Then they shoot her out of this rocket, through the windshield, and she rolls on the ground and lands on her mark. The guy goes in. She's OK. Everybody claps. Then I have to go in, lay in the same position, so they can get a close-up of my eyes opening. That was kind of humbling." ...|$|E

What I am absolutely certain of is that Robert McConnell, Robert McConnell knew that area really, really well. Robin Jackson was with him. I was later told that Nairac was with them. I was told by ... a UVF man, he was very close to Jackson and operated with him. Jackson told [...] that Nairac was with them".|$|E

2500|$|In circles {{concerned}} with copyright and intellectual property issues, Wood {{is known as}} the artist of the unsigned satirical Disneyland Memorial Orgy poster, which first appeared in Paul Krassner's magazine The Realist. The poster depicts a number of copyrighted Disney characters in various unsavory activities (including sex acts and drug use), with huge dollar signs radiating from Cinderella's Castle. Wood himself, as late as 1981, when asked <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> drawing, said only, [...] "I'd rather not say anything about that! It was the most pirated drawing in history! Everyone was printing copies of that. I understand some people got busted for selling it. I always thought Disney stuff was pretty sexy... Snow White, etc." [...] Disney took no legal action against either Krassner or The Realist but did sue a publisher of a [...] "blacklight" [...] version of the poster, who used the image without Krassner's permission. The case was settled out of court.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2001, Giuliani's {{attorney}} {{revealed that}} Giuliani was impotent due to prostate cancer treatments {{and had not}} had sex with Nathan for the preceding year. [...] "You don't get through treatment for cancer and radiation all by yourself", Giuliani said. [...] "You need people to help you and care for you and support you. And I'm very fortunate I {{had a lot of}} people <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>that,</b> but nobody did more to help me than Judith Nathan." [...] Giuliani argued in a court case that he aimed to introduce Nathan to his children on Father's Day 2001, and that Hanover had prevented this visit. Giuliani and Hanover finally settled their divorce case in July 2002 after his mayoralty had ended, with Giuliani paying Hanover a $6.8 million settlement and granting her custody of their children. Giuliani married Nathan on May 24, 2003, and gained a stepdaughter, Whitney. It was also Nathan's third marriage after two divorces.|$|E
2500|$|McConnell {{is named}} by Weir {{to have been}} {{involved}} in a gun and bomb attack against a pub in Crossmaglen in November 1974, resulting in the fatal injury of Thomas McNamee. Weir also alleged {{that he was one of}} the accomplices in the killing of high-ranking IRA member John Francis Green outside Castleblaney in the Irish Republic on 10 January 1975. Green was shot six times in the head at close range by a group of gunmen who had burst through the front door of the [...] "safe" [...] house where he was staying; the UVF later claimed responsibility for the attack in the June 1975 edition of their journal Combat. Weir claimed that Robert Nairac also took part in Green's shooting with the following statement:"The men <b>who</b> <b>did</b> <b>that</b> shooting were Robert McConnell, Robin Jackson, and I would be almost certain, Harris Boyle who was killed in the Miami attack. What I am absolutely certain of is that Robert McConnell, Robert McConnell knew that area really, really well. Robin Jackson was with him. I was later told that Nairac was with them.
