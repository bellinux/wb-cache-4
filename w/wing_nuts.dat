25|$|In August {{the balloon}} was {{commissioned}} to fly despite known technical flaws. The commissioners {{emphasized that the}} crew, although equipped with personal parachutes, had few chances of bailing out in case of emergency: the sole airtight hatch was held in place with twelve <b>wing</b> <b>nuts.</b> Opening it, even on solid ground, required minutes. The crew did not wear pressure suits (they simply did not exist at that time) or individual breathing sets, relying on stored supplies of compressed oxygen and carbon dioxide absorber cartridges. Crew survival depended on the gondola's integrity; bailing out without breathing sets was feasible only at altitudes below 8,000 metres.|$|E
2500|$|The corselet, {{also known}} as a breastplate, is an oval or {{rectangular}} collar-piece resting on the shoulders, chest and back, to support the helmet and seal it to the suit, usually made from copper and brass, but occasionally steel. The helmet is usually connected to the suit by placing the holes around the rubberised collar of the suit over bolts along the rim of the corselet, and then clamping the brass straps known as brailes against the collar with <b>wing</b> <b>nuts</b> to press the rubber against the metal of the corselet rim to make a [...] water-tight seal. An alternative method was to bolt the bonnet to the corselet over a rubber collar bonded {{to the top of the}} suit.|$|E

5000|$|A [...] "boss" [...] {{ground joint}} {{coupling}} valve hose coupling, primarily used for compressed air or steam. It {{consists of a}} stem, <b>wing</b> <b>nut</b> and spud. It seals as a soft copper seat located in the spud is drawn against the stem by tightening the <b>wing</b> <b>nut.</b>|$|R

2500|$|... 2. The wider <b>wing</b> <b>nut</b> {{that sits}} {{underneath}} the center screw controls {{the placement of}} the lamp within the reflector. [...] Loosening this <b>wing</b> <b>nut</b> will free the lamp assembly from the cap housing. [...] The user can then push the entire adjustment screw and lamp holder up, down, left or right to center the hot spot in the beam. [...] It is this adjustment that most commonly needs to be made with lights that haven't been regularly serviced. [...] Sometimes it is helpful to use a screwdriver or wrench or other thin tool to reach between the body of the light and the cap to push up on the lamp holder assembly and hold it in place while you tighten the <b>wing</b> <b>nut</b> back down.|$|R
50|$|The {{clutch pedal}} is {{adjustable}} for travel {{and the front}} seat can be adjusted over a range of six inches using <b>wing</b> <b>nuts</b> in the cushion.|$|E
5000|$|The late 20s {{and early}} 30s were {{an era of}} {{transition}} in relation to bicycle equipment and race conditions. Areas of controversy were the use of variable gears and two sprocket wheels, single tyres, the use of butterfly or <b>wing</b> <b>nuts</b> [...] {{and the provision of}} outside assistance. The Dunlop Grand Prix permitted variable gears but prohibited butterfly or <b>wing</b> <b>nuts</b> and singles. The riders were required to repair their own bikes during the stage, were not able to change bicycles unless it was bona fide damaged [...] and no spare parts or other assistance were permitted. Similarly the riders were not permitted to accept food or drink other than from officials at feeding stations or procured by rider from established store, hotel or refreshment room.|$|E
50|$|The {{body was}} very light weight rattle free fabric {{bodywork}} built by Rover under licence from Weymann. For the driver's comfort the clutch pedal is adjustable for travel {{and the front}} seat can be adjusted over a range of six inches using <b>wing</b> <b>nuts</b> in the cushion.|$|E
2500|$|Before 1960, sports/racing cars {{usually had}} Rudge-Whitworth wire wheels center-locking {{equipped}} with splined hubs and a quick-release [...] "knockoff" [...] (central <b>wing</b> <b>nut)</b> locking cap ...|$|R
50|$|Scribe-compasses is an {{instrument}} used by carpenters and other tradesmen. Some compasses {{can be used}} to scribe circles, bisect angles and in this case to trace a line. It is the compass in the most simple form. Both branches are crimped metal. One branch has a pencil sleeve while the other branch is crimped with a fine point protruding from the end. The <b>wing</b> <b>nut</b> serves two purposes, first it tightens the pencil and secondly it locks in the desired distance when the <b>wing</b> <b>nut</b> is turned clockwise.|$|R
5000|$|A wingnut or <b>wing</b> <b>nut</b> {{is a type}} of nut {{with two}} large metal [...] "wings", one on each side, so it can be easily {{tightened}} and loosened by hand without tools.|$|R
50|$|The field averages 21 {{operations}} a month, 100% single-engine, rotorcraft and ultra-light aircraft. Flying Dollar {{is particularly}} popular with powered parachutes and light sport aircraft, several of which form a local consortium called The <b>Wing</b> <b>Nuts,</b> who {{are based on}} the field and arrange biannual fly-ins.|$|E
50|$|The blade {{is usually}} clamped into {{position}} using {{a pair of}} wingnuts. Although <b>wing</b> <b>nuts</b> are usually intended for operation without tools it is often impossible to apply sufficient force purely by hand. Wingnut spanners (US English: wrenches) greatly increase the torque that may be applied, ensuring that the blade is securely clamped.|$|E
5000|$|In one email, Neera Tanden {{stated that}} [...] "Israel is depressing. It's a good lesson that the <b>wing</b> <b>nuts</b> are just {{ruthless}} in every country." [...] In another, she lamented Hillary Clinton's [...] "suboptimal instincts". Tanden {{has called the}} release of her personal communications, which often feature her blunt private assessments, a painful experience to endure.|$|E
5000|$|By use of {{a double}} stand that mounts the top cymbal on an {{extension}} of the stand that replaces the <b>wing</b> <b>nut</b> holding the bottom cymbal. These are commercially available but more often created by adding an accessory to a single stand.|$|R
5000|$|Before 1960, sports/racing cars {{usually had}} Rudge-Whitworth wire wheels center-locking {{equipped}} with splined hubs and a quick-release [...] "knockoff" [...] (central <b>wing</b> <b>nut)</b> locking cap {{that could be}} unscrewed by striking a <b>wing</b> of the <b>nut</b> with a special alloy mallet or [...] "knockoff hammer". Some jurisdictions, including West Germany, prohibited eared hubcaps. Some manufacturers (e.g. Maserati) preferred to hold the wheel on the splined hub by capping with a single conventional unwinged nut requiring a special large spanner.|$|R
50|$|A sliding T bevel, {{also known}} as a bevel gauge or false square is an {{adjustable}} gauge for setting and transferring angles. The handle is usually made of wood or plastic and is connected to a metal blade with a thumbscrew or <b>wing</b> <b>nut.</b> The blade pivots and can be locked at any angle by loosening or tightening the thumbscrew.The bevel can be used to duplicate an existing angle, or set to a desired angle by using it with any number of other measuring tools (such as a protractor, or framing square).|$|R
50|$|Modern OC1 hulls and amas are {{commonly}} made from glass-reinforced plastic, carbon fiber reinforced plastic, and/or Kevlar {{to produce a}} strong but light canoe. OC1 are often made with rudders operated by foot pedals. More traditional designs do not have rudders. OC1 commonly use iako made of aluminium, with a mechanism for quickly assembling and disassembling the canoe (snap buttons, large <b>wing</b> <b>nuts,</b> etc.).|$|E
50|$|Knutsen started {{building}} Hawaiian steel guitars {{as early as}} 1908. Most of the guitars produced by Knutsen have spruce tops, all have lateral or diagonal bracing on the back, also due to his eccentric building skills many of his guitars used some crude solutions such as: wide number of screws, brackets, <b>wing</b> <b>nuts,</b> sheared-off tuning machine plates, odd-shaped nuts and dressmaker's seam tape rather than wood strips to reinforce ribs and butt fitted back plates.|$|E
5000|$|The MON-100 {{mine body}} has a smooth, well {{finished}} appearance with a webbing handle {{mounted on the}} upper edge, it is usually attached to a mounting shackle by <b>wing</b> <b>nuts</b> {{on either side of}} the mine body (the shackle is connected to a spike for securing the mine to buildings, trees etc.). The concave face of the mine has a detonator cavity in its center (this is the side aimed at the target).|$|E
5000|$|Screw You: Played in two-player pairs, {{teams have}} to advance each player through {{a pair of}} {{obstacle}} courses and unscrew an oversize <b>wing</b> <b>nut</b> {{at the end of}} the first two obstacles. Once each pair advances to a stairway at the third obstacle, the next pair repeats the process, and the process continues until each pair crosses the finish line. (Note: Since the Rookies were short one male player, one guy has to go through the obstacle course twice.) The first team to advance all of their players through the obstacle course wins.|$|R
2500|$|On the Leeds and Liverpool Canal {{there is}} a variety of {{different}} lock gear. Some paddles are raised by turning what is in effect a large horizontal <b>wing</b> <b>nut</b> (butterfly nut) lifting a screw-threaded bar attached {{to the top of the}} paddle. Others are operated by lifting a long wooden lever, which operates a wooden plate which seals the culvert. These are known locally as [...] "jack cloughs". Bottom gate paddles are sometimes operated by a horizontal ratchet which also slides a wooden plate sideways, rather than the more common vertical lift. Many of these idiosyncratic paddles have been [...] "modernised" [...] and they are becoming rare.|$|R

In the article particular {{attention is paid to}} some catachreses of mechanical language (in particular catachreses existing within the terminology of the anchor) and of medical language, where an anatomic term, referring to a part of the human body, e. g. collo, neck, can indicate a part of an other organ: collo della vescica, cervix of the bladder...|$|R
50|$|The risk of firemen {{tying down}} the safety valve remained. This was {{encouraged}} by them being fitted with easily adjustable <b>wing</b> <b>nuts,</b> the practice of adjusting the boiler's working pressure via the safety valve being an accepted behaviour well into the 1850s. It was later common with Salter valves {{for them to be}} fitted in pairs, one adjustable and often calibrated for use as a gauge, the other sealed inside a locked cover to prevent tampering.|$|E
50|$|The storage/floor sections, each 1.2 by 2.4 m {{were made}} from plywood and {{insulated}} with R-7 fiberglass insulation, which provided a portable, warm and cleanable floor. The wooden arches holding up the roof were attached to the floor sections with steel fittings and <b>wing</b> <b>nuts,</b> and were strong {{enough to hold a}} winter’s snow. The arches, the key to the design, were curved, glue-laminated wooden 15 cm beams on 1.2 m centers that folded in quarters on steel hinges and removable pins.|$|E

30|$|Tilting {{mechanism}} The {{purpose of}} the tilting mechanism {{is to increase the}} number of DOFs of the calibration board. It allows calibration trajectories to be in three-dimensional space. Figure  2 c, d shows the tilting mechanism. To increase the number of DOFs while retaining sufficient stiffness of the calibration table, a 3 -DOF ball joint with high stiffness was used in the tilting mechanism. The calibration board can tilt in roll and pitch directions. A <b>wing</b> <b>nut</b> on the ball joint slider is used to fix the ball joint slider and aluminum extrusion (see Fig.  2 c, d). Therefore, the calibration broad rotates in roll and pitch direction via the tilting mechanism.|$|R
5000|$|Garlasco {{has made}} it a {{personal}} objective to prevent the use of cluster munitions. He co-authored the 2006 Human Rights Watch report condemning Israel’s use of such weapons in Lebanon and a report in 2008 documenting how civilians living in South Ossetia suffered the use of cluster munitions by both the Russian and Georgian armies. Colin Kahl, a professor of security studies at Georgetown University, said that Garlasco [...] "knows more about airstrikes {{than anyone in the}} world who isn't in the military currently", adding that [...] "when Marc says stuff is messed up, the military has to take it seriously. It's not some <b>wing</b> <b>nut</b> in a human rights group out to get the military".|$|R
50|$|A scroll frame or {{embroidery}} frame keeps the entire piece of fabric taut, {{rather than just}} the piece being worked. It is made of four pieces of wood: two rollers for the top and base, and two side pieces. Each of the rollers has a piece of fabric securely nailed or stapled along it and holes in its ends to hold the side pieces, which can be secured in place with <b>wing</b> <b>nuts</b> to adjust {{the width of the}} frame and the tautness of the stretched fabric. The ends of the ground fabric are sewn to the rollers, which are turned until the area of the fabric to be worked is stretched within the frame.|$|E
50|$|This British WWII Airborne BSA {{folding bicycle}} was rigged so that, when parachuted, the {{handlebars}} and seat {{were the first}} parts to hit the ground (as bent wheels would disable the bike). BSA abandoned the traditional diamond bicycle design as too weak for the shock and instead made an elliptical frame of twin parallel tubes, one forming the top tube and seat stays, and the other the chainstay and down tube. The hinges were {{in front of the}} bottom bracket and in the corresponding position in front of the saddle, fastened by <b>wing</b> <b>nuts.</b> The peg pedals could be pushed in to avoid snagging and further reduce the space occupied during transit.|$|E

5000|$|Plant and fossils {{found with}} the remains show that M. meridionalis {{was living in}} a time of mild climate, {{generally}} as warm or slightly warmer than Europe experiences today. Deciduous mixed wood provided its habitat and food, which consisted mostly of tree-browse: oak, ash, beech and other familiar European trees, as well as some that are now exotic to the region, such as hemlock, <b>wing</b> <b>nut</b> and hickory. Complete skeletons are in Stavropol State Museum in Russia, and in L'Aquila National Museum in Italy. Further east, discoveries at Ubeidiya (Israel) and Dmanisi (Georgia) show the early mammoth living in a partially open habitat with grassy areas, though subsisting on scattered trees and shrubs.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} landscapes {{in this region}} are meadows, {{mountains}} and forest areas, {{with a range of}} forest and mountain soils. The area is characterized by a diverse landscape, with an area more greatly forested than other regions of Azerbaijan. Alder (Alnus sp.) Caucasian <b>wing</b> <b>nut</b> (Pterocarya pterocarpa), hybrid poplar (Populus), and long-stem oak (Quercus longipes) are dominant species of trees in flatland areas of low-lying forests. There are forests of juniper (Juniperus sp.), Turkish terebinth (Pistacia sp.) and Iberian oak (Quercus iberica) in the steppe plateau areas. The dominant flora species of the down mountain forest zone (1000 - 1100 m) are Iberian oak and eastern hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis). The middle mountain forest zone mainly consists of beech (Fagus sp.) forests. The fauna of the region is characterized by mammals such as the brown bear (Ursus arctos).|$|R
50|$|Lawyer lips or lawyer tabs (a type of {{positive}} retention device) are tabs fitted to the fork ends {{on the front}} fork of bicycles sold in some countries (particularly the U.S.) to prevent a wheel from leaving the fork if the quick release skewer comes undone. They were introduced in response to lawsuits supported by experts including John Howard, in cases where incorrectly adjusted quick release wheels {{came out of the}} forks. Lawyer tabs are designed to compensate for the fact that many riders {{do not know how to}} operate a quick release properly: some riders treat them as a folding <b>wing</b> <b>nut,</b> and others do not tighten them enough for fear of snapping them or shearing the skewer (both are not likely given the normal range of human strength, and the mechanical advantages involved, as long as the skewer is not damaged or flawed).|$|R
