5|$|During {{the storm}} of 10 July 1968, the lake gained an extra 471millionimperial gallons (2,140,000m³) and rose 19inches (480mm) in under 12hours. At one point worried Bristol police issued a <b>warning</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> dam might not hold, {{prompting}} localised evacuation of populated valley areas downstream including Pensford and Keynsham.|$|E
5|$|He led the {{planning}} for the Battle of Leyte, known as Operation King II, and predicted that the Japanese fleet would attempt to intervene, striking at the invasion force through the Surigao Strait. His <b>warning</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Japanese fleet would sortie was discounted by MacArthur's chief intelligence officer, Brigadier General Charles A. Willoughby, but Tarbuck put his objection in writing. MacArthur would later commend him for an accurate prediction of {{the course of the}} Battle of Leyte Gulf.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus also recounts that King Alexander I of Macedonia (an {{ancestor}} of Alexander the Great,) who was allied to the Persians and present in their camp, secretly rode to the Greek camp with a <b>warning</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Persians {{had decided to}} attack, and that before the main battle Mardonius issued {{a challenge to the}} Spartans to fight a special battle between equal numbers of Spartans and Persians, which was declined. Some historians have called these stories improbable.|$|E

50|$|He {{introduced}} {{many new}} rules for members and notices were placed {{around the town}} with stern <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> independents (who didn't belong to the church) resented and often burned. But the city was established as a safe space for those within its boundaries.|$|R
50|$|Payment pageThis {{was a set}} of a {{few pages}} whereby, after several <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> payment is real, the user could fill out a form to donate {{for a range of}} amount options from $10 to $10000, and which later changed to $20, $200 or $2000.|$|R
5|$|Aposematism is {{a widely}} used {{function}} of bioluminescence, providing a <b>warning</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> creature concerned is unpalatable. It is suggested that many firefly larvae glow to repel predators; millipedes glow for the same purpose. Some marine organisms are believed to emit light for a similar reason. These include scale worms, jellyfish and brittle stars but {{further research is needed}} to fully establish the function of the luminescence. Such a mechanism would be of particular advantage to soft-bodied cnidarians if they were able to deter predation in this way. The limpet Latia neritoides is the only known freshwater gastropod that emits light. It produces greenish luminescent mucus which may have an anti-predator function. The marine snail Hinea brasiliana uses flashes of light, probably to deter predators. The blue-green light is emitted through the translucent shell, which functions as an efficient diffuser of light.|$|E
5|$|August 1945 {{began with}} further {{large-scale}} raids against Japanese cities. On the 1st of the month, 836 B-29s staged {{the largest single}} raid of World War II, dropping 6,145 tons of bombs and mines. The cities of Hachiōji, Mito, Nagaoka and Toyama were the main targets of this operation; all four suffered extensive damage and 99.5 percent of buildings in Toyama were destroyed. The cities of Imabari, Maebashi, Nishinomiya and Saga were attacked on 5August. These raids had also been preceded by propaganda leaflets and radio broadcasts from Saipan <b>warning</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> cities would be attacked.|$|E
5|$|For {{security}} reasons, Groves wanted H. K. Ferguson {{to operate}} the new plant, {{but it was a}} closed shop, and security regulations at the Clinton Engineer Works did not allow trade unions. To get around this, H. K. Ferguson created a wholly owned subsidiary, the Fercleve Corporation (from Ferguson of Cleveland), and the Manhattan District contracted it {{to operate the}} plant for $11,000 a month. Operating personnel for the new plant were initially trained at the Philadelphia pilot plant. In August 1944, Groves, Conant and Fox asked ten enlisted men of the Special Engineer Detachment (SED) at Oak Ridge for volunteers, <b>warning</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> job would be dangerous. All ten volunteered. Along with four Fercleve employees, they were sent to Philadelphia to learn about the plant's operation.|$|E
5|$|The small {{particles}} in the smoke contained hydrocarbons, which can be an irritant but have a low toxicity and were not expected to cause any long-term harm. The Met Office issued <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> smoke in the atmosphere could come down in rainfall during the night of 11 December.|$|R
2500|$|As {{part of his}} {{defensive}} measures, {{he named}} the French Santiago de Liniers commander of the port of Ensenada de Barragán, about [...] south of Buenos Aires, with orderds to rotect the coast.

50|$|After a sneak {{off from}} the group, Norman decides to cook {{sausages}} that he brought earlier to the forest (ignoring <b>the</b> <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> forest is too dry to start fires) and sets fire to old wood using a sharp wood pin. Dilys finds them but fails to notice the fire.|$|R
5|$|The {{developing}} stalemate saw {{activity on}} both sides of the bay. Among the French fleet there was dissatisfaction that Willaumez had not attacked Stopford when he enjoyed numerical superiority, taking the opportunity to break out of the anchorage and pursue his objectives in the Caribbean. Captain Jacques Bergeret was so incensed that he wrote a letter criticising Willaumez to the Minister of Marine Denis Decrès, and <b>warning</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Aix Roads were highly vulnerable to British attack. Although Emperor Napoleon apparently shared Willaumez's opinion, Decrès removed and censured both Willaumez and Bergeret, replacing the admiral with Zacharie Allemand on 16 March. Word had arrived that a British expeditionary force had captured Martinique in late February, and so Allemand, lacking further instructions, prepared his defences.|$|E
5|$|Word of Merrimacks {{reconstruction}} and conversion was confirmed in the North in late February 1862 when Mary Louveste of Norfolk, a freed slave {{who worked as}} a housekeeper for one of the Confederate engineers working on Merrimack, made her way through Confederate lines with news that the Confederates were building an ironclad warship. Concealed in her dress was a message from a Union sympathizer who worked in the Navy Yard <b>warning</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> former Merrimack, renamed Virginia by the Confederates, was nearing completion. Upon her arrival in Washington Mary managed to meet with Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles and informed him that the Confederates were nearing the completion of their ironclad, which surprised Welles. Convinced by the papers Mary was carrying he had production of Monitor sped up. Welles later recorded in his memoirs that Mrs. Louveste encountered no small risk in bringing this information...|$|E
5|$|Controversies {{regarding}} the siting of the Green Line continued. In May 1980, {{a group of}} business owners near the former proposed terminus at Branch Avenue and Auth Road near Marlow Heights sued Metro {{on the grounds that}} the decision to change the course of the Green Line was illegal because it had been undertaken without a public hearing (in violation of Metro's rules). In February 1981, Judge Norman Park Ramsey of the U.S. District for Maryland held that Metro did not correctly advertise the hearings at which the change would be discussed. Metro appealed the ruling, and Judge Ramsey did not enjoin Metro from proceeding with construction until the appeal was resolved. The Prince George's County government, however, reaffirmed in April 1981 its support for the Rosecroft Raceway terminus, and Metro promised to hold a public hearing on the issue in June 1981. Shortly thereafter, the civil rights office in the U.S. Department of Transportation sent a letter to Metro <b>warning</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Rosecroft Raceway route could negatively impact two historically black communities nearby. In May 1981, Metro changed its estimate for the opening of the Green Line to Anacostia to early 1988.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, {{he led a}} team {{of reporters}} in an award-winning series on {{the rise of the}} global AIDS {{pandemic}} and the failure of governments, pharmaceutical companies and the World Health Organization to act on clear <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> disease was on a path to killing tens of millions of people.|$|R

50|$|As {{part of his}} {{defensive}} measures, {{he named}} the French Santiago de Liniers commander of the port of Ensenada de Barragán, about 70 km south of Buenos Aires, with orderds to rotect the coast. Liniers sent him several <b>warnings</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> British had been seen exploring {{the coast of the}} River Plate.|$|R
5|$|Player {{controls}} include clockwise and counterclockwise rotation, forward thrust, firing torpedoes, and hyperspace. Initially {{these were}} controlled using the front-panel test {{switches on the}} PDP-1 minicomputer, with four switches for each player, but these proved to be awkward to use and wore out quickly under normal gameplay, as well as causing players to accidentally flip the computer's control and power switches. The location of the switches also left one player {{off to one side}} of the CRT display due to the limited space in front of the computer, which left them at a disadvantage. To alleviate these problems, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad. The gamepad had a switch for turning left or right, another for forward thrust or hyperspace, and a torpedo launch button. The button was silent so that the opposing player would not have a <b>warning</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> player was attempting to fire a torpedo during a cooldown period.|$|E
25|$|In April 2005, Tang Yong of the People's Daily of China covered LaRouche's {{record of}} {{economic}} forecasting, and his <b>warning</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> present financial and currency system was already unsalvageable, thus {{it must be}} radically restructured, not just merely reformed.|$|E
