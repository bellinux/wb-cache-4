25|$|Critics {{argue that}} Fairtrade harms all non-Fairtrade farmers. Fairtrade claims that its farmers are paid higher prices and are given special advice on {{increasing}} yields and quality. Economists state that, {{if this is}} indeed so, Fairtrade farmers will increase production. As the demand for coffee is highly elastic, a small increase in supply means a large fall in market price, so perhaps a million Fairtrade farmers get a higher price and 24 million others get a substantially lower price. Critics quote the example of farmers in Vietnam being paid over the world price in the 1980s, planting lots of coffee, then flooding the world market in the 1990s. The Fairtrade minimum price means that when the <b>world</b> <b>market</b> <b>price</b> collapses, it is the non-Fairtrade farmers, particularly the poorest, who have to cut down their coffee trees. This argument is supported by mainstream economists, not just free marketers.|$|E
2500|$|Governments {{with strong}} tendencies towards {{kleptocracy}} can undermine food security even when harvests are good. When government monopolizes trade, farmers {{may find that}} {{they are free to}} grow cash crops for export, but under penalty of law only able to sell their crops to government buyers at prices far below the <b>world</b> <b>market</b> <b>price.</b> The government then is free to sell their crop on the world market at full price, pocketing the difference. This creates an artificial [...] "poverty trap" [...] from which even the most hard working and motivated farmers may not escape.|$|E
50|$|A {{variable}} {{import levy}} is a levy on imports that raises their price {{to a level}} at least {{as high as the}} domestic price. Such levies are adjusted frequently (hence variable) in response to changes in <b>world</b> <b>market</b> <b>prices,</b> and are imposed to defend administered <b>prices</b> set above <b>world</b> <b>market</b> <b>prices.</b> Under the Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture, the variable levies of the EU have been converted into fixed tariffs or tariff-rate quotas.|$|R

50|$|The 1971 Comprehensive Program {{also called}} for {{improvement}} in the Comecon system of foreign trade prices. Administratively set prices, such as those used in intra-Comecon trade, did not reflect costs or relative scarcities of inputs and outputs. For this reason, intra-comecon trade {{has been based on}} <b>world</b> <b>market</b> <b>prices.</b> By 1971 a price system governing exchanges among members had developed, under which prices agreed on through negotiation were fixed for five-year periods (corresponding to those of the synchronized, five-year plans of the members). These contract prices were based on adjusted <b>world</b> <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> averaged over the immediately preceding five years; that is, a world-price base was used as the starting point for negotiation. Under this system, therefore, intra-Comecon prices could and did depart substantially from relative <b>prices</b> on <b>world</b> <b>markets.</b>|$|R

40|$|Recent global food price {{developments}} have spurred {{renewed interest in}} analyzing integration of local markets to global markets. A popular approach to quantify market integration is cointegration analysis. However, local <b>market</b> <b>price</b> data often has missing values, outliers, or short and incomplete series, making cointegration analysis impossible. Instead of imputing missing data, this paper proposes cluster analysis as an alternative methodological approach for analyzing market integration. We perform cluster analyses on statistical indicators of eight Ethiopian local price series to analyze how they relate to <b>world</b> <b>market</b> <b>prices.</b> Moreover, recognizing several policy regimes in the period 2007 - 2010 we investigate how market clusters change over time. Results show that in periods with wheat imports via the private sector, several local markets are clustered with the <b>world</b> <b>market.</b> In periods with government controlled imports and exchange rate collapse, the characteristics of domestic prices were strongly dissimilar from those of <b>world</b> <b>market</b> <b>prices...</b>|$|R

50|$|Tin {{has been}} mined in the Uis region since 1922. Uis Tin Mining Company was {{established}} in 1951 and the settlement {{was established in}} 1958 as a mine workers' residence when ISCOR, a South African mining company, started operations there and increased production. However, the ore grade at Uis is very low, and successful production is thus dependent on a high <b>world</b> <b>market</b> <b>price.</b> The white mine spoils are still visible from afar.|$|E
50|$|The Hungarian and Dutch gold ducats, minted {{for centuries}} with a stable fineness, were esteemed trade coins. Other trade coins were the {{so-called}} silver Trade dollars used by Mexico and the USA to buy South American or Chinese goods relatively cheaply.

Between 2004 and 2009, Cafédirect paid more than £7.5 million above the market price to growers (including Fairtrade premiums), invested over £3 million in tailor-made programmes to strengthen growers’ businesses, which represents more than 50% of the company's profits and in total, paid more than £10.5 million towards the businesses and communities of their grower partners.|$|E
25|$|According to {{researchers}} John F. Morton and T. Roberts, disproportionate vulnerability to climate disasters is socially determined. For example, socioeconomic and policy trends affecting smallholder and subsistence farmers limit {{their capacity to}} adapt to change. According to W. Baethgen who studied the vulnerability of Latin American agriculture to climate change, a history of policies and economic dynamics has negatively impacted rural farmers. During the 1950s and through the 1980s, high inflation and appreciated real exchange rates reduced the value of agricultural exports. As a result, farmers in Latin America received lower prices for their products compared to <b>world</b> <b>market</b> <b>prices.</b> Following these outcomes, Latin American policies and national crop programs aimed to stimulate agricultural intensification. These national crop programs benefitted larger commercial farmers more. In the 1980s and 1990s low <b>world</b> <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> for cereals and livestock resulted in decreased agricultural growth and increased rural poverty.|$|R
50|$|Trade between CMEA {{member states}} {{was divided into}} ‘hard’ goods and ‘soft’ goods. The former could be sold on <b>world</b> <b>markets</b> and the latter could not. Commodities such as food, energy {{products}} and raw materials tended to be ‘hard’ goods and were traded within the CMEA area at <b>world</b> <b>market</b> <b>prices.</b> Manufactures tended to be ‘soft’ goods and their prices were negotiable and often adjusted to make bilateral payment flows balance.|$|R
50|$|Between 1960 and 1966, {{manganese}} {{mines in}} the region of Grand-Lahou on the coast yielded 180,000 tons of ore per year. In 1970, after <b>world</b> <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> had dropped and production costs had risen, the mines were closed. There were additional unexploited managanese deposits near Odienné. Ivory Coast also had small deposits of colombo-tantalite, ilmenite, cobalt, copper, nickel, and bauxite.|$|R
50|$|Over-quota sugar {{entering}} {{from countries}} other than Mexico {{continues to be}} subject to a much higher tariff, and is not subject to a treaty or statutory decline in tariff as was Mexican sugar. The tariff is set under the treaty agreements embodied in the United States participation in the World Trade Organization. This second-tier tariff is in effect a prohibitive tariff. When added to the <b>world</b> <b>market</b> <b>price</b> for sugar, it makes world sugar uncompetitive in cost, and serves to keep it from entering the U.S. market.|$|E
50|$|While {{there was}} no {{physical}} shortage of rice, increasing prices created a panic that supplies could not match demand. This fear was lessened when the United States allowed Japan to export unsold American rice (stockpiled in Japan because of a World Trade Organization decision). As of 16 May, anticipation of the move had already lowered prices by 14% in a single week. Although the rice from Japan was never actually sold or shipped, the <b>world</b> <b>market</b> <b>price</b> continued to fall every month of 2008 thereafter.|$|E
