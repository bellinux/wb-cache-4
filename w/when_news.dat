5|$|Australia became {{directly}} involved when the Confederate navy visited {{in order to}} repair one of their warships. This led to protests from the Union representative at Melbourne, while the citizenry of nearby Williamstown entertained the Confederates and some Australians joined the crew. Accounts disagree as to whether Australians generally favored the Union or the Confederacy, as sorrowful demonstrations were held in Sydney <b>when</b> <b>news</b> arrived of Abraham Lincoln's assassination.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth and Mary {{were soon}} sent to Novigrad Castle, with John of Palisna as their new jailer. Margaret insisted that Elizabeth {{be put to}} death. She was tried and, after the Christmas {{adjournment}} of the proceedings, found guilty of inciting Charles' murder. Sigismund marched into Slavonia in January 1387, with the intention to reach Novigrad and rescue the queens. Towards the middle of January, <b>when</b> <b>news</b> of Sigismund's approach reached Novigrad, Elizabeth was strangled by guards before Mary's eyes.|$|E
5|$|Famously, {{the much}} smaller Greek army held the pass of Thermopylae against the Persians {{for three days}} before being outflanked by a {{mountain}} path. Much of the Greek army retreated, before the Spartans and Thespians who had continued to block the pass were surrounded and killed. The simultaneous Battle of Artemisium was {{up to that point}} a stalemate; however, <b>when</b> <b>news</b> of Thermopylae reached them, the Allied fleet also retreated, since holding the straits of Artemisium was now a moot point.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{examine the}} {{incentives}} of buy-side analysts {{to participate in}} earnings conference calls, and how their participation and proactive involvement in the call affects information production during the call. Our results suggest that avoiding large losses on stocks in the buy-side portfolios is {{a major reason for}} their participation and involvement. Buy-side participation and early involvement lead to greater information production, but the effect exists only <b>when</b> the <b>news</b> around the earnings announcement event is negative. Sell-side analysts benefit from the information production – they revise their forecasts more often and make more accurate forecasts when buy-side involvement is more; however, again, this effect is present only <b>when</b> the <b>news</b> is negative. Finally, <b>when</b> the <b>news</b> around the earnings announcement is positive, greater buy-side participation ameliorates the post-announcement drift, but <b>when</b> the <b>news</b> is negative, the drift is more pronounced when there is more buy-side involvement in the earnings conference call...|$|R

5|$|In Baghdad, {{given the}} lack of firm and public {{leadership}} by Mirza Yahya, the Babi community had fallen into disarray. Some Babis, including Bahá'u'lláh's family, began searching for Bahá'u'lláh, and <b>when</b> <b>news</b> of a man living in the mountains under the name of Darvish Muhammad spread to neighboring areas, Bahá'u'lláh's family begged him to come back to Baghdad. On 19 March 1856, after two years in Kurdistan he returned to Baghdad.|$|E
5|$|Modern historians, doubting that a Persian {{commander}} {{would have}} sabotaged his own invasion, have suggested several other possible scenarios. It is, however, {{impossible to know}} exactly how the Naxians {{became aware of the}} invasion, but undoubtedly they were aware, and began to make preparations. Herodotus tells us that the Naxians had previously had no inkling of the expedition, but that <b>when</b> <b>news</b> arrived they brought everything in from the fields, gathered enough food with which to survive a siege and reinforced their walls.|$|E

5|$|The Klondike Gold Rush was a {{migration}} by {{an estimated}} 100,000 prospectors to the Klondike {{region of the}} Yukon in north-western Canada between 1896 and 1899. Gold was discovered there by local miners on August 16, 1896, and, <b>when</b> <b>news</b> reached Seattle and San Francisco the following year, it triggered a stampede of prospectors. Some became wealthy, but the majority went in vain. It has been immortalized in photographs, books, films, and artifacts.|$|E

5|$|The {{debate over}} the {{proposed}} national constitution became moot <b>when</b> <b>news</b> of Italian troop movements in Tyrol and near the Venetian border reached Vienna in April 1866. The Austrian government ordered partial mobilization in the southern regions; the Italians responded by ordering full mobilization. Despite calls for rational thought and action, Italy, Prussia, and Austria continued to rush toward armed conflict. On 1 May, Wilhelm gave von Moltke command over the Prussian armed forces, {{and the next day}} he began full-scale mobilization.|$|E

5|$|<b>When</b> <b>news</b> {{began to}} spread of Henry I's death, many of the {{potential}} claimants to the throne were not well placed to respond. Geoffrey and Matilda were in Anjou, rather awkwardly supporting the rebels in their campaign against the royal army, which included a number of Matilda's supporters such as Robert of Gloucester. Many of these barons had taken an oath to stay in Normandy until the late king was properly buried, which prevented them from returning to England. Stephen's elder brother Theobald was further south still, in Blois. Stephen, however, was in Boulogne, and <b>when</b> <b>news</b> reached him of Henry's death he left for England, accompanied by his military household. Robert of Gloucester had garrisoned the ports of Dover and Canterbury and some accounts suggest that they refused Stephen access when he first arrived. Nonetheless Stephen probably reached his own estate {{on the edge of}} London by 8 December and over the next week he began to seize power in England.|$|E
5|$|After {{the special}} session of Congress had adjourned, Sherman {{returned}} home to Mansfield.

The assassin, Charles J. Guiteau, was a deranged office-seeker who believed that Garfield's successor would appoint him to a patronage job. After lingering for several months, Garfield died, and Arthur became president. After completing a long-planned visit to Yellowstone National Park and other Western sites with his brother William, Sherman returned to a second special session of Congress in October 1881.|$|E

Unaware that the Alamo had fallen, reinforcements continued to assemble; over 400Texians were waiting in Gonzales <b>when</b> <b>news</b> of the Texian defeat reached the town on March 11. Earlier that day, General Sam Houston, newly reappointed commander of the Texian Army, had arrived in Gonzales. On hearing of the Alamo's fall, Houston took command of the assembled volunteers. The following month, this hastily organized army defeated Santa Anna at the Battle of San Jacinto, ending the Texas Revolution.|$|E
