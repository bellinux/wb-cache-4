25|$|Curtis and Leigh {{made one}} more film {{together}} <b>Who</b> <b>Was</b> <b>That</b> Lady? (1960), a comedy with Dean Martin. He and Debbie Reynolds then {{starred in the}} romantic comedy The Rat Race (1960).|$|E
25|$|Operated as an {{independent}} cinema through its entire life, its name changed to the Coliseum Cinema around 1930 when talking films were introduced. In the late 1950s it was bought along with the Regal (Premier Electric) by the Newcastle-based Essoldo company. In 1961 Essoldo implemented plans to turn the Coliseum into a bingo hall. It closed on 3 June 1961 with a final show including Tony Curtis in <b>Who</b> <b>Was</b> <b>That</b> Lady and Randolph Scott in Buchanan Rides Alone.|$|E
25|$|Martin's {{first solo}} film, Ten Thousand Bedrooms (1957), was a box-office failure. He was still popular as a singer, but with {{rock and roll}} to the fore, {{the era of the}} pop crooner was waning. Martin wanted to become a {{dramatic}} actor, known for more than slapstick comedy films. Though offered a fraction of his former salary to co-star in a war drama, The Young Lions (1958), his part would be with Marlon Brando and Montgomery Clift. Tony Randall already had the part, but talent agency MCA realized that with this film, Martin would become a triple threat: they could make money from his work in night clubs, films, and records. Martin replaced Randall and the film {{turned out to be the}} beginning of Martin's comeback. Martin starred alongside Frank Sinatra for the first time in the Vincente Minnelli drama, Some Came Running (1958). By the mid-1960s, Martin was a movie, recording, television, and nightclub star. Martin was acclaimed as Dude in Rio Bravo (1959), directed by Howard Hawks and also starring John Wayne and singer Ricky Nelson. He teamed again with Wayne in The Sons of Katie Elder (1965), cast as brothers. In 1960, Martin was cast in the film version of the Judy Holliday stage musical comedy Bells Are Ringing. He won a Golden Globe nomination for his performance in the 1960 film comedy <b>Who</b> <b>Was</b> <b>That</b> Lady? but continued to seek dramatic roles, portraying a Southern politician in 1961's Ada, and starring in 1963's screen adaptation of an intense stage drama, Toys in the Attic, opposite Geraldine Page, as well as in 1970's drama Airport, a huge box-office success.|$|E

2500|$|The Constitutions of the Free-Masons, [...] "For the Use of the Lodges" [...] in London and Westminster, was {{published}} in 1723. It was edited by the presbyterian clergyman, James Anderson, {{to the order of}} John Theophilus Desaguliers, and approved by a Grand Lodge committee under his control. This work was reprinted in Philadelphia in 1734 by Benjamin Franklin, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> year elected Grand Master of Masons in Pennsylvania. It was also translated into Dutch (1736), German (1741), and French (1745).|$|E
2500|$|The first Langhorne National Open {{was held}} in 1951, and Dutch Hoag raced in it; {{he was one of}} the last cars to get through the large wreck which blocked the track and burned driver Wally Campbell, <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> year's NASCAR National Modified Champion. [...] The National Open was the premiere event for weekly racers; track champions and other top racers from {{everywhere}} Modified and Sportsman cars were raced, gathered at a large, fast speedway where nobody had a home-track advantage. [...] The race was renamed to the [...] "Race of Champions" [...] when it was moved to Trenton in 1972 after Langhorne Speedway was closed.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{her last}} solo {{releases}} was [...] "Heart Don't Do This to Me" [...] (1985), which reached No. 19—her last Top 20 hit. In 1993, Lynn stopped releasing singles and focused more on touring than promoting. As a concert artist, she remained a top draw throughout her career, but by the early 1990s she drastically cut down the number of personal appearances owing to the fragile health of her husband, who died in 1996. Her 1985 album Just a Woman spawned a Top 40 hit. In 1987, Lynn lent her voice to a song on k.d. lang's album Shadowland with country stars Kitty Wells and Brenda Lee, [...] "Honky Tonk Angels Medley". They released a video for this medley; the album went gold and was Grammy nominated for the four women. Lynn's 1988 album <b>Who</b> <b>Was</b> <b>That</b> Stranger would be her last solo album for a major record company as a solo artist. She {{was inducted into the}} Country Music Hall of Fame in 1988.|$|E
