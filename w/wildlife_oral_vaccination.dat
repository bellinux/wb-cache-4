The ability to successfully track, monitor, and identify animals using minimally invasive techniques is becoming increasingly important as wildlife-human interactions increase.

Once oral immunogenicity and vaccine safety have been demonstrated, efficacy then becomes of paramount importance. Classical assessment of efficacy is conducted under carefully controlled laboratory conditions, whereas efficacy of <b>oral</b> <b>wildlife</b> rabies <b>vaccination</b> programs, to date, have been assessed by the lack (or occurrence) of field cases of rabies in a vaccinated area. This communication describes an intermediate vaccine efficacy strategy in which self-vaccinated, free-ranging animals from a study site were captured seven months after vaccine-laden bait distribution for laboratory rabies challenge.

40|$|Wildlife {{biologists}} {{are increasingly}} being thrust onto the frontlines of wildlife disease management and surveillance in the United States. For example, biologists now routinely engage in <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> of <b>wildlife</b> [e-g., <b>Oral</b> Rabies <b>Vaccination</b> Programs (QRVPs) ] and collect specimens for both diagnostic purposes and disease surveillance or monitoring (e. g., avian influenza in migratory bids). For many, these responsibilities are novel compared to the more traditional roles of population estimation. habitat manipulation, and formulation of harvest recommendations. Wildlife disease investigation and management, in reality, we in their infancy compared with disciplines of human and domestic animal disease management. The recent focus wildlife diseases is attributable to (1) the emergence of zoonoses that have a clear wildlife component (c-g., Lyme disease), (2) the recognition that wildlife can serve as reservoirs for diseases important to domestic animals (e. g., pseudorabies), (3) the increase in game farming and the associated risk of disease transmission to free-living wildlife (e. g., chronic wasting disease], (4) recognition of risks associated with the translocation of wildlife, and (5) intensified management for species at risk of extinction (Wobeser 22002). Clearly, interest in wildlife diseases and their management will continue to expand as humans, livestock, and wildlife come into closer contact as a direct or indirect result of the burgeoning human population...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{perceived}} {{challenges to}} controlling an infectious disease in <b>wildlife,</b> <b>oral</b> rabies <b>vaccination</b> (ORV) of foxes has proved a remarkably successful tool and {{a prime example}} of a sophisticated strategy to eliminate disease from wildlife reservoirs. During the past three decades, the implementation of ORV programmes in 24 countries has led to the elimination of fox-mediated rabies from vast areas of Western and Central Europe. In this study, we evaluated the efficiency of 22 European ORV programmes between 1978 and 2010. During this period an area of almost 1. 9 million km² was targeted at least once with vaccine baits, with control taking between 5 and 26 years depending upon the country. We examined factors influencing effort required both to control and eliminate fox rabies as well as cost-related issues of these programmes. The proportion of land area ever affected by rabies and an index capturing the size and overlap of successive ORV campaigns were identified as factors having statistically significant effects on the number of campaigns required to both control and eliminate rabies. Repeat comprehensive campaigns that are wholly overlapping much more rapidly eliminate infection and are less costly in the long term. Disproportionally greater effort is required in the final phase of an ORV programme, with a median of 11 additional campaigns required to eliminate disease once incidence has been reduced by 90 per cent. If successive ORV campaigns span the entire affected area, rabies will be eliminated more rapidly than if campaigns are implemented in a less comprehensive manner, therefore reducing ORV expenditure in the longer term. These findings should help improve the planning and implementation of ORV programmes, and facilitate future decision-making by veterinary authorities and policy-makers...|$|R

40|$|Although nasal {{vaccination}} {{has emerged}} as an interesting alternative to systemic or <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination,</b> knowledge is scarce about the immune responses after such immunization in humans. In the present study, we have compared the kinetics and organ distribution of the antibody responses after nasal and <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination.</b> We immunized female volunteers nasally or orally with cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) and determined the specific antibody levels in serum and nasal and vaginal secretions, {{as well as the}} number of circulating antibody-secreting cells, before immunization and 1, 2, 3, 6, and 26 weeks thereafter. Nasal vaccination induced 9 -fold CTB-specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) and 56 -fold specific IgG antibody increases in nasal secretions, whereas no significant IgA increase was seen after <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination.</b> Both <b>oral</b> and nasal <b>vaccination</b> resulted in 5 - to 6 -fold CTB-specific IgA and 20 - to 30 -fold specific IgG increases in vaginal secretions. Strong serum responses to CTB were also induced by both routes of vaccination. A notable difference between nasal and <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> was that the nasal route elicited a specific antibody response with a later onset but of much longer duration than did the oral route. We conclude from this study that the nasal route is superior to the oral route for administering at least nonliving vaccines against infections in the upper respiratory tract, whereas either <b>oral</b> or nasal <b>vaccination</b> might be used for eliciting antibody responses in the female genital tract...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact on}} antigen uptake and {{antibody}} response {{by the addition}} of absorption enhancers to Vibrio anguillarum O 2 antigen was studied in <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> trials of African catfish (Clarias gariepinus). <b>Oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> was achieved by feeding lag time coated pellets. The lag time coat prevents premature release of the encapsulated vaccine in the tank, before ingestion of the pellets by the fish. To monitor the antigen uptake, a competitive ELISA was used. The antibody response was measured using an indirect ELISA. Feeding of bacterin-layered pellets without absorption enhancers resulted in a rather low antigen uptake and antibody levels. The addition of absorption enhancers such as sodium salicylate, sodium caprate and vitamin E TPGS increased the serum antigen levels and specific antibody levels in the systemic circulation.

40|$|<b>Oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> as {{a method}} of rabies {{eradication}} in the field was first started in Switzerland in 1978 and after 1984 several other EU countries followed this practice. Due to <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> some European countries are now rabies-free in terrestrial animals. In Slovenia, after the first experimental <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> and study of vaccination models from 1988 - 1992, the spring-autumn campaigns have been carried out since 1995. The model of <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> of <b>wildlife</b> requires 16 - 20 baits per km 2 in the vaccination area. The baits were distributed by plane. They were dispersed from a height of 300 - 500 m. The aeroplanes' paths were 1000 metres apart. In the vaccination campaigns two vaccines were used. Lysvulpen®, produced by the Bioveta company at the Czech Republic, was laid down in the southwestern part of the country, and Fuchsoral®, produced by the German company Impfstoffwerk Dessau-Tornau, was placed {{in the eastern part of}} Slovenia. A rapid decline of rabies was evidenced from 1995 to 1999, when the <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> program in the whole territory using the aircraft baits distributing system was practiced. In 1999, only 6 rabies cases were laboratory-confirmed, whereas in 1995, 1089 rabies cases were documented. Of the 14 rabies cases detected in 1998, 12 were found as an island in a circle with a radius of 30 km in the centre of the vaccinated area. In 2000 and 2001, rabies incidence increased again, so it was decided to change the baits distribution system in the year 2001. The vaccination by crossing flights in certain areas was introduced. In the next year (2002), after changing the vaccination strategy, positive cases rapidly dropped and only 15 cases in 2002, and 8 cases were found in 2003, near the non-vaccinated border with Croatia...|$|R

40|$|M-cells (microfold cells) {{are thought}} to be a primary conduit of {{intestinal}} antigen trafficking. Using an established neutralizing anti-RANKL (Receptor Activator of NF-κB Ligand) antibody treatment to transiently deplete M-cells in vivo, we sought to determine whether intestinal M-cells were required for the effective induction of protective immunity following <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> with ΔiglB (a defined live attenuated Francisella novicida mutant). M-cell depleted, ΔiglB-vaccinated mice exhibited increased (but not significant) morbidity and mortality following a subsequent homotypic or heterotypic pulmonary F. tularensis challenge. No significant differences in splenic IFN-γ, IL- 2, or IL- 17 or serum antibody (IgG 1, IgG 2 a, IgA) production were observed compared to non-depleted, ΔiglB-vaccinated animals suggesting complementary mechanisms for ΔiglB entry. Thus, we examined other possible routes of gastrointestinal antigen sampling following <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> and found that ΔiglB co-localized to villus goblet cells and enterocytes. These results provide insight into the role of M-cells and complementary pathways in intestinal antigen trafficking that may be involved in the generation of optimal immunity following <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination...</b>|$|R
40|$|Different {{vaccination}} {{methods have}} been applied to protect fish against the detrimental effects of various pathogens. Several studies have shown the potentials of <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination.</b> In theory <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> is an effortless and stress-free method which can be applied at almost any age. In general, however, the vaccine has to be protected to avoid digestion, which results in high costs for application in aquaculture. In this paper we introduce a cost-effective <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> strategy for viral diseases of fish. The vaccines discussed here include fusion proteins consisting of a gut adhesion molecule and a viral peptide expressed in plants. The adhesion molecule mediates binding to and uptake from the gut, whereas the viral peptide functions as vaccine antigen mediating the induction of a humoral immune response. The first pilot studies using a fusion of the gut adhesion molecule and well-characterised heterologous linear B- and T-cell viral epitopes, produced in potato tubers, showed a promising binding and subsequent uptake in the end gut of carp. The results further indicated that a specific humoral immune response was evoked...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the late}} 1980 s, results of <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> trials {{in several states}} have {{provided}} growing evidence that this vaccination method may be effective for controlling the spread of rabies in raccoons (Procyon lotor). This study examines the economic feasibility of using <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> {{on a larger scale}} than previous trials. We analyze the benefits and costs associated with a hypothetical barrier that would stretch from Lake Erie to the Gulf of Mexico, combining natural geographic features provided by the Appalachian Mountains with <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> zones. The goal of this barrier would be to prevent the raccoon rabies variant from moving west into broader geographic regions of the United States. The costs of establishing and maintaining this hypothetical barrier are compared to the avoided costs of not having to live with raccoon rabies west of its current distribution. The westward advance of raccoon rabies, if it is not contained, is projected using simple models based on constant rates of spread. Our results show that preventing the westward movement of raccoon rabies by combining an <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> program with natural barriers may be economically feasible. Discounted costs of establishing and maintaining the barrier are estimated to total between US$ 58 million and US$ 148 million. Net benefits of program implementation range between US$ 48 million and US$ 496 million for a variety of models, including ones that exclude forgone pet vaccination expenditures. The analysis also provides a framework for developing future models to explore the benefits and costs of eliminating raccoon rabies from currently affected areas...|$|R
40|$|<b>Oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> {{can offer}} a painless and {{convenient}} method of vaccination. Furthermore, in addition to systemic immunity it has potential to stimulate mucosal immunity through antigen-processing by the gut-associated lymphoid tissues. In this study we propose the concept that pollen grains can be engineered {{for use as a}} simple modular system for <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination.</b> We demonstrate feasibility of this concept by using spores of Lycopodium clavatum (clubmoss) (LSs). We show that LSs can be chemically cleaned to remove native proteins to create intact clean hollow LS shells. Empty pollen shells were successfully filled with molecules of different sizes demonstrating their potential to be broadly applicable as a vaccination system. Using ovalbumin (OVA) as a model antigen, LSs formulated with OVA were orally fed to mice. LSs stimulated significantly higher anti-OVA serum IgG and fecal IgA antibodies compared to those induced by use of cholera toxin as a positive-control adjuvant. The antibody response was not affected by pre-neutralization of the stomach acid, and persisted for up to 7 months. Confocal microscopy revealed that LSs can translocate into mouse intestinal wall.

Increased resistance to S 2308 infection occurred at 12 to 20 weeks in mice vaccinated i. p. with SRB 51 (5 x 10 (8) or 5 x 10 (6) CFU) but occurred at 12 weeks only in mice vaccinated orally with SRB 51 (5 x 10 (8) CFU). <b>Oral</b> SRB 51 <b>vaccination</b> induced lower levels of antibodies to the surface antigens of intact SRB 51 bacteria than did i. p. vaccination. However, neither route of vaccination induced anamnestic antibody responses to the surface antigens of intact S 2308 bacteria after challenge infection of the vaccinated mice with S 2308. Mice vaccinated orally with SRB 51 and challenged with S 2308 at 12 to 20 weeks had lower and less persistent spleen cell proliferation and production of gamma interferon in response to S 2308 and certain immunodominant S 2308 proteins (32 to < or = 18 kDa) than did mice vaccinated i. p. with SRB 51. However, mice vaccinated orally or i. p. with SRB 51 and challenged with S 2308 had similar spleen cell tumor necrosis factor alpha production. These results indicate that <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> of mice with SRB 51 was effective in inducing protective immunity to S 2308 infection, although the immunity was lower and less persistent than that induced by i. p. vaccination.

40|$|Enteric {{infections are}} {{a major cause of}} {{mortality}} and morbidity with significant social and economic implications worldwide and particularly in developing countries. An attractive approach to minimizing the impact of these diseases is via the development of <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> strategies. However, <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> is challenging due to the tolerogenic and hyporesponsive nature of antigen presenting cells resident in the gastrointestinal tract. The inclusion of adjuvants in oral vaccine formulations has the potential to overcome this challenge. To date no oral adjuvants have been licenced for human use and thus oral adjuvant discovery remains a key goal in improving the potential for oral vaccine development. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells are a recently discovered population of unconventional T cells characterized by an evolutionarily conserved ?? T cell receptor (TCR) that recognizes antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I-related (MR 1) molecule. MAIT cells are selected intra-thymically by MR 1 expressing double positive thymocytes and enter the circulation with a na?ve phenotype. In the circulation they develop a memory phenotype and are programmed to home to mucosal tissues and the liver. Once resident in these tissues, MAIT cells respond to bacterial and yeast infections through the production of chemokines and cytokines that aid in the induction of an adaptive immune response. Their abundance in the gastrointestinal tract and ability to promote adaptive immunity suggests that MAIT cell activators may represent attractive novel adjuvants for use in <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination...</b>|$|R

During the seawater growing stage, fish become more susceptible to several types of disease, due to the natural decay of vaccine-induced immune responses. In this study, we demonstrate the immune response and efficacy of a new salmonid rickettsial septicaemia (SRS) oral vaccine, developed using MicroMatrixTM Technology. The vaccine, which is administered together with daily feed ration, induces a specific immune response at local and systemic levels. Anti- Piscirickettsia salmonis specific antibodies were detected as soon as 300 degree-days after <b>vaccination.</b> Furthermore, <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> was able to protect fish against a lethal pathogen challenge when administered either as a primary vaccination or as a booster for an injected vaccine. Results show that <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> is an efficacious treatment {{for the prevention of}} SRS outbreaks throughout the salmon culture period...|$|R

The emergence of drug-resistant strains makes treating the disease complicated and expensive for government health departments, and unpleasant and laborious for patients. The current vaccine, parenterally administered BCG, is only 50 % effective. <b>Oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> {{has the advantage}} of targeting the mucosal immune system, which acts at the direct site of initial exposure to the infecting airborne pathogen. In addition, oral vaccines are cheaper and safer to administer than parenteral vaccines. This dissertation provides a conceptual framework for the prevention of the disease by means of <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> and outlines methods that were developed for the production of concentrated purified somatic and extracellular antigens. Immune responses to somatic antigens were also examined in conjunction with established and novel adjuvants. The role of Propionibacterium jensenii 702 as a suitable mucosal adjuvant was supported by the results obtained. Masters Thesi...|$|R

Despite {{the fact that the}} infectious agent is very well known and effective preventive vaccination of animals as well as the postexposure treatment of human population have been existed for many decades, thousands of people die of rabies in the world annually. The aim of the work was {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} measures, using the methods of retrospective epidemiological analyses, which brought the eradication of rabies in the whole series of western European countries. The main characteristics of the rabies virus are included, the occurrence of the serotypes and genotypes in the varies parts of the world, the problematic of terrestrial (urban and sylvatic) form of rabies and rabies among bat population which is under increasing attention especially in the rabies free countries. Development of rabies vaccines, mainly vaccines for <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> are described. The laboratory diagnostics including the way of evaluation of the <b>oral</b> <b>vaccination</b> campaigns results are also discussed. The results record in detail the animal disease situation development in the Czech Republic with a special view to the period since the beginning of the <b>oral</b> rabies <b>vaccination</b> field trial in 1989 in dependence on progressive enlargement of the treated area.
