5|$|Finding her mother's body, Buffy {{at first}} denies what she sees, {{to the point}} of imagining {{alternate}} realities. Whedon stated that these mini dream sequences were like documentaries; people who find their loved ones dead are desperate to imagine a different, better outcome, and they create fantasies that cause much more pain when they are forced to return to the harshness of reality. Later in the hospital, Buffy imagines <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> {{have been able to do}} to save Joyce, although the doctor tells her there was nothing to be done. Willow and Xander express anger and helplessness. Anya, new to mortality and human connections, is childlike in her innocence and questions. Xander's anger and Anya's confusion allow them to be mothered somewhat by Willow, who needs to take care of someone. Dawn is deeply in denial, unable to understand that the woman she thought she had known all her life was gone. Tara, who has gone through the ordeal before, represents the acceptance phase, soothing and helping the others to work through what they are experiencing. Buffy toward the end also begins to see acceptance when she tells Dawn that the body in the morgue is not their mother; Joyce is gone.|$|E
25|$|In each episode, Dolly Singh {{creates a}} video diary {{containing}} advice for Nikki about {{their family and}} life as a teenager. Dolly tries to show Nikki <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> go through in the video diary so she will always know how to figure things out, even in Dolly's absence. In the third season of the show, Nikki's younger sibling Bobby is born. The show went on hiatus on November8, 2015, and later showed the remaining episodes at 9p.m. on Disney Channel India. The show went on hiatus to give airtime to Vicky & Vetaal season two, which began airing on November15, 2015.|$|E
25|$|However, {{police were}} not able to develop any {{evidence}} from this material that might have helped them locate Bethany. Roldan later stopped cooperating with the investigation; he has subsequently been described by law enforcement as a person of interest. Emile Decker later obtained a divorce from his missing wife. It has since been reported that he will no longer talk with investigators unless his lawyer, who says his client has nothing to hide, is also present. No record was ever found suggesting that Bethany had given birth by her expected due date later that summer, although Loudoun County police distributed to the public pictures of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> look like near the end of a pregnancy.|$|E
60|$|Miss Milray {{went from}} Clementina {{to call upon}} her sister-in-law, and found her brother, which was perhaps <b>what</b> <b>she</b> hoped <b>might</b> happen.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are very}} kind," [...] {{she said at}} last with faltering voice, as <b>she</b> meditated in <b>what</b> words <b>she</b> <b>might</b> best convey her refusal.|$|R
6000|$|He {{took it as}} if <b>what</b> <b>she</b> meant <b>might</b> {{be other}} than her {{description}} of it. [...] "You're deceiving two persons then, Mrs. Lowder and somebody else?" ...|$|R
500|$|... "The Wedding of River Song" [...] concludes {{the story}} {{arc of the}} Doctor's {{apparent}} death {{which began in the}} series opener, [...] "The Impossible Astronaut" [...] and resolves more pieces of River Song's timeline. Despite this, it leaves ambiguous whether the Doctor and River are legitimately married. Showrunner and episode writer Steven Moffat described it as [...] "a big roller coaster ride of Doctor Who madness". One of the [...] "mad idea" [...] he included in the episode, [...] "Live Chess", came because Moffat wanted to make chess— which he called [...] "one of the most boring games in the world"— into a dangerous spectator sport. Originally, the script did not include the brief scene with a Dalek; Moffat had intended to rest the Doctor's most famous adversary for the sixth series. Amy's confrontation with Madame Kovarian, a scene which shows <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have been like had she not met the Doctor, was also added into the script later.|$|E
500|$|While at the manor, Kyra {{bonds with}} Phoebe Halliwell (Alyssa Milano) over their shared powers of premonition. She guides Phoebe and Lieutenant Darryl Morris (Dorian Gregory) to Inspector Sheridan (Jenya Lano), {{a member of}} the San Francisco police {{department}} who was placed in a coma by FBI agent Kyle Brody (Kerr Smith); Brody had sequestered Sheridan after she discovered the truth about the Halliwell sisters being witches. Kyra shares her premonition of the Avatars with Phoebe. While the prior episodes established the Avatar as a threat, Kyra's vision shows Phoebe and her future daughter living in a utopia where demons no longer exist. After witnessing the vision, Phoebe has a premonition of the demon Zankou (Oded Fehr) vanquishing Kyra. In order to prevent Kyra's death, Phoebe convinces the Elders to provide a spell to turn Kyra human. During this time, Kyra forces Leo to reveal his true identity as an Avatar to the sisters. While Piper Halliwell (Holly Marie Combs) helps her to prepare for her new life as a mortal, Kyra reveals her real name and abandons her title as [...] "the Seer". Before the sisters can transform Kyra into a mortal, Zankou kills her because of her betrayal of the demonic world, and his fear of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> tell the sisters. Her death is {{a turning point in the}} season as it pushes the sisters to agree to meet and help the Avatars build their new world.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the second}} story, The Highlanders, Jamie McCrimmon joined the TARDIS crew, and {{remained}} with the Second Doctor {{for the rest}} of his travels. Ben and Polly left together when the TARDIS landed at Gatwick Airport on the same day they originally left with the First Doctor, after they had stopped the mass kidnapping of tourists by shape shifting aliens. The Doctor and Jamie then became involved in a plot by the Daleks to gain both the [...] "Human and Dalek Factors" [...] when the TARDIS was stolen, which led to them meeting Victoria Waterfield in the 19th century. The Doctor used the situation to engineer a Dalek civil war that seemingly destroyed the Daleks forever. However, Victoria's father was among the casualties. Now an orphan, Victoria chose to accompany the Doctor and Jamie on their travels. Although she felt great affection for the Doctor and Jamie, she was never able to completely come to terms with life in the TARDIS and the constant danger that resulted. She eventually chose to leave after the events of Fury from the Deep and was adopted by someone in the 20th Century. The Doctor was then joined by Zoe Heriot, an extremely intelligent (if overly dependent on logic) woman from the 21st century, who helped defeat the Cybermen attack on a space station known as the Wheel. She then stowed away in the TARDIS and, despite the Doctor's warnings about <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> encounter, chose to remain.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite so," [...] said Sophia. Sophia's wit {{was usually}} ready enough, {{but at that}} moment she could not resolve with <b>what</b> words <b>she</b> <b>might</b> make the most {{appropriate}} reply to her--friend. <b>What</b> <b>she</b> did say was rather lame, but it was not dangerous.|$|R
60|$|The châtelain was so {{entranced by}} her gentle and sweet manner that {{he leaned forward}} to listen, lest a {{syllable}} of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> whispered <b>might</b> escape his ears.|$|R
60|$|<b>What</b> more <b>she</b> <b>might</b> {{have said}} is unknown; for Livy closed her mouth with a big sponge, and all retired to repose after the trials of the past night.|$|R
60|$|Gillian {{began to}} be quite afraid of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have said.|$|E
60|$|Once {{more she}} was silent, {{pressing}} her lips closely together, as if afraid of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> say.|$|E
60|$|Col. And by that night's {{work have}} given her a proof, <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> expect for ever after.|$|E
60|$|MRS. H. Wait a moment, Lucius. What grieved her was {{the giving}} in to Cissy's determination, seeing with her eyes, and not {{allowing}} herself to perceive that <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wished <b>might</b> not be good for her.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have said}} nothing which you need ever have cause to regret," [...] he replied. He was too great for excuses, too great for any sorrow save <b>what</b> <b>she</b> herself <b>might</b> feel, {{as great as}} the silent hills from which he came.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course the}} estab--," [...] and then Mrs. Proudie, who was blandly {{continuing}} her list of congratulations, whispered her sentence close {{into the car}} of Mrs. Grantly, so that not a word of <b>what</b> <b>she</b> said <b>might</b> be audible by the young people.|$|R
6000|$|One {{thing she}} had {{determined}} upon: her money should not come between her and those who loved her and who were loved by her. No matter <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> do or <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> not do, she would not look down upon people simply because she was rich, and oh, the blessed thought which followed that! There would be nobody who could look down upon {{her because she was}} not rich! ...|$|E
60|$|Over {{the soft}} green turf, under the {{beautiful}} trees, by the bright flowers of the parterres {{and through the}} natural beauty of the charming park, he led her; but not a word did she say of the soft colors and the soft air. Not a flower did she look at. It seemed to her as if she trod a bleak and stony road. She dreaded <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> hear, <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> see.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{cannot be}} {{surprised}} that my mother should be vexed. Besides, {{you would not be}} angry with a lady for <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> say." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} believe that she was dead, yet where <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be in this savage world, and under <b>what</b> frightful {{conditions}} <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be living, I could not guess.|$|R
60|$|Miss Todd, however, {{promised to}} make inquiries, and {{declared}} her intention of communicating <b>what</b> intelligence <b>she</b> <b>might</b> obtain direct to Miss Mackenzie. Miss Baker resisted {{this for a}} little while, but ultimately submitted, as she was wont to do, to the stronger character of her friend.|$|R
60|$|Yet, as Lillie spoke, she knew, {{in her own}} {{slippery}} little heart, {{that the}} shadow of this awful cloud of maternity was resting over her; though she laced and danced, and bid defiance to every law of nature, with a blind and ignorant wilfulness, not caring <b>what</b> consequences <b>she</b> <b>might</b> draw down on herself, if only <b>she</b> <b>might</b> escape this.|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was only}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have expected. An {{unpleasant}} fate generally overtakes {{people who go}} about disturbing things," [...] Mrs. Chisholm said severely.|$|E
6000|$|... "Be comforted," [...] I replied, {{wondering}} <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> mean by this loosing of the Powers. [...] "I {{think that}} she loves him too well." ...|$|E
60|$|She's kaimit out her lang black hair, That {{fell below}} her knee. She's ta'en the apple in her hand, To see <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> see.|$|E
6000|$|... "A great deal, Miss Harvey," [...] said Tom, across {{whom the}} {{recollection}} of Grace's influence flashed {{for the first}} time. <b>What</b> a help <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be to him! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will leave}} others {{to think of}} that. But, father, her guilt will not stain me. Are we not bound to {{remember}} <b>what</b> injury <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have done to us, and how we might still have been ignorant of all this, had not she herself confessed it--for our sakes--for our sakes, father?" ...|$|R
60|$|Harriet behaved {{extremely}} {{well on the}} occasion, with great self-command. <b>What</b> ever <b>she</b> <b>might</b> feel of brighter hope, she betrayed nothing. Emma was gratified, to observe such a proof in her of strengthened character, and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance. They spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill's death with mutual forbearance.|$|R
60|$|Ethelberta said nothing; and {{the dull}} winter {{atmosphere}} had far from light enough {{in it to}} show by her face <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> be thinking.|$|E
60|$|Joan {{suddenly}} {{clung to}} him with all her might, quivering in a silent joy. It had not occurred to Jim <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> have thought.|$|E
60|$|The Maid knew no word of our speech, {{and this}} passion of Elliot's, and so sudden {{a change from}} {{kindness}} to wrath, were <b>what</b> <b>she</b> <b>might</b> not understand.|$|E
6000|$|Hypatia's arms dropped suddenly. Yes; it was true! The thought flashed {{across her}} mind with mingled delight and terror.... Visions of her {{childhood}} rose swift and thick--temples--sacrifices--priesthoods-- colleges--museums! <b>What</b> <b>might</b> <b>she</b> not do? <b>What</b> <b>might</b> <b>she</b> not make Africa? Give her ten years of power, and the hated name of Christian might be forgotten, and Athene Polias, colossal in ivory and gold, watching in calm triumph over the harbours of a heathen Alexandria.... But the price! ...|$|R
60|$|Each time I {{returned}} to Ealing, life there seemed more alien, narrow, and unattractive--and Marion less beautiful and more limited and difficult--until {{at last she}} was robbed of every particle of her magic. She gave me always a cooler welcome, I think, until she seemed entirely apathetic. I never asked myself then <b>what</b> heartaches <b>she</b> <b>might</b> hide or <b>what</b> her discontents might be.|$|R
60|$|She rushed {{from the}} room, with cheeks burning like fire. Come <b>what</b> <b>might,</b> <b>she</b> never {{could talk to}} any living soul again about that awful episode.|$|R
