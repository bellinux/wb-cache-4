25|$|The government, {{upon hearing}} of the SNM attack on Burao, began {{rounding}} up Isaaq men fearing they would assist an SNM attack on Hargeisa. Detainees were taken {{to a number of}} locations including Birjeeh (a former military headquarters of the 26th sector of the Somali Armed Forces), Malka-Durduro (a military compound), the Central Prison of Hargeisa, the headquarters of NSS (National Security Service), the headquarters of the Military Police as well as other secret detention centres. Isaaq military officers were one of the first groups to be arrested. According to Human Rights Watch's Africa <b>Watch,</b> <b>some</b> 700 Isaaqs from the armed forces were brought to one prison, this particular prison was already overcrowded, an additional 70 military personnel were then also brought for detention (40 from Gabiley and 30 from Hargeisa). Arrests were done at such scale that, {{to make room for the}} Isaaqs detainees, all non-Isaaqs were released, including those sentenced to death or life imprisonment for murder and drug-related offences. Some of those released to make room for Isaaq detainees were given arms and made guards over Isaaq detainees whilst others joined the military.|$|E

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1919, while {{recovering}} from a serious pulmonary condition, Cardus took up a suggestion from his news editor, William Percival Crozier, that he should <b>watch</b> <b>some</b> cricket at Old Trafford and, if he felt able, write reports on a few matches. On 19 May 1919 Cardus went to {{the first day of}} Lancashire's match with Derbyshire. His first published cricket report, on the following day, showed little sign of his later characteristic style: [...] "I simply had no intention of writing on cricket for any length of time; this was a spare-time affair... and I fitted myself into the idioms and procedures of the sporting writers of 1919". Scott nonetheless saw a potential, and from the beginning of 1920 Cardus became the paper's regular cricket correspondent, under the by-line [...] "Cricketer", a position he held for 20 years.|$|E

500|$|A report {{based on}} {{eyewitness}} statements {{submitted by the}} Citizens' Initiative to the National Human Rights Commission of India states that the State Reserve Police (SRP), a force of specially trained emergency police, were seen chasing the victims and helping the rioters rather than calming the situation. According to Human Rights <b>Watch,</b> <b>some</b> victims {{said that they were}} able to handle the crowd but when police and SRP joined in, it became difficult as the police sided with the rioters and fired on Muslim residents. The state government denied these allegations; Modi said that police fired to [...] "contain outbreaks of violence" [...] and added that they had [...] "mowed down people to quell the violence". The Special Investigation Team also defended the role played by officials and said that everything was done to stop the violence.|$|E
500|$|Curtis asked Moffat to criticise [...] "anything and everything" [...] {{and later}} {{said he was}} very honest. Executive {{producer}} Piers Wenger and director Jonny Campbell also critiqued the script. Moffat told Curtis that it needed to [...] "start quicker" [...] and that the meeting with the Doctor and Vincent was [...] "dull" [...] {{and needed to be}} something [...] "cute" [...] like Curtis had done in his films. He also noted that the Doctor did not talk as much as Curtis had written and recommended Curtis <b>watch</b> <b>some</b> episodes to see he was [...] "rather efficient in the way that he talked". Curtis enjoyed the experience, commenting that it was [...] "fun" [...] to work within boundaries rather than doing it all himself. After seeing a read-through performed by leads Matt Smith and Karen Gillan, Curtis made more changes. He commented that it was easy to write for them as they were [...] "so delightful and modern and relaxed". Curtis's original title for the episode was [...] "Eyes that See the Darkness", but he said this was vetoed.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{treatment for}} Toy Story, drafted by Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, and Pete Docter, had {{little in common}} with the eventually finished film. It paired Tinny, the one-man band from Tin Toy with a ventriloquist's dummy and sent them on a sprawling odyssey. Under studio head Jeffrey Katzenberg, Woody was the main villain, abusing the other toys until they rallied against him; however, after Disney executives saw the storyboards they relinquished creative control to Pixar. The core idea of Toy Story was present from the treatment onward, however: that [...] "toys deeply want children to play with them, and that this desire drives their hopes, fears, and actions." [...] Katzenberg felt the original treatment was problematic and told Lasseter to reshape Toy Story as more of an odd-couple buddy picture, and suggested they <b>watch</b> <b>some</b> classic buddy movies, such as The Defiant Ones and 48 Hrs., in which two characters with different attitudes are thrown together and have to bond. Lasseter, Stanton, and Docter emerged in early September 1991 with the second treatment, and although the lead characters were still Tinny and the dummy, the outline of the final film was beginning to take shape.|$|E

Of course, I would have to pay Stanton Friedman $10,000 — based on my long-standing wager that UFOs will never be proven real — but I would expect to become wealthy from the royalties of a new book titled Why Me, ET?.
