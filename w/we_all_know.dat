A lot of people don’t seem {{to understand that we}} can’t keep producing records if you keep not paying for them. Bands are having to sell beautiful albums for €2.99, labels can’t give you as much support since they’re losing income too and our alternative radio stations* are practically non existent now, meaning so many wonderful bands will not get a chance to get played on radio as they’ll be competing with huge pop acts.|$|E
5|$|In fact, {{building}} a society the Shaftesbury way {{is not a}} matter of imprisoning a presumed evil spirit of mankind. It is a matter of beauty and truth. Both Goethe and Voltaire were influenced by the 3rd Lord Shaftesbury. The former particularly reminded us that we must cultivate our garden. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> about large prize-winning marrows, but are not succulent baby courgettes more perfect? Small is beautiful too...|$|E
5|$|It is poetic {{justice that}} a {{helicopter}} {{is now at}} the heart of the Government's embarrassment and in the centre of their dilemma. Indeed, it was hard to blame the prison officer who observed that he thought it was the Minister for Defence paying an informal visit to Mountjoy Prison yesterday because, of course, <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> the Minister for Defence is wont to use helicopters, as somebody observed already, as other Ministers are wont to use State cars.|$|E

You never pay that much for the computer time and I think that research will show that they were using someone else's computer time; someone else was paying for that. It could have been Honeywell where Paul Allen was working. So <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> {{this to be a}} spurious argument." ...|$|R

25|$|The {{winter season}} in Paris profited {{from all this}} {{to add a little}} spice to its pleasures. While the {{newspapers}} sounded the alarm to alert people to the danger, and while appeals were made to the public authorities to do something about it, song-writers, satirists and other men of wit and spirit, provoked great pleasure among the leisured classes by playing with the word 'cube', discovering that it was a very suitable means of inducing laughter which, as <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know,</b> is the principle characteristic that distinguishes man from the animals.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to rumors {{circulating}} on the Internet today, Joni {{is not in}} a coma. Joni {{is still}} in the hospital – but she comprehends, she's alert, and she has her full senses. A full recovery is expected. The document obtained by a certain media outlet simply gives her longtime friend Leslie Morris the authority – in the absence of 24-hour doctor care – to make care decisions for Joni once she leaves the hospital. As <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know,</b> Joni is a strong-willed woman and is nowhere near giving up the fight. Please continue to keep Joni in your thoughts.|$|E

For guys to have success where it maybe goes against the grain, against the culture.... I know I {{probably}} didn't {{get a couple of}} jobs in my career because people could not see my personality or the way I was going to do it.... For your faith to be more important than your job, for your family to be more important than that job.... <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> that's the way it should be, but we're afraid to say that sometimes. Lovie's not afraid to say it and I'm not afraid to say it.|$|E

25|$|A soldier whose {{business}} is murder {{as a fine}} art, a diplomat whose calling is based on deception and secretiveness, a politician whose very life consists in compromises with his conscience, a business man whose aim is personal profit within the limits allowed by a lenient law—such may be excused if they set patriotic deception above common everyday decency and perform services as spies. They merely accept the code of morality to which modern society still conforms. Not so the scientist. The very essence of his life is the service of truth. <b>We</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> scientists who in private life do not {{come up to the}} standard of truthfulness, but who, nevertheless, would not consciously falsify the results of their researches. It is bad enough if we {{have to put up with}} these, because they reveal a lack of strength of character that is liable to distort the results of their work. A person, however, who uses science as a cover for political spying, who demeans himself to pose before a foreign government as an investigator and asks for assistance in his alleged researches in order to carry on, under this cloak, his political machinations, prostitutes science in an unpardonable way and forfeits the right to be classed as a scientist.|$|E
25|$|Like {{all great}} artists, Licia's {{specific}} ingenuity as a singer, the originality of her art, {{lay in the}} fact that technique for this artist at least was always {{a means to an end}} and never an end in itself: for the salient features of all great art is the ability to connect technique to the emotions. Any other approach would have been for Albanese contrary to the musical sense with which she was born, contrary to musical training she acquired, and, if such exists, contrary to her musical morality. It was this, Licia's uniqueness and musical mastery which drew me, which drew us, into the world of Mimi, Cio-Cio-San, Manon, Liu and Violetta week after week, year after year, inviting me to a place and places I had never been before. It is for all these reasons that Virgil Thomson was able to write of Licia's first Violetta: 'She did not sing the role, she recreated it for our times.' As <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know,</b> Albanese's art is capable of the widest range of effects from the tragic to the comedic, from dramatic repertoire to the lyrical and even soubrette: and for anyone fortunate enough to have heard her rendition of operetta pieces, she leaves no doubt in the mind that she was born to the operetta form as well as to the rest.|$|E

In an article called [...] "Let's save the giant baby-faced deer statue!", he wrote: [...] "As <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know,</b> I love this statue. I love it a lot. And I think we can save it. There are lots of places in Portland that could use some beautification, and a little public art {{can go a long}} way." [...] Spencer and a colleague compiled a gallery of images created using Adobe Photoshop to illustrate the sculpture's potential.|$|E
500|$|One of Jenny's storylines {{in season}} two was her revelation of being sexually abused as a child. The events were portrayed {{in a series}} of flashbacks and dream sequences. Yet, this left viewers {{confused}} about what actually happened to Jenny. During an interview with LGBT monthly magazine The Advocate, Chaiken commented about the storyline: [...] "Well <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> it was an incident of sexual abuse. I had not wanted to be more explicit about it than that – one because memory of trauma is very strange. Who knows what happened to Jenny? Jenny doesn't necessarily know herself." ...|$|E

This river contains {{a wide variety of}} plant and animal life. An early American environmentalist named Gifford Pinchot said of the Everglades, [...] "It is a region so different that it hardly seems to belong to the United States. It is full of the most vivid and most interesting life on land, in the air, and in the water. It is a land of strangeness, separate and apart from the common things <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> so well." ...|$|E

500|$|Reflecting on {{the success}} of the song in 2002, Vig admitted: [...] "People still ask us who the 'Stupid Girl' is, and that's {{impossible}} to answer. The song is sort of meant to be a wake up call. It could be about an ex-girlfriend. It could be about a rock diva that <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know,</b> it could be about your sister. It could also be called 'Stupid Boy'." [...] Looking back, he also stated, [...] "It's impossible to predict what will be a hit. But subconsciously, I knew the song was good when I kept playing the same rough mix over and over again on my car stereo for months." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the episode's broadcast, the Fox network {{received}} several angry letters and emails from concerned Catholics, who were uneasy with the commercial scene. According to Scully, {{the letters were}} worded the same, and all started with [...] "My family and I have always enjoyed The Simpsons, until last night..." [...] Nevertheless, the letters provoked a reaction from The Simpsons staff, and in an interview, Scully said, [...] "We {{got a couple of}} hundred letters, and it was very obvious from reading a majority of them that [...] had not seen the show. Some of them were from third-graders, all saying the same thing: 'Please don't make fun of my religion.' Which <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> third-graders are very adamant about." ...|$|E
500|$|Iginla is {{well known}} for his kind-hearted nature. Former Flames General manager Craig Button {{described}} Iginla as being grounded: [...] "He doesn't carry himself with any attitude or arrogance. He's confident in his abilities. He's self-assured. He's genuine. He's a better person than he is a player, and <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> what kind of player he is." [...] In 2002, while in Salt Lake City for the Winter Olympic Games, Iginla struck up a conversation with four Calgarians sitting next to his table, and found out they were sleeping in their car outside of the hotel. He excused himself from the conversation, and booked them accommodations at his own expense at the hotel his family was staying in.|$|E

500|$|Bruce LaBruce {{wrote of}} Munro's impact on Toronto, {{just prior to}} his death: [...] "As <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know,</b> Toronto can be a cruel and unforgiving city. What makes Will Munro so {{extraordinary}} {{as an artist and}} as a person is that he has not only remained true to such a harsh mistress, but that he has also contributed so substantially to the fabric and heft of this often maleficent metropolis. His dedication to community work (including volunteering for a decade at an LGBT youth crisis hotline) and to creating social and sexual stimulation for the queer community outside the decaying gay ghetto (namely, his wonderfully raunchy club night, Vazaleen, and his participation as a founding partner in revitalizing the Beaver Café) is unmatched." ...|$|E

[...] Later while attending Jinsei Gakuen High School, Watanabe was called up by Suzuki to compete with the national team in 2013. He made his debut on the international stage at the 2013 East Asia Basketball Championship and stayed with Japan for the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship. At the event, Watanabe averaged 5.3 points, 1.3 rebounds, and 0.5 assists in four games played. He helped the team finish in ninth place.|$|E

Initially [...] most French film critics were {{influenced}} by the negative reviews of Jean-Paul Sartre in 1945 and Georges Sadoul in 1946. At that time many French intellectuals and filmmakers shared Sartre's negative opinion that Hollywood filmmakers were uncultured. Sartre criticized the film's flashbacks for its nostalgic and romantic preoccupation with the past instead of the realities of the present and said that [...] "the whole film is based on a misconception of what cinema is all about. The film is in the past tense, whereas <b>we</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> that cinema has got to be in the present tense." ...|$|E
