5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} the {{fraternity}} boys, {{and one of them}} tells her information that leads to her suspecting a boy named Chip. Keith and Harmony flirt, and Harmony shows a good amount of true romantic interest in Keith. Logan’s family has been donating $10,000 a month to “Aaron’s Kids”, which Veronica learns is not actually a charity. Veronica talks to Chip, who says that he was with another girl, who admits it while saying that she’ll never say so openly. Veronica turns her suspicion on Dick. After doing more digging, Veronica says that the money is going to Logan’s illegitimate brother, Charlie Stone. Parker insults Veronica for supposedly working with the fraternity. Keith catches Harmony’s husband kissing another woman. After talking to one of the other rape victims, Veronica discusses Claire with a slightly offbeat clerk, who says that Claire <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> a guy. Logan meets Charlie (Matt Czuchry), and they connect over surfing. However, Veronica notices some inconsistencies at Charlie’s private school job.|$|E

25|$|Shastri had a {{slow start}} to the tournament but {{finished}} with fifties {{in the last three}} matches. Srikkanth too scored three fifties and India posted century opening stands against Australia and in the final. India <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> two spinners for every match. It helped that all the matches were played at Melbourne and Sydney which have turning tracks and long boundaries. Sivaramakrishnan and Shastri claimed 18 wickets between them in five matches.|$|E
25|$|The second Test {{match was}} {{restricted}} to 105 minutes of play, rain and poor pitch conditions accounting for the rest. Australia were suffering from the same ill health that had weakened the team before and during their match in Cambridge; Trumble and Howell had influenza, while Darling, Noble and Saunders all felt ill, though did {{take part in the}} game. Saunders thus replaced Howell in the playing eleven. England <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the same eleven that had played in Birmingham, with Tom Taylor as twelfth man.|$|E
25|$|The 19th Bn Royal Malay Regiment (Mech) was {{involved}} in the rescue of US Rangers and Delta Force operatives in Somalia during the Battle of Mogadishu. The unit of 32 Radpanzer Condor APCs and 113 men from MALBATT 1 <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the United States 10th Mountain Division to rescue the trapped Rangers. Four APCs were immobilised and were destroyed by US helicopter gunships. 19 Royal Malay Regiment suffered 1 soldier killed in action (KIA), PFC Mat Aznan Awang while 8 others were wounded in action (WIA). Pfc Mat Aznan Awang was later promoted posthumously to Corporal and was awarded with Pingat Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa, the nation's highest gallantry award. In total, 7 officers and 26 NCOs were awarded various medals for their valour during the operation, the highest number of men recommended for medals in a single unit in a single operation.|$|E

25|$|Following World War II, Sonic founder Troy N. Smith Sr. {{returned}} to his hometown of Seminole, Oklahoma, where he became employed as a milkman. He decided to work delivering bread because bread was not as heavy as milk. Soon afterwards, Smith purchased the Cottage Cafe, a little diner in Shawnee, Oklahoma. Before long, he sold it and opened a fast food restaurant, Troy's Pan Full of Chicken, {{on the edge of}} town. In 1953, Smith <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> a business partner to purchase a five-acre parcel of land that had a log house and a walk-up root beer stand, already named the Top Hat. The two men continued with the operation of the root beer stand and converted the log house into a steak restaurant. After realizing that the stand was averaging $700 a week in the sale of root beer, hamburgers, and hot dogs, Smith decided to focus on the more-profitable root beer stand. He also bought out his business partner.|$|E
25|$|In 2017, New South Wales won Game 1, 28-4 {{sparking}} the New South Wales {{media to}} start proclaiming {{the beginning of}} the Blues Dynasty. Queensland won Game 2, 18-16 after making changes to the team with the returning Billy Slater and Johnathan Thurston, who kicked the winning goal for Queensland. Thurston injured his shoulder in the 30th minute of the match, essentially disabling it as he played out the whole match. Thurston was later ruled out {{for the rest of the}} year after scans revealed his shoulder needed a reconstruction, ending his representative career as he announced 2017 would be his last representative year. In Game 3, New South Wales <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> an unchanged lineup for all three games, the first to do so since 1996. Queensland dominated the Blues, winning 22-6, with Queensland Winger Dane Gagai winning the Wally Lewis Medal for Best Player in the series. It also had Johnathan Thurston raise the Origin Shield with Queensland Captain Cameron Smith, before being chaired off the ground by his teammates, ending Thurston's representative career on a high note.|$|E
500|$|The match {{attracted}} fervent debate amongst journalists, pundits {{and football}} players alike. Former referee Jeff Winter defended Riley's performance and described fixtures between Manchester United and Arsenal as [...] "impossible" [...] to manage. Premier League refereeing chief Keith Hackett added: [...] "We {{know this is}} one of the tough encounters of the season. Mike clearly had a game plan to try not to suppress the match. He wanted it to breathe and perhaps <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the intention of getting through the game without having to dismiss any players. In the back of his mind was trying to get through a game without having a blow-up and I think Mike did extremely well to keep a lid on things." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{song was}} co-produced by Canadian electro-pop band Dragonette, with Martina Sorbara. Roberts stated that Dragonette {{were among the}} first people who worked on the record. Roberts {{discussed}} the 1940s influence on the record, noting [...] "When I wrote 'Lucky Day' I had short hair and was really into '40s fashion. All of the 'woah woah woah woah' and the 'ah ha' really is a reflection of that." [...] She stated that {{when it came to the}} production of the track she wanted to produce a [...] "more downbeat dance record" [...] noting it was what she was into at that point. The track was written in February 2010, and when asked about working with Dragonette on the track, Roberts responded, [...] "I was with them for quite a while writing, and they were the first people that I <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> when I started making the record. I learnt a lot from them. They're really lovely people, they work really hard, they're so talented." ...|$|E

Max Martin, who produced Spears' debut single [...] "...Baby One More Time", produced [...] "If U Seek Amy" [...] for the album. The Outsyders, an Atlanta-based production team, produced the album's first single, while Fernando Garibay worked on two bonus songs for Spears. Danja reported that he worked on the tracks at Chalice Recording Studios in Los Angeles, and Spears recorded them at Glenwood Place Studios in Burbank; the Canadian trio Let's Go to War co-wrote and produced the track [...] "Mmm Papi". Lil Jon, Rodney Jerkins, Sean Garrett, and Taio Cruz announced they were working with Spears, though their songs weren't included on the official track listing.|$|E
500|$|The 2nd Raiders {{suffered}} 16killed and 17wounded (plus 2wounded native guides). Non-battle casualties totaled 225, {{of which}} 125suffered from malaria, 29 from dysentery, and 71 from ringworm or jungle rot. Most {{of the remaining}} raiders were also suffering some type of physical ailment. On 17 December, the raiders departed Guadalcanal by ship and arrived back at their home camp on Espiritu Santo on 20 December. At Espiritu Santo, the unit continued {{to be affected by}} the lingering tropical diseases many had contracted during the Guadalcanal patrol. In the second week of March 1943, the 2ndRaiders were declared unfit for combat duty, although this finding was never announced in an official document. The 2nd Marine Raiders did not participate as a unit in a combat operation until the Bougainville campaign beginning on 1 November 1943. In spite of the high fallout from disease, Carlson's troops generally felt that they had performed well as a unit during the patrol and had accomplished their mission. Cleland E. Early—a lieutenant in Carlson's Company E—described the long Guadalcanal patrol and the effect on his unit: [...] "Enduring the living conditions was worse than the combat. My platoon <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> 30men, one corpsman and one officer. When we came out we had one officer, one corpsman, and 18enlisted, all of whom had malaria, worms, diarrhea, jungle rot and high morale.|$|E

500|$|For {{the first}} time since 1993's Vs., the band members did not go into the {{recording}} sessions with any completed songs, only guitar riffs. Vedder admitted that the band [...] "really <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> nothing." [...] The band sat around playing music together and discussed the song arrangements, and in just one week had completed ten songs. Ament described it as a [...] "real collaborative effort," [...] and Vedder described it as [...] "absolute democracy." [...] Guitarist Mike McCready stated that the band members were feeling [...] "fresh and energetic" [...] and [...] "were communicating better than ever." [...] Toward the end of the sessions it came down to Vedder to finish up the material, with Ament observing that [...] "the way the record started and the way that it finished is probably two different things." [...] Regarding his lyric writing process, Vedder said that he wrote at least four different sets of lyrics for each song, with many going as high as eight. Vedder described as a process that demands [...] "the patience of like a National Geographic photographer sitting underneath the bush in a tent", adding he would at times [...] "figure out after eight, nine or eleven drafts that the first one was actually the one". A total of 25 songs were written before coming down to the 13 on the final track listing. Outtakes include [...] "The Forest", later featured on Ament's 2008 solo album Tone, and [...] "Of the Earth", which started being played live in 2010.|$|E

[...] Rabbi Nehemiah, however, said that Pharaoh alone survived, teaching that [...] speaks of Pharaoh when it says, [...] "But in very deed for this cause have I made you to stand." [...] And some taught that later on Pharaoh went down and was drowned, as [...] says, [...] "For the horses of Pharaoh <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{magazine}} hired Robert Capa, {{the distinguished}} war photographer. A veteran of Collier's magazine, Capa accompanied {{the first wave}} of the D-Day invasion in Normandy, France, on June 6, 1944. A mishap at the Life photography darkroom ruined dozens of Capa's photos which he had taken during the beach landing. [...] The magazine wrote in the captions that the photos were fuzzy because Capa's hands were shaking. He denied it, and later poked fun at Life by titling his war memoir Slightly Out of Focus (1947). In 1954, Capa was killed after stepping on a landmine, while working for the magazine covering the First Indochina War. Life photographer Bob Landry also <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the first wave at D-Day, [...] "but all of Landry's film was lost, and his shoes to boot." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{allocation}} of gliders does not correspond with the expected casualties {{for the mission}} of thirty per cent, suggested by the planners before they left Tunisia. The six gliders of the 181st, were loaded with two jeeps, a two stretcher trailer, two handcarts and three folding airborne bicycles and what medical stores they could take was in [...] man portable packs.

The commanding officer Lieutenant-Colonel Warrack, the Regimental Sergeant Major and an orderly were able to go with brigade headquarters. In total only seventy-two from their establishment of 234 men were to go on the mission.|$|E
2500|$|Stevens soon {{gained a}} {{reputation}} as an active prosecutor who vigorously prosecuted violations of federal and territorial liquor, drug, and prostitution laws, characterized by Fairbanks area homesteader Niilo Koponen (who later served in the Alaska State House of Representatives from 1982–1991) as [...] "this rough tough shorty of a district attorney {{who was going to}} crush crime." [...] Stevens sometimes accompanied U.S. Marshals on raids. As recounted years later by Justice Jay Rabinowitz, [...] "U.S. marshals <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> Tommy guns and Ted led the charge, smoking a stogie and with six guns on his hips." [...] However, Stevens himself has said the colorful stories spread about him as a pistol-packing D.A. were greatly exaggerated, and recalled only one incident when he carried a gun: on a vice raid to the town of Big Delta about [...] southeast of Fairbanks, he carried a holstered gun on a marshal's suggestion.|$|E
2500|$|On 7 November 1938 the {{squadron}} saw another role change {{as it was}} transferred to RAF Coastal Command and became a general reconnaissance squadron flying on Anson Mk.Is. In April 1941 these were replaced with Blenheim Mk.IVs which {{the squadron}} used till November 1941, when Lockheed Hudsons took their place. Some of 500 squadron ground crew, <b>went</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> {{the first wave of}} Operation Torch on 7 November, to secure beachheads and airfields around Arzeu, North Africa. Later, from December 1943, the squadron's Hudsons began to be replaced with Lockheed Ventura Mk.Vs. This process continued until the squadron was completely equipped with them in April 1944. In September 1943, a Special Detachment of RAF 500 squadron was flown into Ghisonaccia, Corsica over several days while the Nazis were still on the island with the orders [...] "to establish squatters rights". The squadron later operated up through Italy. It was briefly disbanded on 11 July 1944, but reformed soon after, handing over their Venturas to No. 27 Squadron SAAF.|$|E
