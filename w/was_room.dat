5|$|Because amateur botany {{was popular}} in Britain {{during the second}} half of the eighteenth century, The Botanic Garden, despite its initial high cost, was a bestseller. In 1799 it was in a fourth edition as The Botanic Garden; A Poem in Two Parts at a smaller and more {{affordable}} octavo size, and this was another best-seller. There were three early Irish editions, and a second American edition had appeared by 1807. Despite the huge demand in 1799 and into the early 1800s, and cheaper pirated American and Irish imports, there <b>was</b> <b>room</b> in the market for another edition in Britain 1824 with a reprinting in 1825.|$|E
5|$|Christians {{believed}} in a bodily {{resurrection of the}} dead at the Second Coming of Christ, and the Catholic Church only relaxed its opposition to cremation in 1963. Although mass ossuaries have also been used, burial {{has always been the}} preferred Christian tradition, at least until recent times. Burial was, for as long as there <b>was</b> <b>room,</b> usually in a graveyard adjacent to the church, with a gravestone or horizontal slab, or for the wealthy or important clergy, inside it. Wall tombs in churches strictly include the body itself, often in a sarcophagus, while often the body is buried in a crypt or under the church floor, with a monument on the wall. Persons of importance, especially monarchs, might be buried in a free-standing sarcophagus, perhaps surrounded by an elaborate enclosure using metalwork and sculpture; grandest of all were the shrines of saints, which became the destinations of pilgrimages. The monument to MaximilianI, Holy Roman Emperor in the Hofkirche, Innsbruck took decades to complete, while the tomb of Saint Dominic in Bologna took several centuries to reach its final form.|$|E

25|$|In 1909, the Board of Education {{approved}} Snyder’s {{plans for}} the next section of the school. This group of three buildings, including one {{to the north of}} the tower facing Flatbush Avenue, and two extending east along the northern side of the lot, comprised 31 classrooms, laboratories, study hall, music, drawing, physics, lecture and shop rooms.

However, the first inhabitants settled wherever they liked, taking whatever land they wanted: there <b>was</b> <b>room</b> for everyone. It was only several years later that the East India Company expressed a desire to fix people's property lines so that they could cultivate the land more efficiently. Governor Vauboulon was the first to attempt to organise cultivation of the land and introduced the system of concessions. The first that {{can be found in the}} département archives date to 16 January 1690.|$|E
25|$|Renovations also {{included}} new and refurbished meeting rooms. Existing meeting rooms received new lighting and sound systems, new flooring, and repainted walls. The number of meeting rooms was expanded from 18 to 22, and 15 new meeting rooms {{were created by}} converting the exhibition space below Public Auditorium. The meeting rooms (with one exception) now ranged in size from 100-seat capacity to 650-seat capacity. The largest of the meeting rooms <b>was</b> <b>Room</b> 235, which could seat 1,000 or be divided into four rooms of 200 seats each. New moveable partitions {{were added to the}} Great Hall of the convention center, allowing it to be converted into up to five halls. The cocktail lounge and private bars on the mezzanine were converted into officers of exhibit managers.|$|E
25|$|St. Domingo Methodist New Connexion Chapel {{was opened}} in 1871 in Breckfield Road North, Everton, Liverpool. The chapel took {{its name from}} its {{location}} {{on the corner of}} Breckfield Road North and St. Domingo Vale. St. Domingo related addresses in Everton have their origins in St. Domingo House, a building built in 1758 by West Indies trader and sugar boiler George Campbell who would frequent the Colony of Santo Domingo and later became Mayor of Liverpool (1763). In 1877 Rev. Ben Swift Chambers was appointed Minister of St. Domingo Chapel. He created a cricket team for the youngsters in the area but, as cricket was only played in summer, there <b>was</b> <b>room</b> for another sport during winter. Thus a football club called St. Domingo F.C. was formed in 1878, the club's first match being a 1-0 home victory over Everton Church Club.|$|E

25|$|In 1950, The Chez Show {{originated}} from the Chez Paree nightclub on North Fairbanks in Chicago's Streeterville neighborhood. It {{was one of}} Chicago's top night spots, as celebrities of all genres could be found there, either as performers or as patrons. The original hosts of this weekday late-night interview program were Mike Wallace and his wife, Buff Cobb. In 1951, Jack Eigen (1913-1983) took over as host of the program, a position he held {{for most of the}} next 20 years. After the Chez Paree closed in the spring of 1960 and never re-opened, the program became The Jack Eigen Show and the interviews continued from WMAQ's Studio G, where there <b>was</b> <b>room</b> enough for a small audience, and from Chicago's Sherman House hotel; their College Inn was another popular local venue for entertainment and entertainers.|$|E
25|$|Norwegian Air Shuttle {{established}} a base at Rygge on 14 February 2008, {{with a second}} aircraft being stationed at the airport from 13 March. From February to April, Norwegian Air Shuttle started international flights to Alicante, Athens, Barcelona, Belgrade, Budapest, Istanbul, London, Málaga, Marrakech, Palanga, Szczecin, Valencia, Warsaw, with between two and four weekly services to each destination. In addition, the airline started two daily services to Bergen. Norwegian's services to Belgrade, Istanbul, Marrakech, Szczecin and Valencia were all terminated at Gardermoen {{the same time as}} they opened at Rygge. The airport stated that they had also been approached by Ryanair, who wanted to move the bulk of their services from Torp, but the airport stated that there <b>was</b> <b>room</b> for only one airline, and that they had prioritized Norwegian.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Domenico Ghirlandaio, {{a meticulous}} and {{accurate}} draughtsman {{and one of}} the finest portrait painters of his age, executed two cycles of frescoes for Medici associates in two of Florence's larger churches, the Sassetti Chapel at Santa Trinita and the Tornabuoni Chapel at Santa Maria Novella. In these cycles of the Life of St Francis and the Life of the Virgin Mary and Life of John the Baptist there <b>was</b> <b>room</b> for portraits of patrons and of the patrons' patrons. Thanks to Sassetti's patronage, there is a portrait of the man himself, with his employer, Lorenzo il Magnifico, and Lorenzo's three sons with their tutor, the Humanist poet and philosopher, Agnolo Poliziano. In the Tornabuoni Chapel is another portrait of Poliziano, accompanied by the other influential members of the Platonic Academy including Marsilio Ficino.|$|E

25|$|As a prefecture, Shizuoka had {{historically}} {{been a strong}} footballing area of Japan; in particular being noted for its nationally successful high school teams and the numerous national team players which had emerged from the prefecture over the years. The prefectural police force of Shizuoka actually has an anthropomorphic football as a mascot. The west of the prefecture was already home to the company team of Yamaha Motor Corporation who played in the Japan Soccer League and who would later go on to form Júbilo Iwata, but it was believed there <b>was</b> <b>room</b> for another team for the football-hungry population. An earlier attempt {{had been made in}} the 1970s with the local club belonging to Nippon Light Metal Corp., which briefly competed in the JSL Division 2 under the name Hagoromo Club.

25|$|Tange {{organised}} {{the spaces}} of the three firms by function {{to allow them to}} share common facilities. He stacked these functions vertically according to need, for example, the printing plant is on the ground floor to facilitate access to the street for loading and transportation. He then took all the service functions including elevators, toilets and pipes and grouped them into 16 reinforced concrete cylindrical towers, each with an equal 5 metre diameter. These he placed on a grid into which he inserted the functional group facilities and offices. These inserted elements were conceived of as containers that were independent of the structure and could be arranged flexibly as required. This conceived flexibility distinguished Tange's design from other architects' designs with open floor offices and service cores – such as Kahn's Richards Medical Research Laboratories. Tange deliberately finished the cylindrical towers at different heights to imply that there <b>was</b> <b>room</b> for vertical expansion.|$|E

He also improved the garrison's state of preparation for a fresh siege. The quality of the guns was improved; by 1776 there were 98 pointing north plus two mortars and two howitzers. Another 300 were mounted on the Line Wall and the south front, and there <b>was</b> <b>room</b> for a further 106.

500|$|Balzac mined his {{own life}} for details in the first parts of La Peau de Chagrin, and he likely modeled the protagonist Raphaël de Valentin on himself. Details recounted by Valentin of his impoverished living {{quarters}} are autobiographical allusions to Balzac's earliest days as an author: [...] "Nothing could be uglier than this garret, awaiting its scholar, with its dingy yellow walls and odor of poverty. The roofing fell in a steep slope, {{and the sky was}} visible through chinks in the tiles. There <b>was</b> <b>room</b> for a bed, a table, and a few chairs, and beneath the highest point of the roof my piano could stand." [...] Although they allow for a degree of embellishment, biographers and critics agree that Balzac was drawing from his own experience.|$|E

Votes even went to non-cardinals {{for the first time in}} a conclave since 1503. There was no clear lead as to who might be elected pope, and at one point several cardinals started a fire in the living quarters by accidentally knocking over a lamp while playing cards.
