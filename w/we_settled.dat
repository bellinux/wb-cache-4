500|$|Using the gauze projection-screen, Phillips, Reznor, and Sheridan {{devised a}} [...] "gag" [...] where they {{projected}} [...] "a sheet of glass shattering onto a downstage kabuki scrim that would drop as the glass shatters fell. ... <b>We</b> <b>settled</b> on Trent swinging his guitar at the gauze [...] shattering it, {{but with all}} the pieces falling up as the [...] flew out". [...] This technique {{can be seen in the}} tour documentary Beside You in Time. [...] In contrast to the lighting of previous tours, Performance 2007 featured minimal lighting that was designed to shadow Reznor and the band.|$|E

I thought she should look the same, but the game director made her that way because she had such an experience in Resident Evil 2, she could handle any situation now!" [...] For Revelations 2, the now hardened and aggressive Claire was redesigned to be a contrasting character to the young, immature and easily scared Moira Burton, who {{was defined as a}} purely supporting character, and they both serve different roles in the story and have different functions. Producer Michiteru Okabe said: [...] "Really, only after did we look back and say, 'Oh, I guess they are both girls.' Which is good, because it means we’re treating them as whole characters and not just as their gender. What <b>we</b> <b>settled</b> on is the idea that you have different roles -- it isn’t two against the world, it’s one against the world with a helper." [...] Okabe also said the game's writer Dai Satō [...] "is a big fan of her personally" [...] {{which was one of the}} factors that led to Claire's return.|$|E

2500|$|A planned film {{adaptation}} of the series is unable to proceed because of a lawsuit by Roger Corman, who produced Grand Theft Auto. In 2017, Corman said, [...] "I actually sued the video game manufacturer who flat-out stole the idea. <b>We</b> <b>settled</b> out of court and they gave me some money. I retain the right to remake it, but {{the way it was}} actually written in the contract is a little bit cloudy. My lawyers are actually studying that contract to make certain that I have a clear title to remake my picture, and I will remake Grand Theft Auto." ...|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "Accelerate", Entity FX {{was able}} to create a visual effect of Clark superspeeding through the rain—something Gough and Millar had wanted to see since season one—that {{eventually}} won them a Visual Effects Society award. Gough and Millar had always wanted to see Clark superspeeding through a rain shower, but [...] "the opportunity, [...] money" [...] never presented itself, until now. Entity FX had {{an extended period of time}} to research the kinetics of the cemetery scene, where Clark would speed through rain drops, because there were limited effects done for the episodes [...] "Precipice" [...] and [...] "Witness". Using HoudiniTM, Mat Beck and his team began creating their digital raindrops: [...] "Each raindrop can be thought of as a lens, as a mirror, and an object in itself. The entire backdrop is refracted through it like a lens, and the area behind the camera is being reflected in it. By adjusting those parameters, we were able to give it a brilliant jewel-like magical quality." [...] When trying to decide on the shape of the raindrops, Beck explains: [...] "We figured that round drops weren't that interesting, and teardrop ones looked a little silly and over the top, so <b>we</b> <b>settled</b> on this round diamond shape." [...] Entity FX created [...] "collision events" [...] as Clark ran through the raindrops, breaking them up. Beck remembered watching the cars on the freeway, during a rainstorm, [...] "throwing up these loose trails of spray". Eli Jarra added a similar mist trail to Clark as he ran through the cemetery to give a more realistic effect, although Beck admits to taking a few liberties with the final look of the mist. Occasionally, Mat Beck and his team have to stretch the limits of the realistic physics they try and create when illustrating Clark’s abilities. While creating the alley scene in [...] "Prodigal" [...] where Lucas Luthor is attacked by an assassin with an Uzi 9mm, Mat Beck had to [...] "cheat" [...] the realism on the special effects used. First, the length of the alley is exaggerated in order to create enough time to show Clark stopping the bullets from hitting Lucas. Based on the calculations of how fast an Uzi 9mm fires, and the muzzle velocity, they estimated that the bullets would be approximately twenty to thirty feet apart; four alleys would have been needed for Clark to catch up to all of the bullets in time. Second, the bullets themselves were enlarged so that audiences would be able to see them.|$|E
