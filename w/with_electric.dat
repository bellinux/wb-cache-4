5|$|In 1989, {{seven years}} after his arrest in 1982, Andrew Wilson filed a civil suit against four detectives (including Burge), a former police superintendent, and the City of Chicago.

5|$|Norway is {{a country}} with {{abundance}} of hydroelectricity and NSB saw {{huge amounts of money}} burning up with the imported coal. Plans for electrification of the line is as old as the railway itself, and in 1912 the line from Nesttun to Bergen was proposed electrified and rebuilt to double track, having seen the Thamshavn Line open <b>with</b> <b>electric</b> traction in 1908. During the planning of the Hardanger Line and the Flåm Line during the 30s the suggestion again arose, and both the branch lines were built <b>with</b> <b>electric</b> traction, but not the main line. Countersuggestions were raised proposing a conversion to the locomotives running on oil or coal dust. In 1939 a plan for national electrification was launched, and the Voss Line was top priority. But the breakout of World War II set the plans back, and not until the 50s was it again possible to afford such investments. Vossebanen took electric traction into use on 2 July 1954.|$|E
5|$|Railways were {{privately owned}} and operated, until the Colonial Government {{established}} the vertically integrated Victorian Railways in 1883.

Passenger services today are operated by Metro Trains Melbourne in suburban Melbourne <b>with</b> <b>electric</b> multiple units, and V/Line in regional Victoria with diesel trains. Freight services are operated by Aurizon (interstate), Pacific National and SCT Logistics (interstate and intrastate), and Qube Logistics and TransVolution (intrastate).|$|E

5|$|The Savoy Hotel, {{designed}} by the architect Thomas Edward Collcutt, opened in 1889. Financed by profits from The Mikado, {{it was the first}} hotel lit by electric lights and the first <b>with</b> <b>electric</b> lifts. In the 1890s, under its famous manager, César Ritz, and chef Auguste Escoffier, it became a well-known luxury hotel and would generate more income and contribute more to the D'Oyly Carte fortunes than any other enterprise, including the opera companies. Carte later acquired and refurbished Claridge's (1893), The Grand Hotel in Rome (1896), Simpson's-in-the-Strand (1898) and The Berkeley (1900).|$|E
5|$|There were {{experimental}} test operations {{set up to}} see if {{the idea}} was feasible; however, the technology of electrical systems and power grid infrastructures were inadequate in the nineteenth-century to operate such a system. Another disadvantage was the possibility of power loss caused by wire breaks or electrical equipment failures – which often happened during storms. The nineteenth-century idea to replace the existing steam fire engines <b>with</b> <b>electric</b> ones was ahead of its time and never moved forward.|$|E
5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and consumption is key for high self consumption, {{and should be}} considered when deciding where to install solar power and how to dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks <b>with</b> <b>electric</b> heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E

5|$|A second KKS {{line was}} opened on 27 March 1900, from Nybrua, {{located on the}} KSS's Grünerløkka–Torshov Line, via Trondheimsveien to Rodeløkka. Named the Rodeløkka Line, the {{southern}} section would later {{become part of the}} Sinsen Line. From Nybrua to the city centre, KSS track was used. The depot was located at Rodeløkka. A third line opened on 28 August 1900, from Tollbugaten in the city centre southwards to Festningsbryggen at Vippetangen—the Vippetangen Line. Again, KSS track was needed to connect the line into the city centre. Twenty cars and twelve trailers were bought from Busch <b>with</b> <b>electric</b> components delivered from Schuk—stock that remained in service until 1967. The company failed to make any profits, and was sold to KSS in 1905.|$|E
5|$|Also {{announced}} in November 1896 was {{a bill to}} be presented by the District Railway (DR) for a tube railway to be constructed beneath its existing sub-surface line between Gloucester Road and Mansion House stations. The DR operated a steam railway, running in cut and cover tunnels, and planned to ease congestion along its heavily used route by constructing an express line with just a single intermediate station at Charing Cross (now Embankment). The express line was to surface west of Gloucester Road and connect to the DR's existing line at Earl's Court. Since, like the B, the DR's deep tube line would be operated <b>with</b> <b>electric</b> trains, the DR planned to build a generating station adjacent to its Walham Green station (now Fulham Broadway). The bill received assent on 6 August 1897 as the Metropolitan District Railway Act, 1897.|$|E
5|$|During {{their brief}} existence, Wicked Lester {{performed}} in public twice. The first show {{took place at}} the Rivoli Theatre in South Fallsburg, New York on April 23, 1971. The second, in late summer 1971, was at an Atlantic City, New Jersey hotel hosting a B'nai B'rith Youth Organization event. Not long after that show, the band suffered a major setback when they had all of their musical gear stolen. After a chance meeting <b>with</b> <b>Electric</b> Lady Studios engineer Ron Johnsen, Wicked Lester was given the opportunity to record some demos in late 1971. Johnsen, who produced the demo tape, shopped it to a few labels, with no success. Eventually the tape was screened by Epic Records, who purchased the masters and agreed to fund the recording of a full album. One of the conditions, however, was that Stephen Coronel be fired and replaced with a better guitarist.|$|E
