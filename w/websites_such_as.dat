5|$|Batman & Robin was {{released}} on June 20, 1997 in North America, earning $42,872,605 in its opening weekend, making it the third-highest opening weekend of 1997. The film declined by 63% in its second week. Batman & Robin faced early competition with Face/Off and Hercules. Schumacher blamed it on yellow journalism started by Harry Knowles of Ain't It Cool News and other film <b>websites</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Dark Horizons. The film went on to gross $107.3 million in North America and $130.9 million internationally, coming to a worldwide total of $238.2 million.

The added element of motion controls for the Werehog sections, {{as well as}} text-based hub worlds and better Werehog level design and camera system, were reasons cited for the higher review scores for the Wii version of the game, though a few review <b>websites,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> 1UP, gave the Wii version a lower score than its Xbox 360 and PS3 counterparts. Nevertheless, the game was a commercial success and sold 2.45 million units combined making it Sega's third best selling game during their last fiscal year period of 2008.|$|E

5|$|Video game walkthroughs were {{originally}} included in video game magazines or on text-bulletin boards.

5|$|Jonathan Nolan {{designed}} the film's official website. As with the marketing strategy of The Blair Witch Project, the website {{was intended to}} provide further clues and hints to the story, while not providing any concrete information. After a short intro on the website, the viewer is shown a newspaper clipping detailing Leonard's murder of Teddy. Clicking on highlighted words in the article leads to more material describing the film, including Leonard's notes and photographs as well as police reports. The filmmakers employed another tactic by sending out Polaroid pictures to random people, depicting a bloody and shirtless Leonard pointing at an unmarked spot on his chest. Since Newmarket distributed the film themselves, Christopher Nolan edited the film's trailers himself. Sold to inexpensive cable-TV channels like Bravo and A, and <b>websites</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Yahoo and MSN, the trailers were key to the film gaining widespread public notice.|$|E
5|$|The {{cancellation}} of Enterprise was protested by {{fans of the}} series. Actions included around a hundred fans picketing the gates of Paramount Studios.

The website sought to raise $32 million to pay for a full fifth season of the show, but failed to get close only gaining some $87,000 from general donors plus $3 million of anonymous donations from investors who work in the American spaceflight industry. Rallies were also held elsewhere around the world, and a full page advertisement supporting the show was taken out in the Los Angeles Times. The money was refunded after an unsuccessful campaign, with reportedly only one accidental contact between TrekUnited and Paramount.|$|E

5|$|<b>Websites</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Equestria Daily and Ponychan {{were created}} for fans to share artwork, stories, music, and {{news about the}} show. Founded in January 2011, Equestria Daily had over 36 million pageviews in its first 9 months, and has since surpassed 500 million views (June 2014). The blog, which {{receives}} more than 175,000 visits a day and is fully funded by advertising revenue, was established by 23-year-old college student Shaun Scotellaro {{for the purpose of}} collecting fan fiction and news specific to Friendship Is Magic. Shaun eventually cut back on his community college classes in order to continue running the site out of his parents' house in Glendale, Arizona, when it grew in popularity. He believed the show needed a unified fan base at the time, as there existed an overarching concern that Hasbro would not be authorizing a second season.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{initiation}} of the C-SPAN Video Library, <b>websites</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Metavid and voterwatch.org hosted House and Senate video records, however C-SPAN contested Metavid's usage of C-SPAN copyrighted footage. The result was Metavid's removal of portions of the archive produced with C-SPAN's cameras, while preserving its archive of government-produced content. C-SPAN also engaged in actions to stop parties from making unauthorized uses of its content online, including its video of House and Senate proceedings. Most notably, in May 2006, C-SPAN requested the removal of Stephen Colbert's performance at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner from YouTube. After concerns by some webloggers, C-SPAN gave permission for Google Video to host the full event. On March 7, 2007 C-SPAN liberalized its copyright policy for current, future, and past coverage of any official events sponsored by Congress and any federal agency and now allows for attributed non-commercial copying, sharing, and posting of C-SPAN video on the Internet, excluding re-syndication of live video streams. The new policy {{did not affect the}} public's right to use the public domain video coverage of the floor proceedings of the U.S. House and Senate.|$|E

30|$|In this research, {{the role}} of consumer’s gender is explored. In {{accordance}} with prior literature [3, 6, 40], female consumers {{are thought to be}} more receptive to social and hedonistic aspects of website interfaces, than their male counterparts. Dittmar et al. [40] notes that male consumers focus more on the utilitarian and functional aspects of shopping whereas, female consumers focus more on social-experiential, identity-related, and emotional involvements. The findings by Cyr et al. [3] supports this notion; it was shown that most of the open-ended comments by male consumers were related to utilitarian aspects of the <b>website</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> information adequacy and security features. In contrast, female consumers expressed opinions about the emotional and social tones of the <b>website,</b> <b>such</b> <b>as,</b> “friendliness”, “vibrancy”, and “curiosity”.|$|R
