5|$|The same {{applies to}} herbivores, animals that eat plants, {{and the plants}} that they eat.

In areas <b>where</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> squirrels, the lodgepole's cones are heavier, and have fewer seeds and thinner scales, {{making it more difficult}} for squirrels to get at the seeds. Conversely, <b>where</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> crossbills but no squirrels, the cones are lighter in construction, but have thicker scales, making it more difficult for crossbills to get at the seeds.
