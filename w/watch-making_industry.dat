2500|$|Pforzheim (...) {{is a city}} {{of nearly}} 120,000 {{inhabitants}} in the federal state of Baden-Württemberg, in the southwest of Germany. It is known for its jewelry and <b>watch-making</b> <b>industry,</b> and as such has gained the nickname [...] "Goldstadt" [...] ("Golden City"). With an area of , it is situated between the cities of Stuttgart and Karlsruhe at the confluence of three rivers (Enz, Nagold and Würm). It marks the frontier between Baden and Württemberg, being located on Baden territory. From 1535 to 1565, it was the home to the Margraves of Baden-Pforzheim.|$|E
2500|$|Pforzheim is {{historically}} an important jewelry and watch-making centre in Germany. Due to this reason, Pforzheim is nicknamed as Golden City. Jewelry and <b>watch-making</b> <b>industry</b> is first {{set up by}} Jean François Autran after receiving an edict from then overlord Margrave Karl Friedrich von Baden. [...] This enterprise is later joined by other commercial enterprises and helped Pforzheim to become an important manufacturing city. Pforzheim accounts for just under 70 {{percent of the total}} sales of the German jewelry and silverware industry and around 80 percent of all the pieces of jewelry exported by Germany come from Pforzheim.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{a smaller}} {{fraction}} of the economy nowadays is dedicated to producing the traditional products of watches and jewellery. Only 11,000 people are employed in the jewelry and <b>watch-making</b> <b>industries.</b> [...] Two thirds of all employment positions are made available {{in the areas of}} metal processing, dental industry electronics and electro-technology. The mail order companies (Bader, Klingel, Wenz) with their sales volumes in the order of millions of Euros occupies a leading position in Germany. Tourism is gaining importance. In this respect the city benefits from its favorable Three-Valleys location at the gateway to the Black Forest, and related to this, from the starting points {{of a large number of}} hiking, cycling and waterway routes. The European long-distance trail E1 passes through Pforzheim. It is also the starting point of the Black Forest Hiking Routes Westweg, Mittelweg and Ostweg.|$|R
5000|$|Despite these {{dramatic}} advancements, the Swiss hesitated in embracing quartz watches. At the time, Swiss mechanical watches dominated world markets. In addition, {{excellence in}} watchmaking {{was a large}} component of Swiss national identity. From their position of market strength, and with a national watch industry organized broadly and deeply to foster mechanical watches, many in Switzerland thought that moving into electronic watches was unnecessary. Others outside of Switzerland, however, saw the advantage and further developed the technology, and by 1978 quartz watches overtook mechanical watches in popularity, plunging the Swiss watch industry into crisis {{while at the same}} time strengthening both the Japanese and American watch industries. This period of time was marked by a lack of innovation in Switzerland at the same time that the <b>watch-making</b> <b>industries</b> of other nations were taking full advantage of emerging technologies, specifically quartz watch technology, hence the term [...] "quartz crisis".|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the German <b>watch-making</b> <b>industry</b> {{primarily}} used movements manufactured in Switzerland. To help the German <b>watch-making</b> <b>industry</b> become independent of these Swiss movement manufacturers, DUROWE {{was founded in}} 1933 by Erich Lacher. Erich {{was the son of}} Frieda Lacher, the co-founder of the German watch maker Lacher & Co ("LACO").|$|E

5000|$|Nové Město {{became the}} seat of a {{district}} after the administrative reform of the Austrian Empire in mid-19th century. A post office was opened in 1850. Textile mills were founded {{before the end of}} the century, followed after 1950 by a factory building construction machinery and a <b>watch-making</b> factory. The <b>industries</b> and the entire town changed substantially after 1990.|$|R
60|$|In {{deciding}} on the districts to be investigated, {{it was important}} to choose well-marked specimens of urban and rural populations. In the former, a town was wanted where there were various industries, and where the population was not increasing. A town where only one industry was pursued would not be a fair sample, because the particular industry might be suspected of having a special influence, and a town that was increasing would have attracted numerous immigrants from the country, who are undistinguishable as such in the census returns. Guided by these considerations, I selected Coventry, where silk weaving, <b>watch-making,</b> and other <b>industries</b> are carried on, and whose population had scarcely varied during the decade preceding the census of 1871.[25] It is an open town, in which the crowded alleys of larger places are not frequent. Its urban peculiarities are therefore minimised, and its statistical returns would give a picture somewhat too favourable of the average condition of life in towns. For specimens of rural districts, I chose small agricultural parishes in Warwickshire.|$|R
40|$| {{about current}} language-problems in Switzerland. These were {{examined}} {{from every angle}} by a committee of experts. It concluded that Raeto- Romansch was in its death-throes and that even the Italian language was not beyond danger. In addition, the experts claimed that the rapid advance of English and also the Mundartwelle – the penetration of the media, {{and to some extent}} also the domain of the written word, by Swiss German dialect – marked a trend that put the Swiss national identity in jeopardy: four-language Switzerland was in danger of becoming two-and-a-halflanguage Switzerland. This may have meant the reduction of Italian to internal use, alongside German and French, or the prospect of English becoming the language of V V communication between Swiss people of differing language-groups who had only rudimentary knowledge of another national language besides their own. However, the extensive debates and parliamentary deliberations about the language clause then revealed how complex and fraught with contradiction was the task of balancing differing – indeed, opposing – principles for preserving linguistic harmony in Switzerland. Anyone who is familiar with this great national challenge – which is far from being finally resolved – will take care not to go around hawking multilingual Switzerland as a readymade blueprint for solving nationality conflicts. The revised language clause, which was eventually adopted in a referendum in 1996, leaves almost everything as it was. Since it is impossible to ignore the way in which Switzerland came into being, or its democratic institutions, or its political culture, geared to compromise and balance, any attempt to distil a few "inexpensive" remedies from it, for use on differently configured situations, is precluded. To this extent, the question in my title must be answered in the negative. None the less, study of Switzerland, and a knowledge of the country, will provide some helpful stimuli and pointers for the international debate about nationalism. The most important of these are probably the following: – Where religious, territorial-cum-cantonal, and ethnic affiliations are not congruent, but cut across each other in multiple ways, the ethnic majority–minority dividing-line is broken; this puts almost every grouping (depending on the constellation) in a minority in the political decision-making process; it creates pressure to enter into comparatively flexible compromises and coalitions and arouses the expectation that the majority – which the party concerned may well form part of on the next occasion – will take political account of others. – A comparatively well-developed form of federalism, which guarantees a high degree of individual self-government and democratic participation, can weaken the pull of the nationality-principle, especially when the neighbouring nation-states are extremely centralistically structured. – Combined with extensive power-sharing, the very marked ideological handing-down of historical particularisms and heterogeneous peculiarities {{within the framework of the}} whole helps prevent democracy from being reduced to the majority principle, and the majority culture from being asserted to the detriment of the others. Switzerland has developed numerous forms of over-representation and active economic and cultural support for minorities as a way of ensuring their integration. – Switzerland’s concordance-based democracy differs not just from the Westminster model of parliamentary rule, but from many others too, by virtue of its extensive and much-used instruments of direct democracy. The way in which the federal state came into being, the federalist institutions, and the constraints of concordance democracy have generated a political culture which, on every issue, aims at power-sharing. This is articulated not only in the territorial, religious, and ethnic differences; it also shows in the balance of power between cantons, federation, government, and people, which is geared to compromise and coalition, and in social bargaining – as witnessed in the collective labour-agreements in the metal-working and <b>watch-making</b> <b>industries.</b> VI – The territoriality principle, which defines the limits of linguistic freedom in Switzerland, has been one of the major methods by which linguistic harmony has been preserved. But it is no cure-all – as the debate about the revision of the language clause in the constitution revealed. Where the survival of minorities is under threat, the territoriality principle has to be applied in a flexible way. – Last but not least, the cultivation of historically generated cantonal particularisms in the face of national trends towards standardization compelled the Swiss very early on to seek compromises and maintain a liberal and tolerant stance. One dimension of this is the recurrent and challenging experience, known to every Swiss child, of realizing that there are people who, though linguistically different, are unquestionably also part of its own world, and must therefore be respected...|$|R

5000|$|In mediaeval {{times there}} was a lazar house or leper {{hospital}} covering part of the area, which had been founded in 1168 by Hugh de Kevelioc, 5th Earl of Chester, for William D'Auney, a knight who had contracted the condition while following Kevelioc in a crusade. The modern area originates in 1847 when, {{as an extension of}} the neighbouring Spon area, building commenced to accommodate the <b>watch-making</b> <b>industry</b> for which Coventry was then famous; however, the part of Chapelfields from Sir Thomas White's Road to Maudslay Road was not developed until the early 20th century (Sir Thomas White's Road itself was built in 1908 and formed part of the tram route to Broadgate). It is a quirk of this section of Chapelfields that properties there are subject to restrictive covenants forbidding their use as [...] "fried fish shops", which were prevalent in the area at that time. Another popular type of business in Chapelfields has always been the public house. Though fewer in number, there are still eight licensed premises in this tiny area: the Craven Arms, the Chestnut Tree, the Hearsall Inn, the Coombe Abbey Inn, the Craven Club (all in Craven Street), the Maudslay, the Four Provinces (Allesley Old Road, on the corner with Craven Street) and the Nursery Tavern in Lord Street. The last, locally noted as a real ale pub, presumably derives its name from Weare's Nursery, the immediate former occupier of the land upon which Chapelfields was built. Chapelfields pubs no longer extant included the New Inn and the Brewer's Arms in Craven Street, and the Sun Dial in Lord Street.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the extent to which Swiss {{companies}} engage in corporate entrepreneurship. To that end, a case study was undertaken to better understand how corporate entrepreneurship is practiced in the <b>watch-making</b> <b>industry.</b> Using a stratified sampling method, 18 corporate-level managers of Swiss watch manufacturers were interviewed over a 5 -month period to determine their perception of their firm’s entrepreneurial orientation in terms of proactiveness, risk taking, innovativeness, competitive aggressiveness, and autonomy. Findings were mixed. As anticipated, given the conservative nature of Swiss culture and tradition, the executives reflected corporate values that inhibit proactiveness, risk-taking, and competitive aggressiveness. On the positive side, these executives espoused values that support a corporate culture of innovativeness and autonomy reflecting a resurgence of innovativeness in an otherwise mature industry...|$|E
40|$|The Joux Valley (Swiss Jura Mountains) has {{a rather}} unusual history of human occupation, {{characterized}} by tardive but extensive settlement since the Late Middle Ages, {{followed by an}} intensive period of industrial development. To estimate the links between human activities and environmental consequences, sediment cores were retrieved in Lake Joux and submitted to a multiproxy analysis (high-resolution photographs, magnetic susceptibility, density, x-ray fluorescence, grain size, organic geochemistry, 14 C, 210 Pb and 137 Cs dating). The diversity of anthropication phases, defined from historical data, is clearly recognized in the lake archive. The record suggests the region was mainly under climatic influence {{until the end of}} the 13 th century. The growth of settlements in the valley and the associated massive deforestation is recorded by increasing terrestrial inputs, reflecting large-scale soil destabilization, which subsequently persists despite the transition from farming to industrial activities. Autochthonous contributions then dominate the record, both in response to climatic and anthropogenic influences. Construction works conducted at the outlet of the lake affected water flow, sedimentation and aquatic community (macrophytes, ostracods) dynamics. The substantial increase of anthropogenic heavy metals (Fe, Zn, Pb) recorded during the 20 th century could reflect the development of the <b>watch-making</b> <b>industry</b> in the area, as well as the use of leaded gasoline. Historical information facilitated interpretation of the observed paleolimnological evolution in the context of varied coexisting human activities. This study highlights the importance of applying an integrated paleolimnological-historical approach in order to establish clear links between well-defined human activities and their subsequent environmental responses through time...|$|E
