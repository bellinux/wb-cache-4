50|$|Tar {{was used}} as seal for roofing {{shingles}} and tar paper and to seal the hulls of ships and boats. For millennia, wood tar was used to waterproof sails and boats, but today, sails made from inherently waterproof synthetic substances have reduced the demand for tar. Wood tar is still used to seal traditional wooden boats and the roofs of historical shingle-roofed churches, as well as painting exterior walls of log buildings. Tar is also a general disinfectant. Pine tar oil, or wood tar oil, is a pure natural product used for the surface treatment of wooden shingle roofs, boats, buckets, and tubs and in the medicine, soap, and rubber industries. Pine tar has good penetration on the rough wood. An old wood tar oil recipe {{for the treatment of}} wood is one-third each genuine <b>wood</b> tar, balsam <b>turpentine,</b> and boiled or raw linseed oil or Chinese tung oil.|$|R
50|$|On the {{afternoon}} of June 6, 1889, John Back, a Swedish assistant in Victor Clairmont's woodworking shop {{at the corner of}} Front Street (now First Avenue) and Madison Avenue, was heating glue over a gasoline fire. Sometime after 2:15, the glue boiled over, caught fire, and spread to the floors, which were covered by <b>wood</b> chips and <b>turpentine.</b> He tried to put the fire out with water, but that only served to thin the turpentine and spread the fire further. Everyone got out of the building safely, and the fire department got to the fire by 2:45 pm. By that time, there was so much smoke that it was hard to find the source of the fire, and {{by the time it was}} found, the fire was out of control. At first it was assumed to have begun in the paint shop above Clairmont's woodworking shop and the Seattle newspaper erroneously ran this story the next day. The fire quickly spread to the Dietz & Mayer Liquor Store, which exploded; the Crystal Palace Saloon; and the Opera House Saloon. Fueled by immense amounts of alcohol, the entire block from Madison to Marion was on fire.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the common}} {{practice}} of charcoal burning using internal heating of the charged wood by burning {{a part of}} it, all the by-product vapors and gas escapes into the atmosphere as smoke. The by-products can be recovered by passing the off-gases {{through a series of}} water to yield so-called wood vinegar (pyroligneous acid) and the non-condensible wood gas passes on through the condenser and may be burned to provide heat. The wood gas is only usable as fuel and consists typically of 17% methane; 2% hydrogen; 23% carbon monoxide; 38% carbon dioxide; 2% oxygen and 18% nitrogen. It has a gas calorific value of about 10.8 MJoules per m3 (290 BTU/cu.ft.) i.e. about one third the value of natural gas. When deciduous tree woods are subjected to distillation, the products are methanol (wood alcohol) and charcoal. The distillation of pine wood causes Pine tar and pitch to drip away from the wood and leave behind charcoal.

40|$|Fisheries are an {{important}} economic resource globally. The sustainability of fisheries must be maintained to ensure the viability of this resource. Artificial reefs have become increasingly common for use in aiding fisheries as a management strategy. The scientific literature on artificial reefs has debated the effectiveness of artificial reefs in promoting sustainability. Most studies thus far have concentrated on fish populations that are of economic value. It is recognised that more focus is needed on the epibenthic assemblages that grow on the artificial reefs to better understand ecosystem productivity. This thesis examines three basic aspects of epibenthic communities on artificial reefs that are yet to be studied in detail: the effect of reef surface material, exposure to fish predation and surface orientation on epibenthic assemblage development. A new Offshore Artificial Reef (OAR) was deployed 2 km southeast of the south head of Sydney Harbour, Australia in October 2011. Settlement plates made of four different materials (sandstone, Perspex, <b>turpentine</b> <b>wood</b> and steel) were deployed in three orientations (upward facing, downward facing and vertical surfaces) on the OAR. The settlement plates were retrieved after three months {{and the effects of}} surface material and orientation were assessed by census of the epibenthic assemblages. Steel was identified as a less desirable material for the recruitment of sessile invertebrates. <b>Turpentine</b> <b>wood,</b> Perspex and Hawkesbury sandstone surfaces had similar communities and surfaces facing downwards had higher abundances of barnacles. A fish predator exclusion study was also deployed in three orientations on the OAR {{to determine the effects of}} fish predation on epibenthic assemblages. There were no caging artefacts detected during the study. Barnacles were more abundant in the presence of fish predation, suggesting an intermediate trophic interaction potentially involving mesopredators. Barnacles also had rapid recruitment and mortality in the presence of fish predation. This suggests nutrient transfer to higher trophic levels. They were also found to be more abundant on downward facing surfaces and there was greater evidence that they were consumed by mesopredators on vertical surfaces. By incorporating more vertical and downward facing surfaces in artificial reef design, it may be possible to increase productivity but this effect may change with seasons. More work is required to comprehend the function of epibenthic assemblages in artificial reef ecology. It is important that they are incorporated in a whole-ecosystem approach necessary for assessing the productivity of artificial reefs. This thesis provides evidence that reef construction material and surface orientation will strongly influence the development of epibenthic assemblages and that this may have cascading effects for predatory fish. For artificial reefs to continue evolving as an aid to sustainable fisheries, interdisciplinary approaches are necessary to optimise their design for productivity and the support of native biodiversity...|$|R
40|$|The known {{confectionery}} {{spreadable cream}} product category includes well-known cocoa - hazelnut pastes {{as well as}} peanut butter, products that became very popular in the last decades due to their pleasant taste and ease of eating. However, health constraints appeared both hazelnut and peanut are food allergens, while cocoa excites central nervous system (CNS) and on everyday consumption causes dependence. The aim of this work was to characterize the aroma and sensory of an innovative product that belongs to the same confectionery spreadable cream product category. Six spreadable cream prototypes were produced by using sugar, roasted sunflower kernel, carob or cocoa powder, palm or coconut fat and, lecithin. The obtained samples were firstly analyzed by using the nine point hedonic scale test. The volatile compounds profile analysis (“In Tube Extraction” - GC-MS) {{was performed on the}} best samples (in terms of sensory) containing cocoa or carob powder, as well as a control. The main volatile compound of all three samples was pinene (42 - 51 %) which is a characteristic flavor of <b>turpentine,</b> <b>wood.</b> Acetophenone instead (20 - 25 %) gives flavors of almond, floral, sweetish. Benzaldehyde (8. 11 - 9. 73 %) is characteristic for almond flavor with hints of caramel. The study revealed that the analyzed spreadable creams have similar volatile profiles, even if carob and cocoa powder showed different volatile compounds profiles, with the major compound for both being Propanoic acid, 2 -methyl. Thus, with similar taste to cocoa sample, carob-sunflower spreadable cream is an alternative that not include ingredients with allergic potential or CNS stimulants.  </p...|$|R

[...] The scout riding on horseback over the plains west of the [...] Mississippi, he ascends a knoll and sweeps his eyes around; [...] California life, the miner, bearded, dress'd in his rude costume, [...] the stanch California friendship, the sweet air, the graves one [...] in passing meets solitary just aside the horse-path; [...] Down in Texas the cotton-field, the negro-cabins, drivers driving [...] mules or oxen before rude carts, cotton bales piled on banks [...] and wharves; [...] Encircling all, vast-darting up and wide, the American Soul, with [...] equal hemispheres, one Love, one Dilation or Pride; [...] In arriere the peace-talk with the Iroquois the aborigines, the [...] calumet, the pipe of good-will, arbitration, and indorsement, [...] The sachem blowing the smoke first toward the sun and then toward [...] the earth, [...] The drama of the scalp-dance enacted with painted faces and guttural [...] exclamations, [...] The setting out of the war-party, the long and stealthy march, [...] The single file, the swinging hatchets, the surprise and slaughter [...] of enemies; [...] All the acts, scenes, ways, persons, attitudes of these States, [...] reminiscences, institutions, [...] All these States compact, every square mile of these States without [...] excepting a particle; [...] Me pleas'd, rambling in lanes and country fields, Paumanok's fields, [...] Observing the spiral flight of two little yellow butterflies [...] shuffling between each other, ascending high in the air, [...] The darting swallow, the destroyer of insects, the fall traveler [...] southward but returning northward early in the spring, [...] The country boy at the close of the day driving the herd of cows and [...] shouting to them as they loiter to browse by the roadside, [...] The city wharf, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, New [...] Orleans, San Francisco, [...] The departing ships when the sailors heave at the capstan; [...] Evening--me in my room--the setting sun, [...] The setting summer sun shining in my open window, showing the [...] swarm of flies, suspended, balancing in the air in the centre [...] of the room, darting athwart, up and down, casting swift [...] shadows in specks on the opposite wall where the shine is; [...] The athletic American matron speaking in public to crowds of listeners, [...] Males, females, immigrants, combinations, the copiousness, the [...] individuality of the States, each for itself--the moneymakers, [...] Factories, machinery, the mechanical forces, the windlass, lever, [...] pulley, all certainties, [...] The certainty of space, increase, freedom, futurity, [...] In space the sporades, the scatter'd islands, the stars--on the firm [...] earth, the lands, my lands, [...] O lands! all so dear to me--what you are, (whatever it is,) I putting it [...] at random in these songs, become a part of that, whatever it is, [...] Southward there, I screaming, with wings slow flapping, with the [...] myriads of gulls wintering along the coasts of Florida, [...] Otherways there atwixt the banks of the Arkansaw, the Rio Grande, [...] the Nueces, the Brazos, the Tombigbee, the Red River, the [...] Saskatchawan or the Osage, I with the spring waters laughing [...] and skipping and running, [...] Northward, on the sands, on some shallow bay of Paumanok, I with [...] parties of snowy herons wading in the wet to seek worms and [...] aquatic plants, [...] Retreating, triumphantly twittering, the king-bird, from piercing [...] the crow with its bill, for amusement--and I triumphantly twittering, [...] The migrating flock of wild geese alighting in autumn to refresh [...] themselves, the body of the flock feed, the sentinels outside [...] move around with erect heads watching, and are from time to time [...] reliev'd by other sentinels--and I feeding and taking turns [...] with the rest, [...] In Kanadian forests the moose, large as an ox, corner'd by hunters, [...] rising desperately on his hind-feet, and plunging with his [...] fore-feet, the hoofs as sharp as knives--and I, plunging at the [...] hunters, corner'd and desperate, [...] In the Mannahatta, streets, piers, shipping, store-houses, and the [...] countless workmen working in the shops, [...] And I too of the Mannahatta, singing thereof--and no less in myself [...] than the whole of the Mannahatta in itself, [...] Singing the song of These, my ever-united lands--my body no more [...] inevitably united, part to part, and made out of a thousand [...] diverse contributions one identity, any more than my lands [...] are inevitably united and made ONE IDENTITY; [...] Nativities, climates, the grass of the great pastoral Plains, [...] Cities, labors, death, animals, products, war, good and evil--these me, [...] These affording, in all their particulars, the old feuillage to me [...] and to America, how can I do less than pass the clew of the union [...] of them, to afford the like to you?
