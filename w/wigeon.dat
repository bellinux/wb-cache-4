5|$|Over 190 {{species of}} birds have been {{identified}} near the bay, some of which {{use it as a}} feeding ground during their migrations. Waders and wildfowl often over-winter on the reserve. The populations of whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus) and black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa) are internationally important. Significant populations of dunlin (Calidris alpina) and <b>wigeon</b> (Anas penelope) also frequent the bay. In early winter the <b>wigeon</b> select Puccinellia maritima in preference to Agrostis stolonifera and Festuca rubra. Avocets have become regular autumn and winter visitors to the area in recent years, favouring the lower reaches of the River Parrett, and, {{for the first time in}} over 50 years, bred on the reserve in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Black Moshannon Lake and the bogs of the Natural Area are {{especially}} important to the IBA. They serve as a stopover for migratory waterfowl and shorebirds. Waterfowl observed at the park include pied-billed and Slavonian grebes, common loon, American black duck, ruddy duck, blue-winged and green-winged teal, tundra swan, long-tailed duck, hooded and red-breasted merganser, greater and lesser scaup, northern pintail, bufflehead, American <b>wigeon,</b> and northern shoveler.|$|E
5|$|As many as 50,000 pink-footed geese, 13,000 Eurasian <b>wigeon</b> and 7,000 brent geese winter at Holkham, {{making it}} of {{international}} importance for these species. Up to 400 white-fronted geese {{and a few}} tundra bean geese may join the wildfowl flocks, and the odd peregrine falcon, short-eared owl, merlin, marsh harrier or hen harrier may hunt over the fields. The shingle banks and foreshore hold wintering flocks of shore larks, snow buntings and twite, and waders like knots, curlews, dunlins and grey plover probe for invertebrates in the mud flats.|$|E
40|$|Four metabolisability trials on captive <b>Wigeons</b> were {{conducted}} comparing a complete pelleted diet with others where Taraxacum officinalis and Zostera noltii were added. The daily dry matter (DM) intake of <b>Wigeons</b> varied from 54. 4 to 65. 5 g/day {{and the amount}} of nutrients received from the four diets was similar. The nitrogen (N) content of droppings statistically diminished when <b>Wigeons</b> were fed diets containing Zostera noltii. Correlation among cell wall components (CWC) of droppings and that of intakes was always highly significant and positive. The DM metabolisability of the four diets was 42 - 51...|$|R
50|$|The <b>wigeons</b> or widgeons are dabbling {{ducks in}} the genus Mareca.|$|R
50|$|Mareca is a genus or {{subgenus}} of duck in {{the family}} Anatidae that includes the <b>wigeons.</b>|$|R
5|$|Between {{the river}} {{mouth and the}} River Witham, a large expanse of {{saltmarsh}} provides breeding grounds for common redshank, Eurasian oystercatcher and reed bunting in the summer, and Eurasian <b>wigeon,</b> mallard, common shelduck and common teal in the winter. Birds of prey such as hen harrier and merlin feed on the flocks of linnet and twite, while the mudflats support dunlin, whimbrel, and bar-tailed godwit. The Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust have a reserve there, which is next to RSPB Frampton Marsh, a reserve managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.|$|E
5|$|Many {{other species}} and {{subspecies}} {{have been removed}} over the years: Cetti's warbler (in 1976); long-tailed skua (in 1979); common crane and ring-billed gull (in 1987); surf scoter, little egret, European bee-eater, Pallas's warbler and woodchat shrike (in 1990); green-winged teal (in 1992); ring-necked duck, greater short-toed lark and little bunting (in 1993); white-tailed eagle and Kumlien's gull (in 1998); American <b>wigeon,</b> black-crowned night heron and rose-coloured starling (in 2001); and black brant (in 2005).|$|E
5|$|Waterfowl, rails, {{and some}} colonial nesting birds are preyed upon by otters in various areas. Susceptibility {{of these species}} is {{greatest}} during the summer (when waterfowl broods are vulnerable) and autumn. The otters have also been known to catch and consume moulting American <b>wigeon</b> (Mareca americana) and green-winged teal (Anas crecca). Other species of birds found within their diets include: northern pintail (Anas acuta); mallard (Anas platyrhynchos); canvasback (Aythya valisineria); ruddy duck (Oxyura jamaicensis); and the American coot (Fulica americana).|$|E
50|$|The {{area is a}} {{summering}} {{place for}} a number of migratory birds including brent geese, Eurasian <b>wigeons,</b> and the pintails of California.|$|R
5000|$|The marsh is {{man-made}} and is home {{to great}} blue herons, mallards, Canada geese, ring-necked ducks, hooded mergansers, American <b>wigeons,</b> violet-green swallows and red-winged blackbirds.|$|R
50|$|This {{three mile}} {{long stretch of}} inter-tidal mud and {{saltmarsh}} supports internationally important numbers of avocets, and other birds include black-tailed godwits, oystercatechers, marsh harriers, pintails, <b>wigeons</b> and grey plovers.|$|R
5|$|A {{total of}} 260 {{species of birds}} have been recorded, with raptors such as the bald eagle, golden eagle, {{peregrine}} falcon, osprey and several species of hawks residing year round. The harlequin duck is a colorful species of waterfowl found in the lakes and waterways. The great blue heron, tundra swan, Canada goose and American <b>wigeon</b> are species of waterfowl more commonly encountered in the park. Great horned owl, Clark's nutcracker, Steller's jay, pileated woodpecker and cedar waxwing reside in the dense forests along the mountainsides, and in the higher altitudes, the ptarmigan, timberline sparrow and rosy finch {{are the most likely}} to be seen. The Clark's nutcracker is less plentiful than in past years due to the {{decline in the number of}} whitebark pines.|$|E
5|$|Birds are hunted in many {{countries}} around the world. In the developed world, ducks such as mallard, <b>wigeon,</b> shoveler and teal have for centuries been captured by wildfowlers, while pheasants, partridges, grouse, and snipe are among the terrestrial birds that are hunted for sport, generally with guns. In {{other parts of the}} world, traditional subsistence hunting still continues, as in rural Northern Papua, where cassowaries, crowned pigeons, hornbills and megapodes are captured for food. Seabirds such as muttonbirds, penguins and auks have been hunted for food, formerly with sufficient intensity to threaten many populations and to make some, such as the great auk, extinct. Seabird hunting continues at more moderate levels today, for instance with the traditional MƒÅori harvest of sooty shearwater chicks.|$|E
5|$|Several rivers, {{including}} the Parrett, Brue and Washford, drain into the bay. Man-made drainage ditches from the Somerset Levels, {{including the}} River Huntspill, also {{run into the}} bay. The mud flats provide a habitat {{for a wide range}} of flora and fauna. These include some nationally rare plants, beetles and snails. It is particularly important for over-wintering waders and wildfowl, with approximately 190 species recorded including whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), dunlin (Calidris alpina) and <b>wigeon</b> (Anas penelope). Fishing has taken place using shallow boats, known as flatners, and fixed wooden structures for hundreds of years. It was also the last site in England used for 'mudhorse fishing'. There are several small harbours along the coast.|$|E
50|$|Wildfowl numbers peak {{in early}} winter with migrant greylag geese {{roosting}} on the loch. In addition, goldeneyes, mallards, goosanders, <b>wigeons,</b> teals, tufted ducks and great crested grebes {{can also be}} seen.|$|R
5000|$|The closest {{relative}} {{of this species}} is the gadwall, followed by the <b>wigeons.</b> The species {{was assigned to the}} genus Mareca after its previous placement in the genus Anas was found to be paraphyletic in 2017.|$|R
50|$|The {{site has}} four former gravel pits {{which are now}} lakes, {{together}} with areas of grassland, willow woodland and reedbeds. Birds include <b>wigeons,</b> tufted ducks, teals and great crested grebes, and there are insects such as dragonflies and butterflies.|$|R
5|$|Swans {{and geese}} usually start {{to arrive in}} late October. Passage waders in the autumn include red knot, godwit, dunlin, ringed and grey plovers, ruff, common greenshank, spotted redshank, curlew sandpiper and common, wood and green sandpipers. Besides Bewick's swan and flocks of white-fronted geese, large {{waterfowl}} regularly present in the reserve in winter include the Brant goose, pink-footed goose, barnacle goose and Taiga bean goose. The swans tend to fly off {{in the day and}} return to feed in the late afternoon, and another spectacular sight at the end of winter afternoons is the arrival of large flocks of starlings. Smaller wildfowl present in winter include <b>wigeon,</b> Eurasian teal, common pochard, northern pintail, water rail, dunlin, redshank, curlew, golden plover, snipe and ruff.|$|E

50|$|The River Nene {{runs through}} this site, {{which also has}} large areas of open water and grassland. There are nationally {{important}} numbers of goosanders, <b>wigeons</b> and gadwalls in winter, and banded demoiselle damselflies nest on nettles along the river bank.|$|R
5000|$|The gadwall {{was first}} {{described}} by Linnaeus in 1758 in his Systema naturae. DNA {{studies have shown}} that it is a sister species with the falcated duck, and that these two are closely related to the <b>wigeons.</b> There two subspecies: ...|$|R
5|$|Southlake Moor {{is another}} SSSI, which forms {{part of an}} {{extensive}} grazing marsh and ditch system. When conditions in the River Parrett are suitable, the moor can be deliberately flooded in winter by opening a sluice in the river's floodbank. Some 96species of aquatic and bankside vascular plant species have been recorded on Southlake Moor, including the greater water-parsnip (Sium latifolium). When the moor is flooded it can be occupied by large numbers of wildfowl; up to 22,000 <b>wigeon</b> (Anas penelope), 250Bewick's swan (Cygnus bewickii) and good numbers of pochard (Aythya ferina), teal (Anas crecca) and tufted duck (Aythya fuligula). Signs of European otters (Lutra lutra) are regularly seen on the muddy banks of the River Parrett. The ditches {{on the east side}} of the site are populated by palmate newts (Triturus helveticus).|$|E
5|$|Over 300 {{species of}} birds have been sighted in the park {{including}} the calliope hummingbird, the smallest bird species in North America, as well as trumpeter swans, which is North America's largest waterfowl. In addition to trumpeter swans, another 30 species of waterfowl have been recorded including blue-winged teal, common merganser, American <b>wigeon</b> and the colorful but reclusive harlequin duck which is occasionally spotted in Cascade Canyon. Both bald and golden eagles and other birds of prey such as the osprey, red-tailed hawk, American kestrel and occasional sightings of peregrine falcon have been reported. Of the 14 species of owls reported, the most common is the great horned owl, though the boreal owl and great grey owl are also seen occasionally. A dozen species of woodpeckers have been reported, as have a similar number of species of warblers, plovers and gulls. The vocal and gregarious black-billed magpie frequents campgrounds while Steller's jay and Clark's nutcracker {{are found in the}} backcountry. The sage covered plains of Jackson Hole are favored areas for sage grouse, Brewer's sparrow and sage thrashers, while the wetlands are frequented by great blue heron, American white pelican, sandhill crane and on rare occasions it's endangered relative, the whooping crane.|$|E
