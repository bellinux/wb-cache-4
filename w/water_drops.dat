5|$|The electron's {{charge was}} more {{carefully}} {{measured by the}} American physicists Robert Millikan and Harvey Fletcher in their oil-drop experiment of 1909, the results of which were published in 1911. This experiment used an electric field to prevent a charged droplet of oil from falling {{as a result of}} gravity. This device could measure the electric charge from as few as 1–150 ions with an error margin of less than 0.3%. Comparable experiments had been done earlier by Thomson's team, using clouds of charged water droplets generated by electrolysis, and in 1911 by Abram Ioffe, who independently obtained the same result as Millikan using charged microparticles of metals, then published his results in 1913. However, oil drops were more stable than <b>water</b> <b>drops</b> because of their slower evaporation rate, and thus more suited to precise experimentation over longer periods of time.|$|E
5|$|The {{intrinsic}} hydrophobicity of {{a surface}} {{can be enhanced}} by being textured with different length scales of roughness. The red rose takes advantage of this by using a hierarchy of micro- and nanostructures on each petal to provide sufficient roughness for superhydrophobicity. More specifically, each rose petal has a collection of micropapillae {{on the surface and}} each papilla, in turn, has many nanofolds. The term “petal effect” describes the fact that a water droplet on the surface of a rose petal is spherical in shape, but cannot roll off even if the petal is turned upside down. The <b>water</b> <b>drops</b> maintain their spherical shape due to the superhydrophobicity of the petal (contact angle of about 152.4°), but do not roll off because the petal surface has a high adhesive force with water.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the flashover between the electrodes conducted the current by the <b>water</b> <b>drop</b> on insulating surfaces. It causes ageing to the insulator {{and leads to}} deterioration when the insulator is used for over years. In the experiments, epoxy resin with the <b>water</b> <b>drop</b> is tested by using direct current until flashover of 70 kV. Besides that, {{the effect of the}} water volume, the number of the <b>water</b> <b>drop</b> and the <b>water</b> types- tap and aqua water on flashover are investigated. The flashover of tap water grows faster when increases the volume of <b>water</b> <b>drop.</b> The flashover of aqua water does not depend on the volume of <b>water</b> <b>drop.</b> The deformation and elongate of <b>water</b> <b>drop</b> is in the direction of electric field line. The results lead to protect the damage of insulator caused by the humidity and the loss of their efficiency insulators...|$|R

40|$|AbstractConcerning {{the deeper}} {{understanding}} of the mechanisms on fire suppression with multi-component water mist/spray, the dynamical process of a <b>water</b> <b>drop</b> with or without additives impacting upon wood surfaces is preliminarily studied. The initial diameters of the pure <b>water</b> <b>drop</b> and the <b>water</b> <b>drop</b> with NaCl additive are about 2. 4 ± 0. 1 mm, and the diameter of the <b>water</b> <b>drop</b> with AFFF (Aqueous Film-Forming Foam) additive is about 1. 8 ± 0. 1 mm. The drop impact velocities are varied from 1. 13 m/s to 2. 80 m/s. A Photorn FASTCAM high-speed video camera coupled with a Nikon 200 mm micro-lens is used to record the dynamical process of the drop impacting. The results show that the critical impact Weber number of the <b>water</b> <b>drop</b> with additives is obviously larger than that without additives, and the critical impact Weber number increases with decrease of the wood surface roughness. In addition, the current empirical models both on predicting the critical Weber number and the maximum spread factor just partially agree with the experimental results. The current results are limited to the interaction of a single <b>water</b> <b>drop</b> impacting upon a horizontal wood surface...|$|R
5|$|Solitary and slow-moving, the marbled {{electric}} ray may remain motionless for several days at a time. It is more active at night and spends {{much of the day}} buried in sediment with only the eyes and spiracles showing. Consistent with its sluggish nature, the marbled {{electric ray}} has a low blood oxygen carrying capacity and heart rate (10–15 beats/min), and consumes less oxygen than other sharks and rays of similar size. It is highly tolerant of being deprived of oxygen (hypoxia), allowing it to cope with deoxygenated bottom waters or being stranded in small pools by the falling tide. The ray stops breathing entirely when the oxygen partial pressure in the <b>water</b> <b>drops</b> below 10–15 Torr, and can survive such a state for at least five hours. It deals with extreme hypoxia by coupling anaerobic glycolysis to additional energy-producing pathways in its mitochondria, which serves to slow down the accumulation of potentially harmful lactate within its cells.|$|E
5|$|Both asexual {{and sexual}} spores or sporangiospores are often {{actively}} dispersed by forcible ejection from their reproductive structures. This ejection ensures exit of the spores from the reproductive structures {{as well as}} traveling through the air over long distances. Specialized mechanical and physiological mechanisms, as well as spore surface structures (such as hydrophobins), enable efficient spore ejection. For example, {{the structure of the}} spore-bearing cells in some ascomycete species is such that the buildup of substances affecting cell volume and fluid balance enables the explosive discharge of spores into the air. The forcible discharge of single spores termed ballistospores involves formation of a small drop of water (Buller's drop), which upon contact with the spore leads to its projectile release with an initial acceleration of more than 10,000g; the net result is that the spore is ejected 0.01–0.02cm, sufficient distance for it to fall through the gills or pores into the air below. Other fungi, like the puffballs, rely on alternative mechanisms for spore release, such as external mechanical forces. The bird's nest fungi use the force of falling <b>water</b> <b>drops</b> to liberate the spores from cup-shaped fruiting bodies. Another strategy is seen in the stinkhorns, a group of fungi with lively colors and putrid odor that attract insects to disperse their spores.|$|E

40|$|The {{experimental}} {{formation of}} natural gas hydrate on pendant water droplet exposed to natural gas was conducted and visually observed under the pressures from 3. 86 MPa to 6. 05 MPa. The temperature was set at 274. 75 K and 273. 35 K. The diameter of the pendant water droplet was around 4 mm. The nucleation and growth of hydrate film on the pendant <b>water</b> <b>drop</b> exhibited a generalized trend. The film initially generated at {{the boundary between the}} <b>water</b> <b>drop</b> and suspension tube, and afterwards grew laterally and longitudinally {{on the surface of the}} <b>water</b> <b>drop.</b> The phenomenon of the two layers of hydrate films growing on the pendant <b>water</b> <b>drop</b> distinguished from the experiments on the sessile <b>water</b> <b>drop.</b> The effect of the driving force that resulted from the overpressure from the three equilibrium pressure on the hydrate nucleation and growth was investigated. It was found that the elevation of the driving force reduced the nucleation time and shortened the process of the hydrate growth on the pendant <b>water</b> <b>drop.</b> The crystals on the hydrate shell became coarser with the increase of the driving force. The mechanism for the hydrate film formation and growth on static pedant water droplet included four stages, such as nucleation, generation of the hydrate film, growth of the hydrate film, and hydration below the hydrate shell...|$|R

25|$|P. snelleni {{exists in}} {{temperate}} locations, where cold and hot weather conditions can arise. When the temperature becomes hot, as it often does in Japan {{during the summer}} months when the P. snelleni nests are in existence, the paper wasps need to take measures to cool down the nest. Water transport to the nest occurs after the appearance of larvae, and once it starts, it occurs about 10-15 times in succession. <b>Water</b> <b>drops</b> are carried by the wasps and put on the concave nest roof. This aids in cooling the nest. When there is shade over the nest, the wasps move the water and throw it away.|$|E
