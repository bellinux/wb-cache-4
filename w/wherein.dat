5|$|Yajnavalkya {{states that}} there are two paths to attain {{knowledge}}. One path is Pravritti-karma, <b>wherein</b> a person is driven by desire and a craving for rewards, forms his will, and then uses his knowledge to act out his free will. The second path is Nivritti-karma, <b>wherein</b> a person is not driven by desire and does not crave for rewards, but he uses his knowledge in his works in a detached way. The Pravritti-karma path is the cause for suffering and rebirth, while the Nivritti-karma is liberating and practiced by those who want to end suffering and rebirth.|$|E
5|$|ASL is used {{throughout}} Anglo-America. This contrasts with Europe, where {{a variety of}} sign languages are used within the same continent.

5|$|An {{alternate}} pathway of endocytic processing {{had also}} been demonstrated <b>wherein</b> certain proteins like fibrinogen and myoglobin can bind as a whole to MHC-II molecules after they are denatured and their disulfide bonds are reduced (breaking the bond by adding hydrogen atoms across it). The proteases then degrade the exposed regions of the protein-MHC II-complex.|$|E
5|$|Another {{way of life}} of chemotrophs in {{the absence}} of {{possible}} electron acceptors is fermentation, <b>wherein</b> the electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred to oxidised intermediates to generate reduced fermentation products (e.g., lactate, ethanol, hydrogen, butyric acid). Fermentation is possible, because the energy content of the substrates is higher than that of the products, which allows the organisms to synthesise ATP and drive their metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Chapter 10 states {{meditation}} practice perfects one's {{ability to}} concentrate, <b>wherein</b> the object one concentrates on becomes {{the one of}} attachment, of oneness and one feels one's identity with it.

5|$|In September 2017, Morgan and U.S. {{teammate}} Megan Rapinoe {{were the}} first two female players in the United States {{to sign up for}} the Common Goal campaign, created by Juan Mata of Manchester United, <b>wherein</b> players donate 1% of their wages to support soccer-related charities.|$|E
5|$|In {{the tree}} fort, Jake charges {{his cell phone}} and discovers footage that he filmed prior to Finn and him waking up in a jail cell in the Nightosphere; apparently, Marceline had invited Finn and Jake to party in the Nightosphere, <b>wherein</b> she was given a demonic amulet by Hunson, which turned her into a being of pure evil.|$|E
5|$|Intrinsic {{diffusion}} {{occurs on}} a uniform surface (e.g. lacking steps or vacancies) {{such as a}} single terrace, where no adatom traps or sources are present. This regime is often studied using field ion microscopy, <b>wherein</b> the terrace is a sharp sample tip on which an adparticle diffuses. Even {{in the case of}} a clean terrace the process may be influenced by non-uniformity near the edges of the terrace.|$|E
5|$|John Watson {{opened the}} hotel as an {{exclusive}} whites-only hotel, and {{it one of}} the most renowned hotels in the city in those days.

5|$|Lady Denman Drive, a roadway {{atop the}} dam wall, {{provides}} a third road crossing for the lake.

5|$|Sampson felt, in 1995, {{that there}} was not enough {{evidence}} to conclude that Achelousaurus was a direct descendant of Einiosaurus. Unlike Horner, he decided to perform a cladistic analysis to establish a phylogeny. This showed an evolutionary tree <b>wherein</b> Achelousaurus split off between Einiosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus, as Horner had predicted. Contrary to Horner's claim, Styracosaurus albertensis could not have been a direct ancestor, as it was a sister species of Centrosaurus in Sampson's analysis.|$|E
5|$|Size-dependence: {{the rate}} of cluster {{diffusion}} has a strong dependence {{on the size of}} the cluster, with larger cluster size generally corresponding to slower diffusion. This is not, however, a universal trend and it has been shown in some systems that the diffusion rate takes on a periodic tendency <b>wherein</b> some larger clusters diffuse faster than those smaller than them.|$|E
5|$|The Restaurant {{was later}} {{seen as the}} start of a {{movement}} in London <b>wherein</b> high-end restaurants were moved into hotels. This was followed in 1999 by Koffman moving La Tante Claire from its Royal Hospital Road location into The Berkeley hotel. The Restaurant's location in a hotel was thought at the time to have changed the mantra of not eating in a hotel-based restaurant to one where it was more openly acceptable.|$|E

5|$|The biopolymers that {{comprise}} DNA, RNA and (poly)peptides are linear polymers (i.e.: each monomer {{is connected to}} at most two other monomers). The sequence of their monomers effectively encodes information. The transfers of information described by the central dogma ideally are faithful, deterministic transfers, <b>wherein</b> one biopolymer's sequence {{is used as a}} template for the construction of another biopolymer with a sequence that is entirely dependent on the original biopolymer's sequence.|$|E
5|$|The episode's {{title is}} derived from the 1965 Milton Bradley board game for teenage girls, Mystery Date, <b>wherein</b> several female players draw cards to advance to opening a door, hoping to find one of a variety of {{desirable}} male dates on the other side, while simultaneously hoping to avoid the lone undesirable one.
