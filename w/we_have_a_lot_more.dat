Lew instructed the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to expedite the redesign process, though the new bill would not enter circulation until after 2020. Steven Mnuchin, the current U.S. Treasury Secretary, said that he will not commit to putting Tubman on the twenty-dollar bill, explaining [...] "People have been on the bills for a long period of time. This is something we’ll consider; right now <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> important issues to focus on." ...|$|E

We choose between options to determine who we are, to make statements to the world about who we are. People, he argues, have always done so, but the difference with today's situation is that <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> options. In terms of options, comparing the modern world with the post-modern world is like comparing a breeze with a hurricane. The media forces at work since the fifties have contributed to expanding our options greatly, making the self [...] "aware" [...] of the possibilities to be who it deems worth being.|$|E

For those reasons, I've been lucky enough to make history, be the first woman to do many things.

50|$|Although {{the process}} of writing and {{receiving}} studio clearance was much the same as for Charmed novels, Ruditis explains, 'The big difference now... is that with original episodes no longer airing, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> freedom than we did on the novels'. With the Charmed novels, nothing outrageous could occur to distort established continuity. Stories had to take place 'between' episodes, usually {{in the first half of}} a given season. Ruditis notes that while, 'the studio still has to approve the direction we take', no longer does 'everything... have to reset by the end. That alone means that nothing is entirely safe'. Ruditis and Gregory claim they wanted the series to 'grow and evolve' in the new medium, 'expanding upon what worked and what didn't work'. The creators believe it stands out from the Buffy, Angel and Pushing Daisies television-to-comic adaptations because Charmed has a unique focus on the dynamics of family drama.|$|E
5000|$|The PC version keeps {{a lot of}} data {{resident}} whilst you go between areas. We're {{going to}} spool a lot more between the areas. And we're also compressing the data, {{which leads to a}} little bit of degradation on things like animations but it's hardly noticeable at all. It looks almost identical, in terms of the amount of animations and the amount of graphics in the game. But <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> colors on screen. On the PC, they're limited to using one 256-color palette. We're not limited at all, we can use as many palettes as we like. Each texture in the game has its own palette, which means effectively we've got 32,000 colors on screen at once, which gives a lot more vibrancy to the look of the game. We're also using proper transparency. We're going to be doing some lighting effects that they don't have the power to do on the PC.|$|E

5000|$|Articles in the British tabloids The Sun and the Daily Mirror have {{described}} Pattaya as [...] "the world's sex capital", a [...] "modern-day Sodom and Gomorrah". This provoked anger from government officials as high up as Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha. Pol Col Apichai Krobpetch, the Pattaya police superintendent, denied that Pattaya is a sex trade paradise. Upset about the British media's stories, he insisted they were fabricated. [...] "There {{is no such}} thing as prostitution in Pattaya," [...] said Col Apichai. [...] "Where did they get the figure of 27,000 sex workers in Pattaya? Anyone can make up this information....Thai ladies having sex with foreigners is their personal issue. If they like each other, I don't see anything wrong with what they do behind closed doors." [...] In response, Pattaya social worker Surang Janyam, the director of Service Workers IN Group Foundation, said that estimated number of Pattaya prostitutes published in the Daily Mirror is inaccurate: [...] "27,000 sex workers in Pattaya is way too low. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> sex workers than that." ...|$|E
40|$|When {{asked to}} {{identify}} my most underappreciated paper, I prett y much knew right away which one I would write about. But that did not stop me from spending hours examining the Web of Science to see which of my papers were truly ignored — I found one from my early days {{that has never been}} cited, not even by me, not even by my three co-authors, not even a single time. My temptation to cite it here is trumped by the necessity of limiting citations to three; it will therefore remain in oblivion. Instead, the paper that I’ve oft en thought was underappreciated examined how people create and maintain life change by constructing narratives about how and why they changed (Heatherton & Nichols, 1994). In fairness, the paper has been cited about three times per year on average (total citations = 46), so it has not been totally ignored (although at least one recent paper in JPSP on narra-tive life change failed to cite it, so at least those authors support my claim of under-appreciation). Here I describe why I wrote the paper, what we found, the story that we should have emphasized, and why I think <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> to learn about how subjective interpretations are crucial for understanding life change. 01 _Arkin_Chapter_ 01. indd 22 10 / 25 / 2010 5 : 13 : 45 P...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Title: “Lifestyles {{come and}} go but your choices remain…” (“Livsstilar kommer och går, men valen består [...] . ”) Number of Pages: 42 (45 {{including}} enclosures) Author: Jenny Rydqvist Tutor: Göran Svensson Course: Media- and Communication Studies C Period: Autumn term 2007 University: Division of Media and Communication, Department of Information Science, Uppsala University Purpose/Aim: The aim of this essay {{is to make a}} study of how young adults between 19 - 25 years are influenced by commercials. Key Questions: How are students in Uppsala influenced by commercials? Do the commercials influence the consumptionbehaviour? Do the commercials influence the lifestyle? Do the influences of the commercial construct the individual lifestyle? In which extent is it social related? Material/Method: Together with literature studies, a qualitative method has been used with 5 interviews with young adults in the age of 19 - 25 in Uppsala. I have compared these five interviews with earlier results and research. Main Results: I have found out that these young adults don’t want to admit being influenced by commercials even if they know they are. These young adults have also formed consumptionbehaviour after the commercials, which they show in for example their way of shopping and their way of acting afterwards. The lifestyle is social related, but today <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> choices to make. Today we tend to choose different then before, often because of the knowledge we got.

40|$|Firefly is a web {{framework}} for astronomical data archive and visualization {{developed in the}} Infrared Processing and Analysis Center (IPAC). The development started with Spitzer Heritage Archive (SHA), and continued in WISE Image Archive, Planck Image Archive, and other web applications in the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (IRSA) applications. Back in 2008, we {{made the decision to}} use Java/GWT {{framework for}} web client side code. The decision has served us well in last eight years, enabling us to develop and deploy several data access applications in short time frame. Two years ago, IPAC started to develop the Science User Interface and Tools for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). Firefly must meet the needs of archive access and visualization for the 2021 LSST telescope and must serve astronomers beyond the year 2030. We need to take Firefly into the next generation, making it more flexible, stable, maintainable, and reliable. With the evolution of the web, advancement of JavaScript programming, all the web development frameworks based on JavaScript, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>more</b> choices in the web application development technology. After much research and experiments, we decided to rewrite the client side code in JavaScript, adopting React/Redux framework. The work started in late 2015, and by end of July 2016 we could declare that we successfully ported the 150, 000 lines Java code into JavaScript. This talk will give a report on the decision making process, the challenges we faced, the new development process we adopted along the way, and the Firefly improvements we achieved by going to JavaScript...|$|E
