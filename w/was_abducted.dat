5|$|Much of Carter's {{inspiration}} for the episode came from reports of Phineas Gage, who underwent a personality change after a blasting accident drove an iron rod completely through his head (though the idea that Gage became violent, immoral, or a pathological liar, as Scully describes him, is without foundation).
