5|$|Meanwhile, the city's mayoral primary race enters its closing weeks. Royce {{initially}} has {{a seemingly}} insurmountable lead over challengers Tommy Carcetti and Tony Gray, {{with a big}} <b>war</b> <b>chest</b> and major endorsements. Royce's lead begins to fray, however, as his own political machinations turn against him and Carcetti starts to highlight the city's crime problem. Carcetti is propelled to victory in the primary election.|$|E

5|$|Barkley's party loyalty in the governor's race {{made him}} a {{formidable}} candidate to challenge Stanley, who by 1924 had angered members of both party factions, but Barkley {{had spent most of}} his funds in his campaign against Cantrill, and {{he did not want to}} risk his reputation as a party unifier by challenging a Democrat. Instead, he decided to rebuild his <b>war</b> <b>chest</b> to unseat Kentucky's incumbent Republican senator, Richard P. Ernst, in 1926. In the meantime, he refrained from using his influence in state races to avoid losing any goodwill with Kentucky voters.|$|E

The Chicago Tribune endorsed Orbach. Shiller charged that Orbach catered to developers, displacing people {{in the wake of}} rehabilitation that priced housing {{out of the reach of}} many, and said she wanted community zoning boards, with their decisions binding on the alderman. Shiller charged that most of Orbach's campaign <b>war</b> <b>chest</b> was from developers and regular Democrats outside the ward.|$|E
5|$|The Pandurs {{took part}} in War of the Austrian Succession, {{including}} the First Silesian War. They {{took part in}} capturing Zobten am Berge and Strehlen in Lower Silesia from the Prussians, and defending a bridgehead near Vienna after the Battle of Mollwitz. In 1742, the Pandurs took part in capture of Klaus Castle in Styria as well as Linz and Deggendorf, where they defeated French troops before taking part in Austrian recapture of Munich. By {{the end of that}} year, the Pandurs had captured Diessenstein Castle and Cham from Bavarian defenders, completely destroying Cham to secure access for Habsburg troops led by Ludwig Andreas von Khevenhüller to Bohemia. In 1743, the Pandurs led by Trenck captured Cosel fortress. In 1745, during the Second Silesian War, the Pandurs took part in the Battle of Soor, where they looted a Prussian <b>war</b> <b>chest</b> containing 80,000ducats, as well as weapons, horses and a tent belonging to Frederick the Great.|$|E

25|$|To combat Brutus and Cassius, {{who were}} massing an {{enormous}} army in Greece, Antony needed soldiers, the cash from Caesar's <b>war</b> <b>chests,</b> and the legitimacy that Caesar's name would provide for any action he took against them. With {{the passage of}} the lex Titia on 27 November 43 BC, the Second Triumvirate was officially formed, composed of Antony, Octavian, and Caesar's loyal cavalry commander Lepidus.

5|$|Through his Mafia boss allies Magaddino and Gaspar Milazzo, Aiello {{arranged}} {{a meeting with}} Joe Masseria, the capo di tutti capi based in New York City, seeking support in Aiello's efforts against Capone. During the meeting Masseria offered to support Aiello in exchange {{for control of the}} east side of Chicago, which would allow Aiello to keep the city's west side. The offer infuriated Aiello, who threatened Masseria and ordered him to leave the city. In turn, Masseria spread false rumors that Aiello attempted to kill Masseria, giving him a pretext to support Capone in retaliation. Mafioso Joseph Bonanno later described as a key incident in starting the Castellammarese War in New York City. Masseria openly supported Capone, requiring a strong alliance with him following the death of Masseria ally Giuseppe Morello. He also offered territory to Milazzo if he betrayed Aiello, an offer Milazzo rebuffed and considered insulting. As a result, Aiello backed Salvatore Maranzano in the Castellammarese War, providing the Maranzano forces with $5,000 a week for their <b>war</b> <b>chest.</b>|$|E
5|$|In their off-duty hours, SPARS contributed {{time and}} effort to many {{community}} and wartime causes. Some became active nurse's aides, some rolled bandages for the Red Cross, others donated blood to blood banks, some visited service men in convalescent hospitals, and others collected gifts for the men overseas. Many of them were also involved in the March of Dimes campaigns, and <b>war</b> <b>chest</b> and war bond drives. Both officers and enlisted were awarded ribbons and medals based on their service, and some were acknowledged for their outstanding contributions to the SPARS and the country. In general, SPARS looked upon their service favorably, and many of them found a form of kinship in having {{been a part of the}} nation's military forces during wartime. With the surrender of Japan in August 1945, the USCG demobilization effort began, and the SPARS were gradually discharged. They were separated from the service on a point system, and on the basis of their jobs. However, many SPARS were reassigned to the personnel separation centers to help with demobilization (women and men reservists) and they were not separated until it was completed. The Women's Reserve of the USCG (SPARS) was inactivated on 25 July 1947.|$|E
5|$|More than 30,000 {{artifacts}} from Kronan have been salvaged and cataloged, ranging from bronze cannons {{of up to}} four tonnes to small eggshell fragments. There have been several discoveries of considerable importance, and some of unique historical and archaeological value. One of the first finds was a small table cabinet with nine drawers containing navigational instruments, pipe-cleaning tools, cutlery and writing utensils, which most likely belonged {{to one of the}} officers. As a flagship, Kronan carried a large amount of cash in the form of silver coins. Besides wages for the crew, a <b>war</b> <b>chest</b> was required for large, unforeseen expenses. In 1982, a collection of 255 gold coins was found, most of them ducats. The origin of the individual coins varied considerably, with locations such as Cairo, Reval (modern-day Tallinn), and Seville. Another 46 ducats were found in 2000. The coin collection is probably the largest gold treasure ever encountered on Swedish soil, though it was not enough to cover large expenses, which has led to the assumption that they were the personal property of Admiral Lorentz Creutz. In 1989, more than 900 silver coins were found in the remains of the orlop, at the time the largest silver coin collection ever discovered in Sweden. In 2005, a much larger cache of nearly 6,200 coins was uncovered and in 2006 yet another with more than 7,000 coins. The silver treasure of 2005 consisted almost entirely of 4 öre-coins minted in 1675, which represented over 1% of the entire production of 4 öre-coins of that year.|$|E
50|$|Companies can {{redistribute}} their <b>war</b> <b>chests</b> {{to shareholders}} by issuing larger or special dividends, or more commonly through share buyback operations. Companies {{do this because}} if actually held in cash, the companies will be earning a low rate of return in the money markets, whereas they could be using the funds to invest in more profitable projects. If they continue not to invest the funds, shareholders may sell the company's shares and make it vulnerable to a takeover. This would place the current management's jobs at risk.|$|R

40|$|The ousting {{of three}} Iowa Supreme Court Justices has sent shockwaves {{throughout}} the country for all judges, no matter their method of selection and retention. Not only are justices and judges in election states suddenly vulnerable to judicial opponents with large <b>war</b> <b>chests,</b> even those in retention-election states are now vulnerable on issues that may bring players backed by large <b>war</b> <b>chests.</b> Iowa, as a retention-election state, {{was not alone in}} encountering organized efforts to remove justices from state supreme courts. Alaska Justice Dana Fabe squeaked by in her retention election despite anti-abortion/pro-traditional-marriage issue opposition; three justices up for retention in Colorado staved off a redistricting-issue opposition; two Florida justices tied to an issue on federal health-care legislation won with the lowest approval rating ever; in Illinois, Justice Kilbride headed off big money, also over a redistricting decision; and four Kansas justices managed to keep their jobs with the assistance of a full-page campaign ad. In both Iowa and Colorado, the justices did not engage in any campaign activity. In Kansas they did. What was the strategy, if any, used in each of these states by these justices, and why? These are the types of questions that will be addressed in an upcoming AJA seminar and workshop...|$|R

The Government of Singapore Investment Corporation and Temasek Holdings are partially {{the expression of}} a desire to bolster Singapore's standing as an international financial centre.

A credible argument can be made that Jerry Brown’s message resonated, while Whitman was simply {{out of touch with the}} average California voter. On the surface this might be true, but digging deeper into the campaigns reveals another story. Jerry Brown was the beneficiary of over $ 30 million spent by unions on negative advertising against Meg Whitman, highlighting her negatives throughout the election season...|$|R
5000|$|An anti-incumbent super PAC {{called the}} Campaign for Primary Accountability spent $21,000 {{to try to}} unseat Bonner. Bonner told The New York Times that “obviously, when the Supreme Court made their {{decision}} to open up corporate <b>war</b> <b>chests,</b> this is the result." [...] Bonner said he believed he would survive the primary challenge because his campaign expenditures far exceed the money being spent against him. “If I hadn’t had $1 million in my account, I could be underwater right now,” said Bonner. According to Federal Election Commission records, Bonner spent $650,000 on his re-election campaign. His three opponents spent a combined total of under $275,000. No Democratic candidates have filed to run against Bonner in the general election.|$|R

40|$|The {{definition}} of corruption currently {{used by the}} United States judicial system for congresspeople is very stringent, requiring full knowledge of exchanging money for legislative favors in order to convict. However, the increasing amount of outside money in congressional elections suggests that the environment is ripe for {{a quid pro quo}} exchange. This is especially true for incumbents, who have an established, built-in advantage favoring reelection and receive the majority of outside spending. To investigate whether there exists the potential for a quid pro quo, I look at incumbents fundraising and expenditure data in 2010 and 2014, after the Supreme Court’s Citizens United decision. I find that incumbents strategically take advantage of incumbency benefits to build <b>war</b> <b>chests</b> of savings and scare off higher quality challengers. This implies a level of integration with political elites and wealthy donors that suggests a quid pro quo between the two sides...|$|R
40|$|In this appendix, I {{present the}} {{solution}} to the incumbent’s maximization problem. The method is to work backwards through each decision point of the incumbent solving each maximization problem with the Kuhn-Tucker method. One of the insights one obtains is that the incumbent would raise a certain amount if she knew who she was running against. But since she does not know, she raises some “average ” amount. This amount is different than what the incumbent would raise if she knew who she was running against. Finally, I show the comparative statics of <b>war</b> <b>chests</b> and other variables by taking partial derivatives. Because W 1 (s, q) > 0, 1 the incumbent will spend all that she has in the last election: s 2 = r 1 − s 1 + r 2 (recall that subscripts denote the first or second election). Since the probabilities of drawing a particular quality challenger are known by the incumbent, the incumbent’s utility maximization problem is a nested maximization problem: max r 1 ≥...|$|R

The treasury at home was utterly exhausted and extraordinary efforts had been made necessary {{for the protection of the}} Spanish colonies and the plate fleet. Parma then raised forts at Rosendaal, Turnhout and Kempeu to check the incursions of the garrison of Bergen into Brabant.

25|$|Henry, who {{had spent}} the winter in Paris, was awakened {{that night at the}} Louvre and by morning had donned his armour. The {{situation}} was now serious as the road now laid open to Paris across the Somme valley. At the time a peace proposal was being made between France and Spain. Taking back Amiens would afford Henry a major bargaining position whilst at the same time making sure peace was his ultimate objective. In effect the siege of Amiens would decide the war between France and Spain. Despite this however money was short in the French <b>war</b> <b>chest</b> and much dissent was caused amongst Henry's old Huguenot allies many of them refused to join and wanted concessions now that he had become a Catholic. Henry relied heavily on outside resources; money and troops especially from the English. Queen Elizabeth I after much dithering reluctantly agreed to the release of her troops after considering bargaining for Boulogne or an indemnity in money, the latter of which was agreed.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, Dunn {{was invited}} {{to serve on the}} board of {{directors}} of Canada Steamship Lines (CSL), whose ore carriers were an important transporter of ore and coal for the Algoma Steel plant which operated under a geographical disadvantage to its more southerly competitors. Unhappy over CSL's policy of prioritizing service to his steel mill's competition on the lower section of the Great Lakes, with backing from a Winnipeg, Manitoba businessman plus the Montreal publishing magnate, John Wilson McConnell, James Dunn quietly set about buying up shares of the shipping line. He secured a line of credit from the Bank of Montreal and through Earle McLaughlin at the Royal Bank of Canada he raised a <b>war</b> <b>chest</b> that saw him gain effective control of Canada Steamship Lines in 1951. This was followed up by the acquisition of another shipping line with cargo vessels capable of cost-effective delivery of Algoma Steel's products to the southern markets. Within a few years, Dunn was exporting iron ore from his Algoma Ore Properties Limited to American buyers.|$|E
40|$|The global {{imbalances}} {{of the last}} decade were, everyone now realizes, a decidedly mixed blessing. They enabled China and other emerging markets to export their way to higher incomes. They allowed their central banks to protect themselves from capital‐flow volatility by accumulating <b>war</b> <b>chests</b> of foreign reserves. They supported buoyant asset markets and rising consumption in the advanced economies despite what were, in many cases, slowly‐growing or stagnant real wages. By 2004 observers were characterizing this as a happy complementarity of interests – as a stable and socially‐desirable equilibrium that might run for another 10 or 20 years. 2 In hindsight we now know that the prospects were not so happy. 3 Capital inflows fed excesses in U.
