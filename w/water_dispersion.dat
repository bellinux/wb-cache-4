50|$|Phytostabilisation {{is a form}} of {{phytoremediation}} {{that uses}} hyperaccumulator plants for long-term stabilisation and containment of tailings, by sequestering pollutants in soil near the roots. The plant's presence can reduce wind erosion, or the plant's roots can prevent water erosion, immobilise metals by adsorption or accumulation, and provide a zone around the roots where the metals can precipitate and stabilise. Pollutants become less bioavailable and livestock, wildlife, and human exposure is reduced. This approach can be especially useful in dry environments, which are subject to wind and <b>water</b> <b>dispersion.</b>|$|E

50|$|Phytophthora kernoviae {{can survive}} as an oospore, a thick walled resting {{structure}} {{and has been}} found to survive on infected plant tissues and in soil. Chlamydospores, long term resting structures that are seen in Phytophthora ramorum and other Phytophthora species are not observed in Phytophthora kernoviae. Production of sporangia, oospores, and zoospores were observed on Phytophthora kernoviae. Sporangia are only formed on hosts with susceptible foliage, trunk cankers have not exhibited sporulation and do not spread disease. This creates a simple life cycle for Phytophthora kernoviae. Oospores can germinate and create mouse-shaped sporangia. Sporangia serve as dispersal structures and create and release Zoospores, motile infectious spores. Once released, oospores germinate on the host and infect target host tissues. After infection if the conditions are correct, Phytophthora kernoviae produce sporangia that are dislodged by natural occurrences and spread to nearby plant tissue. In lab settings the production of these sporangia are documented within one week, with the sproangia present six days after inoculation causing documented disease in new plant tissues. The sporangia of Phytophthora kernoviae are spread locally through wind and <b>water</b> <b>dispersion,</b> infecting nearby susceptible tissues, long distance travel is occurs through the movement of infected plant tissues and in soil carried on vehicles, animals and footwear.|$|E

30|$|We {{succeeded in}} {{preparing}} size-controlled calpain inhibitor nanocrystals using Nano Spray Dryer B- 90. To {{the best of}} our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} to prepare calpain inhibitor nanocrystals. The particle sizes were associated with the mesh aperture sizes, namely when the mesh aperture sizes decreased, the particle sizes decreased. The concentration of ethanol-dissolved drug solution significantly affected the particle size. Calpain inhibitors will be a promising drug for curing intractable diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Therefore, utilizing the calpain-inhibitor-nanocrystal-based drug delivery system targeting such intractable diseases will be quite attractive topics in the near future, and thus our fundamental findings of preparing calpain inhibitor nanocrystals in this research are noteworthy.

The synthesis procedure was based on a two-step polymerization, namely a <b>water</b> <b>dispersion</b> stage and a suspension polymerization stage. The use of a surfactant with a low HLB value resulted in a more stable water-in-oil system and smaller water droplets.
