5|$|The primary {{formulation}} of Kant's ethics is the categorical imperative, {{from which he}} derived four further formulations. Kant made a distinction between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. A hypothetical imperative is one we must obey {{if we want to}} satisfy our desires: 'go to the doctor' is a hypothetical imperative because <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> obliged to obey it if we want to get well. A categorical imperative binds us regardless of our desires: everyone has a duty to not lie, regardless of circumstances and even if it is in our interest to do so. These imperatives are morally binding because they are based on reason, rather than contingent facts about an agent. Unlike hypothetical imperatives, which bind us insofar as we are part of a group or society which we owe duties to, we cannot opt out of the categorical imperative because we cannot opt out of being rational agents. We owe a duty to rationality by virtue of being rational agents; therefore, rational moral principles apply to all rational agents at all times.|$|E

Vertex cover is therefore fixed-parameter tractable, and if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> interested in small k, we can solve the problem in polynomial time. One algorithmic technique that works here is called bounded search tree algorithm, and its idea is to repeatedly choose some vertex and recursively branch, with two cases at each step: place either the current vertex or all its neighbours into the vertex cover.|$|E
25|$|I {{hope the}} discussions {{outlined}} {{in these pages}} {{have shown that the}} data of anthropology teach us a greater tolerance of forms of civilization different from our own, that we should learn to look on foreign races with greater sympathy and with a conviction that, as all races have contributed in the past to cultural progress in one way or another, so they will be capable of advancing the interests of mankind if <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> willing to give them a fair opportunity.|$|E

500|$|Goffman’s {{key idea}} is that most {{conversation}} is simply a replaying of a strip – {{what he describes as}} a personal experience or event. When we talk with others, the speaker’s goal is often always the same, to provide “evidence for the fairness or unfairness of his current situation and other grounds for sympathy, approval, exoneration, understanding, or amusement. And what his listeners are primarily obliged to do is to show some kind of audience appreciation." [...] Essentially, through interaction, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> looking to be heard, not inspire any kind of action but simply to know that someone listened and understood. This is why often a simple head nod or grunt is accepted as an appropriate response in conversation.|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of the film, PETA objected to the bull running scene in the film and sought support from fans via their Twitter page to ban the film. PETA {{spokesperson}} Poorva Joshipura spoke about the event and said [...] "We will now be contacting the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and Central Board of Film Certification to take action." [...] The film's producer Ritesh Sidhwani, retorted by saying [...] "We had submitted all the papers to the Animal Welfare Board India that stated that none of the animals were injured or hurt in any way and only then, the censor board cleared the movie. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> showing the culture of Spain." [...] Spanish-American artist Charo sent a letter to Zoya Akhtar on behalf of PETA requesting her to remove all the scenes which related to the running of the bulls.|$|E

500|$|In November 2016, Marvel Television and IMAX Corporation {{announced}} Marvel's Inhumans, to {{be produced}} in conjunction with ABC Studios. The series' first two episodes were filmed entirely on IMAX digital cameras, and premiered on IMAX screens on September 1, 2017, for two weeks. ABC will then broadcast the series weekly starting with the first two episodes on September 29, 2017, with the network airing {{of the first two}} episodes featuring exclusive content, outside of the versions screened on IMAX. Select action sequences {{in the rest of the}} series were also shot on IMAX. The series was neither intended to be a reworking of the planned film from Marvel Studios, nor a spin-off from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Ben Sherwood, president of Disney–ABC Television Group, added that [...] "We’ve worked very carefully with our friends at Marvel Studios—and this is a critical point—to make sure that calendar-wise and content-wise <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> enhancing" [...] the MCU; the theatrical debut of the series was timed to not interfere with the release of any Marvel Studios films. In December 2016, Scott Buck was announced as showrunner and executive producer for the series. In February 2017, Anson Mount was cast as Black Bolt. Filming began in March 2017 in Hawaii, and concluded in June.|$|E
500|$|In May 2016, after ABC had {{canceled}} Agent Carter {{and passed}} on Marvel's Most Wanted, ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said that Marvel and ABC were working together, looking [...] "at series {{that would be}} beneficial to both brands" [...] moving forward. In November 2016, Marvel and IMAX Corporation announced Marvel's Inhumans, based on the species of the same name, after a planned film based on the characters {{had been removed from}} Marvel Studios' slate. The first two episodes of the series were set to premiere in IMAX theaters in September 2017 for two weeks, before airing on ABC with the remainder of the series. Ben Sherwood, president of Disney–ABC Television Group, said, [...] "We've worked very carefully with our friends at Marvel Studios—and this is a critical point—to make sure that calendar-wise and content-wise <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>only</b> enhancing" [...] the MCU; the theatrical debut of the series was timed to not interfere with the release of any Marvel Studios films—the theatrical run of the series will take place between the releases of Spider-Man: Homecoming and Thor: Ragnarok. The deal was initially suggested to Marvel by IMAX after they had held a successful IMAX event with Game of Thrones in 2015. Sherwood described it as [...] "a quadruple win—a win for IMAX, a win for Marvel, a win for ABC Studios and a win for ABC to launch a show in an innovative way and get attention" [...] in an increasingly crowded market. Sherwood hoped that this would be the first of [...] "several innovative ways to launch [...] programming." ...|$|E
