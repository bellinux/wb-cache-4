50|$|Of Swiss and Welsh descent, Harris {{was born}} in Port Jervis, New York, and raised {{after the age of}} six in Pittston, Pennsylvania. His father, Thomas, had emigrated from Wales, while his mother, Catherine (Rupp), hailed from Hughestown, near Pittston. His elder brother, Merle, was a minor league second baseman. Bucky Harris left school at age 13 to work at a local colliery, the Butler Mine, as an office boy and, later, a <b>weigh</b> <b>master.</b> In his spare time, Harris played {{basketball}} for the Pittston YMCA team as well as sandlot baseball.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} Lieven de Key around 1597 and is built with Namense steen from Namur, Belgium. It is the only building in Haarlem that was built this way, and was designed in its day as a landmark that befits an authority. The <b>weigh</b> house <b>masters</b> needed {{to be able to}} judge the correct measure of a shipload of grain that was delivered in Haarlem. Inside the large cast iron balance can still be seen. The location of the weigh house was strategically located where the Spaarne river joins the beek, a small canal that according to tradition was used to carry fresh water from the dunes to serve the brewers of Haarlem. Haarlem was known for its beer brewing in the 15th-17th centuries. A large wooden crane operated by wheels driven by manpower was used to hoist the grain on ships into the Waag building and back into other ships or carts for further transport. The wooden crane can be seen on most historic pictures of the Spaarne up until 1872.|$|R
5000|$|She married Nanning Gerbrandsz Borst around 1544. They had 4 children; Guerte, Margriet, Lubbrich, and Gerbrand. After {{the death}} of her husband in 1562 she {{continued}} his business. After her daughter Lubbrecht died, she took the motherless son of her brother Coen into her home, also called Guerte, like her daughter. She was the sister-in-law of Hadrianus Junius and left Haarlem soon after the siege ended. Through him she probably came into contact with the Delft brewer David Jansz, with whom she made a contract in grain trade. Through this trade she heard of a lucrative post in Arnemuiden, which she won; by resolution of 2 September 1574, she became <b>Weighing</b> House <b>Master</b> and Collector of Peat in the city of Arnemuiden. In 1577, she is mentioned in documents as an inhabitant of Leiden [...] "op de vliet". Not long after, she returned to Haarlem, where her son Gerbrand had become an independent shipbuilder. In 1579 her name appears in the shipyard lists, but she was apparently not documented as a returning hero. In fact she went to great trouble in 1585 to receive money from the Haarlem council for wood delivered during the siege that was never paid for. In 1593 some money was paid to her daughters.|$|R
5000|$|Returning to Columbia {{during the}} {{election}} year of 1848, Welsh became active in the local Democratic Party. He supported Democratic presidential nominee Lewis Cass in his race against Welsh's former commanding office Zachary Taylor. He also spoke out against Federal anti-slavery legislation, instead favoring a doctrine of popular sovereignty, which espoused each territory's right to determine its own slavery or anti-slavery laws.Welsh married Annie Young in October 1850. The first of their seven children was born in 1851. [...] He became an enterprising businessman, opening a dry goods store in Columbia's Canal Basin, selling insurance, and operating a small fleet of canal boats which he named after his children. He was appointed <b>weigh</b> <b>master</b> in 1850 and lock superintendent a few years later. He was elected Justice of the Peace and also {{served as president of}} the Borough Council.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{states now}} use {{electronic}} bypass systems (or AVI - Automatic Vehicle Identification) to alleviate {{some of the}} truck traffic through the weigh station. Some {{of the best known}} are PrePass, NORPASS and Drivewyze. The system may consist of equipment at the weigh station itself, as well as a truck mounted transponder or smartphone, usually placed {{on the inside of the}} windshield or on the dashboard. These are similar to transponders used for toll collection. Each transponder is directly registered to a specific truck, and contains a unique identification. The registration process propagates information such as carrier name, unit number, and elected gross weight to weigh stations. In addition, the system keeps a basic safety and compliance record for each vehicle. As a truck approaches a weigh station (approximately one mile before), an electronic [...] "reader" [...] on a boom over the freeway reads the information from the truck transponder. It also looks at the safety and compliance record on the database. A display shows the results to the <b>weigh</b> <b>master,</b> including the speed of the vehicle. The <b>weigh</b> <b>master</b> may have the system automatically determine if a truck needs to stop or may override the system. Approximately one-half to one full mile after passing under the [...] "reader", the truck will pass under another boom which has an electronic unit to send the transponder a signal. If the safety information is acceptable the truck may receive a green light and can continue without entering the weigh station at all. There are weight detecting devices in the roadway itself. A driver may get a red light. On these occasions, the truck must pull into the weigh station for the normal weigh-in procedure. The most common reason a truck is [...] "redlighted" [...] is a weight problem, or a random check. Each time a truck is randomly pulled in, it is noted in the system whether the driver was compliant or not during the check. This affects how often a truck (or different trucks from the same company) are pulled in. For example, a company which is very compliant with the law will probably only have 5% of its trucks [...] "redlighted." ...|$|E
