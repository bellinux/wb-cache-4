The NASA/GSFC Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMe) employed a global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model to simulate the solar wind-magnetosphere interaction during the peak of this geomagnetic storm. Robertson et aL then modeled the expected 50 ft X-ray emission due to solar <b>wind</b> <b>charge</b> exchange with geocoronal neutrals in the dayside cusp and magnetosheath. The locations of the bow shock, magnetopause and cusps were clearly evident in their simulations. Another geomagnetic storm took place on July 14, 2000 (Bastille Day). We again modeled X-ray emission due to solar <b>wind</b> <b>charge</b> exchange, but this time as observed from a moving spacecraft.

The observed line intensity is too strong (11 +/- 2 line unit or photon cm^- 2 s^- 1 str^- 1) to be emitted inside the heavily obscured Galactic disk. It showed a factor of two time variation which shows a significant (~ 4 sigma) correlation with the solar wind O^ 7 + ion flux. The high line intensity and the good time correlation with the solar wind strongly suggests that it originated from geocoronal solar <b>wind</b> <b>charge</b> exchange emission. We discuss the X-ray line intensity considering a line of sight direction and also theoretical distribution models of the neutral hydrogen and solar wind around the Earth.

We obtained contemporaneous data on Comet NEAT Q 4 with the Chandra X-ray Observatory ACIS instrument, marking the first simultaneous EUV and X-ray spectral observations of a comet. The total CHIPS/EUV observing times were 337 ks for Q 4, 234 ks for T 7, and 483 ks for Machholz and for both CHIPS and Chandra we calculate we have captured all the comet flux in the instrument field of view.

40|$|Preliminary {{results from}} an XMM-Newton {{campaign}} to study solar <b>wind</b> <b>charge</b> exchange (SWCX) emission from the heliospheric focusing cone of interstellar helium are presented. The detections of enhanced O VII and O VIII emission from the cone {{are at the}} 2 (sigma) and 4 (sigma) levels. The solar <b>wind</b> <b>charge</b> exchange (SWCX) emission in the heliosphere not associated with distinct objects (e. g., comets and planets including exospheric material in and near Earth s magnetosheath) {{is proportional to the}} flux of the solar wind and the space density of neutral material. The neutral material originates in the interstellar medium (ISM) and passes through the solar system due to the relative motion of the Sun and the ISM. The flow of the neutral material through the solar system is strongly perturbed by the Sun both by gravity and by radiation pressure. Because of the relative radiative scattering cross sections and the effect of solar gravitation the density of interstellar hydrogen near the Sun is reduced while interstellar helium is gravitationally focused. This creates a helium focusing cone downstream of the Sun [e. g., 1, and references therein]...|$|R
