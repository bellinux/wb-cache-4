5|$|Throughout this, Idelba {{has been}} {{secretly}} working on atomic physics {{and she and}} her fellow researchers have made some disturbing discoveries. They conclude that {{it would be possible to}} make a devastating weapon from nuclear chain reactions and fear that the military will try to create such bombs and restart the war. In order to prevent this, Idelba tries desperately to hide all evidence about her research and contacts concerned scientists in other parts of the world. The government learns of her work however and raids the Zawiyya to get hold of her papers, but Budur manages to hide them. Idelba eventually dies of radiation poisoning from the materials she was working with and leaves all her research to Budur, who keeps her secret and eventually manages to organize an international conference of scientists to discuss the nuclear issue. The meeting is held in Isfahan in Iran (one of the few Islamic nations which has prospered since the war) and scientists from all over the world attend. They agree that none of them <b>will</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the creation of nuclear weapons for their respective countries, no matter what pressure they are put under by their governments and also start a new international scientific movement to break down barriers between cultures in a spirit of reconciliation and friendship (they even create a new scientific calendar to be used by the whole world, with its year zero set from the time of the conference).|$|E
5|$|Using ten {{orichalcum}} beads at a {{time would}} enable them to control the water with the powers they gained, keeping the sea level down to prevent an impending catastrophe. Unknowingly, Indiana starts the machine with the stones, upon which Kerner, Ubermann, and the Nazi troops invade the place and announce their intention to use the machine to become gods. The machine was responsible for creating the mutated skeletons seen earlier, but the Nazis believe that it <b>will</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> them due to their Aryan qualities. Ubermann wants to use Jones as a test subject, but Kerner steps onto the platform first, claiming himself to be most suitable for godhood. Just as Ubermann wants to start the machine, Jones mentions Plato's tenfold error, which convinces Kerner to use one bead instead of ten. He is then turned into a horribly deformed and horned creature, and falls into the lava. Indiana is forced to step on the platform next but threatens Ubermann with eternal damnation once he is a god. Fearing his wrath, Ubermann uses the machine on himself, feeding it one hundred beads. He is turned into a green ethereal being, but his form becomes unstable and he flies apart with an agonized scream.|$|E

25|$|Because of {{the high}} level of {{microscopic}} detail that can be achieved by a master engraver, counterfeiting of engraved designs is well-nigh impossible, and modern banknotes are almost always engraved, as are plates for printing money, checks, bonds and other security-sensitive papers.

In the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing, more than one hand engraver <b>will</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> the same plate, making it nearly impossible for one person to duplicate all the engraving on a particular banknote or document.|$|E

Version 5.5 also includes support for 128-bit encryption. Although {{it is no longer}} available for download from Microsoft directly it can also be installed with MSN Explorer 6.0 as msnsetup_full.exe.

500|$|After {{recording}} several vocal {{tracks for}} a possible new Simon & Garfunkel album, Simon decided to adopt it as his own solo album. Garfunkel refused to learn the songs {{in the studio and}} would not give up his longstanding cannabis and cigarette habits despite Simon's requests. An official spokesperson remarked, [...] "Paul simply felt the material he wrote is so close to his own life {{that it had to be}} his own record. Art was hoping to be on the album, but I'm sure there will be other projects that they <b>will</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> together. They are still friends." [...] The material was later released on Simon's 1983 effort Hearts and Bones. Another rift opened between the duo when the lengthy recording of Simon's 1986 album Graceland prevented Garfunkel from working with Roy Halee on a Christmas album. In 1990, the duo was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Garfunkel thanked his partner, calling him [...] "the person who most enriched my life by putting those songs through me," [...] to which Simon responded, [...] "Arthur and I agree about almost nothing. But it's true, I have enriched his life quite a bit." [...] After three songs, the duo left without speaking. In August 1991 Simon staged his own concert in Central Park, which was released a few months later. Art Garfunkel had offered to lend his friend a hand in creating another park reunion in which Simon declined, leading the concert as a solo act.|$|E

500|$|Tittle {{threw the}} ball from a sidearm, almost underhand position, {{something}} novel at those times, though it was common practice in earlier decades. It was this seemingly underhand style that drew the curiosity and admiration of many fans. In tandem with his baldness‚Äîfor which he was frequently {{referred to as the}} [...] "Bald Eagle"‚Äîhe made for a very striking personality. Despite his throwing motion, he had a very strong and accurate arm with a quick release. It was because of his quick release and ability to read defenses that {{he became one of the}} best screen passers in the NFL. He was a perfectionist and highly competitive, and he expected the same of his teammates. He possessed rare leadership and game-planning skills, and played with great enthusiasm even in his later years. [...] "Tittle has the attitude of a high school kid, with the brain of a computer," [...] said Giants teammate Frank Gifford. Baltimore Colts halfback Lenny Moore, when asked in 1963 to compare Tittle and Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, said:I played with Tittle in the Pro Bowl two years ago, and I discovered he's quite a guy... He and John, however, are entirely different types... Tittle is a sort of 'con man' with his players... he comes into a huddle and 'suggests' that maybe this or that <b>will</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> account of something he saw happen on a previous play... The way he puts it, you're convinced it's a good idea and maybe it will work.

500|$|Ani {{has been}} {{listed on the}} [...] by World Monuments Fund (WMF) since 1996. In May 2011 the WMF and the Turkish Ministry of Culture {{launched}} {{what they call a}} conservation project focusing on the cathedral and the nearby Church of the Redeemer. The project is funded by the Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation of the U.S. State Department. Before the project a steel structure was installed around the cathedral, said to prevent its cracked sandstone walls from collapsing. The WMF and its Turkish partner, the NGO Anadolu K√ºlt√ºr, say they <b>will</b> <b>work</b> <b>on</b> [...] "stabilization and protection" [...] of the cathedral. Turkey's Minister of Culture Ertuƒürul G√ºnay stated [...] "We hope that giving new life to the remains of once-splendid buildings, such as the Ani Cathedral and church, will bring new economic opportunities to the region." [...] Armenian officials responded with skepticism. According to Gagik Gyurjyan, president of ICOMOS-Armenia, the Turkish Ministry of Culture rejected the preliminary agreement between Anadolu K√ºlt√ºr and the Armenian side to engage Armenian experts in restoration works. Osman Kavala, president of Anadolu K√ºlt√ºr, stated that the lack of formal bilateral relations between Armenia and Turkey may have prevented Armenian experts from being included in the project. Kavala stated in a 2011 interview that an estimated $1 million would be spent on the project, which was scheduled to start in 2012 and end in 4 years. Yavuz √ñzkaya, an architect who participated in the projects carried out in Ani, stated in March 2014 that studies on preservation and restoration of the cathedral were completed and they had begun to be implemented. These works included clearing the roofs, installing a temporary structure at the separation point between the western and southern walls, strengthening, proper completion of roof tiles and taking preventative measures.|$|E
