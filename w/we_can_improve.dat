There are models out there for how to do it right -- the Mayo Clinic, the Geisinger Clinic in Pennsylvania, the Cleveland Clinic and California's Kaiser Permanente {{are just a few of}} the {{organized}} group practices that are doing a better job for less. Their doctors are better than average at using the best medical evidence available. They're more likely to be using electronic medical records, which can help keep track of patients who have multiple physicians and need complex care. And they're less likely to provide unnecessary care.|$|E

[...] "I don't think this incident exposes any inherent weakness in Wikipedia, {{but it does}} expose a weakness {{that we will be}} working to address", Wales added. He insisted that Wikipedia editors still would be able to remain anonymous if they wished. [...] "We always prefer to give a positive incentive rather than absolute prohibition, so that people can contribute without a lot of hassle", Wales commented. However, he also warned that [...] "It's always inappropriate to try to win an argument by flashing your credentials, and even more so if those credentials are inaccurate." [...] However, Florence Devouard, chair of the Wikimedia Foundation, was not supportive of his credential proposal, saying, [...] "I think what matters is the quality of the content, which <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>improve</b> by enforcing policies such as 'cite your source,' not the quality of credentials showed by an editor." [...] A formal proposal that users claiming to have academic qualifications would have to provide evidence before citing them in content disputes was eventually rejected by the Wikipedia community, like all previous such proposals.|$|E

60|$|We {{fall into}} glib usage of words like {{democracy}} and make fetiches of them without due understanding. Democracy is inferior to autocracy from the aggressively national point of view; {{it is not}} necessarily superior to autocracy as a guarantee of general well-being; it may even turn out to be inferior unless <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>improve</b> it. But democracy is the rising tide; it may be dammed or delayed, but cannot be stopped. It seems to be a law in human nature that where, in any corporate society, the idea of self-government sets foot it refuses to take that foot up again. State after State, copying the American example, has adopted the democratic principle; the world's face is that way set. And civilisation is now so of a pattern that the Western world may be looked on as one State and the process of change therein from autocracy to democracy regarded as though it were taking place in a single old-time country such as Greece or Rome. If throughout Western civilisation we can secure the single democratic principle of government, its single level of State morality in thought and action, we shall be well on our way to unanimity throughout the world; for even in China and Japan the democratic virus is at work. It is my belief that only in a world thus uniform, and freed from the danger of pounce by autocracies, have States any chance to develop the individual conscience to a point which shall make democracy proof against anarchy and themselves proof against dissolution; and only in such a world can a League of Nations to enforce peace succeed.|$|E
6000|$|Thus you see, seignior, added he, {{how far we}} {{are from}} {{improvement}} {{in that part of}} the country which we possess, and many more, which you may be sure are among these vast mountains, and which we never discovered, seeing all these valleys and passages among the mountains, where gold is to be had in such quantities, and with so much ease, that every poor Chilian gathers it up with his hands, and may have as much as he pleases, are all left open, naked, and unregarded, in the possession of the wild mountaineers, who are heathens and savages; and the Spaniards, you see, are so few, and those few so indolent, so slothful, and so satisfied with the gold they get of the Chilians for things of small value in trade, that all this vast treasure lies unregarded by them. Nay, continued he, is it not very strange to observe, that, when for our diversion we come into the hills, and among these places where you see the gold is so easily found, we come, as we call it, a-hunting, and divert ourselves more with shooting wild parrots, or a fawn or two, for which also we ride and run, and make our servants weary themselves more than they would in searching for the gold among the gulleys and holes that the water makes in the rocks, and more than would suffice to find fifty, nay, one hundred times the value in gold! To what purpose, then, should we seek the possession of more countries, who are already possessed of more land than <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>improve,</b> and of more wealth than we know what to do with?

6000|$|Now the Bible, {{it is most}} remarkable, never enlarges {{anywhere}} upon {{even the}} bodily sufferings of our dear and blessed Lord. The evangelists keep a silence on that point which is most lofty, dignified, and delicate. [...] What sad and dreadful things might not St. John, the beloved apostle as he was, have said, if he had chosen, about what he saw and what he felt, as he stood by that cross on Calvary--words which would have stirred to pity the most cruel, and drawn tears from a heart of stone? And yet all he says is, [...] "They crucified Him, and two other with him, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst." [...] He passes it over, as it were, as a thing which he ought not to dwell on; and why should we put words into St. John's mouth {{which he did not}} think fit to put into his own? He wrote by the Spirit of God; and therefore he knew best what to say, and what not to say. Why should we try and say anything more for him? Scripture is perfect. Let us be content with it. The apostles, too, in their Epistles, never dwell on Christ's sufferings. I entreat you to remark this. They never mention His death except in words of cheerfulness and triumph. They seem so full of the glorious fruits of His death, that they have, as it were, no time to speak of the death itself. [...] "Who, for the joy which was set before Him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God." [...] That is the apostles' key-note. For God's sake let it be ours too, unless we fancy that <b>we</b> <b>can</b> <b>improve</b> on Scripture, or that we can feel more for our Lord than St. Paul did. In the Lessons, the Psalms, the Epistle, and Gospel for this day, you find just the same spirit. All except one Psalm are songs of hope, joy, deliverance, triumph. The Collects for this day, which are particularly remarkable, being three in number, and evidently meant to teach us the key-note of Good Friday, make no mention of our Lord's sufferings, save to say that He was CONTENTED, [...] "contented to be betrayed, and given up into the hands of wicked men, and to suffer death upon the cross," [...] but are full of prayers that the glorious fruits of His death may be fulfilled, not only in us and all Christians, but in the very heathen who have not known Him; drawing us away, as it were, from looking too closely upon the cross itself, lest we should forget what the cross meant, what the cross conquered, what the cross gained, for us and mankind.|$|E
