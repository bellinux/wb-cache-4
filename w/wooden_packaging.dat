40|$|Nowadays, {{packaging}} {{assumes a}} fundamental role {{along the entire}} supply chain {{and will continue to}} do so to an even greater extent in years to come. After establishing legitimacy in the 1950 s, packaging today has entered a mature phase and it is at the centre of complex distributional and communicational issues. Packaging systems have also become considerably more important for the minimisation of environmental impact. The present thesis focuses on the aforementioned issues, elaborating on current strategies and methods, as well as presenting new innovative approaches for effective design, management and optimisation of packaging systems. The work begins with a general description of packaging systems, with an analysis of their origin, functions and roles throughout the supply chain. Based on this study, a reference framework for packaging is then developed, defined by five key drivers: marketing, design, logistics, cost and environmental impact. Each driver is examined and studied using different methodologies. An empirical study allows definition of a reference benchmark on packaging, while a case study demonstrates the implementation of the developed approaches in a real industrial setting. Real packaging prototypes are developed, as well as various products that must meet specific needs, starting from cardboard, plastic and <b>wooden</b> <b>packages.</b> Relevant results from both economic and environmental standpoints are presented with regard to the issues surrounding product packaging. Potential for cost reductions and increases in management efficiency of packaging companies are identified. It is shown that the environmental impact of packaging systems may be reduced through their re-use for both similar and very different functions to those for which packaging is traditionally employed: product protection and containment. ...|$|R
40|$|Food {{packaging}} is multifunctional: {{it protects}} from harvest to table. Four main groups of materials for direct food contact are {{mentioned in the}} literature: wood, glass, plastic, and metal. In this review, {{the focus is on}} <b>wooden</b> <b>packaging</b> for direct contact with food. In Europe, wood as a food contact material is subject to European Regulation (EC) No 1935 / 2004 states that materials must not transfer their constituents to food. Today, <b>wooden</b> <b>packaging,</b> like other packaging materials, does not have a Europe-wide harmonized specific regulation, so member countries legislate at different levels. Wood has been safely used for centuries in contact with food but is usually questioned because of its microbiological behavior compared with smooth surfaces. Based on a review of published conclusions from scientific studies over the last 20 y and after a description of the general properties of <b>wooden</b> <b>packaging,</b> we focus on the microbiological status of natural wood. Then, we discuss the parameters influencing the survival of microorganisms on wood. Finally, we report on the transfer of microorganisms from wood to food and the factors influencing this phenomenon. This review demonstrates that the porous nature of wood, especially when compared with smooth surfaces, is not responsible for the limited hygiene of the material used in the food industry and that it may even be an advantage for its microbiological status. In fact, its rough or porous surface often generates unfavorable conditions for microorganisms. In addition, wood has the particular characteristic of producing antimicrobial components able to inhibit or limit the growth of pathogenic microorganisms...|$|E
40|$|Abstract New Zealand {{has three}} species of native {{termites}} Kalotermes brouni, Stolotermes ruficeps and S. inopinus. In terms of destructive capability, these are of minor significance. Invasive Australian subterranean termites, specifically Coptotermes acinaciformis, hitchhiked into New Zealand unnoticed several decades ago, within utility poles, railway sleepers and <b>wooden</b> <b>packaging.</b> From 1940 to 1980, up to 50, 000 {{properties in the}} North Island were inspected for invasive termites, with around 110 infested sites found and treated. One infested site located in the rural town of Otorohanga has persisted. C. acinaciformis was first reported from Otorohanga in 1990, with the termites entering the town during the 1950 s via two imported utility poles. Initial response actions involved removal of the utility poles adjacent to infested properties and insecticide treatment. One nest was found within the poles, and this was destroyed. Further activity was detected between 1994 and 1998, despite treatment carried out after each incident. In 1999 options were explored to eliminate the increasing termite population, which had by now infested eight houses. A group of invited international and local experts met to overview the site and develop a strateg...|$|E
50|$|Originally {{launched}} in 1957 by HB Ice Cream (HB), the Golly Bar is {{an ice cream}} formerly sold exclusively in The Republic of Ireland. It was a single rectangular block of vanilla ice cream on a <b>wooden</b> stick. The <b>packaging</b> of Golly Bars depicted {{an image of a}} Golliwog, a 19th-century caricature of a blackface minstrel. The Golliwog image was removed from the ice creams packaging in 1992. However, continued concern over any references to the image saw a name change to the Giant Bar. Giant Bars remain available for purchase across The Republic of Ireland though reorganisation of the HB brand by corporate parent Unilever saw the production and ownership of the Giant Bar Brand move to UK company Dale Farm.|$|R
5000|$|A {{match is}} a tool for {{starting}} a fire. Typically, modern matches are made of small wooden sticks or stiff paper. One end is coated with a material that can be ignited by frictional heat generated by striking the match against a suitable surface. <b>Wooden</b> matches are <b>packaged</b> in matchboxes, and paper matches are partially cut into rows and stapled into matchbooks. The coated end of a match, known as the match [...] "head", consists of a bead of active ingredients and binder; often coloured for easier inspection. There are two main types of matches: safety matches, which can be struck only against a specially prepared surface, and strike-anywhere matches, for which any suitably frictional surface can be used. Some match-like compositions, known as electric matches, are ignited electrically rather than from friction.|$|R
40|$|This paper puts forth a {{theoretical}} analysis grounded in ethnographic methods {{to explore the}} form, function, and meaning of hashi- ire as an occupation {{within the context of}} Japanese psychiatry. In keeping with occupational science and therapy, the term occupation is used here to denote a broad domain of purposeful and/or meaningful daily activity such as work and leisure. The term hashi- ire refers to the assembly of disposable <b>wooden</b> chopstick <b>packages,</b> a program that was widely used under the auspices of Japanese psychiatric rehabilitation immediately following the Second World War, but has become a rare occurrence today. From a rehabilitative and medical framework hashi- ire has been viewed with some skepticism as a way to pass time and under some circumstances as a potential venue for skill building. The uncommonness of this occupation in psychiatric settings today makes it a unique and interesting event for social analysis. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to go beyond the context of the traditional medical framework and provide a description of one environment in which hashi-ire was observed. Within this paper, hashi- ire will serve as a mechanism to further understand the concept of occupation within the context of a mental health program. The ethnographic data used in this paper are based on interviews and participant observation. Preliminary analyses reveal that hashi- ire provides an opportunity for participants to meet peers, it provides structure for a daily routine, and it provides an avenue towards health and relaxation. Furthermore hashi- ire may be a potential source of community building, a mechanism for apprenticed learning, and a venue through which an individual shapes his/her identity...|$|R
40|$|The Two cultivars of kiwi fruit, Hayward and Abbot, {{with the}} {{desirable}} quality were harvested on time from Valiabad, a region in Tonekabon (Mazanddaran Provicnce). Fruits were graded and packed in the wooden boxes, cartons and {{low density polyethylene}} (LDPE) films, the fruits were cold stored in a proper and constant conditions (T= ± 0. 5 & RH= 90 - 95 %) {{for a period of}} 6 months. Samples were taken in completely randomised design from each package for intervals of 30 ± 3 days and during storage (6 months). Chemical characteristics such as the total soluble solids(TSS), titratable acidity as citric acid, dry matter, vitamin C and the Physical characteristics such as yield point (Y. P.), yield point strength (Y. P. S.), penetration force (P. F.) and penetration stress (P. S.) were measured. Statistical analysis was performed with the factorial experiment in an unequal completely randomized design and the means compaired by Duncan multiple range test. The results indicated that, cv, Abbot has shorter shelf life, 4 months, compared to Hayward with 6 months storage period. Hayward contained more dry matter than Abbot throughout the storage period. Total soluble solids of cultivars increased and titrable acidity as citric acid decreased during storage. Vitamin C of Abbot was more than Hayward throughout the storage. Total factors in relation to texture and physical properties decreased by time such texture Hayward cv. after six month storage and in Abbot after four month storage was softer.

40|$|Wood {{used to be}} {{the most}} common {{material}} for packaging, workbenches, shelves, tools, buildings, interiors etc., in the food industry in the Nordic countries. The use of wood has however decreased, and other materials like plastic, concrete, stainless steel and aluminium have taken its place. The reason for this negative development seems to be declining market demands, partly caused by legislation in Europe and elsewhere. Despite this, nearly 1, 5 million cubic meter of timber per year is used for pallets and packaging in the Nordic countries. These products are hence of great importance for the wood industry as the alternative production of packaging materials may be chips for pulp production. Based on that background, a Nordic research project was initiated {{to find out more about}} the behaviour of wood in contact with foodstuff.

40|$|Since {{its first}} {{applications}} in the late 1970, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology has increasingly spread as an effective environmental management tool and has nowadays become a well-established analytical method to quantify {{the environmental impacts of}} products and processes at industrial level. Despite its popularity and codification by organizations such as the International Organization for Standardization, the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry and harmonization initiatives promoted at European level (i. e. by the European Platform on LCA) through the publication of the ILCD Handbook, LCA methodology is still under development {{and there are a lot}} of open research issues which are widely discussed in literature. Considering the increasing number of applications at industrial level, LCA is recognized not only as a field of scientific research but also a business of growing importance, whose successful development requires both influx of new ideas and harmonized methodologies and reliable and credible applications. The primary needs of industries on LCA rely on the definition of tools for increasing the reliability of LCA results and solutions for enhancing the applicability of the methodology. The present research mainly focuses on how to translate into practice these two aspects, with the aim of providing practical solutions for improving the reliability of the methodology and facilitate its application at industrial level. The methodology applied is based on the conduction of multiple case studies, analyzing different sectors, both at product (tissue paper, milk <b>packaging,</b> <b>wooden</b> pallet) and process level (agricultural processes, wastewater treatment). Furthermore, the main applications of LCA methodology within the private sector are considered: comparison between different solutions, improvement of environmental performances and design of new products. The aspect of how to increase the reliability of LCA results is addressed in the first part of the work, including the first three chapters. The starting point is that both the credibility and transparency of an LCA study can be enhanced by giving more attention to quantifying uncertainties. Uncertainties considered in the present work are connected with parameter uncertainty (connected with data variability) and scenario uncertainty (connected with subjective choices). Therefore the role of the two techniques identified by the ISO 14040 standards to analyze uncertainties during the interpretation phase of LCA, i. e. uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analysis, is discussed. The second part of the work deals with the definition of simplified tools tailored to users’ requirements in order to increase the applicability of the LCA methodology. Streamlined tools are mainly connected with the definition of approaches to simplify the Life Cycle Inventory phase, which is the most time and resource demanding phase of an LCA study. Especially for small- and medium-size enterprises that rarely have the knowledge and resources necessary to implement LCA, a priority is indeed to facilitate the access to reliable, accurate, and relevant life cycle information, reducing efforts connected with data acquisition. ...|$|R
