5000|$|Two years later, in May 1924, the Fascist leader Benito Mussolini, then prime minister, visited Sicily {{and also}} passed through Piana degli Albanesi {{where he was}} {{received}} by the mayor Don Ciccio.

[...] Mussolini felt humiliated and outraged. To Cuccia the large police escort indicated a lack of respect. When Mussolini declined to release the substantial police force, Cuccia had the central town square emptied when Il Duce made his speech. Mussolini found himself addressing a group of some 20 village idiots, beggars, bootblacks and lottery ticket sellers picked out as an audience by Don Ciccio.|$|E
