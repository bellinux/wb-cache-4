Once in the city, San Martín enrolled in Málaga's school of temporalities, beginning his studies in 1785. It is unlikely that he finished the six-year-long elementary education, before he enrolled in the Regiment of Murcia in 1789, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> required age of 11.

The new organisation went into effect in September 1944, with Lieutenant General Walter Krueger's Sixth US Army, Lieutenant General Robert Eichelberger's Eighth United States Army, Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee's First Australian Army, Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead's I Australian Corps and Major General Oscar Griswold's XIV Corps reporting directly to GHQ. Allied Land Forces remained as an important administrative and logistical command, until it was abolished, along with SWPA, on 2 September 1945.|$|E

5|$|As many as 13 now-extinct {{species of}} macaw have {{variously}} been suggested {{to have lived}} on the Caribbean islands, {{but many of these}} were based on old descriptions or drawings and only represent hypothetical species. In addition to the Lesser Antillean macaw, only two endemic Caribbean macaw species are known from physical remains; the Cuban macaw is known from 19 museum skins and subfossils, and the Saint Croix macaw (A. autochthones) is known only from subfossils. Macaws are known to have been transported between the Caribbean islands and from mainland South America to the Caribbean both in historic times by Europeans and native peoples, and in prehistoric times by Paleoamericans. Parrots were important in the culture of native Caribbeans, and were among the gifts offered to Christopher Columbus <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> Bahamas in 1492. Historical records of macaws on these islands, therefore, may not have represented distinct, endemic species; {{it is also possible that}} these macaws were escaped or feral birds that had been transported to the islands from elsewhere. All the endemic Caribbean macaws were likely driven to extinction by humans in historic and prehistoric times. The identity and distribution of indigenous macaws in the Caribbean is only likely to be further resolved through paleontological discoveries and examination of contemporary reports and artwork.|$|E
5|$|Bert Combs {{was born}} in the Town Branch section of Manchester, Kentucky on August 13, 1911; he was one of seven {{children}} of Stephen Gibson and Martha (Jones) Combs. Combs's father Stephen, a part-time logger and farmer, was active in local politics, despite being a Democrat in a county where a large majority of residents were Republicans. His mother was a teacher, and she impressed upon her children the importance of a good education. Bert's first school was the two-room Beech Creek grade school. <b>When</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> seventh grade, his parents sent him and his sister to Oneida Baptist Institute in nearby Oneida because its school term was 8 to 9 months long, as opposed to the 5- to 6-month terms at Beech Creek. Later, Combs and his sister began riding a donkey every day to Clay County High School. Combs excelled academically and skipped some grades, graduating as valedictorian of his class in 1927 at age 15.|$|E
5|$|Macaws {{are known}} to have been transported between the Caribbean islands and from {{mainland}} South America both in historic times by Europeans and natives, and prehistoric times by Paleoamericans. Parrots were important in the culture of native Caribbeans, were traded between islands, and were among the gifts offered to Christopher Columbus <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> Bahamas in 1492. It is therefore difficult to determine whether the numerous historical records of macaws on these islands refer to distinct, endemic species, since they could have been based on escaped individuals or feral populations of foreign macaws of known species that had been transported there. As many as thirteen extinct macaws have been suggested to have lived on the islands until recently. Only three endemic Caribbean macaw species are known from physical remains; the Cuban macaw (Ara tricolor) is known from nineteen museum skins and subfossils, the Saint Croix macaw (Ara autochthones) is only known from subfossils, and the Lesser Antillean macaw is known from subfossils and reports. No endemic Caribbean macaws remain today; they were likely driven to extinction by humans in historic and prehistoric times.|$|E

Pearson quit the team after the race. Pearson had won 43 races between 1972 and 79 while driving for the Wood Brothers. Later during the season, Rod Osterlund's rookie driver, Dale Earnhardt, suffered a shoulder injury. Osterlund hired Pearson to replace Earnhardt during four races; he collected the pole position at Michigan and won the 1979 Southern 500. For the season, Pearson had competed in nine races and finished 32nd in points. Fans voted him as NASCAR's Most Popular Driver.|$|E
5|$|The {{first century}} in the {{championship}} was scored by Dennis Amiss of England when he made 137 against India in the 1975 World Cup. The same day New Zealand's Glenn Turner scored 171 not out against East Africa. It remained the highest individual total {{over the next two}} editions until Indian cricketer Kapil Dev scored 175 not out against Zimbabwe in 1983. Following that, the record was broken successively by Viv Richards (181) in 1987, Gary Kirsten (188 not out) in 1996, Chris Gayle (215) and Martin Guptill (237 not out) both in 2015. India cricketer Sachin Tendulkar holds the record for the highest number of centuries with six, followed by Australia's Ricky Ponting and Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara with five each. Mark Waugh, Sourav Ganguly, Mahela Jayawardene, AB de Villiers and Tillakaratne Dilshan are joint-third with four centuries. Three players have scored three centuries in a single tournament– Waugh, Ganguly, and Matthew Hayden– in 1996, 2003, 2007 respectively, while Sangakkara made four consecutive centuries in the 2015 World Cup. Ireland's Kevin O'Brien recorded the fastest century <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> figure in 50 balls, against England in the 2011 World Cup. In 1992, Andy Flower of Zimbabwe– making his ODI debut in a World Cup– scored a century.

5|$|Thorpe {{arrived in}} Fukuoka having been chosen by {{broadcaster}} TV Asahi as the marketing drawcard of the event. With the 4×100m freestyle relay being held after the 400m freestyle {{on the first}} night, Thorpe appeared to be conserving energy <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> 200m mark two seconds outside his world record. Although he was 0.93s behind at the final turn, a final 50m burst in 24.36s saw him cut a further 0.42s from his world record. The relay saw him dive in fractionally ahead of American Jason Lezak after Klim, Callus and Pearson had completed the first three legs. Thorpe fell behind in the early half of the leg before kicking away in the closing stages, to seal gold with his fastest-ever relay split of 47.87s. In the 800m final, he shadowed Hackett for the first 750m, staying within a body length. He then broke clear to win by a body length, lowering his world record by over two seconds. The 200m freestyle rematch with van den Hoogenband provided Thorpe {{with a chance to}} rectify his strategy from the Olympics; this time he allowed the Dutchman to lead through the first 100m. Thorpe pulled even at the 150m mark and then broke away towards the finishing wall two body lengths clear. He lowered his world record to 1min 44.06s in the process, prompting van den Hoogenband to raise his arm aloft. Thorpe's winning streak was interrupted in the 100m freestyle when his personal best of 48.81s placed him fourth, but he returned to form in the 4×200m freestyle relay. Anchoring the team of Klim, Hackett and Kirby, the Australians lowered their world record time by more than two seconds, leaving the Italians more than six seconds in arrears. Having overtaken Klim as Australia's leading 100m freestyle swimmer, Thorpe was entrusted with anchoring the 4×100m medley relay team on 28 July. After Matt Welsh, Regan Harrison and Geoff Huegill had finished their legs, Thorpe's change left him half a body length behind the new 100m world champion Anthony Ervin of the United States. The Americans were expected to win, and with his typically slow start, Thorpe turned a body length behind with 50m remaining. With an American victory seeming inevitable, Thorpe managed to accelerate and deprive Ervin of the lead in the last 5m. This made Thorpe the only swimmer to have won six gold medals at a World Championships, and the first since Shaw in 1974 to win the 200–400–800 treble. His performances formed the basis for Australia's gold medal win over the United States 13–9. It was also {{the first time since the}} 1956 Summer Olympics that Australia had topped the medal tally at a global meet. Thorpe's achievements led to predictions that he could match Mark Spitz's seven gold medals at the 1972 Summer Olympics, which he played down.|$|E
