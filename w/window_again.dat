5|$|In Bethany, Vermont, a raven frightens {{a little}} girl, Michelle Crittendon, at a park while a neighbor, Jenny Uphouse, watches. The bird is later found at her home. Her mother, Martha Crittendon, is then {{attacked}} {{and killed by}} an unseen monster. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) are on a stakeout looking {{for a woman who}} is possibly killing prostitutes. Mulder believes she has the power to disappear because every time police attempt to arrest her she cannot be found. While on lookout, Mulder gets a call about the attack and leaves. Back at the office, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) tells Mulder that Crittendon disappeared and asks him what he knows about ravens. Mulder believes that the bird is usually associated with evil. Skinner tells Mulder that this case is a top priority because Crittendon is the wife of a powerful judge. At the Crittendon home, Martha's husband, Howard, tells Mulder that his wife was cheating on him because he found birth control pills, which is suspicious because Howard has had a vasectomy. Another neighbor, Ellen Adderly, the wife of Sheriff Phil Adderly, is approached by Jenny and then sees a raven before the window of a nearby car shatters. At the Crittendon home, Michelle sees the raven outside her <b>window</b> <b>again</b> and Howard leaves to check it out, leading him to find a hand sticking out above the flower bushes. Later the police dig up Martha's body, with claw marks all over her face.|$|E
25|$|The west facade has a {{basement}} entrance and tripartite <b>window,</b> <b>again</b> with diamond-paned colored glass, on the apse flanked by pointed {{windows on the}} pent-roofed sides, with another octagonal oculus in the rear gable field above where the apse projects. Below the apse the basement is mortared fieldstone. Windows, a main entrance and a secondary entrance {{on the south side}} are trabeated with brick.|$|E
25|$|The {{caretaker}} at the Otis home {{heard of}} the Zeehandelaar bomb, and decided to search around the Otis house. He found a leather suitcase behind some bushes under a bay <b>window.</b> <b>Again</b> the police arrived, and carried the suitcase {{away from the house}} and out in the open. But while they were cutting open the suitcase, the clockwork alarm went off inside the suitcase. The police ran to safety just before the bomb exploded. Investigators speculated that, like the Zeehandelaar bomb, the clock mechanism at the Otis house had been wound too tightly, delaying the explosion.|$|E
60|$|In {{the third}} four-wheeled cab, where the <b>windows</b> <b>again</b> were wide open, Martin Stone, {{with his hands}} thrust deep {{into the pockets of}} his coat, and his long legs crossed, sat staring at the roof, with a sort of twisted scorn on his pale face.|$|R
50|$|The building's {{office space}} is divided {{according}} to the axis of the outside <b>windows,</b> <b>again</b> making use of natural light as much as possible. The interior walls are non-load-bearing, and can therefore be re-arranged according to need, a feature that has become standard in modern office buildings.|$|R
5000|$|The {{north side}} has three small round-arched <b>windows,</b> <b>again</b> with stained glass. The west gable {{has a single}} pointed-arch window with stained glass, while the east gable has a single, large round-arch window with stained glass with a cross finial on {{the apex of the}} roof above.|$|R
500|$|On {{each side}} {{elevation}} there are central canted bay windows. [...] The middle floor has arched {{windows on the}} west front, while the corresponding windows on the east front are blind. [...] On {{each side of the}} house are two-storey pavilion wings joined to the main block by quadrant (curved), single-storey corridors. [...] Each pavilion is symmetrical and identical, built in brick with stone dressings. [...] Each is in three bays, the central bay forming a canted bay <b>window.</b> <b>Again,</b> the windows are sashes.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Vivian colored {{more deeply}} {{and glanced at}} the <b>window</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr Prosser half turned, then {{thrust his}} {{head through the}} <b>window</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|With the {{greatest}} delicacy {{he shifted his}} ground to the <b>windows</b> <b>again,</b> {{and asked if he}} could look at one of them. On Nevilleâ€™s opening it, he immediately sprang out, as if he were going aloft with a whole watch in an emergency, and were setting a bright example.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: 4-component net {{radiometer}} {{showing the}} instrument's main components: 2 pyranometers (with domes, one visible at right facing {{up and the}} second at right facing down obscured by the white radiation shield above it) and 2 pyrgeometers (flat <b>windows,</b> <b>again</b> one visible (facing up) and one obscured (facing down)). Dimensions: diameter of the pyranometer dome is 20 mm. Photo shows model NR01.|$|R
2500|$|A new glazing {{pattern was}} introduced. The door and two glazed {{sides of the}} K2 each had 18 equal-sized panes of glass {{arranged}} in 6 rows of 3. In the K6 the number of rows was increased to 8, and the central column of panes was made considerably wider than those to either side. This improved visibility, and gave a more horizontal appearance to the <b>windows,</b> <b>again</b> in keeping with [...] "moderne" [...] principles.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Collins {{looked up}} and grunted and looked out of the <b>window</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|But Will at last {{turned away}} from his {{portfolio}} and approached the <b>window</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr. Worthington {{walked to}} the <b>window</b> <b>again,</b> perhaps to compose himself, and then came back again.|$|E
50|$|For {{this purpose}} the Club engaged {{architect}} number three, (or was it four?), {{by the name}} of Benjamin Conner, who extended the front wall of the original building directly upwards to create a new larger billiard hall and long gallery - now used as a gym - lit by a regular rhythm of single <b>windows.</b> <b>Again</b> exposed timber roof trusses and partial roof glazing are used to good effect in these spaces.|$|R
50|$|Both {{of those}} facades have an {{identical}} treatment, echoing the Chase Building and City Hall. Like them, {{the first story}} is finished in rusticated segmented arches. They are set with six-section rounded-arch <b>windows,</b> <b>again</b> creating an arcade effect. The windows' sections are a full window with flanking sidelights and three matching sections in the fan. Beneath them are wooden panels decorated with the same wave pattern used in City Hall's parapet panels.|$|R
5000|$|A new glazing {{pattern was}} introduced. The door and two glazed {{sides of the}} K2 each had 18 equal-sized panes of glass {{arranged}} in 6 rows of 3. In the K6 the number of rows was increased to 8, and the central column of panes was made considerably wider than those to either side. This improved visibility, and gave a more horizontal appearance to the <b>windows,</b> <b>again</b> in keeping with [...] "moderne" [...] principles.|$|R
60|$|He {{could never}} get in at that <b>window</b> <b>again,</b> Christian said; it was far too high up.|$|E
60|$|She bit {{her lips}} to keep from crying out. She looked out of the <b>window</b> <b>again,</b> seeking control.|$|E
60|$|Tom {{ran up to}} the <b>window</b> <b>again.</b> It {{was true}} Baxter and the man with a scar had disappeared.|$|E
40|$|For {{ten days}} or so there had been Carnival parades along St. Charles Avenue almost every weekday evening and on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, and we {{were still in the}} pre-Mardi Gras weekend, to be {{followed}} by Lundi Gras, with its two elaborate parades, and then Carnival Day itself, given over entirely to revelry, from the marching clubs waking us up at dawn, through Zulu, Rex, and the truck parades. Sounds of the street activity, both organized and spontaneous, had risen to my <b>windows</b> <b>again</b> [...] ...|$|R
50|$|At the 1958 Turin Motor Show Vignale {{introduced}} another special Appia variant, the Lancia Appia Lusso or Berlina Lusso. It was 2-door saloon with frameless {{doors and}} ample <b>windows,</b> <b>again</b> with styling by Michelotti {{derived from the}} 1956 Lancia Gran Lusso. All Vignale Lusso were built on a specific Tipo 812.02 chassis, a strengthened series three platform. Front wings and bonnet were shared with the Convertibile, but the Lusso was longer, larger and taller. In total 477 Appia Lusso {{were made in the}} Vignale factory from 1959 to 1962.|$|R
60|$|At {{that moment}} the notion of seeking Captain Mitchell passed through his mind. He glanced in the {{direction}} of the jetty and saw a small gleam of light in the O.S.N. Company's building. The thought of lighted windows was not attractive. Two lighted windows had decoyed him into the empty Custom House, only to fall into the clutches of that doctor. No! He would not go near lighted <b>windows</b> <b>again</b> on that night. Captain Mitchell was there. And what could he be told? That doctor would worm it all out of him as if he were a child.|$|R
60|$|He {{paused and}} leaned {{out of the}} <b>window</b> <b>again,</b> whilst she watched him, breathless and terrified. She was {{beginning}} to understand.|$|E
60|$|The gentleman got up {{and walked}} to the <b>window</b> <b>again</b> and back: seriously uneasy, though giving his uneasiness this {{peculiar}} expression.|$|E
60|$|He sighed faintly, and {{glancing at}} the girl, who was looking out of the <b>window</b> <b>again,</b> took up his pen and signed his blotting-paper.|$|E
6000|$|... "Better {{have your}} {{place by the}} <b>window</b> back <b>again,</b> Miss Thurnbrein," [...] the girl at her side said suddenly. [...] "You're looking like Clara, just before she popped off. My, ain't it awful!" ...|$|R
2500|$|The office/living {{quarters}} measures 16'4" [...] by 32'10", {{the western}} side being the front. The building is split almost equally into two rooms, with a fireplace in the internal wall between them. The slightly larger room has two doors, {{in the east and}} west walls directly opposite one another. Both east and west walls also have 1/1 double sash <b>windows,</b> <b>again</b> directly opposite each other. The smaller room has a single door, on {{the western side}}, with two /1 double sash windows, on the south and east walls. The roof is of simple gable construction, originally covered with wood shingles, but is now covered with green asphalt shingles.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} was {{a department store}} with a modern style in an urban context. It was constructed of brick and concrete. The shopping area within the building had mainly wooden furnishings and, {{in the absence of}} air conditioning, had a large number of <b>windows.</b> <b>Again</b> owing to the absence of air conditioning, the food hall was situated in the basement. The name of the store was displayed in lettering some 7.5' in height and illuminated after dark. The booklet which he designed for the opening features Mendelsohn's coloured sketch. He also created a logo and branding style based on the lettering on the faÃ§ade of the store.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mrs. Burrows was cremated on Wednesday. It seems she {{preferred}} it to burial." [...] Having said this, {{he turned to}} stare from the <b>window</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You'll {{get nothing}} more to eat till night," [...] she said, looking out of the <b>window</b> <b>again.</b> [...] "Take your hound-dog's face out of the room." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{stared at}} him, {{breathing}} heavily, then {{looked out of}} the <b>window</b> <b>again.</b> At last she turned to him. She seemed to refer to his invitation.|$|E
50|$|On {{the second}} series of five batches, the boiler {{overpressure}} {{was raised to}} 10 bar. The first two batches (delivered 1867 - 1869), unusually, were peat-fired and hauled a covered peat tender. The first batch had side windows on the driver's cab and cylindrical or funnel-shaped chimneys. The second batch (see illustration of ORLANDO DI LASSO) lost the side <b>windows</b> <b>again.</b> Batches three and four, delivered in 1870, were a mix of peat-fired engines with funnel smokestacks and coal-fired engines with conical chimneys. The final batch of 6 engines, delivered in 1871, were peat-fired with funnel smokestacks and no side windows and rounded corners to the cabs.|$|R
6000|$|I {{turned to}} the <b>window</b> and <b>again</b> {{looked up into the}} sky. There was a great star up there, and it seemed to wink cheerfully at me as the words came into my mind, [...] "her husband's successor." ...|$|R
60|$|Duncombe {{was silent}} for a moment. He walked restlessly to the <b>window</b> and back <b>again.</b>|$|R
