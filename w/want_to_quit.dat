[...] He emphasized that, if he were ever forced to choose between professional football or studying for the ministry, he would give up football: [...] "I see no reason why I can't do both, but if I have to give up pro ball, I'll certainly do it." [...] Timberlake said the thing he would always remember about playing football was the 20 minutes before kickoff. [...] He recalled that those 20 minutes were [...] "horrible." [...] "You want to go home. [...] You <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> football. [...] It is times like these when something happens to me. [...] I can't explain it.

40|$|Objective: Enhancing {{adolescent}} cessation {{requires an}} understanding of approaches that will motivate youths <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking. Methods: We compared reasons for <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> expressed by European Americans to those of African American youths. Adolescent cessation-seeking smokers completed telephone interviews regarding their smoking behavior and reasons for <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> in an open-ended format. Responses were then classified into nine categories. Results: Participants included 1, 268 Baltimore- area adolescents (mean age 15. 6 6 1. 7 years, 60 % female, 58 % European American, mean Fagerstro¨m Test for Nicotine Dependence 5. 8 6 2. 2). While both groups broadly cited health as the predominant reason for <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit,</b> chi-square analyses of further stratification of health into general, future, and current health concerns showed that European Americans {{were more likely to}} endorse current health reasons (P,. 001), while African Americans were more likely to state general health reasons (P 5. 004). European Americans were more likely to state cost (P 5. 002) or to not give a reason for <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> (P 5. 008), while African Americans more frequently reported a lack of positive (pharmacologic or social) reinforcement (P,. 001). Conclusions: The development of culturally tailored messages may help enhance smoking cessation efforts among adolescents...|$|R

500|$|The {{following}} day, Hendrix {{received a}} phone call from one of his girlfriends, Devon Wilson, who had become jealous after hearing rumors that he was dating another woman, Kirsten Nefer. Nefer recalled: [...] "I heard Jimi talk to Devon... she was mad... she went into fits... Jimi said 'Devon, get off my back'". Hendrix was scheduled to perform in Rotterdam on September 13, but the show, along with three others, was cancelled due to Cox's incapacitation. During the evening of September 13, Nefer visited Hendrix at the Cumberland. After informing him that she would have to go back to work that evening, he convinced her to phone her boss, actor George Lazenby, and ask for the night off. Lazenby became angry and shouted over the phone to Nefer: [...] "You're nothing but a fucking groupie", which Hendrix overheard. The exchange upset him, and he told Nefer: [...] "Don't you ever go out to that guy again". Nefer explained to him that she had spent six months working on a film with Lazenby and that she did not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> her job; Hendrix eventually agreed. Nefer spent the night with him and left in the morning.|$|E

[...] Sepulvado's {{positive}} impact on Jones' life and career cannot be overstated; she eventually cleaned up his finances, kept him away from his drug dealers (who reportedly kidnapped her daughter in retaliation), and managed his career. [...] Jones always gave her complete credit for saving his life. [...] Nancy, who did not drink, explained to Nick Tosches in 1994, [...] "He was drinking but he was fun to be around. [...] It wasn't {{love at first sight}} or anything like that. [...] But I saw what a good person he was, deep down, and I couldn't help caring about him."

[...] But by that time, physically and emotionally exhausted, he really did <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> drinking. [...] In March 1984 in Birmingham, Alabama - at the age of 52 - Jones performed his first sober show since the early seventies. [...] "All my life it seems like I've been running from something," [...] he told the United Press International in June. [...] "If I knew what it was, maybe I could run in the right direction.

[...] Jones began making up many of the dates he had missed, playing them for free to pay back promoters, and began opening his concerts with [...] "No Show Jones", a song he had written with Glen Martin that poked fun at himself and other country singers. [...] Jones always stressed that he was not proud of the way he treated loved ones and friends over the years and was ashamed of disappointing his fans when he missed shows, telling Billboard in 2006 that [...] "I know it hurt my fans in a way and I've always been sad about that, it really bothered me for a long time." ...|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} {{recall of}} anti-tobacco advertising (mainstream and targeted), pack warning labels, and news stories among a national sample of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smokers, {{and to assess}} the association of these messages with attitudes that support <b>quitting,</b> including <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> Design, setting and participants: A quota sampling design was used to recruit participants from communities served by 34 Aboriginal community-controlled health services and one community in the Torres Strait. We surveyed 1643 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smokers from April 2012 to October 2013. Main outcome measures: Frequency of recall of advertising and information, warning labels and news stories; recall of targeted and local advertising; attitudes about smoking and <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit.</b> Results: More smokers recalled often noticing warning labels {{in the past month}} (65 %) than recalled advertising and information (45 %) or news stories (24 %) in the past 6 months. When prompted, most (82 %) recalled seeing a television advertisement. Just under half (48 %) recalled advertising that featured an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person or artwork (targeted advertising), and 16 % recalled targeted advertising from their community (local advertising). Frequent recall of warning labels, news stories and advertising was associated with worry about health and <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit,</b> but only frequent advertising recall was associated with believing that society disapproves of smoking. The magnitude of association with relevant attitudes and <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> increased for targeted and local advertising. Conclusions: Strategies to tackle Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smoking should sustain high levels of exposure to anti-tobacco advertising, news stories and warning labels. More targeted and local information may be particularly effective to influence relevant beliefs and subsequently increase quitting...|$|R

40|$|Background: Nearly 275 million adults use tobacco in India, which {{contributes}} substantially {{to potentially}} preventable morbidity and mortality. Awareness towards tobacco is increasing steadily but its role towards cessation is questionable. There {{is little evidence}} available about quitting behavior in the Uttarakhand region. Aims & Objectives : <b>To</b> assess the <b>quitting</b> behavior among current tobacco users in a rural population of Dehradun. Material and Methods : The study was cross sectional in nature carried out among 993 current tobacco users aged 10 years and above in the field practice area and quitting behavior was assessed using a pretested and predesigned questionnaire. Result : Of the 993 Current tobacco users, 38 % and 40 % of the current smokers and current smokeless tobacco users respectively had attempted <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking and smokeless tobacco use in the past 12 months. 54. 3 % of the smokers <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking with majority of male smokers (56. 3 %) willing <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking compared <b>to</b> only 40. 5 % of female smokers. 36. 0 % of the smokeless tobacco users <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smokeless tobacco use where in contrast more female smokeless tobacco users (39. 3 %) <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smokeless tobacco compared to 33. 3 % of males. Conclusion: Previous quit attempts {{were found to be}} more among males compared to females. The desire <b>to</b> <b>quit</b> smoking tobacco was also found to be more among males as compared to female smokers.
