5|$|During the 2011 Canadian federal election, Harper {{promised to}} {{establish}} the NAP-CHT by 2012 and to invest $20 million into it. The annual budget of British Columbia's Office to Combat Trafficking in Persons (OCTIP) was reduced by $200,000 a few months later. OCTIP was Canada's only provincial government agency responsible for coordinating efforts to address human trafficking. The federal government held a round table to determine {{the contents of the}} NAP-CHT. Carleen McGuinty, child protection specialist for the Christian NGO World Vision Canada, said at the discussion that the NAP-CHT should focus on the needs of children and that the plan should not emphasize child sexual abuse to the exclusion of addressing child labour. Smith said that she was confident that Harper <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>her</b> review the plan before it was established. The government consulted ACT Alberta, The Salvation Army, and the AAMS {{in the development of the}} plan.|$|E
5|$|Pompeo {{signed a}} new {{contract}} for Grey's Anatomy in 2011 that increased her salary to US$200,000 per episode, and renewed the contract for two more seasons in 2012. She was named the eighth highest paid TV actress in 2012, earning $9 million. She extended her contract for two more years, which <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>her</b> involved with the show until its 12th season. As of 2013, she earns $350,000 per episode plus millions from syndication. She was ranked fourth {{in the list of}} highest paid television actresses again in 2015, in the Forbes list, with the earnings of $11.5 million. Pompeo's contract with the company expired again {{at the end of the}} twelfth season along with the other original cast members, and she signed a new one with increased pay cheque. She held on the fourth spot in Forbes list in 2016, bringing in $14 million, a 32% increase in the earnings from 2015.|$|E
5|$|The first {{main event}} match was the TNA Knockouts Makeover Battle Royal, {{the winner of}} which would become the number one {{contender}} to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship. It involved Angelina Love, Christy Hemme, Gail Kim, Jackie Moore, ODB, Salinas, Rhaka Khan, Roxxi Laveaux, Traci Brooks, and Velvet Sky. This contest involved two stages; {{the first was a}} standard battle royal. After all but two wrestlers were eliminated, stage two, a ladder match, began. The winner of the ladder match would become the number one contender to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship; the loser <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>her</b> head shaved. The final four were Kim, Laveaux, Love, and ODB. The next eliminated was ODB, followed by Love; both were eliminated by Laveaux. Only Kim and Laveaux remained for the ladder match portion. Kim had won immunity on the May8 episode of Impact!, so if Laveaux won the match, then Love's head would be shaven. Love and Sky interfered in the contest several times. During the bout, as Kim and Laveaux stood on the ladder, Kim flipped over Laveaux, grabbed her around the legs, and slammed her into the mat back-first with a powerbomb. Laveaux's head was legitimately cut open during this stage. Later, while Laxeaux climbed the ladder in an attempt to retrieve the contract, Love interfered by pushing the ladder over. Kim followed by climbing the ladder and grabbing the contract to win the encounter at ten minutes. Afterwards, Laveaux was forced to have her head shaven.|$|E

25|$|The ninth {{match was}} between Victoria and Molly Holly for the WWE Women's Championship, where Holly <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>her</b> hair shaved if she lost. Victoria would counter a Widow's peak attempt by Holly into a Backslide pin {{to win the}} match and retain the WWE Women's Championship. Holly tried running towards the {{backstage}} area to escape the match's stipulation, but was eventually stopped by Victoria, who would knock her out and shave her bald.|$|E
25|$|In her {{contributions}} to Ken Burns's award-winning documentary television series Baseball (1994), Goodwin related stories {{about growing up}} as a Brooklyn Dodgers fan. She noted that her father <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>her</b> document the baseball game from the radio and replay {{the events of the}} game once he returned home. She cited this as her first experience as a historian. She chronicles her family's love for the Dodgers until the team's move to Los Angeles in 1957. When she met her husband in the late 1960s, she became a Boston Red Sox fan, even though her father became a New York Mets fan; one of her sisters later became a Colorado Rockies fan, and her other sister stayed a Dodgers fan.|$|E
60|$|I {{have since}} {{wondered}} if the Spanish girl <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been happy had Fate consented to her choice.

In a responsive atmosphere <b>her</b> proud ambition <b>would</b> <b>have</b> fulfilled <b>her</b> will. With the cold and critical she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> lost <b>her</b> subtile charm. Away from her mountains and unconventional life she might have learned sad lessons.

25|$|Stieglitz's mother Hedwig died in November 1922, {{and as he}} {{did with}} his father he buried his grief in his work. He spent time with Paul Strand and his new wife Rebecca (Beck), {{reviewed}} the work of another newcomer named Edward Weston and began organizing a new show of O'Keeffe's work. Her show opened in early 1923, and Stieglitz spent much of the spring marketing her work. Eventually twenty of her paintings sold for more than $3,000. In the summer, O'Keeffe once again took off for the seclusion of the Southwest, and for a while Stieglitz was alone with Beck Strand at Lake George. He took a series of nude photos of her, and soon he became infatuated with her. They had a brief physical affair before O'Keeffe returned in the fall. O'Keeffe could tell what had happened, but since she did not see Stieglitz's new lover as a serious threat to their relationship she let things pass. Six years later she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>her</b> own affair with Beck Strand in New Mexico.|$|E
500|$|In 1915 and 1916, Michelena {{wrote the}} regular {{newspaper}} column [...] "Talks with Screen-struck Girls", carried at {{first by the}} San Rafael Independent on Tuesdays but then appeared on Sundays in other newspapers: San Francisco Examiner and the Prescott Journal-Miner (Arizona). She wrote about the ideal qualities found in an actress, and what girls might do to develop them. She received a torrent of letters from readers—many were from girls asking [...] "Must I be able to ride" [...] and [...] "Must I be able to swim". In response, Michelena described in the column how those skills were helpful to a movie actress, but not absolutely necessary; she said they [...] "are accessories to, rather than {{the substance of the}} thing... I would advise every girl entering motion pictures to learn to ride and swim and do all the rest of it, but I <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>her</b> realize their subordination to the really artistic side of the profession." ...|$|E

For the next ten years, she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>her</b> greatest success. Gayle was awarded [...] "Female Vocalist of the Year" [...] for two years by the Country Music Association Awards (1977 and 1978) and for three years by the Academy of Country Music (1976–1977 and 1979).|$|E
2500|$|Her first {{contract}} {{allowed her}} to record compositions only by Four Star writers, which Cline found limiting. Later, she expressed regret over signing with the label, but thinking that nobody else <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>her,</b> she took the deal. Her first record for Four Star was [...] "A Church, A Courtroom & Then Good-Bye," [...] which attracted little attention, although it led to appearances on the Grand Ole Opry. As these performances were not [...] "records" [...] per se, they were not governed by her contract, and she could sing what she wanted, within reason. This somewhat eased her [...] "stifled" [...] feeling.|$|E

Dinah's Place, primarily sponsored by Colgate-Palmolive (which later sponsored her women's golf tournament), was a 30-minute Monday-through-Friday program broadcast at 10:00am (ET) over NBC, her network home since 1939. Shore described this show as a [...] "Do-Show" [...] {{as opposed to a}} chat show because she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>her</b> guests demonstrate an unexpected skill, for example, Frank Sinatra sharing his spaghetti sauce recipe, Spiro Agnew playing keyboard accompanying Dinah on [...] "Sophisticated Lady", or Ginger Rogers showing Shore how to throw a clay pot on a potter's wheel.|$|E

She said she did not know why the dead man <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>her</b> phone number and chose to visit her suburb on the night of his death. However, she also {{reported}} that, at some time in late 1948, an unidentified man had attempted to visit her and asked a next door neighbour about her. In his book on the case, Gerry Feltus stated that when he interviewed Thomson (2002), he found that she was either being [...] "evasive" [...] or she [...] "just did not wish to talk about it". Feltus believed Thomson knew the Somerton man's identity. [...] Thomson's daughter Kate, in a television interview (2014) with 60 Minutes, also said that she believed her mother knew the dead man.|$|E
2500|$|It {{is thought}} that the couple are already married because of the woman's headdress. A non-married woman <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>her</b> hair down, {{according}} to Margaret Carroll. The placement of the two figures suggests conventional 15th century views of marriage and gender roles – the woman stands near the bed and well into the room, symbolic of her role as the caretaker of the house, whereas Giovanni stands near the open window, symbolic of {{his role in the}} outside world. [...] Arnolfini looks directly out at the viewer, his wife gazes obediently at her husband. His hand is vertically raised, representing his commanding position of authority, whilst she has her hand in a lower, horizontal, more submissive pose. However, her gaze at her husband can also show her equality to him because she is not looking down at the floor as lower class women would. They are part of the Burgundian court life and in that system she is his equal, not his subordinate.|$|E

Kam is an ungrateful and sinister figure and she strives to her best to retrieve the six hundred million dollar fortune of the Tong family. Kam is a highly petty and arrogant figure. [...] She's a constant schemer when it comes to making plans to make the Tong family unhappy. She easily likes people that side with her and often surround herself with unsavory characters that appeases her ego and helps her scheme ways to get what she believes the Tong family has long over due owed her. She is a smart thinker when it comes to making plans to make the Tong family unhappy. She is an unhappy woman after thinking that she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>her</b> rightful position of the leading lady in Tong family; instead she is neglected by Hau in her cheeky ways.

Sandé always said that her education was the most important thing to her, stating if her music career was to fail, she <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>her</b> education to fall back on. Sandé said that her manager, Adrian Sykes, waited patiently since she was 16, saying [...] "Adrian really respects that I want to get an education behind me.

Panahi worked closely with Mohammadkhani, gaining her trust and acting out each scene for her to mimic while still adding her own personality to the performance. Panahi was most concerned about Mohammadkhani being able to cry on cue, so he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>her</b> stare at him off camera while he started to cry, causing her to cry. Filming began in early April 1994 in Kashan, Iran and continued until early June. Panahi has stated that during the making of his feature debut he [...] "wanted to prove to myself that I can do the job, that I can finish a feature film successfully and get good acting out of my players." [...] He also stated that [...] "In a world where films are made with millions of dollars, we made a film about a little girl who wants to buy a fish for less than a dollar – this is what we’re trying to show." [...] In Iran, films depicting children are the most likely to avoid censorship or political controversy, and The White Balloon was screened exclusively in theatres that specialized in children's films. Because of this the film had low attendance on its initial run in Iranian theatres, with only 130,000 tickets sold.|$|E
2500|$|Reading {{the words}} of [...] "And Cain spoke to Abel his brother," [...] a Midrash {{imagined}} the subject of their discussion. The Midrash taught that they divided the world between them.

The second told the first to strip off his clothes. The first retorted that the second should fly off his ground. Out of this quarrel, as [...] reports, [...] "Cain rose up against his brother Abel." [...] Rabbi Joshua of Siknin said in Rabbi Levi's name, however, that Cain and Abel quarreled because one said that the Temple would have to be built in his area, while the other claimed that {{it would have to be}} built in his. For [...] says, [...] "And it came to pass, when they were in the field," [...] and [...] "field" [...] refers to the Temple, as [...] equates the two when it says, [...] "Zion (that is, the Temple) shall be plowed as a field." [...] Out of this argument (in {{the words of}} [...] ), [...] "Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him." [...] Judah the son of Rabbi, however, said that their quarrel was about the first Eve. But Rabbi Aibu said that the first Eve had by then returned to dust. Rav Huna taught that Cain and Abel quarreled over an additional twin daughter who was born with Abel, whom each brother claimed for his own. Cain said that he <b>would</b> <b>have</b> <b>her,</b> because he was the firstborn, while Abel maintained that he would have to have her, because she was born with him.|$|E
