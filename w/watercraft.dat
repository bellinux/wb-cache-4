5|$|After the storm, 18,000 {{refugees}} from Mainland China became homeless. The official count was 45 casualties, 11 missing, and 127 injured, with most casualties coming from refugees. Overall, 462 small <b>watercraft</b> were damaged or destroyed.|$|E
5|$|A private {{concessioner}} provides tours {{from the}} Park headquarters {{into the bay}} and to the keys. Most tours are operated during the peak winter season from January to April. Personal <b>watercraft</b> are prohibited in Biscayne and most other national parks, but other private powerboats and sailboats are permitted.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{of these}} routes was {{suitable}} for heavy freight. Lighter cargoes were carried in York boats to Hudson Bay or in canoes {{on the border}} route. Both routes required navigation of large and hazardous lakes, shallow and rapid-strewn rivers, and swampy creeks and bogs, connected by numerous portages where both cargo and <b>watercraft</b> had to be carried on men's backs.|$|E
50|$|Human-powered <b>watercrafts</b> are <b>watercrafts</b> {{propelled}} by human power.|$|R
50|$|Recreational boating is {{very common}} in Lake Eugenia. Motorized and {{manually}} propelled <b>watercrafts</b> are accepted on the lake but speed boats must stay 30 metres away from shore. Common <b>watercrafts</b> include speed boats, fishing boats, kayaks, canoes, wind surfing boards and row boats.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Watercrafts</b> can be winterized {{and stored}} {{outdoors}} on in an indoor storage facility.|$|R
5|$|Scharnhorst and Gneisenau had a crew {{of between}} 56 to 60 {{officers}} and 1,613 to 1,780 enlisted men. The crew was augmented by another 10 officers and 61 men when serving as a squadron flagship. They carried a number of smaller <b>watercraft,</b> including two picket boats, two launches, two barges, two pinnaces, two cutters, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E
5|$|The {{heads-up display}} {{features}} a health meter, a radar and an ammunition count for secondary weapons. Depending on the level, the player can control several different air, {{land and water}} vehicles. Aircraft are the Naboo N-1 Starfighter, the Naboo Bomber and Police Cruiser, while land and <b>watercraft</b> are the Flash and Gian speeders, the Trade Federation Gunboat and the Heavy STAP. Each vehicle offers a unique armament arrangement, as well as varying degrees of speed and maneuverability. The game initially restricts the player to a particular craft for each level; however, after a level is completed, it can be replayed with any available craft that falls within its air, land or <b>watercraft</b> specification. Some levels offer the player the option to change craft mid-level. Seven bonus power-ups are hidden in different levels throughout the game. These bonuses improve a craft's weapons or durability and are applied to each eligible craft {{for the remainder of}} the game.|$|E
5|$|The meat, oil, bones, and skins are {{valuable}} items sold in markets. Mortality is often caused by direct hunting by humans or other human-induced causes, such as habitat destruction, entanglement in fishing gear, and <b>watercraft</b> collisions. Steller's sea cow went extinct due to overhunting in 1768.|$|E

Also on the lake are a boat ramp, boat dock and swimming area with a sand beach. The Forest Service allows only man-powered and electric-powered <b>watercraft</b> on the lake.|$|E
5|$|A {{statement}} {{issued by the}} National Weather Service advised people in nine Florida counties to complete hurricane preparations, which included securing loose objects and moving <b>watercraft</b> to safety. Homes along the coast were boarded up by their owners, while offshore, workers were removed from oil platforms. A spokesman for Royal Dutch Shell reported that 800 workers were to be evacuated. In New Orleans, emergency equipment was readied and inspected. The New Orleans Levee Board went into a second-stage alert on September 21, and cleared debris from floodwall openings.|$|E
5|$|All {{sirenians}} {{are protected}} by the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA), the Endangered Species Act (ESA), and the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). In addition to this, the four species are further protected by various specialty organizations. The Dugong is listed in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the Convention on Migratory Species, and the Coral Triangle Initiative. In Florida, manatees {{are protected by}} the Florida Manatee Sanctuary Act of 1978, which implements actions such as the limitation or prohibition of <b>watercraft</b> speeds where manatees exist.|$|E

5|$|At least 27vessels {{were damaged}} by the {{hurricane}} in Boston, with six <b>watercraft</b> having struck the South Boston Bridge, resulting in one death. Winds propelled several boats off of Gloucester out to sea, and their company was presumed to be lost. Ships elsewhere also withstood the hurricane's powerful gusts without much success– the Dove capsized at Ipswich Bar, killing seven people. The captain of the Hannah drowned at Cohasset and the vessel Mary was also beached, but the latter craft's crew survived. At Cape Cod, the Protector was swept inland near Highland Light, losing $100,000 (1804USD) in goods and leading to one death, while the John Harris capsized nearby, its crew perishing with it. Three bodies were also washed ashore at Plymouth, apparently from drowning at sea. Dozens of <b>watercraft</b> were driven aground at Salem, Cape Ann, and Marblehead, causing significant damage. At Abington, the storm's effects to local shipping activities were detrimental, with many vessels shipwrecked by high winds. Despite being heavily occupied, the port at New Bedford experienced no losses of ships or boats.|$|E
5|$|Different endings are {{possible}} {{based on the}} choice the player makes. The endings all involve a battle with the T. rex and escaping the island via a <b>watercraft</b> or helicopter. Regina survives in all endings but depending on the ending, other characters may die. If Regina chases Kirk, Gail reveals that the whole mission was a front and {{the government did not}} want Kirk, but instead wanted the Third Energy to use in warfare.|$|E
5|$|Environmental hazards {{induced by}} humans also puts {{sirenians}} at risk. Sirenians, especially the West Indian manatee, face high mortality from <b>watercraft</b> collision, {{and about half}} of all West Indian manatee deaths are caused by <b>watercraft</b> collisions. An increased usage of hydroelectric power and subsequent damming of rivers increase waterway traffic, which can lead to vessel collisions, and manatees may become entangled in navigational locks. The urbanized coastline of areas such as the Caribbean and Australia can result in the decline of seagrass populations. Reliable areas of warm water in Florida are generally the result of discharge from power plants, but newer plants with more efficient cooling systems may disrupt the pattern of warm water refuges, and an increased demand for artesian springs for water, the natural source of warm water, decreases the number of warm water refuges. Sirenians can be caught as bycatch from fisheries, and they can be seen as pests with the interference of local fishermen and the destruction of their nets. African manatees have also been known to venture into rice paddies and destroy the crops during the rainy season, and these confrontations with locals may lead to intentional culling of the manatees.|$|E

5|$|The British {{had been}} alerted to Arnold's {{approach}} and had destroyed {{all of the}} boats on the river's southern banks. Although two warships, the frigate Lizard (26 guns) and the sloop-of-war Hunter (16 guns), kept up a constant patrol to prevent a river crossing, Arnold was able to procure sufficient <b>watercraft</b> for his men, and crossed to the Quebec City side on November 11. He then realized his force was {{not strong enough to}} capture the city, so he retreated several miles and waited for Montgomery.|$|E
5|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the park is Lake Trahlyta. The lake has a swimming beach and boat launch for non-motorized <b>watercraft,</b> and offers seasonal rentals for pedal boats,kayaks, and paddle boards. It contains bass and bream and is stocked periodically during each trout season with about 5,000 trout. Also at the park are a general store, miniature golf course and a Civilian Conservation Corps museum.|$|E

Tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued along coastal areas of Texas and Louisiana. Pioneer Airlines removed its aircraft from Houston, while small <b>watercraft</b> were kept safe in port. Schools in Corpus Christi closed by October 3, as well as businesses in the threatened area.|$|E
5|$|Waterspouts {{have long}} been {{recognized}} as serious marine hazards. Stronger waterspouts pose threats to <b>watercraft,</b> aircraft and people. It is recommended to keep a considerable distance from these phenomena, and to always be on alert through weather reports. The United States National Weather Service will often issue special marine warnings when waterspouts are likely or have been sighted over coastal waters, or tornado warnings when waterspouts are expected to move onshore.|$|E
5|$|During late 1944 {{and early}} 1945 the Australian Army {{suffered}} from a shortage of shipping, leading to delays in moving heavy equipment and small <b>watercraft</b> from Australia to operational areas in the South West Pacific. While several British and United States vessels were eventually made available in mid-1945, the Australian Army's chief engineer, Major General Clive Steele, chose to design and build a heavy lift ship for the Army. Steele personally designed the ship, which was intended to support amphibious operations and transport supplies. He deliberately underestimated the project's cost {{in order to gain}} approval for the ship's design and construction.|$|E
50|$|The {{size of a}} <b>watercraft's</b> {{superstructure}} {{can have}} many implications {{in the performance of}} ships and boats, since these structures can alter their structural rigidity, their displacements, or both. These can be detrimental to any vessel's performance if they are taken into consideration incorrectly.|$|R
