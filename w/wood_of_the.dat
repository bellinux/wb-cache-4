5|$|The <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bending part of {{the limb}} ("dustar") must endure intense {{shearing}} stress, and denser woods such as hard maples are normally used in Turkish bows. Bamboo, and <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mulberry family, are traditional in China. Some composite bows have nonbending tips ("siyahs"), which need to be stiff and light; they may be made of woods such as Sitka spruce.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} World War II, Cedar Point {{was in need of}} {{financial}} help. The <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Cyclone roller coaster was rotting, the boardwalk was cracked in many places, and the fishing dock was in need of repair. In 1946, Cedar Point's oldest still-existing ride, the Midway Carousel, was installed. By 1951, the Cyclone coaster was razed because of its poor condition, leaving the resort without a roller coaster. As the Cyclone was being removed, the Laff-in-the-Dark, Rocket Ships, and Loop-A-Plane attractions were installed. Cedar Point Causeway was built in 1957, and is still in use. The president of Cedar Point, Bernie Zeiher, was replaced by George Roose around 1958, and Emile Legros was elected chairman that same year.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{deterioration}} of the <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exterior balconies over time, Queen RanavalonaII commissioned James Cameron to reinforce and encase the original structure in a stone shell in 1867. Cameron's exterior replaced the wooden balconies with stone walls three stories high. On each of the three floors, seven arched windows run the length of the two longer side walls while five windows illuminate the shorter front and back walls. A square tower stands at each of the four corners of the stone shell, extending above the level of the walls and forming their junction. A clock and bells were installed in the north-eastern tower.|$|E

5|$|Porcelain: Although glazed {{ceramics}} existed beforehand, {{the author}} and historian Samuel Adrian M Adshead writes that the earliest type of vitrified, translucent ceramics that {{could be classified as}} true porcelain was not made until the Tang Dynasty (618–907). The archaeologist Nigel <b>Wood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University of Oxford states that true porcelain was manufactured in northern China from roughly the beginning of the Tang Dynasty in the 7th century, while true porcelain was not manufactured in southern China until about 300 years later, during the early 10th century.|$|E
5|$|Riverside and Avondale {{are located}} to the {{southwest}} of Downtown Jacksonville along the St. Johns River. The neighborhood's boundaries are roughly Interstate 10 to the north, the St. Johns River to the east, Fishweir Creek to the south, and Roosevelt Boulevard and the CSX Railroad line to the west. It borders the Brooklyn and North Riverside neighborhoods to the north, Murray Hill to the west, and Lake Shore and Fairfax to the south. The boundary between Riverside and Avondale is not clear cut, even for those living in the neighborhood. It is sometimes given as Seminole Road and Belvedere Avenue, the northern limit of the Avondale Historic District. Alternately, author Wayne <b>Wood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Jacksonville Historic Landmarks Commission puts it at about McDuff Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Cheddar Wood and {{the smaller}} Macall's Wood form a {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest from {{what remains of the}} <b>wood</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bishops of Bath and Wells in the 13thcentury and of King Edmund the Magnificent's wood in the 10th. During the 19thcentury, its lower fringes were grubbed out to make strawberry fields. Most of these have been allowed to revert to woodland. The wood was coppiced until 1917. This site compromises a wide range of habitats which include ancient and secondary semi-natural broadleaved woodland, unimproved neutral grassland, and a complex mosaic of calcareous grassland and acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath. Cheddar Wood is one of only a few English stations for starved wood-sedge (Carex depauperata). Purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum), a nationally rare plant, also grows in the wood. Butterflies include silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia), dark green fritillary (Argynnis aglaja), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), holly blue (Celastrina argiolus) and brown argus (Aricia agestis). The slug Arion fasciatus, which has a restricted distribution in the south of England, and the soldier beetle Cantharis fusca also occur.|$|E

25|$|Species in {{the genus}} Echinodontium have a hydnaceous (with spinelike protuberances) hymenial surface, dimitic hyphal system, smooth basidiospores, and {{in three of}} four species, a {{symbiotic}} association with horntails — Sirex and Urocerus species.
