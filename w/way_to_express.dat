5|$|Matsueda {{is noted}} for her jazzy style, which she often {{incorporated}} into the soundtracks she worked on; she also touched on genres like jazz fusion, lounge, and ambient. For the scores that she collaborated on with Eguchi, she was {{responsible for most of}} the jazzy tracks, while Eguchi provided the majority of the electronic music. Matsueda has said that the best qualities of a composer are their curiosity and sensitivity, and that watching many things, listening, touching, and feeling are important factors in composition. When asked why she creates music, Matsueda replied that she feels it is an appropriate <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>express</b> herself.|$|E
5|$|The {{most natural}} and {{convenient}} <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>express</b> the relation involves the algebraic concept of exact sequences: sequences of objects (in this case groups) and morphisms (in this case group homomorphisms) between them {{such that the}} image of one morphism equals the kernel of the next. In general, this does not allow (co)homology groups of a space to be completely computed. However, because many important spaces encountered in topology are topological manifolds, simplicial complexes, or CW complexes, which are constructed by piecing together very simple patches, a theorem such as that of Mayer and Vietoris is potentially of broad and deep applicability.|$|E
5|$|Liliʻuokalani helped {{preserve}} {{key elements}} of Hawaii's traditional poetics while mixing in Western harmonies brought by the missionaries. A compilation of her works, titled The Queen's Songbook, was published in 1999 by the Queen Liliʻuokalani Trust. Liliʻuokalani used her musical compositions as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>express</b> her feelings for her people, her country, and {{what was happening in}} the political realm in Hawaii. One example of the way her music reflected her political views is her translation of the Kumulipo, the Hawaiian creation chant. While under house arrest, Liliʻuokalani feared she would never leave the palace alive, so she translated the Kumulipo in hopes that the history and culture of her people would never be lost. The ancient chants record her family's genealogy back to the origin story of Hawaii.|$|E

5|$|Show creator Daniel Knauf {{believed}} Carnivàles religious aspects {{stemmed from}} the epic {{of good and evil}} as a major fabric of the 1930s, while executive producer Ronald D. Moore regarded religion as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>express</b> the struggle of good versus evil, faith, and the nature of humanity. Neither the audience nor the actors were given advice on how to interpret the show's biblical imagery. Clancy Brown, the actor who portrayed Brother Justin, did not know whether his character was the Creature of Light or Darkness during the first season. He however thought that the visions made Brother Justin believe to be on a righteous mission of God until late in the first season. Compared to Brother Justin, Brown stated he practiced religion in moderate ways.|$|E
5|$|The Irish {{complaint}} against Wood {{was not that}} they had enough copper coins, but that this would introduce too many coins of inferior quality into the Irish economy. These coins would remove valuable silver and gold coins from circulation in the Irish economy, and since the new copper coins would not be minted under Irish authority, {{there was no way}} for the Irish to control the quality and amount. Also, Wood's coin was only one example of allegedly unfavourable economic practices that hurt Ireland; the Irish wanted to have their own national bank and authority to mint their own coinage, and Wood's coin became a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>express</b> their economic-nationalist desires.|$|E
25|$|A {{very strong}} <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>express</b> anger or {{frustration}} {{is to use}} the words tabarnak, sacrament, and câlice.

25|$|During Iqbal's stay in Heidelberg in 1907 his German {{professor}} Emma Wegenast {{taught him}} about Goethe's Faust, Heine and Nietzsche.

25|$|The Hadza did {{not have}} numerals before the {{introduction}} of Swahili language. Native numerals are itchâme 'one' and pie 'two'. Sámaka 'three' is a Datooga loan, and bone 'four', bothano 'five', and ikhumi 'ten' are Sukuma. Aso 'many' is commonly used instead of bothano for 'five'. There is no systematic <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>express</b> other numbers without using Swahili.|$|E

25|$|Moreover, {{the complex}} series of {{received}} signals considerably confused {{the reading of}} the LORAN signal, requiring some interpretation. Accuracy was more a matter of signal quality and operator experience than any fundamental limit of the equipment or signals. The only <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>express</b> the accuracy was to measure it in practice; average accuracy on the route from Japan to Tinian, a distance of , was , 2% of range.|$|E
25|$|Finnish, {{as other}} Uralic languages, has no <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>express</b> gender with pronouns. The Finnish hän has {{inspired}} {{the introduction of}} the Swedish hen pronoun. Finnish is basically a pronoun dropping language but in 3rd person singular it is common to use pronoun explicitly. Hän/he are only used about humans, while se/ne are used about animals, inanimate things, and sometimes about people, colloquially, a bit pejorative.|$|E
25|$|Early oriental artists created {{works that}} focused on design and spiritual {{interpretation}} of their subjects rather than realistic, three-dimensional representations. For centuries, eastern night paintings were spiritually and emotionally evocative works with unshaded, two-dimensional imagery. Like the western world, the moon, candles, and stars helped set the nocturnal scene. But there were also items, such as clothing and tree leaves, that might {{be used in a}} specific <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>express</b> nighttime from an eastern perspective.|$|E

25|$|Wills {{was known}} for his hollering and wisecracking. One source for this was when, as a very young boy, he would hear his father, grandfather, and cowboys give out loud cries when the music moved them. When asked if his wisecracking and talking on the bandstand came from his {{medicine}} show experience, he said it did not. Rather, he said that it came directly from playing and living close to Negroes, and that he never did it necessarily as show, but more as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>express</b> his feelings.|$|E
25|$|In this context, {{several women}} have joined guerrilla and rebel groups as a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>express</b> their {{rejection}} of the situation {{that they have been}} forced to live with. A famous Latin American female fighter was the second in command of the FMLN, commander Ana María of El Salvador. She was an intellectual woman and was considered as an icon among revolutionary women in the region. Eventually she was brutally killed by her own comrades on April 6, 1983 in Managua, Nicaragua, after having made many sacrifices during her life as a guerrilla. The FMLN blamed its leader Cayetano Carpio as the person responsible for the crime, and he committed suicide.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} Mayfield's Strange Fruit, a 90-minute opus based in 1920s Louisiana, came about {{on a visit}} to a {{photographic}} exhibit in Atlanta called Without Sanctuary: Lynching Photography in America in 2002. The exhibit features photographs from the book of the same name by Hilton Als and James Allen. With him was then-president of Dillard University and Michael Lomax, who later headed the United Negro College Fund. Lomax encouraged him to develop a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>express</b> the story through music. The piece was commissioned by Dillard University, and Mayfield took it to a number of historically black colleges and universities. The music combines jazz elements with negro spirituals and classical music. The show premiered at Dillard in 2003.|$|E

25|$|His {{first film}} as writer/director/star, Arirang (1926), was a {{national}} sensation in Korea. Films in Korea underwent censorship and restrictions by the Japanese authorities. Scripts had to be submitted to, {{and approved by the}} occupying Japanese government before they could be produced and distributed. Criticism of the government was censored, leading most films to be in the melodramatic, sentimental style known as shinpa. Na's innovation in Arirang was finding a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>express</b> Korean opposition to the Japanese occupation metaphorically by unifying the shinpa style with a spirit of nationalism. He thereby made cinema in Korea no longer mere entertainment, but a vehicle for an expression of national resistance to the Japanese occupation.|$|E
