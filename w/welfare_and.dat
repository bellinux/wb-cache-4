5|$|Since {{the court}} had no {{capacity}} to review {{the merits of the}} decision and conclude whether Jehovah's Witnesses were a threat to public order, it was sufficient that the Minister had made Order 179 with the view that the existence of Jehovah's Witnesses, which forbade national service, was contrary to public peace, <b>welfare</b> <b>and</b> good order. The judge also remarked that notion of public peace, <b>welfare</b> <b>and</b> good order in the SA was similar to the concept of public order envisaged by Article 15(4) of the Constitution.
