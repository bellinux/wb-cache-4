50|$|Davenport and Petter {{designed}} {{an aircraft}} to incorporate these features with unconventional results. The Lysander was {{powered by a}} Bristol Mercury air-cooled radial engine and had high wings and a fixed conventional landing gear faired inside large, streamlined spats. The spats had mountings for small, removable stub wings {{that could be used}} to carry light bombs or supply canisters. The wings had a reverse taper towards the root, which gave the impression of a bent gull wing from some angles, although the spars were straight. It had a girder type construction faired with a light wood stringers to give the aerodynamic shape. The forward fuselage was duralumin tube joined with brackets and plates, and the after part was <b>welded</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tubes.</b> Plates and brackets were cut from channel extrusions rather than forming from sheet steel. The front spar and lift struts were extrusions. The wing itself was fabric covered, and with its thickness maximized at the lift strut anchorage location, similar to that of later marks of the Stinson Reliant high-winged transport monoplane.|$|R

Shell anchors are made of longitudinally <b>welded</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> 17 240. The size of the production of all types of shell of concrete clamps is 18 000 PCs per year.

To the present day the grooves are made by cutting on a band saw, which is little productive and on finishing operations demanding way. The grooves in the coats of anchors will be newly manufactured by technology of shearing, which was a literary study. On the basis of the calculations was selected for the production a hydraulic press of CUPS 25 D. The grooves will be produced on the newly designed shearing tool.

40|$|The {{economy of}} pipe welding {{is governed by}} the welding speed. This {{is one reason why}} the laser {{technology}} in pipe welding is used in a production line only for the case of <b>welding</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> for the car industry because of the metallurgical advantages. However, using the effect of beam polarization, the welding speed could be increased. From laser beam cutting of metals, a strong effect of beam polarization referring to the cutting direction is known. In welding, this effect is relatively unknown. Experimental results show that a strong polarization effect could also take place in deep penetration welding if some threshold conditions are fulfilled. Using the right beam polarization e. g. pipes could be welded at a higher speed than with an unpolarized beam. It is possible to weld pipes or plates much faster than with the normal keyhole-welding technique if the polarized beam is used {{in a way that the}} beam is guided to the joining point. This new technique presented at the ICA LEO conference 88 / 1 / is described in the paper. Examples are shown which could be reached with standard 5 and 25 kw laser systems...|$|R
40|$|Cooling of the {{housings}} for the W 7 -X {{main field}} coils (MF coils) during cool-down and steady-state operation is investigated. The <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> coil housings are completely covered by copper sheet segments which are {{fixed to the}} surface by spot <b>welding.</b> A <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> cooling <b>tube</b> is soldered to this sheathing via suitable copper profile blocks {{on top of the}} outer housing circumference. Essentially, the cool-down of the coils including the adjoining structure is performed via the housings since the flow resistance of the cable-in-conduit-conductor would be too high. Moreover, the housing cooling during steady-state operation prevents heat incidence form outside to the coil winding. Conductor cooling is primarily used to stabilize the superconductor and to remove heat from inside the cable. (orig.)

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental investigation of concrete-filled cold-formed high strength <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> columns. The high strength <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> had a yield stress and tensile strength up to 536 and 961 MPa, respectively. The behaviour of the columns was investigated using different concrete cylinder strengths varied from 40 to 80 MPa. A {{series of tests}} was performed to investigate {{the effects of the}} shape of the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tube,</b> plate thickness and concrete strength on the behaviour and strength of concrete-filled high strength <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> columns. The high strength <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tubes</b> were cold-rolled into square and rectangular hollow sections. The depth-to-plate thickness ratio of the tube sections varied from 25. 7 for compact sections to 55. 8 for relatively slender sections. The columns had different lengths so the length-to-depth ratio generally remained at a constant value of 3. The concrete-filled high strength <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> specimens were subjected to uniform axial compression. The column strengths, load-axial strain relationships and failure modes of the columns were presented. The test strengths were compared with the design strengths calculated using the American specifications and Australian/New Zealand standards that consider the effect of local buckling using an effective width concept in the calculation of the <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> column strengths. Based on the test results, design recommendations were proposed for concrete-filled high strength <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> <b>tube</b> columns. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|AbstractAn ultra compact pulsed Nd:YAG laser with {{laser beam}} peak power of 3. 5 kW and 6. 5 ms pulse {{duration}} is employed {{to produce a}} butt joint and lap joint for both spot and seam <b>welding</b> on a <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> 304 specimen. The strength test of the weld joints is conducted by pulling the joint materials using INSTRON Series IX/s Automated Materials Tester System. From the experimental results, {{it is found that}} a butt joint produces much stronger attachment than a lap joint. The stronger attachment is contributed by a larger volume of <b>welded</b> <b>stainless</b> <b>steel</b> 304 at the joint interfaces. However, the strength of a lap joint can be increased by producing a deeper weld penetration depth. It is done by controlling the laser beam parameters such as laser peak power and pulse duration.
