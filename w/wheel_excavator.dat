40|$|Toothed gear power {{transmissions}} {{are complex}} mechanical systems and their design {{is a very}} challenging engineering task that requires the application of common calculation procedures and contemporary designing methods. Operating conditions of the gear power transmission are important for the design process from the aspect of overload prediction and they are defined within the design process by the operating condition factor KA, which has {{a wide range of}} values (1 to 2. 5), prescribing various operating situations. However, a good design of the toothed gear power transmission can be achieved if operating conditions are simulated and as such implemented in the calculation/design procedure. Such improvement in the design process can be done with the use of defined load spectra that accurately describe realistic operating conditions.
