25|$|So, Kant argues, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> two {{incompatible}} positions. From {{the perspective}} of practical reason, which is involved when we consider how to act, {{we have to take}} ourselves as free. But from {{the perspective of}} speculative reason, which is concerned with investigating the nature of the world of appearance, freedom is impossible. So <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> freedom on the one hand, and yet on the other hand we are also committed to a world of appearances that is run by laws of nature and has no room for freedom. We cannot give up on either. We cannot avoid taking ourselves as free when we act, and we cannot give up our picture of the world as determined by laws of nature. As Kant puts it, there is a contradiction between freedom and natural necessity. He calls this a dialectic of reason.|$|E

500|$|A {{screening}} for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo {{took place on}} November 28, 2011, {{as part of a}} critics-only event hosted by the New York Film Critics Circle. Commentators at the event predicted that while the film would become a contender for several accolades, it would likely not become a forerunner in the pursuit for Academy Award nominations. A promotional campaign commenced thereafter, including a Lisbeth Salander-inspired collection, designed by Trish Summerville for H. The worldwide premiere was at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on December 12, 2011, followed by the American opening at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on December 14 and Stockholm the next day. Sony's target demographics were men and women over the age of 25 and 17–34. The film went into general release in North America on December 21, at 2,700 theaters, expanding to 2,974 theaters on its second day. The United Kingdom release was on December 26, Russia on January 1, 2012, and Japan on February 13. India and Vietnam releases were abandoned due to censorship concerns. A press statement from the Central Board of Film Certification stated: [...] "Sony Pictures will not be releasing The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo in India. The censor board has judged the film unsuitable for public viewing in its unaltered form and, while <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> maintaining and protecting the vision of the director, we will, as always, respect the guidelines set by the board." [...] In contrast, the National Film Board of Vietnam insisted that the film's withdrawal had no relation to rigid censorship guidelines, as it had not been reviewed by the committee.|$|E

2500|$|The opium {{trade has}} been a {{continuing}} source of financing for the Taliban. Taliban insurgents force farmers to grow opium poppies to fund their operations. [...] Daud was recently quoted as saying, [...] ""The Taliban have forged an alliance with drug smugglers, providing protection for drug convoys and mounting attacks {{to keep the government}} away and the poppy flourishing." [...] General Mohammad Daud was further quoted in The New Yorker about this alliance, saying, [...] "There {{has been a}} coalition between the Taliban and the opium smugglers. This year, they have set up a commission to tax the harvest." [...] In return, he said, the Taliban had offered opium farmers protection from the government's eradication efforts. The switch in strategy has an obvious logic: it provides opium money for the Taliban to sustain itself and helps it to win over the farming communities. [...] In a continued effort to curb the opium trade in Afghanistan Mohammed Duad reported in June 2008 that police in Kabul set fire to 7.5 tonnes of narcotics. In April 2009, the Afghan anti-drug officers burned more than six-and-a-half tons of seized heroin, opium, hashish and drug-manufacturing chemicals worth up to £70 million on the UK market.

And whether it’s in school books that teach how to kill Jews, or whether it’s in the political discourse that is spoken either from Fatah or from Hamas, there is a belief that the Jewish people do not have a right to have a Jewish state." [...] Romney added, [...] "There are some people who say should we have a two state solution, and the Israelis would be happy [...] to have a two state solution. It's the Palestinians who don't want a two state solution, they want to eliminate the state of Israel. And I believe America must say the best way to have peace in the Middle East is not for us to vacillate and appease, but it is to say we stand with our friend Israel. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> a Jewish state in Israel. We will not have an inch of difference between ourselves and our ally Israel."

60|$|But {{indifference}} {{will not}} guide nations through civilization {{to the establishment}} of the perfect city of God. An indifferent statesman is a contradiction in terms; and a statesman who is indifferent on principle, a Laisser-faire or Muddle-Through doctrinaire, plays the deuce with us in the long run. Our statesmen must get a religion by hook or crook; and as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> Adult Suffrage it must be a religion capable of vulgarization. The thought first put into words by the Mills when they said 'There is no God; but this is a family secret,' and long held unspoken by aristocratic statesmen and diplomatists, will not serve now; for the revival of civilization after the war cannot be effected by artificial breathing: the driving force of an undeluded popular consent is indispensable, and will be impossible until the statesman can appeal to the vital instincts of the people in terms of a common religion. The success of the Hang the Kaiser cry at the last General Election shews us very terrifyingly how a common irreligion can be used by myopic demagogy; and common irreligion will destroy civilization unless it is countered by common religion.|$|E
