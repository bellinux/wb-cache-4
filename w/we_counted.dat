500|$|<b>We</b> <b>counted</b> 116 {{pieces of}} cannon, heavy and light, {{but all of}} these pieces, with the {{exception}} of one heavy battery of 16 guns , are en barbette, and the crews of the guns are utterly unprotected from shell, canister, or rifle bullets. [...] As regards the heavy 16-gun casemated battery, the embrasures appear to be wrongly constructed, according to modern ideas on such subjects, the large aperture of the embrasure facing the enemy, and becoming an excellent target for riflemen, almost all of whose bullets must tell on the crew of the gun within.|$|E
500|$|Chimes, {{whose career}} {{aspirations}} owed {{little to the}} punk ethos, had left the band again soon after the recording sessions. He later said, [...] "The point was I wanted one kind of life and they wanted another and, like, why are we working together, if we want completely different things?" [...] As a result, only Simonon, Jones and Strummer were featured on the album's cover, and Chimes was credited as [...] "Tory Crimes". Strummer later described what followed: [...] "We must have tried every drummer that then had a kit. I mean every drummer in London. I think <b>we</b> <b>counted</b> 205. And that's why we were lost until we found Topper Headon." [...] Headon, who had played briefly with Jones's London SS, was nicknamed [...] "Topper" [...] by Simonon, who felt he resembled the Topper comic book character Mickey the Monkey. An excellent musician, Headon could also play piano, bass and guitar. The day after he signed up, he declared, [...] "I really wanted to join the Clash. I {{want to give them}} even more energy than they've got—if that's possible"; interviewed over two decades later, he said his original plan was to stay briefly, gain a name for himself, and then move on to a better gig. In any event, Strummer later observed, [...] "Finding someone who not only had the chops, but the strength and the stamina to do it was just the breakthrough for us".|$|E
2500|$|The French retreated fitfully in {{the sweltering}} heat, {{burdened}} with some 500 wagons of loot and 1,200 ill. A French surgeon remarked: [...] "Our little army carried enough baggage for 150,000 men. Mere captains required wagons drawn by four mules. <b>We</b> <b>counted</b> more than 50 wagons per battalion, {{the result of}} the plunder of Córdoba. All our movements were impeded. We owed our defeat to the greed of our generals." [...] General Gobert's division set out from Madrid on July 2 to add weight to Dupont's expedition. However, only one brigade of his division ultimately reached Dupont, the rest being needed to hold the road north against the guerrillas.|$|E

[...] Increasing those levels was not considered in depth as it was not considered a viable option. Panel members say they were not given a mandate to consider increasing the number of American troops in Iraq because their military briefers dismissed out of hand the premise {{that it was possible to}} increase the number of American troops in Iraq, on grounds that not enough were available. The report recommends instead envisaging the removal of all U.S. troops from Iraq by 2008.|$|E

We solve this problem also for transpositions. In this case, there is little evidence to justify a link between some permutations, partial transpose, and certain domino tilings...|$|R
