5|$|As {{the rise}} of grunge began to phase punk and {{hardcore}} out of the Northwest underground by the late 1980s, Perry set out to start a band that stood in defiant contrast to the shoegazing attitude of alternative rock, showcasing high energy dance music and Zappa-esque theatricality {{in an attempt to}} create something that an audience would react to viscerally instead of passively. Recruiting a horn section led by alto saxophonist Brooks Brown, Perry and Schmid formed their latest band Mr. <b>Wiggles</b> – named after a Parliament song – in November 1988, playing their first show in Springfield as part of a benefit concert for workers of the Nicolai door manufacturing plant, who were then engaged in a union strike.|$|E

5|$|The outer Adams ring, with an orbital {{radius of}} about 63,930km, {{is the best}} studied of Neptune's rings. It is named after John Couch Adams, who {{predicted}} the position of Neptune independently of Le Verrier. This ring is narrow, slightly eccentric and inclined, with total width of about 35km (15–50km), and its normal optical depth is around 0.011±0.003 outside the arcs, which corresponds to the equivalent depth of about 0.4km. The fraction of dust in this ring is from 20% to 40%—lower than in other narrow rings. Neptune's small moon Galatea, which orbits just inside of the Adams ring at 61,953km, acts like a shepherd, keeping ring particles inside a narrow range of orbital radii through a 42:43 outer Lindblad resonance. Galatea's gravitational influence creates 42 radial <b>wiggles</b> in the Adams ring with an amplitude of about 30km, which {{have been used to}} infer Galatea's mass.|$|E
