40|$|How do rising {{levels of}} {{international}} interconnectedness affect social, economic, and political conditions for women? Research on gender and international relations frequently offers clear propositions but seldom submits them to broad, quantitative testing. This article begins {{to fill that}} gap. We advance the hypothesis that, on balance and over time, increasing cross-national exchange and communication lead to improvements in <b>women</b> <b>s</b> <b>status</b> and equality. Economic aspects of globalization can bring new opportunities and resources to women. But equally important, globalization promotes the diffusion of ideas and norms of equality for women. In an analysis of 180 countries from 1975 to 2000, employing cross-sectional time-series regression techniques, we {{examine the impact of}} several measures of globalization on <b>women</b> <b>s</b> levels of life expectancy, literacy, and participation in the economy and parliamentary office. International trade, foreign direct investment, membership in the United Nations (UN) and World Bank, and ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), are associated with improved conditions for women.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{causes of}} death among women of reproductive age; to determine MMR; to review death notification and registration procedures, and to examine the fate and status of under- 5 motherless orphans in the West Bank. Methods: All reported deaths (n= 431) of women 15 - 49 years old during 2000 - 2001 in the West Bank area of OPT were investigated. Data were collected from official agencies and through interviewing the deceased <b>women</b> <b>s</b> relatives using the verbal autopsy approach in all 10 West Bank districts over a period between January 2000 until June 2002. Data on circumstantial events related to death and {{causes of death}} were analysed. An avoidability analysis of maternal deaths was performed, and deaths were classified as unavoidable, preventable and treatable. Motherless under- 5 orphans were investigated after {{an average of three}} years following their mothers deaths by interviewing custodians/ caretakers. Orphans weight and height were measured; wasting and stunting rates were calculated and analyzed. The quality of death notification sheets and timeliness of death notification and registration was assessed and analysed. Results: The overall reproductive-age mortality rate ranged between 45 and 48 per 100, 000 women. Malignant and circulatory system diseases were the most common causes of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> reproductive age deaths while 8 % were pregnancy related. MMR in the West Bank was calculated at around 29 - 36 deaths per 100, 000 live births. Cardiovascular diseases and haemorrhage were the most common causes of maternal death and 69 % of these were classified as avoidable. The reproductive death rate among single never-married women was 39 per 100, 000 single women, and at time of death, 41 % were under 25 years. Violent deaths and suicide among single women was almost twice as high as among married women. With the exception of three neonatal deaths, all motherless orphans traced were alive after about 3 years following their mothers death. Anthropometric measurement of the orphans revealed that 8. 8 % and 17. 6 % of under- 5 orphans were wasted and stunted, respectively, and all malnourished orphans were girls. Death notification sheets were incomplete in 78 % of cases, and notification and registration of 36 % of deaths were significantly delayed. Conclusion: The majority of maternal deaths were avoidable. Substandard care and misclassification of maternal deaths remain significant problems with negative repercussions on efforts to reduce maternal mortality. More qualitative research into critical issues of single <b>women</b> <b>s</b> <b>status</b> in Palestinian society focussing on health care-seeking patterns and barriers to appropriate reproductive and other health care should be considered. The higher proportion of violent deaths and suicide among the deceased single women is a serious indication of their vulnerability. Close monitoring and support to the motherless orphans health and nutritional status with a special emphasis on orphan girls should be ensured. Death notification and registration procedures need to be critically reviewed...|$|R
40|$|Verbal {{surveys are}} the most common way of gauging any {{population}} <b>s</b> health <b>status,</b> but questions remain regarding the accuracy of the responses they elicit. The present paper compares <b>women</b> <b>s</b> self-reports regarding their experiences with reproductive tract infections (RTIs) and the medical diagnosis that they went through to ascertain the presence or otherwise of the infections.

Some of the selfreported symptoms were pathogenic in nature, as represented by the true positive reports, but the majority of the self-reports were false positives when compared to medical diagnosis.

40|$|Most {{studies on}} women 2 Ì† 7 <b>s</b> <b>status</b> focus on {{status as a}} unitary {{construct}} and search for a universal explanation of the low status of women. Recognizing the inadequacies of such research the present study focuses on the multi-dimensionality of the concept and argues that {{the complexity of the}} phenomena makes it necessary to conceptualize status broadly in terms of its economic, social, and political dimensions. The contrasting performance of specific states/districts on each dimension clearly indicates that the dynamic and variable nature of women 2 Ì† 7 <b>s</b> <b>status</b> cannot be captured by any one dimension. ^ Further, a structural approach is used to analyze the regional variations in women 2 Ì† 7 s position in India across each dimension because such a framework, stressing economic context and socio-cultural factors, reveals the complex and multilayered nature of the processes that affect women 2 Ì† 7 s position. It is observed that women 2 Ì† 7 <b>s</b> <b>status</b> is affected by kinship structures, development levels, and social stratification, which vary over space and time individually and in interaction with each other. It is this variation that leads to differences in women 2 Ì† 7 s position from one region of India to another. ^ The findings of the study suggest {{that it is important to}} recognize the mutual interdependence of gender relations, development levels, and social stratification without underestimating the full significance of each in Indian society. In some cases kinship patterns interact with economic development to produce major spatial variations in women 2 Ì† 7 <b>s</b> <b>status,</b> and in others, it is the development levels and social stratification that has the greatest influence. For instance, kinship structures appear to be the most powerful factor in affecting women 2 Ì† 7 <b>s</b> economic <b>status,</b> while the social dimension of women 2 Ì† 7 <b>s</b> <b>status</b> is greatly affected by the varying development levels. And finally, political socialization appears to have the largest impact on women 2 Ì† 7 <b>s</b> political <b>status.</b> This reiterates not only the independence of these dimensions but also the important role of 2 Ì† 7 place 2 Ì† 7 in the constitution of gender differences in India. ...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This PhD takes a social constructionist approach (see Burr, 2003) to explore how professional women in Sri Lanka make sense of and enact their careers. By explaining career through the recursive relationship between social context and individual agency, this study adds new insights into existing understandings of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers which are dominated by psychological models of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> development over their lifespans (see Maneiro and Sullivan, 2005; O Neil and Bilimoria, 2005; Pringle and Dixon, 2003). Most importantly this study which addresses <b>women</b> <b>s</b> experiences in Sri Lanka fulfils a significant gap in the extant literature which has paid only little attention to careers in South Asian nations. This study is based on qualitative interviews (see King, 2004) conducted with 24 professional Sri Lankan women: eight in early career, eight in mid-career and eight in late career (see O Neil and Bilimoria, 2005). All respondents aspired to reach the highest possible level in their organisations hierarchies and therefore continuously engaged with work organisations, home and family and wider contextual structures in Sri Lanka in pursuit of achieving their career goals, contributing towards maintaining and/or transforming these social structures in the process. Based on these findings I developed a theoretical framework to understand <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers in a dynamic and contextually significant manner. This framework highlights eight different strategies women use to develop their careers which has four possible social outcomes. In illuminating specifically what women do to advance their careers within their social contexts and with what implications this framework makes {{a significant contribution to}} the careers literature which gives only little attention to individuals career strategies. Moreover by appreciating both social context and individual agency as explanations of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers this model refrains from taking an overly deterministic (see McRae, 2003; Crompton, 2011) or voluntaristic (see Maneiro and Sullivan, 2005; O Neil and Bilimoria, 2005) stance to conceptualising <b>women</b> <b>s</b> career development. Second, I outline a South Asian model of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> career development highlighting family, moral notions, religious philosophies and wider belief systems such as astrology and horoscopes as central constituents of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers. I highlight how these understandings could be used to identify blind spots in existing literature and further develop prevailing ideas of <b>women</b> <b>s</b> careers in the West. Specifically I argue that traditional notions do not altogether disappear as societies develop (see Gerth and Mills, 1991), but rather individuals use these notions to walk towards modernity. Finally I conclude the thesis by outlining how scholars could develop my work further, calling upon authors to bring moral character, traditional notions and enchantment back to the careers field.

The women arrived in Sweden in their teens and attended Swedish upper secondary school, completed their education with good results, applied for and were enrolled as students at University. The <b>women</b> <b>s</b> descriptions are studied as individual interpetations. Description and analysis are based on symbolic interactionalism, based on the concepts interaction, empathy, self- image, confirmation and congruousness/ incongruousness. Also conceptions focusing on schooling are required. These conceptions are connected to the symbolic interactionalistic perspective and to Code theory by Bernstein. Conceptions used are career turning points, integration and inclusion, motivation, framing, and visible and invisible pedagogy. The school years and school careers have been affected by, and are thus related to, migration. The descriptions are analysed within the dimensions of ethnical background, gender and class. The material consists of thematically structured in-depth interviews with twelve women. The interviews were subsequently constructed as case-studies. Interactive patterns on structural, institutional and individual levels were identified in the analyse.
