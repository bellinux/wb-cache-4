5|$|AML {{has several}} subtypes; {{treatment}} and prognosis vary among subtypes. AML is cured in 35–40% of people under 60 {{years old and}} 5–15% over 60 years old. Older people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> able to withstand intensive chemotherapy have an average survival of 5–10 months.|$|E

50|$|In German usage, {{university}} students applied the term Philister (Philistine) {{to describe a}} person <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> trained at university; in the German social context, the term identified the man (Philister) and the woman (Philisterin) <b>who</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> of the university social set.|$|R
50|$|Milne {{created the}} story to contain believable, {{three-dimensional}} characters, rather than the stereotypes which will satisfy children. Hence the book introduces us to a princess <b>who</b> <b>is</b> far from helpless; a prince <b>who,</b> whilst handsome, <b>is</b> also pompous and vain; an enchantment which is almost entirely humorous; a villain <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> entirely villainous and receives no real comeuppance; a good king <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> always good; an evil king <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> always evil, and so on. The result is a book which children may not enjoy as much as adults.|$|R

5|$|All {{those with}} a risk of {{exposure}} to body fluids such as blood should be vaccinated, if not already. Testing to verify effective immunization is recommended and further doses of vaccine are given to those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> sufficiently immunized. In 10- to 22-year follow-up studies there were no cases of hepatitis B among {{those with a}} normal immune system who were vaccinated. Only rare chronic infections have been documented.|$|E
5|$|Although women {{faced with}} double burden usually have more stress than most women in today's society, it was proven {{that in most}} cases they are psychologically {{healthier}} than women <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> faced with these circumstances, for either being a stay at home mother or for being a working woman without children to take care of.|$|E

5|$|Arabians are {{versatile}} {{horses that}} compete in many equestrian fields, including horse racing, the horse show disciplines of saddle seat, Western pleasure, and hunt seat, {{as well as}} dressage, cutting, reining, endurance riding, show jumping, eventing, youth events such as equitation, and others. They are used as pleasure riding, trail riding, and working ranch horses for those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> interested in competition.|$|E
5|$|For people <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> {{eligible}} for a stem cell transplant, immunotherapy {{with a combination of}} histamine dihydrochloride (Ceplene) and interleukin 2 (Proleukin) after the completion of consolidation has been shown to reduce the absolute relapse risk by 14%, translating to a 50% increase in the likelihood of maintained remission.|$|E
5|$|For {{people with}} relapsed AML, the only proven {{potentially}} curative therapy is a {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplant, if one has not already been performed. In 2000, the monoclonal antibody-linked cytotoxic agent gemtuzumab ozogamicin (Mylotarg) was approved in the United States for people aged more than 60 years with relapsed AML <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> candidates for high-dose chemotherapy. This drug was voluntarily withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer, Pfizer in 2010.|$|E

With the plains zebra, the males in a bachelor group have strong bonds and have a linear dominance hierarchy. Fights between males usually occur over estrus females and involve biting and kicking.|$|E
5|$|It {{is perhaps}} no {{accident}} that the factuality of the Italian Renaissance has been most vigorously questioned by those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> obliged to take a professional interest in the aesthetic aspects of civilization—historians of economic and social developments, political and religious situations, and, most particularly, natural science—but only exceptionally by students of literature and hardly ever by historians of Art.|$|E

5|$|Recent {{improvements}} in targeting and imaging {{have led to}} the development of stereotactic radiation in the treatment of early-stage lung cancer. In this form of radiotherapy, high doses are delivered over a number of sessions using stereotactic targeting techniques.

5|$|The Catholic Church calls {{all members}} to {{practise}} chastity {{according to their}} state in life.

It requires refraining from lust, masturbation, fornication, pornography, prostitution and, especially, rape. Chastity for those <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> married requires living in continence, abstaining from sexual activity; those who are married are called to conjugal chastity.|$|E

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} may be suspected on {{the basis}} of the history and examination. To confirm the diagnosis, as well as excluding alternative causes, several investigations are required; more investigations may be performed if the history is not typical or the patient is more likely to have an alternative problem: children, men, the elderly, or women <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> overweight.|$|E
5|$|Today all {{cardinals}} {{are required}} to be bishops, but priests named cardinal at an advanced age often petition the Pope for an exception to this rule. Bruno Heim says that since the cross is one heraldic emblem that only bishops {{have the right to}} bear, cardinals <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> bishops do not use it. Notable examples are Cardinals Albert Vanhoye and Avery Dulles; the latter's arms do display a cross.|$|E
5|$|Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis may be problems. The {{cost and}} {{difficulty}} of screening and assessment can delay diagnosis. Conversely, the increasing popularity of drug treatment options {{and the expansion}} of benefits has motivated providers to overdiagnose ASD.
