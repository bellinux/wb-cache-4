40|$|AbstractThe {{idea that}} {{tunneling}} {{is enhanced by}} the compression of the donor–acceptor distance has attracted significant interest. In particular, recent studies argued that this proposal is consistent with pressure effects on enzymatic reactions, and that the observed pressure effects {{support the idea of}} vibrationally <b>enhanced</b> <b>catalysis.</b> However, a careful analysis of the current works reveals serious inconsistencies in the evidence presented to support these hypotheses. Apparently, tunneling decreases upon compression, and external pressure does not lead to the applicable compression of the free energy surface. Additionally, pressure experiments do not provide actual evidence for vibrationally <b>enhanced</b> <b>catalysis.</b> Finally, the temperature dependence of the entropy change in hydride transfer reactions is shown to reflect simple electrostatic effects...|$|R

40|$|This review {{summarizes}} {{our recent}} {{findings on the}} role of mineral salts in prebiotic RNA synthesis, which is catalyzed by montmorillonite clay minerals. The clay minerals not only catalyze the synthesis of RNA but also facilitate homochiral selection. Preliminary data of these findings have been presented at the “Horizontal Gene Transfer and the Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA) ” conference at the Open University, Milton Keynes, UK, 5 – 6 September 2013. The objective of this meeting was to recognize the significance of RNA in LUCA. We believe that the prebiotic RNA synthesis from its monomers must have been a simple process. As a first step, it may have required activation of the 5 '-end of the mononucleotide with a leaving group, e. g., imidazole in our model reaction (Figure 1). Wide ranges of activating groups are produced from HCN under plausible prebiotic Earth conditions. The final step is clay mineral catalysis in the presence of mineral salts to facilitate selective production of functional RNA. Both the clay minerals and mineral salts would have been abundant on early Earth. We have demonstrated that while montmorillonite (pH 7) produced only dimers from its monomers in water, addition of sodium chloride (1 M) enhanced the chain length multifold, as detected by HPLC. The effect of monovalent cations on RNA synthesis was of the following order: Li+ > Na+ > K+. A similar effect was observed <b>with</b> the anions, <b>enhancing</b> <b>catalysis</b> in the following order: Cl− > Br− > I−. The montmorillonite-catalyzed RNA synthesis was not affected by hydrophobic or hydrophilic interactions. We thus show that prebiotic synthesis of RNA from its monomers was a simple process requiring only clay minerals and a small amount of salt...|$|R

40|$|The {{modification}} of silver paste electrodes {{with a combination}} of dodecyl benzenesulphonic acid and KCl has been shown to lead to significant enhancements of the electrochemical reduction of hydrogen peroxide.

Physical analysis showed modifications to both the surface morphology and chemical composition of the silver paste electrode surface. However, BET analysis revealed no significant change in surface area.

The impact of electrothermal annealing on the electrocatalytic activity towards (i) oxygen reduction and (ii) glucose oxidation in pH 7 phosphate buffered aqueous solutions is investigated. In contrast to as-received platinum, annealed platinum produces an electrocatalytic response towards glucose oxidation with increasing glucose concentration.

In the case of low temperature discharges, the conversion is carried out at ambient temperature which in effect trades high temperature thermal energy for electric energy as the driving force for conversion. The low operating temperatures relax the thermodynamic constraints on the product distribution found at high temperatures and also remove the requirements of large thermal masses required for current technologies.

An analysis of the substrate selectivity of the mutant enzymes indicates that alterations to the phosphate-binding site of KDPG aldolase changes the substrate selectivity. We report mutations that <b>enhance</b> <b>catalysis</b> of aldol cleavage of substrates lacking a phosphate moiety and demonstrate that electrophile reactivity correlates with the hydrophobicity of the substituted side chain. These mutations improve the selectivity for unnatural substrates as compared to KDPG by up to 2000 -fold.

40|$|Regulation of the c-Abl (ABL 1) {{tyrosine}} kinase {{is important because}} of its role in cellular signaling, and its relevance in the leukemiogenic counterpart (BCR-ABL). Both auto-inhibition and full activation of c-Abl are regulated by {{the interaction of the}} catalytic domain with the Src Homology 2 (SH 2) domain. The mechanism by which this interaction <b>enhances</b> <b>catalysis</b> is not known. We combined computational simulations with mutagenesis and functional analysis to find that the SH 2 domain conveys both local and global effects on the dynamics of the catalytic domain. Locally, it regulates the flexibility of the aC helix in a fashion reminiscent of cyclins in cyclin-dependent kinases, reorienting catalytically important motifs. At a more global level, SH 2 binding redirects the hinge motion of the N and C lobes and changes the conformational equilibrium of the activation loop. The complex network of subtle structural shifts that link the SH 2 domain with the activation loop and the active site may be partially conserved with other SH 2 -domain containing kinases and therefore offer additional parameters for the design of conformation-specific inhibitors...|$|R

Meetings with the authors of the previously published work led to the conjecture that their catalyst was not being prepared properly, leading to anomalously low selectivity for their conventional heating runs. An optical temperature diagnostic suitable for use on a microwave applicator was developed and characterized in this project. This pyrometer can measure the temperature of small scale features on the catalyst bed, and it has a fast response that can follow the rapid heating often encountered in a microwave processing system.

Molybdenum nitride has been recently reported to interact synergistically with gold to show an enhanced activity for the electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (2 H(+) + 2 e(-) -> H- 2, HER). In this work, we elucidated the roles of nitrogen, carbon, molybdenum and gold on this observed phenomenon.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the properties of cobalamin complexes with imidazolate using the density functional B 3 LYP method, In particular, we have compared imidazolate (Imm) with imidazole and 5, 6 -dimethylbenzimidazole (DMB), and studied how constraints in the axial Co-N bond length may affect {{the strength of the}} Co-C bond. The results show that the optimum Co-N-Imm bond is similar to 0. 2 Angstrom shorter than that of imidazole. There is no indication from crystal structures that the histidine ligand would be deprotonated in the enzymes. However, it is likely that it attains some imidazolate character through its hydrogen bond to a conserved aspartate residue. The Co-N bond with imidazolate is three times more rigid than that with imidazole or DMB, but twice as flexible as the Co-C bond. Constraints in the Co-N-Imm bond length give rise to a larger change in the corrin conformation than imidazole, but smaller than for DMB. The resulting effect for the Co-C bond dissociation energy is larger for imidazolate than for imidazole or DMB. However, even the largest reasonable distortion can only <b>enhance</b> <b>catalysis</b> by 15 kJ mol(- 1).
