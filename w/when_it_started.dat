5|$|The AFM {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} Pentecostal {{movement}} is South Africa with roots in the Azusa Street Revival, the Holiness Movement teachings of Andrew Murray and the teachings of John Alexander Dowie. The AFM had an interracial character <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>started,</b> but, as in American Pentecostalism, this interracial cooperation was short-lived. The decades from the 1950s to the 1980s were marked by the implementation of apartheid. After 1994, the white AFM moved rapidly towards unification with the black churches. By 1996, all the AFM churches were united in a single multi-racial church.|$|E

5|$|Baccano! is a 2007 anime series {{directed}} by Takahiro Omori and produced by Brain's Base and Aniplex. The 16 episodes are {{adapted from the}} light novels {{of the same name}} written by Ryohgo Narita and illustrated by Katsumi Enami. Told in out-of-order sequences, the story spans three consecutive years of Prohibition-era America during which three seemingly unconnected events occur: two bottles of immortality elixir are passed around Manhattan by gangsters believing it is alcohol, a supposed monster massacres members of two gangs attempting to hijack the transcontinental train Flying Pussyfoot, and a man is tracked down by his sister and a gang. The first thirteen episodes aired in Japan from July 26, 2007 to November 1, 2007 on WOWOW, a Japanese pay-per-view station, and the final three were released direct-to-DVD. The series made its North American television debut <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>started</b> airing on the Funimation Channel after the channel transitioned to HD in September 2010.|$|E

5|$|In early 1944, Morotai {{became an}} area of {{importance}} to the Japanese military <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>started</b> developing the neighbouring larger island of Halmahera as {{a focal point for}} the defence of the southern approaches to the Philippines. In May 1944, the Imperial Japanese Army's 32nd Division arrived at Halmahera to defend the island and its nine airstrips. The division had suffered heavy losses when the convoy carrying it from China (the Take Ichi convoy) was attacked by US submarines. Two battalions from the 32nd Division's 211th Infantry Regiment were initially deployed to Morotai to develop an airstrip on the Doroeba Plain. Both battalions were withdrawn to Halmahera in mid-July, however, when the airstrip was abandoned because of drainage problems. Allied code breakers detected the Japanese build up at Halmahera and Morotai's weak defenses, and passed this information on to the relevant planning staff.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} year of operation, the line had 60,850 passengers, {{significantly}} over expectations. After the opening, there were five daily round trips. In 1939, the extension of the longest tunnel started, because the nearby section was subject to landslides. It was completed by the German occupational forces during World War II, but not taken into use by the railway until 1945 because of the German military's use of the tunnel as an ammunition depot. Because of the electric traction, the line was not affected by the lack of coal during World War II, and in 1945 it had 285,900 passengers. After the end of the war, the number of daily round trips increased to seven, but this was reduced to six in the 1950s. In 1955, a morning and evening coach service started between Granvin and Voss. It was further extended in 1968, <b>when</b> <b>it</b> <b>started</b> corresponding with services on the Bergen Line.|$|E
