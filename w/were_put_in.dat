5|$|A {{technique}} was developed that combined the front projection effect with specially designed zoom lenses. The illusion of movement {{was created by}} zooming in on Reeve while making the front projected image appear to recede. For scenes where Superman interacts with other people or objects while in flight, Reeve and actors <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> a variety of rigging equipment with careful lighting and photography. This also {{led to the creation}} of the Zoptic system.|$|E
5|$|Before troop {{transportation}} began, all of {{the ships}} were hastily refitted. Of the fourteen ships, four, including Montanan and Dakotan, were designated to carry animals and other cargo; the other ten were designated to carry troops. Ramps and stalls were built on the four ships chosen to carry livestock. Gun platforms were installed on each ship before docking at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, where the guns <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> place. All the ships were manned by merchant officers and crews but carried two U.S. Navy officers, Navy gun crews, quartermasters, signalmen, and wireless operators. The senior Navy officer on board would take control if a ship came under attack.|$|E

5|$|Erie was an {{important}} shipbuilding, fishing, and railroad hub during the mid-19th century. The city was the site where three sets of track gauges met. While the delays engendered cargo troubles for commerce and travel, they provided much-needed local jobs in Erie. When a national standardized gauge was proposed, those jobs, {{and the importance of}} the rail hub itself, <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> jeopardy. In an event known as the Erie Gauge War, the citizens of Erie, led by the mayor, set fire to bridges, ripped up track and rioted to try to stop the standardization.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane {{warnings}} <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> {{effect for}} six provinces in southeastern Cuba, where significant precipitation ranging up to 20inches (500mm) across the mountainous south was expected {{as the center}} of Ernesto tracked slowly across Cuba. Cuban officials evacuated 300,000people and brought its fishing fleet into harbors. The Cuban state television broadcast extensive warnings about the storm, urging precautions. Cattle were moved to higher ground, tourists were evacuated from hotels in the southeastern province of Granma, and baseball games scheduled for the evening of August 27 in Havana were played earlier in the day. The threat of the storm caused domestic flights to be canceled.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Bill Woodfull led Australia back to England on a {{tour that}} had been under a cloud after the tempestuous cricket {{diplomacy}} of the previous bodyline series. Jardine had retired from International cricket in early 1934 after captaining a fraught tour of India and under England's new captain, Bob Wyatt, agreements <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> place so that bodyline would not be used. However, there were occasions when the Australians felt that their hosts had crossed the mark with tactics resembling bodyline.|$|E

However, there were occasions when the Australians felt that their hosts had crossed the mark with tactics resembling bodyline.|$|E
5|$|In January 1894, the Fasci were outlawed and brutally {{repressed}} on {{the orders}} of Prime Minister Francesco Crispi. Many leaders <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> jail; Cascioferro fled to Tunis for a year. After serving his sentence {{for his role in}} the peasant unrest, Cascioferro returned to a position of social power and pressured authorities in Palermo to put him in charge of granting emigration permits in the district of Corleone. According to Mafia historian Salvatore Lupo, Cascioferro was involved in clandestine emigration networks.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparations}} {{for his next}} campaign, Germanicus sent Publius Vitellius and Gaius Antius to collect taxes in Gaul, and instructed Silius, Anteius, and Caecina to build a fleet. A fort on the Lippe called Castra Aliso was besieged, but the attackers dispersed on sight of Roman reinforcements. The Germans destroyed the nearby mound and altar dedicated to his father Drusus, but he had them both restored and celebrated funerary games with his legions {{in honor of his}} father. New barriers and earthworks <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> place, securing the area between Fort Aliso and the Rhine.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Singapore went through some post-independence crises, {{including}} the SARS outbreak in 2003 {{and the threat}} of terrorism. In December 2001, a plot to bomb embassies and other infrastructure in Singapore was uncovered and as many as 36 members of the Jemaah Islamiyah group were arrested under the Internal Security Act. Major counter-terrorism measures <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> place to detect and prevent potential terrorist acts and to minimise damages should they occur. More emphasis was placed on promoting social integration and trust between the different communities.|$|E
5|$|On 22 November 1939, plans <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> {{place for}} the {{restoration}} of passenger services to allow ambulance trains to reach the hospital, and authorisation was given for their operation. However, the line was never used to transport patients, as although Park House was used as a hospital by the Canadian Army during the Second World War, patients left ambulance trains at Hellingly station and were transferred to Park House by road.|$|E
5|$|On August 18 the {{hurricane}} watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning. Curfews <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> place for {{parts of the}} island, while off-duty essential personnel were called back to work.

5|$|Oxenfree was {{developed}} primarily using the Unity game engine, Adobe Photoshop, and Autodesk Maya. The game's artwork {{was made by}} Heather Gross. The game's camera distance from the player characters and 2D look {{were the result of}} functional necessity, as the team needed to show multiple characters, dialogue bubbles, and places to explore in the environment on the screen simultaneously. Working with these requirements, Gross created parallaxing, painterly backgrounds. The dark, organic elements of the setting <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> opposition to the supernatural elements, which are bright and geometric.|$|E
5|$|Reform was {{demanded by}} such voices as U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, who decried the {{brutality}} and foul {{play of the}} game, and called a meeting of school presidents to discuss the issue. As a result, before the next season began, new rules <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> place to discourage such play. The forward pass was also introduced {{to open up the}} game and reduce the role of dangerous mass formations. Despite the planned changes, a number of universities banned the sport for the coming year, including Columbia, NYU, and Northwestern.|$|E

5|$|The storm {{affected}} {{the town of}} Norfolk, where it became the most damaging storm since 1879.

Three other ships were driven ashore on Virginia beaches from Dam Rock to Cape Henry, and numerous others <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> danger.|$|E
5|$|The text of a New Kingdom Book of the Dead was {{typically}} written in cursive hieroglyphs, most often {{from left to}} right, but also sometimes from right to left.

Illustrations <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> frames above, below, or between the columns of text. The largest illustrations took up a full page of papyrus.|$|E
5|$|To {{help the}} Apalachicola Bay {{shellfish}} industry recover, special regulations <b>were</b> <b>put</b> <b>in</b> place to monitor harvests, and $2 million was designated toward rehabilitation efforts.

The state of Florida also issued a grant to help individuals in the crippled seafood industry make necessary payments. Efforts to help newly unemployed individuals in the shellfish industry continued in the months following the storm; local Tallahassee musicians organized a benefit concert in January 1986 to raise money for families of oystermen in Franklin County.|$|E
