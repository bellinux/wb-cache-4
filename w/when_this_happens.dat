5|$|A {{second year}} student and Mitsuomi's younger brother. Most {{of the time}} he has an easy going {{personality}} and is somewhat shy, but his demeanor changes when he becomes angered or serious. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> he becomes a very formidable combatant.|$|E
5|$|If {{the data}} is {{corrupted}} while transmitted or received, the CRC check fails. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> the receiver does not generate an ACK, which makes the sender resend the packet.|$|E
5|$|On {{very rare}} occasions, a {{combination}} of the weight distribution of the train, the force of the launch, and the wind can stall a train {{on the top of the}} tower. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> a mechanic takes the elevator to the top and pushes the train down the hill.|$|E
5000|$|<b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened,</b> King Wamba was in Cantabria campaigning {{against the}} Basques.|$|R
60|$|William {{abandoned}} {{himself to}} a laugh. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened</b> it was put in the Juanita's log.|$|R

5|$|Hassler Whitney {{showed that}} if the graph is 3-connected then the embedding, and thus the dual graph, is unique. By Steinitz's theorem, these graphs are exactly the {{polyhedral}} graphs, the graphs of convex polyhedra. A planar graph is 3-vertex-connected {{if and only if}} its dual graph is 3-vertex-connected. More generally, a planar graph has a unique embedding, and therefore also a unique dual, if and only if it is a subdivision of a 3-vertex-connected planar graph (a graph formed from a 3-vertex-connected planar graph by replacing some of its edges by paths). For some planar graphs that are not 3-vertex-connected, such as the complete bipartite graph , the embedding is not unique, but all embeddings are isomorphic. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> correspondingly, all dual graphs are isomorphic.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the regular enemies, the player also needs to defeat several bosses and mini-bosses throughout the game. By defeating enemies, the player gains experience points, which make the hero's level increase; <b>when</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> the player gets points to spend on four different disciplines, each of which gives the hero access to different abilities and enhances different stats associated with the discipline: Warrior is associated with physical attacks, Monk with defense and health points, Mage with magic attacks and magic points, and Sage {{with an increase in}} the weapon limit gauge. Sometimes when enemies are defeated, they drop items; the player can carry items with them, which are grouped into stacks, each taking up one slot in the inventory.|$|E
5|$|A back-building thunderstorm, {{commonly}} referred to as a training thunderstorm, is a thunderstorm in which new development takes place on the upwind side (usually the west or southwest side in the Northern Hemisphere), such that the storm seems to remain stationary or propagate in a backward direction. Though the storm often appears stationary on radar, or even moving upwind, this is an illusion. The storm is really a multi-cell storm with new, more vigorous cells that form on the upwind side, replacing older cells that continue to drift downwind. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> catastrophic flooding is possible. In Rapid City, South Dakota, in 1972, an unusual alignment of winds at various levels of the atmosphere combined to produce a continuously training set of cells that dropped an enormous quantity of rain upon the same area, resulting in devastating flash flooding. A similar event occurred in Boscastle, England, on 16 August 2004.|$|E
60|$|<b>WHEN</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened,</b> the Flopsy Bunnies {{went across}} the field to a rubbish heap, in the ditch outside Mr. McGregor's garden.|$|R
50|$|Neither Kerry nor Edwards {{were at the}} {{headquarters}} <b>when</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened.</b> Kerry was campaigning in Michigan at the time, while Edwards was fund-raising in Connecticut.|$|R
50|$|The cleft {{to produce}} {{two sides of}} the 'apple' was a natural occurrence. It is unknown <b>when</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened</b> and {{therefore}} the cleaving of the rock has attracted mythological explanations.|$|R
5|$|The {{most common}} initial {{course of the}} disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype, which is {{characterized}} by unpredictable attacks (relapses) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity. After some years, {{many of the people}} who have this subtype begin to experience neurologic decline without acute relapses. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens</b> it is called secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Other, less common, courses of the disease are the primary progressive (decline from the beginning without attacks) and the progressive-relapsing (steady neurologic decline and superimposed attacks). Different therapies are used for patients experiencing acute attacks, for patients who have the relapsing-remitting subtype, for patients who have the progressive subtypes, for patients without a diagnosis of MS who have a demyelinating event, and for managing the various consequences of MS.|$|E
25|$|Nervous Laugh: A laugh not {{matching}} the situation. This {{could be a}} sign of nervousness or discomfort. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> it may be good to probe with questions to discover the person's true feelings.|$|E
25|$|Some kantenji {{patterns}} {{can be used}} {{to write}} two or more common kanji, while reversing the elements would not signify any common characters. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> the reversed form {{can be used to}} signify that second kanji.|$|E
50|$|Old Meadowvale {{began when}} a Georgian manor {{was built by}} Charles Horace Gooderham. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened,</b> more people started to come. Now, many people live there from many {{different}} cultures.|$|R

50|$|In September 2006, {{governance}} for para-cycling {{passed from}} the International Paralympic Committee's International Cycling Committee to UCI {{at a meeting in}} Switzerland. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened,</b> the responsibility of classifying the sport also changed.|$|R
25|$|If the pouring {{temperature}} {{is too high}} or a sand {{of low melting point}} is used then the sand can fuse to the casting. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens</b> the surface of the casting produced has a brittle, glassy appearance.|$|E
25|$|Finally, a {{possible}} fate of negative muons bound to conventional atoms {{is that they}} are captured by the weak-force by protons in nuclei in a sort of electron-capture-like process. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> the proton becomes a neutron and a muon neutrino is emitted.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes a party {{making an}} application, {{or taking a}} step {{in terms of the}} Act, will omit {{prescribed}} details, or fail to act within the time stipulated, or commit some other procedural breach. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> it is important to establish whether what has been done is invalid by reason of the defect or irregularity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I {{watched the}} flowers; and the dingle-bells and cowslips and cockle-shells are all {{withered}} and faded away. And {{did you not}} say that, God willing, <b>when</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened</b> you {{would come back to}} us?" ...|$|R
50|$|Contestants do not {{necessarily}} cook in their own homes. In most cases <b>when</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened</b> it {{is the home of}} a family member or friend or a holiday home of one or both members of the team.|$|R
5000|$|The Two Faces Of Trouble: Vicki Renton buys an old Gemini pendant {{which has}} the faces of two smiling girls. But in some mysterious way, their {{expressions}} could change and <b>when</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened,</b> Vickiâ€™s behaviour changes too.|$|R
25|$|All PVC {{polymers}} are degraded by {{heat and}} light. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> hydrogen chloride is {{released into the}} atmosphere and oxidation of the compound occurs. Because hydrogen chloride readily combines with water vapor {{in the air to}} form hydrochloric acid, polyvinyl chloride is not recommended for long-term archival storage of silver, photographic film or paper (mylar is preferable).|$|E
25|$|Cramer's {{object is}} to {{showcase}} his encyclopedic knowledge of stocks and give callers a second opinion on their stock ideas. He takes as many calls as possible before a buzzer goes off to indicate {{the end of the}} round. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> Cramer gets upset and usually takes a few more calls. After this, the Daktronics buzzer goes off at his signal, and the segment is over.|$|E
25|$|Teams are {{prohibited}} from contacting friends, family, and acquaintances during the Race without supervision. The Race however may provide them {{with an opportunity to}} contact them at select times. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens</b> while the race is going on, teams are not allowed to proceed to their next task. In special circumstances the production team will allow racers to contact family members outside of a race-required task.|$|E
50|$|The Motheo District was disestablished on 18 May 2011. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened,</b> of {{its three}} {{constituent}} local municipalities, Mangaung was upgraded {{to become an}} autonomous metropolitan municipality, Naledi became part of Xhariep, and Mantsopa became part of Thabo Mofutsanyane.|$|R

50|$|Much later, in some circumstances, {{succession}} of chieftainship, headship of the clan, changed into primogeniture. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened,</b> Salic patrimony pattern usually meant strict use of so-called Salic Law succession, {{the one to}} preserve all agnates' rights over any females.|$|R
25|$|Every year hurricanes {{represent}} {{a potential threat}} to the islands of the Caribbean, due to the extremely destructive nature of these powerful weather systems. Coral reefs can easily be damaged by violent wave action, and can be destroyed when a hurricane dumps sand or mud onto a reef. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> the coral organisms are smothered and the reef dies and ultimately breaks apart.|$|E
25|$|After a first PE, {{the search}} for {{secondary}} causes is usually brief. Only when a second PE occurs, and especially <b>when</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens</b> while still under anticoagulant therapy, a further search for underlying conditions is undertaken. This will include testing ("thrombophilia screen") for Factor V Leiden mutation, antiphospholipid antibodies, protein C and S and antithrombin levels, and later prothrombin mutation, MTHFR mutation, Factor VIII concentration and rarer inherited coagulation abnormalities.|$|E
25|$|Priests and {{candidates}} for the priesthood often live at a level both materially and educationally superior to that of their families {{and the members of}} their own age group. It is therefore very easy for them to succumb to the temptation of thinking of themselves as better than others. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>happens,</b> the ideal of priestly service and self-giving dedication can fade, leaving the priest dissatisfied and disheartened.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{nothing to}} laugh at," [...] said Billie seriously [...] "It was a tragedy. I {{had always thought}} him romantic, and <b>when</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened</b> the scales seemed to fall from my eyes. I saw that I had made a mistake." ...|$|R
50|$|The Ming victory here {{cemented}} {{their position}} as the leading rebel group, {{and the one that}} would take command when the Yuan Dynasty fell. <b>When</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened</b> five years later, Zhu Yuanzhang became the first Emperor of the Ming Dynasty as Hongwu.|$|R
5000|$|The {{story begins}} as Skip (played by Kim Bodnia) is proudly telling a boy {{about the only}} surfer who rode a [...] "monstrous" [...] wave during a storm. When the boy asks <b>when</b> <b>this</b> <b>happened,</b> Skip answers that it was long, long ago....|$|R
