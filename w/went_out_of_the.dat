Borussia Dortmund eliminated Celtic {{in the first}} round of the UEFA Cup in 1987, while Werder Bremen eliminated Celtic from the European Cup at the second round stage in 1988. In September 1989, Celtic's new Polish striker Dariusz Dziekanowski scored four goals at Parkhead in the second leg of a first round European Cup Winners Cup encounter with Partizan Belgrade, but the team still <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> competition under the away goals rule.|$|E

5|$|The 2012–13 {{season was}} {{undoubtedly}} a low ebb {{for the club}} under Jeffrey's reign. The Blues were off the pace {{for most of the}} league campaign – their season encapsulated in a 3–1 home defeat by newly promoted Ballinamallard United in October 2012. Cliftonville were the eventual champions, securing their fourth league title after defeating Linfield 3–2 at Solitude on 13 April 2013. Crusaders secured the runners-up place, leaving the Blues in third place – a distant 29 points behind the champions. The club <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2013 Setanta Sports Cup after a heavy aggregate defeat in the quarter-finals, <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> League Cup at the semi-final stage, and exited the Irish Cup in the fifth round after a replay. The club's first Irish Cup defeat in four years was also the first time in 16 years they had lost their opening tie of the competition.|$|E
5|$|O'Sullivan <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Malta Cup with a 3–5 loss to Michael Holt in {{the first}} round. He reached the quarter-finals of the Welsh Open, but lost 4–5 against Neil Robertson. In his quarter-final match against Joe Swail at the Irish Masters, O'Sullivan {{compiled}} a maximum break {{on his way to}} a narrow 5–4 victory, the second 147 in any professional competition in Ireland. The initial maximum break prize of a Citroën Coupe, worth €20,000, was later withdrawn by the organisers. He then defeated John Higgins 6–5 in the semi-finals, and won the title by defeating Barry Hawkins 9–1 in the final. O'Sullivan then reached the semi-finals of the China Open, but lost 2–6 against eventual champion Graeme Dott. Just before the World Championship, in which he was to play a first-round match with Ding Junhui again, O'Sullivan claimed that the draw was fixed. This was subsequently denied by World Snooker, and O'Sullivan later retracted his accusation. In the end, O'Sullivan won the tie easily by 10 frames to 2. He also won his second-round match against Robertson 13–10 (despite losing six frames in a row at one point), before losing his quarter-final match 9–13 against eventual champion John Higgins.|$|E
5|$|On 4 June 2010, Drogba {{was injured}} in a {{friendly}} match with Japan. He received the injury in a high challenge from defender Túlio Tanaka. He fractured the ulna in his right arm and had an operation {{the next day in}} the hope of making the finals. On 15 June 2010, Drogba was cleared by FIFA to play in the Ivory Coast's first group game against Portugal wearing a protective cast on his broken arm. The match ended in a goalless draw at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium with Drogba coming on in the 65th minute. On 20 June 2010, Drogba became the first player from an African nation to score against Brazil in a World Cup match, scoring with a header in the 78th minute as the Ivory Coast were defeated 1–3. On 25 June 2010, the Ivory Coast <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> competition despite winning 3–0 against North Korea in their final match.|$|E

5|$|O'Sullivan {{withdrew from}} the first ranking event of the season, the Shanghai Masters, citing back {{problems}} for which doctors had advised him not to travel. He also chose not to enter the invitational Pot Black tournament. He made {{the final of the}} Grand Prix, but lost 6–9 against Marco Fu. During the Northern Ireland Trophy, he set a new record by compiling five centuries in a 5–2 win over Ali Carter. This also included his seventh official competitive 147 maximum break. O'Sullivan <b>went</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tournament in the next round, having lost against Fergal O'Brien. On 2 December 2007, he won a fourth consecutive, and record seventh total, Premier League Snooker title, by beating John Higgins in the final by a score of 7–4. On 15 December 2007, O'Sullivan compiled his eighth maximum break in competition, in the deciding frame of his UK Championship semi–final against Mark Selby at Telford, equalling Hendry's record. In doing so, he also became only the third person in professional competition to compile a maximum to win a match. Hendry had made the first against O'Sullivan in the 1997 Charity Challenge final, and Mark Williams had made the second, at the Crucible {{in the first round of}} the 2005 World Championship. O'Sullivan is also the second player after John Higgins to make breaks of 147 in two consecutive ranking tournaments (2007 Northern Ireland Trophy and 2007 Maplin UK Championship). He then went on to win the tournament, beating Stephen Maguire 10–2 in the final (from 8–0 up), thereby receiving a £100,000 cheque for winning his first ranking tournament in almost three years.|$|E
