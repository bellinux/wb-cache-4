25|$|The {{championship}} game was a rematch against France, a team the USA {{had played in}} the preliminary round, winning by just six points. France scored first, {{and a few minutes}} into the game, the score was tied at six points each. However, the USA then went on an 11–2 run to open up a double-digit lead. The game was roughly even from then {{until the end of the}} half, with France cutting into the lead slightly. The USA led at halftime 27–20. Earlier in the day, Spain held a 14-point halftime lead over Australia in the Bronze medal game, but could not hold on to the lead, so no one <b>was</b> <b>thinking</b> <b>that</b> a seven-point lead was safe. The second half was all USA. The USA started on a 10–0 run, and would end up surrendering only eight points in the second half. France ended up shooting under 22% from the field, and the USA would go on to win the game and the gold medal by a score of 61–28. Stewart was the high scorer for the team with 16 points, and also set a U19 all-time record for scoring with 152 points, which put her ahead of Maya Moore, who scored 147 in 2007. Alexis Jones had 29 assist during the tournament, tying an all-time U18 record established by Ariel Massengale. Stewart was named the MVP of the tournament and named to the all-tournament team.|$|E
