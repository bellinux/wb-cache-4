5|$|The {{distribution}} of jungle cat is largely oriental; {{it occurs in}} the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent, central and southeastern Asia, Sri Lanka and in southern China. It {{is the most common}} small <b>wild</b> <b>cat</b> in India. Thought to be absent from south of the Isthmus of Kra in the Malayan peninsula, the possibility of its occurrence was reported from a highly fragmented forest in the Malaysian state of Selangor in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Grave {{artifacts}} from dirt domes excavated in the 1980s along the Illinois River revealed a complete {{skeleton of a}} young bobcat along with a collar made of bone pendants and shell beads that had been buried by the Hopewell culture. The type and place of burial indicate a tamed and cherished pet or possible spiritual significance. The Hopewell normally buried their dogs, so the bones were initially identified as remains of a puppy, but dogs were usually buried close to the village {{and not in the}} mounts themselves. This is the only <b>wild</b> <b>cat</b> decorated burial on the archaeological record.|$|E

50|$|Many {{different}} species of mammal can be classified as cats (felids) in the United States. These include domestic cat (both house cats and feral), of the species Felis catus; medium-sized <b>wild</b> <b>cats</b> from the genus Lynx; and big cats from the genera Puma and Panthera. Domestic <b>cats</b> vastly outnumber <b>wild</b> <b>cats</b> in the United States.|$|R
5|$|Mountain hare (apparently {{absent from}} Skye in the 18th century) and rabbit are now {{abundant}} and predated on by <b>wild</b> <b>cat</b> and pine marten. Red deer are common {{on the hills}} and the grey seal and common seal are present around the coasts of Scotland in internationally important numbers, with colonies of the former found on Oronsay and the Treshnish Isles and the latter most abundant in the Firth of Lorn. The rich fresh water streams contain brown trout, Atlantic salmon and water shrew. Offshore minke whales, killer whales, basking sharks, porpoises and dolphins are among the sea life {{that can be seen}} and edible crab and oyster are also found, in for example, the Sound of Scalpay. There are nationally important horse mussel and brittlestar beds in the sea lochs.|$|E
5|$|During the War of 1812, {{in which}} U.S. forces battled the British Empire and its Indian allies, Taylor {{successfully}} defended Fort Harrison in Indiana Territory from an Indian attack commanded by Tecumseh. The September 1812 battle represented the first land {{victory of the}} war for the American forces, and Taylor's leadership received wide praise. He received a brevet (temporary) promotion {{to the rank of}} major; according to Eisenhower, this represented the first brevet ever awarded in United States history. Later that year, Taylor joined General Samuel Hopkins as an aide on two expeditions: the first into the Illinois Territory and the second to the Tippecanoe battle site, where they were forced to retreat in the Battle of <b>Wild</b> <b>Cat</b> Creek. Taylor moved his growing family to Fort Knox after the violence subsided. In spring 1814, he was called back into action under Brigadier General Benjamin Howard. After Howard fell sick, Taylor led a 430-man expedition from St. Louis, Missouri up the Mississippi River. In the Battle of Credit Island, Taylor defeated Indian forces, but retreated after the Indians were joined by their British allies. That October he supervised the construction of Fort Johnson near present-day Warsaw, Illinois, the last toehold of the U.S. Army in the upper Mississippi River Valley. Upon Howard's death a few weeks later, Taylor was ordered to abandon the fort and retreat to St. Louis. Reduced to the rank of captain when the war ended in 1815, he resigned from the army. He re-entered it a year later after gaining a commission as a major.|$|E

The <b>Wild</b> <b>Cat</b> Aqueduct carries water from the Cobble Mountain Reservoir to a hydroelectric generating station on the Granville-Russel border, at the Little River.

25|$|Many {{apartment}} complexes and rental homes institute no pet policies. No pet policies are a {{leading cause of}} animal abandonment, which is considered a crime in many jurisdictions. In many cases, abandoned pets have to be euthanized due to the strain they put on animal shelters and rescue groups. Abandoned animals often become feral or contribute to feral populations. In particular, feral dogs can pose a serious threat to pets, children, and livestock. Feral cats are known to hunt endangered birds and have interbred with <b>wild</b> <b>cat</b> populations.|$|E
