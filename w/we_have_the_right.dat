Have pity on people and cease to destroy them: we did not give life to anyone nor do <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to take it away from others: but because you shall not send your soldiers to a certain death, since we are not to surrender the fortress without a fierce and bitter resistance.|$|E

[...] "In teaching us a new visual code, photographs alter and enlarge our notion of what is worth looking at and what <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to observe" [...] and has changed our [...] "viewing ethics". Photographs have increased our access to knowledge and experiences of history and faraway places, but the images may replace direct experience and limit reality. She also states that photography desensitizes its audience to horrific human experiences, and children are exposed to experiences before they are ready for them.|$|E

Eli Lilly pleaded guilty to actively promoting Zyprexa for off-label uses, particularly {{for the treatment of}} dementia in the elderly. The $1.415 billion penalty included an $800 million civil settlement and a $515 million criminal fine. The U.S. Justice Department said the criminal fine of $515 million was the largest ever in a health care case, and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a U.S. criminal prosecution of any kind. [...] "That was a blemish for us," [...] John C. Lechleiter, CEO of Lilly, told The New York Times. [...] "We don’t ever want that to happen again.

2500|$|On 13 May Powell {{said the}} task force was sent [...] "to repossess the Falkland Islands, to restore British {{administration}} of the islands {{and to ensure that}} the decisive factor in the future of the islands should be the wishes of the inhabitants" [...] but the Foreign Secretary (Francis Pym) desired an [...] "interim agreement": [...] "So far as I understand that interim agreement, it is in breach, if not in contradiction, of each of the three objects with which {{the task force}} was dispatched to the South Atlantic. There was to be a complete and supervised withdrawal of Argentine forces... matched by corresponding withdrawal of British forces. There is no withdrawal of British force that 'corresponds' to the withdrawal from the territory of the islands of those who have unlawfully occupied them. We {{have a right to be}} there; those are our waters, the territory is ours and <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> to sail the oceans with our fleets whenever we think fit. So the whole notion of a 'corresponding withdrawal', a withdrawal of the only force which can possibly restore the position, which can possibly ensure any of the objectives which have been talked about on either side of the House, is in contradiction of the determination to repossess the Falklands".|$|E

2500|$|The game is {{the first}} Harmonix game to feature a full album in the game as shipped, with the {{entirety}} of American Idiot, Dookie (except for hidden track [...] "All By Myself"), and 21st Century Breakdown being playable. The inclusion of the full album of American Idiot was {{the centerpiece of the}} game's development, according to Harmonix' Chris Foster, {{due in part to the}} thematic nature of the album which is meant to be listened as a whole, as well as the album's success and Broadway musical. This led the team to also including 21st Century Breakdown, an album similar to American Idiot that is meant to be heard as one complete work; as Harmonix had already released six songs from the album as downloadable content, they did not want to make those that had purchased the songs have to pay for them again in the full game, and instead designed the game to immediately incorporate those songs into the game if the player had already purchased them. Once these two albums were selected, Harmonix' CEO Alex Rigopulos determined that they needed to include the full Dookie album, the major label debut of the band and one of the most requested albums by Rock Band fans, in order to complete the experience. Though Harmonix had considered including material from the earliest Green Day albums, 1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours and Kerplunk, master multi-track recordings [...] required by the Rock Band game engine to provide proper feedback when playing were not readily available,. According to Cool, while the master tapes for Kerplunk exist, they are in poor shape and the process to digitize them would destroy the tape; as such, Cool stated [...] "We’re making sure <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> dudes to do it" [...] as potential future downloadable content for the game. Harmonix opted against using live versions of songs on these albums, feeling that the game needed to stay with the studio versions of the songs. Once Harmonix had selected to focus on the three albums, they decided against including any additional non-Green Day songs, instead focusing on rounding out the group's history to present a complete Green Day experience.|$|E
