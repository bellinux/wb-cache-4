Chapman then scored the winning goal in the 2–1 FA Women's Cup final victory over Doncaster Belles, a volley from 20yards. In Conclusion to the 2001-02 season, Chapman went on to be awarded the Ladies Player of the Season, as well as, winning the Nationwide International Player of the Year award.|$|E

He <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be {{selected}} as an instructor and took his first pupil after having flown only nine hours of solo flight himself. Two of his pupils included the future ace and 56 Squadron colleague Geoffrey Hilton Bowman and Mick Mannock. Soon afterwards, while teaching {{a student in the}} Airco DH.1 in which they were flying, the aircraft entered a dangerous spin. McCudden narrowly avoided a crash, pulling up feet above the ground.

He played for the Rita Social Club after moving to Fitzroy, while his wife kept score. His daughter was also a scorer for the club. As recreational facilities and grass ovals were sparse in densely populated Fitzroy, the boys took to playing cricket in a cobblestone laneway between their terraced house.

5|$|During the {{preliminary}} round at the World Championships, Sacramone {{qualified for the}} event finals on floor and vault {{and contributed to the}} top-qualifying position of the American team. She also posted a score on beam that would have been high enough to qualify her to the beam final. However, due to an International Federation of Gymnastics rule allowing only two athletes per country to participate in each event final, Sacramone was unable to compete for a beam medal, because teammates Liukin and Shawn Johnson qualified ahead of her. In the team final, she competed on vault, beam and floor, earning scores of 15.750, 15.600 and 15.325, respectively. When the American team faltered after a difficult beam rotation, in which two gymnasts made major errors, Sacramone gathered the team for a pep talk to refocus them for floor. The American team earned 184.400 points overall, which <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> secure the gold medal ahead of China and Romania.|$|E

After winning the {{following}} game against, the Hoyas lost to Ohio State by one point in their {{final game of the}} tournament. Georgetown then began a thirteen-game win streak, which was followed by losing three straight to three conference opponents. The Hoyas then finished the regular season with nine more wins and one loss, which <b>was</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> finish second in the Big East regular season standings. The Hoyas won their first two games of the Big East Tournament by a collective margin of 29 points and advanced to the championship game against the Villanova Wildcats. The two teams were tied at halftime, but at halftime the Hoyas elected to use a man to man defense over a zone. This proved effective as they were able to force turnovers and shoot well from the field, which led them to win the game 7254. The Georgetown Hoyas won the Big East Tournament and also, a bid to the NCAA Tournament.|$|E
