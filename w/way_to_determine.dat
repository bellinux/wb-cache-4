5|$|To {{support its}} {{assertion}} that the Sultan of Johor did not have sovereignty over Pedra Branca, Singapore contended that the traditional Malay concept of sovereignty was based mainly on control over people and not over territory. Thus, the only reliable <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether a particular territory belonged to a ruler was {{to find out whether}} the inhabitants pledged allegiance to that ruler. This was difficult to do with respect to Pedra Branca since it was isolated and uninhabited, and Malaysia had not provided clear evidence of a direct claim to or actual exercise of sovereign authority over the island.|$|E
5|$|Fitzgerald had {{no system}} {{to monitor the}} {{presence}} or amount of water in her cargo hold, {{even though there was}} always some present. The intensity of the November 10 storm would have made it difficult, if not impossible, to access the hatches from the spar deck. The USCG Marine Board found that flooding of the hold could not have been assessed until the water {{reached the top of the}} taconite cargo. The NTSB investigation concluded that it would have been impossible to pump water from the hold when it was filled with bulk cargo. The Marine Board noted that because Fitzgerald lacked a draft-reading system, the crew had no <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether the vessel had lost freeboard (the level of a ship's deck above the water).|$|E
5|$|Lord Stanley, {{who often}} {{attended}} Ottawa HC games, felt {{the loss of}} the title after holding it all season was an unsuitable <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the championship. In the letter announcing the Stanley Cup, Stanley suggested that the AHAC start a 'round-robin' type regular season format, which the AHAC implemented in the following season of 1892–93. The key match-up in that season for Ottawa was a loss in the opening game of the season against the Montreal Victorias on January 7, 1893, as Ottawa split its season series with eventual winner Montreal HC, both teams otherwise winning all of their games. This loss provided the one game margin in the standings that led to Lord Stanley awarding the initial Cup to Montreal HC.|$|E

5|$|The {{race between}} Amondson and Dodge {{was viewed as}} a <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> which faction would lead the party in the future. Amondson {{achieved}} ballot access in Louisiana as the nominee of the Prohibition Party and in Colorado as the nominee of the Concerns of People Party. Dodge achieved ballot access only in Colorado, where he was listed as the nominee of the Prohibition Party. Overall, Amondson won the contest, collecting 1,896 (1,512 of those were from Louisiana) votes compared to Dodge's 140. As expected, Amondson placed well behind both major candidates (George W. Bush received 1.1million votes, and John Kerry received over 1million votes). He placed eighth in a slate of 12 candidates on Colorado's ballot (Dodge placed last, even though it was his home state). Amondson's third-place finish in four Louisiana parishes was the first time since 1960 that the Prohibition Party nominee for President out polled-all other third party candidates for president in any county.|$|E
