With that the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) pays tribute to the fact that, after <b>the</b> process <b>has</b> been defined, higher process maturity, and with that higher product maturity, can only be achieved by improving and optimizing the life-cycle process itself. In <b>the</b> last three years, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to observe more than 50 software development teams in planning, specifying and building library related, real-world applications.

This paper summarizes <b>the</b> lessons <b>we</b> <b>have</b> learned in our ongoing endeavor to integrate the WinWin lifecycle process. In doing so, we will not only describe what techniques <b>have</b> proven to be useful in getting the developer’s task done but the reader will also get some insight on how to tackle process improvement itself. As more and more companies are reaching CMM levels two or higher this task, of managing and optimizing the process, becomes increasingly important...|$|R
