Mommsen and I share in a great many things, and in many respects we share in a common past; but in so far as we are different people and representatives of different cultures and different generations <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>different</b> pasts. ... ur views of Julius Caesar must differ, slightly perhaps, but perceptibly.

It is the same with us Manchus (Jušen) and Mongols. Our languages are different, but our clothing and way of life is the same." [...] Later Nurhaci indicated that the bond with the Mongols was not based in any real shared culture. It was for pragmatic reasons of [...] "mutual opportunism", since Nurhaci said to the Mongols: [...] "You Mongols raise livestock, eat meat and wear pelts.
