25|$|The western {{lowland gorilla}} (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) {{is one of}} two {{subspecies}} of the <b>western</b> <b>gorilla</b> (Gorilla gorilla) that lives in montane, primary and secondary forests and lowland swamps in central Africa in Angola, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon. It is the nominate subspecies of the <b>western</b> <b>gorilla.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{eastern gorilla}} is more darkly {{coloured}} than the <b>western</b> <b>gorilla,</b> with the mountain gorilla being the darkest of all. The mountain gorilla {{also has the}} thickest hair. The western lowland gorilla can be brown or grayish with a reddish forehead. In addition, gorillas that live in lowland forests are more slender and agile than the more bulky mountain gorillas. The eastern gorilla also has a longer face and broader chest than the <b>western</b> <b>gorilla.</b>|$|E
25|$|The American {{physician}} and missionary Thomas Staughton Savage and naturalist Jeffries Wyman first described the <b>western</b> <b>gorilla</b> (they called it Troglodytes gorilla) in 1847 from specimens obtained in Liberia. The name was derived , described by Hanno.|$|E
50|$|When {{comparing}} the Cross River <b>gorilla</b> to <b>western</b> <b>gorillas,</b> they have noticeably smaller palates, smaller cranial vaults, and shorter skulls. The Cross River gorilla {{is not known}} to differ much in terms of body size or limb and bone length from <b>western</b> <b>gorillas.</b> However, measurements taken from a male suggest that they have shorter hands and feet and have a larger opposability index than <b>western</b> <b>gorillas.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Western</b> <b>gorillas</b> are {{generally}} lighter colored than eastern <b>gorillas.</b> <b>Western</b> lowland <b>gorillas</b> have black, dark grey or dark brown-grey fur with a brownish forehead. Measurements of wild individuals show that mature males average 155 cm in height, while mature females average 135 cm, weights of wild individuals have been rarely taken but captive <b>western</b> <b>gorillas</b> average 157 kg in males and 80 kg in females. The Cross River gorilla {{differs from the}} <b>western</b> lowland <b>gorilla</b> in both skull and tooth dimensions.|$|R

25|$|A gorilla's {{lifespan}} {{is normally}} between 35 and 40 years, although zoo gorillas may live for 50 years or more. Colo, a female <b>western</b> <b>gorilla</b> at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium {{was the oldest}} known gorilla, at 60 years of age when she died on January 17, 2017.|$|E
25|$|The park is home {{to about}} 78% of the primate species that are found in Nigeria, {{including}} the vulnerable common chimpanzee and <b>western</b> <b>gorilla,</b> and the endangered Sclater's guenon, Preuss's monkey and drill, which coexist in the same areas of the park. Other large mammals include the endangered African forest elephant and more common African buffalo.|$|E
25|$|American {{physician}} and missionary Thomas Staughton Savage obtained the first specimens (the skull and other bones) {{during his time}} in Liberia. The first scientific description of gorillas dates back to an article by Savage and the naturalist Jeffries Wyman in 1847 in Proceedings of the Boston Society of Natural History, where Troglodytes gorilla is described, {{now known as the}} <b>western</b> <b>gorilla.</b> Other species of gorilla were described in the next few years.|$|E
25|$|Zoos {{worldwide}} have {{a population}} of 550 <b>western</b> lowland <b>gorillas,</b> and the Cincinnati Zoo leads the United States in <b>western</b> lowland <b>gorilla</b> births.|$|R
5000|$|The eponymous genus Gorilla {{is divided}} into two species: the eastern <b>gorillas</b> and the <b>western</b> <b>gorillas</b> (both {{critically}} endangered), and either four or five subspecies.|$|R
25|$|Disease {{has also}} been a factor in the {{survival}} of the <b>western</b> lowland <b>gorilla.</b> The Ebola epizootic in western and central Africa has caused more than 90% mortality rate in <b>western</b> lowland <b>gorillas.</b> From 2003â€“2004, two epizootics infected the <b>western</b> lowland <b>gorilla,</b> which caused two thirds of their population to disappear. The outbreak was monitored in the Republic of Congo by Magdalena Bermejo and other field-based primatologists, as it also spread to humans through contact with bushmeat. The catastrophe led the World Conservation Union to designate the <b>western</b> lowland <b>gorilla</b> a critically endangered species. Malaria is also an issue that has been arising for the <b>western</b> lowland <b>gorillas.</b> Out of 51 faecal samples from habituated individuals, 25 were shown to have Plasmodium DNA. Laverania, which is a sub-genus of the Plasmodium genus of parasitic protozoa, was found in these studies. Varying exposure to different Anopheles mosquitoes transmitting Plasmodium species is known to be the origin of malaria in <b>western</b> lowland <b>gorillas.</b>|$|R
25|$|Biologists {{classify}} humans, {{along with}} only a few other species, as great apes (species in the family Hominidae). The living Hominidae include two distinct species of chimpanzee (the bonobo, Pan paniscus, and the common chimpanzee, Pan troglodytes), two species of gorilla (the <b>western</b> <b>gorilla,</b> Gorilla gorilla, and the eastern gorilla, Gorilla graueri), and two species of orangutan (the Bornean orangutan, Pongo pygmaeus, and the Sumatran orangutan, Pongo abelii). The great apes with the family Hylobatidae of gibbons form the superfamily Hominoidea of apes.|$|E
2500|$|Gorillas have a patchy distribution. The {{range of}} the two species is {{separated}} by the Congo River and its tributaries. The <b>western</b> <b>gorilla</b> lives in west central Africa, while the eastern gorilla lives in east central Africa. Between the species, and even within the species, gorillas live {{in a variety of}} habitats and elevations. Gorilla habitat ranges from montane forests to swamps. Eastern gorillas inhabit montane and submontane forests between [...] above sea level. Mountain gorillas live in the montane forests at the higher ends of the elevation range, while eastern lowland gorillas live in submontane forests at the lower ends of the elevation range. In addition, eastern lowland gorillas live in montane bamboo forests, as well as lowland forests ranging from [...] in elevation. Western gorillas live in both lowland swamp forests and montane forests, and elevations ranging from sea level to [...] Western lowland gorillas live in swamp and lowland forests ranging up to , and Cross River gorillas live in low-lying and submontane forests ranging from [...]|$|E

40|$|Taxonomic {{system is}} {{currently}} open and evolves based on new findings in genetics. There are currently two recognized species of gorillas (Gorilla gorilla and Gorilla beringei). Each {{of these two}} species consists of two subspecies. Gorilla gorilla gorilla is on the Red List of Threatened Species (IUCN) classified as Critically Endangered. The main threats to the population of this subspecies are poaching and Ebola. Gorillas are long-lived, slowly reproducing primates with significant sexual dimorphism. Gorilla diet is predominantly folivoric. <b>Western</b> <b>gorillas</b> include in their diet fruits, if available. The social system is polygynous with one dominant male who mates with all the females in his group. Eastern gorillas usually form larger social groups than <b>western</b> <b>gorillas.</b> Differences in reproduction between these species are minimal. Generally, the reproduction of <b>western</b> <b>gorillas</b> is slower. Eastern <b>gorilla</b> infants, unlike <b>western</b> <b>gorillas,</b> face {{a high risk of}} infanticide. Wild <b>western</b> lowland <b>gorillas</b> were almost not observed, so there is very little known about the course of reproduction in the wild. Almost all knowledge about their reproduction is based on observings in captivity. Reproduction of gorillas is influenced by many factors, among which are hormonal effects, the composition of the group and its hierarchy, nutrition and more. Historically <b>western</b> lowlan <b>gorillas</b> kept in captivity faced low birth rate. Available data on pregnancy in gorillas are insufficient. Further research is needed. The level of maternal care {{is one of the key}} factors crucial for the survival of infants. Maternal behavior is influenced by stress, which may result in inappropriate maternal behavior or possibly its complete absence. Diseases threatening pregnant gorillas are not adequately described. Among the main causes of complications described are inadequate nutrition and stress...|$|R
25|$|In {{the northeastern}} {{part of the}} Republic of the Congo, even though {{poaching}} is illegal, <b>western</b> lowland <b>gorillas</b> are still being hunted for their bushmeat and the young for pets; {{five percent of the}} species is killed each year because of this. Deforestation of this area allows for the trade of bushmeat and even more poaching. Commercial poaching of chimpanzees, forest elephants and <b>western</b> <b>gorillas</b> in The Republic of the Congo resulted from the increased amount of commercial logging and infrastructure. Deforestation and logging allowed for the creation of roads which allowed hunters to hunt deeper into the forests, increasing the amount of poaching and bushmeat trade in the area. The Republic of the Congo has put in place a conservation effort to conserve different species such as chimpanzees, forest elephants and <b>western</b> <b>gorillas</b> from poaching and deforestation. This conservation effort would allow these species to benefit from vegetation and ecologically important resources.|$|R
