She recovered, but was seriously ill again in March. By July, Anne had lost confidence in Harley; his secretary recorded that Anne told the cabinet [...] "that he neglected all business; that he was seldom to be understood; that when he did explain himself, she could not depend upon {{the truth of what}} he said; that he never came to her at the time she appointed; that he often came drunk; [...] last, to crown all, he behaved himself towards her with ill manner, indecency and disrespect." [...] On 27 July 1714, during Parliament's summer recess, she dismissed Harley as Lord Treasurer. Despite failing health, which her doctors blamed on the emotional strain of matters of state, she attended two late-night cabinet meetings that failed to determine Harley's successor. A third meeting was cancelled when she became too ill to attend. She was rendered unable to speak by a stroke on 30 July 1714, the anniversary of Gloucester's death, and on the advice of the Privy Council handed the treasurer's staff of office to Whig grandee Charles Talbot, 1st Duke of Shrewsbury. She died around 7:30a.m. on 1 August 1714. John Arbuthnot, one of her doctors, thought her death was a release from a life of ill-health and tragedy; he wrote to Jonathan Swift, [...] "I believe sleep was never more <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> weary traveller than death was to her." ...|$|E
