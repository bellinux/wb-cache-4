Mahendran said, [...] "If anybody tries to remake this black-and-white film, {{they will make}} a mockery of it." [...] According to Balachander, [...] "Just like Sivaji today, people talked about Chandralekha in the past. Produced {{at a cost of}} 30 lakhs ( [...] , a huge sum at that time), it has grand sets. I have seen it 12 times." [...] In December 2008, Muthiah said: [...] "Given how spectacular it wasand the appreciation lavished on it from 1948 till well into the 1950s, which is <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> up with itI'm sure that if re-released, it would do better at the box office than most Tamil films today." [...] In a 2011 interview with Indo-Asian News Service (IANS), South Indian Bollywood actor Vyjayanthimala said that although people consider that she [...] "paved the way" [...] for other South Indian female actors in Hindi cinema, [...] "the person who really opened the doors was S. S. Vasan ... When [...] released, it took the North by storm because by then they haven't seen that kind of lavish sets, costumes and splendour. So Vasan was the person who opened the door for Hindi films in the South." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Suddenly, I {{heard the}} clatter of Leycester's machine gun above {{the roar of the}} engine. I looked round to see what he was {{shooting}} at, and nearly had a heart attack. Slanting down from above, getting nicely into position thirty yards behind my tail, was an Albatros. [...] "I immediately heaved the old A-W round in a split-arse turn, tighter I think than I had ever turned before. I felt a flash of panic as I lost sight of the Hun, but Leycester must have been able to see him all right as he kept on firing. My sudden turn had done the trick. The Albatros overshot and suddenly appeared right in front of me. Because of the relative motion of our two aircraft, he seemed to hang motionless, suspended in mid-air. I could see the pilot's face as he looked back at me. I sent a two-second burst of Vickers (machine gun) fire into him. His aircraft seemed to flutter, then slid out of sight below my starboard wing. I was pretty certain that I had hit his petrol tank. Behind me, Leycester was still blazing away. He was using tracer (incendiary bullets), and it may have been one of his bullets that ignited the petrol pouring from the Hun's ruptured tank. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> sight of the Albatros again, it was burning like a torch and side-slipping towards the ground, trailing a streamer of smoke. For an instant I saw the German pilot, looking down {{over the side of the}} cockpit. Then the smoke and flames enveloped him." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The accused looked {{pale and}} worried <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>caught</b> {{sight of him}} in the court that day, which was not to be {{wondered}} at, considering the terrible position in which he found himself.|$|R

As for me, I don't often {{give them a}} chance, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> get <b>caught</b> <b>I</b> talk science and dead {{languages}} till they run for their lives.

6000|$|... "Just like, I should fancy, {{and very}} depressing. I {{began to wonder}} what on earth I should do, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> sight of the play-bill. What {{do you think the}} play was, Harry?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's {{wonderful}} how the Emperor's like {{a cousin}} of mine in the face," [...] said the grandmother; [...] "it struck me like lightning <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> sight of him. I couldn't have thought it." ...|$|E

And my colleague Ahmed Ali was injured on both legs... I think it was not right, the way they portrayed both {{the individual and the}} action. It was not right.|$|R
60|$|Standing {{against the}} funnel, {{apparently}} {{with the intention}} of drying himself by the heat as fast as he got wet, was a shabby man in threadbare black, and with his hands in his pockets, who fascinated me from the memorable instant <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> his eye.|$|E
60|$|We had {{not moved}} four steps <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> a sound as of {{footsteps}} upon gravel. My heart flew to my throat. We {{must not be}} seen coming from that house. I plucked at the king's robe and we drew back and took shelter behind {{the corner of the}} cabin.|$|E
6000|$|... "Aren't {{we going}} to wait----?" [...] I started to say to Bingo, {{thinking}} it somewhat thick that, in addition to asking a girl to lunch {{with him in a}} place like this, he should fling himself on the foodstuffs before she turned up, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> sight of his face, and stopped.|$|E
60|$|The {{appearance}} of the three, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first <b>caught</b> a near view of them, was such as almost to terrify me. Even Neb, whose face was usually as shining as a black bottle, was almost of the colour of ashes. The poor fellow could not speak, and, though Lucy was actually shaking him to extract an explanation, the only answer she could get was tears. These flowed from Neb's eyes in streams, and at length the fellow threw himself on the ground, and fairly began to groan.|$|R
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> first <b>caught</b> {{sight of}} them they were {{standing}} rather behind it, {{as if they were}} not anxious to be seen, but as we came nearer they emerged from its shadow and walked forward to meet us. The Emperor glanced back at me, and slackened his pace a little so that I came within arm's length of him. You may think that I had my hilt well to the front, and that I had a very good look at these two people who were approaching us.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, my dear!" [...] cried Mrs. Chandos, {{interrupting}} Honora's apologies, [...] "I'm sure I shan't sleep a wink--she gave {{me such a}} fright. You {{might have}} sent Trixy ahead to prepare us. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> first <b>caught</b> sight of her, I thought it was my own dear mother who had {{come all the way}} from Cleveland, and the cigarette burned my fingers. But I must say I think it was awfully clever of you to get hold of her and save Trixy's reputation. Good night, dear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will soon}} grow again," [...] George said, smiling. [...] "The doctor says our faces {{will be all}} right when the skin is peeled off. Thank you very much, Miss Penrose, for all the nice things. It was a {{fortunate}} day indeed for us <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> that boy stealing your locket." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hadn't the nerve. You {{always seemed}} so--I don't {{know how to}} put it--I always seemed such a worm. I was just trying to get the courage to propose <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> the mumps, and that seemed to me to finish it. No girl could love a man with three times the proper amount of face." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was not in}} the dark. I put out {{my light}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>caught</b> sight of you, knowing that {{otherwise}} you would run away, and fate stood me in good stead. You came on, as I willed that you should do. Now let us talk. Miss Clifford, have you changed your mind? You know the time is up." ...|$|E
2500|$|He was not {{a strict}} vegetarian, though he said he {{preferred}} that diet and advocated it {{as a means of}} self-improvement. He wrote in Walden, [...] "The practical objection to animal food in my case was its uncleanness; and besides, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>caught</b> and cleaned and cooked and eaten my fish, they seemed not to have fed me essentially. It was insignificant and unnecessary, and cost more than it came to. A little bread or a few potatoes would have done as well, with less trouble and filth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{saved my}} life <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was <b>caught</b> in the net, now I can repay you. Trust me with the flask, for I know all {{the ways of the}} Gloomy Cavern, and can fill it from the Fountain of Beauty." [...] Charming was only too glad to give her the flask, and she flitted into the cavern quite unnoticed by the dragon, and after some time {{returned}} with the flask, filled to the very brim with sparkling water. Charming thanked her with all his heart, and joyfully hastened back to the town.|$|R
60|$|Times were hard. Work of {{any sort}} was {{difficult}} to get. And work {{of any sort}} was what I had to take, for I was still an unskilled labourer. I had no thought of career. That was over and done with. I had to find food for two mouths beside my own and keep a roof over our heads--yes, and buy a winter suit, my one suit being decidedly summery. I had to {{get some sort of}} work immediately. After that, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> had <b>caught</b> my breath, <b>I</b> might think about my future.|$|R
