5|$|Neville {{once again}} {{attempts}} to administer a potential cure to the infected <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> laboratory, {{but the next}} night, a group of Darkseekers, who had followed Anna and Neville back the night before, attacks the house. Neville, Anna, and Ethan retreat into the basement laboratory, sealing themselves in with the female Darkseeker on which Neville has been experimenting. Discovering that the last treatment was successful, Neville tries to assess the situation as the alpha male deliberately rams himself against a glass door to break in. Neville draws a vial of blood from the woman he cured and gives it to Anna, before shutting her and Ethan inside a coal chute {{in the back of}} the lab. He then takes a grenade and kills the Darkseekers at the cost of his own life, saving the cure. The next day, before dusk, Anna and Ethan discover that her theory is right as they arrive at the survivors camp in Vermont. They are greeted by some military officers and other survivors and Anna is shown handing the cure to a man.|$|E

25|$|Wilder {{was born}} on March 13, 1945, in Sydney, Australia, {{the son of an}} American naval officer and an Australian national. He nearly died at birth, but recovered, and almost drowned in a {{swimming}} pool at the age of two. In 1962 or 1963, he pleaded guilty to a gang-rape at a beach in Sydney and was sentenced to probation, during which time he also received electroshock therapy. There is evidence that this treatment exacerbated his violent sexual tendencies. A copy of the novel The Collector by John Fowles, in which a man keeps a <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> cellar against her will until she dies, was found among his possessions after his death.|$|E
25|$|During {{the whole}} trial, the {{prosecution}} presented medical descriptions of Rappe's bladder {{as evidence that}} she had an illness. In his testimony, Arbuckle denied he had any knowledge of Rappe's illness. During cross-examination, Assistant District Attorney Leo Friedman aggressively grilled Arbuckle that he refused to call a doctor when he found Rappe sick, and argued that he refused to do so because he knew of Rappe's illness and saw a perfect opportunity to rape and kill her. Arbuckle calmly maintained that he never physically hurt or sexually assaulted Rappe in any way during the September 5 party, and he also claimed that he never made any inappropriate sexual advances against any <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life. After over two weeks of testimony with 60 prosecution and defense witnesses, including 18 doctors who testified about Rappe's illness, the defense rested. On December 4, 1921, the jury returned five days later deadlocked after nearly 44 hours of deliberation with a 10–2 not guilty verdict, and a mistrial was declared.|$|E
25|$|Irene Shubik {{was born}} in 1929 in Hampstead, London to a Russian Jewish father and a French Jewish mother. When World War II broke out in 1939, she was {{evacuated}} to Canada. She read English literature at University College London, obtaining an MA in “The Use of English History in Drama from 1599-1642”. Uninterested in a career in academia, she applied to join the BBC but was turned down. Unable to obtain work, {{she moved to the}} United States, visiting her brother, the economist Martin Shubik, who was teaching at Princeton University. Meeting with little success in building a career in Princeton, when her brother was called before the Dean of the University for keeping a <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> quarters, she moved to Wilmette, Chicago where her other brother, cancer surgeon Philippe Shubik, was based. Wilmette was the home of Encyclopædia Britannica Films and, impressed by her MA thesis, they hired Shubik as a scriptwriter. Shubik was subsequently offered a twelve-month contract with the National Film Board of Canada but was unable to take up the position as both of her parents had become seriously ill.|$|E

500|$|Emphasis on a {{conflicted}} {{relationship between}} science and religion frequently occurs in both historical studies of Victorian history and Neo-Victorian novels. In his chapter on The French Lieutenant's <b>Woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> book, Evolution and the Uncrucified Jesus, John Glendening argues that Fowles' novel {{is one of the}} first neo-Victorian novels to handle the dynamic created {{between science and}} religion in Victorian identity. Glendening notes that more generally [...] "Christian ideas and conventions become appropriated in the service of a secularist and extensional version of truth." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's release {{followed}} in November 1973, with [...] "Photograph" [...] appearing {{as the third}} track, preceding another Harrison contribution, [...] "Sunshine Life for Me (Sail Away Raymond)". Opposite the printed lyrics for [...] "Photograph" [...] inside the album booklet, a lithograph by Voormann depicted a framed picture on a shelf or desktop, in which Starr looks dejectedly at a framed picture of a <b>woman.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> personal life at this point, the album's arrival coincided with the failure of Starr's marriage, {{partly as a result}} of Harrison and Maureen conducting an affair. While the friendship between the two former bandmates soon recovered, Starr and Harrison would not officially write another song together after [...] "Photograph".|$|E

[...] In chapter 49, High says that when Loki witnessed that Baldr had gained invincibility due to the oath all things took not to harm him, Loki went to Fensalir appearing as a <b>woman.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> disguise, Loki there asked Frigg why Baldr was not harmed by the objects. Frigg revealed that it is due to the oath they have taken. The disguised Loki asks if nothing can hurt Baldr, and Frigg reveals that only mistletoe can, for it seemed to her too young to demand an oath from. After this, Loki immediately disappears, and subsequently engineers the death of Baldr with a mistletoe projectile.|$|E

500|$|In Southey's tale, three {{anthropomorphic}} bears [...] "a Little, Small, Wee Bear, a Middle-sized Bear, and a Great, Huge Bear" [...] {{live together}} {{in a house in}} the woods. Southey describes them as very good-natured, trusting, harmless, tidy, and hospitable. Each of these [...] "bachelor" [...] bears has his own porridge bowl, chair, and bed. One day they make porridge for breakfast, but it's too hot to eat, so take a walk in the woods while their porridge cools. An old woman approaches the bears' house. As she has been sent out by her family, she is a disgrace to them. She is [...] impudent, bad, foul-mouthed, ugly, dirty, and a vagrant deserving of a stint in the House of Correction. She looks through a window, peeps through the keyhole, and lifts the latch. Assured that no one is home, she walks in. The old woman eats the Wee Bear's porridge, then settles into his chair and breaks it. Prowling about, she finds the bears' beds and falls asleep in Wee Bear's bed. The dark end of the tale is reached when the bears return. Wee Bear finds his empty bowl, his broken chair, and the old <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> bed and cries, [...] "Somebody has been lying in my bed, and here she is!" [...] The old woman starts, runs away, breaks her neck and goes to the hospital.|$|E
500|$|Matriarch of the Blues {{received}} mixed critical reception. Allmusic's Matthew Robinson {{wrote that}} James [...] "coast" [...] through the album and the backing band lacked [...] "youthful vitality". Robinson thought the album's opening track [...] "Gotta Serve Somebody" [...] came across {{more as a}} [...] "sleepy suggestion". However, he felt the [...] "draggier pace and intermittent woofs" [...] in [...] "Miss You" [...] added sex appeal and complimented the [...] "funkification" [...] of [...] "Born on the Bayou" [...] and [...] "Hound Dog". Associated Press contributor Gene Bright wrote a positive review of the album but was disappointed with James' cover of [...] "Miss You", writing [...] "the song just can't be slowed and manipulated with any success". People magazine contributors felt that the motorcycle sound in the introduction was unnecessary and considered the album to be more [...] "full-throated gospel-rock" [...] than blues. However, they wrote that James sounded [...] "as sexy and full of sass as she did {{nearly half a century}} ago". With James' sons contributing to the album, Bill Milkowski of JazzTimes called the album a [...] "real family affair" [...] and [...] "worthy follow-up" [...] to Heart of a <b>Woman.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> review for Out, Barry Walters complimented Donto and Sametto's rhythm performances. Walters noted that James lacked all of the vocal notes available to her in the 1960s but wrote that her [...] "interpretive abilities are sharper than ever".|$|E
500|$|As {{in many of}} Argento's films, {{which tend}} to eroticize the murder of {{beautiful}} women, gender, sexuality and power are major issues foregrounded by the film. The fictional novel within the film is described as being [...] "about human perversion {{and its effects on}} society". Male and female sexual deviancy are a central theme, with the victims being sexually liberated women who the first killer – conservative TV presenter Cristiano Berti – refers to as [...] "filthy, slimy perverts". The first victim is a sexually promiscuous shoplifter, and his next two are the lesbian reporter and her bisexual lover. Berti murders the comparatively normal Maria only because she inadvertently discovers his twisted compulsion. His [...] "moral crusade" [...] is inspired by – and in his mind given credibility by – Neal's novel. Neal's own motivations for becoming a killer are revealed in [...] "Freudian flashbacks". As summarized by McDonagh, these flashbacks [...] "expose how the misogyny evident in his books actually stems from being sexually humiliated by a beautiful <b>woman</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> youth." [...] McDonagh also notes that Tenebrae expands on the themes of sexuality and transvestitism found in Argento's earlier films, The Bird with the Crystal Plumage, The Cat o' Nine Tails, Four Flies on Grey Velvet (1972), and Deep Red (1975), but believes that Tenebraes [...] "overall sensuality sets it apart from Argento's other gialli." [...] She says that the film's sexual content and abundant nudity make it [...] "the first of Argento's films to have an overtly erotic aspect", and further notes that [...] "Tenebrae is fraught with free-floating anxiety that is specifically sexual in nature." [...] Gracey notes that in several scenes the victims gaze directly into the camera, which demonstrates Argento's [...] "preoccupation with voyeurism and spectacle".|$|E
