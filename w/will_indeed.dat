After the Whigs' decisive victory in the 1831 election, some speculated that opponents would abstain, rather than openly defy the public <b>will.</b> <b>Indeed,</b> when the Lords voted on the second reading of the bill after a memorable series of debates, many Tory peers did refrain from voting. However, the Lords Spiritual mustered in unusually large numbers, and of 22 present, 21 voted against the Bill. It failed by 41 votes.|$|E

Remember that you <b>will</b> <b>indeed</b> meet your LORD, and that HE <b>will</b> <b>indeed</b> reckon your deeds.

25|$|The Charge Transfer theory {{states that}} a {{lightning}} strike to a protected structure {{can be prevented}} by reducing the electrical potential between the protected structure and the thundercloud. This is done by transferring electric charge (such as from the nearby Earth to the sky or vice versa). Transferring electric charge from the Earth to the sky is done by installing engineered products composed of many points above the structure. It is noted that pointed objects <b>will</b> <b>indeed</b> transfer charge to the surrounding atmosphere and that a considerable electric current can be measured through the conductors as ionization occurs at the point when an electric field is present, such as happens when thunderclouds are overhead.|$|E
25|$|There {{will usually}} be an {{estimate}} of what price the lot will fetch. In an ascending open auction it is considered important {{to get at least}} a 50-percent increase in the bids from start to finish. To accomplish this, the auctioneer must start the auction by announcing a suggested opening bid (SOB) that is low enough to be immediately accepted by one of the bidders. Once there is an opening bid, there will quickly be several other, higher bids submitted. Experienced auctioneers will often select an SOB that is about 45 percent of the (lowest) estimate. Thus there is a certain margin of safety to ensure that there <b>will</b> <b>indeed</b> be a lively auction with many bids submitted. Several observations indicate that the lower the SOB, the higher the final winning bid. This is due to {{the increase in the number}} of bidders attracted by the low SOB.|$|E

500|$|In {{the lyrics}} of [...] "Speak Now", Swift narrates about {{crashing}} her former love's wedding in attempt to win him back. The opening lines acknowledge that, although out of character, Swift is {{still in love with}} her ex-boyfriend and wants to make sure he does not marry the wrong girl. Throughout the song's verses, Swift sneaks in the wedding and describes her observations, such as the bride-to-be's bearing of a poofy wedding gown, her cumulative family, and an organist playing [...] "Bridal Chorus". In [...] "Speak Now"'s refrains, Swift pleads her ex-boyfriend to not say his vows in order to run away with her. The bridge has Swift responding to the priest's calling of [...] "Speak now or forever hold your peace" [...] before repeating the opening lines. The last refrain is altered, with Swift narrating from the groom's perspective and inform Swift they <b>will</b> <b>indeed</b> run away together.|$|E
500|$|In {{a famous}} paper of 1936 with Garrett Birkhoff, the first work ever to {{introduce}} quantum logics, von Neumann and Birkhoff first proved that quantum mechanics requires a propositional calculus substantially {{different from all}} classical logics and rigorously isolated a new algebraic structure for quantum logics. The concept of creating a propositional calculus for quantum logic was first outlined in a short section in von Neumann's 1932 work, but in 1936, {{the need for the}} new propositional calculus was demonstrated through several proofs. For example, photons cannot pass through two successive filters that are polarized perpendicularly (e.g., one horizontally and the other vertically), and therefore, a fortiori, it cannot pass if a third filter polarized diagonally is added to the other two, either before or after them in the succession, but if the third filter is added in between the other two, the photons <b>will,</b> <b>indeed,</b> pass through. This experimental fact is translatable into logic as the non-commutativity of conjunction [...] It was also demonstrated that the laws of distribution of classical logic, [...] and , are not valid for quantum theory.|$|E
