2500|$|Pure {{ethylene}} glycol has a {{specific heat capacity}} about one half that of water. [...] So, while providing freeze protection and an increased boiling point, {{ethylene glycol}} lowers the specific heat capacity of <b>water</b> <b>mixtures</b> relative to pure water. [...] A 1:1 mix by mass has a specific heat capacity of about 3140 J/(kg·°C) (0.75 BTU/(lb·°F)), three quarters that of pure water, thus requiring increased flow rates in same system comparisons with water. The formation of large bubbles in cooling passages of internal combustion engines will seriously inhibit heat flow (flux) from that area, thus allowing nucleation (tiny bubbles) heat transfer to occur is not advisable. Large bubbles in cooling passages will be self-sustaining or grow larger, with virtually {{the complete loss of}} cooling in that spot. With pure MEG that hot spot has to get to 200 °C. Cooling due to other effects such as air draft from fan etc. (not considered in pure nucleation analysis) will assist in preventing large-bubble formation.|$|E

Experiments were conducted in southern Arizona to {{study the effects of}} irrigating wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with a <b>mixture</b> of pump <b>water</b> and waste water and with pump water alone on wheat growth, grain yield, grain quality, soil properties, and irrigation water quality. In small plot research, wheat irrigated with the pump water-waste <b>water</b> <b>mixture</b> produced taller plants, more heads per unit area, heavier seeds, higher grain yields, and higher straw yields than did wheat grown with only pump water. When large fields were compared, wheat grown with the pump water-waste <b>water</b> <b>mixture</b> had taller plants, more lodging, lower grain volume-weights, and higher grain yields than did wheat produced with pump water. The pH and exchangeable sodium of soil irrigated with pump water alone or the pump water-waste <b>water</b> <b>mixture</b> were similar. Soluble salts and nitrate-nitrogen were higher in soils irrigated with pump water than they were in soils irrigated with the pump water-waste <b>water</b> <b>mixture.</b> Extractable phosphorus was higher in soils irrigated with the pump water-waste <b>water</b> <b>mixture</b> than in soils irrigated with pump water.

50|$|A common {{historical}} {{example of}} azeotropic distillation is {{its use in}} dehydrating ethanol and <b>water</b> <b>mixtures.</b> For this, a near azeotropic mixture {{is sent to the}} final column where azeotropic distillation takes place. Several entrainers can be used for this specific process: benzene, pentane, cyclohexane, hexane, heptane, isooctane, acetone, and diethyl ether are all options as the mixture. Of these benzene and cyclohexane have been used the most extensively. However, because benzene has been discovered to be a carcinogenic compound, its use has declined. While this method was the standard for dehydrating ethanol in the past, it has lost favor due to the high capital and energy costs associated with it.Another favorable method and less toxic than using benzene to break the azeotrope of the ethanol-water system is to use toluene instead.|$|E
