5|$|Cloud seeding {{was first}} {{attempted}} by Vincent Schaefer and Irving Langmuir. After witnessing the artificial creation of ice crystals, Langmuir became an enthusiastic proponent of <b>weather</b> <b>modification.</b> Schaefer {{found that when}} he dumped crushed dry ice into a cloud, precipitation {{in the form of}} snow resulted.|$|E
5|$|Due to Langmuir's efforts, and the {{research}} of Schaefer at General Electric, the concept of using cloud seeding to weaken hurricanes gathered momentum. Indeed, Schaefer had caused a major snowstorm on December 20, 1946 by seeding a cloud. This caused GE to drop out for legal reasons. Schaefer and Langmuir assisted the U.S. military as advisors for Project Cirrus, the first large study of cloud physics and <b>weather</b> <b>modification.</b> Its most important goal {{was to try to}} weaken hurricanes.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Debbie was {{an intense}} and {{long-lived}} hurricane that formed during August 1969. The fifth tropical cyclone, fourth named storm, third hurricane and second major hurricane of the 1969 Atlantic hurricane season, Debbie formed on August 14 {{in the southern}} Atlantic Ocean and took a general northwesterly path until turning northward into the central Atlantic. The storm was characterized by numerous fluctuations in intensity, and it reached winds corresponding to Category 3 status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale on four separate occasions. The hurricane bypassed the island of Bermuda to the southeast on August 22, before ultimately brushing southeastern Newfoundland with strong winds. It dissipated over the cold waters east of Greenland. Although Debbie {{had little effect on}} land, it was extensively researched and was subject to a <b>weather</b> <b>modification</b> experiment by Project Stormfury, in which it was seeded with silver iodide.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} {{result of}} the 11 November bombing halt was that the average daily sortie rate over southern Laos rose to 620 per day before the new campaign had even begun. The freeing of aircraft (Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps) {{that had previously been}} participating in Rolling Thunder, when combined with those from Steel Tiger and Tiger Hound (which were both superseded by Commando Hunt), promised to create an interdiction effort of unprecedented scale. The new sensor-directed effort would see, for the first time, continuous round-the-clock bombing of the communist logistical system. During daylight, the missions would be performed by propeller-driven and jet fighter-bombers and B-52s. At night, fixed-wing gunships would prowl for prey. The new effort would also be supported by aerial defoliation missions (Operation Ranch Hand) and the cloud-seeding <b>weather</b> <b>modification</b> effort known as Operation Popeye (see Ho Chi Minh Trail). On 15 November 1968 the Seventh Air Force was granted authorization for launch of Commando Hunt.|$|E
5|$|Myers {{made one}} hundred oxy-hydrogen balloon bombs for the {{government}} to do a full scale experiment of producing rain. The balloons were 10, 12, and 20 feet in diameter. The purpose of the Texas experiment was to see if making artificial rain could be done by man-made <b>weather</b> <b>modification.</b> After the experiment took place it was reported that the result was a success of what was hoped for. The news press release of August 20, 1891, reported that rain was made to fall two days before at three o'clock in the afternoon. At the time the sky was clear and there was no prediction of rain in the area for at least a week. The claim was that the rain produced was directly or indirectly caused by the explosion of the oxygen-hydrogen balloon bombs that were exploded electrically at altitudes of 1800 to 3000 feet. That started a sequence of events that lead to a torrent. The rain storm that ensued was reported by ranchers and railroad linemen for some thousand miles across several states. After this Myers was contracted by paper companies in New York state to see about producing rain in their forests that needed it badly. He contended that the Mohawk Valley was {{a good place to start}} rain and that the rainfall then would go to the Adirondack Mountains and Catskill Mountains.|$|E

40|$|The present thesis explores whether mentalization-based {{psychotherapy}} (MBT), on theoretical grounds, may {{be applicable}} {{in the treatment}} of patients with avoidant and paranoid personality disorders. We describe the development of mentalization and the principles of MBT. Characteristics of the two diagnostic groups in question are presented and compared with borderline personality disorder, for which the effectiveness of MBT has been empirically documented. We discuss whether patients with avoidant and paranoid personality disorders have mentalizing failures and whether MBT might be an applicable treatment alternative for such disorders. If so, we further explore <b>weather</b> <b>modifications</b> are needed in order to increase the effectiveness of MBT treatment for the relevant diagnostic groups. Our analyses indicate that both patients with avoidant and patients with paranoid personality disorders consistently manifest mentalizing failures. We therefore suggest that MBT might be useful for these patients, but in order to achieve optimal results, the treatment needs to be adapted. Finally, we provide some ideas for potential modifications for each personality disorder. As our conclusions are only tentative, there is a need of studies, empirically addressing the effect of MBT for avoidant and paranoid personality disorders...|$|R

25|$|Cloud seeding, {{a form of}} <b>weather</b> <b>modification,</b> is {{the attempt}} to change the amount or type of {{precipitation}} that falls from clouds, by dispersing substances into the air that serve as cloud condensation or ice nuclei, which alter the microphysical processes within the cloud. The usual intent is to increase precipitation but hail and fog suppression are also widely practiced in airports.

40|$|SUMMARY A {{possible}} {{approach for}} the development of simple predictive methods of shoreface profile evolution is described. By application of a detailed process-based, cross-shore morphodynamic model and of some inductive assumptions we build simple descriptions which reproduce possible behaviours of the upper zones of shoreface profile as a function of time. The paper introduces the model concept and describes its application on the base of diffusion-type formulations while distinguishing time scales from seasons, to years and decades. These scales correspond lo bar and berm formation, to the life-time of profile nourishments, as far as major human induced modifications are concerned, and to the time scales of <b>weather</b> pattern <b>modifications</b> and sea-level rise as far as natural effects are concerned...|$|R
