5|$|One {{of the key}} aims of {{the astronomers}} who {{designed}} the Hubble Space Telescope was to use its high optical resolution to study distant galaxies {{to a level of}} detail that was not possible from the ground. Positioned above the atmosphere, Hubble avoids atmospheric airglow allowing it to take more sensitive visible and ultraviolet light images than can be obtained with seeing-limited ground-based telescopes (when good adaptive optics correction at visible wavelengths becomes possible, 10m ground-based telescopes may become competitive). Although the telescope's mirror suffered from spherical aberration when the telescope was launched in 1990, it could still be used to take images of more distant galaxies than had previously been obtainable. Because light takes billions of years to reach Earth from very distant galaxies, <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> as they were billions of years ago; thus, extending the scope of such research to increasingly distant galaxies allows {{a better understanding of how}} they evolve.|$|E

25|$|The RGB color {{model is}} {{additive}} {{in the sense}} that the three light beams are added together, and their light spectra add, wavelength for wavelength, to make the final color's spectrum. This is essentially opposite to the subtractive color model that applies to paints, inks, dyes, and other substances whose color depends on reflecting the light under which <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>them.</b> Because of properties, these three colours create white, this is in stark contrast to physical colours, such as dyes which create black when mixed.|$|E
25|$|Roman {{influences}} may {{be found}} around us today, in banks, government buildings, great houses, and even small houses, perhaps {{in the form of}} a porch with Doric columns and a pediment or in a fireplace or a mosaic shower floor derived from a Roman original, often from Pompeii or Herculaneum. The mighty pillars, domes and arches of Rome echo in the New World too, where in Washington DC <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> in the Capitol Building, the White House, the Lincoln Memorial and other government buildings. All across the US the seats of regional government were normally built in the grand traditions of Rome, with vast flights of stone steps sweeping up to towering pillared porticoes, with huge domes gilded or decorated inside with the same or similar themes that were popular in Rome.|$|E

Kitsis commented, [...] "We couldn’t think of anyone better to trap two {{children}} in a house and try to eat them." [...] Caulfield had previously worked with series writer Jane Espenson and producer Liz Tigelaar on Buffy and Life Unexpected. Morrison remarked that while viewers do not see the Blind Witch in Maine, [...] "Everyone who is in fairytale land definitely has a Storybrooke counterpart.

500|$|Chapter VI {{begins by}} saying the next three {{chapters}} will address possible objections to the theory, the first being that often no intermediate forms between closely related species are found, though the theory implies such forms must have existed. As Darwin noted, [...] "Firstly, why, if species have descended from other species by insensibly fine gradations, do we not everywhere see innumerable transitional forms? [...] Why is not all nature in confusion, instead of the species being, as <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>them,</b> well defined?" [...] Darwin attributed this to the competition between different forms, combined with {{the small number of}} individuals of intermediate forms, often leading to extinction of such forms. This difficulty can be referred to as the absence or rarity of transitional varieties in habitat space.|$|E
500|$|Kelly West of Cinema Blend focused {{primarily}} on the series finale in her review but referred to this episode as containing a solid case-of-the-week. “Overall {{it was a good}} mystery-of-the-week but seeing as it was the second to last episode, the only thing I cared about was that we finally got more Weevil!” Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a mixed review, stating that the case-of-the-week was an oversimplification of the overall themes of Veronica Mars. The reviewer enjoyed the potential for Logan and Dick’s character development, although he felt that it was blunted by the knowledge that the series was about to end. “As fun as this episode is, the lack of the fourth season stops me from fully enjoying it. [...] But the knowledge that this might be the last time <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> puts a damper on things. Still, better to go out with good episodes than bad.” ...|$|E
500|$|When Vaughan first pitched [...] "Pride & Joy" [...] to Marvel, they {{immediately}} accepted it and set Runaways in the Marvel Universe, the main string of story lines that ties Marvel's canonical series. However, unlike most series (which are often set in New York City), Runaways {{is set in}} Los Angeles, an unexplored area of the Marvel Universe. This, in turn, marked a significance for the story arc at the time; being a new series, [...] "Pride & Joy" [...] had been expected {{to take place in}} New York City. Matt Fraction, a prominent writer for various Marvel Comics series quotes, [...] "It was sort of great to see in Runaways that California was such a blank slate. It was refreshing to watch Brian create this sort of whole cloth." [...] Vaughan's decision prompted Fraction to create a new series to take place in Los Angeles as well. Several notable landmarks in this story arc include Malibu, the Griffith Observatory, the James Dean memorial and Bronson Canyon in Griffith Park. In an interview with Comic Book Resources, Brian K. Vaughan quoted, [...] "I imagine that Angelinos in the Marvel Universe think of super heroes and villains the way that New Yorkers think of Hollywood celebrities. <b>We</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> on TV every day, so we know that they exist, but they still seem distant and unreal." ...|$|E

500|$|Janet Maslin of The New York Times {{called it}} [...] "a true movie milestone, {{presenting}} awe- and fear-inspiring sights {{never before seen}} on the screen... On paper, this story is tailor-made for Mr. Spielberg's talents... t becomes less crisp on screen than {{it was on the}} page, with much of the enjoyable jargon either mumbled confusingly or otherwise thrown away." [...] In Rolling Stone, Peter Travers described the film as [...] "colossal entertainment—the eye-popping, mind-bending, kick-out-the-jams thrill ride of summer and probably the year [...] Compared with the dinos, the characters are dry bones, indeed. Crichton and co-screenwriter David Koepp have flattened them into nonentities on the trip from page to screen." [...] Roger Ebert noted, [...] "The movie delivers all too well on its promise to show us dinosaurs. <b>We</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> early and often, and they are indeed a triumph of special effects artistry, but the movie is lacking other qualities that it needs even more, such as a sense of awe and wonderment, and strong human story values." [...] Henry Sheehan argued, [...] "The complaints over Jurassic Parks lack of story and character sound a little off the point," [...] pointing out the story arc of Grant learning to protect Hammond's grandchildren despite his initial dislike of them. Empire magazine gave the film five stars, hailing it as [...] "quite simply one of the greatest blockbusters of all time." ...|$|E

I have respect {{for their ability to}} come up with great ideas. So I think yes, they are challenged by the customers the same way we are to surprise them with innovation.

2500|$|Dennett's reply {{from natural}} selection:Suppose that, by some mutation, {{a human being}} is born {{that does not have}} Searle's [...] "causal properties" [...] but {{nevertheless}} acts exactly like a human being. (This sort of animal is called a [...] "zombie" [...] in thought experiments in the philosophy of mind). This new animal would reproduce just as any other human and eventually there would be more of these zombies. Natural selection would favor the zombies, since their design is (we could suppose) a bit simpler. Eventually the humans would die out. So therefore, if Searle is right, it is most likely that human beings (as <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> today) are actually [...] "zombies", who nevertheless insist they are conscious. It is impossible to know whether we are all zombies or not. Even if we are all zombies, we would still believe that we are not.|$|E
2500|$|On February 14, 1962, Jacqueline took American {{television}} viewers {{on a tour}} of the White House with Charles Collingwood of CBS News. In the tour she stated that [...] "I feel so strongly that the White House should have as fine a collection of American pictures as possible. It's so important... the setting in which the presidency is presented to the world, to foreign visitors. The American people should be proud of it. We have such a great civilization. So many foreigners don't realize it. I think this house should be the place <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> best." [...] The film was watched by 56 million {{television viewers}} in the United States, and was later distributed to 106 countries. Kennedy won a special Academy of Television Arts & Sciences Trustees Award for it at the Emmy Awards in 1962, which was accepted on her behalf by Lady Bird Johnson.

2500|$|Bianca's rape {{was heavily}} debated; viewers who despised the storyline argued the rape as [...] "punishment" [...] for her sexuality, and as unnecessary; others {{felt that it}} realistically {{captured}} what gay women sometimes face from men who want to force themselves on lesbians. When GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) was asked by Metro Weekly why GLAAD sent out an action alert voicing their concern over the rape of Bianca, but two days later sent out another release which seemed to support how the storyline was told, Joan M. Garry, {{executive director of the}} organization, responded that they had [...] "some concerns" [...] about [...] and [...] "that the broader context of the [...] genre kind of needs to be taken into account." [...] Metro Weekly felt that this did not answer their question. They wanted to know why there was a sudden reversal in GLAAD's statement, specifically citing that GLAAD's second press release spoke of rape experience for lesbians and how men who rape lesbians not only engage in gender based acts of violence, but in acts of hate violence, and that this release was supportive of how Bianca's rape storyline was told, as opposed to GLAAD's first press release on the matter. Garry said she felt that their first press release concerning Bianca's rape was premature. Metro Weekly countered by asking what is the [...] "actual process" [...] GLAAD uses to select what to criticize, what raises their organization's red flags. [...] "There's a whole host of input we receive about things as we hear about them, as <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> in script form, as <b>we</b> <b>see</b> <b>them</b> in pilots," [...] Garry relayed. [...] "We have a strong team of program folks who represent different regions around the country, different communities. We get an awful lot of stuff that comes across the transom via our website raising concerns. And we did get quite a number of concerns coming over email, particularly about All My Children." [...] Garry continued, [...] "So it's basically community feedback, {{as well as some of}} our own observations and perceptions. Combine that with conversations that we have with folks that are actually producing the images and we really try to work our way through those different opinions and shape a position we think makes sense." ...|$|E
