50|$|Some {{machines}} (which are not unduly large) {{are integrated}} with vapour degreasing machines using hydrocarbon cleaning fluids: Three tanks {{are used in}} a cascade. The lower tank containing dirty fluid is heated causing the fluid to evaporate. At {{the top of the}} machine there is a refrigeration coil. Fluid condenses on the coil and falls into the upper tank. The upper tank eventually overflows and clean fluid runs into the <b>work</b> <b>tank</b> where the cleaning takes place. Purchase price is higher than simpler machines, but such machines are economical in the long run. The same fluid can be reused many times, minimising wastage and pollution.|$|E

5000|$|With {{the decline}} of the Rohana sub-kingdom and the defeat of Polonnaruwa, coming with the rise of Chola power, i.e., from about the 13th century CE, these regions became wild. The many {{irrigation}} <b>works</b> (<b>tanks</b> etc., which exist even today) became home to malaria( [...] see History of Sri Lanka). In the meantime, the eastern coastal region remained less affected by Malaria and began to be occupied. Thus seafaring people who had begun to settle down alongthe coast since the Anuradhapura times, c. 6th Century CE began to flourish. The forests continued to be dominated by the Veddha population which claimed kingship ("cross-cousins") with the Sinhala kings of Kandy.|$|R

500|$|The {{window glass}} {{manufacturing}} process used by Hartford City Glass {{was known as}} the Cylinder Method. [...] The process was labor-intensive, and required the services of a glass blower and glass cutter—who were both highly skilled and well paid. The glass blower led a small production crew that included skilled and unskilled workers. At older plants, the glass blower's workstation was adjacent to a ceramic pot located inside the furnace. Each pot contained molten glass created by melting a batch of ingredients that included sand, soda, and lime. [...] At newer plants such as the Hartford City <b>works,</b> <b>tanks</b> were used instead of pots. The tanks were essentially huge brick pots with multiple workstations. A tank furnace is more efficient than a pot furnace, but more costly to build.|$|R

40|$|Today {{works in}} cosmos and at great sea depths are {{becoming}} very current. In order to execute these <b>works</b> <b>tanks</b> with great mass perfection are needed, {{which represents the}} relation of the product of pressure and inner volume to its mass. Usually such tanks are usually produced as a cocoon by winding methods, which can be automated. The simplest model of a cocoon is a cylinder with hemispheric blinds at the edges. The radial stresses arise in thick walled composite cylinders due to anisotropic thermal shrinkage during cooling process after curing. It also can lead to formation of radial cracks. The results of the analyses when a material is simplified to a homogenous orthotropic material show a very small residual radial stress value. In this paper we have used discrete model to evaluate residual radial stresses in thick-walled unidirectional filament wound cylinder and the results were compared to the results of homogenous orthotropic model...|$|R
