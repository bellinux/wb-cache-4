A hundred is the outside number, and doubtless we shall be able to gather other recruits should we choose to raise the band to that number; but all who follow me must obey me as implicitly as did my own tribesmen in our struggle with the Romans, and must swear to do no harm to innocent people, and to abstain from all violence and robbery. I am ready to be a leader of outlaws but not of brigands. I desire only to live a free life among the mountains. If the Romans come against us we will fight against them, and the spoil we may take from them is lawful booty, to be used in exchange for such things as we may require.

As I said I have money enough to buy everything we want at present, and can obtain more if necessary, so that there is no reason for us to rob these poor people of their goods. Here we are too near Rome for them to be disaffected, but further south we shall find them not unwilling to aid us, for the provinces are ground into the dust by the exactions necessary to pay for the cost of the rebuilding of Rome and to support the extravagance of Nero." ...|$|R

I {{would like to say}} it was the easiest thing I have ever done, but at the beginning it was a terrifying experience. I remember getting on the plane and hyperventilating because I thought I wasn’t prepared. My mind was racing with questions like “How can I manage the language? <b>Will</b> I <b>make</b> <b>friends?</b> Are Chileans nice?” I remember getting on the plane about to leave my country for half a year and thinking “Maybe there is still time to change my mind. ” Luckily I didn’t change my mind and went through with it. It was the best experience of my life! What finally calmed me down on that hot July night was some prayer. I started breathing slowly and reciting those good old “Our Fathers” and “Hail Marys” I had learned as a toddler. I amazingly felt myself being calmed and almost immediately fell asleep. I woke up in Santiago de Chile. This was perhaps my first religious experience while studying abroad. Little did I know that there would be many more to come that would further teach me what people could do with the power of faith. 2 ̆...|$|R
