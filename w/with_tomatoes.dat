5|$|In {{addition}} to those in Italian Food, there are many Italian recipes and descriptions {{of the land and}} the people in David's other works. The first recipe in her first book, Mediterranean Food—soupe au Pistou—is of Genoese origin. Also in that book are recipes for bocconcini, osso bucco, and several Italian pasta and chicken dishes. Among the recipes in Summer Cooking is peperonata (pimentos or sweet peppers cooked <b>with</b> <b>tomatoes</b> in olive oil and butter) which was reprinted as the title article in a later selection from David's works. In An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, David printed Italian recipes including soups and omelettes made with hops (zuppa di lupolli and frittata con i loertis). Also in that book are substantial essays on Italian people and places. Is There a Nutmeg in the House? includes a six-page article on vegetable dishes from Mantua, and another of similar length on the variations of pizza in Italy and beyond.|$|E

25|$|Seafood is also popular, {{especially}} in coastal areas. The variety of fish {{available to the}} area has resulted in several fish-based Brodetti (broths), coming from such places as Vasto, Giulianova, and Pescara. These broths are often made by cooking fish, flavored <b>with</b> <b>tomatoes,</b> herbs, and peperoncino, in an earthenware pot.|$|E

A number of fruits are grown for both domestic consumption and market such as melons, papaya, watermelon, mangos, bananas, tamarind and citrus.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} Guernsey was loading ships <b>with</b> <b>tomatoes</b> rather than people {{indicates}} {{the lack of}} panic; ships from Guernsey and Jersey designated to carry evacuees were sometimes packed, but others did not sail to their full capacity. No hospital ship had arrived to take the elderly and sick away. Several ships, including the Guernsey lifeboat, were machine gunned by German aircraft however with enemy aircraft and submarines operating in the Channel, it was lucky that no evacuation ship was sunk.|$|E
25|$|Several ships {{including}} the Southern Railway SS Isle of Sark, the normal cross channel ferry, were docked in St Peter Port harbour on 28 June when the Luftwaffe arrived and six Heinkel He 111 bombers attacked Guernsey.

The bomb damage was mainly to the harbour where lorries loaded <b>with</b> <b>tomatoes</b> for export were lined up, 34 people died. A similar attack occurred in Jersey where nine died. That night the Isle of Sark sailed for England with 647 refugees, she was the last ship to sail, its Captain, Hervy H. Golding being awarded an OBE for his actions that day.|$|E

25|$|Shevardnadze's {{rapid rise}} in Soviet Georgia's {{political}} hierarchy {{was the result}} of his campaign against corruption. Throughout most of Shevardnadze's leadership, anti-corruption campaigns were central to his authority and policy. By the time Shevardnadze had become leader, Georgia was the Soviet republic most afflicted by corruption. The rule of Vasil Mzhavanadze had been characterised by weak leadership, nepotism, despotism, and bribery pervading the upper echelons of power. In Georgia, corruption had been allowed to thrive, leading to serious deformations in the system; for example only 68 per cent of Georgian goods were exported legally, while the percentage of goods exported legally from other Soviet Republics approached 100 per cent. Shevardnadze rallied support for his anti-corruption campaigns by establishing the Study of Public Opinion. To combat corruption, he engaged in subterfuge; after halting all exports he dressed himself as a peasant and drove a car filled <b>with</b> <b>tomatoes</b> through the border. After his personal subterfuge, the entire Georgian border police was purged. While never proven, it is said that after taking office, Shevardnadze asked all leading officials to show their left hands and ordered those who used Western-produced watches to replace them with Soviet ones. This story portrayed Shevardnadze as an active battler against corruption. His campaign against corruption was largely unsuccessful and when he returned to Georgia in 1992, corruption was still a huge problem.|$|E

500|$|The BLT Cookbook {{begins with}} a recipe for a mini-cocktail {{selection}} of the BLT, followed by a larger version that the author recommends for large gatherings such as picnics. Non-traditional presentations of the BLT combination include [...] "Tomatoes Stuffed with Bacon Risotto", [...] "Potato Soup <b>with</b> <b>Tomatoes</b> and Bacon" [...] and [...] "Tomato Bread Pudding". The author presents varieties of the BLT that omit one ingredient. [...] "The Fisherman's BLT"which uses seafoodis {{an alternative to the}} standard sandwich and the [...] "ZLT" [...] comprises zucchini, lettuce and tomato.

500|$|The {{vegetables}} {{most commonly}} added to borscht are beetroots, white cabbage, carrots, parsley root, potatoes, onions and tomatoes. Some recipes may also call for beans, tart apples, turnip, celeriac, zucchini or bell peppers. Parsnip {{may be used}} as a substitute for parsley root, and tomato paste is often used as well as or instead of fresh tomatoes. The traditional technique of preparing the soup is to precook the vegetables – by sautéing, braising, boiling or baking – separately from the meat and only then to combine them with the stock. This distinctive feature of borscht derives from the practice of slow cooking in the Russian oven (traditional masonry stove, used for both cooking and heating), wherein the differences in cooking times of individual ingredients had {{to be taken into account}} in order to ensure that all components reach doneness at the same time. The importance of this method is reflected in the Russian language, where a variant in which all vegetables are added raw directly into the stock is referred to by the diminutive form [...] rather than [...] Vegetables are usually julienned, except for potatoes and zucchini, which are diced. The beetroots may be partially baked before being sprinkled with vinegar or lemon juice to preserve the color and braised separately from other vegetables. Onions, carrots, parsley root, turnip and other root vegetables are sautéed (traditionally in animal fat, especially lard or butter) and then mixed <b>with</b> <b>tomatoes</b> or tomato paste. Dry beans are boiled separately. Potatoes and cabbage are boiled in the stock for about 15 minutes before the precooked vegetables are added.|$|E

2500|$|In his lifetime, Cohl's {{most famous}} film was Le Peintre néo-impressionniste , made in 1910. [...] An artist is {{sketching}} a classically draped model holding a broom as a stick-figure when a collector storms in {{demanding to know}} the progress of his work. [...] The artist shows the collector a series of blank colored canvases (the film is color-tinted). As he gives their ridiculous titles, the collector imagines them being drawn on the canvas. For example, the red canvas is A cardinal eating lobster <b>with</b> <b>tomatoes</b> by {{the banks of the}} Red Sea. [...] The collector is soon so delirious that he buys every blank canvas he can see. Quite obviously, the artist is not a neo-Impressionist (the name taken from the latest vogue in Paris)--he's an Incoherent.|$|E
2500|$|The bhaajis are {{vegetable}} dishes {{made with}} a particular vegetable or a combination. They {{require the use of}} [...] goda (sweet) masala, essentially consisting of some combination of onion, garlic, ginger, red chilli powder, green chillies and mustard. Depending on the caste or specific religious tradition of a family, onion and garlic may not be used in cooking. A particular variant of bhaaji is the rassa or curry. Vegetarians prepare rassa or curry of potatoes and or cauliflower <b>with</b> <b>tomatoes</b> or fresh coconut kernel and plenty of water to produce a soup-like preparation rather than bhaaji. Varan is nothing but plain dal, a common Indian lentil stew. Aamti is variant of the curry, typically consisting of a lentil (tur) stock, flavoured with goda masala, tamarind or amshul, and jaggery (gul).|$|E
2500|$|The wave {{of protests}} started on 1 September 2013 with a {{national}} mobilization and continued until late-December. The protests attracted up to 200,000 demonstrators in 50 Romanian cities and 30 cities in Romanian diaspora. Largest demonstrations were organized in Bucharest (20,000 people), Cluj-Napoca (10,000 people), Câmpeni (4,000 people), Iași (1,500 people) and Brașov (900 people). In Bucharest, Timișoara and Iași, protesters created [...] "tent cities", paralyzing traffic on major arteries of circulation. The protests, dubbed by international media the Romanian Autumn, have taken many forms: human chains around the Palace of the Parliament, flash mobs, roadblocks and scuffles with police. Although the protests were mainly peaceful, {{there were reports of}} serious incidents. On 13 September, Minister of Culture Daniel Barbu was attacked <b>with</b> <b>tomatoes</b> in Cluj-Napoca. In November, protesters in Bucharest, Brașov and Cluj-Napoca were aggressed and sprayed with irritant substances by gendarmes, in the capital 62 people being fined for blocking traffic. Likewise, on 9 December, about 50 Greenpeace activists from 10 countries who were protesting in the courtyard of the Parliament building, were seized by gendarmes and led to the police stations. Protesters also accused the poor coverage of the protests by Romanian media.|$|E
