For instance, a word that started in the first position of the first line (line one, position one) would be worth two points, whereas a word on the same line but with the first letter in the eighth position (line one, position eight) would be worth nine points. Halfway through the round, a bell would ring and the teammates would switch seats. This occurred after six questions had been asked; after another six were asked, the bell rang again and the team that was in the lead when it rang the second time won the Elimination Round.|$|E

25|$|In late 1858, the {{ownership}} of the building transferred to Auckland Province, but with an agreement that parliament would continue to use it, and it continued {{to be referred to}} as the General Assembly House. After 1858, some additions were made to the building. The system of provincial government was abolished in 1876 and ownership transferred back to the Crown. In 1883, the building additions that initially housed Auckland's district (or magistrates) court were made available to the newly established Auckland University College, and laboratories and lecture rooms for the chemistry department were established here. The original part of the building remained for use by the Survey and Crown Lands Department. Parliament passed the 'Auckland University College Reserves Act 1885' and that allowed for the main building and the land it <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> also be transferred to the college, which happened in 1890. The college used the meeting room of the House of Representatives for general and mathematics lectures. The lower story of the original building became the college library and the registrar's office. The former Bellamy's (parliamentary refreshment room, i.e. a club where liquor could be purchased) in an adjacent building became the office of the college chairman. The college's geology museum was housed in the buildings, as were lecture rooms for classics and a girls' common room.|$|E
25|$|Back in Arendelle {{after the}} meeting, Ingrid is {{determined}} to use Elsa by manipulating her to turn on Anna. She 'warns' Elsa that her sister is plotting to trap her inside the urn, just as Gerda did to Ingrid in the past, instructing Elsa to talk to Anna herself in the palace dungeon cell. Unknown to Ingrid, Elsa is only pretending to believe her aunt, and when she visits Anna in her jail cell, the two sisters decide it's best to play along with Ingrid's lie. The two {{come up with a}} plan to place Ingrid back inside the urn when she least expects it; so Elsa breaks Anna out of the cell, and with help from Kristoff they search the closed-off east wing of the castle, and find the urn in a closet (along with a still-frozen Hans). They also find a cracked mirror with a missing fragment, which unknown to them, is the Mirror of Shattered Sight. Anna takes the urn into her cell to wait for Ingrid to come check on her. Unfortunately, Ingrid <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> their scheme; she had been waiting for Anna all along, and Anna finds herself trapped in the cell with her.|$|E

In the second chapter, [...] "Why Risk a Music Career?", Lopez is interviewed by her sister Lynda Lopez, who oversees each interview segment, {{about the risks of}} starting a music career after having an already thriving movie career. Critics believed that she was only launching a music career with an intent to expand her brand, while Lopez felt as if it was simply the [...] "next natural step" [...] in her career. Lopez's manager Benny Medina further discusses this, labeling her as the [...] "ultimate" [...] triple threat – [...] "the actor, singer and dancer". Lopez then confers, in the chapter [...] "Press Tours / Promotions", about the extensive promotional schedule she <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> promote the album. She examines the differences in promoting an album and a film, stating that promoting an album is more [...] "personal" [...] as it is something that is [...] "closer to your heart" [...] and something she [...] "really believes in". According to Lopez, {{by the end of the}} promotional tour for the album she [...] "lost" [...] her voice from the amount of interviews she had. Following this, Lopez's performance of the Darkchild remix of [...] "If You Had My Love" [...] at the 1999 VH1 Fashion Awards is shown.|$|E
500|$|Hendrix {{was not as}} {{confident}} {{a singer}} as he was a guitarist, and because he strongly disliked anyone watching him sing he asked the engineers at Olympic to construct a privacy barrier {{between him and the}} control room. This created problems when the studio lights were low, and the engineers were unable to see him, making his visual cues and prompts difficult to communicate. As was the case at De Lane Lea, Hendrix's penchant for using multiple amplifiers at extreme volume drew criticism and complaints from the people living and working near to the studio. Olympic tape operator George Chkiantz recalled: [...] "Sometimes, it got so loud we'd turn the [...] monitors off and there was really very little difference." [...] Chkiantz noted that reactions to Hendrix's music were not always positive: [...] "I seem to recall a lot of musicians, a lot of people, saying, 'I can't see what all the fuss is about myself', or 'I don't know how you listen to all that noise; I'd be scared to work with him'... Chas was convinced that he <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> something. Not everyone was convinced that Chas was right." [...] Another issue that complicated the sessions were the large number of female fans who would show up at the studio wanting to watch the Experience record. As a habit, Hendrix would indiscriminately tell people where they would be on any given day, which led to large groups of fans following him everywhere. Olympic employees were tasked with keeping them under control and at a safe distance so as to not unduly burden the recording process. Chkiantz commented: [...] "It was extraordinary. I worked with the Stones. I worked with the Beatles. I worked with Led Zeppelin. I was not as jumpy; it was not as difficult as with Hendrix. It was something of an open house. Hendrix was not difficult at all, but I personally would have preferred not to have loads of girls lurking in the woodwork." ...|$|E

2500|$|David told Arthur {{they were}} going to restore Excalibur right this second and {{revealed}} that Emma was the Dark One and that Lancelot was back. David believed that he had brought the dagger to hand over, but Mary Margaret brought it to Lancelot to hide, who then took her to the place that he and Guinevere had discovered. Mary Margaret realized that she has been here before in a vision where Emma pulled her heart out, but before they can carry out their plan a deranged Arthur arrived and pulled a sword on them and demanded Mary Margaret hand over the dagger. Arthur reveals that he was planning to use the Dagger to have Emma restore Excalibur, and then, he planned to kill Merlin with Excalibur and become the most powerful king in all the realms. Arthur then uses the dagger to try to command Emma to come to him, only to realize that he was fooled by Mary Margaret, as the dagger she gave him was a fake, and David <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> this plan all along. The threesome took Arthur to Granny’s Diner, where Guinevere arrived and uncuffed him. Aware that Guinevere was still under a spell, she broke Lancelot's heart by telling him that she loved Arthur.

In his last quarterfinals appearance before the French Open, he was defeated by Marin Čilić at the BMW Open in Munich. Youzhny was seeded 27th at the French Open, and lost {{in the third round}} to world number six David Ferrer. The match is notable for Youzhny apologizing to the crowd about his performance by writing [...] "SORRI" [...] in the clay. His grass season began with a semi-finals showing at the Gerry Weber Open in Halle, losing to Roger Federer. At Wimbledon, Youzhny, seeded 26th, won his fourth round match {{for the first time on}} seven attempts to reach the quarterfinals.
