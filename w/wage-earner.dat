25|$|On February 18, 1965, C. T. Vivian led a {{march to}} the {{courthouse}} in Marion, the county seat of neighboring Perry County, to protest the arrest of James Orange. State officials had received orders to target Vivian, and a line of Alabama state troopers waited for the marchers at the Perry County courthouse. Officials had turned off all of the nearby street lights, and state troopers rushed at the protesters, attacking them. Protesters Jimmie Lee Jackson and his mother fled the scene to hide in a nearby café. Alabama State Trooper corporal James Bonard Fowler followed Jackson into the café and shot him, saying he thought the protester {{was trying to get}} his gun as they grappled. Jackson died eight days later at Selma's Good Samaritan Hospital, of an infection resulting from the gunshot wound. Jackson was the only male <b>wage-earner</b> of his household, which lived in extreme poverty. Jackson's father, mother, wife, and children were left with no source of income.|$|E
25|$|While the Liberal {{reforms were}} one of Britain's most ambitious welfare reform programmes, there were several {{limitations}} to the reforms they passed. Free school meals were not compulsory. Pensions were refused {{to those who had}} not been in work most of their life and life expectancy at birth at this time was only 55 so relatively few people lived long enough to receive a pension. The labour exchange programme often managed to find people only part-time casual work. The poor had to pay National Insurance Contributions out of their wages and the 7s 6d was not enough to live on. Unemployment and sickness pay also only lasted for a limited time. Free medical care was available to only a <b>wage-earner,</b> not the wife or children or grandparents and other relatives. The new National Health Insurance scheme also did not provide coverage for all forms of medical care. It did not provide cover for special advice while many people could not get acquire dental, ophthalmic or other treatment through NHI. Also, other people were not covered for convalescent homes, while the only specialist services for those in NHI were for TB and VD. The welfare measures introduced by the Liberal government concerning the sick, the elderly, and the children did, however, lead to a reduction in poverty, with the total number of paupers falling from 916,377 in 1910 to 748,019 by 1914.|$|E

2500|$|Unemployment {{originated}} in Poland {{in the late}} 19th century, and appeared {{as a result of}} industrialization. In Russian-ruled Congress Poland, the 1904 onset of war with Japan caused a depression that deepened with the following year's revolution. Meanwhile, efforts by the government to shift industry to Russia proper led to long-term industrial recession. Massive unemployment of factory workers ensued, in turn prompting both urban and rural Poles to emigrate. In the Second Polish Republic (1918–1939), unemployment was among the worst problems of the economy, particularly during the Great Depression (1929–1934). The number of registered unemployed jumped from 185,000 in 1928 to 466,000 in 1936; in 1932, there were 240,000 unemployed industrial workers, or one-third of the total in that field. Not only industrial workers but also members of the intelligentsia were affected. Official statistics for the period only account for non-farm wage and salary earners who registered as unemployed with a labor exchange. Thus, government data account for just part of the actual number of jobless. One scholar calculated a non-farm <b>wage-earner</b> unemployment rate of 13% for 1929 and 25% for 1931, estimating a [...] "substantially higher" [...] figure for 1938, given natural increase in the urban population and migration from rural areas.|$|E

60|$|On January 3, 1900, Governor Roosevelt {{sent his}} last annual {{message to the}} State legislature. It was an able document, and as it was now {{recognized}} everywhere {{that he was a}} truly national figure, it was given careful attention. It treated of the corruption in canal management, of the franchise tax, of taxation in general, and a large portion was devoted to the trusts. At that time the trusts were receiving great attention everywhere, and it was felt that what the governor had to say about them, that they were largely over-capitalized, that they misrepresented the condition of their affairs, that they promoted unfair competition, and that they wielded increased power over the <b>wage-earner,</b> was strictly true.|$|E
60|$|Another {{objection}} {{to a program}} {{which is to be}} realized suddenly at some remote date by a revolution or a general strike is that enthusiasm flags when there is nothing to do meanwhile, and no partial success to lessen the weariness of waiting. The only sort of movement which can succeed by such methods is one where the sentiment and the program are both very simple, {{as is the case in}} rebellions of oppressed nations. But the line of demarcation between capitalist and <b>wage-earner</b> is not sharp, like the line between Turk and Armenian, or between an Englishman and a native of India. Those who have advocated the social revolution have been mistaken in their political methods, chiefly because they have not realized how many people there are in the community whose sympathies and interests lie half on the side of capital, half on the side of labor. These people make a clear-cut revolutionary policy very difficult.|$|E
60|$|But, {{it will be}} said, as {{population}} increases, {{the price}} of food must ultimately increase also as the sources of supply in Canada, the Argentine, Australia and elsewhere {{are more and more}} used up. There must come a time, so pessimists will urge, when food becomes so dear that the ordinary <b>wage-earner</b> will have little surplus for expenditure upon other things. It may be admitted that this would be true in some very distant future if the population were to continue to increase without limit. If the whole surface of the world were as densely populated as London is now, it would, no doubt, require almost the whole labor of the population to produce the necessary food from the few spaces remaining for agriculture. But {{there is no reason to}} suppose that the population will continue to increase indefinitely, and in any case the prospect is so remote that it may be ignored in all practical considerations.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>wage-earners</b> {{are given}} three 'yes or no' {{questions}} {{about what they do}} in their spare time.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes--but I {{thought the}} other man might have some little trifle at stake in it, too; and even his wife and children, poor creatures. The masters are these: nobles, rich men, the prosperous generally. These few, who do no work, {{determine}} what pay the vast hive shall have who do work. You see? They're a 'combine'--a trade union, to coin a new phrase--who band themselves together to force their lowly brother to take what they choose to give. Thirteen hundred years hence--so says the unwritten law--the 'combine' will be the other way, and then how these fine people's posterity will fume and fret and grit their teeth over the insolent tyranny of trade unions! Yes, indeed! the magistrate will tranquilly arrange the wages from now clear away down into the nineteenth century; {{and then all of}} a sudden the <b>wage-earner</b> will consider that a couple of thousand years or so is enough of this one-sided sort of thing; and he will rise up and take a hand in fixing his wages himself. Ah, he will have a long and bitter account of wrong and humiliation to settle." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{it should}} be remarked in passing that this force upon a man to develop one feature {{has nothing to do}} with what is {{commonly}} called our competitive system, but would equally exist under any rationally conceivable kind of Collectivism. Unless the Socialists are frankly ready for a fall in the standard of violins, telescopes and electric lights, they must somehow create a moral demand on the individual that he shall keep up his present concentration on these things. It was only by men being in some degree specialist that there ever were any telescopes; they must certainly be in some degree specialist in order to keep them going. It is not by making a man a State <b>wage-earner</b> that you can prevent him thinking principally about the very difficult way he earns his wages. There is only one way to preserve in the world that high levity and that more leisurely outlook which fulfils the old vision of universalism. That is, to permit the existence of a partly protected half of humanity; a half which the harassing industrial demand troubles indeed, but only troubles indirectly. In other words, there must be in every center of humanity one human being upon a larger plan; one who does not [...] "give her best," [...] but gives her all.|$|E
60|$|The {{ideal of}} capitalism, {{if it could}} be achieved, would be to destroy {{competition}} among capitalists by means of Trusts, but to keep alive competition among workers. To some extent Trade Unionism has succeeded in diminishing competition among wage-earners within the advanced industrial countries; but it has only intensified the conflict between workers of different races, particularly between the white and yellow races.[92] Under the existing economic system, the competition of cheap Asiatic labour in America, Canada or Australia might well be harmful to white labour in those countries. But under Socialism an influx of industrious, skilled workers in sparsely populated countries would be an obvious gain to everybody. Under Socialism, the immigration of any person who produces more than he or she consumes will be a gain to every other individual in the community, since it increases the wealth per head. But under capitalism, owing to competition for jobs, a worker who either produces much or consumes little is the natural enemy of the others; thus the system makes for inefficient work, and creates an opposition between the general interest and the individual interest of the <b>wage-earner.</b> The case of yellow labour in America and the British Dominions {{is one of the most}} unfortunate instances of the artificial conflicts of interest produced by the capitalist system. This whole question of Asiatic immigration, which is liable to cause trouble for centuries to come, can only be radically solved by Socialism, since Socialism alone can bring the private interests of workers in this matter into harmony with the interests of their nation and of the world.|$|E

40|$|Precis: Factor-demand {{functions}} are estimated, for {{two types of}} labour (<b>wage-earners</b> and salaried-workers) and capital, for 40 manufacturing industries. Two sets of elasticity results are reported. The first set implicitly assumes Hicks-neutral technical change. The second set by including a time trend as an additional explanatory variable, relaxes this constraint. The magnitudes of the elasticity estimates are greater for the specification which includes the time trend. In the latter case, for those estimates which fulfil certain a priori requirements, the average own-elasticity of demand {{with respect to the}} cost of <b>wage-earners</b> was estimated to be - 0. 28. The elasticity of substitution between <b>wage-earners</b> and capital was generally less than one and greater than the corresponding elasticity between salaried-workers and capital...|$|R

60|$|Now, {{it is very}} {{important}} to understand here that there were two courses of action still open to the disappointed capitalist confronted by the new peril of this real or alleged decay. First, he might have reversed his machine, so to speak, and started unwinding the long rope of dependence by which he had originally dragged the proletarian to his feet. In other words, he might have seen that the workmen had more money, more leisure, more luxuries, more status in the community, and then trusted to the normal instincts of reasonably happy human beings to produce a generation better born, bred and cared for than these tortured types that were less and less use to him. It might still not be too late to rebuild the human house upon such an architectural plan that poverty might fly out of the window, with the reasonable prospect of love coming in at the door. In short, he might have let the English poor, the mass of whom were not weak-minded, though more of them were growing weaker, a reasonable chance, in the form of more money, of achieving their eugenical resurrection themselves. It has never been shown, and it cannot be shown, that the method would have failed. But it can be shown, and it must be closely and clearly noted, that the method had very strict limitations from the employers' own point of view. If they made the worker too comfortable, he would not work to increase another's comforts; if they made him too independent, he would not work like a dependent. If, for instance, his wages were so good that he could save out of them, he might cease to be a <b>wage-earner.</b> If his house or garden were his own, he might stand an economic siege in it. The whole capitalist experiment had been built on his dependence; but now it was getting out of hand, not in the direction of freedom, but of frank helplessness. One might say that his dependence had got independent of control.|$|E
60|$|It is {{customary}} {{among the}} apologists of Bolshevism in the West to excuse its harshness {{on the ground}} that it has been produced by the necessity of fighting the Entente and its mercenaries. Undoubtedly it is true that this necessity has produced many of the worst elements in the present state of affairs. Undoubtedly, also, the Entente has incurred a heavy load of guilt by its peevish and futile opposition. But the expectation of such opposition was always part of Bolshevik theory. A general hostility to the first Communist State was both foreseen and provoked by the doctrine of the class war. Those who adopt the Bolshevik standpoint must reckon with the embittered hostility of capitalist States; it is not worth while to adopt Bolshevik methods unless they can lead to good in spite of this hostility. To say that capitalists are wicked and we have no responsibility for their acts is unscientific; it is, in particular, contrary to the Marxian doctrine of economic determinism. The evils produced in Russia by the enmity of the Entente are therefore to be reckoned as essential in the Bolshevik method of transition to Communism, not as specially Russian. I am not sure that we cannot even go a step further. The exhaustion and misery caused by unsuccessful war were necessary {{to the success of the}} Bolsheviks; a prosperous population will not embark by such methods upon a fundamental economic reconstruction. One can imagine England becoming Bolshevik after an unsuccessful war involving the loss of India--no improbable contingency in the next few years. But at present the average <b>wage-earner</b> in England will not risk what he has for the doubtful gain of a revolution. A condition of widespread misery may, therefore, be taken as indispensable to the inauguration of Communism, unless, indeed, it were possible to establish Communism more or less peacefully, by methods which would not, even temporarily, destroy the economic life of the country. If the hopes which inspired Communism at the start, and which still inspire its Western advocates, are ever to be realized, the problem of minimizing violence in the transition must be faced. Unfortunately, violence is in itself delightful to most really vigorous revolutionaries, and they feel no interest in the problem of avoiding it as far as possible. Hatred of enemies is easier and more intense than love of friends. But from men who are more anxious to injure opponents than to benefit the world at large no great good is to be expected.|$|E
60|$|Where he {{gets his}} English is his own secret. There is nothing like it {{elsewhere}} in the earth; or even in paradise, perhaps, but the other place is probably full of it. You hire {{him as soon as}} you touch Indian soil; for no matter what your sex is, you cannot do without him. He is messenger, valet, chambermaid, table-waiter, lady's maid, courier--he is everything. He carries a coarse linen clothes-bag and a quilt; he sleeps on the stone floor outside your chamber door, and gets his meals you do not know where nor when; you only know that he is not fed on the premises, either when you are in a hotel or when you are a guest in a private house. His wages are large--from an Indian point of view--and he feeds and clothes himself out of them. We had three of him in two and a half months. The first one's rate was thirty rupees a month that is to say, twenty-seven cents a day; the rate of the others, Rs. 40 (40 rupees) a month. A princely sum; for the native switchman on a railway and the native servant in a private family get only Rs. 7 per month, and the farm-hand only 4. The two former feed and clothe themselves and their families on their $1.90 per month; but I cannot believe that the farmhand has to feed himself on his $1.08. I think the farm probably feeds him, and that the whole of his wages, except a trifle for the priest, go to the support of his family. That is, to the feeding of his family; for they live in a mud hut, hand-made, and, doubtless, rent-free, and they wear no clothes; at least, nothing more than a rag. And not much of a rag at that, {{in the case of the}} males. However, these are handsome times for the farm-hand; he was not always the child of luxury that he is now. The Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces, in a recent official utterance wherein he was rebuking a native deputation for complaining of hard times, reminded them that they could easily remember when a farm-hand's wages were only half a rupee (former value) a month--that is to say, less than a cent a day; nearly $2.90 a year. If such a <b>wage-earner</b> had a good deal of a family--and they all have that, for God is very good to these poor natives in some ways--he would save a profit of fifteen cents, clean and clear, out of his year's toil; I mean a frugal, thrifty person would, not one given to display and ostentation. And if he owed $13.50 and took good care of his health, he could pay it off in ninety years. Then he could hold up his head, and look his creditors in the face again.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to o¤er a logical genesis of the di¤erenci-ation of agents in two classes: {{capitalist}} entrepreneurs and <b>wage-earners.</b> The model presented here does not follow the Classical (or Marxian) tra-dition (where the two opposed classes are the straight consequence of theconcentration {{of the means of}} production {{in the hands of a}} limited fractionof people). It does not follow mainstream economists either (no di¤erenceaccording to general competitive equilibrium or a di¤erence taken as givenin labour economics in general). Models belonging to those traditions fail to reproduce a major stylisedfact: <b>wage-earners</b> cannot be distinguished from entrepreneurs when theyare in the market for ccommodities but they radically di¤er in the marketfor labouror in production (<b>wage-earners</b> do not produce for their ownaccount but for that of entrepreneurs who get prots, not wages). Modern tentatives to deal with the di¤erenciation of agents (Mat-suyama for instance) explain it by a progressive di¤erenciation of the levelof wealth up to a threshold which makes some agents able to accumulateand others not. We propose a di¤erent view based on the process of issuance of money. If a fraction of agents have not a direct access to that process they cannotact in the market for their own account. The alternatives they have arelimited to autarky or to work for the account of those who have addi-tional alternatives due to their direct access to money (to be independentproducers or entrepreneurs hiring <b>wage-earners).</b> The model makes explicit the necessary and su¢ cient conditions forthe existence of an E-equilibrium in which co-exist heterogeneous agents(entrepreneurs and <b>wage-earners)</b> starting from a population homogeneousexcept for bank rationing.
