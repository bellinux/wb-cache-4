40|$|Abstract: In {{this article}} I {{distinguish}} {{the notion of}} there being something <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be {{a certain kind of}} creature from that of there being something <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have a certain kind of experience. Work on consciousness has typically dealt with the latter while employing the language of the former. I propose several ways of analyzing what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be a certain kind of creature and find problems with them all. The upshot is that even if there <b>is</b> something <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have certain kinds of experience, it does not follow that there <b>is</b> anything <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be a certain kind of creature.

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to deepen}} knowledge whether caring and learning are an intertwined phenomenon in Dedicated Educational Units (DEU). The context is psychiatric and orthopaedic care, {{and the research}} is based on caring science. The research question is this: What characterizes the relationship between caring and learning in a DEU? This will be illuminated from three perspectives; the student, supervisor and patient perspectives. The question for the student is this: What <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> learn the nursing profession by caring for patients on a DEU? The question for the supervisor is this: What <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> supervise nursing students on a DEU? And the final question is directed at the patient: What <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cared for by nursing students in a DEU?

What <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> experience these emotions? Why, when, and how were they expressed? Drawing on diaries and sermons from seventeenth-century England, I show that the holy affections were often found to be the most exquisite of all human feelings – they saturated the body and soul, filling it with ‘heart melting sweetness’. Exploring these delightful experiences helps rebalance our picture of the emotional landscape of early modern Christian culture, which has traditionally concentrated on the gloomier passions of guilt, grief, and fear...|$|E

Using oral history as well as archival research, it provides an insight into children's wartime lives in which bombing often featured prominently, {{even though it has}} slipped out of French collective memory. How prepared were the French for this aerial onslaught? What <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> be bombed? And how did people understand why their 'friends' across the Channel were attacking them? Divided into three parts dealing with expectations, experiences and explanations of bombing, this book considers the child's view of wartime violence, analysing resilience, understanding and trauma. It contributes significantly to scholarship on civilian life in Occupied France, and will appeal to students, academics and general readers interested in the history of Vichy France, oral history and the experiences of children in war...|$|E

40|$|An {{interdisciplinary}} {{exploration of}} the sensory experiences invited and explored by textual and material products of the medieval period. What <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> experience the medieval world through one’s senses? Can we access those past sensory experiences, and use our senses to engage with the medieval world? How do texts, objects, spaces, manuscripts, and language itself explore, define, exploit, and control the senses of those who engage with them? This collection of essays seeks to explore these challenging questions. To do so is inevitably to take an interdisciplinary and context-focused approach. As a whole, this book develops understanding of how different fields speak to one another when they are focused on human experiences, whether of those who used our sources in the medieval period, or of {{those who seek to}} understand and to teach those sources today. Articles by leading researchers in their respective fields examine topics including: Old English terminology for the senses, effects of the digitisation of manuscripts on scholarship, Anglo-Saxon explorations of non-human senses, scribal sensory engagement with poetry, the control of sound in medieval drama, bird sounds and their implications for Anglo-Saxon sensory perception, how goldwork controls the viewing gaze, legalised sensory impairment, and the exploitation of the senses by poetry, architecture, and cult objects...|$|E
