40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Strategic {{recollection}} {{refers to}} control processes {{that allow the}} retrieval of information that is relevant for a specific situation. These processes can be studied in memory exclusion tasks, which require the retrieval of particular kinds of episodic information. In the current study, we investigated strategic recollection in reality monitoring by event-related potentials (ERPs). Participants studied object words, followed by {{a picture of the}} denoted object (perceive condition) or followed by the instruction to imagine such a picture (imagine condition). At test, subjects had to identify <b>words</b> <b>of</b> one study <b>condition</b> and to reject <b>words</b> <b>of</b> the second study condition together with newly presented items. Data analysis showed that object names were better identified when items <b>of</b> the perceive <b>condition</b> were targeted. In this test condition, a left parietal old/new effect (the ERP correlate of recollection) was observed only in response to targets. In contrast, both targets and nontargets elicited this old/new effect when items <b>of</b> the imagine <b>condition</b> were targeted. The magnitude of the left parietal old/new effect to nontargets in this condition (but no other left parietal old/new effect) correlated positively with the discrimination indices of both test condi- tions. In addition, ERPs to targets and nontargets differed at right frontal electrode sites at longer latencies (1500 – 1800 ms), with more positive ERPs for targets. Findings indicate that subjects retrieved nontarget information in the more difficult task condition, while they relied on target information alone in the less difficult task. This kind of strategic retrieval was not mirrored in other old/new effects. The correlation between the left parietal old/new effect for nontargets in the imagined item target condition and the discrimination indices <b>of</b> both <b>conditions</b> may indicate that the ease of nontarget retrieval, rather than the difficulty of target retrieval, increases the likelihood that nontarget information is actually retrieved...|$|R
40|$|The Canadian {{dangerous}} offender legislation {{seeks to}} identify the most dangerous offenders and to distinguish them from those who pose a lesser degree of risk. In 1997, a new designation was added: the long-term offender designation. The key difference between the dangerous offender and long-term offender is that the latter is deemed to be eventually controllable in the community. This dissertation was designed to describe and evaluate {{the application of the}} long-term offender provisions of the Canadian Criminal Code in the province of British Columbia during the first 10 years since its inception in 1997. The data sources include secondary file data and primary interview data. The files relating to 67 long-term offenders were accessed at the B. C. Forensic Psychiatric Services Commission; they contained both judicial reasons for judgment and expert assessments. The interviews were semi-structured and were conducted with a total of 33 interviewees in the following stakeholder categories: Legal, Mental Health, Supervision/Enforcement and Community Service. The file review findings reveal that long-term offenders are predominantly male and disproportionately Aboriginal. The index offences are primarily sexual in nature, and the 10 -year long-term supervision order length is the most commonly imposed. The most prevalent diagnoses are: substance-related disorder, antisocial personality disorder, and pedophilia. Ethnic differences in the diagnosis of psychopathy and in the evaluation of treatability are revealed. The interview findings reveal that a key advantage of the designation is that it provides a viable option that is less extreme than the dangerous offender designation, yet more restrictive than a conventional sentence. The lack of resources for effective supervision and treatment was noted by interviewees in each stakeholder category; the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> the long-term supervision order conditions was also described as problematic. Interviewees in each category indicate that there have been recent increases in the demands placed by this subset of the offender population. Suggestions for reform include improving the <b>wording</b> <b>of</b> the <b>conditions</b> <b>of</b> long-term supervision orders, increasing funding for treatment and supervision of long-term offenders, and also increasing agency collaboration and service continuity...|$|R

Doane {{planned to}} take his troop of {{soldiers}} over the Yellowstone plateau in early winter to begin the trip down the Snake River. With an ingeniously disassembled wooden boat on pack mules, Doane and his party traveled up the Yellowstone River from Fort Ellis eventually reaching Yellowstone Lake on October 24, well behind schedule because of deep snows and brutal cold. The boat proved difficult on Yellowstone Lake because of high winds and was partially wrecked and supplies were lost. The party {{did not get the}} boat to Heart Lake until November 7. The weather and cold were brutal and Doane's party did not make the next 20 miles down the Snake to Jackson Lake until December 7, 1876. By this time, they were critically short of supplies and began killing their stock for food. The boat proved unworthy in the Snake's whitewater and was eventually completely wrecked and abandoned. On December 15, 1876, Doane and his troop were near starvation and death when they arrived at a trapper's cabin on the Snake River. Eventually, they made Keenan City, Idaho and then Fort Hall, Idaho by January 4, 1877. By this time however, <b>word</b> <b>of</b> their <b>condition</b> had reached Major Brisbin at Fort Ellis and with permission from General Terry, Brisbin recalled Doane and his troops to Fort Ellis against Doane's wishes.

40|$|Recent {{language}} models, {{especially those}} based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), {{make it possible}} to generate natural language from a learned probability.

In many applications, we are likely to impose hard constraints on the generated texts, i. e., a particular word must appear in the sentence. Unfortunately, existing approaches could not solve this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel backward and forward language model. Provided a specific word, we use RNNs to generate previous words and future words, either simultaneously or asynchronously, resulting in two model variants. In this way, the given word could appear at any position in the sentence. Experimental results show that the generated texts are comparable to sequential LMs in quality...|$|R
