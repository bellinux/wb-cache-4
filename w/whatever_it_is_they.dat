2500|$|In David Gordon's dances, simple {{movement}} phrases are reiterated until {{what you}} notice {{is not the}} movement itself but the distinctiveness of {{the bodies of the}} performers. Gordon's genius lies both in his choice of dancers, most noticeably his wife and longtime collaborator Valda Setterfield, and in his gestural vocabulary. Also, his use of language underscores the message of his dances, which is that the body's actions and signals, like words, can change their meaning depending on their context. The phrasing of Gordon's movements is uninflected, fluid, tending to slide comfortably through the memory, so that what you want to pay attention to is the very manner in which these particular interesting figures do <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>they</b> are doing.

My father felt in devising the estate that, however interesting to the De Stancys those objects might be, they did not concern us--were indeed rather in the way, having been come by so strangely, through Mr. Wilkins, though too valuable to be treated lightly. Now I was going to suggest that we would not sell them--indeed I could not bear to do such a thing with what had belonged to Charlotte's forefathers--but to hand them over to her as a gift, either to keep for herself, or to pass on to her brother, as she should choose.

I need not be told that the hen is after all only step-mother to her ducklings, since I am contending that the civilized woman--the artificial product of our self-imposed conditions--cannot have the same relation to her offspring as the uncivilized woman really has to hers. The comparison, therefore, holds good, the mother with us being practically step-mother to children of another race; and if she is sensible, and amenable to nature's teaching, she will attribute their seemingly unsuitable ways and appetites to the right cause, and not to a hypothetical perversity or inherent depravity of heart, about which many authors will have spoken to her in many books: ...|$|E

In their exhaustive biography of Jim and Marian Jordan, historians Tom Price and Charles Stumpf describe the character of Luke; [...] "His favorite pastimes were whittling and pitching horseshoes, which he would rather do than tend to the store.

At the picnic the next day the king successfully eats a hot dog for a photo op, and Daisy, in a voiceover, states that the visit helped the two countries form a Special Relationship.

They saw rooms floored with boards that yawned apart and were splintered, skirtings eloquent of the industrious mouse, kitchens with a dead black-beetle in the empty cupboard, and a hideous variety of coal holes and dark cupboards under the stairs. They stuck their little heads through roof trap-doors and gazed at disorganised ball taps, at the bleak filthiness of unstoppered roofs.

Introduction: Among the {{questions}} that come to the busy, happy, sometimes heedless school-girl when, whether as preparatory student or more thoughtful graduate, she drops rules and ologies and smetries long enough to question of herself and her work “whither” and “why”, is one that was suggested when she finished the common school course and talked of going away to college. Devoted parents converse long before they finally decide that she can go. To give her up for four long years is hard. To send her away among strange people and new influences where home ties may be weakened and home-training defeated by the novel and charming life, is harder. But she must have more education than home schools can offer, and believing what the training of a college course will make her a better woman for her woman’s work, wherever, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>be,</b> <b>they</b> prepare to send her away; and she, timid, hopeful, thoughtful awaits the eventful week when her new life and her college education will begin...|$|R

Products consumed passively by members of different social classes are virtually all the same, with only superficial differences regarding to brand and genre.

Consumer tastes are being less influenced by traditional social structures, and they engage in play with free-floating signifiers to perpetually redefine themselves with <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> that <b>they</b> find pleasurable.|$|R
50|$|Rancière's book, The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons in Intellectual Emancipation (original title Le Maître ignorant: Cinq leçons sur l'émancipation intellectuelle, {{published}} in 1987) {{was written for}} educators and educators-to-be. Through the story of Joseph Jacotot, Rancière challenges his readers to consider equality {{as a starting point}} rather than a destination. In doing so, he asks educators to abandon the themes and rhetoric of cultural deficiency and salvation. Rather than requiring informed schoolmasters to guide students towards prescribed and alienating ends, Rancière argues that educators can channel the equal intelligence in all to facilitate their intellectual growth in virtually unlimited directions. The schoolmaster need not know anything (and may be ignorant). Rancière begins with the premises that all are of equal intelligence and that any collective educational exercise founded on this principle can provide the insights from which knowledge is constructed. He claims that the poor and disenfranchised should feel perfectly able to teach themselves <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>they</b> want to know. Furthermore, anyone can lead, and the oppressed should not feel bound to experts or reliant on others for their intellectual emancipation.|$|E

She seemed very much alarmed; she wept bitterly, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a long time before she regained her composure. She wanted to know whether they had confessed any thing. The protector's messengers would not tell her this, but they urged her to confess herself all that had occurred; for, <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>was,</b> <b>they</b> said that the evil and shame would all be ascribed to the other persons concerned, and not to her, on account of her youth and inexperience. But Elizabeth would confess nothing. The messengers went away, convinced, as they said, that she <b>was</b> guilty; <b>they</b> could see that in her countenance; and that her silence was owing to her firm determination not to betray her lover.
