30|$|The {{parameters}} {{used for}} the case study are given in Appendix B. In this section, a sensitivity analysis is conducted {{to gain a better}} understanding of which the configuration parameters have a critical impact on the accumulated heat energy. The simulations are based on the comparison of both the outlet temperature of the extracted fluids and the heat accumulated from the well calculated by Eq. (8). In the sensitivity analysis, one parameter is varied over a reasonable range, while the rest are kept at the defined values, as given in Table  2. The parameters chosen for the analysis are the density of <b>the</b> <b>working</b> fluids, <b>the</b> thermal conductivity of <b>the</b> <b>working</b> fluids, <b>the</b> specific heat capacity of <b>the</b> <b>working</b> fluids, <b>the</b> viscosity of <b>the</b> <b>working</b> fluids, <b>the</b> inlet temperature of <b>the</b> <b>working</b> fluids, <b>the</b> effect of insulation, and geostring diameter.|$|R

5|$|A {{large number}} of men were hired for the building's construction, and local workers were chosen over non-locals. During the construction, many of the workers lived in tents beside their worksite, and cooked meals and stayed there when not <b>working.</b> <b>The</b> {{cornerstone}} was laid on June 15, 1888; beneath it was laid several bottles of wine, {{a copy of a}} St. Helena Star and San Francisco newspapers, and foreign and rare coins. The building, called the Bourn & Wise Wine Cellar, was completed around June 1889, along with a distillery north of the building and a superintendent's house to the south. In September of that year Everett Wise became too ill to work and sold his share in the winery to Bourn, who between that time and 1890 named the winery Greystone Cellars.|$|E
5|$|According to Bayliss, the dog {{had been}} given a {{morphine}} injection earlier in the day, then was anaesthetized during the procedure with six fluid ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether (ACE), delivered from an ante-room to a tube in his trachea, via a pipe hidden behind the bench on which the men were <b>working.</b> <b>The</b> Swedish students disputed that {{the dog had}} been adequately anaesthetized. They said the dog had appeared conscious during the procedure, had tried to lift himself off the board, {{and that there was no}} smell of anaesthesia or the usual hissing sound of the apparatus. Other students said the dog had not struggled, but had merely twitched.|$|E
30|$|The {{internal}} stress of backfill material changes over three stages as <b>the</b> <b>working</b> face advances.

A local Partisan group arrives with a young German deserter, Hans Brundt, as their prisoner. Earlier, residents of the nearby village of Sant'Anna di Stazzema were killed by German forces following a betrayal by a partisan, named Rodolfo, who knows that Brundt can identify him as the traitor. After concealing the fact that German forces are approaching the village in a counterattack, Rodolfo kills Brundt and the Partisan leader before escaping. It is Rodolfo whom Negron will kill 39 years later. Captain Nokes arrives in the village to interrogate Brundt and finds him dead. The Americans prepare to leave the village ahead of a German counterattack, but Sam refuses to leave Angelo behind. After promising to court-martial all four soldiers, Nokes and his contingent drive out of town, but he is killed in the opening German offensive.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from overseas in 1921, Cooper {{got a job}} <b>working</b> <b>the</b> night shift at The New York Times. He was commissioned to write articles for Asia magazine. Cooper was able to travel with Ernest Schoedsack on a sea voyage on the Wisdom II. As part of the journey, he traveled to Abyssinia, or the Ethiopian Empire, where he met their prince regent, Ras Tefari, later known as Emperor Haile Selassie I. The ship left Abyssinia in February 1923. On their way home, the crew narrowly missed being attacked by pirates, and the ship was burned down. His three-part series for Asia was published in 1923.|$|E

Among the major proponents were Johan Conrad Ernst who built the Chancery Building or Kancellibygningen (1721) on Slotsholmen and Lauritz de Thurah who designed the Eremitage Palace (1734) in Dyrehaven, just north of Copenhagen.

5|$|Also in 1947, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) subpoenaed ten Hollywood {{directors}} and writers, the Hollywood Ten, intending {{to ask them}} to identify Communists, but the witnesses refused to testify. All were imprisoned for contempt of Congress. The ACLU supported the appeals of several of the artists, but lost on appeal. The Hollywood establishment panicked after the HUAC hearings, and created a blacklist which prohibited anyone with leftist associations from <b>working.</b> <b>The</b> ACLU supported legal challenges to the blacklist, but those challenges failed. The ACLU was more successful with an education effort; the 1952 report The Judges and the Judged, prepared at the ACLU's direction in response to the blacklisting of actress Jean Muir, described the unfair and unethical actions behind the blacklisting process, and it helped gradually turn public opinion against McCarthyism.|$|E
5|$|Before daybreak on February 15, 1916, between 100 and 300 Vietnamese {{wearing white}} headbands, white {{trousers}} and black tops, armed with sticks, farm implements and knives, sailed along the Arroyo Chinoise waterway and disembarked near {{the centre of}} Saigon. They had pretended to be <b>working</b> <b>the</b> transport industry, delivering fruit, vegetables and building materials.

5|$|Left undone, however, was {{extending}} the laws dealing with surveying and registering land claims with the registrar {{of the state}} land office. Cognizant that the old law would expire November 30, 1797, Garrard issued a proclamation on November 3 calling the legislature into special session. The legislators convened on November 28, and Garrard, drawing on {{his experience as a}} surveyor, addressed them regarding the urgency of adopting a new law and forestalling more lawsuits related to land claims, which were already numerous. Although a wealthy landowner himself, Garrard advocated protecting Kentucky's large debtor class from foreclosure on their lands. Garrard supported pro-squatting legislation, including measures that forbade the collection of taxes from squatters on profits they made from <b>working</b> <b>the</b> land they occupied and that required landowners to pay squatters for any improvements they made on their land. Despite opposition from some aristocratic legislators like John Breckinridge, most of the reforms advocated by Garrard were approved in the session.|$|E
