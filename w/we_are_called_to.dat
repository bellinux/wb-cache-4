25|$|Rosenzweig's major work is The Star of Redemption (first {{published}} in 1921). It is {{a description of}} the relationships between God, humanity, and the world, as they are connected by creation, revelation and redemption. If one makes a diagram with God at the top, and the World and the Self below, the inter-relationships generate a Star of David map. He is critical of any attempt to replace actual human existence with an ideal. In Rosenzweig's scheme, revelation arises not in metaphysics but in the here and now. <b>We</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> love God, and to do so is to return to the world, and that is redemption.|$|E

2500|$|Some Conservative Christians {{believe that}} the use of sex toys is immoral. The Southern Baptist preacher Dan Ireland has been an outspoken critic of such devices and has fought to ban them on {{religious}} and ethical grounds. Ireland has stated [...] "There are moral ways and immoral ways to use a firearm ... There is no moral way to use one of these devices." [...] According to Ireland, [...] "Sometimes you have to protect the public against themselves....These devices should be outlawed because they are conducive to promiscuity, because they promote loose morals and because they entice improper and potentially deadly behaviors." [...] On the other hand Heidi Johnson, a Lutheran Christian pastor, teaches that [...] "in the Christian tradition, <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> love God with all our heart, strength, mind, and soul...Sex toys are presented as a medium to engage in body love, self care, and exploring your sexuality as one of the ways we love God with all of our holistic being." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Tunnel Rats formed after rapper Dax Reynosa {{performed}} at a graffiti equipment store Hex's Hip Hop Shop. After the performance, he invited {{about two dozen}} rappers to his house for an open mic. The performers came from racially diverse backgrounds, a mix of Latinos, whites, and blacks, groups which Reynosa says did not always get along then. Among the standout performers that night were Reynosa's cousin Jurny Big, his sister Zane One, the four-member group Future Shock (consisting of Ahred a.k.a. Redbonz, Ajax Starglider, Sojourn, and DJ Trey-Qel), and Shames Worthy (a.k.a. Raphi), all of whom came together to form the Tunnel Rats. Reynosa was inspired to name the group [...] "Tunnel Rats" [...] after his father, {{who served in the}} Vietnam War as a tunnel rat. Ahred, a member of Future Shock, stated in an interview that [...] "We just put a name <b>to</b> it and <b>called</b> it Tunnel Rats.

That there does exist both order and harmony is undeniable; but we cannot see it.

6000|$|... "And the Lord God called," [...] &c. Here {{begins the}} {{conversion}} of Adam, from his sinful state, to God again. But mark, it begins not at Adam's calling upon God, but at God calling upon him: [...] "And the Lord God called unto Adam." [...] Wherefore, by these words, we are to understand the beginning of Adam's conversion. And indeed, grace hath gone {{the same way with}} the elect, from that time to this day. Thus he dealt with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; he called them from their native country, the country of their kindred. And hence it is, that, especially in the New Testament, the saints are said to be the Called; [...] "Called of God," [...] and [...] "Called of Jesus Christ." [...] And hence again it is that Calling is by Paul made the first demonstration of election, and that saints are admonished to prove their election by their calling; for as Adam was in a lost, miserable and perishing condition, until God called him out of those holes into which sin had driven him: so we do lie where sin and the devil hath laid us, until by the word of God <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ.|$|E
60|$|We had {{to observe}} in Johnson how much good a Prophet, under all {{disadvantages}} and disorganizations, can accomplish for the world. In Rousseau <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> look rather at the fearful amount of evil which, under such disorganization, may accompany the good. Historically it {{is a most}} pregnant spectacle, that of Rousseau. Banished into Paris garrets, in the gloomy company of his own Thoughts and Necessities there; driven from post to pillar; fretted, exasperated till the heart of him went mad, he had grown to feel deeply {{that the world was}} not his friend nor the world's law. It was expedient, if any way possible, that such a man should not have been set in flat hostility with the world. He could be cooped into garrets, laughed at as a maniac, left to starve like a wild beast in his cage;--but he could not be hindered from setting the world on fire. The French Revolution found its Evangelist in Rousseau. His semi-delirious speculations on the miseries of civilized life, the preferability of the savage to the civilized, and such like, helped well to produce a whole delirium in France generally. True, you may well ask, What could the world, the governors of the world, do with such a man? Difficult to say what the governors of the world could do with him! What he could do with them is unhappily clear enough,--guillotine a great many of them! Enough now of Rousseau.|$|E
60|$|You {{all know}} that this Sunday is called the First Sunday in Advent. You all know, I hope, that Advent means coming, and that these four Sundays before Christmas, as I have often told you, are called Advent Sundays, because upon them <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} the coming of our King and Saviour Jesus Christ. If you {{will look at the}} Collects, Epistles, and Gospels for these next four Sundays, you will see at once that they all bear upon our Lord's coming. The Gospels tell us of the prophecies about Christ which He fulfilled when He came. The Epistles tell us what sort of men we ought to be, both clergy and people, because He has come and will come again. The Collects pray that the Spirit of God would make us fit to live and die in a world into which Christ has come, and in which He is ruling now, and to which He will come again. The text which I have taken this morning, you just heard in this Sunday's Gospel. St. Matthew tells you that Jesus Christ fulfilled it by riding into Jerusalem in state upon an ass's colt; and St. Matthew surely speaks truth. Let us consider what the prophecy is, and how Jesus Christ fulfilled it. Then we shall see and believe from the Epistle what effect the knowledge of it ought to have upon our own souls, and hearts, and daily conduct.|$|E
6000|$|Returning homewards, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> a spot by the {{clapping}} of hands[FN#5] and {{the loud}} sound of song. We found {{a crowd of}} Badawin surrounding a group engaged in their favourite occupation of dancing. The performance is wild in the extreme, resembling rather the hopping of bears than the inspirations of Terpischore. The bystanders joined in the song; an interminable recitative, as usual, in the minor key, and—Orientals are admirable timists—it sounded like one voice. The refrain appeared to be— “La Yayha! La Yayha!” to which no one could assign a meaning. At other times they sang something intelligible. For instance:— [Arabic] That is to say,— ...|$|R
60|$|At last <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> table.

The landlady, her son, and the lass aforesaid, took the same. Our meal was quite a banquet by comparison. We had some beefsteak, not so tender as it might have been, some of the potatoes, some cheese, an extra glass of the swipes, and white sugar in our coffee.|$|R

6000|$|Now he was {{condemned}} of God's law, and died {{by the hand}} of justice, he was acquitted by God's law, and justified of justice; and all as a common person; so then, in his acquitting, we are acquitted, in his justification we are justified; and therefore the Apostle applieth God's justifying of Christ to himself; and that rightly (Isa 50:8, Rom 8:33,34). For if Christ be my undertaker, will stand in my place, and do for me, 'tis but reasonable that I should be a partaker: Wherefore we are also said to be [...] "quickened together with him" [...] (Eph 2:5): That is, when he was quickened in the grave; raised up together, and made to sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Therefore another scripture saith, [...] "Hath He quickened you--together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses" [...] (Col 2:13). This quickening, must not be understood of the renovation of our hearts, but of the restoring of Jesus Christ to life after he was crucified; and {{we are said to}} be quickened together with him, because we were quickened in him at his death, and were to fall or stand by him quite through the three days and three nights work; and were to take therefore our lot with him: Wherefore it is said again, That his resurrection is our justification (Rom 4:25). That by one offering he has purged our sins for ever (Heb 10:12); and that by his death he hath [...] "delivered us from the wrath to come" [...] (1 Thess 1:10). But I say, I would be understood aright: This life resideth yet in the Son, and is communicated from him to us, as <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> believe his word; mean while we are secured from wrath and hell, being justified in his justification, quickened in his quickening, raised up in his resurrection; and made to sit already together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus! 8 And is not this a glorious improvement of his death, that after two days the whole body of the elect, in him, should be revived, and that in the third day we should live in the sight of God, in and by him (Heb 6:18-20).|$|E
