I point out the <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> this book both inconsistently connects its chapters and establishes its intended audience, while clearly offering a balanced examination of the <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> gender-in-talk is often relevant but not omnipresent in conversations...|$|R

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I use rhetorical {{analysis and}} draw on articulation theory, primarily {{as it is}} conceived by Stuart Hall, to analyze the <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> LGBT social movements constitute and strategically deploy macro-level identities. This research focuses on the <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> movement identities [...] from the gay liberation of Stonewall through the current movements for marriage and military service [...] are rhetorically constructed. By tracking national LGBT social-movement organizations through such dynamic changes, my analyses reveal the <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> rearticulating {{the identity of a}} social movement can help groups change strategies and identifications when activist practices are failing. This scholarship adds to existing research on the <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> social movements constitute and reconstitute their shared sense of identity in the midst of evolving social contexts and also suggests some <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> multimodal rhetorics shape the development of movements...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine how a White teacher (Gina) responded to African American Language (AAL) in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> {{situated}} students as valuable members of a high school English classroom. This 5 -month qualitative study in a 10 th grade classroom drew from positioning theory and discourse analysis to make sense of classroom interactions with AAL. Findings show that although Gina was not fluent in AAL, she leveraged it in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> positioned students as members of the literacy community by doing the following: (a) opening opportunities for students to use AAL in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> contributed to the community, (b) not dismissing or ridiculing the use of AAL, and (c) maintaining a classroom of respect when AAL was used in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> disrespected that community. Implications from the study suggest that teaching high school English is not only about knowledge of content or best practices but also about leveraging multiple languages in <b>ways</b> <b>that</b> position students as participants of a literacy community.

Actor and writer Tom McCarthy aided Docter and Bob Peterson in shaping the story for about three months. Docter selected an old man for the main character after drawing a picture of a grumpy old man with smiling balloons. The two men thought that an old man was a good idea for a protagonist because they felt that their experiences and the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> they affect their view of the world was a rich source of humor. Docter was not concerned with an elderly protagonist, stating that children would relate to Carl in the <b>way</b> <b>that</b> they relate to their grandparents.|$|E
