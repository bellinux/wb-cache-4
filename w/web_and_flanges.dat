50|$|When {{examined}} by the driver and fireman, one of the cast iron girders of the bridge {{was found to have}} fractured, unusually, near to one of the abutments rather than at the centre of the beam. The track was supported by a pair of identical girders with Barlow rails cut to length laid across the inner flange, with asphalted ballast on top, just below the sleepers. When Captain Henry Whatley Tyler of the Railway Inspectorate examined the fracture surface, he found it rusted over, but the evidence of those who had seen it first, showed just what had happened. The cast iron girder had broken vertically from an enormous defect in the <b>web</b> <b>and</b> <b>flanges,</b> where there was a complete gap between the sides. The girder was completely defective here, but why no one had spotted it before the accident remains a mystery. Tyler suggests that it may have grown from an internal void with time, simply because such a defect would surely have been discovered either by the foundry or the builders. The girder had been installed 23 years before, in 1837, and should have supported a central load of 90 tons if in good condition. The pair of girders should have supported a total load of 360 tons distributed over all the structure, and Tyler stated that the girder was much bigger than was needed for the job. The engine weighed 31 tons and the tender 18 tons.|$|E

Using low wood-resin moisture content was found to interfere with the curing of the phenol–formaldehyde (PF) resin at the flange part resulting in poor quality beams.

40|$|Torsion is {{resisted}} well by locked {{system of}} reinforcement, {{due to the}} blood nature of the torsion induced-shear flow stresses in a beam. Therefore, {{it will be more}} effective to have strengthening schemes, which are wrapped in closed form around the cross section.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that Pultruded Fiber Reinforced Polymers joints suffer from the problem of {{transfer}} of high shear loads with bolted connections due to the low pin-bearing resistance of the material and to the elastic-brittle behavior which does not allow significant plastic redistribution of stresses between the different bolt rows. In order to overcome these issues, in this paper, the possibility to realize slip-critical connections with steel and PFRP plates is examined. Slip-critical connections, currently, are not allowed by national and international codes dealing with pultruded structures also due to the limited knowledge that has been achieved up to now by the scientific community. In fact, till now, few experiences are available and they only regard friction connections with all-PFRP elements.

40|$|Abstract: Double-bay or multi-bay {{portal frames}} of {{hot-rolled}} steel {{have been in}} existence since {{the development of the}} plastic analysis theory, and the behaviour of the eaves connections of these frames are well established. With the increasing use of cold-formed steel in portal frames, it is necessary to develop connecting structural systems that are favourable to these elements, and to understand the behaviour of these connections. The purpose of this investigation is to develop internal eaves connections of double-bay portal frames of cold-formed steel channels, with the main frames members connected back-to-back. In double-bay portal frames, the columns of two single-bay portal frames, positioned adjacent to each other, are replaced by one internal column. Two internal eaves connections were developed and investigated, and are referred in this paper as Eaves Connection Type 1 (ECT- 1) and Eaves Connection Type 2 (ECT- 2). Tests were then performed to determine the capacity and failure mechanism of these connections, including the members forming these connections. Although the failure mechanisms included local buckling of the compression zone of the <b>web</b> <b>and</b> <b>flange</b> of the channels, and bolt-bearing deformations, all frames finally failed by local buckling of the <b>web</b> <b>and</b> <b>flange</b> of the channels.

40|$|The local {{buckling}} capacity of fire exposed thin-walled steel cross sections {{is affected by}} the reduction in strength and stiffness due to elevated temperatures and the amplitude of the initial local imperfections. Several researchers have proposed design methods to calculate the capacity of the plates (i. e. <b>web</b> <b>and</b> <b>flanges)</b> that compose these steel members at elevated temperatures, but they used different shapes of steel plates (sides ratio a/b) and different amplitudes of local imperfections. This variability in hypotheses happens because there is no clear provision defining the numerical modeling procedure for fire design of steel plates in the codes (European or US). According to the theory of perfect plates, the critical load depends of the shape of the rectangular plate (e. g. the sides ratio a/b) and the corresponding buckling mode (number of half waves), the boundary and the loading conditions. This paper reviews the existing code provisions and compares the existing design models and their assumptions for thin-walled steel cross sections. Elements of the theory of perfect plates are presented. Parametric finite element analyses are then conducted on isolated steel plates at elevated temperatures to investigate the effect of the plate shape (a/b ratio) and imperfections (amplitude and number of half wave lengths). From the analysis, the governing parameter will be estimated (a/b vs imperfections) for simulation of isolated flanges and webs. Finally, recommendations for the numerical modeling of steel plates at elevated temperatures are proposed. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The {{strength}} of FRP composites in civil infrastructure applications is often {{considered to be}} a secondary consideration, as design is driven by stiffness criteria. However, the long-term performance of FRP in such applications is not well understood. Initially high factors of safety can be reduced by ply-level degradation and changes in failure mode caused by environmental aging and fatigue loading. FRP structures under transverse loading frequently fail by delamination at material or geometric discontinuities. The stress state at these discontinuities is complex and difficult to predict, and the critical stresses are very sensitive to loading, fiber architecture, and ply-level changes with time/exposure. Furthermore, the out-of-plane strength at a delamination site may also be affected by environmental aging. The present study considers several beam and sandwich type models to more accurately determine ply-level stresses that might lead to delamination at the ply level or at the web/flange interface of a structural beam. These models permit a relatively simple estimation of in-plane stresses which should be more accurate than those predicted using simple beam theory. They can capture such effects as load concentrations under point or patch loads, flange stresses due to web compression, and shear effects in both the <b>web</b> <b>and</b> <b>flanges.</b> Such models are advantageous as they permit analytic solutions, and they can be easily integrated into strength and life predictions which rely on iterative stress analyses and remaining strength calculations. The long-term objective of this work is to predict delamination failures in FRP thin-walled beams and sandwich beams under combined fatigue loading and environmental conditioning, using a simplified engineering approach. A more complete finite element model is also developed for verification. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{interest}} {{of the scientific community}} in obtaining the local buckling stresses for pultruded FRP (PFRP) shapes is shown by the huge number of published studies on this subject. The main objective of the present paper is to provide accurate estimates of the local buckling moment for PFRP beams. These estimates are fundamental for defining the nondimensional slenderness parameter introduced by the Italian Design Guide CNR DT 205 / 2007 [1] for beams in pure bending. One of the most technically sound formulations is that proposed by Kollár [2], who derived explicit expressions for the critical normal stresses of flange and web panels of PFRP beams that depend on the rotational stiffness of the web-flange junction in compression. This formulation is based on a consolidated approach for estimating the flange buckling strength of typical steel profiles [3]. In the present paper, a literature review is initially reported. In particular, it is shown that the approximate expression for the critical stress provided in [3] for steel members tends to underestimate the local buckling strength, {{especially in the case of}} wide-flange cross-section profiles. This underestimation becomes particularly evident for PFRP beams. For example, in [4], on the basis of the results of 10 bending tests, an average ratio of 1. 2 between experimental and predicted local buckling moments was obtained. Anyway, it has clearly been shown that the web-flange junctions play a crucial role in determining the buckling and ultimate strengths of PFRP beams [5]. Therefore, the experimental and numerical characterization of the junction behaviour is necessary [6]-[7]. The rotational spring stiffness used in Kollár’s model to reproduce the behaviour of the web-flange junction seems sensitive to the shear modulus of the flanges [4] and to the ratio Io,f/Io,w [8], with Io,f and Io,w being the ratios between transverse and longitudinal Young’s moduli for the <b>web</b> <b>and</b> <b>flanges,</b> respectively. Hence, in the present paper estimates of this stiffness based on a series of finite element buckling analysis results are finally reported. The influence of possible differences in the mechanical properties between flange and web panels is suitably taken into account...|$|E

As the manufacturing imperfections in the form of residual stresses {{play a significant role in}} determining the dynamic structural behavior of truck frame rail members, a careful assessment of residual stresses resulting from coiling-uncoiling and cold forming processes is needed. In the present investigation, non-linear Finite Element (FE) simulation of coiling-uncoiling and cold forming processes were carried out and the resulting residual stresses in frame rail corner, flat <b>web</b> <b>and</b> <b>flange</b> sections were compared with the experimentally measured residual stress values using X-ray diffraction technique.

40|$|Compression members, {{made from}} slender {{metallic}} plate elements, {{are prone to}} a wide range of different elastic instability phenomena. A thin-walled I-section strut, made from a linear elastic material, can suffer from the nonlinear interaction between a global (Euler) buckling mode, and a local flange plate buckling mode. The interactive buckling behaviour is usually much more unstable than when the modes are triggered individually and hence significantly reduces the load-carrying capacity of real struts. The current work focuses on such a problem using an analytical approach, the methodology of which has been well established in previous works on sandwich struts and I-section beams. An analytical model that describes the interactive buckling of a thin-walled I-section strut under pure compression based on variational principles is presented. Analytical formulations combining the Rayleigh–Ritz method and continuous displacement functions are presented to derive a series of systems that comprise differential and integral equilibrium equations for the structural component. Solving the systems of equations with numerical continuation reveals progressive cellular buckling (or snaking) arising from the nonlinear interaction between the weakly stable global buckling mode and the strongly stable local buckling mode. The resulting behaviour is highly unstable and when the model is extended to include geometric imperfections it compares excellently with some recently published experiments. Imperfection sensitivity studies reveal high sensitivity to both global and local imperfection types. The worst forms of local imperfection are identified in terms of the initial wavelength, amplitude and degree of localization. The effect of the varying rigidity of the joint of the section <b>web</b> <b>and</b> <b>flanges</b> is also studied and a rapid erosion of the cellular buckling response is revealed with increasing rigidity of the flange–web joint. A shell-based nonlinear finite element model is presented, primarily for validation purposes. The results from the analytical and finite element models show a good comparison, particularly for higher rigidities of the flange–web joint. A parametric study is conducted for two limiting cases, where the flange–web joint is assumed to be fully pinned or fully rigid. For a chosen set of geometries, the most undesirable interactive region is identified for both global and local slendernesses, in terms of the strut length and the flange width respectively. Practical implications are discussed in terms of the idealized buckling design curve. An analytical framework for the structural analysis of the thin-walled I-section struts that exhibit the nonlinear interaction of a global and a local buckling mode, including cellular buckling, has therefore been established.

Its <b>web,</b> inner <b>and</b> outer <b>flange</b> elements have different yield strengths due to varying levels of cold-working caused by their manufacturing process. Elevated temperature mechanical properties of LSBs {{are not the same}} even within their cross-sections. Therefore an experimental study was undertaken to determine the elevated temperature mechanical properties of steel plate elements in LSBs. Elevated temperature tensile tests were performed on <b>web,</b> inner <b>and</b> outer <b>flange</b> specimens taken from LSBs, and their results are presented in this paper including their comparisons with previous studies. Based on the test results and the proposed values from previous studies and fire design standards, suitable predictive equations are proposed for the determination of elevated temperature mechanical properties of LSB <b>web</b> <b>and</b> <b>flange</b> elements. Suitable stress–strain models are also proposed for the plate elements of this cold-formed <b>and</b> welded hollow <b>flange</b> channel section...|$|R

Although their failure mechanisms are the same, the flange connector does not cause eccentricity and two connectors at same buried depth can be used. On the other hand, flange connector in the manufacture and installation process is more economical applicability.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} coefficient {{method of analysis}} {{has been used to}} derive closed-form expressions for the mid-span deflection and end rotations of shear deformable uniform section beams with semi-rigid end connections. The formulae have been recast into performance indices which define the reduction in mid-span deflection, the increase in load carrying capacity and the increase in span relative to an otherwise identical simply supported beam for two practical load distributions: (1) a point load at mid-span and (2) a uniform load over the entire span. Expressions are also presented for the required rotation capacity of the semi-rigid end connections. Initial rotational stiffness data, derived from full-scale tests on <b>web</b> <b>and</b> <b>web</b> <b>and</b> <b>flange</b> cleat connections between two sizes of pultruded glass reinforced plastic (GRP) WF-section are used in the formulae to evaluate the performance indices for the practical range of span-to-depth ratios for load case (1). The values obtained quantify the benefits to be derived from exploiting semi-rigid end connection stiffness in the design of pultruded GRP beams with the current, very limited, range of section sizes...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} sample results of a finite element parametric study of hybrid rectangular links, involving over 200 combinations of geometries and properties. The parametric study {{is divided into two}} parts, the first part (Part 1) considers a wide range of compactnesses and link lengths to examine the difference in behavior between links satisfying and not satisfying, the proposed design requirements. The second part of the study (Part 2) involves models developed with <b>flange</b> compactness, <b>web</b> compactness, <b>and</b> stiffener spacings near the revised design limits, and also examines links having <b>webs</b> <b>and</b> <b>flanges</b> with different yield stresses (hybrid links). Links meeting the proposed design requirements were, in general, found to be able to achieve their target rotations prior to significant strength degradation from web or flange buckling...|$|R
