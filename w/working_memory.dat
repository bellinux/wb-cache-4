5|$|A {{study by}} Sanchez and Wiley showed that seductive details caused poor {{learning}} outcomes because they take {{up some of}} the limited space in <b>working</b> <b>memory.</b> The experiment compared people's ability to control their attention to scientific text that contained either seductive images, relevant images, or no images. The study showed that people with low <b>working</b> <b>memory</b> capacity were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect. Sanchez and Wiley also did an experiment where eye-tracking was monitored to evaluate how people were reading the same seductively illustrated scientific text. The results showed that people with low <b>working</b> <b>memory</b> looked at the seductive illustrations more often and for longer than those with high <b>working</b> <b>memory</b> capacity. It could be argued that differences in performance between high- and low- <b>working</b> <b>memory</b> capacity individuals is really due to general reading ability, an attribute that has been correlated with <b>working</b> <b>memory</b> capacity in other studies.|$|E
5|$|This {{vulnerability}} as {{it relates}} to low <b>working</b> <b>memory</b> capacity individuals and seductive details within textual information can also be seen as a difference between children and adult learners. Because adults, on average, having a higher <b>working</b> <b>memory</b> capacity than children, adults are less affected by seductive details than children.|$|E
5|$|Another related form of {{experiment}} is the double-task experiment, {{in which a}} subject must perform an extra task (such as sequential finger-tapping or articulating nonsense syllables) while responding to linguistic stimuli; this kind {{of experiment}} {{has been used to}} investigate the use of <b>working</b> <b>memory</b> in language processing.|$|E

40|$|Space {{perception}} provides egocentric, oriented {{views of}} the environment from which <b>working</b> and long-term <b>memories</b> are constructed. "Allocentric" (i. e. position-independent) long-term memories may be organized as graphs of recognized places or views but the interaction of such cognitive graphs with egocentric <b>working</b> <b>memories</b> is unclear. Here we present a simple coherent model of view-based <b>working</b> and long-term <b>memories,</b> together with supporting evidence from behavioral experiments. The model predicts (i) that within a given place, memories for some views may be more salient than others, (ii) that imagery of a target square should depend on the location where the recall takes place, and (iii) that recall favors {{views of the}} target square that would be obtained when approaching it from the current recall location. In two separate experiments in an outdoor urban environment, pedestrians were approached at various interview locations and asked to draw sketch maps of one of two well-known squares. Orientations of the sketch map productions depended significantly on distance {{and direction of the}} interview location from the target square, i. e. different views were recalled at different locations. Further analysis showed that location-dependent recall is related to the respective approach direction when imagining a walk from the interview location to the target square. The results are consistent with a view-based model of spatial long-term and <b>working</b> <b>memories</b> and their interplay...|$|R
5|$|The {{prefrontal cortex}} plays a {{significant}} role in mediating executive functions. Neuroimaging during neuropsychological tests of executive function, such as the stroop test and <b>working</b> <b>memory</b> tests, have found that cortical maturation of the prefrontal cortex correlates with executive function in children. Planning involves activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), anterior cingulate cortex, angular prefrontal cortex, right prefrontal cortex, and supramarginal gyrus. <b>Working</b> <b>memory</b> manipulation involves the DLPFC, inferior frontal gyrus, and areas of the parietal cortex. Inhibitory control involves multiple areas of the prefrontal cortex as well as the caudate nucleus and subthalamic nucleus.In conditions in which prepotent responses tend to dominate behavior, such as in drug addiction, where drug cues can elicit drug seeking (Chapter 15), or in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; described below), significant negative consequences can result.... ADHD can be conceptualized as a disorder of executive function; specifically, ADHD is characterized by reduced ability to exert and maintain cognitive control of behavior. Compared with healthy individuals, those with ADHD have diminished ability to suppress inappropriate prepotent responses to stimuli (impaired response inhibition) and diminished ability to inhibit responses to irrelevant stimuli (impaired interference suppression).... Functional neuroimaging in humans demonstrates activation of the prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus (part of the striatum) in tasks that demand inhibitory control of behavior.... Early results with structural MRI show thinning of the cerebral cortex in ADHD subjects compared with age-matched controls in prefrontal cortex and posterior parietal cortex, areas involved in <b>working</b> <b>memory</b> and attention.}} Task shifting doesn't involve specific regions of the brain, but instead involves multiple regions of the prefrontal cortex and parietal lobe.|$|E
5|$|<b>Working</b> <b>memory</b> is {{the ability}} of the brain to {{maintain}} a temporary representation of information about the task that an animal is currently engaged in. This sort of dynamic memory is thought to be mediated by the formation of cell assemblies—groups of activated neurons that maintain their activity by constantly stimulating one another.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{evidence}} that cognitive deficits remain stable over time is reliable and abundant, {{much of the research}} in this domain focuses on methods to improve attention and <b>working</b> <b>memory.</b> Efforts to improve learning ability in individuals with schizophrenia using a high- versus low-reward condition and an instruction-absent or instruction-present condition revealed that increasing reward leads to poorer performance while providing instruction leads to improved performance, highlighting that some treatments may exist to increase cognitive performance. Training individuals with schizophrenia to alter their thinking, attention, and language behaviors by verbalizing tasks, engaging in cognitive rehearsal, giving self-instructions, giving coping statements to the self to handle failure, and providing self-reinforcement for success, significantly improves performance on recall tasks. This type of training, known as self-instructional (SI) training, produced benefits such as lower number of nonsense verbalizations and improved recall while distracted.|$|E

50|$|The need {{to reduce}} {{complexity}} is mainly driven by limited ability of most people to hold complex structures and information in their <b>working</b> <b>memories.</b> Reduced complexity is achieved through emphasizing the creation of code that is simple and readable rather than clever. Minimizing complexity is accomplished through making use of standards, and through numerous specific techniques in coding. It is also supported by the construction-focused quality techniques.|$|R
5|$|Cognitive {{disturbances}} {{can occur}} {{in the early stages}} of the disease and sometimes prior to diagnosis, and increase in prevalence with duration of the disease. The most common cognitive deficit in PD is executive dysfunction, which can include problems with planning, cognitive flexibility, abstract thinking, rule acquisition, inhibiting inappropriate actions, initiating appropriate actions, <b>working</b> <b>memory,</b> and control of attention. Other cognitive difficulties include slowed cognitive processing speed, impaired recall and impaired perception and estimation of time. Nevertheless, improvement appears when recall is aided by cues. Visuospatial difficulties are also part of the disease, seen for example when the individual is asked to perform tests of facial recognition and perception of the orientation of drawn lines. A person with PD has two to six times the risk of dementia compared to the general population.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive {{flexibility}} and other executive function skills {{are crucial to}} success both in classroom settings and life. A study examining the impact of cognitive intervention for at-risk children in preschool classrooms found that children who received such intervention for {{one to two years}} significantly outperformed their peers. Compared to same-age children who were randomly assigned to the control condition (a literacy unit developed by the school district), preschoolers who received intervention achieved accuracy scores of 85% on tests of inhibitory control (self-discipline), cognitive flexibility, and <b>working</b> <b>memory.</b> Their peers in the control (no intervention) condition, on the other hand, demonstrated only 65% accuracy. Educators involved in this study ultimately opted to implement the cognitive skills training techniques instead of the district-developed curriculum.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{enlargement}} of the primate brain comes from a massive expansion of the cerebral cortex, especially the prefrontal cortex and {{the parts of the}} cortex involved in vision. The visual processing network of primates includes at least 30 distinguishable brain areas, with a complex web of interconnections. It has been estimated that visual processing areas occupy {{more than half of the}} total surface of the primate neocortex. The prefrontal cortex carries out functions that include planning, <b>working</b> <b>memory,</b> motivation, attention, and executive control. It takes up a much larger proportion of the brain for primates than for other species, and an especially large fraction of the human brain.|$|E
40|$|How {{does the}} brain extract {{invariant}} properties of variable-rate speech? A neural model, called PHONET, is developed to explain {{aspects of this}} process and, along the way, data about perceptual context effects. For example, in consonant vowel (CV) syllables such as /ba/ and /wa/, {{an increase in the}} duration of the vowel can cause a switch in the percept of the preceding consonant from /w/ to /b/ (Miller and Liberman, 1979). The frequency extent of the initial formant transitions of fixed duration also influences the percept (Schwab, Sawusch, and Nusbaum, 1981). PHONET quantitatively simulates over 98 % of the variance in these data using a single set of parameters. The model also qualitatively explains many data about other perceptual context effects. In the model, C and V inputs are filtered by parallel auditory streams that respond preferentially to transient and sustained properties of the acoustic signal before being stored in parallel <b>working</b> <b>memories.</b> A lateral inhibitory network of onset- and rate-sensitive cells in the transient channel extracts measures of frequency transition rate and extent. Greater activation of the transient stream can increase the processing rate in the sustained stream via a cross-stream automatic gain control interaction. The stored activities across these gain-controlled <b>working</b> <b>memories</b> provide a basis for rate-invariant perception, since the transient-to-sustained gain control tends to preserve the relative activities across the transient and sustained <b>working</b> <b>memories</b> as speech rate changes. Comparisons with alternative models tested suggest the fit can not be attributed to the simplicity of the data. Brain analogs of model cell types are described.

5|$|Researchers {{focus on}} {{various aspects of}} {{cognitive}} theory to explain the seductive details effect. Seductive details impose an extraneous cognitive load during learning by enticing students to spend their limited resources in processing materials that distract from, or disrupt, {{the construction of a}} coherent mental model in the learning process. Most studies use seductive details in science text to demonstrate the extraneous cognitive load. However, there are contrasting studies done with non-scientific texts that did not produce the same results. These results may suggest that seductive details can only interfere with learning within a high load learning process that requires managing the available cognitive resources. In learning situations that are associated with low <b>working</b> <b>memory</b> activity, seductive details did not have a detrimental effect. They can even lead to higher performance because there are the required cognitive resources available for the motivating function.|$|E
5|$|The {{executive}} {{function of the}} brain is the set of cognitive processes that allow the cognitive control of behavior: selecting and successfully monitoring behaviors that facilitate the attainment of chosen goals. Executive functions include the ability to filter information and tune out irrelevant stimuli with attentional control and cognitive inhibition, the ability to process and manipulate information held in <b>working</b> <b>memory,</b> {{the ability to think}} about multiple concepts simultaneously and switch tasks with cognitive flexibility, the ability to inhibit impulses and prepotent responses with inhibitory control, and the ability to determine the relevance of information or appropriateness of an action. Higher order {{executive function}}s, require multiple cognitive processes including planning, reasoning, and problem solving.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{the theory}} of {{inhibitory}} control has been offered to account for decline seen in <b>working</b> <b>memory.</b> This theory examines the idea that older adults are unable to suppress irrelevant information in <b>working</b> <b>memory,</b> and thus the capacity for relevant information is subsequently limited. Less space for new stimuli due may attribute to the declines seen in an individual's <b>working</b> <b>memory</b> as they age.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the differential effects of learning task complexity on both learning process and outcome efficiency of 83 individual and group learners {{in the domain of}} biology. Based upon cognitive load theory, it was expected that for high-complexity tasks, group members would learn in a more efficient way than individual learners, while for low-complexity tasks, individual learning would be more efficient. This interaction hypothesis was confirmed, supporting our premise that the learning efficiency of group members and individuals is determined by a trade-off between the group’s advantage of dividing information processing amongst the collective <b>working</b> <b>memories</b> of the group members and its disadvantage in terms of associated costs of information communication and action coordination...|$|R

30|$|Remanence {{memories}} are rather small for our samples if memory {{is taken to}} be strictly the recovery of remanence between the monoclinic and cubic phase on the second passage of TV.

Additionally, participants increasingly remembered objects as lines with similar orientations and lengths, consistent with the Gestalt grouping principles of continuity and similarity. Furthermore, the increasing tendency of participants to remember objects as components of hierarchically organized lines rather than individual objects or clusters suggests that these priors aid the perception of higher-level structures from ensemble statistics...|$|R
