25|$|I {{knew the}} Englishmen would test me {{out as soon}} as I walked out. Ian Botham. Bob Willis. I {{remember}} facing Ian Botham <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> there, and he did test me out. Fortunately enough I did hook him for a six, but I must admit {{it was more of a}} top edge. Adelaide Oval had quite short square boundaries, and it managed to clear them for a six. Of course he tested me out a few more times.|$|E
25|$|The {{man in the}} {{wheelchair}} says he too once {{had the support of}} a woman “to get me out of the chair in the evening and back into it again in the morning and to push me as far as the corner <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> of my mind.” He also had a son, Billy, and begins calling the blind man by that name. He proposes the two of them join forces to unite sight and mobility in the interests of survival. The blind man is tempted by the other’s offer to locate some tinned food. The prospect of chancing across some “baked beans” especially excites him.|$|E
500|$|Leopold's physician-in-ordinary, Christian Stockmar (later, as Baron Stockmar, {{advisor to}} both Queen Victoria and Prince Albert), wrote {{that in the}} first six months of the marriage, he had never seen Charlotte wear {{anything}} that was not simple and in good taste. [...] He also noted that she was much more calm and in control of herself than she used to be, and attributed this to Leopold's influence. [...] Leopold wrote later, [...] "Except <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> to shoot, we were together always, and we could be together, we did not tire." [...] When Charlotte became too excited, Leopold would say only, [...] "Doucement, chėrie" [...] ("Gently, my love"). [...] Charlotte both accepted the correction and began calling her husband [...] "Doucement".|$|E

60|$|I {{think he}} swore, I am sure he groaned distressfully <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> {{with what was}} due to me. Meeting Harry I told him the story.|$|E

6000|$|... 'There was a {{gleam of}} {{sunshine}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> {{got out of}} the van yesterday. I never knew before what sunshine was. I hope it will be a sunny day <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> for the last time!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's trite!' said Leonard, {{patting her}} fondly. 'I {{like you to}} do--as you call it--Miss May does, and every one that is worth anything. <b>I</b> say, Ave, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> to the islands, you are coming too?' ...|$|R
60|$|Twelve days passed, and {{one morning}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> {{to feed the}} chickens, I saw the red Kaffir with the scar on his face seated beyond the stoep taking snuff.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I'm dead broke," [...] Carrots replied, mournfully. [...] "I {{spent some}} of my money <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> with the farmer, an' {{the rest of it}} while I was walkin' in yesterday." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> {{into the}} front yard I found Mr. Poplington and Jone sitting on a little stone bench, for they was tired, and I told them about that young woman and Davy.|$|E
50|$|Death follows me {{and life}} escapes me. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> to sleep, <b>I</b> think that I may never awake. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> wake up, I think that I {{may never get}} to sleep. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out,</b> <b>I</b> think that I may never come back.|$|R

60|$|I was a {{free man}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> of the Court; but I was a beggar--I, Captain Stubbs, of the bold North Bungays, {{did not know where}} I could get a bed, or a dinner.|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't believe it," [...] the {{man said}} huskily. [...] "Just to think! <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> this morning there was Jane and the kids, as well and as happy as ever, and there, where are they now?" ...|$|E

60|$|I {{am in the}} Law, but not of it. I can't exactly {{make out}} what it means. I sit in Westminster Hall {{sometimes}} (in character) from ten to four; and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out</b> of Court, <b>I</b> don't know whether I am standing on my wig or my boots.|$|R

[...] He likes to warm up for games listening to Napalm Death.|$|R
60|$|I don't {{know how}} {{the rest of the night}} passed. I only find my memory again when the morning came, and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> by myself to breathe the crisp wintry air on the open moor behind the inn.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] Jim replied, [...] "we {{might get}} one of the big boats through it now; but it's going to be worse, presently. <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> last year, with a boat to the brig which was driven ashore, it was worse than this.|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know what}} kept me awake so late that night. As a {{consequence}} I overslept myself. I {{had managed to}} redeem my reputation on this point, but here it was lost again. I felt cross and foolish and cantankerous <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll go {{anywhere}} {{so long as}} I {{can get out of}} this beastly country,' he answered wearily.

60|$|He {{was sitting}} on deck <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> and his missis too, but neither of 'em spoke a word. I picked up my broom and went on sweeping, when {{suddenly}} I 'eard a voice at the gate I thought I knew, and in came my wife.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, an' {{the way he}} shot it too," [...] {{said the}} seaman, laying aside his rifle, [...] "would have made even a monkey stare with astonishment. Has Leather come back, by the way?

60|$|None {{of us was}} talkative that evening, but fervent good wishes {{followed}} me <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out</b> with the east-bound train the next day, and until the dusky pines hid her, closing round the track, I saw cousin Alice's slight figure with her face turned toward the departing train.|$|E
5000|$|In 1993, Walker {{opened for}} George Strait and Alan Jackson and he stated in an {{interview}} with Billboard [...] "I'm real grateful for the opportunity to open for those guys," [...] with only one hit record, it's hard to keep the audience's attention for 45 minutes, but it's working.

60|$|<b>When</b> {{presently}} <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>out,</b> Effie {{was working}} with an extraordinary appearance of calm--and there was no look for me at all....|$|R
60|$|The prison {{style is}} {{absolutely}} and entirely wrong. I would {{give anything to}} be able to alter it <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>out.</b> <b>I</b> intend to try. But {{there is nothing in the}} world so wrong but that the spirit of humanity, which is the spirit of love, the spirit of the Christ who is not in churches, may make it, if not right, at least possible to be borne without too much bitterness of heart.|$|R
