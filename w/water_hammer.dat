25|$|It was <b>water</b> <b>hammer</b> {{that caused}} the {{physical}} damage to the reactor, the deaths of personnel who stood atop and nearby, {{and the release of}} radioactive isotopes to the environment. One of the lessons learned from SL-1 was that there is an extreme <b>water</b> <b>hammer</b> hazard whenever a shutdown reactor is cooled to room temperature and there is an air gap between the top of the water and the reactor vessel head. One of the recommendations in the analysis of the incident was that shutdown reactors be filled to the top with water so that a power excursion could not induce such a powerful <b>water</b> <b>hammer.</b> Air is not dense enough to appreciably slow water, while water (being nearly incompressible) is able to distribute explosive forces and limit peak pressure. The extra water is also a very effective radiation shield for those who are directly above the vessel. Written procedures at SL-1 had included a directive to pump down the level of water in the reactor prior to the maintenance procedure that destroyed it.|$|E
25|$|The valvular {{event that}} causes such {{cavitating}} conditions to exist is the closing {{mechanics of the}} MHV. Several causes of cavitation relating to valve closure have been identified. Squeeze flow is cavitation that is said to occur as the occluder approaches the housing during closure and fluid is squeezed between the occluder and the valve housing causing a low pressure formation. <b>Water</b> <b>hammer</b> is cavitation caused by the sudden stop of the valve occluder as it contacts the valve housing. This sudden retardation of the fluid retrograde inertia is said to put the fluid under tension causing cavitation. Squeeze flow is said to form a cloud of bubbles at the circumferential lip of the occluder whereas <b>water</b> <b>hammer</b> {{is said to be}} seen as transient bubbles at the occlude housing.|$|E
25|$|Liquids {{have little}} {{compress}}ibility. Water, for example, will compress by only 46.4 {{parts per million}} for every unit increase in atmospheric pressure (bar). At around 4000 bar (58,000 psi) of pressure, at room temperature, water only experiences an 11% decrease in volume. In the study of fluid dynamics, liquids are often treated as incompressible, especially when studying incompressible flow. This incompressible nature makes a liquid suitable for transmitting hydraulic power, because {{very little of the}} energy is lost in the form of compression. However, the very slight compressibility does lead to other phenomena. The banging of pipes, called <b>water</b> <b>hammer,</b> occurs when a valve is suddenly closed, creating a huge pressure-spike at the valve that travels backward through the system at just under the speed of sound. Another phenomenon caused by liquid's incompressibility is cavitation. Because liquids have little elasticity they can literally be pulled apart in areas of high turbulence or a dramatic change in direction, such as the trailing edge of a boat propeller or a sharp corner in a pipe. A liquid in an area of low pressure (vacuum) vaporizes and forms bubbles, which then collapse as they enter high pressure areas. This causes liquid to fill the cavities left by the bubbles with tremendous localized force, eroding any adjacent solid surface.|$|E

2500|$|On January 3, 1961, {{the reactor}} was being {{prepared}} for restart after a shutdown of eleven days over the holidays. Maintenance procedures required that the main central control rod be manually withdrawn a few inches to reconnect it to its drive mechanism. At 9:01p.m., this rod was suddenly withdrawn too far, causing SL-1 to go prompt critical instantly. In four milliseconds, the heat generated by the resulting enormous power excursion caused water surrounding the core to begin to explosively vaporize. The water vapor caused a pressure wave to strike {{the top of the}} reactor vessel, causing water and steam to spray {{from the top of the}} vessel. This extreme form of <b>water</b> <b>hammer</b> propelled control rods, shield plugs, and the entire reactor vessel upward. A later investigation concluded that the [...] vessel had jumped [...] and the upper control rod drive mechanisms had struck the ceiling of the reactor building prior to settling back into its original location. The spray of water and steam knocked two operators onto the floor, killing one and severely injuring another. One of the shield plugs on top of the reactor vessel impaled the third man through his groin and exited his shoulder, pinning him to the ceiling. The victims were Army Specialists John A. Byrnes (age 27) and Richard Leroy McKinley (age 22), and Navy Seabee Construction Electrician First Class (CE1) Richard C. Legg (age 26). It was later established that Byrnes (the reactor operator) had lifted the rod and caused the excursion, Legg (the shift supervisor) was standing on top of the reactor vessel and was impaled and pinned to the ceiling, and McKinley, the trainee who stood nearby, was later found alive by rescuers. All three men succumbed to injuries from physical trauma; however, the radiation from the nuclear excursion would have given the men no chance of survival even if they had not been killed by the explosion stemming from the criticality accident.|$|E
60|$|Of {{course the}} coral polypes cannot build above the high-tide mark; but the surf which beats upon them piles up their broken {{fragments}} {{just as a}} sea-beach is piled up, and hammers them together with that <b>water</b> <b>hammer</b> which is heavier and stronger than any you have ever seen in a smith's forge. And then, as is the fashion of lime, the whole mass sets and becomes hard, as you may see mortar set; {{and so you have}} a low island a few feet above the sea. Then sea-birds come to it, and rest and build; and seeds are floated thither from far lands; and among them almost always the cocoa-nut, which loves to grow by the sea-shore, and groves of cocoa palms grow up upon the lonely isle. Then, perhaps, trees and bushes are drifted thither before the trade-wind; and entangled in their roots are seeds of other plants, and eggs or cocoons of insects; and so a few flowers and a few butterflies and beetles set up for themselves upon the new land. And then a bird or two, caught in a storm and blown away to sea finds shelter in the cocoa-grove; and so a little new world is set up, in which (you must remember always) there are no four-footed beasts, nor snakes, nor lizards, nor frogs, nor any animals that cannot cross the sea. And on some of those islands they may live (indeed {{there is reason to believe}} they have lived), so long, that some of them have changed their forms, according to the laws of Madam How, who sooner or later fits each thing exactly for the place in which it is meant to live, till upon some of them you may find such strange and unique creatures as the famous cocoa-nut crab, which learned men call Birgus latro. A great crab he is, who walks upon the tips of his toes a foot high above the ground. And because he has often nothing to eat but cocoa-nuts, or at least they are the best things he can find, cocoa-nuts he has learned to eat, and after a fashion which it would puzzle you to imitate. Some say that he climbs up the stems of the cocoa-nut trees, and pulls the fruit down for himself; but that, it seems, he does not usually do. What he does is this: when he finds a fallen cocoa-nut, he begins tearing away the thick husk and fibre with his strong claws; and he knows perfectly well which end to tear it from, namely, from the end where the three eye-holes are, which you call the monkey's face, out of one of which you know, the young cocoa-nut tree would burst forth. And when he has got to the eye-holes, he hammers through one of them with the point of his heavy claw. So far, so good: but how is he to get the meat out? He cannot put his claw in. He has no proboscis like a butterfly to insert and suck with. He is as far off from his dinner as the fox was when the stork offered him a feast in a long-necked jar. What then do you think he does? He turns himself round, puts in a pair of his hind pincers, which are very slender, and with them scoops the meat out of the cocoa-nut, and so puts his dinner into his mouth with his hind feet. And even the cocoa-nut husk he does not waste; for he lives in deep burrows which he makes like a rabbit; and being a luxurious crab, and liking to sleep soft in spite of his hard shell, he lines them with a quantity of cocoa-nut fibre, picked out clean and fine, just as if he was going to make cocoa-nut matting of it. And being also a clean crab, as I hope you are a clean little boy, he goes down to the sea every night to have his bath and moisten his gills, and so lives happy all his days, and gets so fat in his old age that he carries about his body nearly a quart of pure oil.|$|E

40|$|A survey covers {{pressure}} shocks or <b>water</b> <b>hammers</b> and cavitation impacts in piping systems, events that increasingly occur, {{and the reasons}} for their occurrence and their effects on the piping. The application and limits of simplified formulas that under certain conditions make it possible to estimate such possible impacts are presented. Three examples indicate which measures to take to avoid {{pressure shocks}} or <b>water</b> <b>hammers</b> and cavitation impacts in piping systems. The discussion includes introduction; reasons and effects for pressure shocks and cavitation; empirical formulas, their use and limits; consideration of the risks and measures to avoid them; and a passive safety system. In cooperation with the Ebro Armaturen company, the Fraunhofer Institut Umsicht has developed and patented the Pressure Control Device (PCD). This is a reliable, easily installed, and passive safety system (no additional auxiliary energy involved). On a standard drive the PCD with force lockin g closure or control fitting contains an inner hydraulic circuit that is placed in motion by a signal from the control element. At the same time the PCD is effectively hydraulically connected to the main line. When the pressure in the main line piping reaches an undue value, such that the hydraulic circulation or cycle in the PCD is stopped, further closing of the fitting is hindered until the pressure in the main pipeline again drops. In every instance the fitting closes - failsafe - through an inner bypass in the PCD with preset time constants. The first example relates to a long pipe carrying liquids in which <b>water</b> <b>hammers</b> and cavitation blows arise form opening and closing the fittings. The second example also relates to a long pipe carrying liquids where <b>water</b> <b>hammers</b> and cavitation blows occur from the startup and shutdown of high performance pumps.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the problem of {{friction}} during rapid transient 1 -D flows in a pipe caused by <b>water</b> <b>hammers.</b> The evolution of the wall shear stress is interpreted in terms of two steps. The first step is the dramatic change of the wall shear stress during the passage of the pressure wave; the corresponding new value of the shear stress is much greater than the value predicted in steady-state. The second step, which begins after the passage of the pressure wave, is a relaxation process; here the shear stress decreases, tending to the new steady-state value corresponding to the new average velocity. The Extended Irreversible Thermodynamics theory is proposed as a tool to model the wall shear stress during the relaxation process. The Friction Relaxation Model presented in this thesis describes both steps of the evolution of the wall shear stress during <b>water</b> <b>hammers,</b> and therefore it enables {{to take into account the}} information about the velocity gradient at the wall, which is otherwise not available in 1 D modelling.

40|$|Pressure surges {{generated}} from condensation induced <b>water</b> <b>hammers</b> {{may lead to}} dynamic stresses which are induced in the walls of pipelines and their support structures. This can cause serious safety risks for human and environment. Besides it can finally lead to operational problems of the pipe plant system. It is desirable to minimise the safety risks already during the design phase of a pipework. This can be achieved using calculation software, that predicts possible pressure surges as exact as possible. This contribution presents simulation results from two numerical schemes, the method of characteristics (MOC) in combination with a discrete vapour cavity (DVC) model and from a finite volume method (FVM), that solves 4, 5 and 6 partial differential equations.
