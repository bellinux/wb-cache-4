[...] "I happened to be lucky enough to discover a really shiny book cover in a book store." [...] Turner stated, [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> it was like, 'Well, I've been on this intellectual quest.' I picked it up, read it and went mental."

500|$|The 12th Man {{tradition}} {{began in}} Dallas on January 2, 1922, at the Dixie Classic, {{the forerunner of}} the Cotton Bowl Classic. [...] A played defending national champion Centre College in the first postseason game in the southwest. [...] In this hard-fought game, which produced national publicity, an underdog Aggie team was slowly defeating a team which had allowed fewer than six points per game. The first half produced so many injuries for A, Coach D. X. Bible feared {{he would not have}} enough men to finish the game. [...] At that moment, he called into the Aggie section of the stands for E. King Gill, a student who had left football after the regular season to play basketball. Gill, who was spotting players for a Waco newspaper and was not in football uniform, donned the uniform of injured player Heine Weir and stood on the sidelines to await his turn. Although he did not actually play in the game, his readiness to play symbolized the willingness of all Aggies to support their team to the point of actually entering the game. When the game ended in a 22-14 Aggie victory, Gill was the only man left standing on the sidelines for the Aggies. Gill later said, [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that I went in and ran for the winning touchdown, but I did not. I simply stood by in case my team needed me." [...] A statue of E. King Gill stands to the north of Kyle Field to remind Aggies of their constant obligation to preserve the spirit of the 12th Man.|$|E
2500|$|Following his {{departure}} from Guns N' Roses, according to Adler, {{he was set}} to join AC/DC and relocate to Australia. However, during the MTV Video Music Awards in September 1990, Axl Rose announced Adler's firing onstage and branded him a drug addict, which Adler said caused AC/DC's manager to withdraw their offer. Adler instead reformed Road Crew with a new line-up, consisting of former Vain members singer Davy Vain, guitarist Jamie Scott, and bassist Ashley Mitchell, along with guitarist Shawn Rorie. They recorded an album and attracted attention from a major label, but due to Adler's persistent drug problems, the group disbanded shortly thereafter. Adler then entered a prolonged, self-imposed exile from the music industry; he later recalled, [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that I {{did a lot of}} traveling or self-improvement, but all I actually did was sit on the couch and get high—while the TV watched me. It was a very, very hard time." ...|$|E

2500|$|An early {{reference}} to the numerical [...] "12th Man" [...] term occurred at the 1922 Dixie Classic, featuring Centre College and The Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (later known as Texas A). During the game, A coach Dana X. Bible realized that one more injury would leave him without another backfield player to send into the game. [...] Coach Bible remembered that E. King Gill, an individual who had tried out for the squad but who [...] "lacked the experience and ability {{to play for the}} varsity" [...] had made the trip {{as a member of the}} school's Corps of Cadets and was sitting with his friends in the stands. [...] Bible sent for Gill and asked for him to suit up and be ready if needed. Gill later said, [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> that I went in and ran for the winning touchdown, but I did not. I simply stood by in case my team needed me."

2500|$|Ward {{said that}} {{although}} Burton is a talented actress and {{has done a great}} job with the character, she did not feel she had to get to know her in order to proceed with the drawings. [...] "It was the character I was drawing for and I learned what I needed to from the show and the scripts," [...] she stated. In describing the process of drawing for a particular episode, she said she would mostly get input from Robbie Beck, the props master for the show. [...] "Schwahn always knew exactly what he wanted and it would be described in the script. So Robbie would send me the info and I would initially do some quick sketches," [...] stated Ward. All of their communication was via e-mail. [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> something more exciting, like [...] and I would chat about what Peyton would be drawing," [...] stated Ward, [...] "but the only time I ever spoke with her was when they were filming at my house in Wilmington (which oddly enough was Peyton’s house on the show.)" [...] Despite this, Ward said she did not mention to Burton that she was the artist behind Peyton's artwork.|$|E

He was apt to be ashamed of his literary efforts after the first moment, and he shuddered at his brother's burlesque of the high romantic vein in which most of his neverended beginnings were conceived. One of his river-faring uncles was visiting with his family at the boy's home when he laid out the scheme of his great fiction of [...] "Hamet el Zegri," [...] and the kindly young aunt took an interest in it which he poorly rewarded a few months later, when she asked how the story was getting on, and he tried to ignore the whole matter, and showed such mortification at the mention of it that the poor lady was quite bewildered.|$|R
6000|$|Bird {{walked up}} and down the room, talking; he seemed overjoyed with the chance, and as if he could not forego it for a moment.

Now I am sixty. Hall the Americans know me. I used to go into the bush with them for bear. Lots of bear in the bush when I first came; now they get pretty scarce. I have the best moose-dog.

Those were his very words; and then he says that if he really cares for you, he'll be sure to come back again, and so you're to answer the letter, and you must call him Dear Mr. Rowan. Don't call him Luke, because young men think so much about those things. And you are to tell him that there isn't to be any engagement, or any letter-writing, or anything of that sort at all. But you can just say something friendly,--about hoping he's quite well, or something of that kind. And then when you come to the end, you had better sign yourself 'Yours truly.'

60|$|The long-tailed or bottle-tit {{is one of}} {{the most}} delicately pretty of our small {{woodland}} birds, and among my treasures, in my invisible and intangible album, there were several pictures of him which I had thought unsurpassable, until on a day two years ago when a new and better one was garnered. I was walking a few miles from Bath by the Avon where it is not more than thirty or forty yards wide, on a cold, windy, very bright day in February. The opposite bank was lined with bushes growing close to the water, the roots and lower trunks of many of them being submerged, as the river was very full; and behind this low growth the ground rose abruptly, forming a long green hill crowned with tall beeches. I stopped to admire one of the bushes across the stream, and <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> now <b>say</b> what its species was: it was low with widespread branches close to the surface of the water, and its leafless twigs were adorned with catkins resembling those of the black poplar, as long as a man's little finger, of a rich dark-red or maroon colour. A party of about a dozen long-tailed tits were travelling, or drifting, in their usual desultory way, through the line of bushes towards this point, and in due time they arrived, one by one, at the bush I was watching, and finding it sheltered from the wind they elected to remain at that spot. For a space of fifteen minutes I looked on with delight, rejoicing at the rare chance which had brought that exquisite bird- and plant-scene before me. The long deep-red pendent catkins and the little pale birdlings among them in their grey and rose-coloured plumage, with long graceful tails and minute round, parroty heads; some quietly perched just above the water, others moving about here and there, occasionally suspending themselves back downwards from the slender terminal twigs--the whole mirrored below. That magical effect of water and sunlight gave to the scene a somewhat fairy-like, an almost illusory, character.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> avoid <b>saying</b> {{anything}} about Worcester, {{for it is}} an obscure and difficult subject; but I fear the attempt to shirk it would be useless in the long run. I know from sad experience that if I omit it every inhabitant of Worcestershire who reads this article will hunt me out somehow, and run me to earth at last, with a letter demanding a full and explicit explanation of this silent insult to his native county. So I must try to put the best possible face upon a troublesome matter. The earliest existing form of the name, after the English Conquest, {{seems to be that}} given in a Latin Charter of the eighth century as Weogorna civitas. (Here it is difficult to disentangle the English from its Latin dress.) A little later it appears in a vernacular shape (also in a charter) as Wigran ceaster. In the later part of the English Chronicle it becomes Wigera ceaster, and Wigra ceaster; but by the twelfth century it has grown into Wigor ceaster, from which the change to Wire ceaster and Worcester (fully pronounced) is not violent. This is all plain sailing enough. But what is the meaning of Wigorna ceaster or Wigran ceaster? And what Roman or English name does it represent? The old English settlers of the neighbourhood formed a little independent principality of Hwiccas (afterwards subdued by the Mercians), and some have accordingly suggested that the original word may have been Hwiccwara ceaster, the Chester of the Hwicca men, which would be analogous to Cant-wara burh (Canterbury), the Bury of the Kent men, or to Wiht-gara burh (Carisbrooke), the Bury of the Wight men. Others, again, connect it with the Braunogenium of the Ravenna geographer, and the Cair Guoranegon or Guiragon of Nennius, which latter is probably itself a corrupted version of the English name. Altogether, it must be allowed that Worcester presents a genuine difficulty, and that the facts about its early forms are themselves decidedly confused, if not contradictory. The only other notable Ceasters, are Alcester, once Alneceaster, in Worcestershire, the Roman Alauna; Gloucester or Glevum, already sufficiently explained; and Mancester in Staffordshire, supposed to occupy the site of Manduessedum.|$|R
6000|$|... 'My dear {{and more}} than dear Bishop,--It would be vain for me to write to you, if I pretended {{to do more than}} just express my heart's <b>wish</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>say</b> {{something}} of the doings and sufferings which now for years past we of course associate with your name, so as to encourage and support you in your present manifold distress. But (especially for reasons known only to myself) I must leave that altogether to Him who helps His own to do and suffer. One thing only I would say, that to us at our great distance it looks as if the sanguis martyrum were being to you as the semen Ecclesiae, and you know how such things were hailed in the time of St. Cyprian. May it please God before long to give you some visible earnest of this sure blessing! but I suppose that if it tarry, it may be the greater when it comes. Our troubles as a Church, though of a different kind, are not small. The great point with me is, lest, if in our anxiety to keep things together, we should be sinfully conniving at what is done against the faith, and so bringing a judgment upon ourselves. I do not for a moment think that by anything which has yet been done or permitted our being as a Church is compromised (though things look alarmingly as if it might be before long), but I fear that her well-being is more and more being damaged by our entire and conscious surrender of the disciplinary part of our trust, and that if we are apathetic in such things we may forfeit our charter. There is no doubt, I fear, that personal unbelief is spreading; but I trust that a deeper faith is spreading also; it is (at Oxford, e.g.) Pusey and Moberly, &c., against the Rationalists and other tempters. As to the question of the Bible being (not only containing) the Word, I had no scruples in signing that Declaration. One thought which helped me was, the use made in the New Testament of the Old, which is such as to show that we are not competent judges as to what passages convey deep moral or religious meanings or no. Another, that in every instance where one had the means of ascertaining, so far as I have known, the Bible difficulty has come right: therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that so it would be in all the rest, if we knew the right reading and the right interpretation of the words. And as to what are called the Divine and Human Elements, I have seemed to help myself with the thought that the Divine adoption (if so be) of the human words warrants their truthfulness, as a man's signature makes a letter his own; but whether this is relevant, I doubt. My wife and I are both on the sick list, and I must now only add that we never forget you.|$|R
