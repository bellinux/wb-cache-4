40|$|The year class {{strength}} of Arcto-Norwegian cod (Gadus morhua L.) in the Barents Sea is extremely variable. One {{of the key}} indicators for a possible strong year class is water temperature since good year classes may be produced in warm years while they seldom if ever occur in cold years. Water temperature alone {{is not sufficient to}} produce a good year class. Thus it is conjectured that when there is a strong flow of Atlantic water from the Norwegian Sea into the Barents Sea it not only warms the water but transports large quantities of zooplankton and hence provides better survival conditions for cod. Survey data from the Barents Sea for the years 1977 through 1984 are examined to determine the relation between zooplankton abundance and the spatial distribution of juvenile cod and to investigate if zooplankton abundance is associated with the flow of Atlantic water. For all years, more zooplankton on average were found in areas with cod than in those <b>without</b> <b>cod.</b> Total zooplankton abundance increased significantly in the Barents Sea concurrently with an increased inflow of Atlantic waters in 1981...|$|R

Method: Thirty ADHD and 30 non-ADHD children (ages 9 - 12) were compared under concurrent variable interval (VI- 15 sec., VI- 30 sec. and VI- 45 sec.) reinforcement schedules that required the child to switch between the three schedules under conditions of experimentally controlled inhibition (change over delay [COD] vs. No COD). Classical matching law {{was used to evaluate}} children’s success in maximizing reinforcement opportunities. Results: Children with ADHD showed normal matching only when immediate reinforcement for responding was blocked by the presence of a 3 -s <b>COD.</b> <b>Without</b> a <b>COD,</b> ADHD children failed to conform to the normal matching law. Non-ADHD children’s behavior fit the matching law (i. e., rate of response was proportional to rate of reinforcement) whether a COD was present or absent. Conclusions: Results supported other findings that response inhibition is a key mechanism in responses to reinforcement schedules by children with ADHD and that the absence of con-tingencies that inhibit impulsive responding might impair complex learning in which the child must choose between many different behavioral options, each with associated reinforcement schedules.

40|$|Cystic ovarian disease (COD) is a {{considerable}} reason for economical losses in beef and dairy cows. Approximatly 30 % of all dairy cows develop COD at least once during their life time. COD {{is defined as a}} fluid filled structure on the ovary exceeding 25 mm in diameter with no palpable luteal structure present. It may be assumed that negative energy balance post partum causes pituitary insufficiency. Diagnosing COD by rectal palpation is reported to be unsafe. The objective of this investigation was to analyse the pevalence of COD and risk factors that are associated with cystic ovarian disease (COD) in dairy cattle. 132 Holstein Friesian cows of a commercial dairy farm were monitored from drying off, beginning of transition period, at calving and post partum every other week until ten weeks after calving. Blood samples were collected, centrifuged and stored at ý 20 oC until analysis. They were analysed for aspartate amino transferase (AST), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), Bilirubin, blood glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), glutamate dehydrogenase (GlDH), free fatty acids (FFA) and insulin. Net acid base excretion levels in urine (NABE), urine pH, body condition (BCS) and back fat thickness (BFT) were measured at the same time from eight weeks ante partum until ten weeks post partum. Urine samples were collected at the same time. NABE and urine pH were determined immediately. Every other week cows were examined clinically per rectum. After 50 d post partum the diagnosis of cysts was subsequently supported by ultrasound. After calving, twice weekly milk samples were collected and stored at ý 20 oC until analysis for progesterone. The samples of cows developing COD were analysed and compared to controls <b>without</b> <b>COD.</b> Prevalence of COD peaked six weeks post partum (18. 9 %). Six to ten weeks post partum, significantly higher levels of FFA and Bilirubin were observed in cows with follicle-theca-cysts. During the post partum period NSBA and pH level of urine of cows with follicle-theca-cysts were significantly lower than of cows <b>without</b> <b>COD.</b> Between drying off and transition we observed high increases of back-fat-thickness in cows with follicle-theca-cysts. We observed a significantly higher milkfat content and fat protein ratio in cows with follicle-theca-cysts on the first milktest day. The prevalence of COD increased with number of lactation. 	 Until 70 d post partum COD was found in 15. 4 % of examination by rectal palpation (n= 632). After analysing progesterone level 24 % of the cows showed ovarian dysfunction. From the observed 15. 4 % COD, 64 % did not show impaired cyclicity. In total there were more follicle-lutein-cysts than follicle-theca-cysts (61. 7 % vs. 38. 3 %). Scanned cows (n= 44) showed 63. 6 % follicle-theca-cysts and 43. 2 % follicle-lutein-cysts. After analysing progesterone, fewer cows (38. 6 %) were diagnosed of having follicle-theca-cysts and follicle-lutein-cysts (18. 2 %), respectively. Diagnosis of ovarian cysts, affecting adversely cows´ reproduction, made by single palpation per rectum or single ultrasonography are insufficient. Only analysis of progesterone profiles can clearly indicate ovarian dysfunction. The results of this investigation showed the enduring strain of the liver, caused by massive lipomobilisation (bilirubin, FFA) and latent acidotic (NABE, pH of urine) metabolism. Until 10 weeks pp the negative energy balance seems to have an effect on liver metabolism. Ketosis and fatty degeneration of liver increases the risk of follicle-theca-cysts especially 6 and 8 weeks post partum. The risk of cysts´ development can not be exactly predicted. The risk of COD can be reduced by assuring a smooth transition period limiting lipomobilisation and risk of acidosis. It remains to be investigated why cows under identical farm conditions and feeding respond differently to the stress of lactation. <br /...|$|R

The cheese {{industry}} {{in the country is}} an activity in constant growth, however there are no regulations for the related activities, facilities, waste management, water management, among others. The lack of implementation tools in clean production and poor liquid waste disposal, generate environmental problems. The whey is the main component of pollution associated with these waters, generating inhibition in the treatment of waste water by high levels of <b>COD,</b> <b>fats,</b> solids and early tendency to acidification. The present investigation provides a diagnostic in environmental issues to some non-industrial cheesemakers, and proposes management strategies by implementing clean production in their processes and an assessment of hybrid RAFA-FAFA anaerobic treatment for decontaminating their wastewaters. Environmental audits were conducted in five dairies in the area of Santa Cruz de Turrialba, where their processes, activities, facilities, and wastewater management were characterized as well as the conduction of physical and chemical analysis for the wastewater in each dairy. Using the tool EcoInspector 2. 1, areas with potential for improvement were identified. A dairy farm was chosen for feeding two pilot hybrid anaerobic reactors. The reactors treatability were evaluated without adding alkalinity, with a COD: 2 (g / L), HTR: 3. 5 d, VOC: 0. 5714 (kg COD / m 3 d *) and then with a dose of 2 g / L NaHCO 3 / L for the substrate, approximately 3 g / L COD, HTR: 2. 3 d, VOC 1. 2857 (kg COD / d * m 3). It was found that while the dairies produce the same type of cheese, there are differences between them and the areas where they present greater opportunities for improvement in the standardizing of their processes, water recycling, wastewater treatment management, curd production for cheese and the reuse of whey. The wastewater generated is difficult to treat and will have variable characteristics; {{it is not possible to}} implement hybrid reactors without adding alkalizing, because the rapid acidification; whereas with values between (3 - 6) g COD/L, the addition of 30 g NaHCO 3 /L of alkalizer for the conditioning of inoculum, 2 g NaHCO 3 /L and 1 mL/L of nutrient solution for the substrate, it is feasible to use hybrid anaerobic systems, reaching COD removal efficiencies between (65 - 90) %, but should expand the study of this type of treatment.

Experimental studies have generally been carried out at a constant prey concentration. However, in reality prey is usually patchy distributed in space and time, and different life history strategies have most likely adapted to survive different regimes depending on the timing of spawning and oceanographic conditions. Along the Norwegian coast, co-occurring herring (Clupea harengus) and cod (Gadus morhua) have different spawning strategies presenting the larvae with different challenges during ELS. We hypothesise that the survival and growth strategies of herring is adapted to coping with longer periods of prey deprivation (i. e. more variable prey availability), in contrast to cod which is adapted to match growth and survival to high prey concentrations during spring bloom. To test this hypothesis we present experimental larval growth and survival data for the two species while reared combined or in single species settings. Two food regimes were offered, either ad libitum (daily adjusted) level or in a pulsed manner where the concentrations were allowed to drop to a third of the initial nominal concentration. Individuals were sampled at regular weekly intervals and all added and sampled fish were counted to allow accurate mortality estimates. The pulsed feeding significantly reduced the initial growth of cod larvae co-reared with herring, while no such effect was seen for the herring. During {{the latter half of the}} larval stage the cod larvae in the pulsed feeding treatment grew at the same rate as those offered the constant prey concentration. Herring ELS reared <b>without</b> <b>cod</b> present, tended to be larger at age than when reared together with cod, and also displayed a significantly higher total survival at the end of the six week experiment (59 % vs. 42 %). For cod ELS, on the other hand, the survival was lower when reared without herring present (24 vs. 31 %), suggesting that the two species cope differently to each others presence. Relatively large sample sizes (over 100 per sampling and 4000 in total) revealed differences in size distributions between treatments. The results are discussed in relation to the differences in life history strategies between the faster growing cod larvae and the more aptly surviving herring larvae. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

With 0. 5 % salt, removal rates lower than 60 % were attained, for ammonia removal efficiency probably due to ionic strength changes and cellular plasmolysis leading to inactivation of the nitrification organisms. The SBR performance was greater for synthetic wastewater, due to the inherent and controlled characteristics.

40|$|Distributed video coding (DVC) is a {{new video}} coding {{technique}} which has low encoder complexity and good error resilience. Rate control {{is one of the}} most important problems in DVC. In order to allocate an optimal number of parity bits for the current frame, most distributed video coders use a feedback channel (FC) to perform rate control at the decoder. However, using feedback channel can increase the decoding complexity and result in transmission delay. To solve these problems, we propose a novel encoder rate control (ERC) algorithm for pixel-domain distributed video (PDDV) <b>coder</b> <b>without</b> feedback channel at the cost of slightly increased encoder complexity. The experiment results show that the performance obtained using our ERC algorithm is comparable to that obtained using the decoder rate control (DRC) algorithm. Baoguo Du and Hong She...|$|R

In experiments with added cholesterol, cod liver oil usually showed lowered values compared with arachis oil and no fat added, but the effect varied greatly. Thus no final conclusions could be drawn. Soya-bean oil did not show any effect compared with arachis oil, whereas basking shark liver oil, dogfish liver oil and squalene lowered the cholesterol level. Methyl ester fractions of cod liver oil with iodine numbers ranging from 78 to 254 were without effect.

40|$|In {{some video}} coding applications, it is {{desirable}} to reduce {{the complexity of the}} video encoder at the expense of a more complex decoder. Distributed Video (DV) Coding is a new paradigm that aims at achieving this. To allocate a proper number of bits to each frame, most DV coding algorithms use a feedback channel (FBC). However, in some cases, a FBC does not exist. In this paper, we therefore propose a rate allocation (RA) algorithm for pixel-domain distributed video (PDDV) coders without FBC. Our algorithm estimates at the encoder the number of bits for every frame without significantly increasing the encoder complexity. For this calculation we consider each pixel of the frame individually, in contrast to our earlier work where the whole frame is treated jointly. Experimental results show that this pixel-based approach delivers better estimates of the adequate encoding rate than the frame-based approach. Compared to the PDDV coder with FBC, the PDDV <b>coder</b> <b>without</b> FBC has only a small loss in RD performance, especially at low rates...|$|R

Some estimates say that the coastline of New England used to extend 75 mi east of its current position; a Native American of the era could have walked from Nantucket to southern Cape <b>Cod</b> <b>without</b> touching the Atlantic Ocean. Another estimate states that New Hampshire's shore could have been a few miles inland. The former estimate is more likely. Fishermen have hauled up mastodon and mammoth teeth miles offshore, suggesting that the forest extended quite far from its western shoreline boundary.

40|$|Cod liver {{is deemed}} to be a rarely eaten food that is mainly {{available}} on the market as a tinned product in its own oil. In some regions, however, it may sometimes be prepared fresh or freshly smoked. Cod liver may contain high levels of dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) as these fat-soluble contaminants accumulate in particular in lean fish, like in the liver of cod. In recent years there was unclarity about {{whether there is a}} maximum level for fish liver in the European Union. In the meantime the European Commission is of the opinion that the assessment of the marketability of cod liver tins can be undertaken using the maximum level for dioxins and PCBs in seafood oils. This maximum level is 10 pictograms WHOPCDD/F-PCB-TEQ 1 per gram <b>fat.</b> <b>Cod</b> liver tins are {{deemed to be}} compound foods containing cod liver and cod liver oil. Freshly smoked cod liver, which is sold on the market, should also be examined for its content of dioxins and dioxin-like PCBs as cod liver oil is also released during preparation that can be eaten with the liver, too. Consumers such as fishermen and anglers who process or eat cod liver themselves, may not be protected by this maximum level. In areas in which cod is caught and processed for personal use, BfR, therefore, recommends the issuing of regional consumption warnings about the liver of this fish by the federal Laender concerned...|$|R

Different concentration of p NP were used due to energy spilling effect in the reactor and {{the results show that}} injection of 100 mg/L p NP to the reactor can reduce synthetic coefficient Y from 0.58 to 0.27 mg biomass/mg <b>COD</b> <b>without</b> p NP injection, so that the excess sludge was reduced by 0.56 %.

In the concentration of 150 mg/L p NP, no sludge was produced, but COD rate of the effluent increased to 480 mg/L. Otherwise, p NP rate is an environmental limitation in effluent and sludge disposal.|$|R
