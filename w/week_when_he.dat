5|$|Chazz Palminteri as U.S. Customs Special Agent Dave Kujan. Singer {{had always}} wanted the actor for the film, {{but he was always}} unavailable. The role was offered to Christopher Walken and Robert De Niro, both of whom turned it down. The filmmakers even had Al Pacino come in and read for the part, but he decided not to do it because he had just played a cop in Heat. Palminteri became available, but only for a <b>week.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> signed on, this persuaded the film's {{financial}} backers to support the film fully because he was a sufficiently high-profile star, thanks to the recent release of A Bronx Tale and Bullets Over Broadway.|$|E
5|$|In September 2007 Evans {{came off}} the bench to make his senior debut in City’s 1–0 League Cup victory against Norwich City. With first choice {{opportunities}} at City limited Evans moved on loan to Norwich City in November of that year, agreeing a deal until 1 January 2008. He made his debut for Norwich the following <b>week</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> came on as a substitute in the 3–1 victory over Blackpool. His first goal for the club came two games later, and just two minutes into his first start in a 2–1 victory over Plymouth Argyle {{at the start of}} December. Evans returned to Manchester City after his initial loan deal expired in January 2008, having made eight appearances and scored two goals.|$|E
5|$|Rhodes rejoined former club Grays Athletic, {{where he}} had played on loan in 2007, on 19 January 2010. He scored a goal on his debut in a hastily {{arranged}} friendly, after their league game with Kidderminster Harriers was postponed, {{later in the week}} during a 4–1 victory against Aveley. Rhodes' senior debut came {{at the end of the}} same <b>week,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was one of six new members of manager Julian Dicks' side, only for them to lose 4–0 to Rhodes' former team Oxford United. Rhodes was substituted by Harry Agombar during the second half. He was released at the end of the 2009–10 season, having made 15 appearances.|$|E

5|$|Richard died on May 10, 1958; it was {{ten days}} before the child's tenth birthday. Skelton was {{scheduled}} to do his weekly television show on the day his son was buried. Though there were recordings of some older programs available which the network could have run, he asked that guest performers be used instead. Calling themselves The Friends of Red Skelton, his friends in the television, film and music industries organized The Friends Of Red Skelton Variety Show, which they performed to replace The Red Skelton Show for that week; by May 27, 1958, Skelton had returned to his program. The death of Richard profoundly affected the family; by 1961 Richard's model trains had been moved to a storeroom in the Bel Air mansion, but Skelton refused to have them dismantled. In 1962, the Skelton family moved to Palm Springs, and Skelton used the Bel Air home only on the two days a <b>week</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was in Los Angeles for his television show taping.|$|E
25|$|The two {{split up}} after {{their most recent}} loss and were on {{opposing}} sides the following <b>week</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> and his new partner, The Super Destroyer, beat Bull Buchanan and Bulldog Raines via disqualification. In SECW, Gower later challenged Raines for the SECW Heavyweight Championship.|$|E
25|$|The Whitecaps {{continued}} their streak of not conceding a goal on March 24 in a 0–0 draw with D.C. United. Cannon {{was awarded with}} his second consecutive Save of the <b>Week</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> blocked a Hamdi Salihi header off a corner kick in the 67th minute. Vancouver capped off the month of March with their fourth clean sheet of the season but, once again, failed to score themselves against the Philadelphia Union.|$|E

25|$|In Aleppo, Syria this custom {{seems to}} go back about 500 years.

25|$|But {{long before}} this, Gleason's nightclub act had {{received}} attention from New York City's inner circle and the fledgling DuMont Television Network. He {{was working at}} Slapsy Maxie's when he was hired to host DuMont's Cavalcade of Stars variety hour in 1950, having been recommended by comedy writer Harry Crane, whom he knew from {{his days as a}} stand up comedian in New York. The program initially had rotating hosts; Gleason was first offered two weeks at $750 per <b>week.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> responded it was not worth the train trip to New York, the offer was extended to four weeks. Gleason returned to New York for the show. He framed the acts with splashy dance numbers, developed sketch characters he would refine over the next decade, and became enough of a presence that CBS wooed him to its network in 1952.|$|E
25|$|McIlroy {{finished}} {{the regular season}} third in the FedEx Cup standings. At The Barclays, {{the first of four}} playoff events, he finished in a tie for 24th, dropping him to fourth in the standings. McIlroy won the following week at the Deutsche Bank Championship to take the top spot in the standings. McIlroy entered the final round three strokes behind Louis Oosthuizen and defeated him by one stroke. The win also put McIlroy {{at the top of the}} PGA Tour money list. McIlroy's success continued the following <b>week</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> won the BMW Championship. He was 40-under par for his two playoff tournament victories. With the win, he became the first European to win four PGA Tour events in a single season and the only person other than Tiger Woods to win four events in a season since 2005.|$|E

25|$|In 2008, Lloyd {{signed a}} three-year {{developmental}} deal with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), {{becoming the first}} South African person to do so. He was assigned to Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), WWE's developmental territory, where he made his debut under his real name on 5 February, in a loss to Kawal. His first win in FCW came the following <b>week,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> teamed with Caylen Croft and Trent Barreta to defeat Tyler Reks, Johnny Curtis, and DJ Gabriel in a six-man tag team match. The following month, he changed his ring name to 'Justin Angel'. He went on to wrestle against DH Smith, Barreta, Yoshitatsu, and Lance Hoyt {{over the next few}} months. In June, he formed a tag team with Kris Logan, with the pair defeating DJ Gabriel and Vic Adams in their debut match as a team. They quickly began to feud with The Dude Busters of Barreta and Croft, losing to them in several championship matches over the next month. At the 23 July 2009 tapings of FCW's television show, Angel and Logan defeated Barreta and Croft to become the Florida Tag Team Champions. They lost the championship on the same night to The Rotundos (Bo and Duke).|$|E
25|$|On 31 March 2008, Ricky {{returns to}} Walford {{unexpectedly}} {{with his sister}} Diane Butcher (Sophie Lawrence) to inform Pat that Frank has died. Frank is cremated in Walford the following day. Ricky's fiancée Melinda (Siobhan Hayes) attends, but soon finishes with Ricky when she discovers he is penniless. The Butcher siblings and Pat scatter Frank's ashes in Albert Square gardens after the reading of his will. Ricky returns the following <b>week</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> discovers Bianca and Liam are living with Pat after being made homeless. Despite initial hostilities, Ricky helps Bianca regain custody of her four children, who have been put into care, and then decides to remain in Walford himself, to be near Liam. Ricky hopes for a reconciliation with Bianca, but she is involved with Tony King (Chris Coghill), and when Tony is released from prison later that year, he moves in with the Butchers. Unbeknown {{to the rest of}} the family, Tony is a paedophile and is having a secret relationship with Bianca's stepdaughter Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty). When this is uncovered, Bianca finishes with Tony and he is imprisoned. Bianca reveals that her youngest daughter, Tiffany (Maisie Smith), is actually the daughter of Ricky, conceived on their one-night stand in 2002. This is confirmed when Ricky takes a paternity test.|$|E
500|$|Miller {{had only}} been back in Australia for a <b>week</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> faced Wally Hammond's visiting English team in the touring side's match against Victoria. His fielding and batting were rusty after the long layoff, and the media {{constantly}} probed him about the contract he had signed with Rawtenstall Cricket Club in the Lancashire League a few months earlier, to start in 1947. Miller said nothing in the press, but the Victorian Cricket Association made public appeals for an employer to give Miller a job {{so that he would}} not leave the state and become a professional sportsman in England. In the match against Hammond's men, Miller struggled while scoring 32 in the first innings before being dismissed by leg spinner Doug Wright. In the Victorian second innings he was bowled by James Langridge for eight. [...] Victorian captain Lindsay Hassett was not willing to ask Miller to bowl, given his lack of thorough preparation for the season; the tourists won the match by 244 runs.|$|E
50|$|In 2009 Ren je Rot {{was back}} on {{television}} as Kies je Ster (compare; Poparound), but by this time Brozius' battle with diabetes had caught up with him; whether he's seen the first episodes or is unknown, only that he'd been in hospital for six <b>weeks</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> died on March 24.|$|R

500|$|Grossman {{remained}} the team's back-up quarterback until week nine against the winless Detroit Lions {{when he was}} called to replace Orton who left the game due an ankle injury. Grossman completed nine of nineteen passes for 58 yards, including a touchdown and interception. He also scored the game's winning touchdown on a quarterback sneak. [...] During {{the course of the}} game, Grossman was repeatedly jeered by Bears fans. [...] After the game, Brian Urlacher defended Grossman, commenting, [...] "We've got a quarterback who comes in off the bench and leads us to a victory, and they boo him right out of the gate. [...] Poor guy. Lucky for him he's resilient and he came back and led us to two scoring drives. [...] But man, it's tough." [...] Lovie Smith named Grossman the team's starting quarterback for the Bears next contest against the Tennessee Titans. Grossman threw one touchdown and interception, and also scored a one-yard rushing touchdown, en route to a 21–14 loss. [...] Grossman received his final snaps of the season in the following <b>week,</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> was called to relieve Orton in a 37–3 loss to the Green Bay Packers.|$|E
500|$|He was {{not offered}} a {{professional}} contract at Chesterfield by manager Arthur Cox and so left the club {{without making a}} senior appearance at Saltergate. However, he was soon spotted playing amateur football in Nunthorpe by Hartlepool United manager Billy Horner. Houchen joined the [...] "Monkey Hangers" [...] on non-contract terms, before turning professional in February 1978, signing a one-year contract on £30 a <b>week.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> arrived at the Victoria Park, Hartlepool were a struggling Fourth Division club. He made his debut in a 1–1 home draw with Crewe Alexandra. Though grateful for the opportunity and training, Houchen lamented that [...] "we {{used to have a}} mad rush to the bank to cash our cheques. Only about six of them would go through and the rest would bounce." [...] He scored his first senior goal against Barnsley on 24 March 1978. He scored further goals against Darlington, Rochdale and Newport County to end the 1977–78 campaign with four goals in 13 games. He played regular first team football in 1978–79, and scored 13 goals in 42 games to become the club's top scorer. He then went on to score 14 goals in 44 games in 1979–80, as the club finished 19th, just two points above the re-election zone. His goalscoring record attracted the attention of bigger clubs, however club chairman Vince Barker told Reading that even if Houchen was available then they {{would not be able to}} afford him. His exploits continued into the following season, and the club rejected bids of up to £80,000 from Plymouth Argyle and Cardiff City. He scored 17 goals in 48 appearances in 1980–81, yet again becoming the club's top scorer, as Hartlepool were in the promotion hunt until a late spell of bad form sent them down the table to ninth. He hit 19 goals in 38 games in 1981–82 to become the club's top-scorer for a fourth consecutive season. However, having scored 65 goals in 170 league appearances, Houchen wanted a move to a bigger club at a higher division; he regularly handed in transfer requests, but all were ignored by the club.|$|E
2500|$|Arsenal {{had offered}} Cole a longer {{contract}} {{to stay at}} the club, but he had been left [...] "trembling with anger" [...] when they offered him wages of £55,000 per week, whereas Chelsea were offering him £90,000 a week.

50|$|Väyrynen {{was ruled}} {{out for a}} few <b>weeks</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had groin surgery which also ruled him out of some of the {{international}} fixtures with Finland. He returned as a substitute for Leeds against Watford on 10 December, and he made an immediate impact <b>when</b> <b>he</b> won an injury time penalty for Leeds to equalise. His second start came in Leeds 4-1 loss against Barnsley on 31 December 2011.|$|R
50|$|Despite being aged 27, Browning {{was signed}} by West Coast in 1989 and finally got his chance to play VFL football.

Norman Barasch described Block giving him his first writing job at $75 a <b>week</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> ghost-wrote jokes for him while Block was head writer for Milton Berle and Ed Wynn.|$|E
2500|$|I {{never even}} heard his name till last <b>week</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> made threats and rants. The guy is a fucking idiot, making threats to me, Clooney, Eli Roth, {{says he has a}} doctorate—but uses the word [...] "retard" [...] in his vocabulary, come on. When you look at his videos, what is {{interesting}} are the backgrounds. I guess his low rent offices, with 15 year old 3/4 machines, archaic computers, this is just some dumb chump trying to get some fame when he has none, so he has to make YouTube lame quality anger rants. This guy just wants attention because he can't get any for the so called movies he makes. Nothing sadder when he had his screening in LA to an over half empty movie house.|$|E

Ironically, the question was taken seriously and addressed to Tennant live on Radio 1 leaving O'Connell rather pleased with the gag.|$|E
