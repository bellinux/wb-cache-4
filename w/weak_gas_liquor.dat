5000|$|Scrubbers which {{utilized}} {{water were}} {{designed in the}} 25 years after {{the foundation of the}} industry. It was discovered that the removal of ammonia from the gas depended upon {{the way in which the}} gas to be purified was contacted by water. This was found to be best performed by the Tower Scrubber. This scrubber consisted of a tall cylindrical vessel, which contained trays or bricks which were supported on grids. The water, or <b>weak</b> <b>gas</b> <b>liquor,</b> trickled over these trays, thereby keeping the exposed surfaces thoroughly wetted. The gas to be purified was run through the tower to be contacted with the liquid. In 1846 George Lowe patented a device with revolving perforated pipes for supplying water or purifying liquor. At a later date, the Rotary Washer Scrubber was introduced by Paddon, who used it at Brighton about 1870. This prototype machine was followed by others of improved construction notably by Kirkham, Hulett, and Chandler, who introduced the well-known Standard Washer Scrubber, Holmes, of Huddersfield, and others. The Tower Scrubber and the Rotary Washer Scrubber made it possible to completely remove ammonia from the gas.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Microbiology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. Sasol plants gasify {{more than}} 30 million {{tons per annum}} of coal via the Fischer- Tropsch process {{resulting}} {{in the production of}} synthesis gas and a condensate stream. After gravimetric separation of the tar products, the solvent extraction of phenolics and the steam stripping of ammonia from the condensate stream, a complex effluent referred to as stripped <b>gas</b> <b>liquor</b> (SGL) is generated. SGL {{has the potential to be}} used as process cooling water. Micro-organisms, scale deposit and corrosion are three major problems associated with the operation of cooling water systems. Parameters that have an influence on the fouling, scaling and corrosion of industrial cooling towers include cycles of concentration (COC), flow velocity (FV) and pH. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of COC, pH and FV on the rates of fouling, scaling and corrosion as well as on the microbial community dynamics in cooling towers using SGL as process cooling water. Stripped <b>gas</b> <b>liquor</b> contains hydrocarbons which can interfere with PLFA analysis. There was, therefore, a need to optimise the selective extraction of hydrocarbons so as to eliminate their interference with PLFA analysis. The method used for the extraction of hydrocarbons before silicic acid fractionation succeeded in removing the hydrocarbons and their interference and was, therefore, determined to be appropriate method to use in subsequent analyses. Even though the two lab-scale cooling towers were of identical design their similarity or dissimilarity needed investigation. Physico-chemical analysis results confirmed that the two cooling towers were operated under identical operational conditions. The two cooling towers were found to be similar in terms of the fouling, scaling and corrosion rates as well as microbial community structure. The two cooling towers could be operated in parallel using different operational conditions with any differences in results being a reflection of the effects of operational conditions. The effects of pH, FV and COC on the rates of fouling, scaling and corrosion as well as microbial community dynamics were evaluated with the aid of a 2 ³ multi-factorial experimental design. Cycles of concentration was found to have the most profound effect on the fouling, scaling and corrosion rates followed by pH. Cycles of concentration and pH were found to have the most profound effect on microbial community dynamics. The use of the 2 ³ multi-factorial experimental design also allowed the determination of optimal conditions for the operation of,the cooling towers using SGE as feed water. These conditions were found to be 5 COC, a pH of 7. 5 and a FV of 0. 6 m/s. In conclusion, the use of a 2 ³ factorial experimental design, physico-chemical, PLFA and DGGE analyses were instrumental in the successful determination of the effects of COC, pH and FV on the rates of fouling, scaling and corrosion as well as on the microbial community dynamics in the cooling towers using SGL as process cooling water.

In different studies, drainage experiments in porous media, initially saturated with a wetting fluid, have been largely devoted by using various type of fluids and different angle values of slant to the horizontal direction, in order to evaluate the effects of gravity forces and the injection flow-rate. However, {{the influence of the}} matrix structure on the capillary and viscous forces as well as the fluids distribution has not been treated sufficiently. In this study, we simulate an ascending air phase flow in a vertical porous channel initially saturated with a liquid phase, in order to evaluate the two previous effects. The numerical study is performed for large range of injected air mass flow rate along the porous channel from the bottom up. The different forces intervening in the drainage process is analyzed according to several permeabilities. The results show that for a <b>weak</b> <b>gas</b> mass flow rate, the capillary effect is dominant and the gas saturation in a porous channel is proportional to the permeability.

40|$|The {{problem of}} non-perturbative {{description}} of unsteady premixed flames with arbitrary gas expansion is solved in the two-dimensional case. Considering the flame as a {{surface of discontinuity}} with arbitrary local burning rate and gas velocity jumps given on it, we show that the front dynamics can be determined without having to solve the flow equations in the bulk. On {{the basis of the}} Thomson circulation theorem, an implicit integral representation of the gas velocity downstream is constructed. It is then simplified by a successive stripping of the potential contributions to obtain an explicit expression for the vortex component near the flame front. We prove that the unknown potential component is left bounded and divergence-free by this procedure, and hence can be eliminated using the dispersion relation for its on-shell value (i. e., the value along the flame front). The resulting system of integro-differential equations relates the on-shell fuel velocity and the front position. As limiting cases, these equations contain all theoretical results on flame dynamics established so far, including the linear equation describing the Darrieus-Landau instability of planar flames, and the nonlinear Sivashinsky-Clavin equation for flames with <b>weak</b> <b>gas</b> expansion.

It is clarified that heterogeneous flow structures still exist in systems with elastic and frictionless particle collisions, even though the particles in the emulsion phase are more loosely packed. The flow structures in various flow regimes, including uniform, bubbling and turbulent fluidization, can be reproduced from these simulations. Systems with strong particle fluctuating motion but <b>weak</b> <b>gas</b> suspension display an emulsion-bubble structure. On the contrary, systems with weak particle fluctuation motion tend to produce uniform structures. If these two interactions are equally important, the system features complex flow patterns resembling those displayed in the turbulent fluidization.

The flow regime transition is actually the macro-scale expression of the altering degree of dominance of particle¿particle and particle¿fluid interactions.
