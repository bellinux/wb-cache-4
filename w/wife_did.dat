5|$|Myers and his <b>wife</b> <b>did</b> {{the first}} balloon {{ascension}} on the Fair grounds on July 4 to race the aeronaut Tracy A. Tisdell to draw crowds. A second ascension {{was done by}} Myers on August 27. He had a balloon race with professor G. E. Tomlinson to the Washington Monument. Both were unsuccessful. Myers landed 21 miles from his starting location and Tomlinson ended up hundreds of miles off course before he landed.|$|E
5|$|Óscar López Rodriguez's {{body was}} taken by his son during the night of 13 July 2012 from the Servicio Médico Legal of San Fernando. His body was waked at his parents' home in Los Boldos, near Santa Cruz, and was buried the {{following}} day in the Cemetery of Santa Cruz, in a ceremony attended by about a hundred persons. His former <b>wife</b> <b>did</b> not attend his funeral.|$|E
5|$|Already lightly {{regarded}} {{because he}} was selected by the Democratic Central Committee instead of a party primary, Fields further weakened his position due {{to some of his}} personal preferences. A devout Methodist and prohibitionist, Fields prohibited both dancing and drinking at the Executive Mansion. He moved the inaugural ball from the mansion to the capitol rotunda, where dancing would be allowed, but he and his <b>wife</b> <b>did</b> not attend. Fields' frugality also led him to keep dairy cows on the mansion's lawn, drawing derision from urban citizens.|$|E

5|$|Henry {{and his new}} <b>wife</b> <b>did</b> not {{conceive}} any children, generating prurient speculation as to the possible explanation, {{and the future of}} the dynasty appeared at risk. Henry may have begun to look among his nephews for a possible heir. He may have considered Stephen of Blois as a possible option and, perhaps in preparation for this, he arranged a beneficial marriage for Stephen to a wealthy heiress, Matilda. Theobald of Blois, his close ally, may have also felt that he was in favour with Henry. William Clito, who was King Louis's preferred choice, remained opposed to Henry and was therefore unsuitable. Henry may have also considered his own illegitimate son, Robert of Gloucester, as a possible candidate, but English tradition and custom would have looked unfavourably on this.|$|E
5|$|The {{first series}} of Spooks saw various storylines {{involving}} the main characters. Among these were Danny's obsession {{with money and}} spending, by hacking into a credit card database to fool it {{to give him a}} better credit rating, and the discovery that Tessa is running phantom agents to pocket their money. Those storylines were intended by Brenton and Wolstencroft to show the audience that the MI5 officers are tempted by money. A principle story arc is Tom dealing with the complexities of his relationship with Ellie, who at first does not know he is a spy. This storyline was based on Mike Baker, whose <b>wife</b> <b>did</b> not know he was a spy {{for the first six months}} they were together. As the series progressed, there were more difficulties with the relationship; Brenton wrote Tom's position as if the character did not see the problem. The same episode also introduced the sexual tension between Danny and Zoe.|$|E
5|$|In the 1340s Ivan Sratsimir rose in {{prominence}} {{because he}} was married and already had children, while his eldest brother Michael Asen and his <b>wife</b> <b>did</b> not produce children for ten years. In 1352 Ivan Alexander introduced the title junior emperor {{in order to secure}} the smooth and secure transition of the throne and Ivan Sratsimir became known by that title. In the end of 1347 or in the beginning of 1348, however, Ivan Alexander divorced with his first wife and sent her to a monastery so he could marry the Jew Sarah-Theodora. That event spoiled the relations between Ivan Sratsimir and his father and the conflict deepened after the birth of Ivan Shishman to Ivan Alexander and Sarah-Theodora in 1350/1351. The conflict climaxed in 1355–1356 when the undisputed heir to the throne, Michael Asen IV, perished in battle against the Ottomans. According to the Majorat system, Ivan Sratsimir should have come next in the succession line but since Ivan Shishman was born in the purple, i.e. after his father was crowned, Ivan Alexander and Sarah-Theodora declared Ivan Shishman successor to the throne. A hint of the feud between father and son {{is the fact that the}} image of Ivan Sratsimir was not included in the Tetraevangelia of Ivan Alexander where the whole imperial family was pictured, including Ivan Alexander's son-in-law. That could mean either that Ivan Sratsimir was disinherited and proclaimed himself emperor in Vidin or that he was denied the title junior emperor and given the rule of Vidin as a compensation.|$|E

5000|$|The strong {{historical}} {{influence of}} Christianity in the US {{may have also}} played a role: the Bible at 1 Corinthians 7:3-5 explains that one has a [...] "conjugal duty" [...] to {{have sexual relations with}} one's spouse (in sharp opposition to sex outside marriage which is considered a sin) and states that [...] "The <b>wife</b> <b>does</b> not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the <b>wife</b> <b>does.</b> Do not deprive one another except with consent (...)" [...] - and this is interpreted by some conservative religious figures as rejecting the possibility of marital rape.|$|R
25|$|Much of William Butler Yeats's later poetry was inspired, {{among other}} facets of occultism, by the Ouija board. Yeats himself {{did not use}} it, but his <b>wife</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{was later}} {{revealed}} by police that Marshall's <b>wife</b> <b>did</b> make a brief 911 call, {{but it only}} described an unspecified emergency and no mention of a stabbing ever took place. She was charged with aggravated battery {{with a deadly weapon}} and is free on $7,500 bail.|$|E
25|$|Paul {{performed}} {{the first known}} children's television show. It aired November 6, 1931, over television station W3XK in Wheaton, Maryland. Paul and his <b>wife</b> <b>did</b> the first professional puppet show at the White House. It was done with their marionettes for President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife in 1934. The Roosevelt's grandchildren were present. It was during traditional Easter egg roll children's festival on the White House lawn.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} these achievements, Wooden {{reportedly}} did not initially enjoy his position, and his <b>wife</b> <b>did</b> not favor living in Los Angeles. When Mel Taube left Purdue in 1950, Wooden's inclination was to return to West Lafayette and finally accept the head coaching job there. He was ultimately dissuaded when UCLA officials reminded {{him that it was}} he who had insisted upon a three-year commitment during negotiations in 1948. Wooden felt that leaving UCLA prior to the expiration of his contract would be tantamount to breaking his word.|$|E
25|$|Monday came, all was well. Tuesday came, he not sick. Wednesday came, {{and still}} he was well; with which his impertinent <b>wife</b> <b>did</b> much twit {{him in his}} teeth. Thursday came, and dinner was ended, he very well: {{he went down to}} the water-side, and took a pair of oars to go to some {{buildings}} he was in hand with in Puddle-dock. Being {{in the middle of the}} Thames, he presently fell down, only saying, 'An impost, an impost,' and so died. A most sad storm of wind immediately following.|$|E
25|$|Baron Mayer de Rothschild and his <b>wife</b> <b>did</b> {{not live}} {{long after the}} Towers' completion. After the Baroness's death it was {{inherited}} by her daughter Hannah, later Countess of Rosebery. Following her death from Bright's Disease in 1890 at age 39, the house became the home of her widower Archibald Philip Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery, later Prime Minister for two years from 1894. In the late 1920s, the fifth earl gave the estate to his son Harry Meyer Archibald Primrose, Lord Dalmeny, who in 1929 {{on the death of}} his father, became the sixth Earl.|$|E

25|$|In 1782, Jouett {{moved to}} what now is Kentucky. A family story says that, {{on his way}} to Kentucky, Jouett heard a woman's screams coming from a house. He burst into the house and found a wife being abused by her husband. He {{attempted}} to help by knocking down the husband, but the <b>wife</b> <b>did</b> not appreciate his involvement and struck him over the head with a pot. The pot's bottom gave out, and the pot became stuck around Jouett's neck. Jouett fled the scene and traveled 35 miles before he found a blacksmith to remove the pot.|$|E
25|$|Tryon as admiral was {{provided}} with a house by the New South Wales government {{on the north shore}} of Sydney Harbour, near the navy anchorages. This was undergoing refurbishment at the time he took command but, once installed, his time as admiral was well remembered for the programme of social engagements and hospitality given to Sydney society as part of his duties. He took an interest in furthering development of the supply depot and repair dock in Sydney Harbour, and {{the construction of a new}} sailors' home to replace an existing one which had become overtaken by demand. Partly because of the unfinished accommodation, and the war scare, his <b>wife</b> <b>did</b> not accompany him to Australia.|$|E
25|$|Norman-Walker was {{supposed}} to take up the new post as the Lieutenant-Governor of the Isle of Man after he had returned to England. But a problem arose when it became known that his wife would not accompany him. The reaction in the Isle of Man was negative, and the Tynwald insisted that Lady Norman-Walker should accompany her husband to assist the Lieutenant Governor in carrying out his social duties. In fact, it {{was not the first time}} that Norman-Walker had taken up a new post alone. When he arrived at Hong Kong to become Colonial Secretary in 1969, his wife was not with him. The absence of his <b>wife</b> <b>did</b> not attract any criticism at that time in Hong Kong, and she arrived later.|$|E

25|$|Monogamy was the rule, and a childless wife {{might give}} her husband a maid to bear him children, who were then {{reckoned}} hers. She remained mistress of her maid, and might degrade her to slavery again for insolence, {{but could not}} sell her if she had borne her husband children. If the <b>wife</b> <b>did</b> this, the Code did not allow the husband to take a concubine; but if she did not, he could do so. The concubine was a co-wife, though not of the same rank; the first wife had no power over her. A concubine was a free woman, often dowered for marriage, and her children were legitimate and lawful heirs. She could only be divorced on the same conditions as a wife.|$|E
25|$|In 1935 the Scheinbergs {{returned}} to America because his American citizenship would have expired {{after more than}} five years abroad. Soon after his return, Scheinberg was offered the position of mashgiach ruchani (spiritual supervisor) of the Yeshiva Chofetz Chaim in Queens founded by Rabbi Dovid Leibowitz. He served in that position for 25 years until leaving to open his own yeshiva, Torah Ore. Scheinberg was known for the warm and caring relationship he developed with his students, and for the kindnesses he and his <b>wife</b> <b>did</b> for neighbors and visitors in their small apartment. Often their daughters slept two to a bed to make room for unexpected guests. During this time, Scheinberg also became the Rav of Congregation Bakash Shalom Anshei Ostrov on the Lower East Side, where he gave Torah lectures to working men.|$|E
25|$|Speck {{worked as}} a laborer for the 7-Up {{bottling}} company in Dallas for almost three years, from August 24, 1960 to July 19, 1963. In October 1961, Speck met 15-year-old Shirley Annette Malone at the Texas State Fair. She became pregnant after three weeks of dating him. Shirley married Speck on January 19, 1962, and initially moved in with him, his mother, his sister Carolyn, and Carolyn's husband. Speck's mother and stepfather had separated, and his stepfather had moved to California. Speck stopped using the name Richard Franklin Lindberg when he got married and began using the name Richard Franklin Speck. When Speck's daughter, Robbie Lynn, was born on July 5, 1962, his <b>wife</b> <b>did</b> not know that Speck was serving a 22-day jail sentence for disturbing the peace in McKinney, Texas after a drunken melee.|$|E
