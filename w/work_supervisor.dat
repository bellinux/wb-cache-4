A passing motorist who also lived nearby stopped at the scene, and asked the woman driving the car if she needed assistance; she declined, claiming to have called roadside assistance. Upon arriving home several minutes later, the motorist reported the accident to emergency services. At 7:46pm, law enforcement arrived at the scene, but the woman had disappeared.|$|E

40|$|Supervision is an {{important}} aspect {{in the practice of}} social work. It enhances the service delivery of social workers to clients. Supervision also gives direction to functional workers. A supervisory position in any welfare organization is a managerial position and supervisors are thus managers. It is therefore important to understand the experiences of social <b>work</b> <b>supervisors</b> as first-line managers in a welfare organization. In light of the above, the goal {{of this study was to}} explore the experiences of social <b>work</b> <b>supervisors</b> as first-line managers in a welfare organization during and after transition from supervisee to supervisor. The research question arising from the goal of the study was: “What are the experiences of social <b>work</b> <b>supervisors</b> as first-line managers in a welfare organization during and after transition from supervisee to supervisor?” A qualitative, explorative study was conducted, with the following objectives: To conceptualize social work supervision theoretically, based on available literature. To explore empirically the experiences of social <b>work</b> <b>supervisors</b> as first-line managers, during and after role transition from supervisee to supervisor. To make recommendations regarding the situation of social <b>work</b> <b>supervisors,</b> in order to improve their service rendering. Nine social <b>work</b> <b>supervisors</b> from the North-Rand Region Service Offices and Institutions of the Department of Social Development formed the sample for the study. After the conclusion of a literature study and pilot study, data collection was based on semistructured interviews with selected supervisors. The main conclusions drawn from the research findings were that social <b>work</b> <b>supervisors</b> go through some difficult experiences when they move from the position of social worker to that of a supervisor. This requires support from their superiors which, according to the study, is currently lacking. The study indicated a need for the generation of more in-depth literature on social work supervision in general. The study was concluded by relevant recommendations to the Department of Social Development in the Gauteng Province. CopyrightDissertation (MSD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010.

40|$|We {{investigated}} whether supervisors' listening {{attitudes and}} skills {{were related to}} working conditions and psychological stress reactions among their subordinates. The subjects included 41 male supervisors and their immediate subordinates (n= 203). The supervisors completed a short version of the Active Listening Attitude Scale (ALAS) consisting of two subscales: Listening Attitude and Listening Skill for Active Listening. The subordinates rated working conditions and their psychological stress reactions using selected scales of the Job Content Questionnaire and the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire. Those subordinates who <b>worked</b> under <b>supervisors</b> with a higher score of Listening Attitude and Listening Skill reported a more favorable psychological stress reaction than those who <b>worked</b> under <b>supervisors</b> with a lower score of Listening Attitude and Listening Skill. Those subordinates who <b>worked</b> under <b>supervisors</b> with a higher score of Listening Skill reported higher worksite support than those who <b>worked</b> under <b>supervisors</b> with a lower score of Listening Skill. Those subordinates who <b>worked</b> under <b>supervisors</b> with a higher score of Listening Attitude reported higher job control than those who <b>worked</b> under <b>supervisors</b> with a lower score of Listening Attitude. A supervisor's listening attitude and skill appeared to affect psychological stress reactions predominantly among male subordinates than among female subordinates. Psychological stress reactions were lower among younger subordinates who <b>worked</b> under <b>supervisors</b> with high listening skill, while no statistically difference was observed among older subordinates. These findings suggest that a supervisor's listening attitude and skill {{have an effect on}} working conditions and psychological stress reactions among subordinates and that the effects vary according to the subordinates' sex and age...|$|R

5000|$|James and Maggie Cawthon {{married in}} 1905 in Athens in {{southern}} Claiborne Parish. Cawthon had a brother, James Dance Cawthon (1915-2011) of Shreveport, who taught briefly at Springhill High School in Springhill in northern Webster Parish {{before he began}} a long career in the accounting department of the United Gas and Pennzoil companies. James Dance Cawthon, {{who served as the}} business administrator for a decade of the First Presbyterian Church of Shreveport, also did some historical writing which was published by the North Louisiana Historical Association. Cawthon had two sisters, Maggie Lee McIntyre (1911-2007) of Doyline, a state social <b>work</b> <b>supervisor</b> from 1935 to 1976, based in Minden, and Miss Annis Ella Cawthon (1909-1999), a former educator in Springhill. In 1950, Annis Cawthon was elected president of the Webster Parish Classroom Teachers Association. She later taught mathematics at Louisiana Tech from 1959-1974. Cawthon's parents and sisters are interred at Doyline Cemetery. All of the Cawthon siblings graduated from Louisiana Tech. [...] Cawthon studied English and history and received his Bachelor of Arts in secondary education from Louisiana Tech in 1934 and his Master of Arts from Louisiana State University at Baton Rouge in 1938. He taught in Webster Parish high schools during the 1930s at Cotton Valley (1934-1935)) and Sarepta (1935-1939). In the 1939-1940 year, he taught at the A. E. Phillips Laboratory School on the Louisiana Tech campus, recruited for that position by Professor Phillips himself. From 1940-1942, Cawthon {{was a member of the}} faculty at Northwestern State University (then known as Louisiana Normal) until he was conscripted at the age of thirty-five into the United States Army during World War II. He served in Europe in the Education-Orientation Division of the armed forces. In 1974, some three decades after the event, he wrote the article, [...] "A School Teacher Gets Drafted," [...] in North Louisiana History. After the war, Cawthon returned briefly to Northwestern and then left to study for his Ed.D. (since recognized by the National Science Foundation as equivalent to a Ph.D.) at the University of Texas at Austin. His major professor, J. G. Umstattd, had worked with him during the war at the Biarritz American University in France.|$|E

Despite this, research on learning activities used during placement and the impact on practice competency and social work identity is limited.
