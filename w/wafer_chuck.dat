50|$|A {{wafer prober}} is a machine {{used to test}} {{integrated}} circuits. For electrical testing a set of microscopic contacts or probes called a probe card are held in place whilst the wafer, vacuum-mounted on a <b>wafer</b> <b>chuck,</b> is moved into electrical contact. When a die (or array of dice) have been electrically tested the prober moves the wafer to the next die (or array) and the next test can start. The wafer prober is usually responsible for loading and unloading the wafers from their carrier (or cassette) and is equipped with automatic pattern recognition optics capable of aligning the wafer with sufficient accuracy to ensure accurate registration between the contact pads on the wafer and {{the tips of the}} probes.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a new O-ring setup for wet-etching processes of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Our new low-cost approach using siloxane-based seal rings entails the single-side etching of silicon and silicon dioxide using potassium hydroxide and buffered hydrofluoric acid, respectively. With this approach, the wafer is not immersed into the etching solution, {{but only the}} side to be etched is {{in contact with the}} solution, hence the previously fabricated device elements {{on the other side of}} the wafer are not damaged. In one process for etching silicon the etch solution is heated by an infrared lamp. We describe the fabrication of various cantilever-based sensors, such as arrays of 0. 8 -um thick levers for a chemical/electronic nose, and 5 -um-thick silicon cantilevers having piezoresistive sensors. Our technique has gooduniformity and process control and, in addition, eliminates mechanical stress on the fragile wafers incurred by <b>wafer</b> <b>chucks,</b> which are required for the conventional immersion approach.

40|$|In {{the field}} of microelectronics, and in {{particular}} the fabrication of microelectronics during plasma etching processes, electrostatic chucks have been used to hold silicon wafers during the plasma etching process. Current electrostatic chucks that operate by the {open_quotes}Johnson-Rahbek Effect{close_quotes} consist of a metallic base plate that is typically coated with a thick layer of slightly conductive dielectric material. A silicon wafer of approximately {{the same size as the}} chuck is placed on top of the chuck and a potential difference of several hundred volts is applied between the silicon and the base plate of the electrostatic chuck. This causes an electrostatic attraction proportional to the square of the electric field in the gap between the silicon <b>wafer</b> and the <b>chuck</b> face. When the chuck is used in a plasma filled chamber the electric potential of the wafer tends to be fixed by the effective potential of the plasma. The purpose of the dielectric layer on the chuck is to prevent the silicon wafer from coming into direct electrical contact with the metallic part of the chuck and shorting out the potential difference. On the other hand, a small amount of conductivity appears to be desirable in the dielectric coating so that much of its free surface between points of contact with the silicon wafer is maintained near the potential of the metallic base plate; otherwise, a much larger potential difference would be needed to produce a sufficiently large electric field in the vacuum gap between the <b>wafer</b> and <b>chuck.</b> Typically, the face of the chuck has a pattern of grooves in which about 10 torr pressure of helium gas is maintained. This gas provides cooling (thermal contact) between the <b>wafer</b> and the <b>chuck.</b> A pressure of 10 torr is equivalent to about 0. 2 psi...|$|R
40|$|The {{electronics}} industry aims at following Moore's {{law which}} states {{that the amount of}} transistors per unit area doubles every two years. To achieve this, the industry manufacturing Integrated Circuits (ICs) requires production technologies capable of producing smaller details. The machines capable of fulfilling these demands become more expensive and so does the cost per chip. This increase in cost is undesirable and a solution to this problem is to increase the production volumes per unit of time per machine. The industry's approach to increase the production volumes is to increase the diameter of the wafer from 300 mm to 450 mm. The increase in size of some components in the lithography machines introduces a number of challenges to the position control of the <b>wafer</b> <b>chuck</b> in lithography machines. The main challenge is the positioning accuracy requirements of the <b>wafer</b> <b>chuck</b> with respect to {{the focal point of the}} projection optics. This is caused by the decreased stiffness of the <b>wafer</b> <b>chuck,</b> which induces undesirable deformations of the wafer resulting in decreased positioning accuracy of the chuck with respect to the focal point. Recently, two new algorithms for estimating the wafer and <b>wafer</b> <b>chuck</b> deformations have been developed that may help solve this problem. The estimation algorithms rely on models to generate accurate estimates. In general the input, output, or both signals are not measurable. Therefore, it is not straight forward to apply system identification techniques to obtain a model. As alternative a model can be obtained from physical modeling. Both approaches are likely to result in a mathematical model with high uncertainties. The effect of model uncertainty on one of the estimation algorithms is studied in this thesis. The model uncertainty is propagated through the algorithm to obtain a theoretical upper bound on the estimation error. The error bounds are also used to solve the constructed Least Squares (LS) problems using Robust Least Squares (RLS) algorithms where for a case study the estimation accuracy is analyzed and compared with the estimates obtained using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). It is concluded that the usage of RLS algorithms together with the obtained error bounds increases the estimation quality under certain conditions. Furthermore, to show that these algorithms work, experimental results are preferred over simulation results and therefore an experimental setup is designed. The setup will also be used to demonstrate the capabilities of the estimation algorithms under conditions that are topologically similar to those in a real lithography machine. Finally, the setup has been build and its performance is validated using measurements. From these measurements it is concluded that the setup's specification matches with the designed specifications.

Based on a scenario of electron beam writing at an exposure power of 20 mW, the thermo-mechanical behavior of the chuck and the attached Si wafer is modeled and used to derive corresponding IPD values. To account for the pin structured chuck surface, an effective layer model is derived. Different materials for the <b>wafer</b> <b>chuck</b> are compared with respect to their influence on wafer IPD and thermal characteristics of the exposure process.

Comparing these values with FE calculations based on the <b>wafer</b> parameter and <b>chuck</b> design data, the local electrostatic forces can be derived. Our measurements reveal considerable stochastic bending variation across the surface, but are (on the whole) in good agreement with calculated electrostatic forces from the chuck design and demonstrate the potential of this method for chuck characterization...|$|R
40|$|In high-precision motion systems, {{tracking}} {{often comes}} {{with the problem of}} overshoot or poor settling behavior. To deal with this problem, a sliding mode controller with saturated integrator is studied. For large servo signals, sufficiently removed from the sliding surface, the controller will operate in PD mode. This limits the integrator buffer, and thus the overshoot. At the sliding surface (for small servo signals) the controller operates in PID mode with the aim to avoid steady-state error. Tuning of the controller parameters: the switching gain and the saturation length, strongly affects the tracking performance. For this reason, a self-tuning method is proposed. In the method, the required gradients are partly computed using models of the system and the controller. For the remaining part, sampled data is used to deal with disturbances and model uncertainties. With a Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm numerical problems associated with the gradient computations are avoided. The sliding mode controller with optimized parameters is implemented on an industrial wafer scanner to improve throughput during the <b>wafer</b> stage (<b>chuck)</b> exchange...|$|R

40|$|Overlay {{accuracy}} {{is one of}} the most important lithographic topics for ULSI device production. Significant contributions to the overlay like alignment accuracy and mask distortion are well known and subject of continuous investigations. Below an accuracy range of 100 nm additional influences must be taken into account, which were usually neglected for relaxed design rules. One of these influences is directly related to wafer distortions induced by flatness inaccuracies of wafer chucks used for instance in X-ray or optical steppers. This impact was characterised by investigating the elastic behaviour of 4 " wafers, fixed on a <b>wafer</b> <b>chuck.</b> The resulting strains and elongations in the wafer surface were measured by exposure experiments and compared with additional FEM calculations.

This impact was characterized by investigating the elastic behaviour of 4 wafers (525 mym thick), fixed on a <b>wafer</b> <b>chuck.</b> Induced elastical deformation due to flatness error of the chuck causes strains and elongations in the wafer surface and therefore wafer distortions.

40|$|For {{advanced}} lithography applications, high-precision electrostatic chucks with diameters up to 12 inch {{are being}} developed at IOF. Although electrostatic chucking is mostly used in vacuum, the principle also works under ambient conditions. However, forces exerted on the wafer {{may not be the}} same in both cases. To quantify the influence of environmental conditions, electrostatic forces for various chuck dielectrics were measured under ambient conditions (humid air), dry nitrogen and in vacuum. The forces are found to be significantly reduced at ambient conditions as compared to the vacuum case. When flushing with dry nitrogen, the vacuum level is essentially retained. Clearly, water at the chuck-to-wafer interface reduces the chucking force. We suspect that dissociation of water occurs, entailing ionic charge transport and trapping in the dielectric.

For this purpose, test wafers (4 '' to 8 '' in diameter) and X-ray masks have been prepared. An alternative exposure concept has been tested, where the radiation beam sweeps over the exposure field {{by means of an}} oscillating mirror and a moving beamline window. This concept enables shorter exposure times. The alignment accuracy has been improved by implementing new alignment patterns and an adapted evaluation software. This alignment pattern design was especially advantageous with mask/wafer gap values less than 50 microns. Theoretical investigations disclosed the influence of wafer-topography and resist coverage of the alignment marks on the alignment result. Experiments and Finite-Element-Modelling calculations (FEM) have been performed to break down the contribution of particles between wafer and <b>wafer</b> <b>chuck</b> on the overlay result.

Through nanopatterning of thin film structures, magnetic shape effects can be investigated. A novel patterning method, combining substrate conformal imprint lithography (SCIL) with ion implantation, was used to pattern areas up to 7. 5 x 7. 5 mm² of identical ferromagnetic nanoscale lines in thin films of La 0. 7 Sr 0. 3 MnO 3 (LSMO) and LaFeO 3 (LFO). The pattern had a linewidth of 160 nm and a pitch of 400 nm, and the lines were embedded in a paramagnetic matrix. In order to perform SCIL on square substrates, an adapter was manufactured in order for the samples to fit on a two-inch SCIL <b>wafer</b> <b>chuck.</b> A dual-layer mask of Amonil and PMMA resists with a total thickness of approximately 180 nm was shown to work successfully as an implantation mask for 50 keV Ar+ ions that disrupted the magnetic order of the unprotected areas of the thin film.
