5000|$|... 1820: About this date, Grandfather James O'Halloran {{was born}} in Armagh, Ireland.1827: His parents with their {{children}} emigrated to America, settling in Burlington Vermont. They had sailed from Cork.They were Roman Catholics, and {{it must have been}} the case that some of the well-off parishioners became very interested in the affairs of the new Irish arrivals. Certainly one such family persuaded the O'H parents to let them take little Elizabeth to live with them. She was a bit younger than James, and a most beautiful child. Apparently, the arrangement allowed no interference with family communication, so she was not adopted but simply taken good care of, since her own parents were poor. But the circumstance led to her meeting and friendship with an outstanding young lawyer from Montreal, Marcus Doherty - who became a guest in the house when Elizabeth was in her teens. They married when she was quite young, and of course made Montreal their home. - (This family connection with Marcus Doherty would be one of the influences on James, causing him to be a Canadian citizen for the major part of his life).James began a business while still a little lad at junior school, selling papers and taking unusual interest in the printing office. To the point, that he was able to have work in the office while he was still a young school-boy. By age fourteen, he interviewed the authorities in the university of Vermont to see if they would allow him to begin university work, at once. He admitted that up to then, he [...] "had no Latin", but asked if he might not try the first University year despite this. Adding, that if at the end he did not pass as well as the other students, he would not ask them to give him a further try. His efforts were successful. (For several years, near the end of his life, - there used to be a fresh, illuminated document, each autumn, on his mantel shelf; - the invitation to their oldest, living graduate, to attend the Commencement ceremonies at university of Vermont, Burlington). - His work meant not only the B.A. but also his reading of Law - So his anxiety to begin early, had sound reasons. Naturally too, he knew that he would be trying to earn his living while a student; and this led to his work as tutor during the latter part of the time.One season, while tutoring in the south, with some family there, he, and they, were distracted by events in the war between Mexico and the U.S. and James enlisted with the American troops, and went off to the border with them. His column was promptly taken as prisoners of war by the Mexicans, and when it became clear that they, the prisoners, were being lined up to be shot, James felt stupid at realizing he could speak no Spanish, since he had a hunch there was a mistake somewhere about this order. He decided on the next-best thing, and began to repeat the Pater Noster - It had an electric effect - Shouting, [...] "Chretiano! Chretiano!!"- the Mexican officer countermanded, and the prisoners were presently freed completely. Apparently, the Americans had been mistaken for northern Indians and as the main body of American forces were close by the place, it was not the intention of the Mexicans to draw fire from there. The whole war must have been fairly short; but James' commanding officer did not forget him. The same officer was in command of troops in the western States when California was taken into the fold. He was in search of someone to be appointed first Chief Magistrate of the new State, and he wrote offering the post to James O'H. - This must have been close to 1847, as I think that 1847 must also have been the year of marriage between James and his wife. She was Mary Anne Finley, of Dunham, Quebec and she was 17 years old when she married James, who was about 27 then. - In re the offer of a big California post to him, he answered the officer with the explanation that he had arranged to practice law in Canada, where he had bought a farm for his parents, and was also about to be married, and therefore must decline the invitation.Dunham, prior to 1866, meant the Township of Dunham, which included Cowansville, Sweetsburg and many more square miles. The History of Dunham claims that it was the first of the so-called Townships. Long before that date, English-speaking citizens had been encouraged by the British Govt to buy land and develop villages, near the border with the U S. - Hence, the logical place for James O'H to invest in some small holding for the parents (I think that the O'H great-grandparents were never able to make headway with finances, and James would want them within reach wherever he settled down to practise law.)- The Dunham area would be among the first to have a court of law, serving rural places near Montreal. Modern Dunham is still a fairly small village - but in the 1840s and 1850s, it was a larger place than the other villages.Where James and Mary Anne lived for the first few years of their marriage, I do not know - somewhere in Cowansville as it was, in early days. The brick house on the main street, part-way to Sweetsburg, was built by James before the 8th child was born. This child was …rest is cut off the bottom of the page…the family to be born in the house where her parents spent the rest of their lives.Aside from his law practice, James O'Halloran had many interests. For a time, he represented Missisquoi County in the Quebec Legislature, before and after the 1867 debates. He approved Confederation, but voted for delaying it, in favour of giving people more time to comprehend. He probably knew more about the vast problems in the U.S. at that time, than any of the others in Canadian politics, and was not easily alarmed by fears of annexation that some of his colleagues suggested. - He had what few other people ever experience: the gift of remembering word for word, whatever he read that was worth remembering. And he read enormously. The development of Canada in his day was tied up with transportation problems: hence, he knew railroad-minded people, and this explains, in part, his long association with the law department of the C.P.R. and as a side-line, with the Boston & Maine. All of his older life, until almost 90, he travelled certain days of the week into Montreal to his office in the C.P.R. building, returning to Cowansville that evening. (As a youngster, one of my treats was to drive with the gardener to the train to meet him, or to take him in the morning) He may have done this less often, by the time he reached 85 - But he was wonderfully himself, and well, until a very great age. - - In village matters when younger, he had been active in getting both the Catholic and the Anglican churches built. And he was certainly consulted often by both Priest and Rector, in all their concerns. Someone once asked him what he was going to do about his children, since he was a Catholic and his wife a Protestant. James answered that if his wife could bring up her children to be as good as she was herself, this was his best wish for them.He meant what he said, always - and was so genuine in everything, that one knew he was deeply religious at heart, but felt that the sect to which one had belonged was personal, and not a matter for dispute. By the time that I came along, he began to show age in the whiteness of his hair and he looked as the Notman picture of him shows him, from the time when I can first remember him (high-chair age for me) until he died, when I was 21. So it is remarkable that he could be as companionable as he was, to a small grandchild. I slid down the stairs on its mahogany rail, to meet him quickly once -, when we were both dismayed to see that the brass buttons on my sailor suit had scratched the rail! He went to his library and came right back with the ink-pot, and carefully covered the tell-tale marks, - to the complete satisfaction of ourselves. But the ink was green, after all. So the other elders beheld the damage and no one was fooled. But, no one dared say anything - Helen was too small to have handled all that ink so deftly, and <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> other things.... He spoke most beautifully, and read aloud or quoted as naturally as he would talk. It was a treat if he asked at Sunday lunch what the text of the sermon was. First, a bit of rustle on the part of the Aunts, to remember and quote correctly. - Grandfather would take up the narrative, and finish that part of the scripture, or even lead up to it and end the verses, as though the Book were open in front of him - He must have been past 65 when I was at boarding-school, and spending some holidays at Cowansville. He wanted to know what I was studying at the moment, and I mentioned, proudly, that I had begun to read Virgil. -He just commenced with the first Book and went on for at least two pages -verbatim. This I knew, as I had had to memorize most of it as I went along. -But it must have been generations since he had looked at it!The O'Halloran house in Cowansville must have been a great hive of industry for its first 50 years, with the large family of young people, and the many other relations who stayed or lived there. James' mother lived with them after being a widow, and partially blind. She used to do fine hemming for the household, and Mother and Uncle Jim, when children, always threaded numerous needles for the days' work of their Granny. - Later, when the Finley grandparents were gone, their youngest daughter, Jane, came to live with the O'H's - and presently, older nephews joined the family for their school holidays. Our Uncle Joe was only about 20, when I first remember staying in the house - and several of his own nieces and nephews were so close to his age then, that none of us ever called him [...] "Uncle". - Small wonder if the house always had a festive, hospitable air, to me, and I know that the Grandparents were never happier than when the place was filled by all ages of us... Music at home was a must, in those days, and James was almost as fond of music as of his books. So the older sisters and Mother could never remember a time when they could not read and play whatever music the occasion needed. Lessons in Montreal or from good organists elsewhere were provided for them, as long as they wished to study (They were a mystery to me, as I am convinced they knew as much instinctively, as from anything they were taught!)The last few years of the household were very quiet, with only James and his dear [...] "Sissy", as he called Aunt Elizabeth. He was in his 90's, and still active, until a short attack of pneumonia. Sitting up in bed, and wishing to have the Home Rule Bill for Ireland read to him from the morning paper, he listened with attention -, and this way, he died, as though falling asleep. This was the summer of 1913. He was 93.|$|E

40|$|Sustainable Development was {{conceived}} as a visionary idea to have society {{meet the needs of}} the today while also considering those of future generations. The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development was developed to provide an operational planning methodology to move society towards ecological and social sustainability. While abundant scientific research and project work have been completed in the ecological issues area - a significant gap remains regarding Social Sustainability. This research project sought to identify leading Actions of Social Sustainability that might strategically remove the systemic conditions (barriers) to Social Sustainability. Reducing the complexity of Social Sustainability for sustainability practitioners can be helpful for working within Strategic Sustainable Development. Using an assessment tool based on Social Sustainability Actions Criteria, leading Actions of Strategic Sustainable Development emerged from case studies and interviews research with social sustainability practitioners and experts. Although this research process was successful, the study of Social Sustainability Actions also resulted in two aspects of proposed discovery: a means to identify systems barriers within a Social Sustainability Actions Criteria Tool and a model of Core Characteristics of Social Sustainability Actions. Additionally proposed, 3 potential Universal Categories of Social Sustainability Actions. Actions speak louder than words - It means a lot more if we act on our beliefs than if <b>we</b> <b>just</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> them.

50|$|In Adamczewski’s view « … {{languages}} {{have two}} parallel series of grammatical markers, {{from which the}} speaker alternately chooses according to his/her strategy in terms of meaning » (1999: 72-transl. ours). Phase 1 markers are those grammatical items which indicate open paradigmatic choice, while Phase 2 items, marking closed paradigmatic choice, enable the speaker to use {{the result of that}} operation to express his/her own standpoint relative to what s/he is saying and relative to the addressee (this for instance could be warning, or regret, or justification...). Phase 2 markers will therefore appear in what is referred to as ‘presupposing contexts’ in the theory. Let us take the example of the French microsystem VOICI/VOILA. In Voici le Professeur X (« This is Professor X »), the NP le Professeur X is non-predictable (open paradigmatic choice), hence the element of surprise that more or less accompanies such utterances; in Voilà le Professeur X (« Here comes Professor X »), somehow the NP le Professeur X is already part of the linguistic context and/or situation of utterance, for instance because it has been mentioned before (« Why! <b>We</b> were <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> Professor X, and here he comes. »).|$|R

On writing with Stump, Black said that it was [...] "very simple in that <b>we</b> <b>just</b> sat and <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> things that we mutually hated for like a half an hour and then <b>we</b> <b>just</b> put them in a list and that is the lyrics to the song.” ...|$|R
40|$|Not all {{investors are}} rational. Quite {{apart from the}} obvious {{examples}} of credulity {{in the face of}} the latest Ponzi scheme, there is no shortage of evidence that many investors 2 ̆ 7 decisions are influenced by systematic biases that impair their abilities to maximize their investment returns. For example, investors will often hold onto poorly performing stocks longer than warranted, hoping to recoup their losses. Other investors will engage in speculative trading, dissipating their returns by paying larger commissions than more passive investors. And <b>we</b> are not <b>just</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> widows and orphans here. There is evidence that supposedly sophisticated institutional investors-mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies-suffer from similar biases that impair their decisions. These biases are not merely isolated quirks, rather, they are consistent, deep-rooted, and systematic behavioral patterns. Apparently even the considerable sums at stake in the securities markets are not enough to induce market participants to overcome these cognitive defects on a consistent basis...|$|R
40|$|There {{were plenty}} of scary moments at our Fall Popular Economics Institute as we {{explored}} hair raising tales of financial risk taking, predatory lending, zombie banks, toxic assets and the frightening impenetrability of exotic financial instruments such as MBS, CDOs, CDS, SIVs. We also heard stories about how people’s lives {{have been affected by}} the current economic crisis as well as the longer term simmering crisis of downsizing, job loss, increasing job insecurity and criminalization. Our discussion about climate change was highly alarming but also drove home a sense of urgency and we looked at a number of local to national responses. <b>We</b> didn’t <b>just</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the scary stuff. We also discussed ways to build the solidarity economy which puts people and planet front and center. We had a wonderful day trip over the Smoky Mountains to Asheville, NC where we had a delicious lunch at Firestorm Café, a worker owned cooperative. The Café was gracious enough to let us use their meeting space {{in the back of the}} café for our session on the roots of the economic crisis. After that we had presentations from a couple of immigrant women’s cooperatives – a cleaning coop and a textile coop that makes dolls and clothing. One of the worker-owners of Firestorm also gave a presentation about the café and how it serves as a community space for meetings as well as just kicking back with a good cup of joe and a vegan cookie. From there we visited Trash Inc, a social enterprise that sells waste and surplus materials to artists, teachers an...|$|R

Abrams, co-creator of the television series Lost, {{was said to be}} attached to produce and direct. Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof, who co-created Lost with Abrams, optioned The Dark Tower from King for a reported amount of $19, a number that mysteriously recurs throughout the series. According to issue #923 of Entertainment Weekly, King [...] "is an ardent supporter of Lost and trusts Abrams to translate his vision" [...] into a film franchise, with Lindelof being [...] "the leading candidate to write the screenplay for the first installment." [...] It was around this time that Marvel Comics launched their graphic novel {{adaptation of}} The Dark Tower with The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger Born.

40|$|Excerpt] Class is {{the last}} great taboo in the United States. It is, {{according}} to Noam Chomsky, “the unmentionable five-letter word. ” Even in this period of growing economic inequality, we hardly ever <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> class. We hear daily, in the mainstream media, about unemployment, bailouts, proposed tax cuts or tax hikes, Congress regulating one industry and deregulating another, budget cuts, recession, recovery, roller-coaster markets, CEO bonuses, and more. Given all the attention to economics, {{it is interesting that}} <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> social class has been so skimpy. Sometimes I think of class as our collective, national family secret. And, as any therapist will tell you, family secrets are problematic. With rare exceptions, <b>we</b> <b>just</b> don’t <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> class in the United States. Most of us believe that the United States is a classless society, one that is basically middle class (except for a few unfortu­nate poor people and some lucky rich ones). Sometimes <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> class is really about race. We have no shared language about class. We have been taught from childhood myths and misconceptions around class mobility and the American dream. Many of us are confused about class and don’t tend to think about it as consciously as we might our race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, or sexual orientation. Nonetheless, our class identity has a huge impact on every aspect of our lives: from parenting style to how we speak, from what we dare to dream to the likelihood we will spend time in prison, from how we spend our days to how many days we have. We are living in a period of extraordinary economic insecurity and inequality. It is an inequality that crushes the poor, drains the working class, eliminates the middle class, simultaneously aggrandizes and dehumanizes the rich, and disembowels democracy...|$|R

We had a bunch of different names, and thoughts and ideas. But it really just turned into what it sounds like. It sounded like New York and it sounded like a love story, so it really just kind of gave itself that name. <b>We</b> <b>just</b> let everybody know." [...] In the same interview, he spoke about whose idea it was to use classic samples on the album, saying: [...] "Yes. It was a mix of both our ideas and thoughts. Salaam Remi came to the table and first it was moreso like a test, he wanted to see what I could do with certain songs. I think the first song I recorded was [...] "Own It". And he just wanted to see what I could do with that, and we did it. Then <b>we</b> <b>just</b> started <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> different beats we wanted to try and it was a real moment, us just trying to figure out different things we could flip around like [...] "Yo, what if we flip this beat like this?" [...] or [...] "Yo, what if <b>we</b> <b>just</b> pull this from this and did that? Yo, that would be crazy." [...] I think one of the first beats that we flipped was [...] "Hennesy" [...] with the Mobb Deep sample. And it just really came together. He played it for Havoc, Havoc loved it, gave him the original beat for it. Havoc twisted it, fixed it up. It was dope. It really just came together from there." ...|$|R
40|$|Gen Y may be {{social media}} experts, but Public Relations {{students}} at The University of Notre Dame Australia, Sydney Campus, {{are facing the}} challenge of turning tweets, posts and status updates into cash. As part of their major assessment task, the third year students are developing online marketing plans {{for some of the}} country’s most reputable non-government organisations (NGOs) : Barnardos, The World Wildlife Fund and The Wine Society. Following a briefing on their clients’ requirements, the students will develop a fresh online strategy to pitch to the organisations. Phillip Cenere, Associate Dean of the School of Business, Sydney Campus, said the e-PR program prepares students for work in the real world. “The public relations program at Notre Dame is designed to offer students hands-on practical experience. In e-PR <b>we</b> don’t <b>just</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> online PR, <b>we</b> go out there and do it!” Mr Cenere said. PR student Emma Sweeny is creating an e-PR strategy for The Wine Society and says the development process mirrors that of a real PR agency. “We are expected to meet face to face with our client to discuss the brief, communicate regularly with our client through Work in Progress updates each fortnight, and ultimately, to create a communications plan which will be pitched to our client,” Ms Sweeny says. PR students from the Sydney School of Business are well-placed to enter the workforce because of their practical experience in helping businesses {{make the most of the}} opportunities provided by the ever-evolving online marketplace. “Many organisations are targeting and recruiting students and recent graduates because of their familiarity with social media,” said Mr Cenere. “It’s a win-win scenario for the NGOs and students – the students receive invaluable experience learning to work on real projects and the not-for-profit organisations get to tap into the networking skills of Generation Y. ” For further information please contact: Communications Officer, Elizabeth Fenech The University of Notre Dame Australia, Sydney Campus T: 02 8204 4407 E: elizabeth. fenech@nd. edu. au W: www. nd. edu. au...|$|R
