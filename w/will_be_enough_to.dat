5|$|The ruling {{clears the}} way for the plaintiff-respondents to collect from the roughly $1.75billion bank account, which <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> satisfy about 70% of their {{collective}} $2.5billion in judgments. They will not be eligible to collect from a $1billion fund—the Victims of State Sponsored Terrorism Fund—established by Congress in 2015 to pay victims of state-sponsored terrorism. That fund pays 30% of judgments until all applicants have received that amount; remaining funds will not be distributed until all claimants have received 30% of their judgment.|$|E
25|$|The {{society does}} not have any bylaws. Unlike the New Republican Society, the Republican Society does not {{undertake}} actions to bring the republic closer. It proceeds from the notion that the mere existence of the Republican Society <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> enable the restoration of the Dutch Republic in the long term. One can only become a member by co-optation.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the guests}} are three fairies, Flora, Fauna, and Merryweather, {{who have come}} to bless the child with gifts. Flora and Fauna give their gifts of beauty and song, respectively. Before Merryweather is able to give her blessing, the evil fairy Maleficent appears, only to be told that she was not invited. Maleficent turns to leave, but when Queen Leah asks if she's offended, the evil fairy curses the princess, proclaiming that Aurora will grow in grace and beauty, but before the sun sets on her sixteenth birthday, she will use her finger to touch the spindle of a {{spinning}} wheel and die. King Stefan and Queen Leah are horrified and beg the fairies to break the curse. Unfortunately, they are not strong enough to break it, but Merryweather uses her blessing to soften the curse so that instead of dying, Aurora will fall into a deep sleep from which she can only be awakened by true love's kiss. King Stefan, still fearful for his daughter's life, orders all spinning wheels in the kingdom to be burned. The fairies do not believe that <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> keep Aurora safe, and so they spirit her away to a woodcutter's cottage in the forest until the day of her sixteenth birthday.|$|E

500|$|Matilda {{had been}} the pre-Award season favorite, but as the season progressed, {{it became clear that}} Kinky Boots and the revival of Pippin would provide serious competition. Early in the 2013 awards season, Kinky Boots did well, {{receiving}} Drama League Award nominations for Distinguished Production of a Musical and Distinguished Performance, for both Porter and Sands, and winning for Distinguished Production. The show received nine Outer Critics Circle Award nominations, winning three, including Outstanding New Broadway Musical, Outstanding New Score and Outstanding Actor in a Musical (Porter). The musical received only two Drama Desk Award nominations, however, and only one win: Porter for Outstanding Actor in a Musical. [...] New York Times theatre writer Patrick Healy, however, reported that some Tony voters found Matilda [...] "dark" [...] and [...] "a bit chilly", and accurately predicted that [...] "while the cleverness of Matilda may be enough to win best book, the warmth of Kinky Boots <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> score an upset and take the top Tony for best musical." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stated another way, this {{subjective}} test {{means that the}} Government is permitted to entrap {{a person with a}} criminal record or bad reputation, and then to prosecute him for the manufactured crime, confident that his record or reputation itself <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> show that he was predisposed to commit the offense anyway ... In my view, a person's alleged [...] "predisposition" [...] to crime should not expose him to government participation in the criminal transaction that would be otherwise unlawful.|$|E
2500|$|... "I Want It That Way" [...] was {{met with}} {{positive}} reception from most music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic picked the song as a highlight on Millennium, calling it an [...] "infectious song that <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> satisfy anyone craving more, more, more." [...] While reviewing their compilation, The Hits – Chapter One (2001), Erlewine reassured that the song [...] " [...] transcend their era", calling it a [...] "lovely pop tune." [...] Jim Farber of Entertainment Weekly wrote the track [...] "ranks as the bubblegum ballad of the year. It's so likable, it doesn't matter that the group's voices are the sonic equivalent of warm milk." ...|$|E

2500|$|Abdul Jalil Khalil, an Al Wefaq National Islamic Society {{member of}} parliament, {{described}} the 17 February pre-dawn police {{raid on the}} Pearl Roundabout encampment as [...] "real terrorism", stating that [...] "whoever took the decision to attack the protest was aiming to kill." [...] Its MP Jassim Hussein said that [...] "I don't think the regime is willing to meet most of our demands. But even if it does, I am not sure it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> get the youth off the street. It is personal now." [...] Following demands from young protesters {{for the end of}} the ruling regime and in protest against the deaths during demonstrations, all eighteen party MPs submitted their official resignations from parliament.|$|E
2500|$|Legal {{actions by}} Friends of the Everglades {{have gone to}} the Supreme Court of the United States on two occasions. In 2003 Friends of the Everglades and the Miccosukee Indian Tribe argued the {{so-called}} [...] "S-9" [...] lawsuit over the protection of the Everglades. The Supreme Court sent the case back to the District Court to be reargued in the fall of 2004. Current Florida Governor Rick Scott has stated that he favors [...] "restoration, not litigation," [...] which provides a hopeful rallying cry for environmentalists. However, state funding for what is required to prevent and clean chemical pollution in the Everglades is not adequate {{to address the needs of}} the ecosystem. Enforcement of [...] "better management practices" [...] in big sugar farming cuts off the pollution at its source. The state seems willing to negotiate the two sides of the contentious debate, that of big sugar and conservationists, but environmentalists are not convinced that it <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> adequately address the needs of the Everglades.|$|E
2500|$|... "As to Vaikom, I {{think you}} shall let the Hindus do the work. It is they {{who have to}} purify themselves. You can help by your sympathy and your pen, but not by {{organizing}} the Movement and certainly not by offering Satyagraha. If you refer to the Congress resolution of Nagpur, it calls upon the Hindu Members to remove the curse of untouchability. Untouchability is the sin of the Hindus. They must suffer for it; they must pay the debt they owe to their suppressed brothers and sisters. Theirs is the shame and theirs must be the glory when they have purged themselves of the black sin. The silent loving suffering of one pure Hindu as such <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> melt the hearts of millions of Hindus, but the sufferings of thousands of non-Hindus {{on behalf of the}} untouchables will leave the Hindus unmoved. Their blind eyes will not be opened by outside interference, however well intentioned and generous it may be, for it will not bring home to them their sense of guilt. On the contrary, they would probably hug the sin, all the more, for such interference. All reforms to be sincere and lasting must come from within." ...|$|E
