50|$|P. zwierleini {{was first}} {{described}} upon specimens collected around year 1878 near Taormina, in Sicily. Soon after, the species <b>was</b> <b>reported</b> <b>also</b> from Sardinia and near Sorrento in the Italian peninsula. However, despite {{of the large}} size and the distinctive morphological characters, P. zwierleini has been found only rarely. Up to 2017, less than 50 records have been documented. Dedicated field campaigns carried on by different zoologists turned out often unsuccessful, while most records have been obtained by occasional findings by speleologists, amateurs and common citizens.As far as known, P. zwierleini lives in four separate areas of southern Europe: in the southern Iberian Peninsula, between Malaga and Granada; in Sardinia, mainly in the eastern part; in some Tyrrhenian coastal areas of {{the southern part of}} the Italian peninsula, especially the Sorrento peninsula; in Sicily, mainly in the north-eastern part.|$|E

Dominic Breazeale, the American, ranked 6th with the WBO, announced on social media his interests in fighting Parker on late notice. Speculation also grew that number 14 ranked, Razvan Cojanu of Romania would be Parker's replacement. Cojanu, was involved in his training camp in Las Vegas towards the fight. WBC champion Deontay Wilder also called out Parker for a unification bout while Fury's cousin Tyson, the troubled former champion, said he'd be willing to jump in the ring. The following day it was confirmed Cojanu would replace Fury to challenge Parker for the WBO heavyweight belt.

50|$|The drug is in {{decreasing}} use, as it {{was reported}} in 2003 to be associated with a form of heart disease called cardiac fibrosis. In 2007, The United States Food and Drug Administration announced a voluntary withdrawal of the drug by manufacturers due to the possibility of heart valve damage. Pergolide is not currently available in the United States for human use. This problem is thought to be due to pergolide's action at the 5-HT2B serotonin receptors of cardiac myocytes, causing proliferative valve disease by the same mechanism as ergotamine, methysergide, fenfluramine, and other serotonin 5-HT2B agonists, including serotonin itself when elevated in the blood in carcinoid syndrome. Pergolide can rarely cause Raynaud's phenomenon. Among similar antiparkinsonian drugs, cabergoline but not lisuride exhibit this same type of serotonin receptor binding. In January, 2007, cabergoline (Dostinex) <b>was</b> <b>reported</b> <b>also</b> to be associated with valvular proliferation heart damage. In March 2007, pergolide was withdrawn from the U.S. market for human use, due to serious valvular damage that was shown in two independent studies.|$|E

40|$|Damage {{produced}} in n-type silicon by neutron ir-radiation {{at room temperature}} was studied by deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS) and compared with 2 MeV electron damage. The similarities and differ-ences between neutron and electron damage were shown. It was found that point defect character predominated even in the neutron case {{as far as the}} DLTS measure-ments are concerned, and that the same defects as those in the electron case, i. e., the A center, E center and divacancy, were produced by room tempera-ture neutron irradiation. However, the production of the divacancy was important in the neutron damage, while the production of the A center was important in the electron damage. This was attributed to the dif-ference of the energy of the primary knock-ons be-tween neutron and electron irradiation. The forma-tion of several defects during annealing in neutron irradiated n-type silicon <b>was</b> <b>reported</b> <b>also.</b> I...|$|E
30|$|It is {{difficult}} to find particular chromosomal differences enabling the distinction between N. xanthodon and N. ehrenbergi. The studied populations differed in the proportion of bi-armed and uni-armed autosomes and in the number and distribution of NORs. In the population recognized as N. ehrenbergi, the number of detected NORs was five, and a site was localized in an acrocentric autosome. However, it is questionable if such variation {{could be used as a}} species-specific character for reliable species identification. The proportion of the bi-armed and acrocentric autosomes commonly varies between populations of mole rats with the same diploid number of chromosomes (Arslan et al. 2013, 2014) and such variation <b>was</b> <b>reported</b> <b>also</b> in the 52 chromosome race. The previously published karyological data on the 52 chromosome cytotype showed considerable variation also in the C-banding and AgNOR staining pattern, and this variability makes the search for species-specific cytogenetic characters difficult.|$|E

The course development was based on constructivism, especially social constructivism. Major adjustments concerning the structure, contents, and the ways of teaching have been made on this course. The course not only introduced constructivism, but taught according to its principles, letting the teachers construct their teaching knowledge by doing (cooperative problem solving), talking (sharing information and ideas), and writing (journals, reports). Furthermore, the course also had the teachers investigate their own teaching problems. During investigation the teachers have experienced problem searching, planning, and executing action research. Teachers ' learnings were illustrated by excerpts from their journals.
