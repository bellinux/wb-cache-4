5|$|Cherry {{originally}} created Susan as a {{girl next}} door archetype and intended for the character to provide an emotional anchor for the series. When developing the character, Cherry drew upon his personal experiences {{as well as those}} of single <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life. The role was originally written for Mary-Louise Parker, who turned it down; as a result, Hatcher was cast in early 2004. Hatcher's portrayal of the character is both comedic and vulnerable. During the series' debut season, both the character and Hatcher's performance received positive critical reception; however, as the series progressed, the character was received less favorably by critics and fans. Hatcher has received both a Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award for her performance in the series.|$|E
5|$|The {{dispute between}} Norreis and his monks {{dragged on for}} years. The interdict of 1207–1213 caused further delays, {{but when it was}} lifted in 1213 the case against Norreis was finally heard. A papal legate visited the abbey and found that the monks were lacking in food, clothes, and other necessities. The liturgy was not being {{performed}} according to the monastic rule because the monks lacked the proper clothing. Charity to the poor had ceased, the monastic buildings were dilapidated, and the monks were forced to beg for their needs. The legate found that the abbot was living well, wearing non-monastic clothes, and enjoying the company of young <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> dwelling, while his monks suffered. Norreis was deposed from the abbacy by the papal legate in 1213.|$|E
5|$|The prince's {{early death}} (and the later demise of his younger brother) had an {{enormous}} impact on PedroII: on a personal level, on his future conduct as monarch, and on the empire. In his eyes, the deaths of his only sons seemed to presage the end of the imperial system. Although the emperor still had a legal successor in his daughter Isabel, in the male-dominated society of the time he had little confidence that a woman could rule Brazil. He was fond and respectful of the <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life, but he did not consider it feasible that Isabel could survive as monarch. He did nothing to prepare Isabel for the responsibilities of ascending the throne, nor did he attempt to encourage acceptance of a female ruler among the political class.|$|E

25|$|A high {{percentage}} (perhaps over 80%) of all stigmatics are <b>women.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> Stigmata: A Medieval Phenomenon in a Modern Age, Ted Harrison {{suggests that there}} is no single mechanism whereby the marks of stigmata were produced. What is important is that the marks are recognised by others as of religious significance. There have been many cases of fraudulent stigmata.|$|E

Several women have left him due to this and his inability to put their needs before the needs of his family.|$|E

In the same palace, the legitimate Wadiyar king Chamaraja Wodeyar IX was held captive. The prince having no children had adopted his relative, who was also imprisoned by the Sultan. The palaces and temples raised by the earlier Wadiyar kings were also pulled down by Tipu, on the pretext of strengthening the fortress.|$|E
25|$|In The Bad and the Beautiful (1952), {{another of}} his three Oscar-nominated roles, Douglas plays a hard-nosed film {{producer}} who manipulates and uses his actors, writers, and directors. Bacall and Doris Day played two very different types of <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life. In Young Man with a Horn (1950), he played a driven jazz musician, based on real-life horn player Bix Beiderbecke. Composer-pianist Hoagy Carmichael, playing the sidekick role, added realism to the film and gave Douglas insight into the role, being {{a friend of the}} real Beiderbecke.|$|E

Ridgway himself admitted to having a fixation with sex workers, with whom he had a love-hate relationship. He frequently complained about their presence in his neighborhood, but he also took advantage of their services regularly. It has been speculated that Ridgway was torn between his uncontrollable lusts and his staunch religious beliefs.|$|E

25|$|Member states {{appointed}} one Commissioner each (including the President).

From 2004 there were 25 members, raising to 27 from 2007. There were 9 women in the college as of 3 March 2008 and no ethnic minorities, Barroso had stated he wished for more <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> Commission, than in previous Commissions, and he would use his influence over national capitals to gain this.

25|$|Degas's style {{reflects}} his deep {{respect for the}} old masters (he was an enthusiastic copyist well into middle age) and his great admiration for Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Eugène Delacroix. He was also a collector of Japanese prints, whose compositional principles influenced his work, as did the vigorous realism of popular illustrators such as Daumier and Gavarni. Although famous for horses and dancers, Degas began with conventional historical paintings such as The Daughter of Jephthah (c.1859–61) and The Young Spartans (c.1860–62), in which his gradual progress toward a less idealized treatment of the figure is already apparent. During his early career, Degas also painted portraits of individuals and groups; {{an example of the}} latter is The Bellelli Family (c.1858–67), a brilliantly composed and psychologically poignant portrayal of his aunt, her husband, and their children. In this painting, as in The Young Spartans and many later works, Degas was drawn to the tensions present between men and <b>women.</b> <b>In</b> <b>his</b> early paintings, Degas already evidenced the mature style that he would later develop more fully by cropping subjects awkwardly and by choosing unusual viewpoints.|$|E
25|$|Grant often {{displayed}} laddish, thrill-seeking behaviour; drinking, chasing women, clubbing, {{gambling and}} living {{off of his}} wits. He became restless easily and actively sought the thrill of danger in order to regain excitement in his life, which led to his participation in numerous crimes, fights and affairs. Grant showed sociopathic tendencies at times — impulsive behaviour, a disregard for social rules and an indifference to the feelings of others, particularly the <b>women</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> life. He was often portrayed as arrogant and egotistical, with an inflated opinion of his own importance. Because of this, he rarely admitted to being at fault or backed down from an argument. While the character mellowed in his later years, such behaviour was still apparent. However he is not completely without showing rare signs of compassion. An example of this {{was that he was}} one of the few people who offered support to Mark Fowler when he was isolated by the rest of Albert Square (led ironically by Grant's mother, Peggy), because of his HIV illness.|$|E
