His oldest son, William Arturo Muñoz made his wrestling debut in 2008 and when he signed with CMLL in 2009 Muñoz accompanied his son for his introduction, {{making it clear that}} Rush (Wiliam's rig name) was the son of Toro Blanco and played up the second generation wrestler.

50|$|The {{main event}} {{was the third}} week in a row that Los Ingobernables had faced some {{combination}} of wrestlers form Los Guerreros Lagunero and the second week in a row that La Máscara, La Sombra and Rush faced Gran Guerrero, Niebla Roja and Último Guerrero specifically {{as part of a}} longer-running storyline between the two factions. Los Ingobernables came to the ring wearing creepy masks, hoodies and pants instead of their normal wrestling gear, giving the impression of more of a street gang than a wrestling team. The majority of the in ring action centered around Último Guerrero and Rush as they focused primarily on each other through out the match, building to the already announced singles match between the two the following week. In the third and deciding fall La Máscara and La Sombra held Último Guerrero still, allowing Rush to run across the ring and land a foul kick on Último Guerrero in front of the referee. This led to the disqualification loss for Los Ingobernables, but the trio showed once again that they cared less about winning the match and more about inflicting pain on their opponents. Over the years Volador Jr. has made it a habit to sometimes <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> gear that resembles various super heroes, a tradition he continued in the semi-main event as he came to the ring looking like Spider-Man as he appeared on the Future Foundation storyline. Volador Jr. teamed up with Titán and Valiente, only to lose to the trio known as La Fuerza TRT ("The TRT Power"; El Terrible, Rey Bucanero and Vangelis) who win the first and the last fall to win the whole match. The fourth match of the evening was a match type called a Match Relampago ("Lighting Match"), a one fall match with a 10 minute time limit. The Lighting Match saw former rivals Máximo and Rey Escorpión face off, playing off a longer-running storyline between the two. On August 18, 2013 Rey Escorpión defeated Máximos father Brazo de Plata in a Lucha de Apuestas, or bet match, after which Brazo de Plata was shaved bald as a result. Brazo de Plata lost when Máximo tried to interfere and it cost his father the match. In subsequent months the feud moved on to Máximo trying to get revenge for his father against Rey Escorpión. The storyline included a match for Rey Escorpións CMLL World Light Heavyweight Championship, won by against Máximo. In the months following the title match the focus seemed to shift away from their rivalry, but on October 25 it was rekindled as the two fought a very intense match, won by Máximo, followed by him making challenges for Rey Escorpións championship once more. Like Volador Jr., the rudo ("the Bad guy") Mephisto had on several occasions patterened his ring gear on characters from comic books, in his case particularly super villains. For the October 25 show Mephisto wrestled in an outfit and mask that resembled a Zombie Batman character. Mephisto teamed up with regular partner Ephesto and a man who was starting to team with the two more and more, Hechicero as the team took on rookie Dragon Lee and two-thirds of Los Reyes de la Atlantida ("The kings of the Atlantis"; Delta and Guerrero Maya, Jr.). The teams split the first two falls between them in quick fashion, while the third fall was the longest of the match, longer than the first two falls combined, and saw Hechicero and Guerrero Maya, Jr. square off on several occasions, possibly sowing the seeds for a future storyline.|$|E

The {{purpose of the}} <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> is to limit the leakage of fluid from the high pressure zone at the impeller outlet to the low pressure region at the impeller inlet. Several different <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> geometries may be employed for this purpose. The choice of which geometry is utilized depends on {{which of the following}} goals are ranked most important: ? Pump efficiency ? Rotor dynamic coefficients: stiffness and damping ? Preventing contact during thermal or suction transients ? Resistance to wear from abrasive particles ? Allow later adjustment to recover original clearances as the pump wears There have been many papers published on the effect of <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> geometry on leakage, efficiency and rotor dynamic coefficients. However little is known about how specific <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> geometries affect the suction performance of an impeller. This paper seeks to examine several different <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> geometries in common use. It will then quantify how each of these geometries affects the suction performance of the impeller over the full design flow range.

40|$|The leakage flow {{paths in}} the {{sidewall}} gaps of centrifugal pumps are of significant importance for numbers of effects. The paper {{is concerned with}} the transient flow in the leakage flow paths with <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> clearance variation. For this purpose, numerical simulations of the whole pump were carried out. The grid dependence and yplus check were performed first. Additionally, experimental data of performance characteristic and pressure fluctuation inside the sidewall gap was used to validate the numerical results. The transient velocity fields inside the sidewall gaps during one blade passage period were simulated. And the leakage through the <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> gap was obtained for all operating points investigated. To have a better idea of attenuation and propagation of pressure inside the sidewall gap, the unsteady pressure distributions in the gap were calculated. Additionally, the surfaces of the impeller were divided into four parts. The fluid force on each part was expressed {{as a percentage of the}} total radial force. Through comparing the flow fields, the pressure distributions, and the radial force between the pumps with different <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> clearances, the effects of the <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> clearance were discussed in detail. The results can be used to guide the optimum design of the pump sidewall gaps...|$|E

Although their application {{dates back to}} the industrial revolution, their bending behavior under compression is typically addressed by simple Euler’s instability analysis on the rod, neglecting effects such as the cylinder inertia and stiffness, the presence of contact elements in the cylinder-rod junction and on the piston, geometrical misalignments and imperfections, and friction moments at the support. Such simplifications lead to unjustified reduced critical load calculations on the component. In the present paper, a complete mathematical formulation, which accounts for such effects, is presented and validated against experimental data. A numerical sensitivity analysis is conducted, to assess the contributions of initial rectilinear imperfections, wear rings stiffness and dimension, and supports friction on the actuator’s limit buckling load and bending behavior under compression. Results are presented, including the effect of the cited parameters on the buckling load, providing a reliable tool for the mechanical designer. In particular, an optimum position for the <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> distance is found. Moreover, increased <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> stiffness and reduced imperfections increase the buckling load and reduce the bending stresses before the critical load...|$|E

40|$|Bearing {{materials}} {{for use in}} the Metallurgy Division Sector of the EBR- 11 Fuel Cycle Plant must operate without lubrication in an argon atmosphere of low humidity (dew-point of [...] 50 deg C or less) and high gamma activity. To select suitable materials, a test program, in which samples of materials known to be radiation resistant were tested for wear resistance in an argon atmosphere containing less than 30 ppm water by volume, was initiated. The criterion by which wear resistance was judged is loss in sample weight over a 24 -hour abrasion period during which the samples rub along the periphery of a 2 1 / 2 -in. OD <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> made of SAE 1045 steel. The majority of the samples were tested using a load of 2755 gm and a rubbing vclocity of 109 ft per sec.

Of the materials tested, Reactor Grade Graphite and some graphite derivatives showed the best bearing qualities.

40|$|Fig. 17 Hydrostatic journal seal wafer {{flow data}} {{correlation}} with esti-mated flows {{of the latter}} two curves is that the test seal had an initial radial clearance of 0. 0024 in. and was analyzed {{to result in a}} running clearance of 0. 0014 in. at a 2500 -psi pressure differential and 30, 000 rpm. The significance of the 0. 0008 -in. clearance curve is that, with design optimizing the seal cross section, it is expected that the seal flexibility could be increased, thereby resulting in a running clearance and thus a leakage flow comparable to those of a rigid seal with only 0. 0008 -in. clearance from an initial clearance of about 0. 0025 in.

Axial and radial loads, head and efficiency versus flow, and cavitation tests were conducted. Predicted performance of two pumps are compared when pumping water and liquid hydrogen. Detailed pressure loss and parasitic power values are presented for two pump configurations. Partial-emission diffusers were found to permit use of larger impeller and diffuser passages with a minimal performance penalty.

The most significant results were obtained from proximity probes located in the bearing bore which revealed large subsynchronous precession at ten percent of shaft speed during engine start which subsided prior to mainstage power levels and reappeared during engine shutdown at equivalent power levels below 65 % of nominal. This phenomenon has been attributed to rotating stall in the diffuser. The proximity probes also revealed the location of the bearing in the bore for different operating speeds. Pump vibration characteristics were improved as compared to pumps tested with ball bearings.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{of using a}} two-stage unshrouded impeller turbopump to replace the current three-stage reusable launch vehicle engine shrouded impeller hydrogen pump has been evaluated {{from the standpoint of}} turbopump weight reduction and overall payload improvement. These advantages are a by-product of the higher tip speeds that an unshrouded impeller can sustain. The issues associated with the effect of unshrouded impeller tip clearance on pump efficiency and head have been evaluated with one-dimensional tools and full three-dimensional rotordynamic fluid reaction forces and coefficients have been established through time dependent computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of the whole 360 degree impeller with different rotor eccentricities and whirling ratios. Unlike the shrouded impeller, the unshrouded impeller forces are evaluated as the sum of the pressure forces on the blade and the pressure forces on the hub using the CFD results. The turbopump axial thrust control has been optimized by adjusting the first stage impeller backend <b>wear</b> <b>ring</b> seal diameter and diverting the second stage backend balance piston flow to the proper location. The structural integrity associated with the high tip speed has been checked by analyzing a 3 D-Finite Element Model at maximum design conditions (6 % higher than the design speed).
