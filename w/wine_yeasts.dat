2500|$|All {{lactic acid}} {{bacteria}} (LAB) involved in winemaking, whether as a positive contributor or {{as a source for}} potential faults, have the ability to produce lactic acid through the metabolism of a sugar source, as well as the metabolism of L-malic acid.

Some bacteria species use the sugars through a homofermentative pathway, meaning [...] only one main end product (usually lactate) is produced, while others use heterofermentative pathways that can create multiple end products such as carbon dioxide, ethanol, and acetate. While only the L-isomer of lactate is produced by LAB in the conversion of malic acid, both hetero- and homofermenters can produce D-, L- and DL-isomers of lactic from glucose which may contribute to slightly different sensory properties in the wine.|$|E

The benefits derived from interspecific hybridisation include {{the potential of}} generating advantageous transgressive phenotypes. This paper describes the generation of {{a new breed of}} <b>wine</b> <b>yeast</b> by interspecific hybridisation between a commercial Saccharomyces cerevisiae <b>wine</b> <b>yeast</b> strain and Saccharomyces mikatae, a species hitherto not associated with industrial fermentation environs. While commercially available <b>wine</b> <b>yeast</b> strains provide consistent and reliable fermentations, wines produced using single inocula are thought to lack the sensory complexity and rounded palate structure obtained from spontaneous fermentations. In contrast, interspecific yeast hybrids have the potential to deliver increased complexity to wine sensory properties and alternative wine styles through the formation of novel, and wider ranging, yeast volatile fermentation metabolite profiles, whilst maintaining the robustness of the <b>wine</b> <b>yeast</b> parent. Screening of newly generated hybrids from a cross between a S. cerevisiae <b>wine</b> <b>yeast</b> and S. mikatae (closely-related but ecologically distant members of the Saccharomyces sensu stricto clade), has identified progeny with robust fermentation properties and winemaking potential. Chemical analysis showed that, relative to the S. cerevisiae <b>wine</b> <b>yeast</b> parent, hybrids produced wines with different concentrations of volatile metabolites that are known to contribute to wine flavour and aroma, including flavour compounds associated with non-Saccharomyces species. The new S. cerevisiae x S. mikatae hybrids have the potential to produce complex wines akin to products of spontaneous fermentation while giving winemakers the safeguard of an inoculated ferment.

2500|$|The primary {{fermentation}} of {{sparkling wine}} begins {{like most other}} wines, though winemakers may choose to use specially cultivated sparkling <b>wine</b> <b>yeasts.</b> The wines may go through malolactic fermentation, though producers wishing to make fruitier, simpler wines will usually forgo this step. After fermentation the base wines are then blended to form a cuvee. While there are examples of varietal sparkling wines, such as blanc de blancs (white of whites) made from 100% Chardonnay, most sparkling wines are blends of several grape varieties, vineyards and vintages. Producers with wide access to grapes will use wines from several hundred base wines to create a blend that reflect the [...] "house style" [...] of their non-vintage wine. It is through the initiation of a secondary fermentation that distinguishes sparkling wine production and gives the wine its characteristic [...] "bubbles". One of the by products of fermentation {{is the creation of}} carbon dioxide gas. While this gas is able to be released during the first fermentation, efforts are taken during the second fermentation to retain the gas and have it dissolve into the wine. This creates a high pressure within the wine bottle (on average around 5 atmospheres) and wine producers take care to package the wine in strong glass bottles. When the wine is open and poured into a glass, the gas is released and the wine becomes sparkling.|$|E

Nitrogen substrate abundance in grape must failed to correlate with the rate or the efficiency of nitrogen source utilization, but well predicted lag phase length. Thus, human domestication of yeast for grape must growth has had, at the most, a marginal impact on <b>wine</b> <b>yeast</b> growth rates and efficiencies, but may have left a surprising imprint on {{the time required to}} adjust metabolism from non growth to growth. <b>Wine</b> <b>yeast</b> nitrogen source utilization deviated from that of the lab strain experimentation, but also varied between wine strains.

We also identified candidate causative mutations in these genes. The methionine defect of PDM is potentially very interesting as the strain can, in some circumstances, overproduce foul tasting H 2 S, a trait which likely stems from insufficient methionine catabolization.

40|$|Due to the {{importance}} of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in wine-making, the genomic variation of <b>wine</b> <b>yeast</b> strains has been extensively studied. One of the major insights stemming from these studies is that <b>wine</b> <b>yeast</b> strains harbor low levels of genetic diversity in the form of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Genomic structural variants, such as copy number (CN) variants, are another major type of variation segregating in natural populations. To test whether genetic diversity in CN variation is also low across <b>wine</b> <b>yeast</b> strains, we examined genome-wide levels of CN variation in 132 whole-genome sequences of S. cerevisiae wine strains. We found an average of 97. 8 CN variable regions (CNVRs) affecting ∼ 4 % of the genome per strain. Using two different measures of CN diversity, we found that gene families involved in fermentation-related processes such as copper resistance (CUP), flocculation (FLO), and glucose metabolism (HXT), as well as the SNO gene family whose members are expressed before or during the diauxic shift, showed substantial CN diversity across the 132 strains examined. Importantly, these same gene families have been shown, through comparative transcriptomic and functional assays, to be associated with adaptation to the wine fermentation environment.

50|$|For both types, yeast {{is fully}} {{distributed}} through the beer {{while it is}} fermenting, and both equally flocculate (clump together and precipitate {{to the bottom of}} the vessel) when fermentation is finished. By no means do all top-cropping yeasts demonstrate this behaviour, but it features strongly in many English yeasts that may also exhibit chain forming (the failure of budded cells to break from the mother cell), which is in the technical sense different from true flocculation. The most common top-cropping brewer's yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is the same species as the common baking yeast. However, baking and brewing yeasts typically belong to different strains, cultivated to favour different characteristics: baking yeast strains are more aggressive, in order to carbonate dough in the shortest amount of time; brewing yeast strains act slower, but tend to tolerate higher alcohol concentrations (normally 12-15% abv is the maximum, though under special treatment some ethanol-tolerant strains can be coaxed up to around 20%). Modern quantitative genomics has revealed the complexity of Saccharomyces species to the extent that yeasts involved in beer and wine production commonly involve hybrids of so-called pure species. As such, the yeasts involved in what has been typically called top-cropping or top-fermenting ale may be both Saccharomyces cerevisiae and complex hybrids of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces kudriavzevii. Three notable ales, Chimay, Orval and Westmalle, are fermented with these hybrid strains, which are identical to <b>wine</b> <b>yeasts</b> from Switzerland.|$|E

The {{discrimination}} between <b>wine</b> <b>yeast</b> strains as well {{as between}} their fermented wines has been investigated in this pilot study. The study was divided in two parts, the first to investigate the discrimination between wines fermented with five different Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains, analysed by gas chromatography (GC) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and the second part to investigate discrimination between <b>wine</b> <b>yeast</b> strains in different liquid media and in dried form using FTIR in transmission and attenuated total reflectance (ATR) modes. Wines from three cultivars (Clairette Blanche, Pinotage and Cabernet Sauvignon) that were fermented by five Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast strains (VIN 13, WE 372, VIN 13 -EXS, VIN 13 -PPK and ML 01) were analysed by GC and FTIR. This analysis was done on individual sample sets that consisted of the wines of each of the mentioned cultivars and also on samples drawn throughout the ageing process of these wines. The data obtained were analysed by PLS-Discrimination (PLS-discrim), a chemometric method. Using the data from both the analytical methods, discrimination was observed between wines fermented with different yeast strains in each of the two vintages (2005 and 2006) for all the cultivars. When combining the data from the two vintages no discrimination could be observed between the fermented wines. The discrimination of the fermented wines was found to be similar when using data from GC and FTIR, respectively. Since analysis with FTIR is considerably faster than analysis by GC, it would be recommended that FTIR is used for future studies of similar nature. Combining the samples into one set consisting of wines fermented with commercial <b>wine</b> <b>yeast</b> strains and <b>wines</b> fermented from closely related <b>wine</b> <b>yeast</b> strains (the parental strain and two genetically modified versions thereof (VIN 13, VIN 13 -EXS and VIN 13 - PPK), those fermented with closely related stains did not show good discrimination from each other.

We evaluated <b>wine</b> <b>yeast</b> strains with different glucose and fructose consumption rates to show that a lower glucose preference correlates with a higher fructose/glucose phosphorylation ratio in cell extracts and a lower K (m) for both sugars. Hxk 1 has a threefold higher V (max) with fructose than with glucose, whereas Hxk 2 has only a slightly higher V (max) with glucose than with fructose. Overexpression of HXK 1 in a laboratory strain of S. cerevisiae (W 303 - 1 A) accelerated fructose consumption more than glucose consumption, but overexpression in a <b>wine</b> <b>yeast</b> strain (VIN 13) reduced fructose consumption less than glucose consumption. Results with laboratory strains expressing a single kinase showed that total hexokinase activity is inversely correlated with the glucose/fructose (G/F) discrepancy.

On the one hand, certain sulfur-containing volatile compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, imparting a rotten egg-like aroma, can {{have a negative impact}} on the perceived quality of the wine, and on the other hand, some sulfur compounds such as 3 -mercaptohexanol, imparting fruitiness, can have a positive impact on wine flavor and aroma.

The <b>wine</b> <b>yeast</b> Saccharomyces cerevisiae plays a central role in the production of volatile sulfur compounds. Through the sulfate reduction sequence pathway, the HS- is formed, which can lead to the formation of hydrogen sulfide and various mercaptan compounds. Therefore, limiting the formation of the HS- ion is an important target in metabolic engineering of <b>wine</b> <b>yeast.</b> The <b>wine</b> <b>yeast</b> is also responsible for the transformation of non-volatile sulfur precursors, present in the grape, to volatile, flavor-active thiol compounds.
