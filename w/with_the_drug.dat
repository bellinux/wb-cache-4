5|$|An {{epilogue}} flashback scene soon {{reveals that}} Kelso {{had known about}} the stolen morphine and Sheldon's involvement, after they and their other fellow Marines found the surplus supply on their ship home. However, Kelso refused {{to be involved in}} Sheldon's scheme to sell the drugs along with the other Marines, telling them all that they will lose his respect for them as Marines if they go through <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> profiting, setting in motion the events of the game.|$|E

40|$|Four nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} analgesic drugs acetylsall-cylic acid (aspirin), salicylic acid, indomethacin and piroxicam {{were tested}} for their action on chloride/bicarbonate exchange by anion antiport {{and on the}} regulation of cytosohc pH (pH) in Vero cells. The Na-independent CI/HC 03 exchange regulates pH back to normal after alkalinization and is therefore {{in a state of}} high activity at alkaline pH, whereas it {{is in a state of}} low activity when pH is below neutrality. Preincubation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>drugs</b> at low pH strongly increased the activity of the Na-independent Ct/HCO 3 exchange, whereas at high pH the antiport was inhibited. The Na-dependent Cl/HCO 3 exchange, which is most active at low pH and normalize pH after acidification, was inhibited after preincubation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>drugs.</b> In cells that had been incubated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>drugs,</b> pH was 0. 1 to 0. 4 pH units lowe...|$|R
5|$|The M3 subtype of AML, {{also known}} as acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), is almost universally treated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in {{addition}} to induction chemotherapy, usually an anthracycline. Care {{must be taken to}} prevent disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), complicating the treatment of APL when the promyelocytes release the contents of their granules into the peripheral circulation. APL is eminently curable, with well-documented treatment protocols.|$|E
5|$|The {{condition}} {{is difficult to}} treat, and may involve fillings, fluoride to fight tooth decay and drugs that increase saliva for dry mouth, as well as oral hygiene instruction. It can be medically dangerous for active methamphetamine users because of the cardiac problems that can result from the interaction of local anesthetic <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{ketogenic}} diet {{is usually}} initiated {{in combination with}} the patient's existing anticonvulsant regimen, though patients may be weaned off anticonvulsants if the diet is successful. There is some evidence of synergistic benefits when the diet is combined with the vagus nerve stimulator or <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> zonisamide, and that the diet may be less successful in children receiving phenobarbital.|$|E

5|$|After {{an episode}} of {{pituitary}} apoplexy, 80% of people develop hypopituitarism and require some form of hormone replacement therapy. The most common problem is growth hormone deficiency, which is often left untreated but may cause decreased muscle mass and strength, obesity and fatigue. 60–80% require hydrocortisone replacement (either permanently or when unwell), 50–60% need thyroid hormone replacement, and 60–80% of men require testosterone supplements. Finally, 10–25% develop diabetes insipidus, the inability to retain fluid in the kidneys {{due to a lack}} of the pituitary antidiuretic hormone. This may be treated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> desmopressin, which can be applied as a nose spray or taken by mouth.|$|E
5|$|Boyd had {{her first}} {{encounter}} with LSD in early 1965 when the couple's dentist, John Riley, secretly laced her coffee <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> during a dinner party at his home. As she {{was getting ready to}} leave with Harrison and John and Cynthia Lennon, Riley told them that he had spiked their drinks and tried to persuade them to stay. Outside, Boyd was in an agitated state from the drug and threatened to break a store window, but Harrison pulled her away. Later, when Boyd and her group were in a lift on their way up to the Ad Lib club, they mistakenly believed it was on fire.|$|E
5|$|Drug use {{is often}} portrayed in {{conjunction}} with the hippie subculture, through hippie characters, such as the two teenagers that give LSD to Mackey, and the woman that he befriends and eventually marries. Jimbo and Cartman both use the term hippie pejoratively. During their argument, Jimbo tells Mackey that he should just go to a Grateful Dead concert, to which Mackey says he can't since Jerry Garcia is deceased. On two occasions, the episode shows people watching Teletubbies while high on marijuana or in rehab. In his drug prevention speech, Mackey claims that LSD was made famous by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, former members of The Beatles. Both Lennon and McCartney are known to have experimented <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug.</b>|$|E

5|$|Writer Ed Burns, {{who worked}} as a public school teacher after {{retiring}} from the Baltimore police force shortly before going to work with Simon, has called education the theme of the fourth season. Rather than focusing solely on the school system, the fourth season looks at schools as a porous part of the community that are affected by problems outside of their boundaries. Burns states that education comes from many sources other than schools and that children can be educated by other means, including contact <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> dealers they work for. Burns and Simon see the theme as an opportunity to explore how individuals end up like the show's criminal characters, and to dramatize the notion that hard work is not always justly rewarded.|$|E

25|$|In solid-organ {{transplant}}ation, ischemia-reperfusion injury {{can occur}} when blood returns to tissue {{for the first}} time in the transplant recipient. A major contributor to tissue damage results from activation of regulated necroptosis, which could include contributions from both necroptosis and mitochondrial permeability transition. Treatment <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> cyclosporine, which represses the mitochondrial permeability transition effector Cyclophilin D, improves tissue survival primarily by inhibiting necrotic cell death, rather than its additional function as an immunosuppressant.|$|E
25|$|In-feed {{treatments}} {{are easier to}} administer and pose less environmental risk than bath treatments. Feed is usually coated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> and drug distribution to the parasite {{is dependent on the}} pharmacokinetics of the drug getting in sufficient quantity to the parasite. The drugs have high selective toxicity for the parasite, are quite lipid-soluble so that there is sufficient drug to act for approximately 2 months, and any unmetabolized drug is excreted so slowly that there are little to no environmental concerns.|$|E

50|$|The {{most common}} adverse effect of EGFR inhibitors, found {{in more than}} 90% of patients, is a papulopustular rash that spreads across the face and torso; the rash's {{presence}} is correlated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug's</b> antitumor effect. In 10% to 15% of patients the effects can be serious and require treatment.|$|R
40|$|Antibiotic {{pharmacokinetics}} (PK) {{is concerned}} <b>with</b> <b>the</b> dis-position of <b>drugs</b> in <b>the</b> body. Antimicrobial pharmacokinetics is concerned <b>with</b> absorption when <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> has an oral form and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>drug’s</b> bioavailability. When antimicrobial agents are given intravenously, {{the rate of}} the antibiotic infusion de-termines peak serum concentrations. Peak serum concentra-tions fall briefly and rapidly during the alpha phase of elimi-nation. Shortly thereafter, the beta terminal phase of elimination is a constant decrease in antimicrobial serum concentrations over time as <b>the</b> <b>drug</b> is excreted. It is the beta phase of elim-ination of an antimicrobial that determines its serum half-life (t 1 / 2). The half-life is {{the amount of time that}} halves the con-centration of a <b>drug</b> in <b>the</b> serum. After an antimicrobial agent is absorbed into the blood-stream by any route, it is reversibly bound to serum albumin...|$|R
