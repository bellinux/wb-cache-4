Writers told me, 'Boy, you really {{gave it to the}} producers.' Producers told me, 'Boy, you really stuck it to the {{networks}}.' The networks told me, 'Boy, you really hammered the studios.' Nobody got to the point. I was indicting all of us. What is frustrating about this is nothing has changed. Everybody wants to do everything the way it has been done 100 times before." ...|$|E
500|$|Director Jeunet {{wanted to}} display Ripley's new powers, {{including}} {{a scene in}} which Ripley throws a basketball through a hoop while facing the opposite direction. Weaver trained for ten days and averaged one out of six baskets, although the distance required for filming was farther than she had practiced. Jeunet was concerned about the time being spent on the shot and wanted to either use a machine to throw the ball or to insert it later using computer-generated imagery (CGI). Weaver, however, was determined to make the shot authentic, and insisted on doing it herself. The shot required many dozens of takes, during which none of the balls went in. The crew <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up, but gave Weaver one last shot, and in this take, she got the ball in perfectly; the idea that she did it in one take is a myth. The ball was out of frame for a moment during the shot, and Pitof offered to edit it so that the ball was on-screen for the entire scene, but Weaver refused. Ron Perlman broke character when she made the basket, and turned to the camera to say [...] "Oh my god!" [...] There was enough of a pause between Weaver's basket and Perlman's statement for the film's editors to cut the scene accordingly during post-production.|$|E
2500|$|Burns and Paul were enraged, {{but after}} coming so close {{there was no}} chance that they <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> up now. They resumed their protests at the White House on August 6, 1918. [...] Once again the women were jailed, exposed to horrendous conditions, and {{released}} shortly thereafter. [...] Their focus then was moved to helping pro-suffrage candidates get elected in November. [...] For the first time the NWP did not give allegiance to one party over another; they supported anyone who was willing to support suffrage, and this cost the Democrats their majority in Congress.|$|E

50|$|What {{lies ahead}} of evangelicalism {{if it does}} not correct its path <b>is</b> it <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> birth <b>to</b> a new liberalism. If (the {{alliance}} of Confessing Evangelicals - the framers of the Cambridge Declaration) is effective, on the other hand, it <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> birth <b>to</b> a new focussed resurgence of reformational Christianity. These two paths will become the alternatives between which people <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have to choose.|$|R
