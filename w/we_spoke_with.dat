It provided $ 787 billion in spending and tax provisions; {{more than a third}} of the money was slated for projects and activities, including construction and certain research projects. To implement a project using federal funds, agencies and funding recipients must comply with federal laws and regulations. GAO was asked to identify key federal requirements that apply to Recovery Act projects and to assess the extent to which (1) selected agencies have obligated and spent funds for Recovery Act projects and (2) federal requirements and other factors have affected, or are expected to affect, project selection and start dates. GAO requested data from 27 agencies that received appropriations under the act. <b>We</b> also <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> officials responsible for implementing Recovery Act projects in 16 states and the District of Columbia, which together are estimated to receive about two-thirds of the intergovernmental federal assistance available under the act. <b>We</b> also <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> organizations representing state and local officials and the private sector, as well as private sector contractors.

2500|$|As media {{coverage}} widened and intensified, CBS at first attempted to produce additional {{evidence to support}} its claims. On September 11, a CBS News segment stated that document expert Phillip Bouffard thought the documents [...] "could have been prepared on an IBM Selectric Composer typewriter, available at the time." [...] The Selectric Composer was introduced in 1966 for use by typesetting professionals to generate camera-ready copy; according to IBM archives describing this specialized equipment, [...] "To produce copy which can be reproduced with 'justified', or straight left-and right-hand margins, the operator types the copy once and the composer computes the number of spaces needed to justify the line. As the operator types the copy a second time, the spaces are added automatically.") Bouffard's comments were also cited by the Boston Globe in an article entitled [...] "Authenticity backed on Bush documents." [...] However, the Globe soon printed a retraction regarding the title.

40|$|JSC {{has used}} E- 85 {{as part of}} an overall {{strategy}} to comply with Presidential Executive Order 13423 and the Energy Policy Act. As a Federal fleet, we are required to reduce our petroleum consumption by 2 percent per year, and increase the use of alternative fuels in our vehicles. With the opening of our onsite dispenser in October 2004, JSC became the second federal fleet in Texas and the fifth NASA center to add E- 85 fueling capability. JSC has {{a relatively small number of}} GSA Flex Fuel fleet vehicles at the present time (we don't include personal vehicles, or other contractor's non-GSA fleet), and there were no reasonably available retail E- 85 fuel stations within a 15 -minute drive or within five miles (one way). So we decided to install a small 1000 gallon onsite tank and dispenser. It was difficult to obtain a supplier due to our low monthly fuel consumption, and our fuel supplier contract has changed three times in less than five years. We experiences a couple of fuel contamination and quality control issues.

60|$|Adjoining the drawing-room is the dining-room, in {{one corner}} of which, between two windows, Scott died. It was now {{a quarter of a century}} since his death; but it seemed to me that <b>we</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> a sort of hush in our voices, as if he were still dying here, or had but just departed. I {{remember}} nothing else in this room. The next one is the armory, which is the smallest of all that we had passed through; but its walls gleam with the steel blades of swords, and the barrels of pistols, matchlocks, firelocks, and all manner of deadly weapons, whether European or Oriental; for there are many trophies here of East Indian warfare. I saw Rob Roy's gun, rifled and of very large bore; and a beautiful pistol, formerly Claverhouse's; and the sword of Montrose, given him by King Charles, the silver hilt of which I grasped. There was also a superb claymore, in an elaborately wrought silver sheath, made for Sir Walter Scott, and presented to him by the Highland Society, for his services in marshalling the clans when George IV. came to Scotland. There were a thousand other things, which I knew must be most curious, yet did not ask nor care about them, because so many curiosities drive one crazy, and fret one's heart to death. On the whole, there is no simple and great impression left by Abbotsford; and I felt angry and dissatisfied with myself for not feeling something which I did not and could not feel. But it is just like going to a museum, if you look into particulars; and one learns from it, too, that Scott could not have been really a wise man, nor an earnest one, nor one that grasped the truth of life; he did but play, and the play grew very sad toward its close. In a certain way, however, I understand his romances the better for having seen his house; and his house the better for having read his romances. They throw light on one another.|$|E
60|$|At nine in {{the morning}} the caravan was before the hotel door and we were at breakfast. There was a commotion about the place. Rumors of war and bloodshed were flying every where. The lawless Bedouins in the Valley of the Jordan and the deserts down by the Dead Sea were up in arms, and were going to destroy all comers. They had had a battle with a troop of Turkish cavalry and {{defeated}} them; several men killed. They had shut up the inhabitants of a village and a Turkish garrison in an old fort near Jericho, and were besieging them. They had marched upon a camp of our excursionists by the Jordan, and the pilgrims only saved their lives by stealing away and flying to Jerusalem under whip and spur {{in the darkness of the}} night. Another of our parties had been fired on from an ambush and then attacked in the open day. Shots were fired on both sides. Fortunately there was no bloodshed. <b>We</b> <b>spoke</b> <b>with</b> the very pilgrim who had fired one of the shots, and learned from his own lips how, in this imminent deadly peril, only the cool courage of the pilgrims, their strength of numbers and imposing display of war material, had saved them from utter destruction. It was reported that the Consul had requested that no more of our pilgrims should go to the Jordan while this state of things lasted; and further, that he was unwilling that any more should go, at least without an unusually strong military guard. Here was trouble. But with the horses at the door and every body aware of what they were there for, what would you have done? Acknowledged that you were afraid, and backed shamefully out? Hardly. It would not be human nature, where there were so many women. You would have done as we did: said you were not afraid of a million Bedouins--and made your will and proposed quietly to yourself to take up an unostentatious position in the rear of the procession.|$|E
60|$|In {{his early}} days he had fought against Poles, Bohemians and others, as Imperial general.

That inextricable Hungarian-Bohemian-Polish DONNYBROOK (so we may call it) which Austria had on hand, one of Sigismund's bequests to Austria; distressingly tumultuous Donnybrook, which goes from 1440 to 1471, fighting in a fierce confused manner;--the Anti-Turk Hunniades, the Anti-Austrian Corvinus, the royal Majesties George Podiebrad, Ladislaus POSTHUMUS, Ludwig OHNE HAUT (Ludwig NO-SKIN), and other Ludwigs, Ladislauses and Vladislauses, striking and getting struck at such a rate:--Albert was generally what we may call chief-constable in all that; giving a knock here and then one there, in the Kaiser's name. [Hormayr, ii. 138, 140 (? HUNYADY CORVIN); Rentsch, pp. 389-422; Michaelis, i. 304-313.] Almost from boyhood, he had learned soldiering, which he had never afterwards leisure to forget.

40|$|We are {{forwarding}} {{our review}} of available information on the toxicity and persistence of decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D 5), a proposed alternative for perchloroethylene in dry cleaning.

In response to your request to evaluate available information on the toxicity of D 5 under the statutory mandate, OEHHA staff have reviewed information submitted by the Silicones Environmental Health and Safety Council (SEHSC), including studies evaluating acute and subchronic toxicity, neuroendocrine activity, estrogenicity, genotoxicity, chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity and related mode of action studies, and pharmacokinetics. In addition, we evaluated an SEHSC white paper summarizing the toxicity of D 5, and an exposure assessment conducted by Environ Corporation for SEHSC. We also searched the open literature for additional information, including government documents from other countries, and identified additional information on human exposure, environmental persistence and accumulation in biota. As requested by ARB, we focused on evaluating the applicability of the SEHSC-proposed mechanism of action of tumor formation in rodents to human health risk assessment. Our review of the available information is attached. In the process of reviewing the information, we met three times with the SEHSC representatives, including their toxicologists.
