500|$|Leeds midfielder Albert Johanneson {{would become}} the first black player to play in an FA Cup final. However, before walking out onto the pitch Johanneson {{suffered}} racial abuse: â€œWhen <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out,</b> all I could hear was a cacophony of Zulu-like noises coming from the terraces. It was dreadful, I could barely hear myself think for those screams. I wanted to run back down the tunnel." ...|$|E
60|$|He was wearied {{with the}} {{fatigues}} of the day, and, as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out,</b> {{fell into a}} fit of gloomy musing.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not answer}} that, but called for a reckoning; and taking my arm again, <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> past the {{sleeping}} houses.|$|E
6000|$|She made no answer, and he {{saw that}} her eyes were filling with tears; so he added, 'Suppose <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> a little; Sir Christopher and my lady seem to be occupied.' ...|$|R
6000|$|RENCH. All right--I guess we're {{wasting time}} here, boys. <b>We</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> and stay out. (Threateningly.) Not a shaft'll turn over in them shops until you {{recognize}} the union. And if that's treason, {{go back to}} Washington and tell 'em so. Come on boys! ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{wonder what}} he fears. I should fear nothing,--nothing. Why should not <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> of the house, and be married any way? Nobody {{has a right to}} stop me. Papa could only turn me out of his house. I will venture if he will.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We didn't go {{into the}} city until the sky was full of stars, so <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> upon the high terrace, to and fro, and--she counselled me to go back.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> to {{the landing}} and, {{descending}} the stairs, reached the street {{and stepped into the}} motor car that was waiting for us. It rolled off and turned into Piccadilly.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{did not go}} {{into the}} city until the sky was full of stars, so <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> upon the high terrace, to and fro, and--she counselled me to go back.|$|E
6000|$|William {{passed his}} hand across his eyes, and murmured with august satisfaction, 'Blessings on your attachment, my poor dear fellow!' Then he said aloud, 'Well, my dear Frederick, if you will only try, as <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out,</b> {{to show that you}} are alive to the occasion--that you think about it--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} allow our kind letter-writing friend," [...] Lord Kew continued, [...] "to fancy we are hurt. <b>We</b> must <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> this afternoon, {{and we must}} appear very good friends." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{wife and}} one little boy," [...] Burton continued. [...] "We were living at Garden Green {{in a small}} {{plastered}} edifice called Clematis Villa. My wife is a vigorous woman, part of whose life has been spent in domestic service, and part in a suburban dressmaker's establishment. She keeps the house very clean, pins up the oleographs presented to us at Christmas time by the grocer and the oil-man, and thinks I look genteel in a silk hat when <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> to hear the band in the public gardens on Thursday evenings." ...|$|R
60|$|Something in {{his voice}} made me {{suddenly}} sad. I was comforted when I felt the Story Girl slip her hand into mine. So <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> of the woods into the autumn dusk.|$|E
60|$|On the morrow as <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> together, {{my father}} and I, making our way as though by common consent up towards the bare brown hills, I remembered {{that there were many}} things which I wished to say to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} sure a long time. But when <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> on that Sunday I {{was such an}} idiot that I {{did not know how}} to tell him. Oh, Lady Albury, I was such a fool! What should I have done if he hadn't come back?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Supposing <b>we</b> take a <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> {{together}} this evening?" [...] Wakefield Smith suggested. [...] "No doubt {{you would like}} to see the sights." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Think!" [...] {{he begged}} her. [...] "It {{would be so}} easy. <b>We</b> could <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> of this place together, and in an hour's time you would have some one else to take your little {{troubles}} on their shoulders. Don't you think that mine are broad enough, little girt?" ...|$|R
40|$|Technology {{is growing}} rapidly and {{gone are the}} days when we had to wake up in the middle of the night to adjust our fan speed or times when we had to turn on the light each time <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> into a room and turn them off {{whenever}} <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out.</b> These works are no longer done by humans instead performed by machines through automation, which is one of the popular trends in the world of technology. Automation used for home appliances is referred as HOME AUTOMATION. This paper describes a system for efficient home automation without programming by using a 555 timer. It turns on electrical lights and fan whenever a person enters a room using PIR sensor and adjusts the speed of the fan according to room temperature...|$|R
6000|$|After {{wandering}} through the inside <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> into the old graveyard, {{to look at the}} outside. The yard is full of old, curious, mouldering gravestones; and on one of them there is an inscription sad and peculiar enough to have come from the heart of the architect who planned the abbey; it runs as follows:-- ...|$|E
60|$|So <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> {{upon the}} mud, which was mostly hard enough, past shallow pools of {{brackish}} water, smelling of asphalt, toward {{a group of}} little mud-volcanoes on the farther side. These curious openings into the nether-world are not permanent. They choke up after a while, and fresh ones appear {{in another part of}} the area, thus keeping the whole clear of plants.|$|E
60|$|Along by {{the frozen}} lake {{there is a}} kind of {{causeway}} path made for a promenade, where one might walk to observe the beauties of the season, and our cheery entertainer offered to show it to us; so <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> with him. Under the rocks in one place he showed us a little plat, about as large as a closet door, which, he said, laughing, was their garden.|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{not quite}} so common, is it? Ah, me! it's a wicked world, and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I think that I have seen enough now, Miss Stoner, and with your {{permission}} <b>we</b> shall <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> upon the lawn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am of {{the mind}} {{that it was the}} best stroke of work I have ever yet done, for not only is the skiff nearby where <b>we</b> can <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> at our leisure and step on board her; but that red-faced, beef-eating Britisher stands ready to help us put our prisoners over the rail." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well,--and if so! Had I {{a mother}} living would not Frank Tregear {{have come to}} visit her, and in visiting her, would he not have seen me,--and should <b>we</b> not have <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> together?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> {{the other}} evening, with M. Fazy, to a {{beautiful}} place, where Servetus was burned. Soft, new-mown meadow grass carpets it, and a solemn amphitheatre of mountains, glowing in the evening sky, looked down--Mont Blanc, the blue-black Mole, the Saleve! Never was deed done in a more august presence chamber! Ere this these two may have conferred together of the tragedy, with far other thoughts than then.|$|E
60|$|While {{this was}} doing, William and I {{consulted}} {{what to do}} with ourselves and what we had; and first, we resolved we would never talk seriously of our measures but in the open fields, where we were sure nobody could hear; so every evening, when the sun began to decline and the air to be moderate <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out,</b> sometimes this way, sometimes that, to consult of our affairs.|$|E
60|$|<b>We</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> {{into the}} grass-grown, fragment-strewn court beyond the Parthenon. It startled us, {{every now and}} then, to see a stony white face stare {{suddenly}} up at {{us out of the}} grass with its dead eyes. The place seemed alive with ghosts. I half expected to see the Athenian heroes of twenty centuries ago glide out of the shadows and steal into the old temple they knew so well and regarded with such boundless pride.|$|E
60|$|We {{left the}} trolley-car and tramped {{through the mud}} a hundred yards or so to the school, talking about the time <b>we</b> and Warner <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> there years ago, and the {{pleasant}} time we had.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{can go back}} an' tell him," [...] Jacob replied, promptly. [...] "I reckon <b>we</b> might <b>walk</b> {{straight}} <b>out</b> {{toward the}} fort, an' never a man here would give heed to us." ...|$|R
5000|$|Some critics {{conceded that}} Wolfe was right {{that many people}} did not {{appreciate}} the buildings. Blake Morrison, writing in the Times Literary Supplement observed that perhaps some people felt such hostility to architecture because it is [...] "a gallery <b>we</b> can't <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> of, a book we can't close, and art we can't even turn our backs on because it is there facing us {{on the other side}} of the street".|$|R
60|$|When <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> on {{the terrace}} of our hotel at Algeciras after breakfast, the first morning, we were greeted by the {{familiar}} form of the Rock of Gibraltar still advertising, as we had seen it three years before, a well-known American insurance company. It rose beyond five miles of land-locked water, which we were to cross every other day for three weeks on many idle and anxious errands, until we sailed from it at last for New York.|$|E
6000|$|When we had {{finished}} eating, that is soon, for neither of our appetites was good that morning, <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> {{of the house}} into the surrounding compound and visited the camelmen in their hut. Here we found them squatted on the ground looking very depressed indeed. When I asked them {{what was the matter}} they replied, [...] "Nothing," [...] except that they were men about to die and life was pleasant. Also they had wives and children whom they would never see again.|$|E
60|$|At this, <b>we</b> <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> {{into the}} square, and {{were about to}} ascend the {{inclined}} plane when the sentinel came up and stopped us. Thereupon a low conversation ensued between him and Maiden's Heart, {{at the end of}} which the sentry put his hand into his pocket and pulled out three beans, which he held out to us. I did not hesitate, but gave him a dollar and a half for them. He took the money and let us pass on,--Maiden's Heart at my side.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Dwight, coming up, eagerly, to Caleb, [...] "you see {{the current}} carries all our vessels down the stream, you know, Caleb, {{and we are}} going to build out a long mole, out into the middle of the brook, and that will stop our vessels; and then we are going to make it pretty wide, so that <b>we</b> can <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> upon it, and the end of it will do for a wharf." ...|$|R
60|$|Amidst a {{wondering}} silence, <b>we</b> three <b>walked</b> <b>out</b> of the Jolly Bargemen, {{and in a}} wondering silence walked home. While going along, {{the strange}} gentleman occasionally looked at me, and occasionally bit {{the side of his}} finger. As we neared home, Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion as an impressive and ceremonious one, went on ahead to open the front door. Our conference was held in the state parlor, which was feebly lighted by one candle.|$|R
2500|$|Many Democrats wanted Lieberman to be {{stripped}} of his chairmanship of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs due to his support for John McCain. Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell reached out to Lieberman, asking him to caucus with the Republicans. Ultimately, the Senate Democratic Caucus voted 42 to 13 to allow Lieberman to keep chairmanship (although he did lose his membership for the Environment and Public Works Committee). Subsequently, Lieberman announced that {{he will continue to}} caucus with the Democrats. Lieberman credited President-elect Barack Obama for helping him keep his chairmanship. Obama had privately urged Democratic Senate majority Leader Harry Reid not to remove Lieberman from his position. Reid stated that Lieberman's criticism of Obama during the election angered him, but that [...] "if you look at the problems we face as a nation, is this a time <b>we</b> <b>walk</b> <b>out</b> of here saying, 'Boy did we get even'?" [...] Senator Tom Carper of Delaware also credited the Democrats' decision on Lieberman to Obama's support, stating that [...] "If Barack can move on, so can we." ...|$|R
