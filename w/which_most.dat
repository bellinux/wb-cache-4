5|$|Sinoceratops was {{discovered}} in the Xingezhuang Formation, which was deposited during the late Cretaceous. It lived alongside leptoceratopsids, saurolophines, and tyrannosaurines.

The animals living alongside Sinoceratops and Shantungosaurus were Zhuchengceratops, Huaxiaosaurus, and Zhuchengtyrannus.|$|E
5|$|A UNPA {{could be}} created through a {{stand-alone}} treaty.

Strauss notes {{that this is the}} method by <b>which</b> <b>most</b> international bodies, such the World Health Organization, International Labour Organization, and International Criminal Court, were founded. The way to get started presumably would be to hold a conference of plenipotentiaries to draft the treaty; then the ratification process would begin.|$|E

5|$|According to Pfälzner, a final burial stage can be noticed, {{which he}} calls the {{quaternary}} burial. Tomb VII, <b>which</b> <b>most</b> probably contained remains {{taken out of the}} royal hypogeum, seems to have worked as a storage for the remains of individuals whose Kispu cycle came to an end; very few bowls were found in that tomb. The Kispu was important for demonstrating the legitimacy of the king, thus it needed to be public and visible to a large crowd; Pfälzner suggests that hall A in the royal palace was the place for the public Kispu and that the antechamber of the royal hypogeum was dedicated for private Kispu that included only the king and the spirits of his ancestors.|$|E
5|$|All {{described}} {{specimens of}} Sinosauropteryx preserve integumentary structures (filaments {{arising from the}} skin) <b>which</b> <b>most</b> palaeontologists interpret as very primitive type of feathers. These short, down-like filaments are preserved along the back half of the skull, the arms, neck, back, and {{top and bottom of}} the tail. Additional patches of feathers have been identified {{on the sides of the}} body, and palaeontologists Chen, Dong and Zheng proposed that the density of the feathers on the back and the randomness of the patches elsewhere on the body indicated the animals would have been fully feathered in life, with the ventral feathers having been removed by decomposition.|$|E
5|$|Alzheimer's {{disease is}} an incurable {{neurodegenerative}} disease <b>which</b> <b>most</b> often affects {{the elderly and}} {{accounts for more than}} half of all cases of dementia. Its exact cause remains unknown, but the disease is identified as a protein misfolding disease. Alzheimer's is associated with toxic aggregations of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide, caused by Aβ misfolding and clumping together with other Aβ peptides. These Aβ aggregates then grow into significantly larger senile plaques, a pathological marker of Alzheimer's disease. Due to the heterogeneous nature of these aggregates, experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have had difficulty characterizing their structures. Moreover, atomic simulations of Aβ aggregation are highly demanding computationally due to their size and complexity.|$|E

However, as noted by Jansson (1987), the fact {{that most of}} these runestones were raised in Uppland and Södermanland does not {{necessarily}} mean that their number reflects the composition of the Scandinavians in the Varangian Guard.

5|$|During World War II The German Navy {{deployed}} weather buoys (Wetterfunkgerät See — WFS) {{at fifteen}} fixed {{positions in the}} North Atlantic and Barents Sea. They were launched from U-boats into a maximum depth of ocean of 1000 fathoms (1,800 metres), limited by {{the length of the}} anchor cable. Overall height of the body was 10.5 metres (of <b>which</b> <b>most</b> was submerged), surmounted by a mast and extendible aerial of 9 metres. Data (air and water temperature, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity) were encoded and transmitted four times a day. When the batteries (high voltage dry-cells for the valves, and nickel-iron for other power and to raise and lower the aerial mast) were exhausted, after about eight to ten weeks, the unit self-destructed.|$|E

5|$|Hale–Bopp's orbital {{position}} was calculated as 7.2astronomical units (AU) from the Sun, placing it between Jupiter and Saturn and {{by far the}} greatest distance from Earth at which a comet had been discovered by amateurs. Most comets at this distance are extremely faint, and show no discernible activity, but Hale–Bopp already had an observable coma. An image taken at the Anglo-Australian Telescope in 1993 was found to show the then-unnoticed comet some 13AU from the Sun, a distance at <b>which</b> <b>most</b> comets are essentially unobservable. (Halley's Comet was more than 100 times fainter at the same distance from the Sun.) Analysis indicated later that its comet nucleus was 60±20kilometres in diameter, approximately six {{times the size of}} Halley.|$|E
5|$|Humans regard certain insects as pests, {{and attempt}} to control them using {{insecticides}} {{and a host of}} other techniques. Some insects damage crops by feeding on sap, leaves or fruits. A few parasitic species are pathogenic. Some insects perform complex ecological roles; blow-flies, for example, help consume carrion but also spread diseases. Insect pollinators are essential to the life cycle of many flowering plant species on <b>which</b> <b>most</b> organisms, including humans, are at least partly dependent; without them, the terrestrial portion of the biosphere (including humans) would be devastated. Many other insects are considered ecologically beneficial as predators and a few provide direct economic benefit. Silkworms and bees have been used extensively by humans for the production of silk and honey, respectively. In some cultures, people eat the larvae or adults of certain insects.|$|E
