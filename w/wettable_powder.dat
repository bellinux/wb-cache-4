50|$|Of contact {{pesticides}}, {{dust and}} <b>wettable</b> <b>powder</b> pesticides {{tend to be}} more hazardous to bees than solutions or emulsifiable concentrates. When a bee comes in contact with pesticides while foraging, the bee may die immediately without returning to the hive. In this case, the queen bee, brood, and nurse bees are not contaminated and the colony survives. Alternatively, the bee may come into contact with an insecticide and transport it back to the colony in contaminated pollen or nectar or on its body, potentially causing widespread colony death.|$|E
5000|$|Chemical {{control of}} Ditylenchus {{destructor}} {{can be achieved}} with soil-applied nematicides such as carbofuran, ethylene dibromide, VAPAM HL, and TELONE. [...] Fumigation with these nematicides is often paired with mechanical measures to attain optimal control. For example, Wisconsin has eradicated these nematodes from potatoes by repeated use of ethylene dibromide and restricting the movement of infected tubers. [...] Another management method was demonstrated by the control of potato rot nematodes in garlic. The seeds were coated with thiram or benomyl <b>wettable</b> <b>powder</b> before being planted, resulting in very good control of the disease.|$|E
50|$|A <b>wettable</b> <b>powder</b> is an {{insecticide}} {{or other}} pesticide formulation {{consisting of the}} active ingredient in a finely ground state combined with wetting agents and sometimes bulking agents. Wettable powders {{are designed to be}} applied as a dilute suspension through liquid spraying equipment. As wettable powders are not mixed with water until immediately before use, storing and transporting the products may be simplified as the weight and volume of the water is avoided. Wettable powders may be supplied in bulk or in measured sachets made from water-soluble film to simplify premixing and reduce operator exposure to the product.|$|E

It is found in some emulsifiable concentrates, ULV, <b>wettable</b> <b>powders,</b> slow release formulations, insecticidal fogs, and granules.

50|$|Bromacil (40%) is {{combined}} with the active ingredient diuron in the herbicide Krovar, which is used by companies such as the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT).

The half-life of bromacil in soils is about 60 days, but as long as 8 months in some conditions. Bromacil is available in granular, liquid, water-soluble liquid, and <b>wettable</b> <b>powder</b> formulations. Because bromacil is a possible human carcinogen and systemic toxicity may result from intermediate exposure (one week to several months), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) assessed risk to workers using several major exposure scenarios. Bromacil is stable to hydrolysis under normal environmental conditions.|$|E

40|$|The authors first {{review the}} doses and cycles of {{application}} normally recommended {{in different parts}} of the world for DDT, BHC, and dieldrin in controlling malaria, and then discuss the experimental evidence concerning their actual efficacy in the field. The irritant effect of the various insecticides is compared, DDT being found the most irritant and dieldrin the least. BHC appears to be highly irritant when solid, but not when vaporized. The problem of the application of residual insecticides to absorbent surfaces, such as mud, is considered; the <b>wettable</b> <b>powders</b> are generally accepted as the most efficient formulation for such surfaces, but even with these a marked loss in toxicity may occur, requiring higher initial doses and more frequent application than on non-absorbent surfaces. With volatile insecticides, such as BHC, some degree of absorption slows down the loss by volatilization, but at the usual field dosages of 0. 1 g and 0. 2 g of gamma-BHC per m 2 the decline in toxicity is still rapid. Experiments have also shown that mixtures of DDT and BHC may, in some circumstances, combine the initial high kill of the latter with the persistent moderate kill of the former...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of field trials under close {{supervision}} was conducted in the blowfly areas of the Karoo to investigate certain biological aspects of blowfly strike {{as well as the}} protection afforded to sheep by the insecticides Diazinon, Dieldrin, Aldrin and B. H. C. under natural conditions. (1) The biological factors rendering sheep susceptible to blowfly strike are reviewed. (2) Observations on the development of strikes in sheep treated with an insecticide as compared with unprotected animals are reported. (3) The larvicidal value of the compounds tested are discussed, as well as the factors influencing the duration of protection afforded by them. (4) Dusts and <b>wettable</b> <b>powders</b> gave longer protection than emulsions in sheep with clean and dry crutches, whereas emulsions and <b>wettable</b> <b>powders</b> gave better results in soiled sheep. (5) The protecting agent must be evenly distributed throughout the vulnerable areas of the fleece right down to skin level to ensure the maximum degree of protection. (6) No significant difference in duration and degree of protection was observed with quantities of between 0 • 45 and 2 • 85 gm. of the active ingredient per crutch region. This is probably due to this factor being overshadowed by others. (7) Insecticides gave better protection when applied to long wool than to short wool. The crutching of soiled breeches is discouraged, therefore. (8) Soiled crutches exercise an influence upon the uniformity of the application and, consequently, upon the duration and the degree of protection. This is particularly evident in the case of B. H. C. No significant differences could be detected between Diazinon, Dieldrin and Aldrin. (9) All insecticidal compounds afford a considerably shorter period of protection on young lambs than on adult sheep with an equal or even shorter length of wool. (10) The incidence of blowflies (fly population pressure) exercises the most significant influence upon duration of protection afforded by any of the insecticides. The relationship between fly population pressure and duration or protection follows the equation of a hyperbola. (11) The duration of protection afforded by Diazinon, Dieldrin and Aldrin showed no significant differences under equal conditions, whereas B. H. C. was markedly inferior. (12) The Mule's operation affords adequate protection as long as the incidence of flies is low and the wool fairly short. With higher fly population pressures the resistance of "muled" sheep to fly strike decreases rapidly. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 300 dpi.

40|$|Various {{formulations}} of agricultural chemicals, including solutions, <b>wettable</b> <b>powders,</b> and emulsifiable concentrates, contain adjuvants of solvents and surfactants {{in addition to}} active ingredients. Among these formulations, herbicides {{are among the most}} commonly used pesticides globally. Some pesticides have been demonstrated to cause severe circulatory failure in poisoned humans. To clarify the potential risk of herbicides and their adjuvants influence on the cardiovascular system, four technical grade (TG) herbicides and their end products (EP), including paraquat, glyphosate, glufosinate, and atrazine, as well as their formulated adjuvants isopropylamine (IPA), polyoxyethylene alkylether sulfate (AES), ethyl acetate (EA), xylene, petrolium- 170 (P- 170), and solvesso- 100 (S- 100), were assessed to determine their effects on isolated rat aorta and heart. The results revealed that the vasorelaxation effects of the herbicide EPs exceeded those of TGs, and atrazine produced more significant vasorelaxation in rat aortas than the other herbicides tested. The formulated adjuvants of IPA did not affect the aorta; however, AES, EA, xylene, P- 170 and S- 100 caused significant vasorelaxation. Herbicide EPs-induced vasorelaxation was generally endothelium-dependent. Furthermore, the TG and EP of paraquat, and the TG of glufosinate and glyphosate were found to have no effect on the isolated heart. However, the normal twitch tensions of the isolated heart were significantly inhibited by EPs of glyphosate and glufosinate, and by TG and EP of atrazine. Although, the adjuvants of IPA appeared unaffected, however, AES, EA, xylene, P- 170 and S- 100 caused complete inhibition and contraction on the isolated hearts. These results indicated that the adjuvants of herbicides might enhance hypotension and contributed to cardiovascular disorders during intoxication. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
