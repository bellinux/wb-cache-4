A large memorial stone, still standing, was raised outside the churchyard in memory of Augvald.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other insects, P.exclamans use sexual pheromones to attract members of the {{opposite}} sex. Researchers have attempted to determine the exact role that sexual pheromones play in sexual attraction in paper wasps. They set up a wind tunnel where males and females were exposed to a sexual pheromone wick that was isolated from males and females. These pheromones were taken by hexane extracts from wholes bodies and thoraces of unmated females. The male extracts <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ectal mandibular and seventh sternal glands. It {{was found that the}} opposite sex was attracted upwind of the scent and the results were intensified when a fan was turned on. The range of the scent was found to be around 2 metres.|$|E

5|$|During 1957, hurricanes {{that formed}} east of 140°W {{were not given}} names by the local warning center. Those that either crossed or formed west of that point were named by the National Weather Bureau in Honolulu, Hawaii. These names <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> names used for Pacific typhoons. Three names were used in 1957, they were Kanoa, Della and Nina. Due {{to the lack of}} major damage from these storms, their names were not retired. However, once the Central Pacific adopted its own naming scheme, these names were no longer used.|$|E
5|$|Josceline Percy, {{the last}} Percy earl, died in 1670. Two years later his widow allowed the keep's {{materials}} {{to be reused}} to build Chirton Hall. A total of 272cart-loads <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> keep. Josceline Percy's property passed to the Duke of Somerset through marriage. In 1698, the owners decided not to renovate Warkworth Castle after the estimate to add battlements, floors and new windows came in at £1,600. Elizabeth Seymour inherited the property from her father in 1750. Her husband, Hugh Smithson, {{changed his name to}} Hugh Percy, and the castle then descended through the Dukes of Northumberland, a dynasty he founded.|$|E

The three rings were originally set with gems, which might have been natural gemstones, or pieces of coloured glass; however, these <b>were</b> <b>taken</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rings before they were buried, perhaps for reuse. The rings are of similar design, one with an oval bezel, one with a circular bezel, and one with a large oblong bezel.|$|E
