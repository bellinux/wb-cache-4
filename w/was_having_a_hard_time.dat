In November 1916, Germany had inquired to find out if Austria-Hungary were interested in purchasing existing German submarines because Germany <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> finding trained submarine crews. After protracted negotiations, which had stalled over the outflow of Austro-Hungarian gold reserves to Germany, an agreement to purchase two submarines—UB-43 and UB-47—was reached in June 1917.|$|E

25|$|Considerable {{changes in}} the balance of power now {{undermined}} Paget's local supremacy. Mackworth had spent much of 1654 in London {{as a member of the}} Protector's Council but died near the end of the year. The new governor, the younger Humphrey Mackworth, did not wield the same monopoly of power as his father. Under the Rule of the Major-Generals, Shropshire fell into the area governed by the Independent James Berry and he brought to the fore Thomas Hunt, a leading local Presbyterian. Hunt was on good terms with Richard Baxter and they explored ways of opening up the pulpits to fresh preachers. Baxter visited and encouraged John Bryan, who <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> with a conservative congregation at Holy Cross, the former Shrewsbury Abbey, just to the east of the town. Hunt and Baxter also planned to bring Henry Newcome to Shrewsbury. The congregation of Julian's wanted to secure one of these fresh voices and began to spend considerable sums on improvements to the church, as well as making a direct approach to Newcome. Baxter wrote to Newcome, making clear that Paget's parish was the ultimate target.|$|E

50|$|Grace and Cohen (2005, 200) {{describe}} cultural relativism as {{the extent}} to which different societies and cultures have different values and ethical standards in the fields of business and organisational life. Those who embrace cultural relativism believe that all beliefs (religious, ethical, aesthetic, and political) are relative to the individual within a culture. Types of relativism include moral (where ethics depend on the social assembly), situational (where right or wrong is dependent on the situation), and cognitive (where truth itself has no objective standard). The legislative system <b>is</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> time defining laws with the diminishing set of standards, and our court system <b>is</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>harder</b> time interpreting them (Cultural Relativism - Illogical Standard 2006).|$|R

500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} {{accepting}} of the character. Noel Murray from The A.V. Club was slightly more positive towards the concept of Adam. He wrote that he [...] "love the idea of Adam" [...] but <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> understanding the coherence of his application to the main plot. He cited inconsistencies in Adam's existence, noting, [...] "Adam killed Professor Walsh weeks ago, and yet The Initiative is still fully operational, and no one seems overly bothered {{by the fact that}} one of their leaders was building a monster." [...] Murray, however, did conclude that the show's writers and producers [...] "did a decent job of bringing [...] to a conclusion". Despite critiquing the larger plot, Murray was [...] "always impressed with [...] costume/make-up". Furthermore, he was positively surprised that it [...] "took [...] a minute to recognize" [...] Adam's appearance in [...] "Restless" [...] sans makeup.|$|E

[...] Eventually the band was able to get [...] "back on track" [...] according to Ament as Vedder was allowed [...] "to get in the space of his songs." [...] The album was finished in May 1993. Vedder later said, [...] "The second record, that was the one I enjoyed making the least... I just didn't feel comfortable in the place we were at because it was very comfortable. I didn't like that at all." ...|$|E

2500|$|Retired from {{service in}} 1951, 1225 {{was sent to}} scrap, in New Buffalo, Michigan. In 1955, Michigan State University Trustee, Forest Akers was asked by C Chairman Cyrus Eaton if the University would be {{interested}} in having a steam locomotive (Eaton did not want to scrap the engines but <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> finding places that would accept them) so that engineering students would have a piece of real equipment to study. Forest Akers {{thought it was a good}} idea and proposed the idea to University President John Hannah. John Hannah accepted the gift of the locomotive. When he told the Dean of the College of Engineering about the gift, the Dean said that Engineering was not interested in an obsolete locomotive. John Hannah then called up Dr. Rollin Baker, director of the MSU Museum and told him that he was getting a locomotive. [...] The C then instructed the yardmaster at New Buffalo to send an engine to the Wyoming Shops for a cosmetic restoration and repainting with the name Chesapeake and Ohio on the side. [...] No. 1225 was the last engine in the line, i.e. easiest to get out. It had nothing to do with the number representing Christmas Day.

60|$|In the {{meantime}} the 42d <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time</b> of it.

Here Rait's gun, for he was only able from the narrowness of the path to bring one into position, did splendid service. Advancing boldly in front of the line of the 42d, ably assisted by Lieutenant Saunders, he poured round after round of grape into the enemy until their fire slackened a little, and the 42d, leaping to their feet, struggled across the swamp, which was over knee deep. Step by step they won their way through the camp and up the hill. Everywhere the dead Ashantis lay in heaps, attesting the terrible effect of the Snider fire and the determination with which they had fought.|$|E
60|$|He {{could not}} conceal it from himself--Elizabeth appealed to him. Being {{built on a}} large scale himself, he had always been {{attracted}} by small women. There was a smallness, a daintiness, a liveliness about Elizabeth that was almost irresistible. She was so capable, so cheerful {{in spite of the fact}} that she <b>was</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> <b>time.</b> And then their minds seemed to blend so remarkably. There were no odd corners to be smoothed away. Never in his life had he felt so supremely at his ease with one of the opposite sex. He loved Claire--he drove that fact home almost angrily to himself--but he was forced to admit that he had always been aware of something in the nature of a barrier between them. Claire was querulous at times, and always a little too apt to take offence. He had never been able to talk to her with that easy freedom that Elizabeth invited. Talking to Elizabeth was like talking to an attractive version of oneself. It was a thing to be done with perfect confidence, without any of that apprehension which Claire inspired lest the next remark might prove the spark to cause an explosion. But Claire was the girl he loved--there must be no mistake about that.|$|E
