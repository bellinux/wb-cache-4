40|$|In {{this article}} {{presents}} the results of triennial research of the littoral zone of the Eastern Azov Sea area. The research was done by mean of plots with phytocentral community description with mapping of projective coverage. For Euphorbia peplis we considered the projective cover, the overall closeness of vegetation, the number of individuals, population density, age structure, distribution in the East Azov Sea area, and seed production. The current status of populations of Euphorbia peplis L. in eastern part of the Azov Sea coast on Chushka and Yasenki Spit <b>wewre</b> presented. In general, the population status of Euphorbia peplis in Eastern Azov area is relatively stable. Nevertheless, under the influence of anthropogenic pressure the vitality of individuals, number of seeds, the density and size of the population consequently decline...|$|E
40|$|Using {{electromyography}} (EMG) {{analysis and}} psychological rating, the usability of pen was evaluated. The experimental factors <b>wewre</b> the pen diameter (three levels: 8 mm, 11 mm, and 13. 8 mm). The length of pen tip was fixed to 14 mm. Surface EMG was recordes from extensor digitorum and flexxor digitorum superficialis. The EMG {{before and after}} a long-hour writing task was measured to evaluate the fatigue of forearm using % MVC (Mean Voluntary Contraction), mean power frequency (MPF) and psychological rating on usability. Concerning % MVC and MPF, the difference before and the experimental task {{were used for the}} evaluation. The evaluation value corresponded to subtraction of value after the experimental task from that before the experimental task. As a result of a one-way (pen diameter) ANOVA, no significant main effects of pen diameter were for both EMG evaluation measures. As for the psychological rating on usability, Kruscal-Wallis non-parametric test was carried out. The psychological rating on ease of grip revealed a significant main effect of pen diameter. A pen with a diameter of 11 mm was found to have a significant higher rating score...|$|E
40|$|Wallenberg's Syndrome {{is usually}} {{characterized}} by crossed loss {{of pain and}} temperature sense, {{but there are many}} clinical variants that indicate different extensions of the lesion. We carried out a retrospective study in 36 patients with Wallenberg's Syndrome or with Avellis's Syndrome; two patterns of sensory defect <b>wewre</b> isolated: each pattern included four groups. Only 52. 7 % of the patients showed the classic pattern of sensory defect, while 47. 2 % had variants of different importance and meaning. In most of our cases the sensory defect, involving one side of the face and the controlateral side of the body, was correlable to a lesion in the lateral medullary region. In four patients, without sensory loss in the face, a more ventral infarction appeared presumible; on the other hand a selective sensory loss in omolateral side of the face (two cases) seemed to indicate a more dorsolateral lesion. Seven patients had a sensory defect involving only the controlateral leg and trunk, probabably following a far lateral medullary lesion,. Conversely, three patients developed a sensory defect in the controlateral arm and trunk that was correlable with a lesion in the medial portion of spinithalamic tract. Four cases, with sensory impairment of the bilateral side of the face, suggested an involvement of lateral pontine region. Our data confirm that an accurate sensory examination provides subtle details for evaluation of the lesion's level and extension, which even sophisticaded diagnstic tools do not always allo...|$|E
