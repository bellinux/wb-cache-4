500|$|Some {{officers}} of the 52nd recorded their experiences in the regiment. One of the most notable was the Reverend William Leeke who, as a young ensign, carried the Regimental Colours at Waterloo. He believed that the actions taken by Sir John Colborne (Lord Seaton) and the 52nd to defeat the Imperial Guard {{at the close of}} the battle had been unjustly overlooked in official dispatches and histories, and wrote his memoirs so that [...] "the truth, with regard to what <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> 52nd had achieved at Waterloo, [...] see the light". In 1866 his two-volume work The History of Lord Seaton's Regiment, (the 52nd Light Infantry) at the Battle of Waterloo was published, and has served as a primary source for most Waterloo historians since. Also to publish memoirs, although less successfully, was Reginald Wilberforce, grandson of slavery abolitionist William Wilberforce, who wrote, in 1894, An Unrecorded Chapter of the Indian Mutiny; on publication, the book was criticised by his fellow {{officers of}} the 52nd for its inaccuracy.|$|E
500|$|... "Leonard Betts" [...] {{was written}} by Vince Gilligan, John Shiban, and Frank Spotnitz and {{directed}} by Kim Manners.

According to Spotnitz, the script for [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] was [...] "not particularly well-loved at the time". Spotnitz later noted, however, that the episode became [...] "one of [...] favorite monster shows". Originally, the episode [...] "Never Again" [...] {{was supposed to come}} before the episode.

[...] Thus, the air date of [...] "Leonard Betts" [...] was flipped with [...] "Never Again" [...] in order to ensure that the former episode, which featured the show's two stars in their traditional roles, aired after the Super Bowl.

Any sequence that you ever do, it doesn’t matter if it’s two punches or 50 punches. The same amount of danger is always there. In order to make something look organic and real, the performers and stunt performers have got to punch each other as hard as they can ... Both of us—myself and Sam—we worked with Kevin [...] on , so <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> level that the director was wanting. So we both felt every piece had to be awesome, because he’s known for putting together amazing sequences that are both unique and hard hitting." [...] Jo also noted that [...] "trying to come up with things people haven’t seen before. There have been so many action movies and so many Marvel movies, you’re constantly wanting to set the bar higher and higher. And it feels like the moves that are even possible just get narrower and narrower cause they’ve been done before." [...] Tancharoen later reflected that [...] "everyone really liked the May versus May fight", and so he and the stunt team would use it as a benchmark to overcome when designing action sequences for future episodes.|$|E
500|$|... "Something There" [...] {{was written}} by lyricist Howard Ashman and {{composer}} Alan Menken. According to Menken, [...] "Something There" [...] was written as [...] "a very quick replacement for ... 'Human Again'," [...] the latter of which was ultimately cut from Beauty and the Beast because it was considered [...] "too ambitious" [...] for the film. Eleven minutes in length, producer Don Hahn explained that the song was cut because [...] "We just couldn't {{figure out how to}} make it work and not take away from the central story of Belle." [...] Upon learning that [...] "Human Again" [...] was removed from Beauty and the Beast, Ashman and Menken were forced to return [...] "to the drawing board to write something more contained and simple," [...] the ultimate result of which was the love song [...] "Something There," [...] which has been described as [...] "shorter and more direct" [...] than [...] "Human Again". The creative team had originally believed that the Beast saving Belle from the wolves was enough to justify the dance sequence near the end of the film, though later realised they had in fact not yet earned this moment; this quiet song where Beast gives Belle his library was pitched and written by Howard Ashman and [...] "as soon as that was written, <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> movie was going to work".|$|E
500|$|The {{individual}} character arcs {{were laid out}} by the series' creative team, with Marvel's only initial guidelines being to work around Captain America: The Winter Soldier, which sees the organization S.H.I.E.L.D. destroyed. Jed Whedon said on this, [...] "if someone told you that concept, you'd {{think it was a}} great thing to have happen {{at the beginning of the}} show or the end of Season 3. To have it happen in the middle of your first season is an interesting kind of riddle". The writers worked to establish a [...] "regular day at S.H.I.E.L.D." [...] and the existing hierarchy, and then [...] "to blow that up, <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> way to best illustrate that was by putting it on a personal level with our main man Coulson". Tancharoen elaborated that [...] "We see what it actually looks like for S.H.I.E.L.D. to crumble in Captain America 2, we see the Helicarriers literally barreling through the Triskelion, we see the massive destruction throughout the city, but the benefit of our show is we get to dive into the emotional toll of that." [...] Therefore, it was decided at the beginning of the series that one of the main characters would be a traitor, with Jed Whedon saying [...] "since this is an infiltration based on betrayal on a massive scale, we wanted to have it on the small scale, and have it be a really personal dagger to the heart." ...|$|E

500|$|Nagy set the {{adaptation}} {{several years later}} than the time in which the novel is set, so [...] "the dawn of the Eisenhower administration {{and the rise of}} HUAC could be front and center". One of the challenges of adapting the novel was translating the subjective and limited third-person viewpoint whereby the narrator [...] "sits on the shoulder of Therese and makes regular advances into (and retreats from) her head" [...] and Carol is thus largely seen through Therese's fanatical prism. Nagy was initially apprehensive of the narrative structure, considering [...] "there's no character of Carol. She's a ghost appropriately, as she should be, in the novel", adding that she was [...] "overwhelmed by the task of {{trying to come up with}} the visual equivalent for it structurally." [...] Nagy decided to split the point of view and shift perspectives from Therese to Carol, as [...] "the point of view is always with the more vulnerable party". She made Therese a photographer instead of a set designer, allowing her [...] "to be seen moving from objects to people", which Nagy likened to Highsmith as Therese is a [...] "clear stand-in" [...] for the author. Nagy drew from her personal knowledge of Highsmith for Therese, describing one of Therese's lines, [...] "I started taking pictures of people because my friend says I have to be more interested in humans", as the epitome of Highsmith: [...] "that ability to step outside of life and comment on it before participating in it". For the character of Carol, Nagy took inspiration from the silhouette and underpinning of Grace Kelly's character in Rear Window (1954). Nagy had freedom in [...] "inventing a life for , for whom, basically, <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> <b>the</b> outline of what was going on." [...] Once Nagy was able to dig into and understand the inner life of Carol, her motivations given the circumstances, then the character became easy to write. Nagy aimed to [...] "focus on the nature of what it's like to fall in love from two points of view", and show the characters [...] "just behaving ... not inhabiting positions." ...|$|E
