5|$|England {{dominated}} the 2004 series and claimed the first English whitewash in the Wisden Trophy's history.

This whitewash meant that England had won seven consecutive Tests {{for the first time}} in 75 years. The series <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> a run that would see England win the Ashes the following year.|$|E

5|$|In an {{interview}} with Alma Books, Whitehead states {{that the concept of}} the book originated from an article about the naming process for new pharmaceuticals such as Prozac.

Koufax was selected as an All-Star {{for the first time}} and made two All-Star Game appearances; MLB held two All-Star games from 1959 through 1962. He faced only one batter in the 9th inning in the first game, giving up a hit to Al Kaline and he pitched two scoreless innings in the second game.|$|E

5|$|A {{network of}} roads {{developed}} in the Lowlands in this period. Drover's roads, between the Highlands and north-east England, had become established {{by the end of}} the seventeenth century and a series of military roads were built and maintained as a response to the Jacobite Risings in the eighteenth century. At the beginning of the period, most farming was based on the Lowland fermtoun or Highland baile, but a system of land ownership based on large estates emerged. This <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> a process that would create a landscape of rectangular fields and carefully located farm complexes with interconnecting roads.

5|$|After the Federal army {{rebuilt the}} City Point Railroad, Grant used mortars to attack Lee's {{overstretched}} forces. In August, Union forces captured Mobile Bay and on September 2, Sherman captured Atlanta while Confederate forces retreated. Both victories, combined with Sheridan's triumph in the Shenandoah Valley, ensured Lincoln's reelection in November. Sherman convinced Grant and Lincoln {{to send his}} army to march on Savannah and devastate the Confederate heartland. Sherman cut a 60-mile path of destruction of Southern infrastructure unopposed, reached the Atlantic Ocean, and captured Savannah on December 22. On December 16, after much prodding by Grant, the Union Army under Thomas smashed Hood's Confederate Army at Nashville. It <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> the end for the Confederacy, with Lee's forces at Petersburg being the only significant obstacle remaining.|$|E
5|$|An {{offshoot}} of the work at MIT <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> digital circuit design theory by one of Bush's graduate students, Claude Shannon. Working on the analytical engine, Shannon described the application of Boolean algebra to electronic circuits in his landmark master's thesis, A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits. In 1935, Bush was approached by OP-20-G, which was searching for an electronic device to aid in codebreaking. Bush was paid a $10,000 fee to design the Rapid Analytical Machine (RAM). The project went over budget and was not delivered until 1938, when it {{was found to be}} unreliable in service. Nonetheless, it was an important step toward creating such a device.|$|E
