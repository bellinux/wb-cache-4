5|$|In {{traditional}} tales {{the blue}} men {{have the power}} to create severe storms, but when the weather is fine they sleep or float just under the surface of the water. They swim with their torso from the waist upwards raised out of the sea, twisting and diving in a similar way to a porpoise. To amuse themselves the creatures play shinty when the skies are clear and bright at night. They are able to speak and converse with mariners and are especially vocal when soaking vessels with water spray, roaring <b>with</b> <b>laughter</b> as vessels capsize.|$|E
5|$|The large, maze-like mansion's {{walls were}} {{constructed}} with angles slightly askew, resulting in off-center perspectives and doors that {{open and close}} by themselves. The immense library contains the ramshackle spiral staircase from which the previous owner hanged herself; the vast conservatory is adorned with eerie statues. During their first night in the house, Eleanor and Theo are terrified by supernatural occurrences outside Theo's bedroom door. Deafening banging is heard against {{the door and the}} voice of a young girl is heard echoing <b>with</b> <b>laughter.</b> Despite the turbulence, Eleanor feels a tentative affinity to Hill House.|$|E
5|$|In {{her account}} of the affair, Margaret Macaulay explores 18th-century attitudes to women in general as a {{significant}} factor and notes that although numerous documents {{from the hands of}} Lord Grange's friends and supporters are still extant, not a single contemporary female view of the affair has survived, save that of Lady Grange herself. Divorces were complex and divorced mothers were rarely given custody of children. Furthermore, Lord Grange's powerful friends in both the church and the legal profession might have made this a risky endeavour. Something of James Erskine's attitude to these matters may perhaps be gleaned from the fact that for his first speech in the House of Commons he chose to oppose the repeal of various laws relating to witchcraft. Even in his day this appeared unduly conservative and his perorations were met <b>with</b> <b>laughter,</b> which effectively ended his political career before it had begun. Writing in the mid-19th century the Sobieski Stuarts told the tale {{from the perspective of the}} descendants of the Highland aristocrats who had been responsible for Chiesley's kidnap and imprisonment. They emphasise Lady Grange's personal shortcomings, although to modern sensibilities these hardly seem good reasons for a judge and Member of Parliament and his wealthy friends to organise an illegal kidnapping and life sentence.|$|E

25|$|Wilder and Brackett, {{nervous about}} a major {{screening}} in Hollywood, held a preview in Evanston, Illinois, in late 1949. The original edit {{opened with a}} scene inside a morgue, with the assembled corpses discussing how they came to be there. The story began with the corpse of Joe Gillis recounting his murder to the others. The audience reacted <b>with</b> <b>laughter</b> and seemed unsure whether to view {{the rest of the}} film as drama or comedy. After a similar reaction during its second screening in Poughkeepsie, New York, and a third in Great Neck, the morgue opening was replaced by a shorter poolside opening, using footage filmed on January 5, 1950.|$|E
25|$|Scene II: At Sir Peter's house, Lady Sneerwell, Mrs. Candour, Sir Benjamin, and Crabtree {{exchange}} confused rumours {{about the}} Teazle affair. Sir Benjamin says Sir Peter {{was wounded in}} a swordfight with Joseph Surface, while Crabtree insists it was a pistol duel with Charles. When Sir Oliver enters, they take him for a doctor and demand news of the wounded man. At that moment Sir Peter arrives to prove the report wrong, and orders the scandalmongers out of his house. Sir Oliver says he has met both of his nephews and agrees with Sir Peter's (former) estimate of Joseph's high character, but then acknowledges <b>with</b> <b>laughter</b> that he knows {{the story of what}} happened at Joseph's with the closet and screen. When he leaves, Rowley tells Sir Peter that Lady Teazle is in tears in the next room, and Sir Peter goes to reconcile with her.|$|E

500|$|In medieval France, cats {{would be}} burnt alive {{as a form}} of entertainment. According to Norman Davies, the {{assembled}} people [...] "shrieked <b>with</b> <b>laughter</b> as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally carbonized".|$|E
500|$|However, even in {{the last}} months of her life, she found ways to enjoy herself. She {{and other members of the}} {{household}} performed plays for the enjoyment of their parents and others in the spring of 1918. Anastasia's performance made everyone howl <b>with</b> <b>laughter,</b> according to her tutor Sydney Gibbes.|$|E
500|$|Alec Guinness was {{originally}} offered only four D'Ascoyne parts, recollecting [...] "I read [...] {{on a beach}} in France, collapsed <b>with</b> <b>laughter</b> on the first page, and didn't even bother to {{get to the end of}} the script. I went straight back to the hotel and sent a telegram saying, 'Why four parts? Why not eight!?'â€‰"; he eventually played nine parts.|$|E

500|$|In {{conveying}} his {{impressions of}} Falstaff, Hazlitt first emphasises the sheer physical bulk that we remember him by: [...] "We are as {{well acquainted with}} his person as his mind, and his jokes come upon us with double force and relish from the quantity of flesh through which they make their way, as he shakes his fat sides <b>with</b> <b>laughter</b> [...]|$|E
500|$|In the 1999 [...] "No Man's Land" [...] storyline, the Joker murders Commissioner Gordon's second wife, Sarah, as she shields a {{group of}} infants. He taunts Gordon, who shoots him in the kneecap. The Joker, lamenting that he may never walk again, collapses <b>with</b> <b>laughter</b> when he realizes that the {{commissioner}} has avenged Barbara's paralysis. This story also introduced the Joker's girlfriend, Harley Quinn.|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr {{later said}} that she, Voormann and Vollmer {{felt guilty about}} being German, and about Germany's recent history. Meeting the Beatles was {{something}} very special for her, although she knew that English people would think that she ate sauerkraut, and would comment on her heavy German accent, but they made jokes about it together. Lennon would make sarcastic remarks from the stage, saying [...] "You Krauts, we won the war," [...] knowing that very few Germans in the audience spoke English, but any English sailors present would roar <b>with</b> <b>laughter.</b>|$|E

500|$|Of course, I haven't any {{voice to}} speak of, but I {{have a great}} register, and Sullivan used to amuse himself by making me sing bass in one number of an opera and tenor in another. [...] In 'Ruddygore', Sir Arthur had engaged a man to play the servant, my menial, so to speak, who had an {{enormous}} bass voice, and who had {{to go down to}} the lower E flat. [...] Singularly enough, he could go down to G, and then he dropped out entirely, and I did the [...] below. [...] Generally the audience roared <b>with</b> <b>laughter,</b> and it absolutely brought down the house.|$|E
500|$|Gilbert finally {{called on}} Sullivan {{and read the}} {{libretto}} to him on 20 February 1875. [...] Sullivan was enthusiastic, later recalling, [...] " [...] read it through ...in {{the manner of a}} man considerably disappointed with what he had written. [...] As soon as he had come to the last word, he closed up the manuscript violently, apparently unconscious {{of the fact that he}} had achieved his purpose so far as I was concerned, inasmuch as I was screaming <b>with</b> <b>laughter</b> the whole time." [...] Trial by Jury, described as [...] "A Novel and Original Dramatic Cantata" [...] in the original promotional material, was composed and rehearsed in a matter of weeks.|$|E
500|$|O'Reilly {{became a}} journalist, and {{together}} with Fingleton, he often criticised Bradman. They {{were in the}} press box when Bradman was bowled for a duck in his final Test innings, when they {{were reported to have}} become hysterical <b>with</b> <b>laughter.</b> Nevertheless, O'Reilly kept most of his strongest feelings about Bradman to himself and suppressed them from his autobiography; he would say of Bradman that [...] "You don't piss on statues". Before his death, O'Reilly gave a series of interviews to the National Library of Australia, in which he accused Bradman of purging Grimmett from the team because Grimmett had joked that Bradman had ensured his own dismissal in a match against Victoria, to avoid facing the express pace of Ernie McCormick.|$|E

500|$|Terry-Thomas {{spent the}} 1954 summer season {{performing}} at the Winter Gardens Pavilion, Blackpool before starring {{in a second}} series of Top of the Town, which ran from October 1954 to February 1955. At {{the end of the}} series he appeared as Hubert Crone in the play Room for Two, which had a UK tour prior to a run at the Prince of Wales Theatre, London. The last stop on the UK tour was at the Brighton Hippodrome, where Terry-Thomas broke his arm on stage; he returned to the show five days later when the tour reached London. He later joked that [...] "the audience roared <b>with</b> <b>laughter</b> when I fell and made horrible faces, so much so that I considered breaking the other arm for an encore". The London run was not a success and the show closed after 48performances.|$|E
500|$|At {{the museum}} Pound met {{regularly}} with the curator and poet Laurence Binyon, who {{introduced him to}} the East Asian artistic and literary concepts that inspired the imagery and technique of his later poetry. The museum's visitors' books show that Pound was often found during 1912 and 1913 in the Print Room examining Japanese ukiyo-e, some inscribed with Japanese waka verse, a genre of poetry whose economy and strict conventions likely contributed to Imagist techniques of composition. He was working at the time on the poems that became Ripostes (1912), trying to move away from his earlier work; he wrote that the [...] "stilted language" [...] of Canzoni had reduced Ford Madox Ford to rolling on the floor <b>with</b> <b>laughter.</b> He realized with his translation work that the problem lay not in his knowledge of the other languages, but in his use of English: ...|$|E
500|$|Jason Elias of AllMusic {{describes}} [...] "Cry" [...] as a moody {{and reflective}} piece of material reminiscent of Jackson's Quincy Jones-produced ballads for Bad, and indicates the song's themes {{are those of}} alienation and sorrow rather than love. [...] He believes {{the strength of the}} strings, the competent backing vocals, and the keyboard figures prevent the listener from convulsing <b>with</b> <b>laughter</b> at Jackson's [...] "oh-so-pained delivery" [...] and interjections of [...] "Hold on" [...] or [...] "Oh my!" [...] Jon Pareles of the New York Times called the track the [...] "change-the-world-song" [...] and wrote that the single [...] "applies its grand buildup to one of pop's strangest utopian schemes," [...] which was asking everyone to cry at the same time, at which point Jackson may answer their prayers. [...] Catherine Halaby of Yale Daily News felt that the song is a [...] "less triumphant use of a contemporary's input" [...] on the album.|$|E
