500|$|New Zealand singer Hayley Westenra covered [...] "I'm Kissing You" [...] for her 2007 album Prayer. [...] "Kissing You" [...] {{was covered}} by Taylor Dayne, whose version appears as the eighth track on her fifth studio album, Satisfied (2008). Her {{recording}} contains slow jam drums and backing singers. Australian Idol winner Stan Walker recorded his rendition of the song as the twelfth track on his second studio album, From the Inside Out (2010). Allmusic's Jon O'Brien called it [...] "a faithful rendition". The New Zealand Heralds Kara Scott noted that his cover was [...] "a little over-wrought and soppy, [...] it shows the true range and quality of Walker's voice." [...] Cameron Adams of The Daily Telegraph noted that [...] "for those who <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> voice sing something familiar, the lush but simple cover of Des'ree's 'Kissing You' will cause jaws to drop." ...|$|E
500|$|Spector made various {{changes to}} the songs. His most {{dramatic}} embellishments occurred on 1 April 1970, the last ever Beatles recording session, when he added orchestral overdubs to [...] "The Long and Winding Road", [...] "Across the Universe" [...] and [...] "I Me Mine" [...] at Abbey Road Studios. The {{only member of the}} Beatles present was Starr, who played drums with the session musicians to create Spector's characteristic [...] "Wall of Sound". Already known for his eccentric behaviour in the studio, Spector was in a peculiar mood that day, according to balance engineer Peter Bown: [...] "He wanted tape echo on everything, he had to take a different pill every half hour and had his bodyguard with him constantly. He was on the point of throwing a wobbly, saying 'I want to hear this, I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that.</b> I must have this, I must have that.'" [...] The orchestra became so annoyed by Spector's behaviour that the musicians refused to play any further; at one point, Bown left for home, forcing Spector to telephone him and persuade him into coming back after Starr had told Spector to calm down.|$|E

[...] Feinstein, who in March 2006 had demanded the revocation of the scholarships of every Duke men's lacrosse team member, and who (against {{the findings of the}} Coleman report) continued to describe the team as [...] "out-of-control", added [...] "I don't think I've been proven wrong." ...|$|E

2500|$|Millennials Rising ascribes seven [...] "core traits" [...] to the Millennial cohort, which are: special, sheltered, confident, team-oriented, conventional, pressured, and achieving. A 2009, Chronicle of Higher Education report commented Howe and Strauss based these core traits on a [...] "hodgepodge of anecdotes, statistics, and pop-culture references" [...] and on {{surveys of}} {{approximately}} 600 high-school seniors from Fairfax County, Virginia, an affluent county with {{median household income}} approximately twice the national average. The report described Millennials Rising as a [...] "good-news revolution" [...] making [...] "sweeping predictions" [...] and as describing Millennials as [...] "rule followers who were engaged, optimistic, and downright pleasant", commenting the book gave educators and [...] "tens of millions of parents, a warm feeling.

60|$|What Mr. Wilmot {{might think}} was felt by all to affect them more nearly.

2500|$|The band's first {{performance}} in 2005 {{was at the}} Live 8 concert, Barrie, Ontario on July 2 where the song [...] "Where Are You" [...] was premiered in its final form. For this tour they were accompanied by guitarist Joel Shearer of the band Pedestrian. Leading up to the album's release, they toured several small clubs in the Los Angeles area [...] "to work the bugs out" [...] and help the band get a better feel for the songs. They then toured steadily across North America, opening two shows for The Rolling Stones, until October when a family member of a band member became ill and several shows had to be canceled. The band chose to play smaller venues on this tour rather than arenas because the sound quality was better. [...] "And for us, this new record {{is one of those}} things where there are a lot of little guitar parts happening all over the place and little textures -- and we <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> stuff." [...] A cross-Canadian tour continued through summer of 2006 with the final show being played at Rogers Centre in Toronto. The band entered a hiatus period after this while Maida worked on his solo album, The Hunter's Lullaby. They wouldn't play live again until mid-2008.|$|E
2500|$|Jackman first created {{three pieces}} of music for {{directors}} Anthony and Joe Russo: a modern Captain America theme; a six-to-seven minute suite for the Winter Soldier; and a track representing Hydra. Concerning Captain America, Jackman struggled to balance having [...] "enough theme so that you’ve got something heroic to cling onto, {{but not so much}} that it’s just becoming nostalgic and irrelevant", and stated that in the third act [...] "the more melodic, the more lyrical, the more thematic element [...] to come through". The one note Feige gave Jackman on the score was asking him to embrace [...] "those moments that are emotional or historical or nostalgic", such as when the character visits his own Smithsonian exhibit. For those, Jackman took some inspiration from the works of Aaron Copland. Jackman described the Winter Soldier as [...] "a mechanized, violent, relentless, nihilistic beast that just destroys everything in its path", so approaching the character in a Wagnerian way would be [...] "inappropriate ... instead [...] to embrace it and start exploiting all these other tricks I've learned in working in the record industry and making drum and bass records." [...] In the Winter Soldier suite, [...] "the strings only show up for the last minute. It is violent—it's got screaming and banging and it's dystopian and dysfunctional. Much closer to a modern electronic thing than anything orchestral." [...] Jackman spent ten days just processing vocal recordings to give the theme a sense of [...] "tortured, time-stretched human cries of someone who has been so processed that it's become mechanized at the same time but you can still hear the human in there". He also tried to give the piece an arc, where the human elements get more [...] "revealed {{toward the end of the}} film" [...] as Captain America and the audience come to learn who the Winter Soldier is and care about him. When Jackman played the suite for the directors, they loved the unique and non-film music sound, and asked that Jackman not sanitize or water it down for the film—Joe said, [...] "I really <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>that</b> in the movie and not just 20% of" [...] it. For Hydra, Jackman wanted to move away from the [...] "Wagnerian symphonic baddie music" [...] of the first film, and [...] "come up with a sinister tonality that didn’t feel like the muhahahaha of an arch villain, because the sinister nature of the neo-fascist within the film is modern, credible and politically contemporary." [...] Jackman also introduces a motif for the Falcon.|$|E

5000|$|The Howlin' Wolf Album, like rival bluesman Muddy Waters's album Electric Mud, was {{designed}} {{to appeal to the}} hippie audience. The album had an attention-getting cover: large black letters on a white background proclaiming [...] "This is Howlin' Wolf's new album. He doesn't like it. He didn't like his electric guitar at first either." [...] The album cover may have contributed to its poor sales. Chess co-founder Leonard Chess admitted that the cover was a bad idea, saying, [...] "I guess negativity isn't a good way to sell records.

I couldn't bear it from him. Or I thought I couldn't before--before--" [...] He stopped again, and gulped. [...] "I reckon now there ain't anything I couldn't bear." [...] March was moved by the blunt words and the mute stare forward with which they ended. [...] "Mr. Dryfoos, I didn't know that you understood Lindau's German, or I shouldn't have allowed him he wouldn't have allowed himself--to go on.
