They wanted these new characters to be scientists, who would be interested in finding the island for their own personal reasons. They decided to create a character who would be interested in lost civilizations, and named her Charlotte Staples Lewis as a reference to C. S.

5|$|In {{at least}} some species, once a {{bumblebee}} has visited a flower, it leaves a scent mark on it. This scent mark deters bumblebees from visiting that flower until the scent degrades. This scent mark is a general chemical bouquet that bumblebees leave behind in different locations (e.g. nest, neutral, and food sites), and they learn to use this bouquet to identify both rewarding and unrewarding flowers, and {{may be able to}} identify <b>who</b> <b>else</b> has visited a flower. Bumblebees rely on this chemical bouquet more when the flower has a high handling time, that is, where it takes a longer time for the bee to find the nectar once inside the flower.|$|E

5|$|Hitler {{was deeply}} {{concerned}} that Ernst Röhm, {{the chief of}} the SA, was planning a coup. Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich plotted with Göring to use the Gestapo and SS to crush the SA. Members of the SA got wind of the proposed action and thousands of them took to the streets in violent demonstrations on the night of 29 June 1934. Enraged, Hitler ordered the arrest of the SA leadership. Röhm was shot dead in his cell when he refused to commit suicide; Göring personally went over the lists of detainees—numbering in the thousands—and determined <b>who</b> <b>else</b> should be shot. At least 85 people were killed in the period of 30 June to 2 July, which is now known as the Night of the Long Knives. Hitler admitted in the Reichstag on 13 July that the killings had been entirely illegal, but claimed a plot had been under way to overthrow the Reich. A retroactive law was passed making the action legal. Any criticism was met with arrests.|$|E

25|$|Like many German {{doctors who}} had been in some way complicit with the Nazi regime's crimes against humanity, Stieve was never held accountable. After the Doctors' Trial at Nuremberg in 1946 led to {{convictions}} of 14 physicians who had conducted experiments on unwilling living subjects in concentration camps, the country's medical profession looked within itself to see <b>who</b> <b>else</b> among its members had also committed war crimes. In 1948 it was announced that only several hundred of the country's thousands of physicians had done so, a number that excluded Stieve and many of his fellow anatomists who did their work at universities rather than camps. The profession was worried about the possible loss of teaching physicians to Germany if all who had accepted bodies of the executed for research were imprisoned or otherwise disqualified from practicing or teaching.|$|E

It's wonderful to behold Pfeiffer's infatuation with the donkey-eared Bottom, who she winds in her arms as 'doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle gently twist'; her love is so real, we almost believe it.

In her memoirs, Tatiana von Metternich reported that Wittgenstein planned to kill Hitler after the ceremony at which he received his Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross in 1943.

Gordon-Cumming then withdrew while the royal party discussed what the next steps would be. He returned after half an hour to find just the two courtiers, who urged him to sign a document that they had drafted. Under pressure, and still denying the accusations, Gordon-Cumming signed the document without knowing <b>who</b> <b>else</b> would sign it afterwards.|$|E
500|$|Melvin {{defended his}} {{decision}} to hold people without access to legal advice by arguing that lawyers, unwittingly or otherwise, might pass information they had gleaned during interviews to other suspects. He said under cross-examination during the 1987 murder trial that, in his view, [...] "the integrity of some firms of solicitors left {{a lot to be}} desired"; he believed solicitors were being retained by people who had an interest in learning what other suspects had said. The Crown prosecutor, Roy Amlot QC, told the court that the police had one effective weapon, namely that suspects did not know <b>who</b> <b>else</b> had spoken to police and what they had said, and that [...] "the use of that weapon by the police was legitimate and effective." ...|$|E

[...] He also stated, [...] "Comparisons to Mariah Carey are starting to grow tiresome, but truly— <b>who</b> <b>else</b> has a range like that?" [...] Kyle Anderson of Entertainment Weekly praised the production of [...] "Baby I" [...] dubbing it as a throwback and felt that the song argued Grande as [...] "the new Mariah".

500|$|After Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason) {{landed on}} the island in season three, the {{producers}} began to plan <b>who</b> <b>else</b> {{would be on the}} boat she came from. They wanted these new characters to be interested in finding the island for their own personal reasons. The team created consisted of Frank, Daniel Faraday, Charlotte Lewis and Miles Straume, referred to as the [...] "freighter folk". Their relationship with the survivors of Flight 815 formed the crux of the fourth season. Co-executive producer/writer Edward Kitsis had been pitching the name [...] "Lapidus" [...] for years, finally naming an unseen character in the fourteenth episode of the third season Rick Lapidus. Unsatisfied, Kitsis developed the character [...] "Frank Lapidus, Helicopter Pilot". According to producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, Jeff Fahey [...] "was the first and only choice for the role". Cuse had enjoyed Fahey's roles in The Lawnmower Man and The Marshal, and he and Lindelof commended his [...] "intense eyes", stating that [...] "he has exactly the right sensibilities" [...] for the part. Fahey was offered the part without having to audition. At the time the producers began to consider him for the role, he had taken a break from acting and was living in Afghanistan, doing charity work and running an orphanage in Kabul. When Cuse contacted him about appearing in the show, Fahey was {{on the top of a}} mountain in Caracas, Venezuela during a rainstorm, having just opened an orphanage. He had never seen the series before, but the producers talked him through the first three seasons in an attempt to convince him to return to acting and accept the role. When he was cast, Fahey was unaware of whether he would be a guest star, or would develop into a regular. Focus on the character was diminished by the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike, which resulted in the fourth season being cut short. The latter half of the season did feature the character more predominately, however some stories planned for Frank and his fellow freighter folk had to be deferred to the fifth season.|$|E
