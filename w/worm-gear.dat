50|$|Unlike with {{ordinary}} gear trains, {{the direction of}} transmission (input shaft vs output shaft) is not reversible when using large reduction ratios, due to the greater friction involved between the worm and worm-wheel, when usually a single start (one spiral) worm is used.

50|$|Day-Elder Motors Corporation (1918-1937, {{also known}} as D.E.) was a {{manufacturer}} of trucks in Irvington, New Jersey. Production began in 1918. The company originated from the earlier National Motors Manufacturing Company, also of Irvington. The vehicles used proprietary engines, transmissions, and rear axles. The brand used a <b>worm-gear</b> final drive, leading to a smooth drive - this was considered enough of a selling argument that a worm gear was adopted as the brand's logo and heavily used in the brand's advertising. Day-Elder also had a steady market in fire trucks, and chassis were sold {{to be used as}} taxicabs in New York City.

Like the preceding black wax Amberols, they provide twice the playing time of 2-minute cylinders by using a finer groove with a pitch of 200 lines per inch instead of 100. They cannot be played on older machines set up to play only the earlier standard 2 minute cylinders, as both wax and celluloid Amberols require a smaller stylus tip to fit the finer groove and the <b>worm-gear</b> which moves the stylus {{over the surface of}} the cylinder must turn at a different rate. Thomas A. Edison, Inc. sold kits with gear assemblies and reproducers that could be installed by the owner of an older Edison machine so that both standard and 4-minute records could be played.

The Indian <b>worm-gear</b> roller gin, invented some time around the sixteenth century, has, according to Lakwete, remained virtually unchanged up to the present time.

Whitney's gin used a combination of a wire screen and small wire hooks to pull the cotton through, while brushes continuously removed the loose cotton lint to prevent jams. It revolutionized the cotton industry in the United States, but also led to the growth of slavery in the American South as the demand for cotton workers rapidly increased. The invention has thus been identified as an inadvertent contributing factor to the outbreak of the American Civil War. Modern automated cotton gins use multiple powered cleaning cylinders and saws, and offer far higher productivity than their hand-powered forebears.|$|E

40|$|QCD factorisation for semi-inclusive deep inelastic {{scattering}} (DIS) at low transverse {{momentum in the}} current-fragmentation region has been established recently, providing a rigorous basis to study the transverse-momentum–dependent (TMD) distribution and fragmentation functions of partons from semi-inclusive DIS data using different spin-dependent and spin-independent observables. The main focus of the experiments were the measurements of various single- and double-spin asymmetries in hadron electro-production (ep↑ → ehX) with unpolarised, longitudinally and transversely polarised targets. The joint use of a longitudinally polarised beam and longitudinally and transversely polarised targets allowed to measure double-spin asymmetries related to leading-twist distribution functions describing the transverse momentum distribution of longitudinally and transversely polarised quarks in a longitudinally and transversely polarised nucleons (helicity and <b>worm-gear</b> TMDs). The single-spin asymmetries measured with transversely polarised targets, provided access to specific leading-twist parton distribution functions: the transversity, the Sivers function and the so-called “pretzelosity” function.

40|$|Lattice QCD {{calculations}} of transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs) in nucleons are presented, {{based on the}} evaluation of nucleon matrix elements of quark bilocal operators with a staple-shaped gauge connection. Both time-reversal odd effects, namely, the generalized Sivers and Boer-Mulders transverse momentum shifts, as well as time-reversal even effects, namely, the generalized transversity {{and one of the}} generalized <b>worm-gear</b> shifts are studied. Results are obtained on two different $n_f = 2 + 1 $ flavor ensembles with approximately matching pion masses but very different discretization schemes: domain-wall fermions (DWF) with lattice spacing $a= 0. 084 $ fm and pion mass 297 MeV, and Wilson-clover fermions with $a= 0. 114 $ fm and pion mass 317 MeV. Comparison of the results on the two ensembles yields insight into the length scales at which lattice discretization errors are small, and into {{the extent to which the}} renormalization pattern obeyed by the continuum QCD TMD operator continues to apply in the lattice formulation. For the studied TMD observables, the results are found to be consistent between the two ensembles at sufficiently large separation of the quark fields within the operator, whereas deviations are observed in the local limit and in the case of a straight link gauge connection, which is relevant to the studies of parton distribution functions.

40|$|After {{fifty years}} of investigations, the nucleon {{structure}} is still far from being understood and continues to represent a unique test bench for QCD. Despite the enormous progresses achieved in five decades of deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) experiments, a number of crucial open questions {{are still on the}} carpet and subject of intense theoretical and experimental studies. In the last decade, semi-inclusive DIS (SIDIS) was established as a unique tool {{for the study of the}} non-collinear structure of nucleons, involving the parton transverse momentum p_T as an additional degree of freedom. Requiring the detection of at least one final state hadron in coincidence with the scattered lepton, it opened the way not only to the measure of the chiral-odd transversity distribution, the last missing leading-twist collinear parton distribution function, but also to a variety of new p_T- dependent PDFs, known as TMDs. Describing correlations between the quark transverse momentum and the quark or the nucleon spin (spin-orbit correlations), TMDs account for a number of intriguing effects observed in polarized and unpolarized reactions, and allow for a 3 -dimensional description of the nucleon in momentum space (nucleon tomography). Furthermore, they could provide insights into the yet unmeasured quark orbital angular momentum. At leading-twist eight TMDs enter the SIDIS cross section in conjunction with a fragmentation function. Among them, particularly interesting is the Sivers function, describing the correlation between the quark transverse momentum and the transverse nucleon polarization. At HERMES this distribution function is probed through a specific azimuthal modulations in the distribution of hadrons produced in SIDIS of unpolarized electrons and positrons off transversely polarized hydrogen. Amplitudes of these modulations for identified pions and kaons, recently extracted also in a three-dimensional kinematic space, will be reported. Other intriguing TMDs include the <b>worm-gear</b> g_ 1 T function, describing the probability to find longitudinally polarized quarks within a transversely polarized nucleon. It can be accessed in SIDIS in A_LT double-spin asymmetries, requiring the joint use of a longitudinally polarized beam and a transversely polarized target.

40|$|The figure depicts {{selected}} {{aspects of}} a six-legged robot that moves by hopping {{and that can be}} steered {{in the sense that it}} can be launched into a hop in a controllable direction. This is a prototype of hopping robots being developed for use in scientific exploration of rough terrain on remote planets that have surface gravitation less than that of Earth. Hopping robots could also be used on Earth, albeit at diminished hopping distances associated with the greater Earth gravitation. The upper end of each leg is connected through two universal joints to an upper and a lower hexagonal frame, such that the tilt of the leg depends on the relative position of the two frames. Two non-back-driveable <b>worm-gear</b> motor drives are used to control the relative position of the two frames along two axes 120 apart, thereby controlling the common tilt of all six legs and thereby, further, controlling the direction of hopping. Each leg includes an upper and a lower aluminum frame segment with a joint between them. A fiberglass spring, connected via hinges to both segments, is used to store hopping energy prior to launch into a hop and to cushion the landing at the end of the hop. A cable for loading the spring is run into each leg through the center of the universal joints and then down along the center lines of the segments to the lower end of the leg. A central spool actuated by a motor with a harmonic drive and an electromagnetic clutch winds in all six cables to compress all six springs (thereby also flexing all six legs) simultaneously. To ensure that all the legs push off and land in the same direction, timing- belt pulley drives are attached to the leg segments, restricting the flexing and extension of all six legs to a common linear motion. In preparation for a hop, the spool can be driven to load the spring legs by an amount corresponding to a desired hop distance within range. The amount of compression can be computed from the reading of a shaft-angle encoder that indicates the amount by which the spool has been turned. When the robot is ready to hop, the electromagnetic clutch disengages the motor from the spool, thus releasing the cable restraints on the springs and allowing the springs to extend all six legs simultaneously...|$|E
40|$|The nucleon spin {{structure}} on quark level {{can be described}} at leading twist by three quark distribution functions, when {{the contribution of the}} transverse momentum of the quarks is ignored. The unpolarized distributon function f (x) describes the probability of finding a quark with a momentum fraction x of the nucleon momentum. The helicity distributon function g (x) gives the difference in probability of finding quarks with momentum fraction x with spins parallel and antiparallel to the nucleon spin inside a longitudinally polarized nucleon. The last one, the so-called transversity distributon function h (x), describes the difference in probability of finding quarks with momentum fraction x with spins parallel and antiparallel to the nucleon spin inside a transversely polarized nucleon. The distribution functions f (x) and g (x) have been investigated for almost four decades, while h (x) is still mostly unknown. Due to its chiral-odd nature, it cannot be accessed in inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS), but it can be measured in semi inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS) of leptons off a transversely polarized nucleon target, where it leads in combination with the so-called Collins fragmentation function H ? 1 to an azimuthal asymmetry in the distribution of the hadrons produced. If additionally the transverse momentum of the quarks is taken into account, eight distribution functions are needed at leading order to describe the structure of the nucleon. For a transversely polarized nucleon target the Sivers effect is of special interest, as it describes the fragmentation of an unpolarized quark inside a transversely polarized target nucleon, which can be measured as an asymmetry in the azimuthal distribution of the hadrons produced. Parameterizing the SIDIS cross section up to twist-three leads to 18 structure functions of which eight depend on a transversely polarized target. Four of the eight are connected to leading order distribution functions, the aforementioned transversity and Sivers functions, the <b>worm-gear</b> 2 function and the pretzelosity function. The other four are of subleading order. The investigation {{of the structure of the}} nucleon spin is one of the main goals of the COMPASS experiment at CERN. For the measurement of transverse spin effects a 160 GeV =c polarized + beam is scattered off a polarized nucleon target. In the years 2002 – 2004 a deuterium (6 LiD) target was used, while in 2007 and 2010 the measurement was done on a proton (NH 3) target. In this thesis the methods of analysis and the results for the eight transverse spin dependend distribution functions from the 2010 data-taking period will be shown for unidentified hadrons as well as for identified pions and kaons. Furthermore the Collins and Sivers asymmetries for the production of K 0 are presented. The work is concluded by a comparison of the measured asymmetries with the results of the HERMES experiment at DESY and existing model predictions.
