5|$|There are two {{distinct}} wine-producing regions in Croatia. The continental {{region in the}} northeast of the country, especially Slavonia, is capable of producing premium wines, particularly whites. Along the north coast, Istrian and Krk <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> similar to those produced in neighbouring Italy, while further south in Dalmatia, Mediterranean-style red <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> the norm. Annual production of wine exceeds 140million litres. Croatia was almost exclusively a wine-consuming country up until the late 18th century when a more massive production and consumption of beer started; the annual consumption of beer in 2008 was 83.3litres per capita which placed Croatia in 15th place among the world's countries.|$|E
5|$|Chardonnay {{is a major}} white grape, used in the Vin de Pays d'Oc and the {{sparkling}} Crémant de Limoux. Others include Chenin blanc and Mauzac, {{which is also the}} principal grape in {{the sparkling}} Blanquette de Limoux. The sweet fortified wines of the Muscat de Frontignan and Muscat de St-Jean Minervois regions are made with the Muscat Blanc à Petits Grains grapes. In the Muscat de Rivesaltes AOC, fortified <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> made from Muscat of Alexandria grapes.|$|E
5|$|The five {{best known}} appellations in the Languedoc include Languedoc AOC (formerly {{known as the}} Coteaux du Languedoc), Corbières AOC, Faugères, Minervois AOC, and Saint-Chinian AOCs. The vast {{majority}} of Languedoc <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> produced by wine cooperatives which number more than 500. However, the appellation system {{in the region is}} undergoing considerable changes with both new appellations being created and existing ones changing. One recent change is that the Coteaux du Languedoc has changed name to Languedoc and been extended to include also the Roussillon.|$|E
50|$|Maran Winery, {{opened in}} 1992 in Yerevan. A variety of <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> {{produced}} under the brands St. Anna, Zarm, Noravank, Bagratuni, and Arpa. Areni <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> produced under the brands Areni Maran, Areni Malishka and Areni Yeghegnadzor, while Pinot <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> produced as Avagini Rouge and Avagini Blanc. Pomegranate <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> produced as M. Parajanov, while apricot <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> branded as Maran Apricot. The winery also produces {{a variety of}} fruit vodka labeled as Bark. The company's Bagratuni red dry wine received a bronze medal in the 2014 Decanter World Wine Awards.|$|R
50|$|Fortified <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> <b>wine,</b> such as port or sherry, {{to which}} a {{distilled}} beverage (usually brandy) has <b>been</b> added. Fortified <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> distinguished from spirits made from wine in that spirits are produced by means of distillation, while fortified <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> simply <b>wine</b> that has had a spirit added to it. Many different styles of fortified <b>wine</b> have <b>been</b> developed, including port, sherry, madeira, marsala, commandaria, and the aromatized wine vermouth.|$|R
25|$|As {{in much of}} {{the ancient}} world, sweet white <b>wine</b> <b>was</b> the most highly {{regarded}} style. <b>Wines</b> <b>were</b> often very alcoholic, with Pliny noting that a cup of Falernian would catch fire from a candle flame drawn too close. <b>Wine</b> <b>was</b> often diluted with warm water, occasionally seawater.|$|R
5|$|The vast {{majority}} of Israelis drink wine in moderation, and almost always at meals or social occasions. Israelis drink about 6.5 liters of wine per person per year, which is low compared to other wine-drinking Mediterranean countries, but the per capita amount has been increasing since the 1980s as Israeli production of high-quality wine grows to meet demand, especially of semi-dry and dry wines. In addition to Israeli wines, {{an increasing number of}} <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> imported from France, Italy, Australia, the United States, Chile and Argentina.|$|E
5|$|This Croatian {{vineyard}} contained {{just nine}} Crljenak Kaštelanski vines mixed {{with thousands of}} other vines. In 2002, additional vines known locally as Pribidrag {{were found in the}} Dalmatian coastal town of Omiš. Both clones are being propagated in California under the aegis of Ridge Vineyards, although virus infections have delayed their release. The first Croatian ZPC wine was made by Edi Maletić in 2005. Meanwhile, plantings of Primitivo have increased in California, where it seems to grow somewhat less vigorously than its sibling. Its <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> reputed to have more blackberry and spice flavors.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other wines}} {{produced}} in the United States, Oregon <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> marketed as varietals. Oregon law requires that wines {{produced in the}} state must be identified by the grape variety from which it was made, and for most varietals it must contain at least 90% of that variety. The exceptions to the 90% law are the following varietals: Red and White Bordeaux varietals, Red and White Rhône varietals, Sangiovese, Tempranillo, Zinfandel and Tannat. For these wines, they follow the Federal guidelines of 75%. Oregon law has long forbidden use of place names, except as appellations of origin. Oregon is most famous for its Pinot noir, which is produced throughout the state. Pinot noirs from the Willamette Valley have received much critical acclaim from wine connoisseurs and critics, and Oregon is {{regarded as one of}} the premier Pinot-producing regions in the world.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Wine</b> <b>was</b> {{generally}} {{cut with}} water. The drinking of akraton or [...] "unmixed wine", though {{known to be}} practised by northern barbarians, was thought {{likely to lead to}} madness and death. <b>Wine</b> <b>was</b> mixed in a krater, from which the slaves would fill the drinker's kylix with an oinochoe (jugs). <b>Wine</b> <b>was</b> also thought to have medicinal powers. Aelian mentions that the wine from Heraia in Arcadia rendered men foolish but women fertile; conversely, Achaean <b>wine</b> <b>was</b> thought to induce abortion.|$|R
50|$|After {{the primary}} {{fermentation}} of red grapes the free run <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> pumped off into tanks and the skins are pressed {{to extract the}} remaining juice and wine. The press <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> blended with the free run wine at the winemaker's discretion. The <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> kept warm and the remaining sugars are converted into alcohol and carbon dioxide.|$|R
50|$|The <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> left {{to mature}} in vats or barrels {{for several months}} and {{is not allowed to}} leave the wine sheds before 31 March of the year {{following}} the harvest. Quarterly rackings ensure that the lees held in suspension in the <b>wine</b> <b>are</b> gradually removed. Before being bottled, the <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> filtered and the sulfite level is adjusted.|$|R
5|$|Most of {{the wine}} {{produced}} and consumed from the 1880s was sweet, kosher wine when the Carmel Winery was established, until the 1980s, when more dry or semi-dry wines began to be produced and consumed after {{the introduction of the}} Golan Heights Winery’s first vintage. The winery was the first to focus on planting and making wines from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc, Chardonnay, Pinot noir, white Riesling and Gewürztraminer. These <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> kosher and have won silver and gold medals in international competitions. Israeli wine is now produced by hundreds of wineries, ranging in size from small boutique wineries in the villages to large companies producing over ten million bottles per year, which are also exported worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Riesling <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> often {{consumed}} when young, {{when they}} make a fruity and aromatic wine which may have aromas of green or other apples, grapefruit, peach, gooseberry, honey, rose blossom or cut green grass, and usually a crisp taste due to the high acidity. However, Riesling's naturally high acidity and range of flavours make it suitable for extended aging. International wine expert Michael Broadbent rates aged German Rieslings, some hundreds of years old, highly. Sweet Riesling wines, such as German Trockenbeerenauslese are especially suited for cellaring since the high sugar content provides for additional preservation. However, high quality dry or off-dry Riesling wine is also known to have not just survived but also been enjoyable at an age exceeding 100 years.|$|E
5|$|The crémant {{produced}} in the Languedoc is made according to the Méthode Traditionnelle - formerly known as méthode champenoise, the same method used to produce the Champagne, including a second fermentation in the bottle to encapture the carbon dioxide produced by the yeast - in the small villages around the town of Limoux. The <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> normally composed of 70% Mauzac and a 30% combination of Chardonnay and Chenin blanc. AOC regulations require a year of aging on the lees. The Blanquette de Limoux, when labelled méthode ancestrale, is composed entirely of Mauzac, undergoes only one fermentation and is aged approximately three months less on the lees before the bottling, the actual date being determined by the moon's cycle.|$|E
50|$|In 2016, Móinéir, a fruit <b>wine,</b> <b>was</b> {{launched}} by Wicklow Way Wines. Currently, a strawberry wine, and a blackberry & elderberry <b>wine,</b> <b>are</b> {{produced by the}} company.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} {{drinks are}} not technically cocktails unless <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> secondary by volume to a distilled beverage, since <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> a fermented beverage not a distilled one.|$|R
50|$|Port wine, {{an internationally}} renowned <b>wine,</b> <b>is</b> widely {{accepted}} as the city's dessert wine, {{especially as the}} <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> made along the Douro River which runs through the city.|$|R
5|$|Cabernet Sauvignon {{is grown}} {{in nearly every}} South American country {{including}} Chile, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Peru and Uruguay. In Chile, the wines were historically limited by the excessively high yields that were commonplace throughout the country. As producers begun to concentrate on limiting yields, regional differences began to emerge that distinguished Chilean Cabernets. For vineyard plantings along flat river valleys, the climate of the region {{is the most important}} consideration; as plantings move to higher elevations and along hillsides, soil type is a greater concern. The wines of the Aconcagua region are noted for their ripe fruit but closed, tight structure that needs some time in the bottle to develop. In the Maipo Valley, Cabernet Sauvignon <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> characterized by their pervasive blackcurrant fruit and an earthy, dusty note. In warmer regions, such as the Colchagua Province and around Curicó, the grapes ripen more fully; they produce wines with rich fruit flavors that can be perceived as sweet due to the ripeness of the fruit. The acidity levels of these wines will be lower and the tannins will also be softer, making the wines more approachable at a younger age.|$|E
5|$|In Ontario, Riesling is {{commonly}} used for Icewine, where the wine is noted for its breadth and complexity. Niagara is a major producer of ice wine in general, putting it neck-and-neck with Germany. Late Harvest wines and some sparkling <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> produced with Riesling in Niagara but it is table wines from dry to off-dry that hold the largest share of production. The climate of the region is typically quite warm in the summertime which adds a layer of richness in the wines. It is interesting that the founder of St. Urbanshoff in the Mosel, Herman Weiss, was an early pioneer in Niagara's modern viticulture, selling his strain of Mosel clone Riesling to many producers in west Niagara (these vines are well over 20 years old now). This clone and Niagara's summer heat make for uniquely bright wines and often show up in interesting dry styled versions. Many producers and wine critics will argue that Niagara's best offerings come from the Niagara Escarpment region which encompasses the Short Hills Bench, 20 Mile Bench and Beamsville Bench.|$|E
5|$|Production {{is still}} {{specialized}} in horticultural goods, {{but most of}} the masseiras were substituted by greenhouses and a significant share of the production is exported to other Western European markets. Póvoa de Varzim is part of the ancient Vinho Verde winemaking region, and there is commercial wine production, however local masseira <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> not commercially produced. The inland valley region is committed to milk production and the Agros corporation headquarters of Lactogal, the largest dairy products and milk producer company in the Iberian Peninsula, is located in Espaço Agros and has several departments such as exhibition park and laboratories. In agriculture, the masseira farm fields were developed. This technique increases agricultural yields by using large, rectangular depressions dug into sand dunes, with the spoil piled up into banks surrounding the depression. Grapes are cultivated on the banks to the south, east and west, and trees and reeds on the northern slope act as a windbreak against the prevailing northern wind. Garden crops are grown in the central depression.|$|E
5000|$|... "When {{compared}} {{with data from}} non-drinkers, the cumulative lifetime consumption {{of all types of}} alcohol in grams of ethanol… beer, spirits, red wine and fortified <b>wine</b> <b>was</b> not related to risk. The consumption of white <b>wine</b> <b>was</b> inversely associated with risk…. The uniformly reduced risk estimates for the lifetime number of drinks of white <b>wine</b> <b>were</b> based on small numbers…." ...|$|R

5000|$|Balti <b>Wine</b> <b>is</b> a <b>wine</b> brand {{marketed as}} {{complementary}} with South Asian food, especially curries such as Balti. Launched in 2004, the <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> made in three white and two red varieties with a [...] "chilli rating" [...] index to help consumers select the right wine for their food, {{depending on the}} spiciness of the dish. The <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> made with grapes from Argentina. By the end of 2006, Balti <b>wines</b> <b>was</b> found in 70% of the Indian restaurants in Rusholme's Curry Mile and Sharif had secured distribution contracts in the United States and with Gulf Air and P&O Cruises.|$|R
5|$|While New World Cabernets are {{characterized}} as being drinkable earlier than Bordeaux, premium producers {{such as the}} Californian cult wines will produce wines that need time to age and could potentially develop {{for two to three}} decades. Overall, the majority of Californian Cabernets are meant to be approachable after only a couple of years in the bottle but can still have the potential to improve further over time. Similarly many premium Australian Cabernet will also need at least ten years to develop though many are approachable after two to five years. New Zealand <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> typically meant to be consumed young and will often maintain their green herbal flavors even with extended bottle aging. South American Cabernets have very pronounced fruit flavors when they are young and the best made examples will maintain some of those flavors as they age. South African wines tend to favor more Old World styles and typically require six to eight years' aging before they start to develop further flavors.|$|E
5|$|The Bordeaux wine region {{accounts}} for more than 60% of the Cabernet Sauvignon grown in France. Outside of Bordeaux, Cabernet Sauvignon is found in varying quantities throughout Le Midi and in the Loire Valley. In general, Cabernet Sauvignon <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> lighter and less structured, drinkable much earlier than Bordeaux wine. In the southwest French appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOCs) of Bergerac and Buzet it is used to make rosé wine. In some regions it is used to add flavor and structure to Carignan while it is blended with Négrette in Gaillac and Fronton as well as Tannat in Madiran. In Provence, the grape had some presence in the region in the mid 19th century, when viticulturist Jules Guyot recommended it as a blending partner with Syrah. In recent years, several Midi wine estates, such as Mas de Daumas Gassac have received international acclaim for their Cabernet Sauvignon blended in Hérault, with Rhône grapes like Syrah. It is often made as a single varietal in the vin de pays of the Languedoc. The influence of Australian flying winemakers has been considerable in how Cabernet Sauvignon is treated by some Languedoc wine estates, with some producers making wines that can seem like they are from the New World. Overall, the grape has not exerted it dominance of the region, generally considered less ideally situated to the dry climate than Syrah. The Languedoc producers who give serious consideration to Cabernet Sauvignon, generally rely on irrigation to compensate for the climate.|$|E
25|$|Overall, {{more or less}} {{dry white}} <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> most common among the {{sparkling}} wines, but sparkling rosé and red <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> also produced, as well as wines of varying sweetness.|$|E
50|$|Pelin <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> made {{by mixing}} wine with Artemisia {{absinthium}} (Pelin) during fermentation, giving the wine a bitter, refreshing taste. This <b>wine</b> <b>is</b> popular in Romania from the 1st May until the summer. White wine and red <b>wine</b> can both <b>be</b> flavoured with Pelin.|$|R

50|$|<b>Wine</b> has <b>been</b> {{produced}} {{in this area}} for centuries, due to the strategic position that Mondéjar occupies on the road between Madrid and Valencia. The traditional market for the <b>wines</b> <b>was</b> strictly local. Originally, Mondéjar <b>wines</b> <b>were</b> classified as Vinos de la Tierra, but they acquired official DO status in 1997.|$|R
25|$|According to Claude and Lydia Bourguignon, red <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> {{well suited}} to soil based on {{limestone}} while the best white <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> produced on soils over metamorphic rocks (Alsace, Moselle, Anjou) or volcanic rocks (Tokaj in Hungary and Slovakia).|$|E
25|$|Both red {{and white}} <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> made in Bordeaux. Red Bordeaux is called claret in the United Kingdom. Red <b>wines</b> <b>are</b> {{generally}} made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit verdot, Malbec, and, less commonly in recent years, Carménère.|$|E
