He was also a relative of Sybil, the wife of Pain fitzJohn, who was his heiress. He probably served as a household knight for Robert, the Earl of Gloucester.|$|E
5|$|Three astronauts are {{launched}} into space aboard a rocket designed by Professor Quatermass, but the spacecraft returns to earth {{with only one}} occupant, Victor Carroon (Richard Wordsworth).

5|$|A {{story was}} told that Ælfric {{introduced}} monks into the cathedral church of Christ Church, Canterbury, replacing the secular clerks that {{had taken over the}} foundation during the ninth century. Ælfric is said to have done this on the command of the pope. This story originally dates to soon after the Norman Conquest and originated with the monastic historians of Canterbury, and its veracity is unclear. He likely performed the marriage ceremony of King Æthelred the Unready and Emma of Normandy in 1002. A later tradition held that he consecrated a Bishop of Llandaff and two Bishops of St. David's in Wales, <b>which,</b> <b>if</b> true, would have meant extending Canterbury's jurisdiction into new territory.|$|E
5|$|After the Veterans' Mountain Camp {{was closed}} in the 1960s, the {{property}} was sold off to private owners, turning NY971D into {{little more than a}} private drive. Thus, the road saw little use, handling less than 10 vehicles per day on average. As a result, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) no longer considered the highway worthy of inclusion in the state highway system and began to take steps to remove the highway from the system. On February22, 1999, NYSDOT sent a memorandum to the New York State Senate that laid out the groundwork for a bill <b>which,</b> <b>if</b> passed, would allow NYSDOT to remove NY971D from the state highway system once it was able to transfer ownership and maintenance of the highway to another entity. A bill based on the memo was introduced in the State Senate on March29 and eventually passed by the Senate and the New York State Assembly. The bill was signed into law by Governor George Pataki on July27, 1999. The former routing of NY971D is now officially a private drive.|$|E

5|$|Although most white dwarfs {{are thought}} to be {{composed}} of carbon and oxygen, spectroscopy typically shows that their emitted light comes from an atmosphere which is observed to be either hydrogen or helium dominated. The dominant element is usually at least 1,000 times more abundant than all other elements. As explained by Schatzman in the 1940s, the high surface gravity is thought to cause this purity by gravitationally separating the atmosphere so that heavy elements are below and the lighter above., §5–6 This atmosphere, {{the only part of the}} white dwarf visible to us, is thought to be the top of an envelope which is a residue of the star's envelope in the AGB phase and may also contain material accreted from the interstellar medium. The envelope is believed to consist of a helium-rich layer with mass no more than 1/100 of the star's total mass, <b>which,</b> <b>if</b> the atmosphere is hydrogen-dominated, is overlain by a hydrogen-rich layer with mass approximately 1/10,000 of the stars total mass., §4–5.|$|E
5|$|Another {{leading cause}} of {{blindness}} is Canine glaucoma. This {{is an increase in}} the pressure of the fluid in the eye <b>which,</b> <b>if</b> left untreated, can cause visual impairment and eventual loss of sight. The condition can be inherited (Primary glaucoma) or a secondary condition to a variety of other eye issues including tumors or lens luxation. Both breeds are affected by juvenile cataracts which can occur at up to four years of age. Symptoms can include discoloring of the pupil, and treatment may include surgery to remove the cataract.|$|E
5|$|Another storyline rivalry {{heading into}} Against All Odds {{was for the}} TNA X Division Championship between the champion, A.J. Styles, and the challenger, Christopher Daniels, in a thirty-minute Iron Man match. An Iron Man match {{involves}} two competitors fighting for a predetermined amount of time, in this case thirty-minutes, after which whoever gained more pinfalls or submissions is the victor. The rivalry for this match began on the January 21 episode of Impact!, when Daniels challenged Styles to a match that night, in <b>which</b> <b>if</b> Styles could not defeat him in under ten-minutes then Daniels got a X Division Championship match at Against All Odds. The match ended in a time limit draw, which meant per the pre-match stipulation Daniels gained a championship match at Against All Odds. Dusty Rhodes then entered the arena after the match and announced that the contest would be a thirty-minute Iron Man match.|$|E

The phenomenon of drunk driving and fatigue driving {{becomes more and more}} serious, and the improvement for steering wheel could effectively prevent traffic accidents. This paper introduces and analyzes the intelligence of steering wheel in three major aspects, they respectively include intelligent grip detection, <b>which</b> tests <b>if</b> a driver is of fatigue driving; hart rate detection, <b>which</b> tests <b>if</b> a driver is in normal driving condition; alcohol detection, <b>which</b> tests <b>if</b> a driver drinks too much, and it predicts the possibility of accident from the driver’s state, and timely gives out signal to warn the driver...|$|R

Similarly, subscribers express interest {{in one or more}} classes and only receive messages that are of interest, without knowledge of <b>which</b> publishers, <b>if</b> any, there are.|$|R
5|$|At Destination X, Robert Roode fought Booker T in a Stand By Your Man Strap match. Cornette {{announced}} on the February 14 episode of Impact!, that Booker T and Roode would {{face in a}}nother match at Destination X. On the March 6, 2008, episode of Impact!, Cornette announced that Booker T and Roode would face in a Stand By Your Man Strap match, in <b>which</b> <b>if</b> Booker T won then Traci Brooks {{would be allowed to}} beat Payton Banks with a strap ten times and vice versa. Roode won the bout at Destination X. After the contest, Sharmell returned from injury attacking Roode and Banks. This resulted in an Intergender Tag Team Six Sides of Steel Cage match at TNA's Lockdown PPV event on April 13, 2008 pitting Roode and Banks against Booker T and Sharmell, which the later team won.|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines {{are used}} recreationally and by {{problematic}} drug misusers. Mortality is higher among poly-drug misusers that also use benzodiazepines. Heavy alcohol use also increases mortality among poly-drug users. Dependence and tolerance, often coupled with dosage escalation, to benzodiazepines can develop rapidly among drug misusers; withdrawal syndrome may appear after {{as little as}} three weeks of continuous use. Long-term use {{has the potential to}} cause both physical and psychological dependence and severe withdrawal symptoms such as depression, anxiety (often to the point of panic attacks), and agoraphobia. Benzodiazepines and, in particular, temazepam are sometimes used intravenously, <b>which,</b> <b>if</b> done incorrectly or in an unsterile manner, can lead to medical complications including abscesses, cellulitis, thrombophlebitis, arterial puncture, deep vein thrombosis, and gangrene. Sharing syringes and needles for this purpose also brings up the possibility of transmission of hepatitis, HIV, and other diseases. Benzodiazepines are also misused intranasally, which may have additional health consequences. Once benzodiazepine dependence has been established, a clinician usually converts the patient to an equivalent dose of diazepam before beginning a gradual reduction program.|$|E
5|$|Cold shock {{response}} is the physiological response of organisms to sudden cold, especially cold water, {{and is a}} common cause of death from immersion in very cold water, such as by falling through thin ice. The immediate shock of the cold causes involuntary inhalation, <b>which</b> <b>if</b> underwater can result in drowning. The cold water can also cause heart attack due to vasoconstriction; the heart has {{to work harder to}} pump the same volume of blood throughout the body, and for people with heart disease, this additional workload can cause the heart to go into arrest. A person who survives the initial minute after falling into cold water can survive for at least thirty minutes provided they do not drown. The ability to stay afloat declines substantially after about ten minutes as the chilled muscles lose strength and co-ordination.|$|E

5|$|Following No Surrender, Raven {{went on to}} {{feud with}} Jeff Jarrett and Rhino. Jarrett and Rhino {{attacked}} Raven on the July 22 episode of Impact!, claiming he had no allies to help him. On the July 29 episode of Impact!, Jarrett and Rhino attacked Cassidy Riley as well, until Raven announced he had chosen a partner to team {{with him in a}} Tag Team match to face Jarrett and Rhino at TNA's next PPV event Sacrifice on August 14. Sabu then appeared attacking Jarrett and Rhino with Raven. At Sacrifice, NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zbyszko added a stipulation to the encounter, in <b>which</b> <b>if</b> Jarrett pinned Raven he would earn a future NWA World Heavyweight Championship match, however, if Raven pinned Jarrett then he would not garner one for an entire year. The team of Jarrett and Rhino won the contest at the event, with Rhino gaining the pinfall victory.|$|E
5|$|He {{was offered}} the job as manager of Second Division club Middlesbrough on his 38th {{birthday}} in 1973. He {{declined to be interviewed}} for the position, and instead handed the club a list of responsibilities he expected to take, <b>which</b> <b>if</b> agreed to would give him total control of the running of the club. He refused a contract, and would never sign a contract throughout his managerial career. He took a salary of £10,000 a year despite the chairman being willing to pay a lot more; his only stipulations were a gentleman's agreement that he would not be sacked, assurances that he would have no interference from the board in team affairs, and three days off a week for fishing and shooting. He decided to first repaint Ayresome Park and to publicise the upcoming league campaign so as to generate higher attendance figures.|$|E
