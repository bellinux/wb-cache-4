5|$|In 2008, Federer {{captured}} one Grand Slam, a singles {{title at}} the US Open over Briton Andy Murray. Federer {{was defeated by}} Nadal in two Grand Slam finals, at the French Open, and at Wimbledon, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> for six straight wins to break Björn Borg's record. At the Australian Open, Federer lost in the semifinals to eventual winner Djokovic, which ended his record of 10 consecutive finals. Later in the year, it was found Federer had been suffering from mononucleosis {{at the start of}} the year, particularly during the Australian Open. He lost twice in Masters Series 1000 finals on clay to Nadal, at Monte Carlo and Hamburg. However, Federer captured three titles in 250-level events at Estoril, Halle, and Basel.|$|E
25|$|Finally assenting {{to place}} him in {{competition}} against fighters {{of his own}} weight class, Pride management put him against French jiu jitsu champion Gilles Arsene in a bout Sakuraba dominated and then against Rickson Gracie protege, Antonio Schembri. With a win over Schembri, it was speculated that Sakuraba might be then groomed for a championship fight in a new weight division for fighters of his size. Sakuraba controlled the fight initially, landing plenty of hits and breaking Antonio's nose, but <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{for one of his}} trademark Mongolian chops, Schembri stunned him with a series of knee strikes (controversially preceded by an illegal headbutt), winning by TKO.|$|E
25|$|Later, Gregory Douglas, a {{journalist}} who interviewed former CIA operative Robert Crowley {{over a period of}} 4 years, recorded their telephone conversations and published a transcription in a book titled Conversations with the Crow. In the book, Crowley claimed that the CIA was responsible for eliminating Homi Bhabha, an Indian nuclear scientist whose plane crashed into Alps, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to attend a conference in Vienna; and Lal Bahadur Shastri. Crowley said that the USA was wary of India's rigid stand on nuclear policy and of then prime minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, who wanted to go ahead with nuclear tests. He also said that the agency was worried about collective domination by India and Russia over the region, for which a strong deterrent was required.|$|E

500|$|Tennant {{started to}} write the song when he was staying at his cousin's house in Nottingham while {{watching}} a gangster film. Just <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to sleep {{he came up with}} the lines: [...] "Sometimes you're better off dead, there's a gun in your hand and it's pointing at your head". The lyrics were inspired by T.S. Eliot's poem The Waste Land, particularly in the use of different narrative voices and arcane references. The song's lyrics are largely concerned with class, inner-city pressure. Tennant later said that some listeners had assumed the song referred to prostitutes, but was actually, [...] "about rough boys getting a bit of posh." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 1904, {{on his way}} to Ann Arbor, Michigan (the home of the University of Michigan), Schulz {{recalled}} that he stopped in Chicago, Illinois, where he spent four days drinking beer and generally having a [...] "swell time". [...] A group of Michigan representatives eventually found him in Chicago and put him on the next train to Ann Arbor. [...] When he arrived in Ann Arbor, Yost was furious and accused Schulz of flirting with Amos Alonzo Stagg, the legendary coach of the University of Chicago. [...] Schulz was immediately taken out to Michigan's training camp at Whitmore Lake and kept asking Yost <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to be allowed to register. [...] Yost told Schulz that he had taken care of it. [...] According to Schulz, he was registered two weeks before he ever saw the campus.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} version of [...] "Diamonds from Sierra Leone" [...] is largely free-associative and {{is filled with}} a litany of lyrical punchlines which serve to loosely chronicle his past experiences {{being a part of}} the Roc-A-Fella family, from touring with Jay-Z on his Blueprint Lounge Tour to the label's subsequent fall out and revival. However, West uses the remix to [...] "Diamonds from Sierra Leone" [...] to directly address the issue of [...] "blood diamonds" [...] that people unknowingly wear every day are used to fund horrific civil wars in West Africa. Lyrically, the extensive, uplifting [...] "We Major" [...] is a spiritual exhultation of generational and personal success. [...] "Hey Mama" [...] is West's dedication to his mother, Donda West. In the ballad, West recounts past hardships he and his mother suffered through together and [...] expresses his love and devotion for her and appreciation for her tireless support, even <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> directly against her expectations for him.|$|E

500|$|... "Make Me Over" [...] was {{inspired}} by the band's love of British rock, while strains of [...] "Learn You Inside Out" [...] were inspired by the Plastic Ono Band. When asked about the song [...] "Learn You Inside Out", Wade said, [...] "I wrote it really quick. We decided just to freestyle. It was one of those moments when we really grew as a band, being able to reach each other and know where we're going." [...] The song [...] "Disarray" [...] {{was inspired}} by Wade's strict and religious family. When asked about the song, he said, [...] "Angels, demons. We all fight them both, and anyone who pretends they don’t is not someone I want to hang out with." [...] "Storm" [...] was originally written by Wade at the age of sixteen, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> through difficult times. When asked about the song in an interview, Wade said, [...] "That was fun to record because of its starkness. We love the idea of the title, surrounded by negative space, like the a cappella beginning. Because when you’re lost in confusion, no matter how much is going on around you, you’re still alone." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hrithik Roshan {{elaborated}} on {{his character}} {{saying that he}} was [...] ".. a super character in the film. I have interacted with about 20 such patients who suffer from complete paralysis of {{the lower half of the}} body, including both legs which is mostly caused by damage of the spinal cord. They are real life superheroes and I am representing their emotions on screen". Adding that he never had felt such responsibility towards any other character he had played to date, he told the media that the film did not take any stance on mercy-killing. Roshan said that he was able to identify with Ethan Mascarenhas because, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> through the Guzaarish script, he had been nursing a knee problem and doctors told him that the knee will never be okay. According to Roshan, the script [...] "..energised me so much that I was not depressed about my knee problem anymore".|$|E
2500|$|Vyjayanthimala {{commented that}} [...] "his {{death is a}} big loss to the industry. It's my bad luck that I didn't {{have the chance to}} work with him because he came much later. I {{remember}} when he came to Chennai for some film shoot, the college girls went crazy {{to catch a glimpse of}} him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to his studio." [...] Manna Dey said: [...] "He was a great actor, truly a superstar, no doubt about it. I am honoured to have done playback for him. I have worked for him in several movies, and actors like him are a rarity." [...] Mrinal Sen recollected how Khanna had wanted to cast him in one of his films, but the latter could not manage due to date problems. [...] "We had met several times. Once I had wanted to cast him in one of my films, but somehow that didn't work out due to his date problems." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gwynn and Clark {{said they}} could {{continue}} to play together, but Clark signed with the Boston Red Sox {{as a free agent}} in the offseason. Gwynn felt appreciated after he was signed to a three-year contract extension for $12.25 million, including a $1 million signing bonus. McKeon praised Gwynn, saying, [...] "He's one of the most unselfish players I've ever managed. In '89, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> for a batting title, he was giving himself up to move runners along." [...] Dick Williams, who managed Gwynn from 1982 through 1985, said of Gwynn, [...] "I don't think I've ever had a player who worked harder, cared more and was more deserving of his awards." [...] Clark continued to criticize him, which Gwynn attributed to jealousy. Gwynn responded with his own criticism of Clark: [...] "Let's talk about him walking 104 times, being a No. 4 hitter. Let's talk about his not flying on team flights. Let's talk about him getting booted out of games on a called strike three." [...] In 1992, Gwynn sympathized with Clark, who filed for bankruptcy after bad loans by his agent. [...] "I really appreciated the things Tony said about my situation", Clark said.|$|E

40|$|Purpose of {{this work}} was the {{realization}} of stress and strenght analysis of the bike frame {{with the help of}} the basic elasticity approach. At first I had to transfer this task from three-dimensional to two-dimensional and also to simplify to fulfill the beam conditions. I also focused on static safety of the construction. This static safety was solved for two loading modes. First one was define as the load, which cyclist can induce, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on the direct road. Second one was defined as the load, which <b>he</b> can induce, <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> up to the hill. I used for these calculations mathematical software such as Mathcad 14 or Maple 12, but also modeling software especially Autocad for establishing correct dimensions. At the end I checked the stress and strain analysis obtained by the basic elasticity approach with the solution performed making use of the ANSYS software code...|$|R

2500|$|Wolverine makes a brief {{appearance}} in [...] as Weapon X. Having somehow been captured by Stryker at some point, {{he has been}} given an adamantium skeleton and subject to brutal mental conditioning, leaving him operating on a more feral state than a human level. When some of the adult X-Men are captured by Stryker's men, Jean, Scott and Kurt Wagner are able to infiltrate Stryker's base and find Logan's cage, with Jean sensing the human mind underneath the conditioning and releasing him {{so that he can}} help. After Weapon X tears his way through Stryker's forces, the three teens find him at a small side-exit to the base, Jean's telepathy to restore some of Logan's human memories before he runs off into the snow. Writer Simon Kinberg explained that the character was originally intended to have a larger role in the film, saying [...] "There was always a notion that we wanted Wolverine to be in the movie. We wanted {{to find a way to}} feature him in the film, partly because Bryan [...] and I love Hugh [...] so much. We love the character, obviously, and he’s such a huge part of the franchise. There were a lot of iterations of how Wolverine would enter and exit the movie. There was a version <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to come in at the midpoint of the film and be like the drill sergeant for the kids and take over as their leader. And we felt like that stepped on Jennifer Lawrence's role in the movie and becoming their leader".|$|E
2500|$|In one storyline, Nicole Travis Drake was {{victimized by}} two {{different}} women, Stephanie Martin (Alice Hirson) and Pamela Stewart (Irene Dailey), who both wanted Nicole dead. Nicole was then accused of murdering Stephanie Martin. Adam Drake defended her and proved her innocence, when he proved Pamela Stewart had murdered Stephanie. [...] Adam then {{broke away from}} Mike Karr's law firm as partner and opened his own law practice. He hired Nicole as his secretary, and a romance blossomed. When Nicole sensed his {{lack of interest in}} marriage, she went to work for another attorney, Jake Berman (Ward Costello). [...] She continued to date Adam and told him if he did not propose to her by New Year's Eve, their relationship was finished. [...] She soon got another marriage proposal from her new boss, widower Jake Berman. She did not accept, but moved to New York City with him <b>when</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to partner at an existing law firm. [...] Adam then searched for Nicole in New York until he found her at the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve and proposed to her. When Adam and Nicole returned to Monticello, so did Jake, determined to prevent them from marrying. He plotted with exconvict Johnny Dallas (John LaGioia) to frame Adam for attempted murder. Johnny did not show up, but Jake was murdered by Joel Gantry (Paul Henry Itkin, Nicholas Pryor) and Adam was arrested for the murder immediately following Nicole and his wedding at the Karr residence. [...] The day before the jury would find Adam guilty, Joel Gantry was found by Kevin Jamison (Dick Shoberg) in San Francisco, who was really Edith Berman's son and convinced Jake had murdered his mother. Adam and Nicole reunited and settled into married life. [...] Sometime later, she was believed to have died in a boating accident in the Caribbean, but was discovered alive 18 months later by Kevin Jamison (then played by John Driver) in France at the same time Adam proposed to Assistant District Attorney Brandy Henderson (Dixie Carter). Adam and Nicole eventually reunited about six months after Nicole was discovered alive, and Brandy left town another six months later. [...] Their marriage ended as Adam was murdered. The character of Nicole was replaced with a new actress and was subsequently reduced in age a decade, a rarity for an adult character in the genre. Now younger and more vibrant, Nicole was suitable for a relationship with young doctor Miles Cavanaugh. Nicole was eventually killed off when her makeup powder was poisoned.|$|E
