2500|$|In 1924, Livens {{invented a}} small {{dishwasher}} {{suitable for use}} in a domestic setting. It had all the features of a modern dishwasher, including a front door for loading, a <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> <b>to</b> hold crockery and a rotating sprayer. According to family tradition, [...] Livens built a prototype {{for the benefit of the}} family. When it was tried out by their maidservant, she was later found in tears with water flooding across the floor; at that point the experiment was abandoned.|$|E
50|$|In the United Kingdom, William Howard Livens {{invented a}} small, non-electric {{dishwasher}} suitable for domestic use in 1924. It {{was the first}} dishwasher that incorporated most of the design elements that are featured in the models of today; it included a front door for loading, a <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> <b>to</b> hold the dirty crockery and a rotating sprayer. Drying elements were even added to his design in 1940. It was the first machine suitable for domestic use, and it {{came at a time}} when permanent plumbing and running water in the house was becoming increasingly common.|$|E
50|$|Pockets, usually rimmed at {{the back}} with leather or plastic, may have leather mesh or cloth bags or plastic cups, or {{elongated}} <b>wire</b> <b>racks,</b> <b>to</b> catch the balls, common in home billiard rooms and pool halls, or in the coin-operated tables found in bars/pubs may instead lead to ball-return troughs inside the table, which channel the balls into a collection chamber {{on one side of}} the table (or, in non-coin-op models, on the racking end of the table). A disadvantage to pockets with bags or cups is that if too many balls go into the same pocket, it will fill up the receptacle and prevent any more balls from going in that pocket, requiring that some be moved out of the pocket manually before shooting again.|$|R
50|$|Sliding racks are {{typically}} {{used for the}} storage of framed works of art, where works are hung on a <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> connected <b>to</b> tracks that are suspended from channels {{on the floor and}} ceiling, which keeps the racks from swaying. This type of system allows great variation, as the distance between racks can be adjusted to accommodate large or small frames, and works can be organized {{to make the most of}} the space while keeping them in their upright position to avoid damage. These types of sliding rack systems can also be a closed unit, where the end of each rack has a panel with a gasket and closed walls at either end, or each individual rack can be a sealed space in itself, which is typically used for textile display or visible storage systems, where the objects are encased in a transparent rack. Mobile racks can also be utilized to hang textiles, where the textiles can either be draped over a bar, or supported by hooks attached <b>to</b> frames. <b>Racks</b> can also be mounted to the walls of storage spaces, utilizing the perimeter space of a storage area, which is safest for framed objects that should not be moved often, such as framed pastel drawings.|$|R

50|$|Specialist {{marketing}} {{companies in}} many countries produce and distribute advertising postcards which are available for free. These are normally offered on <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> displays in plazas, coffee shops and other commercial locations, usually {{not intended to be}} mailed.|$|R
40|$|A {{simulation}} model {{was built to}} represent the dynamics of a General Electric (GE) dishwasher <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> production system associated with multiple types of racks and changeovers at the various work centers. A periodic-review inventory policy was simulated for the <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> production system using order-up-to safety stock SSi and a heuristic trigger variable P ∗ as the control variables. A discrete optimization model was formulated and executed {{in order to find}} near optimal values for the control variables with respect to minimization of the total inventory levels while satisfying constraints on demand for the various types of racks. Three different scenarios involving optimization of the {{simulation model}} were conducted to help GE improve their production strategy. ...|$|R
5000|$|Main {{distribution}} frame (MDF): a <b>wiring</b> <b>rack</b> that connects outside subscriber lines with internal lines. It {{is used to}} connect public or private lines coming into the building to internal networks. At the telco, the MDF is generally in proximity to the cable vault and {{not far from the}} telephone switch.|$|R
50|$|Pre-heat {{the oven}} to 200°C and bake the bread for 30-40 minutes. The bread should sound hollow when tapped if it is fully cooked. Return the bread to the oven (out of the tin) for a further 5-10 minutes to crisp up the base and sides. Leave to cool on a <b>wire</b> <b>rack.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{publication}} {{was established}} in November 1981 as a spinoff of the now-defunct WXPN Express newsletter. Philadelphia City Paper distributed 70,000 copies in more than 2,000 locations throughout Philadelphia, its suburbs and South Jersey. Its more than 2,000 orange-colored boxes and <b>wire</b> <b>racks</b> were found in Center City Philadelphia, in cafes, small businesses and on many university campuses.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, Lee created a product called [...] "Sandra Lee Kraft Kurtains", a home-decorating tool that used a <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> and sheets or other fabric samples to create {{decorative}} drapery. The product was sold via infomercials and cable shopping networks. Home-shopping network QVC hired her as on-air talent; {{in her first}} 18 months on the network, Lee sold $20 million worth of products.|$|R
50|$|Decorative bright nickel {{is used in}} a {{wide range}} of applications. It offers a high luster finish, {{corrosion}} protection, and wear resistance. In the automotive industry bright nickel can be found on bumpers, rims, exhaust pipes and trim. It is also used for bright work on bicycles and motorcycles. Other applications include hand tools and household items such as lighting and plumbing fixtures, <b>wire</b> <b>racks,</b> firearms, and appliances.|$|R
50|$|A typical {{standard}} central vacuum system {{is equipped with}} a 30 foot (9 m) hose, plus standard cleaning tools similar to those used with portable vacuum cleaners. For further convenience, some owners will keep a hose and set of tools on each floor of a multi-story building. When not in use, the hose is loosely coiled around a <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> mounted on a closet wall, or {{on the back of a}} door.|$|R
5000|$|Dutton, {{the son of}} {{a banking}} lawyer, was born in the Society Hill {{neighborhood}} of Philadelphia, and began playing guitar at age eight. He wrote his first song {{by the time he was}} in the ninth grade and began playing harmonica in a <b>wire</b> <b>rack.</b> Dutton credits Bob Dylan and John Hammond Jr., as well as the then-contemporary [...] "old school" [...] hip-hop sounds of Run-DMC, the Beastie Boys, and Philadelphia's own Schoolly D, as influences.|$|R
5000|$|Toaster oven: Toaster ovens {{are small}} {{electric}} ovens with a front door, <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> and removable baking pan. To toast bread with a toaster oven, {{slices of bread}} are placed horizontally on the rack. When the toast is done, the toaster turns off, {{but in most cases}} the door must be opened manually. Most toaster ovens are significantly larger than toasters, but are capable of performing most of the functions of electric ovens, albeit on a much smaller scale.|$|R
5000|$|Condition: the <b>wire</b> <b>racks</b> of grocery, drug, and toy {{stores were}} often {{only half the}} height of comic books, {{resulting}} in bent spines and dog-eared pages. In contrast, direct market retail outlets usually attempt to maintain their inventory in good condition. Their shelves are often the full height of the comic book. Many stores also included backing boards and mylar bags to further protect comics upon purchase (a practice {{that began in the}} 1980s and continues in some shops today).|$|R
25|$|It is {{possible}} for metal objects to be microwave-oven compatible, although experimentation by users is not encouraged. Microwaving an individual smooth metal object without pointed ends, for example, a spoon or shallow metal pan, usually does not produce sparking. Thick metal <b>wire</b> <b>racks</b> {{can be part of}} the interior design in microwave ovens (see illustration). In a similar way, the interior wall plates with perforating holes which allow light and air into the oven, and allow interior-viewing through the oven door, are all made of conductive metal formed in a safe shape.|$|R
50|$|Each {{passenger}} {{unit was}} equipped with adjustable seating, internal heating, non-draught windows, water tanks for drinking or washing, along with ample luggage storage in overhead <b>wire</b> <b>racks.</b> At least when new, the engines did not cause any vibration in the passenger compartments. The lighting system was powered by the then-standard Victorian Railways' 24vDC supply via belt-driven axle generators, with 20-watt globes. Trailer cars were not fitted with their own power supply, instead drawing power via jumper cables from adjacent units; the exceptions being 54 and 56MT, which {{are thought to have}} had batteries.|$|R

50|$|Fort Collins Weekly {{published}} {{its first}} issue on March 5, 2003. It {{was founded by}} publisher Joel Dyer and editor-in-chief Greg Campbell and operated for its first year from a small office on Oak Street in Old Town Fort Collins. The initial print run was 20,000 papers distributed free in newspaper boxes and <b>wire</b> <b>racks</b> throughout the city. Circulation grew along with its staff and in September 2004, the Weekly relocated to offices in the historic Miller Block Building at 11 Old Town Square. In December 2007, 33,700 copies of the paper were printed, with 28,200 mailed directly to city residents and the remaining 5,500 distributed on the street.|$|R

5000|$|Three {{optional}} accessories {{were available}} for the G-101: a travel bag, an expression pedal (volume pedal), {{and a set of}} bass pedals. The volume pedal had a spring-loaded side-lever {{that could be used to}} actuate the [...] "Glide" [...] and [...] "Trumpet Wow-wow" [...] effects. The 1/4" [...] TRS jack also enabled users to connect a Gibson [...] "Sabre" [...] amp, or one of two external reverb units made by both Gibson and Maestro (which manufactured the Echoplex), as well as to any standard guitar or keyboard amplifier. The [...] "Reverb" [...] tab would be used to activate one of these. The G-101 had no onboard reverb unit. The instrument's top had a removable, fold-down <b>wire</b> <b>rack</b> for sheet music.|$|R
