5|$|<b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about Goya, {{who painted}} the most horrendous {{pictures}} {{of violence and}} torture and so forth, and they're amazing, exquisite paintings, {{one of the reasons}} they're such wonderful paintings is because what he's saying is, 'Look– look at this.' So if you paint it badly or put it in the sort of wrong perspective, you draw more attention to what's wrong with the image rather than looking at the image.|$|E

But her sensitivity! Even if she could not see, she sensed the music and always came in exactly with my downbeat. When we rehearsed, she was so precise, already note-perfect... She {{was not just a}} singer, but a complete artist. It's foolish to discuss her as a voice. She must be viewed totally—as a complex of music, drama, movement. There is no one like her today. She was an esthetic phenomenon.|$|E

(Or, {{in the case of the}} dog, just, well, murder her.) Without her, though, the show wouldn't be half as interesting. Just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you've seen every bit of crazy Jenny can dish out, she digs deep and finds some new neuroticism. She's fragile, but she's steel-spined when it comes to accepting responsibility for the havoc she wreaks in her life and everyone else's." ...|$|E

500|$|Electro was {{voiced by}} Crispin Freeman, {{who sought to}} reflect in his vocal style the {{psychological}} decline {{brought on by the}} character's new powers: [...] "It never occurred to me before how that would have an effect on his character [...] to be dealing with that curse and blessing. And <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about it, that's also Peter Parker's core issue." [...] The episode's title, [...] "Interactions," [...] expands the series theme [...] "The Education of Peter Parker" [...] chosen by developer Greg Weisman. Episodes in the early season one arc all shared a naming scheme based on the biological sciences.|$|E
500|$|As with {{previous}} ceremonies he produced, Cates centered the show around a theme. This year, he christened {{the show with}} the theme [...] "Togetherness of Moviegoing" [...] commenting, [...] "The thing that's kind of wonderful about movies is that you watch them with other people. The only other areas where you do that, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about it, are religion and sports." [...] He concluded by noting that the movie theater is [...] "a wonderful place where you come together to laugh, to cry." [...] In tandem with the theme, actress Winona Ryder presented a montage featuring film clips from Matinee, Casablanca, and A Streetcar Named Desire depicting audiences inside a movie theater.|$|E
500|$|Clocking in at {{over two}} hours in length and {{containing}} 34 tracks, The Astonishing was planned as an immersive experience that would be best enjoyed as a full album {{as opposed to a}} collection of singles. The album plays out similarly to a film, with Loudwire observing, [...] "It’s an enormous amount of music to absorb in one sitting, but <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about it, most movies are around {{two hours in}} length, and The Astonishing is very much like a movie in the way it delivers the storyline." [...] Certain songs, such as [...] "A Savior in the Square" [...] and [...] "Our New World", have reoccurring themes, while others stand more on their own in order to move the plot along.|$|E

The lyrics are written in a form of an [...] "open letter" [...] in which the singer praises her mother's courage for ending a dysfunctional marriage. At the beginning of the song, Beyoncé sings, [...] "Mama, I understand your many sleepless nights / <b>When</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about father / and how you tried to be the perfect wife... I wish you didn’t hurt at all." [...] Alex Frank of Vogue noted how the song was thematically [...] "an enlightened follow-up" [...] to [...] "Single Ladies", discussing a similar private subject matter for the singer.

500|$|Weiner {{said that}} the episode is [...] "about the {{children}}. It's about {{who is going to}} take care of the children. Youth is a big part of our lives in general. Now and then. But <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of the sixties and the youth culture and the way it sort of takes over. What you're looking at is Don's fear of the children being cut loose. At the same time, the children come back and eat you." [...] Weiner commented that the Michael Ginsberg character was [...] "of the next wave" [...] as a youthful employee who is [...] "unfamiliar with social rules", with Weiner also declaring that [...] "there is no reason that the concerns of older people are different than younger people".|$|E
500|$|On November 25, 2002, Smith was {{involved}} in a brawl with the Los Angeles Police Department at a concert where The Flaming Lips and Beck were performing. Smith later said he was defending a man he thought the police were harassing. The officers allegedly beat and arrested him and Chiba. The two spent the night in jail. Smith's back was injured in the incident, causing him to cancel a number of shows. Wayne Coyne, lead singer of The Flaming Lips and a friend of Smith's, stated concern over Smith's appearance and actions, saying that he [...] "saw a guy who had lost control of himself. He was needy, he was grumpy, he was everything you wouldn't want in a person. It's not like <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of Keith Richards being pleasantly blissed out in the corner." ...|$|E

500|$|An inexperienced Jennings had a {{hard time}} keeping up with his rivals at the other networks, and he – and the upstart ABC News – could not compete with the venerable newscasts of Walter Cronkite at CBS and Chet Huntley and David Brinkley at NBC. Some in the American {{audience}} disliked Jennings' Canadian accent. He pronounced lieutenant as [...] "leftenant", mangled the pronunciation of [...] "Appomattox," [...] and misidentified the [...] "Marines' Hymn" [...] as [...] "Anchors Aweigh" [...] at Lyndon Johnson's presidential inauguration; his lack of in-depth knowledge of American affairs and culture led critics to deride Jennings as a [...] "glamorcaster". [...] "It was a little ridiculous <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about it," [...] he later reflected. [...] "A 26-year-old trying to compete with Cronkite, Huntley and Brinkley. I was simply unqualified. After three rocky years at the anchor desk, Jennings quit to become a foreign correspondent.|$|E
500|$|Chris Robinson and Robb Buono, the film's {{production}} designer, {{decided that}} the script was composed of two distinct parts— {{the reality of the}} teens' lives and the time they spent at the skating rink. According to Buono, [...] "we wanted to look at it [...] through rose colored glasses, because <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> back on your memories of that time period— no matter what age you are— you see everything bigger. Our goal was to make that roller skating rink a character that grows as we keep coming back, and each time it’s more magical— a Saturday Night Fever-like contrast to the reality of life.” Robinson and Buono chose to shoot at the Cascade Family Skating Rink in Atlanta after visiting and witnessing the energy and excitement of the rink. However, the filmmakers felt Cascade's interior design was too bland and decided it should be redesigned.|$|E
500|$|Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal {{called it}} [...] "A first-rate action thriller, a vivid {{evocation}} of urban warfare in Iraq, a penetrating study of heroism and {{a showcase for}} austere technique, terse writing and a trio of brilliant performances." [...] The Toronto Star critic Peter Howell said, [...] "Just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> the battle of Iraq war dramas has been fought and lost, along comes one that demands to be seen... If you can sit through The Hurt Locker without your heart nearly pounding through your chest, you must be made of granite." [...] Entertainment Weeklys film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the film the rare [...] "A" [...] rating, calling it, [...] "an intense, action-driven war pic, a muscular, efficient standout that simultaneously conveys the feeling of combat from within {{as well as what}} it looks like on the ground. This ain't no war videogame." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the show}} were often favorable, noting it was fun {{entertainment}} for the family. After Double Dare premiered, Kenneth R. Clark, media writer for the Chicago Tribune, observed that when contestants [...] "squeal and make faces, it is somehow natural, wholesome and infectious," [...] and said, [...] "Double Dare is so refreshing." [...] Noel Holston of the Minneapolis Star and Tribune wrote that [...] "kids and game shows, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> about it, go together like hot fudge and ice cream". The Orange County Registers Ellen T. Klein said Double Dare is [...] "such fast-paced, furious and messy fun" [...] and rated the show as [...] "good". In 1988, television critic Ken Tucker cited the interaction between, and the performances of host Marc Summers and announcer Harvey as [...] "the not-so-secret ingredients in the show's success in drawing adult, as well as youthful, viewers".|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Lindsay Doran, the new {{president}} of production company Mirage Enterprises, was on a company retreat brainstorming potential film ideas when she suggested the Jane Austen novel Sense and Sensibility to her colleagues. It had been adapted three times, most recently in a 1981 television serial. Doran was a longtime fan of the novel, and had vowed in her youth to adapt it if she ever entered the film industry. She chose to adapt this particular Austen work because there were two female leads. Doran stated that [...] "all of [...] books are funny and emotional, but Sense and Sensibility is the best movie story because it's full of twists and turns. Just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> you know what's going on, everything is different. It's got real suspense, but it's not a thriller. Irresistible." [...] She also praised the novel for possessing [...] "wonderful characters... three strong love stories, surprising plot twists, good jokes, relevant themes, and a heart-stopping ending." ...|$|E
500|$|Blu-ray.com's Casey Broadwater {{called it}} a [...] "strong character-centric episode," [...] and added that the episode's title {{is one of his}} [...] "favourites." [...] Writing for Project-Blu, Nate Boss wrote [...] "Just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> The Simpsons is broke, we get Angry Dad. To quote Stan Lee: 'Broke? Or made it BETTER?' That's right. Stan 'the man' Lee." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B+, {{describing}} [...] "Homer's random exclamation while running around on fire, 'Oh, I hope no one's drawing this!'" [...] as the episode's [...] "highlight." [...] Ryan Keefer of DVD Talk described the episode as being [...] "flat out funny." [...] Lee's appearance in the episode was also praised. Rayner called his performance [...] "one of the all time great cameos," [...] and Jacobson called it [...] "fun." [...] Broadwater considered Lee's appearance {{to be one of the}} season's [...] "highlights," [...] and Total Films Nathan Ditum ranked Lee's performance as the 12th best guest appearance in the show's history, describing it as [...] "a deranged, childish and brilliant version of himself." ...|$|E

500|$|Regarded as an auteur filmmaker, Nolan's visual style often emphasises urban settings, men in suits, muted colours, {{dialogue}} scenes {{framed in}} wide close-up with a shallow {{depth of field}} and modern locations and architecture. Aesthetically, the director favours deep, evocative shadows, documentary-style lighting, natural settings and real filming locations over studio work. Nolan has noted {{that many of his}} films are heavily influenced by film noir. He has continuously experimented with metafictive elements, temporal shifts, elliptical cutting, solipsistic perspectives, nonlinear storytelling, labyrinthine plots and the merging of style and form. Discussing The Tree of Life (2011), Nolan spoke of Terrence Malick's work and how it has influenced his own approach to style, [...] "When you think of a visual style, <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of the visual language of a film, there tends to be a natural separation of the visual style and the narrative elements. But with the greats, whether it's Stanley Kubrick or Terrence Malick or Hitchcock, what you're seeing is an inseparable, a vital relationship between the image and the story it's telling".|$|E
500|$|SFScope {{contributor}} Sarah Stegall {{believed the}} episode [...] "got us quickly {{back on track}} after last week's lackluster tale," [...] and called the killer revelation the greatest shock she has received on the series thus far. She continued {{that one of her}} favorite parts of the Peter-as-a-killer arc is being able to watch the emotional setbacks he is facing as a result of Fauxlivia's betrayal; she called it [...] "good characterization, and excellent acting". However, Stegall questioned why Massive Dynamic would build a machine known to be the destroyer of mankind. IGN columnist Ramsey Isler praised the writing staff because [...] "just <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> they might be stuck in old habits, they come up with new ideas and put a whole new perspective on old storylines and characters." [...] Isler continued that while [...] "'Reciprocity'" [...] isn't the most groundbreaking episode in the series, it does try a number of new ideas, and it gives us one big new plot point that could change the tone {{of the rest of the}} season." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "an {{unsurpassed}} episode. It's hard {{to know where to}} start dishing out the praise— Leonard Nimoy's guest appearance, the Monorail song, Marge's narration, the truck full of popcorn..." [...] Robert Canning of IGN strongly praised the episode, stating [...] "It is by far one of the most loved episodes of The Simpsons and can safely be called a classic by any fan. From beginning to end, there's joke after joke after hilarious joke. There's nothing in this half-hour that doesn't work, and {{no matter how many times}} I watch this episode, it never, ever gets old." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of Slant Magazine named it the show's best episode, stating [...] "It's the one you think of <b>when</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> of a Simpsons episode", and is [...] "maybe the show's funniest, and it most perfectly encapsulates what may be the show's overriding theme: People are really stupid and self-serving, but if you give them long enough, they'll eventually bumble toward the right answer." ...|$|E
