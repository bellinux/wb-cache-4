5|$|That day <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> horror, but we {{also saw}} quiet acts of courage. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> this courage in a teacher named Liviu Librescu. With the gunman set to enter his class, this brave {{professor}} blocked the door with his body while his students fled to safety. On the Day of Remembrance, this Holocaust survivor gave his own life so that others may live. And this morning we honor his memory and we take strength from his example.|$|E

5000|$|Two Rabbis were {{discussing}} their problems with squirrels in their synagogue attic. One Rabbi said, [...] "We simply called an exterminator and <b>we</b> never <b>saw</b> the squirrels again." [...] The other Rabbi said, [...] "We just gave them all a bar mitzvah, and <b>we</b> never <b>saw</b> the squirrels again." ...|$|R

25|$|When k = n or n1 <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> in the {{previous}} section that V'k(Fn) is a principal homogeneous space, and therefore diffeomorphic to the corresponding classical group. These are listed in the table at the right.|$|E
25|$|All this put {{together}} meant <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> an improved time against the R32 of 21 seconds faster around the nurburgring and 23 seconds faster in V spec trim. Still making the R33 the fastest skyline around the nurburgring.|$|E
25|$|June 12.— After we had dined with Mr. Pageatt, {{where we}} had a neat dinner and strawberries, longest that I have seen, {{we went to a}} house called Dole-hoof, where <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> the {{pictures}} made in wax most liveyly...|$|E

60|$|Paddling {{along the}} eastern side of the lake in the still of the morning, <b>we</b> soon <b>saw</b> a few sheldrakes, which the Indian called Shecorways, and some peetweets on the rocky shore. <b>We</b> also <b>saw</b> and heard loons. It was inspiriting to hear the regular dip of the paddles, as if they were our fins or flippers, and to realize that we were at length fairly embarked.|$|R
25|$|Naive {{set theory}} interprets Boolean {{operations}} as acting on subsets {{of a given}} set X. As <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> earlier this behavior exactly parallels the coordinate-wise combinations of bit vectors, with the union of two sets corresponding to the disjunction of two bit vectors and so on.|$|E
25|$|We {{dropped a}} number of Argentinians as they {{approached}} and I had a couple in my sights and made sure they were {{taken out of the}} game. It was initially estimated that we had killed five and injured seventeen, but we only counted the bodies that <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> drop in front of us.|$|E
25|$|Spektor and {{her family}} did not return home to Moscow until July 2012, when she toured through Russia in support of her sixth album, What <b>We</b> <b>Saw</b> from the Cheap Seats. She has stated {{that she used to}} be vegetarian, though stopped this after touring with The Strokes, who {{frequently}} dined on steak. Spektor is a former smoker.|$|E

25|$|When we {{point out}} the need of {{opposing}} Trotskyism we discover a very strange phenomenon, that voices are raised in its defense {{in the ranks of}} certain organizations and among certain circles in certain parties. These voices belong to people who themselves are intoxicated with this counter-revolutionary ideology. The Trotskyists have long been transformed into the agents of Fascism, into the agents of the German Gestapo. <b>We</b> <b>saw</b> this on the ground during the May putsch in Catalonia; <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> this clearly in the disturbances that occurred in various other places. And everybody will realize this when the trial opens against the P.O.U.M. leaders who were caught spying. And we realize that the hand of Fascism is behind every attempt to demoralize our home front, to undermine the authority of the Republic. Therefore it is essential that we wipe out Trotskyism with a firm hand, for Trotskyism is no longer a political option for the working class but an instrument of the counter-revolution.|$|E
25|$|Public Opinion {{about the}} Vietnam War {{continually}} went {{down as the}} war dragged on. As public opinion went down, opposition continued to grow and the public's dislike of the war {{would lead to the}} protests and demonstrations <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> during this period. Public Opinion data can help shed a light on what the public's overall view of the war was.|$|E
25|$|The depot of the company, {{which is}} a newly-erected {{building}} off Arkwright-street, is complete to the detail, the stables being capable of accommodating 50 or 60 horses. The rooms are lofty and well ventilated, and certainly the core of horses which <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> yesterday were well worth of the home which they now realise. A finer set of cattle it is scarcely possible to conceive, and cannot fail to win the admiration of the people.|$|E

25|$|In {{the section}} on distribution, <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> that ringforts in Northwest Ulster were {{extremely}} rare. If {{this was the case}} during the period, the cashel of Aileach would have been quite a sight to behold for the local population and the fact that a ringfort of its magnitude was even built shows the importance of its occupants. Its relative proximity to Derry shows a conscious attempt to remain connected to that ecclesiastical site.|$|E

The chief timber just near us is wild olive and cedar.... The roses and geraniums grow like trees almost and bloom continually. Ferns of all kinds grow wild. All the way from Mombasa to Kijabe, a distance of 1575 miles, <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> banana, coconut and mangoe trees...|$|E
25|$|After self-releasing {{her first}} three records and gaining {{popularity}} in New York City's independent music scenes, particularly the anti-folk scene centered on New York City's East Village, Spektor signed with Sire Records in 2004 and began achieving greater mainstream recognition. After giving her third album a major label re-release, Sire released her fourth album, Begin to Hope, which {{would go on}} to achieve a Gold certification by the RIAA. Her following two albums, Far and What <b>We</b> <b>Saw</b> from the Cheap Seats, each debuted at number 3 on the Billboard 200.|$|E

25|$|Habituation {{is shared}} across species {{and is the}} {{simplest}} form of learning. Here a person’s response to a stimulus weakens when it becomes familiar. For example, with drink driving advertising in New Zealand, a decade ago <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> cars smashing into each other as a scare tactic. The content of these adverts has become less and less shocking the more we {{have been exposed to}} them. We have now become so desensitised to them that a humour approach has to be taken and the latest example is the ‘Legend’ advert.|$|E
25|$|Otherwise, {{suppose we}} have m vectors of n coordinates, with m<n. Then A is an n×m matrix and Λ is a column vector with m entries, {{and we are}} again {{interested}} in AΛ= 0. As <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> previously, this is equivalent {{to a list of}} n equations. Consider the first m rows of A, the first m equations; any solution of the full list of equations must also be true of the reduced list. In fact, if 〈i1,...,i'm〉 is any list of m rows, then the equation must be true for those rows.|$|E
25|$|Price and I {{drove back}} to Panj-kiang to obtain extra food and water.... We had gone only five miles when we {{discovered}} {{that there was no}} more oil for our motor.... Just then the car swung over the summit of a raise, and <b>we</b> <b>saw</b> the white tents and grazing camels of an enormous caravan. Of course, Mongols would have mutton fat and why not use that for oil! The caravan leader assured us that he had fat in plenty and in ten minutes a great pot of it was warming over the fire. We poured it into the motor and proceeded merrily on our way.|$|E
