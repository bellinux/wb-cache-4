25|$|The command {{leads the}} {{execution}} of the Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) exercise series. CARAT is an annual bilateral exercise, now in its 21st year, and is the lifeblood of U.S. navy-to-navy relationships in Southeast Asia. During the 2014 CARAT season alone, DESRON 7 operated with more than 40 U.S. and international ships, embarked 12 U.S. Navy ships, and led bilateral task groups totaling more than 10,000 personnel. Additionally, CARAT included Seabees, Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technicians, medical professionals, diving experts, 50 U.S. and international aircraft, U.S. Marine Corps landing forces, and more than 150 days of interaction as <b>we</b> <b>planned</b> and exercised with our partners and allies.|$|E
500|$|Later, on August 18, AT {{issued a}} {{statement}} saying: [...] "Our customers {{have the option of}} receiving a bill that is detail-free. Also, we have for years encouraged our customers to switch to online billing because it is convenient, secure, and environmentally friendly." [...] Then, on August 22, AT announced via text message to iPhone users that it was removing itemized detail from paper bills. Ezarik responded, [...] "Looks like they may have got the message," [...] in response to AT's action. Company spokeswoman Lauren Garner claimed public reaction was not the reason for the company's switch from detailed to summary billing, saying, [...] "This was something <b>we</b> <b>planned</b> all along." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{awakening}} at 8:31 UTC, {{the crew}} {{set to work}} preparing to release Hubble from the payload bay of Atlantis. Using the shuttle's robotic arm, McArthur grappled Hubble at 10:45 UTC, and lifted {{it out of the}} orbiter's payload bay to prepare for the release. Good and Massimino were standing by ready to perform a spacewalk in the event that something went wrong during the telescope's deployment. After working through the checklist to prepare the telescope for release, managers on the ground gave the go to Altman to release Hubble, and at 12:57 UTC, McArthur successfully released the telescope as the vehicles flew over Africa. Performing a small separation burn, Johnson backed the orbiter away from the telescope, and Altman called down to managers on the ground confirming the deployment of Hubble. Commending the crew, Altman said [...] "And Houston, Hubble has been released, it's safely back on its journey of exploration as we begin steps to conclude ours. Not everything went as <b>we</b> <b>planned,</b> but <b>we</b> <b>planned</b> a way to work around everything and with the whole team pulling together... we've been able to do some incredible things. And now Hubble can continue on its own, exploring the cosmos, and bringing it home to us as we head for home in a few days. Thank you." [...] Hubble's new equipment and upgraded systems would be tested for several months prior to resuming operation, but if all tests are successful, operation of the telescope would resume in early September.|$|E

500|$|Prior to the film's 2008 release, Hayden Christensen {{reflected}} {{on the possibility of}} one or more sequels: [...] "This has definitely been set up {{in a way that will}} allow for more films, and Doug has been careful to make sure that he's created characters that will have room to grow." [...] Lucas Foster during production of the film stated in an interview: [...] "The ideas got so large, that they really couldn't fit into, you know, one or two movies, they needed to evolve over at least three movies. So <b>we</b> <b>planned</b> the story out over three movies and then we sliced it up in such a way as to leave room for the other two movies." ...|$|E
500|$|During this period, University of Texas {{students}} attempted several stunts, {{trying to}} light the stack early, but to no avail. In both 1933 and 1948, students from UT rented an airplane and tried to drop fire bombs onto the stack. In one of these instances, the plane ran low on fuel, {{and was forced to}} land at Easterwood Airport in College Station—the wooden portions of the plane found themselves part of Bonfire that year. In 1956, there was an unsuccessful attempt to plant explosives at the Bonfire site, and, in the late 1970s, a College Station police officer was fired after trying to ignite the bonfire several days ahead of schedule. Students spotted the officer before he could succeed and chased him across campus. In 1999, a Longhorn fan hired someone to build a six-foot model airplane designed to carry a bomb into the wood stack to ignite it prematurely. [...] "He was actually in the process of building that plane when they had the tragedy at bonfire", Mel Stekoll said. [...] "At that point, we scrapped the plan. It would have been the next year that <b>we</b> <b>planned</b> to try it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 26, 1992, The Times quoted Soros as saying: [...] "Our total {{position}} by Black Wednesday {{had to be}} worth almost $10billion. <b>We</b> <b>planned</b> to sell more than that. In fact, when Norman Lamont said just before the devaluation that he would borrow nearly $15billion to defend sterling, we were amused because that was about how much we wanted to sell." ...|$|E

Also, <b>we</b> <b>plan</b> to elaborate further on the notion of community “smells” perhaps starting from analysing literature in software engineering (e.g., studying software failure stories).

On the other hand, <b>we</b> also <b>plan</b> to add some more advanced management functions {{with the help of}} model techniques to ease management tasks of Cloud.|$|R
2500|$|Around 1928, Tudor was {{in contact}} with the young {{religious}} scholar Mircea Eliade, who was becoming an exponent of experimental neo-traditionalism in Romanian philosophy. Both were influenced by Nae Ionescu, the theologian and logician, theorist of an eclectic ideology known as Trăirism. Looking back on that period in his 1980s memoirs, Eliade wrote: [...] "I met often with Stelian Mateescu, Paul Sterian, Mircea Vulcănescu, and Sandu Tudor. Together <b>we</b> <b>planned</b> a journal of religious philosophy, for which Tudor had found a title: Duh și Slovă (Spirit and Letter)." [...] The magazine, described by Eliade as a would-be successor of Ionescu's mystical journal Logos, never saw print.|$|E
2500|$|The couple {{separated}} in March 2011 with Gauci announcing in June, [...] "I married Hamish {{and he was}} really supportive and encouraging. He gave me confidence and courage to pursue what I wanted, and not what others wanted ... We had a strong and passionate relationship. Very intense. It didn't work out the way <b>we</b> <b>planned</b> ... Hamish and I have separated and decided not to get back together". Gauci's jazz album, Ha Ha Ha (July 2012), deals with the relationship, Sunday Herald Suns Nui Te Koha reported that it would [...] "detail Gauci's personal and professional highs and lows, including a split from her husband of two years". During the marriage (2009–11) she used the name Natalie Cowan.|$|E

Roz retells the urban legend version of Vélez's suicide, {{reminding}} Frasier that [...] "even though things might not happen like <b>we</b> <b>planned,</b> they can work out anyway." [...] When Frasier asks [...] "how it worked out for Lupe", Roz tells him [...] "all she wanted was to be remembered. Will you ever forget that story?"

2500|$|On March 8, 1985, a truck bomb {{blew up in}} Beirut killing {{more than}} 80 people and {{injuring}} more than two hundred. The bomb detonated near the apartment block of Sheikh Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, a Shia cleric thought {{by many to be}} the spiritual leader of Hezbollah. Although the U.S. did not engage in any direct military retaliation to the attack on the Beirut barracks, the 1985 bombing was widely believed by Fadlallah and his supporters to be the work of the United States; Sheikh Fadlallah stating that [...] "'They sent me a letter and I got the message,' and an enormous sign on the remains of one bombed building read: 'Made in the U.S.A.'" [...] Robert Fisk also claims that CIA operatives planted the bomb and that evidence of this is found in an article in The Washington Post newspaper. Journalist Robin Wright quotes articles in The Washington Post and The New York Times as saying that according to the CIA the [...] "Lebanese intelligence personnel and other foreigners had been undergoing CIA training" [...] but that [...] "this was not our [...] operation and it was nothing <b>we</b> <b>planned</b> or knew about." [...] "Alarmed U.S. officials subsequently canceled the covert training operation" [...] in Lebanon, according to Wright.|$|E
