This was a good beginning, but troubles set in almost directly. Three brothers, of the family of Carrera, set to work to turn the popular movement to their own benefit, and by their intrigues overthrew the National Congress, and established a new government with the elder of them as its head.

40|$|Tuvalu is a Pacific atoll {{nation-state}} {{that has}} come to stand for predicaments implicating climate change, forced emigration and resettlement, and loss of territory and sovereignty. Legal and policy remedies seek to address such challenges by radically reframing how sovereignty is conceived. Drawing on literary and legal theory, we seek to extend such work in the terms of cultural geography and anthropology by considering how the archipelago and cultural practices known as fenua could be deployed as symbolic and material resources emphasizing mobility and connection, in contrast to normative ideas of <b>sovereignty,</b> <b>whose</b> orientation to territory imperils atoll states. Our fundamental argument is that legal and policy reforms addressing climate change emigration must be enriched by accounting for the emotional geographies that attend the changing real and conceptual borders of sovereignty and by creating alternative spaces of hope and action...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the political career of Marie de Guise in Scotland {{during the period}} 1548 - 1560. Challenging the conventional interpretation of Guise as the defender of Catholicism whose régime climaxed with the Reformation Rebellion, this study shows that she was, on the contrary, a shrewd and effective politique, whose own dynastic interests and those of her daughter took precedence over her personal and religious convictions. Dynasticism, not Catholicism, was the prime motivational force behind her policy and it is from this perspective that her regime is considered. The eight chapters of the thesis focus on two main themes. Firstly, that Marie de Guise's dynasticism, and political career as a whole, were inextricably associated with those of Mary, Queen of Scots, <b>whose</b> Scottish <b>sovereignty,</b> Catholic claim to the English throne and betrothal to the Dauphin of France carried with it notions of Franco- British Imperialism. And secondly, that Marie de Guise's policy in Scotland was dictated by European dynastic politics and, specifically, by the Franco-Scottish alliance of 1548 - 1560. Significantly more than a betrothal contract, the treaty of Haddington established a 'protectoral' relationship between the 'auld allies' whereby Henri II was able to assume control over Scottish military affairs, diplomacy and foreign policy as the 'protector' of Scotland. Guise's assumption of the regency in 1554 completed the process of establishing French power in Scotland, which was later consolidated, albeit briefly, by the marriage of Mary Stewart to François Valois in 1558. The overall success of Guise's dynastic and domestic policies, however, was limited. International considerations undermined her policies and weakened her administration. Yet the collapse of her regime came not with {{the outbreak of the}} Reformation Rebellion or her alleged defeat {{at the hands of the}} Congregation. Only with her death, did Marie de Guise's regime and French power in Scotland truly collapse...|$|R

5000|$|For {{what many}} {{commentators}} agree {{appears to be}} the first time, the Malays became politically conscious, organising rallies and marches to protest the Malayan Union's formation. At one such gathering, placards were hoisted, declaring that [...] "Malaya Belongs to the Malays. We do not want the other races to be given the rights and privileges of the Malays." [...] The Pan-Malayan Malay Congress of Malay leaders sent a telegram to the British government protesting the Malayan Union's formation, and elaborated on this by asserting that the citizenship provisions constituted a threat to the future of Malaya, eventually leading to [...] "the wiping from existence of the Malay race along with their land and Rulers". A group of Malay royalists and civil servants formed the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) to protest the Malayan Union's formation. Led by Dato' Onn Ja'afar, UMNO organised a campaign and co-ordinated several previously divided Malay organisations against the Union's creation. Although the Union was established as planned, the campaign continued; in 1948, the British retired the Malayan Union in favour of the Federation of Malaya, <b>whose</b> constitution restored <b>sovereignty</b> to the Malay rulers, tightened immigration and citizenship restrictions, and gave the Malays special privileges. Nevertheless, the avowed goal of the British remained the same as it had been in 1946: to introduce [...] "a form of common citizenship open to all those, irrespective of race, who regarded Malaya as their real home and as the object of their loyalty." ...|$|R
40|$|Since the {{overthrow}} and subsequent annexation of the Kingdom of Hawaii {{in the late}} 1800 ’s, {{there has been a}} movement, both subtle and direct, to regain sovereignty for the native Hawaiian people. In the early 1970 ’s, this movement, as a result of continued political abuse and dispossession suffered by native Hawaiians, groups of both native and non-native Hawaiians began rallying together to protect their lands, waters, and rights. A fight for lands and waters slowly transformed into a fight for independence and self-government, for reparations and for sovereignty. This is where the native Hawaiian sovereignty movement was born. However, the movement and those who participate in it have evolved over the last 30 years into more than 300 factions, with each faction representing a different idea of just what exactly the people of Hawaii want and need. These ideas are many and varied, including complete independence from the United States, federal recognition and indigenous status, more control over native Hawaiian assets such as crown and ceded lands, and many others. Only by exploring the organizations formed by these different factions can one begin to understand the purpose of the native Hawaiian sovereignty movement, and the politics and history that its participants and theories are so embedded in. By critically analyzing and critiquing three specific organizations, <b>whose</b> ideas on <b>sovereignty</b> differ widely, there is the hope of knowing if there is any possibility of a movement for sovereignty succeeding against such a dominant colonial power, like the United States, even when that movement seems unable to unite under a common goal. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} the current preoccupations, in the United States and in the United Nations, with the wars on {{terrorism}} and the occupation in Iraq, humanitarian intervention remains an important policy option. Future debates and action are framed by the International Commission on Intervention and State <b>Sovereignty,</b> <b>whose</b> report entitled The Responsibility To Protect and an accompanying research volume were published in December 2001. Future humanitarian crises will arise {{in conjunction with the}} need for military force to pro-tect human beings, and so four shortcomings of the report are evident. First, the report is not as forward-looking as the commissioners thought or as many opponents feared. Second, the concerns of the most vehement critics, especially developing countries, are misplaced because the problem is too little humanitarian intervention, not too much. Third, the purported danger that the concept of the responsi-bility to protect might become a Trojan Horse to be used by the great powers to intervene is fundamentally incorrect; rather, intervention by the USA in its pre-emptive or preventive war mode is the pressing concern. Fourth, the notion of reforming the UN Security Council is an illusion; the real challenge is to identify those humanitarian crises where Washington’s tactical multilateralism kicks in.
