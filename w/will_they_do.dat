They dared call this Augias pigsty American Park! Really, we were better and more properly housed by our Prussian enemies! Poor mothers, what <b>will</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> with your children? Those among you who miraculously came back from that ghastly mêlée more or less wounded or sick were treated here worse than dogs or pigs".

5000|$|The Etruscans {{accepted}} the inscrutability of their gods' <b>wills.</b> <b>They</b> <b>did</b> {{not attempt to}} rationalize or explain divine actions or formulate any doctrines of the gods' intentions.
