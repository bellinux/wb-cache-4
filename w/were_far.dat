5|$|Begun in 1939, plans <b>were</b> <b>far</b> enough {{along that}} tests were {{conducted}} with the main armament and against the underwater protection. Even though the ships were approved for construction under a 1942 fleet replenishment program, the prioritizing of aircraft carriers and smaller ships due to the war, followed by Japan's defeat, killed any chance of the B-65's construction.|$|E
5|$|During the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms {{period of}} China (907–960), while the {{fractured}} political realm of China saw no threat in a Tibet {{which was in}} just as much political disarray, there was {{little in the way}} of Sino-Tibetan relations. Few documents involving Sino-Tibetan contacts survive from the Song dynasty (960–1279). The Song <b>were</b> <b>far</b> more concerned with countering northern enemy states of the Khitan-ruled Liao dynasty (907–1125) and Jurchen-ruled Jin dynasty (1115–1234).|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, the French dangerously underestimated Austrian {{tenacity}} {{and military}} skill. The white coats, as the French called the Austrians, <b>were</b> <b>far</b> better soldiers than the French assumed, and despite such demonstrations as that at Ostrach, Stockach and Winterthur, the French {{continued to hold}} this prejudice. This did not change until 1809 when the Battle of Aspern-Essling and the Battle of Wagram {{a few weeks later}} caused Napoleon to revise his opinion of the Austrian military.|$|E

5|$|In 1942 Coastal Command's {{problems}} did not abate. Experienced {{crews were}} siphoned off to Malta, to undertake ASO against German and Italian shipping in the Mediterranean. Hudson, Blenheim and Beaufighter squadrons had shortfalls of 69, 28 and 20 aircrews by January 1942. The leftover crews, some 75 percent, <b>were</b> <b>far</b> off the 200 operational hours {{considered for a}} pilot to be experienced. Efficiency fell among squadrons.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, Army leaders {{including}} General Eric Shinseki began shifting the Army force toward brigade centered operations. All separate brigades had been inactivated in the 1990s {{as part of}} the U.S. Army's drawdown following the end of the Cold War. These inactivations, along with subsequent reorganization of U.S. Army divisions, saw several divisional brigades stationed in bases that <b>were</b> <b>far</b> from the division's headquarters and support units. These brigades had difficulty operating without support from higher headquarters.|$|E
