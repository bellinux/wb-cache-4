25|$|The 1927 Wood Royal Commission was {{tasked with}} {{investigating}} {{the disappearance of}} Tommy, one of the patrols trackers and a key witness, who had vanished after meeting with Leopold Overheu and the investigation of three particular sites (Gotegotemerrie, Mowerie and Dala) {{in the vicinity of}} the Forrest River Mission (now Oombulgurii) where it was alleged the massacres had taken place.

25|$|Additionally, Professor Frank Perri {{has argued}} that police {{interviews}} with Christopher Porco were seriously flawed because police questioning procedures seemingly failed to account for Porco's probable psychopathy. Psychopaths have unusual emotional responses and feel no remorse for their misdeeds, so standard police interview tactics are useless, as in the Porco case, <b>where</b> <b>police</b> failed to obtain any valuable information during questioning. According to Perri, police should study the Porco case to more productively interview potentially psychopathic suspects by using a non-confrontational approach rather than appealing to emotions.|$|E

The Turkish militia and police that coordinated the attacks refrained from protecting the lives and properties of the victims. Their function was instead to preserve adjacent Turkish properties. However, there were a few cases <b>where</b> <b>police</b> officers prevented criminal activity.
