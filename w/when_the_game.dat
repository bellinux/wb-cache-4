The game {{was scheduled to be}} released on 18 May 2010 in North America, and on 21 May in Europe. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> went gold on 7 April 2010, the European release date was moved up a week. Therefore, the game was released in Europe first, on 14 May 2010, and then in North America on 18 May, as originally scheduled. On 23 November 2010, Alan Wake was released on the Games on Demand service of Xbox Live. On 16 February 2012, a version of the game for Microsoft Windows was released.|$|E

5|$|Blacklist {{graphics}} {{and lack of}} difficulty were criticized. McCaffrey found the visuals unimpressive and most character models to be ugly; he also noted technical problems, such as screen-tearing and frame rate issues. Bloodworth criticized the game's invisible wall and unresponsive controls in certain segments, although he thought those minor issues did not drag down its overall experience. McCaffrey noted that even <b>when</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> is played in perfectionist mode, it is less challenging than its predecessors. He thought Blacklist gave players too many rewards, making its universal-economy system a useless feature. Bloodworth was puzzled by the game's unlock system, which he said hindered its credibility.|$|E

Other major professional sports leagues in North America, the NCAA, and even the International Olympic Committee also shared the same rule in regards to their own respective TV contracts.

40|$|We {{consider}} <b>the</b> {{question of}} <b>when</b> two games are equivalent and the computational complexity of deciding such a property for strategic games. We introduce {{three types of}} isomorphisms depending on which structure of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> is preserved: {it strict}, {it weak}, and {it local}. We show that the computational complexity of <b>the</b> <b>game</b> isomorphism problem depends {{on the level of}} succinctness of the description of <b>the</b> input <b>games</b> but it is independent of the way the isomorphism is defined. Utilities or preferences in games can be represented by Turing machines (general form) or tables (explicit form). <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>games</b> are given in general form, we show that <b>the</b> <b>game</b> isomorphism problem is equivalent to the circuit isomorphism problem. <b>When</b> <b>the</b> <b>games</b> are given in explicit form, we show that <b>the</b> <b>game</b> isomorphism problem is equivalent to the graph isomorphism problem.
