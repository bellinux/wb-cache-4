In this paper, we report how three-dimentional cutting force and surface finish vary with the effects of feed, depth of cut, side rake angle, side cutting edge angle and cutting speed. As the methods of our experiments, we adopted the Hthree dimentional cutting" and then we measured the cutting force P 1, P 2 　and P 3, with　 3 -cmponent tool dynamometer, using the wire resistance strain gauge, and observed the surface finish with KOSAKA TYPE SD- 5.

40|$|The {{power demand}} of many mobile <b>working</b> <b>machines</b> such as mine loaders, {{straddle}} carriers and harvesters varies significantly during operation, and typically, the average power demand of a <b>working</b> <b>machine</b> is considerably {{lower than the}} demand for maximum power. Consequently, {{for most of the}} time, the diesel engine of a <b>working</b> <b>machine</b> operates at a poor efficiency far from its optimum efficiency range. However, the energy efficiency of dieseldriven <b>working</b> <b>machines</b> can be improved by electric hybridization. This way, the diesel engine can be dimensioned to operate within its optimum efficiency range, and the electric drive with its energy storages responds to changes in machine loading. A hybrid <b>working</b> <b>machine</b> can be implemented in many ways either as a parallel hybrid, a series hybrid or a combination of these two. The energy efficiency of hybrid <b>working</b> <b>machines</b> can be further enhanced by energy recovery and reuse. This doctoral thesis introduces the component models required in the simulation model of a <b>working</b> <b>machine.</b> Component efficiency maps are applied to the modelling; the efficiency maps for electrical machines are determined analytically in the whole torque–rotational speed plane based on the electricalmachine parameters. Furthermore, the thesis provides simulation models for parallel, series and parallel-series hybrid <b>working</b> <b>machines.</b> With these simulation models, the energy consumption of the <b>working</b> <b>machine</b> can be analysed. In addition, the hybridization process is introduced and described. The thesis provides a case example of the hybridization and dimensioning process of a <b>working</b> <b>machine,</b> starting from the work cycle of the machine. The selection and dimensioning of the hybrid system {{have a significant impact on}} the energy consumption of a hybrid <b>working</b> <b>machine.</b> The thesis compares the energy consumption of a <b>working</b> <b>machine</b> implemented by three different hybrid systems (parallel, series and parallel-series) and with different component dimensions. The payback time of a hybrid <b>working</b> <b>machine</b> and the energy storage lifetime are also estimated in the study...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose {{optimization}} of costing method for planning a production-sales programme of the chosen engineering enterprise dealing with the production of components for <b>wood</b> <b>working</b> <b>machines.</b> This engineering company uses the calculation pattern methodology in the comprehensive cost accounting system. All costs components are absorbed by individual outputs in this cost calculation. The results of this calculation are not available for decision-making tasks. In order to solve the decision tasks relating to output assortment optimization, it is necessary to show separately variable costs influenced by changes in production volume and fixed costs not influenced by changes in production volume. For these reasons we propose a specific application of retrograde costing as a necessary condition for effective system of decision-making on the basis of contribution margin calculation. The contribution margin/standard hour is the criteria for the calculation in a critical place of production and this is very important information for developing an optimal production-sales programme...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{works have}} been {{performed}} by many researchers 1) ∼ 8) {{on the effects of}} cutting velocity on the process of wood machining, and it is known that these results differ from each other according to the kind of <b>wood</b> <b>working</b> <b>machines</b> used in the experiments. For instance, some results show practically no effect on cutting force 2), 6), whereas others show a curve with a minimum value of cutting force at some velocities, or a gradual decrease with an increase in cutting velocity 1), 4), 7), 8). Furthermore, there exist many unknown matters with respect to the effects of cutting velocity on mechanism of chip formation in wood cutting. In the present experiment, cutting tests of wood with the grain were performed to obtain fundamental data on the effects of cutting velocity on chip formation, cutting force and frictional coefficient by the use an experimental appearatus for cutting tests (Fig. 1). The range of cutting velocity employed in these tests were from 0. 0023 to 52. 53 m/sec. The depth of cut (feed of tool perrevolution of a steel disk) was adjusted from 0. 3 to 0. 7 mm by varing the speed of the feed carriage in combination with two variable speed motors and somepulleys (Fig. 1). The tool used for cutting test was made of high-speed steel (SKH 2), and its sharpness angle was 25 degrees; its clearance angle was held constant at 10 degrees. Test materials used were mainly Hinki (Chamaecyparisobtusa, specific gravity in air-dry (ru) : 0. 40, moisture content (u) : 13. 0 %), Western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla, ru: 0. 38, u : 14. 3 %) and Red meranti(Shorea sp, ru : 0. 38, u: 13. 0 %); in addition to these, hinoki in water-saturated condition (u : 83 ± 5 %) was used. The main results obtained are summarized as follows : (1) Three types of chip formation were recognized throughout the entire cutting conditions employed in this test, that is,their types are continuous flow type, split type, and intermediate type (resembling continuous flow type but the chip has slight checks). Relations of these types to cutting velocity (V) at various combinations of depth of cut (t) and workpiece conditions are given in Fig. 6. (2) The curvature of the chip (o) and the checks occurring in the chip, change with V, for instance, o decreases and the pith of checks (pc) in the chip increases, with increases in V (Figs. 7 and 8). (3) Although the cutting-force components change remarkably with V, the degree of their changes depends not only on the cutting conditions but also on the workpiece conditions. For instance, in the range of very-low cutting-velocity, below about 10 m/sec, the horizontal component (FH) and the frictional force (F) of the cutting force, when cutting with air-dried workpieces, decrease remarkably with increases in V. In the range of V of about 10 ～ 30 m/sec, their components are not affected by V. In the range of V of about 30 ～ 53 m/sec, their components decreae gradually with increases in V. Compared with these, the vertical component (Fv) and the normal force (N) of the cutting force change slightly or vary little with V (Figs. 9 and 10). (4) The remarkable increase in V and the presence of a large quantity of free water reduce the friction on the interface between the tool rake face and the chip to much lower value. For instance, the frictional coefficient (μ), when cutting with water-saturated workpieces, is lower in comparison with that when cutting with air-dried workpieces, and μ, when cutting not only with water-saturated workpiecesbut also with air-dried workpieces decreases with increases in V (Fig. 12). These results can be explained {{on the basis of the}} frictional theories on theories on terms of adhesion and lubrication and so on...|$|E

40|$|Recently, the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and Culture {{published}} {{the view of}} Japanese education in the 21 st century, which was deliberated by the Central Council for Education. In this educational program, the environment education was further promoted at the schools. So, we {{paid attention to the}} importance of the enviromllent education at the schools. The awareness about the environment education of teachers at the junior high school was investigated. The results were summed up as the following six points. 1) Teachers took interest in the environment education, and most of them practically developed the environment education in the industnal arts and homemaking class. 2) <b>Wood</b> <b>working</b> area, which should be studied by all students, showed the highest development rate for the environment education among the six studying areas: <b>wood</b> <b>working,</b> metal <b>working,</b> electricity, <b>machine,</b> cultivation, and information basis. 3) The environment problems that were taught in the industrial arts and homemakmg class were Tropical tree-felling, Reusing wood and Utilizing thinned wood, Recycle, Saving energy and Saving resources in order of the answer number to questionnaire. 4) The environment problems that were closely related to technology education were Recycle, Reusing wood and Utilizing thinned wood, Tropical tree-felling, Saving energy and Saving resources in order of the answer number to questionnaire. 5) The reasons that the environment education was not developed in the industrial arts and homemaking class were for no time of teaching, no teaching materials and tools, and so on. 6) The teaching materials that were necessary to teach the environment education were Data collections and Video tape recorders. In this paper, it was concluded that many industrial arts teachers took interest in the environment education and they wanted to obtain the teaching materials and tools on the environment education, and studying the environment problems was most effective for students in <b>wood</b> <b>working</b> area because many of the items in connection with wood were utilized in the industrial arts and homemakmg class...|$|R
