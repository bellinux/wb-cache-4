5|$|Despite {{the switch}} to 3D, the game is still played {{primarily}} from an overhead perspective similar to the original 2D Metal Gear games. However, the camera angle will change during certain situations, such as a corner view when Snake flattens himself to a <b>wall</b> <b>next</b> to an open space, or into first-person when crawling under tight spaces or using certain items such as the binoculars or a sniper rifle. The player can also use the first-person view while remaining idle to look around Snake's surroundings or see what's ahead of him.|$|E
5|$|Tammi {{returns from}} the bank and gets back in her car. Dwight surprises her {{from the back seat}} and puts a gun to her head, and tells her to drive. Dwight comes to the {{conclusion}} that Randall killed Chase because he and Tammi were together. Dwight hands Randall a gun and tells him to shoot Tammi. Tammi tries to talk Randall out of it but Randall shoots through the <b>wall</b> <b>next</b> to her and kills Dwight. Randall is eventually arrested, but Tammi successfully manages to run away.|$|E
5|$|The {{entirety}} of the church's interior {{is covered with}} 14th-century frescoes, which are described as “particularly remarkable” in a UNESCO publication. Among the notable mural portraits is that of church patron Saint Peter, whose larger-than-life image adorns the <b>wall</b> <b>next</b> to the iconostasis. Other frescoes include that of Jesus Christ painted {{to the right of}} the apse and that of Saint Alexius next to the entrance. The middle reaches of the walls feature images from the Holy Week, with frescoes depicting events from other major holidays above them. The conch of the apse boasts an image of the Mother of God; portraits of various saints and scenes from the Ascension of Jesus and the Annunciation complete the decoration of the apse.|$|E

5|$|The {{freighter}} {{features a}} large, upward-opening main deck cargo door on its forward port-side fuselage. Adjacent to this large cargo door is an exit door {{used by the}} pilots. All other emergency exits are omitted, and cabin windows and passenger amenities are not available. The main deck cargo hold has a smooth fiberglass lining, and a fixed rigid barrier with a sliding access door serves as a restraint <b>wall</b> <b>next</b> to the flight deck. Both lower holds can be equipped with a telescoping baggage system to load custom-fitted cargo modules. When equipped for extended-range transatlantic operations, UPS's 757-200PFs feature an upgraded auxiliary power unit, additional cargo bay fire suppression equipment, enhanced avionics, and an optional supplemental fuel tank in the aft lower hold. Total production for the 757-200PF totaled 80 aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Fraternity's rituals {{at their}} Bayswater temple {{were carried out}} under a dim light, with Fortune {{claiming}} that bright light disperses etheric forces. An altar {{was placed in the}} centre of a room, with the colours of the altar-cloth and the symbols on the altar varying according to the ceremony being performed. A light was placed on the altar while incense, usually frankincense, was burned. The senior officers sat in a row along the eastern end of the room, while officers—who were believed to be channels for cosmic forces—were positioned at various positions on the floor. The lodge was opened by walking around the room in a circle chanting, with the intent of building a psychic force up as a <b>wall.</b> <b>Next,</b> the cosmic entities would be invoked, with the members believing that these entities would manifest in astral form and interact with the chosen officers.|$|E

25|$|The {{east room}} is {{the larger of}} the two {{southern}} rooms. It has a plainer fireplace with a shallow firebox in its west <b>wall.</b> <b>Next</b> to it is an original cupboard, with hand-planed wide-board doors hung on HL wrought iron hinges. A door on the east opens into a small room, currently used as a bathroom, in the front frame addition. In the smaller room to the west, the beams were not shaved down.|$|E
25|$|On {{the south}} <b>wall,</b> <b>next</b> to the transept, is a still-impressive processional entrance. The door pillars are surmounted by a {{segmental}} arch, and above that a round arch of three orders, {{the area between}} forming a tympanum. The entire exterior of the doorway is carved in a detailed zig-zag pattern, which was probably used widely around the building. Beyond this lay the cloister, from which the canons would enter the church in procession.|$|E

50|$|El Arco de la Rosa ("Rose Arch") is a gate {{carved into}} the medieval <b>walls</b> <b>next</b> to the cathedral. It is named after captain Gaspar de la Rosa, {{who lived in the}} city during the 18th century. The gate was renovated in 1973.|$|R
50|$|In the 2007 film Superbad, Evan {{is playing}} a video game in his bedroom while his friend Seth stands in the doorway. During this scene's lively exchange, two {{different}} posters for The Goon are clearly visible hanging on the <b>walls</b> <b>next</b> to each actor.|$|R
25|$|A 220m long 'Living Wall' was {{unveiled}} at Two Snowhill {{to coincide with}} the launch of the building. The wall, which reaches up to seven metres high, incorporates 604 sq m of planting interspersed with decorative aluminium panels which have been designed to capture artificial and natural daylight. It is the largest of its kind in Europe. Work began on the wall in early 2012 with the construction of a steel frame along the Metro viaduct <b>wall</b> <b>next</b> to Snowhill Station.|$|E
25|$|Modern window {{units with}} IG {{typically}} completely replace the older double-hung unit, and include other improvements such as better sealing between {{the upper and}} lower windows, and spring-operated weight balancing that removes the need for large hanging weights inside the <b>wall</b> <b>next</b> to the windows, allowing for more insulation around the window and reducing air leakage, provides robust protection against the sun and will keep the house cool in the hot summer and warm in winter. These spring-operated balancing mechanisms also typically permit the top of the windows to swing inward, permitting cleaning of the exterior of the IG window from inside the building.|$|E
25|$|The {{memorial}} of {{the victims}} of World War II with the names of victims is situated in a new park. The tables on deportation in 1947 are on the statue of Mother and Child in the park of the Health Center. On the <b>wall</b> <b>next</b> to the entrance gate to the former cemetery there is a diploma by the sculptor Klára Pataki. The statue of a girl with a bucket situated {{in the area of the}} Slovak Primary School is the work of the sculptor J. V. Huck. The houses made from extruded bricks with a walled gable under the thatched roof date back to 19th century. Several of these houses have been preserved today.|$|E

2500|$|The Society was a {{shareholding}} company. [...] In 1861 it {{purchased a}} 13-hectare (32 acre) {{plot of land}} outside the Hamburg city <b>walls,</b> <b>next</b> to a municipal cemetery.

25|$|Of course, many conjectural {{decisions}} were made, {{such as the}} precise locations of the exterior doors and the size and locations of the windows. On the interior, {{the location of the}} staircase to the loft and the form of the large open hearths and built-in bed box also involved conjecture, but were based on historical precedent. In the original Brooklyn Museum installation, there were two bed boxes on the exterior wall of the north room. When the house was moved to its present location in 2006, it was decided that if the house did have a bed box it more logically was on an interior <b>wall</b> <b>next</b> to the hearth as you now will see it.|$|E
25|$|CaixaForum Madrid is a post-modern {{art gallery}} in {{the centre of}} Madrid. It is {{sponsored}} by the Catalan-Balearic bank La Caixa and located next to the Salón del Prado. Although the CaixaForum is a modern building, it also exhibits retrospectives of artists from earlier time periods and has evolved into one of the most-visited museums in Madrid. It was constructed by the Swiss architects Herzog & de Meuron from 2001 to 2007, who took an unused industrial building and hollowed it out at the base and inside and then added additional floors encased with rusted steel. Next to the gallery is an art installation by French botanist Patrick Blanc of green plants growing {{on the wall of the}} neighbouring house. The red of the top floors with the green of the <b>wall</b> <b>next</b> to it form a contrast. The green is in reflection of the neighbouring Royal Botanical Garden.|$|E
25|$|One of the rioters {{sat in the}} Speaker's chair where Morin {{had been}} sitting {{only a few minutes}} before, and {{declared}} the dissolution of the House. The room was turned upside down while other men entered the room of the Legislative Council. The acts of vandalism that were reported included the destruction of the seats and desks, stamping on the portrait of Louis-Joseph Papineau, that had been hanging on the <b>wall</b> <b>next</b> to that of Queen Victoria. Perry claimed to have set fire to the room himself when he hit the gas chandelier suspended on the ceiling with a brick, aiming for the clock that was directly above the Speaker's chair. The clock, whose ticking apparently got on his nerves, was, according to his account, showing 9:40pm when it happened. Other sources, including newspapers of the time, believed the fire to have been started when rioters outside the building started throwing the torches that some of them had carried from the Champ-de-Mars meeting.|$|E
50|$|Cabinets {{filled with}} archaeological finds from Al Qusais site line the <b>walls</b> <b>next</b> to the {{excavation}} scene.

Most importantly, this type of UDDT is accessible directly from the ground level and does not require access steps or ramps which are common for many UDDT designs.|$|R
500|$|On September 21, 2016, {{the statue}} was vandalized.

It is unclear whether the vandalism {{on the wall and}} statue were both done by the same person.|$|E
500|$|The east gate, [...] wide, still stands; {{although}} what {{is visible}} now is principally medieval and 19th century, the Roman original {{probably did not}} look much different. A postern gate was set into the north <b>wall</b> <b>next</b> to a section that has now collapsed. It was originally constructed {{in the form of}} a narrow curved passageway. Another postern gate may have been set into the collapsed south wall. These suggest that there may have been routes into the fort from across the marshes or access from a harbour, of which no trace remains.|$|E
500|$|Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), in the meantime, invites her {{co-workers}} to her {{art show}} after work. At the show, Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) {{and his partner}} Gil critique her art, with Gil dismissing it as [...] "motel art", not realizing that she is standing right behind them. None of her other co-workers show, leaving her feeling alienated and sad. Roy comes by and compliments her work, but obviously does so as a [...] "boyfriend's gesture" [...] with no sincere appreciation for art. The general attendees show little interest in her drawings, and she begins to doubt her abilities. As she begins to take her work down, Michael arrives, having been delayed by the trip {{back to the office}} to move Ryan's things. He expresses sincere awe for her work and asks to buy her drawing of the office building. Pam embraces him as her eyes tear up. Michael hangs Pam's drawing on the <b>wall</b> <b>next</b> to his office.|$|E
