5|$|The Baltimore Chamber Music Society, {{founded by}} Hugo Weisgall and Rudolph Rothschild in 1950, has {{commissioned}} {{a number of}} renowned works and is known {{for a series of}} controversial concerts featuring mostly 20th-century composers.

5|$|The Cooper–Church Amendment was resurrected {{during the}} winter and {{incorporated}} into the Supplementary Foreign Assistance Act of 1970. This time the measure made it through both houses of Congress and became law on 22 December. As a result, all U.S. ground troops and advisors <b>were</b> <b>barred</b> <b>from</b> participating in military actions in Laos or Cambodia, while the air war being conducted in both countries by the U.S. Air Force was ignored.|$|E
5|$|The {{team has}} also had several {{instances}} of NCAA sanctions on the program that have affected performance and recruiting. In the 1970s, the Gophers were in a violent brawl with the Ohio State Buckeyes and <b>were</b> <b>barred</b> <b>from</b> post-season appearances for two seasons after an incident involving the illegal resale of tickets. Still more severe was the mid-1990s academic scandal under then-coach Clem Haskins {{that resulted in the}} forfeit of a Final Four appearance.|$|E

50|$|The CGT had <b>been</b> <b>barred</b> <b>from</b> {{addressing}} the founding conference of Confederación Interamericana de Trabajadores (forerunner of ORIT), {{due to their}} criticism of U.S. trade union policies.

5|$|Athenian {{girls were}} not {{formally}} educated; instead, their mothers taught them the domestic {{skills necessary for}} running a household. Formal education for boys consisted of rhetoric, necessary for effective political participation, and physical education in preparation for military service. These skills were not considered necessary for women, who <b>were</b> <b>barred</b> <b>from</b> learning them. Classical art indicates that girls and boys played with toys such as spinning tops, hoops, and seesaws, and played games such as piggyback. The gravestone of Plangon, an Athenian girl aged about five {{which is in the}} Glyptothek museum in Munich, shows her holding a doll; a set of knucklebones hangs on a wall in the background.|$|E
5|$|Despite these incidents, {{legislative}} elections planned {{before the}} coup {{were held in}} April 1964. They were originally to be held on 23 February, though he dissolved the National Assembly and rescheduled them for 12 April. Upon insistence of the French, M'ba allowed opposition candidates to run, which it claimed was {{the main reason for}} starting the coup in the first place. However, their leaders <b>were</b> <b>barred</b> <b>from</b> participating because of their involvement in the coup, and known anti-Mba organizers were deported to remote parts of the country. In addition, M'ba was known to have bribed voters with banknotes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the time}} when African Americans <b>were</b> <b>barred</b> <b>from</b> ordination, women began to receive greater {{opportunities}} for leadership. Women formed {{an important part of}} the Assemblies of God's constituency, many being Sunday School workers and evangelists, most prominent being Aimee Semple McPherson (who would later found the Foursquare Church). This made the issue of women's place in the movement important in the 1930s. It was also recognized that many congregations who could not afford male pastors relied on women preachers. Despite the fact that opposition to female pastors had been regularly affirmed since 1914, the office of pastor was opened to women in 1935.|$|E

5|$|Elections {{were held}} in early October from which all {{political}} parties <b>were</b> <b>barred</b> <b>from</b> participating. Castillo Armas was the only candidate; he won the election with 99% of the vote, completing his transition into power. Castillo Armas became affiliated with a party named the Movimiento de Liberación Nacional (MLN), which remained the ruling party of Guatemala from 1954 to 1957. It was led by Mario Sandoval Alarcón, and was a coalition of municipal politicians, bureaucrats, coffee planters, {{and members of the}} military, all of whom were opposed to the reforms of the Guatemalan Revolution. In the congressional elections held under Castillo Armas, it was the only party allowed to run.|$|E
5|$|Garrison {{applied for}} an {{emergency}} security clearance prior to the hearing, as one had been granted to Robb, but no clearance was granted {{during the course of}} the hearing, which meant that Oppenheimer's attorneys had no access to the secrets that Robb was able to see. On at least three occasions, Garrison and his co-counsel <b>were</b> <b>barred</b> <b>from</b> the hearing room for security reasons, leaving Oppenheimer unrepresented, in violation of AEC regulations. During the course of the hearing, Robb repeatedly cross-examined Oppenheimer's witnesses utilizing top-secret documents unavailable to Oppenheimer's lawyers. He often read aloud from those documents, despite their secret status.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to high-profile lawsuits against Chinese officials and corporations, Falun Gong practitioners {{have filed a}} number of complaints and civil suits alleging discrimination outside China, most of them centered within the Chinese diaspora community. Several complaints have been made after Falun Gong groups <b>were</b> <b>barred</b> <b>from</b> participating in parades or events, with mixed results. In Canada and in New York, Falun Gong practitioners won judgments against Chinese businesses or community organizations for discriminating against them {{on the basis of}} their religious creed.|$|E

5|$|On 18 January 1919 the Paris Peace Conference began. The conference {{aimed to}} {{establish}} peace between the war's belligerents {{and to establish}} the post-war world. The Treaty of Versailles resulting from the conference dealt solely with Germany. This treaty, along with the others that were signed during the conference, each took their name from the suburb of Paris where the signings took place. While 70 delegates from 26 nations participated in the Paris negotiations, representatives from Germany <b>were</b> <b>barred</b> <b>from</b> attending, nominally over fears that a German delegation would attempt to play one country off against the other and unfairly influence the proceedings.|$|E
5|$|The growing dispute {{disturbed}} the British government, who {{had extensive}} commercial {{interests in the}} area. Through their minister to Chile, they mediated negotiations between the two countries. These were successfully concluded on 28 May 1902 with three pacts, Pactos de Mayo. The third limited the naval armaments of both countries; both <b>were</b> <b>barred</b> <b>from</b> acquiring any further warships for five years without giving the other an eighteen months' advance notice. The United Kingdom purchased the two Chilean battleships, while Japan took over the order for the two Argentine armored cruisers; the two Argentine battleships were never ordered. Two Argentine cruisers and Chile's Capitán Prat were demilitarized.|$|E
5|$|A {{clash between}} local Torajan {{leaders and the}} South Sulawesi provincial {{government}} (as a tourist developer) broke out in 1985. The government designated 18 Toraja villages and burial sites as traditional tourist attractions. Consequently, zoning restrictions were applied to these areas, such that Torajans themselves <b>were</b> <b>barred</b> <b>from</b> changing their tongkonans and burial sites. The plan was opposed by some Torajan leaders, as they felt that their rituals and traditions were being determined by outsiders. As a result, in 1987, the Torajan village of Kété Kesú and several other designated tourist attractions closed their doors to tourists. This closure lasted only a few days, as the villagers found it too difficult to survive without the income from selling souvenirs.|$|E

5|$|In 1768, {{civil war}} {{broke out in the}} Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, when the Bar Confederation sought to depose King Stanisław August Poniatowski. One of Kościuszko's brothers, Józef, fought {{on the side of the}} insurgents. Faced with a {{difficult}} choice between the rebels and his sponsors—the King and the Czartoryski family, who favored a gradualist approach to shedding Russian domination—Kościuszko chose to leave Poland. In late 1769, he and a colleague, the noted artist Aleksander Orłowski, were granted royal scholarships, and on October 5 they set off for Paris. They wanted to further their military education, but as foreigners they <b>were</b> <b>barred</b> <b>from</b> enrolling in French military academies, and so they enrolled instead in the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. There Kościuszko pursued his interest in drawing and painting and took private lessons in architecture from the noted French architect Jean-Rodolphe Perronet.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, a {{group of}} {{citizens}} from Newport asked Combs for help in cracking down on crime in their city. Just across the Ohio River from Cincinnati, Newport had gained {{a reputation as a}} haven for prostitution, gambling, and illegal alcohol. After receiving an affidavit from the citizens, Combs sent agents from the department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to the city. They cited six bars for violating laws governing liquor sales, and instructed Attorney General John B. Breckinridge to prosecute four local officials for failure to enforce the laws. When allegations of civil rights violations in a related trial surfaced, U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy sent federal Justice Department officials to Newport, prompting the resignation of the sheriff and a circuit judge. Two other local officials <b>were</b> <b>barred</b> <b>from</b> office for four years.|$|E
5|$|Knowing that {{he could}} not fight on without the support of the army, Jacobo Árbenz {{resigned}} on 27 June 1954, handing over power to Colonel Carlos Enrique Diaz. US ambassador John Peurifoy then mediated negotiations held in El Salvador between the army leadership and Castillo Armas which led to Armas being included in the ruling military junta on 7 July 1954, and was named provisional president a few days later. The US recognized the new government on 13 July. Elections were held in early October, from which all political parties <b>were</b> <b>barred</b> <b>from</b> participating, and Castillo Armas was the only candidate, winning the election with 99% of the vote. Among the outcomes of the meeting in El Salvador was a planned new constitution, which would roll back most of the progressive reform brought by the revolution.|$|E
