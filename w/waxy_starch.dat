50|$|<b>Waxy</b> <b>starch</b> is of main {{interest}} because fractionation of normal starch to obtain pure amylose or amylopectin is very costly.|$|E
50|$|The tuber {{is about}} 38% starch. It is a <b>waxy</b> <b>starch</b> that lacks amylose and has {{potential}} uses as a binder and thickener in food processing.|$|E
50|$|Still the {{extensive}} (mushroomed) agro-research {{did not lead}} to any large scale use in the feed industry due to analytical research analysing the pancreatic digestibility of starches of several genotypes. <b>Waxy</b> <b>starch</b> of the genome type ae, as also the genome type du and su2, for starches with a high amylose content, show an excellent digestibility. Thus, amylopectin, waxy starches alone, cannot be correlated to good digestibility. Sandsted suggests that digestibility could lie more in the structure of starch granule, in differences in bonding of the starch molecules and in possible anomalous linkages between the molecules.|$|E
50|$|Some {{cultivated}} plant varieties have pure amylopectin starch without amylose, known as <b>waxy</b> <b>starches.</b> The most used is waxy maize, others are glutinous rice and <b>waxy</b> potato <b>starch.</b> <b>Waxy</b> <b>starches</b> have less retrogradation, {{resulting in a}} more stable paste.

The main objective {{of this study is to}} position the recently discovered spontaneous mutation for amylose-free cassava starch in relation to the other starches with well-known characteristics. Paste clarity, wavelength of maximum absorption (?max), pasting properties, swelling power, solubility, and dispersed volume fraction measurements and gel stability (acid and alkaline resistance, shear, refrigeration, and freeze/thaw stability) were evaluated in the different types and sources of starch included in this study. ?max in the <b>waxy</b> cassava <b>starch</b> was reduced considerably in comparison with that of normal cassava starch (535 vs 592 nm). RVA peak viscosity of <b>waxy</b> cassava <b>starch</b> was larger than in normal cassava starch (1119 vs 937 cP) and assumed a position intermediate between the waxy potato and maize starches. Acid, alkaline, and shear stability of <b>waxy</b> cassava <b>starch</b> were similar to normal cassava except for alkaline pH, at which it showed a low effect.

50|$|Starch from {{waxy maize}} differs from regular maize starch in both {{molecular}} structure and pasting characteristics. Pastes made from <b>waxy</b> <b>starch</b> {{are long and}} cohesive, whereas pastes made from regular maize starch are short and heavy bodied. Waxy maize starch is a major starch component in adhesives used for making bottle labels. This waxy starch-based adhesive imparts resolubilizing resistance to the labels which prevents their soaking off the bottle if immersed in water or being subjected to very high humidity conditions. Moreover, waxy maize starches are commonly used in the US for the manufacture of gummed tapes and envelope adhesives.|$|E
5000|$|Waxy corn (maize) {{was found}} in China in 1909. As this plant showed many {{peculiar}} traits, the American breeders long {{used it as a}} genetic marker to tag the existence of hidden genes in other maize breeding programs. In 1922 a researcher found that the endosperm of waxy maize contained only amylopectin and no amylose starch molecule in opposition to normal dent maize varieties that contain both. Until World War II, the main source of starch in the USA was tapioca but when Japan severed the supply lines of the States, they forced processors to turn to waxy maize. Amylopectin or <b>waxy</b> <b>starch</b> is now used mainly in food products, but also in the textile, adhesive, corrugating and paper industry.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, {{when the}} Japanese severed the supply {{lines of the}} States, {{processors}} were forced to turn to waxy maize. Waxy maize appeared to be especially suitable for this purpose because it could be milled with the same equipment already extensively used for ordinary maize. H. H. Schopmeyer has advised that the production of waxy maize in Iowa for industrial use amounted to approximately 356 metric tons in 1942 and 2540 tons in 1943. In 1944, there were only 5 varieties of waxy maize available for <b>waxy</b> <b>starch</b> production. In 1943, {{to cover all the}} special requirements for amylopectin, approximately 81650 tons of grains were produced. From World War II until 1971, all the waxy maize produced in the U.S. was grown under contract for food or industrial processors. In fact, most of the maize was grown in only a few counties in Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana.|$|E

40|$|Bread staling {{leads to}} {{substantial}} food wastage and hence {{economic and environmental}} burdens in the industrial world. Reduced amylose waxy wheat flour has shown potential as an antistaling additive in bread, although the causal mechanism {{at the molecular level}} is not well defined. The waxy durum under investigation in this study represents a novel substrate due to its breeding history, and has shown a strong antistaling effect in bread. Bread made from waxy durum flour was about half as firm initially and 25 % less firm than conventional bakers’ flour after a week’s storage. The aim {{of this study was to}} comprehensively analyse the physicochemical and functional properties of this waxy durum flour and starch, to provide insights into its antistaling mechanism. The swelling and gelatinisation properties of waxy durum were compared to those of a range of normal and <b>waxy</b> cereal <b>starches.</b> It was found that the <b>waxy</b> durum <b>starch</b> exhibited delayed swelling behaviour relative to other <b>waxy</b> cereal <b>starches,</b> most likely due to its higher relative amylose content. Surfactant treatment was found to eliminate diversity of swelling behaviour in normal, but not <b>waxy</b> <b>starches.</b> This suggested that factors other than starch surface proteins and lipids influence the swelling behaviour of <b>waxy</b> <b>starches.</b> As starch retrogradation was identified in the literature as a key factor in bread staling, flour and starch thermal properties were assessed at different water contents. The relationship between starch retrogradation and water content was also found to be different between the waxy and normal wheat starches studied, with retrogradation of <b>waxy</b> <b>starches</b> favoured by a more concentrated system. <b>Waxy</b> durum <b>starch</b> and flour in isolation were found to exhibit a higher resistance to retrogradation than normal durum, and normal and <b>waxy</b> bread wheat <b>starches.</b> Both <b>waxy</b> flours were found to have a similar crumb softening effect after the first day of bread storage, however only the waxy durum flour produced a significant antistaling effect over longer term storage. It was postulated that the early stage crumb softening effect was related to the impact on rheological behaviour of the dough during the baking process, but that in the longer term the waxy durum reduced amylopectin retrogradation, suggesting that its unique thermal behaviour was the primary factor influencing its antistaling effect with a secondary contribution by minor flour components. The results of this study add to the breadth of current knowledge of the physicochemical and thermal properties of <b>waxy</b> durum <b>starch</b> and flour in particular and <b>waxy</b> <b>starches</b> and flours in general, with particular emphasis on mechanisms of antistaling functionality at the molecular level.

40|$|Physicochemical {{properties}} of starches from eight coix (Coix lachryma- jobi L.) accessions were investigated. There was considerable variation in most measured traits, generally {{corresponding to the}} separation into waxy and normal amylose types. The amylose contents of five normal coix ranged from 15. 9 to 25. 8 %, and those of three waxy coix were 0. 7 - 1. 1 %. Swelling power of <b>waxy</b> coix <b>starches</b> varied between 28. 6 and 41. 0 g/g, generally higher than waxy maize.

40|$|This work {{demonstrates}} how the multi-scale structure of starch granules changes during acid hydrolysis. The degradation mechanism {{has also been}} discussed. Both the whole native Gelose 80 (G 80) starch in its granule form and the enzyme debranched G 80 starch degraded apparently until a stable size was reached. In contrast, no degradation of the debranched <b>waxy</b> <b>starch</b> was observed from size exclusion chromatography (SEC) results. This indicated that amylose and amylopectin were hydrolyzed through cleavage of α-(1  →  4) and α-(1  →  6) linkages, respectively. From X-ray diffraction (XRD), the relative crystallinity was increased with increased acid treatment days. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) {{results showed that the}} lamellar peak intensity and crystalline thickness (d) from 1 D correlation function for G 80 were increased during acid hydrolysis. However, the lamellar structure of <b>waxy</b> <b>starch</b> disappeared quickly. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), two different acid hydrolysis patterns were observed at the starch granule level including the endo-corrosion pattern in <b>waxy</b> <b>starch</b> and the exo-corrosion pattern in G 80. Those differences would lead to the quick degradation of the lamellar structure of <b>waxy</b> <b>starch</b> and contributed to the gradual crystallinity increase for G 80 starch. Thermal degradation behavior from thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results showed that the thermal decomposition temperature of acid-hydrolyzed starch was shifted to low temperature, which confirmed the molecular weight degradation during acid hydrolysis.

Curdlan could effectively en-hance the freezing resistance, and <b>waxy</b> corn <b>starch,</b> on the meanwhile, could improve the water holding capacity. A smooth and soft texture might be remained after frozen storage, and freeze-dried soft tofu with good qualities could also be obtained by using curdlan and <b>waxy</b> corn <b>starch.</b> Freezing resistance and water holding capacity was affected sig-nificantly by concentrations of both curdlan and <b>waxy</b> corn <b>starch</b> applied.

40|$|Graduation date: 2008 Page 29 {{intentionally}} left blankPage 29 left intentionally blankThis {{research was}} undertaken to provide barley growers, processors, and consumers with quality food barley. Because all currently available varieties of food barley are of spring growth habit, {{the first phase}} of the research involved agronomic assessment of these varieties under Oregon conditions. Because winter barley usually yields more than spring barley in these environments, the second phase of this research involved development of winter habit food barley germplasm. Grain β-glucan content is the most important attribute for food barley varieties. This trait is important because of the cholesterol-reducing properties of β-glucan. Thirty three cultivars and advanced lines reported to vary in β-glucan content were grown in 2006 and 2007 at two locations in northeastern Oregon under dryland cropping conditions. Seed yield, test weight, percentage of plump kernels, grain β-glucan and grain protein were measured on replicated samples from the four environments. Hulled, <b>waxy</b> <b>starch</b> varieties appear to have the greatest agronomic potential for dryland production as they combine high yield potential and grain β-glucan percentage. Marker assisted selection was used to rapidly develop barley germplasm with novel combinations of alleles at loci controlling starch synthesis and growth habit. The target loci were WAX, VRN-H 1, and VRN-H 2. The goal was to develop <b>waxy</b> <b>starch,</b> high grain β-glucan, and winter habit germplasm. Pre-screening of candidate parental lines identified combinations with target vrn-H 1 (winter) alleles. This allowed for immediate fixation of favorable alleles at this locus. VRN-H 1 is coincident with a major low temperature tolerance QTL (Fr 1). Perfect markers were based on functional domains in GBSSI and ZCCT-H, the genes determining wax and VRN-H 2. Because spring growth habit at VRN-H 2 is due to gene deletion, codominant alleles at a tightly linked locus (HvSNF 2), were also used. Backcross-derived germplasm was genotyped in two stages. Homozygotes at the two loci were identified in one-step screening in the progeny of the double cross. BC 1 F 3 and DCF 3 lines were advanced to field testing in the Fall of 2007. In subsequent generations, these lines will allow for testing hypotheses regarding the pleiotropic effects of <b>waxy</b> <b>starch</b> on β-glucan and vernalization genes on low temperature tolerance...|$|E

40|$|Rice starch {{is one of}} {{the major}} cereal {{starches}} with novel functional properties. Significant progress has been made in recent years on the characterization of rice starches separated from different rice cultivars. Studies have revealed that the molecular structure and functional properties are affected by rice germplasm, isolation procedure, climate, agronomic conditions, and grain development. Morphological studies (microscopy and particle size analysis) have reflected significant differences among rice starch granule shapes (polyhedral, irregular) and in granule size (2 to 7 mu m). Nonwaxy and long-grain rice starches show greater variation in granular size than the <b>waxy</b> <b>starches.</b> Rice starch granules are smaller than other cereal starches with amylose contents varying from virtually amylose-free in waxy to about 35 % in nonwaxy and long-grain rice starches. Amylose content appears to be the major factor controlling almost all physicochemical properties of rice starch due to its influence on pasting, gelatinization, retrogradation, syneresis, and other functional properties. <b>Waxy</b> rice <b>starches</b> have high swelling and solubility parameters, and larger relative crystallinity values than nonwaxy and long-grain starches.

It was found that the starch solubility increased with increasing the solution preparation temperature, pH, or the mass ratio of amylopectin to amylose. Three stages of starch dissolution (swelling – rupturing – releasing starch molecules/ghost) were observed, and the tendency for the rupturing followed the order of <b>waxy</b> <b>starch</b> > normal starch > G 50 > G 80, indicating that a starch with higher amylopectin content could be more readily dissolved. Micro-flotation tests were carried out for pure hematite and quartz and their mixture with these four starches dissolved at different temperatures and pHs. The results suggest that there is a strong correlation between starch solubility and the depressing ability. Among these starches tested, <b>waxy</b> <b>starch</b> and normal starch, which have relatively high amylopectin contents, are preferred for being used in the flotation separation of quartz from hematite as depressant after proper solution preparation...|$|E

40|$|Soft wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) quality tests (milling {{and baking}} quality) and starch {{characteristics}} (amylose concentration, X-ray diffractograms, thermal properties and pasting properties) were determined for eight granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS: waxy protein) genotypes {{in a soft}} wheat background. Lines carrying two null alleles showed reduced amylose concentrations relative to those of single null and wild-type lines. Milling and baking quality traits were clearly different between waxy (triple null) and the other genotypes. Waxy lines showed the highest alkaline water retention (AWRC) capacity; even though, the protein concentration was not signicantly different from some double null and single null lines. The typical A-type patterns of X-ray diffractograms were observed for all starches. <b>Waxy</b> <b>starch</b> showed higher crystallinity than non-waxy starches. Analysis by Rapid Viscoanalyser (RVA) showed distinctive differences among the eight genotypes. Waxy starches showed higher peak viscosity, lower peak temperature and shorter peak time than those of all other genotypes. The results suggest that baking quality of waxy wheat can not be predicted by either AWRC or protein concentration. The interactions based on biochemical analysis between protein and other fractions (amylose and amylopectin, damaged starch) of partially and fully waxy wheat ours must be assessed before baking quality can be predicted. Furthermore, waxy wheat may not be suitable for current application of soft wheat products; however, distinct properties of <b>waxy</b> <b>starch</b> may open the possibility of commercial use in novel applications. Also, double null and single null genotypes {{may be a good}} source of variation for specific end-use products...|$|E
40|$|This study {{determined}} {{the impact of}} starches on the properties of low fat rennet curd as measured by microstructural and instrumental analysis. In experiment 1, 17 starches were initially screened for swelling power, impact of curd yield at 5 g/L and 10 g/L in milk, and settling in rennet-induced partially acidified low fat curd. Starches examined were narrowed down to five in experiment 2; they included: modified <b>waxy</b> corn <b>starch,</b> <b>waxy</b> rice <b>starch,</b> instant tapioca starch, dextrin, and a modified tapioca starch. These starches were added to skim milk to make rennet-induced partially acidified milk gels. Gels were made by adding starch to skim milk, heating to gelatinize starch, followed by addition of rennet and glucono-delta-lactone (GDL) to induce gelation. Once gels were set they were cut and centrifuged to sediment the curd. The amount of starch lost in whey was quantified to estimate starch retention in the curd. Confocal laser scanning microscopy {{was used to determine}} starch impact on curd microstructure. Curds yields were 13. 1 %, 18. 4 %, 20. 7 %, 21. 5 %, 23. 5 %, and 13. 2 % for control gel, and gels containing waxy corn, waxy rice, instant tapioca, modified tapioca and dextrin starches, respectively. Estimated starch retentions in the curds were 71 %, 90 %, 90 %, 21 %, and 1 % for these curds. Waxy corn, waxy rice, and instant tapioca starches have the potential to improve the texture of low fat cheese because they are retained well in the protein network during coagulation and concentration of the milk proteins, and they generate interruptions in curd network that may help limit extensive protein-protein interactions. Modified tapioca starch causes the protein structure of the curd to be very loose, but it was not retained optimally in the curd. Also, because there were few distinct starch particles in the modified tapioca curd network, it is likely that when it is subjected to all the cheesemaking steps the same loose protein structure would not be observed. Dextrin was not retained well in the curd, nor did it disrupt the protein network, making it unsuitable for use in low fat cheese. 	In experiment 3, low fat cheddar cheeses were made with <b>waxy</b> corn <b>starch,</b> <b>waxy</b> rice <b>starch,</b> modified tapioca starch, and instant tapioca starch. Modified tapioca starch did not increase the moisture content of the cheese. <b>Waxy</b> corn <b>starch,</b> <b>waxy</b> rice <b>starch,</b> and instant tapioca starch all increased the moisture content of the cheeses significantly. However, when moisture contents of cheeses were over 61 %, the body of the cheese visibly softened during storage, making the cheese very pasty. When starch-containing cheeses had moisture levels lower than that, the curd did not knit together well...|$|R
