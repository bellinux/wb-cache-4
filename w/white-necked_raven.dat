50|$|In {{southern}} Africa {{the range}} overlaps with the white-necked raven.The pied crow is smaller {{and has a}} white chest and belly with a black, more delicate beak compared to the black chest and belly of the larger <b>white-necked</b> <b>raven</b> which also has a white tipped and weightier beak.|$|E
50|$|It nests {{in trees}} and on cliffs, {{apparently}} building a stick nest like the similar {{and much more}} widely distributed and studied <b>white-necked</b> <b>raven.</b> It lays three to five eggs. In one case, thick-billed ravens were observed to vigorously displace predatory Verreaux's eagle owls from their nest area.|$|E
2500|$|Home to the zoo's polar bears, this $23 million exhibit {{opened on}} March 1, 2006, and {{features}} an underwater viewing building, sea lion observation bubble and a 500-seat amphitheater for daily sea lion shows. This exhibit's theme {{is a tribute}} to the First Nations culture in Canada's western province British Columbia, [...] animals that inhabit the Pacific Northwest, and its horticulture. Messages of conservation inspired by Chief Seattle, a famous Native American chief, are sprinkled throughout the exhibit. Six hand-carved totem poles that stand throughout the area received a Native American blessing ceremony when they arrived at the zoo. The Northwest Passage is also home to the zoo's American bald eagles, black bears, and <b>white-necked</b> <b>ravens.</b>|$|R
40|$|During {{level flight}} at iom. s " 1 in a wind tunnel, <b>white-necked</b> <b>ravens</b> (Corvus cryptoleucus, mass 0 - 48 kg) {{exhibited}} {{an increase in}} body temperature to steady-state levels as high as 45 °C, exceeding resting levels by nearly 3 °C. This reflects the storage of {{up to half of}} the metabolic heat produced (Hp) during 5 min of flight. During steady-state flight, body heat was dissipated in part by respiratory evaporation and convection (13 - 40 % oiHv) evoked by increases in ventilation proportional to body temperature. Remain-ing heat was lost by cutaneous evaporation (10 % of Hv) as well as by radiation and convection from the external body surface. The results suggest strategies that might be used by ravens during flight under desert conditions...|$|R
50|$|Kenya has cheetahs (with an {{observation}} building), warthog, and a deck {{with a view}} of some springbok, lesser kudu, common eland, scimitar-horned oryx, and gray crowned cranes that roam across an African plain. saddle-billed storks and southern ground-hornbills make up the wetland-themed exhibits {{on the opposite side of}} the walkway. A bomas area, with huts to simulate a Kenyan village has lappet-faced vultures housed with <b>white-necked</b> <b>ravens,</b> Aldabra tortoises, bateleur eagles, red-flanked duikers, and blue duikers are worked into small exhibits. The walk-through Scrubland Aviary is home to several species of birds, including a white-cheeked turaco, white-faced whistling ducks, cattle egrets, a bare-faced go-away-bird, marbled ducks, lilac-breasted roller, taveta weavers, superb starlings, and a white-headed buffalo weaver, as well as side exhibits for red ruffed lemurs and silvery-cheeked hornbills.|$|R
50|$|Africa {{is home to}} {{numerous}} songbirds (pipits, orioles, antpeckers, brubrus, cisticolas, negrofinches, olivebacks, pytilias, green-backed twinspot, crimson-wings, seedcrackers, bluebills, firefinches, waxbills, amandavas, quailfinches, munias, weavers, tit-hylia, Amadina, Anthoscopus, Mirafra, Hypargos, Eremomela, Euschistospiza, Erythrocercus, Malimbus, Pitta, Uraeginthus, pied crow, <b>white-necked</b> <b>raven,</b> thick-billed raven, Cape crow and others). The red-billed quelea is the most abundant bird species in the world.|$|E
50|$|Often {{described}} as a raven with a sore throat, it has very similar calls to the common raven, but with a more husky note. It has a croak like the other raven species but with a more whispering note. Like all corvids, the <b>White-necked</b> <b>raven</b> is capable of vocal mimicry. However, this behavior is only ever recorded in captivity.|$|E
50|$|The <b>white-necked</b> <b>raven</b> has a {{much shorter}} tail than the common raven, {{as well as a}} deeper bill with a white tip that is almost as {{strongly}} arched as that of the thick-billed raven. Though predominantly black, the throat, breast and neck show a faint purple gloss. There is a large patch of white feathers on the nape of the neck.|$|E
50|$|It is {{approximately}} {{the size of}} the European carrion crow (46-52 cm in length) but has a longer bill, slightly longer tail and wings, and longer legs. As its name suggests, its glossy black head and neck are interrupted by a large area of white feathering from the shoulders down to the lower breast but the tail, bill and wings are black. The eyes of a fully matured bird are dark brown. The white plumage of immature birds is often mixed with black. It resembles the <b>White-necked</b> and thick-billed <b>ravens</b> but is much smaller, less stocky and has a smaller bill.|$|R
50|$|The <b>white-necked</b> <b>raven</b> (Corvus albicollis) is {{somewhat}} smaller (50-54 cm in length) than the common raven or indeed its nearest relative, the thick-billed raven C. crassirostris. Like the common raven, thick-billed raven and brown-necked raven, {{it is one}} of the larger raven species. The smaller raven species are the Australian raven, forest raven, little raven, fan-tailed raven and Chihuahuan raven with the thick-billed raven being the world's largest raven species and the Chihuahuan raven being the smallest.|$|E
50|$|The Chihuahuan raven (Corvus cryptoleucus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Corvidae that is native to the United States and Mexico. It was {{formerly}} known as the American <b>white-necked</b> <b>raven,</b> and has the proportions of a common raven with a heavy bill, but is about the same size as a carrion crow, or slightly larger than the American crow (44 - 51 cm long). The plumage is all-black with a rich purple-blue gloss in good light. Like the forest raven, little raven, fan-tailed raven and Australian raven, {{it is one of the}} smaller raven species. The larger species of raven are the common raven, thick-billed raven, <b>white-necked</b> <b>raven</b> and brown-necked raven, with the common and thick-billed ravens being the world's largest raven species and the little and fan-tailed ravens being the smallest. The Chihuahuan raven is very similar in appearance to the Australian raven, although with dark brown irises and whiter feather bases. The nasal bristles extend farther down the top of the bill than in any other Corvus species to about two-thirds the length. The base of the neck feathers are white-ish (seen only when ruffled in strong wind). The bill, legs and feet are black.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} species of corvid which {{occur in the}} region, three native and one {{introduced}} (the house crow, likely ship-assisted). The pied crow is widespread and common including in urban areas, with the <b>white-necked</b> <b>raven,</b> the largest corvid in the region, inhabiting mountainous areas and increasingly in urban areas. The Cape crow is mainly restricted to rural habitats. The house crow {{can be found in}} Cape Town and Durban, where control measures have been implemented with varying degrees of success.|$|E
50|$|The {{fan-tailed raven}} (Corvus rhipidurus) is a {{passerine}} bird of the crow family native to Eastern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Like the Forest raven, Little raven, Australian raven and Chihuahuan raven, {{it is one}} of the smaller raven species. The larger species of raven are the Common raven, Thick-billed raven, <b>White-necked</b> <b>raven</b> and Brown-necked raven with the Common and Thick-billed ravens being the world's largest raven species and the Little and Fan-tailed ravens being the smallest, in fact it is about the same size or slightly larger than the carrion crow (47-51 cm) but with a much thicker bill, shorter tail and much larger wings.|$|E
50|$|Most of this bird's food is {{obtained}} from the ground, {{but it will take}} food from trees as well. It has been seen to drop a tortoise from a height on to hard ground, preferably on rocks, and then swoop down to eat it, or even pick it up again if not sufficiently broken. White-necked ravens will also readily take carrion from road kills. Fruit, grain, insects, small reptiles, peanuts and human food are also readily taken and the bird forages in back yards and gardens quite openly. Like all or most raven species, the <b>White-necked</b> <b>raven</b> form flocks after leaving their parents and once fully matured will pair off and form territories.It is often found in the company of other scavengers such as kites or vultures.|$|E
50|$|The {{brown-necked raven}} (Corvus ruficollis) {{is a larger}} bird (52-56 cm in length) than the carrion crow though not {{as large as the}} common raven. It has similar {{proportions}} to the common raven but the bill is not so large or deep and the wings tend {{to be a little more}} pointed in profile. The head and throat are a distinct brownish-black giving the bird its English name, while the rest of the plumage is black glossed with purple, blue or purplish-blue. Like the Common raven, Thick-billed raven and <b>White-necked</b> <b>raven,</b> it is one of the larger raven species. The smaller raven species are the Australian raven, Forest raven, Little raven, Fan-tailed raven and Chihuahuan raven with the Thick-billed raven being the world's largest raven species and the Chihuahuan raven being the smallest. The feathers of this species often fade quite quickly to a brownish black (even the truly black feathers) and the bird can look distinctly brown by the time it moults. The feet, legs and bill are black. The dwarf raven was formerly considered a subspecies (Corvus ruficollis edithae) but this bird now appears to be closer to the pied crow (C. albus) than this species.|$|E
5000|$|In South Africa, the commonest foods were (in {{descending}} order of preference): Cape hyrax, Smith's red rock hare (Pronolagus rupertris), meerkat, mountain reedbuck (Redunca fulvorufula), goats and sheep, scrub hare (Lepus saxatilis), Cape francolin (Francolinus capensis), helmeted guineafowl(Numida meleagris), yellow mongoose (Cynictis penicillata) and Angulate tortoise (Chersina angulata). In “poor food areas” of the Matobo Hills, three nests included 53.6% hyrax, 10.7% cane-rats, 7.1% monkeys, 7.1% mongoose and 3.6% antelope. [...] From 1997 to 2005 {{in the same}} area, non-hyrax prey (each representing less than 10 out of 1550 prey items at nests) included white-tailed mongoose (Ichneumia albicauda), steenbok (Raphicerus campestris), domestic goat, vervet monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus), Jameson's red rock hare (Pronolagus randensis), helmeted guineafowl, Swainson's francolin (Pternistis swainsonii), Natal francolin (Pternistis natalensis), southern red-billed hornbill (Tockus rufirostris), rock pigeon (Columba livia), <b>white-necked</b> <b>raven</b> (Corvus albicollis), leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis) and giant plated lizard (Gerrhosaurus validus). In the Walter Sisulu National Botanical Garden of South Africa, the primary prey found around nests after a perceptible hyrax decline has become helmeted guineafowl and francolins, followed by cane rats, rabbits and dikdiks (Rhynchotragus ssp.). Young baboons may also be hunted, even the large-bodied chacma baboons (Papio ursinus) which have issued a predator alarm call {{in response to the}} presence of Verreaux's eagles. Carrion either fairly frequent or none at all. [...] A study of the taking of domestic lambs in the Karoo found only two cases of lambs being eaten by Verreaux's eagle and these were already dead when carried off. This contrasts with the golden eagle, which in some areas may eat many dead lambs and occasionally hunt lives ones. Although any prey weighing over 4.5 kg is rarely taken, some ungulates hunted by Verreaux's eagles can be considerably larger. Klipspringer (Oreotragus oreotragus) lambs brought to the nest have weighed up to 12 kg. A Verreaux's eagle was observed to hunt and kill a mountain reedbuck lamb estimated to weigh 15 kg.|$|E
40|$|Rule {{governance}} {{is critical}} to human society. However, could rule governance be found in non-human animals? A six year old, female, African <b>white-necked</b> <b>raven</b> (Covrus albicollis) named Shade correctly followed informal verbal commands to retrieve specified objects in the past. This ability was tested using two different methods. Both methods involved the researcher verbally asking the bird to retrieve one object out of two either from the same room or an adjacent room. While initial results {{were not significantly different}} than chance, review of trial recordings revealed {{that it is possible to}} predict when the bird will retrieve an incorrect object based solely on specific behaviors, termed inattentive or uninterested. Trials marked as inattentive by observers were significantly more likely to be incorrect than correct. This indicates that the bird was capable of retrieving the correct object, but that she also occasionally, intentionally retrieved the incorrect object...|$|E
40|$|The family Corivdae, which {{includes}} crows and ravens, contains arguably {{some of the}} most intelligent species the animal kingdom has to offer. Separated from primates by at least 252 million years of evolution, birds bear striking physiological differences from mammals, while displaying similar intellectual abilities. This apparent convergent evolution of intelligence sheds light on what could possibly be a universal phenomenon. While many excellent studies show the abilities of corvids, the majority of them test only captive subjects. This study tested the capabilities of both captive and wild ravens, from three different species. The first portion of the study tested which of the four solutions offered wild ravens would choose when solving a Multi-Access Box. The second portion of the study tested the performance of wild and captive ravens when solving a Multi-Latch Box. The nine raven subjects were split into four different levels of enculturation based on their known histories. Two wild common ravens (Corvus corax) {{on the campus of the}} University of Arizona were level 1, four wild common ravens in the parking lot of a United States Forest Service parking lot were level 2, two captive and trained Chihuahuan ravens (Corvus cryptoleucus) from the Raptor Free Flight program at the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum comprised level 3, and one captive and trained <b>white-necked</b> <b>raven</b> (Corvus albicollis) made level 4. It is possible to run trials with completely wild and free birds. It was found that ravens prefer direct methods of obtaining food, such as opening doors and pulling strings, instead of tool use. It was also found that while the relationship between enculturation level and success solving a puzzle was not linear, captive birds were the best solvers. The data given here suggest that captivity, training and enrichment history, and enculturation should all be considered when performing cognitive studies with animals...|$|E
40|$|When heavy raven {{concentrations}} occur, {{the crops}} must be protected. As effective control is impossible when natural food is abundant, {{it is generally}} necessary to resort of frightening measures until winter sets in and the food supply becomes low enough to insure control success. Various contrivances to scare the birds away may {{be placed in the}} fields, but the shotgun is without question the best frightening device. The most successful, selective and humane control measure is the use of large cage traps. As the need for control is usually local and varies by seasons, depending upon the crop situation, the soundest policy is to resort of it only when necessary and {{to take advantage of the}} bird's better attributes at all other times. The omnivorous food habits of this raven often bring it into direct competition with farming interests, and frequently its depredations result in severe damage to crops, particularly to grain sorghums, corn, melons, peanuts, pecans, weak lambs, and poultry. To reduce these attacks and keep the losses at a minimum often is expensive and requires considerable work on the part of ranchers and farmers. On the other hand nearly half the raven's food is of animal origin and includes a wide assortment of insects, many of which are harmful to crops. Grasshoppers, weevils, May beetles, caterpillars, fly maggots, and like pests constitute a material part of the insect diet. Carrion is another important food of the raven, and its removal from the range is a definite aid to sanitation. The <b>white-necked</b> <b>raven</b> (Corvus cryptoleucus), a close relative of the common crow, is indigenous to southwestern United States. Because in parts of its range it has gained the same ill repute as acquired by the crow and magpie in their respective ranges, a 5 -year detailed study of its activities and food habits was made, during which many field data were gathered, and the contents of 827 stomachs were analyzed.
