5|$|The Venezuelan intern Jhonny (JC Gonzalez) {{falls in}} love with April (Aubrey Plaza), who convinces him she is feared and very powerful. Jhonny is crazy and fell in love for April and sent her his car to pick her up but she used his car to go to movies with her friends. Meanwhile, Leslie tells the Venezuelans that she is seeking to raise $35,000 to fill in a pit to make a park. Raul and his colleagues start to laugh, telling her they have so much money from oil, they can build {{whatever}} they want. Leslie, who is growing increasingly annoyed with the Venezuelans, decides to take them to Pawnee's nicest park with hopes of impressing them. Instead, they are disgusted, and Raul mistakes the park for the aforementioned pit. Leslie later takes them to a public meeting to show them democracy in action, but all of the citizens shout angry and annoyed questions at Leslie. An unimpressed Raul wonders <b>where</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> armed guards to take the protestors to jail. When Raul tells Leslie they live like kings in Venezuela and answer to nobody, she explodes in anger, insulting their uniforms and Hugo Chavez. The Venezuelans storm out.|$|E

25|$|Perhaps {{they have}} written exhaustively on this topic, {{and their work}} did not reach us. There are many sciences. There have been {{numerous}} sages among the nations of mankind. The knowledge that has not come down to us {{is larger than the}} knowledge that has. <b>Where</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> sciences of the Persians that ‘Umar ordered to be wiped out {{at the time of the}} conquest? <b>Where</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> sciences of the Chaladaeans, the Syrians and the Babylonians, and the scholarly products and results that were theirs? <b>Where</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> sciences of the Copts, their predecessors? The sciences of only one nation, the Greeks, have come down to us, because they were translated through Al-Ma'mun's efforts. He was successful in this direction because he had many translators at his disposal and spent much money in this connection.|$|E
500|$|<b>Where</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Cows? {{is one of}} Abbott's most {{difficult}} mazes. It first appeared in his book SuperMazes. Abbott warns readers that it [...] "may be too difficult for anyone to solve." [...] Since then, it has also appeared as the titular maze in the book Cows in the Maze.|$|E

500|$|Theseus and the Minotaur {{is another}} of Abbott's better-known mazes. It first {{appeared}} in his book Mad Mazes. Like <b>Where</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Cows? in SuperMazes, Abbott says that this [...] "is the hardest maze in the book; in fact, {{it is possible that}} no one will solve it." [...] Since then, several different versions of it have appeared, made by others, following the same theme, both on paper and in electronic forms.|$|E
500|$|After {{the initial}} excitement, audiences quickly diminished. Operagoers were nonplussed {{by the absence}} of big {{traditional}} arias and choruses. A contemporary critic summed it up: [...] "'Is this our Verdi?' they asked themselves. 'But where is the motive; <b>where</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> broad melodies... <b>where</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> usual ensembles; the finales?'" [...] By the time of Verdi's death in 1901 the work had fallen out of the international repertoire. The rising young conductor Arturo Toscanini was a strong advocate of the work, and did much to save it from neglect. As musical director of La Scala (from 1898) and the Metropolitan Opera (from 1908), he programmed Falstaff from the start of his tenure. Richard Aldrich, music critic of The New York Times, wrote that Toscanini's revival [...] "ought to be marked in red letters in the record of the season. Falstaff, which was first produced here on Feb.4. 1895, has not been given since the following season, and was heard in these two seasons only half a dozen times in all." [...] Aldrich added that though the general public might have had difficulty with the work, [...] "to connoisseurs it was an unending delight".|$|E
500|$|The {{complexity}} in <b>Where</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Cows? includes self-reference, changing rules, and flow charts. It is also worded {{so as to}} provoke confusion between an object (such as red text), a reference to an object (such as the word [...] "red"), and even more subtle references (the word [...] "word"). The maze ends up being so complicated that it can even be difficult {{to work out the}} next move, let alone the end. In this maze, you have to use two hands, each starting at a different place. The instructions in one box might {{have to do with the}} box that the other hand is in, boxes you have already left, or complex combinations of the two.|$|E

500|$|In 1998, Shakira {{released}} her second major label studio album Dónde Están los Ladrones? (<b>Where</b> <b>Are</b> <b>the</b> Thieves?), {{which became a}} success in Latin America and received record certifications in various countries like Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Mexico and Spain. The rock en español-influenced Latin pop album drew comparisons {{to the work of}} Canadian-American singer songwriter Alanis Morissette and [...] "cracked the lucrative US market wide open", spending a total of 11 weeks atop the Billboard Top Latin Albums chart. It became Shakira's first album to receive a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Dónde Están los Ladrones? spawned the Arabian-styled single [...] "Ojos Así" [...] ("Eyes Like Yours"), which became a hit and was deemed the [...] "signature track" [...] of the album.|$|E
500|$|Since then, Abbott {{has created}} various mazes, {{most of which}} {{appeared}} in the books SuperMazes and Mad Mazes. In 2008, RBA Libros published a Spanish version of his book Abbott's New Card Games, under the title Diez juegos que no se parecen a nada, which translates to Ten games that do not resemble anything. This version was not just a Spanish translation of the original, however; the most up-to-date rules for the various games were used; in addition, the rules for Eleusis Express and Confusion were included. [...] In 2010, his <b>Where</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> Cows? maze was published by the Oxford University Press in the book Cows in the Maze. In 2011, his game Confusion was published by Stronghold Games. The game was named [...] "Best New Abstract Strategy Game" [...] for 2012 by GAMES Magazine.|$|E
500|$|Continuing his {{services}} from the prior season, Dana Gonzales oversaw {{production of the}} show's second season. The cinematographer took cues from William Eggleston to develop a retro visual palette. To achieve this quality, Gonzales relied on vintage practical lighting technology, and captured scenes with an Arri ALEXA camera, retrofitted with vintage Cooke lenses. In one section of Calgary where they were filming, production staff replaced each sodium-lamp street light with tungsten light bulbs, creating an ambience that [...] "pulls the audience into the world when the story takes place". Also, once Hawley analyzed the 1968 thriller film The Boston Strangler, split screen effects were employed to help streamline the narrative during transitions. Gonzales said: [...] "We felt that split-screen would be an incredible way to track all these characters and locations within the episode: Where's the Gerhardt family? <b>Where</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> guys from Kansas City? Where's Peggy? Where's Ed?" ...|$|E

500|$|The cost of {{the tickets}} was too high for many fans in South America, so the band {{broadcast}} the 11 February concert in Chile live on television. Knowing {{that many people in}} the country would be watching, they played [...] "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] in place of [...] "Wake Up Dead Man". The stadium in which the concert was held had been used as a prison camp by Pinochet's regime following the coup d'état. Again it was performed solely by Bono and the Edge against footage of the Madres, and they invited the women to join them onstage a second time. The Madres held up photographs of their children and spoke about them briefly during the performance, an act which received a mixed reception from the audience. Bono made a plea to Pinochet, asking him to [...] "tell these women <b>where</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> bones of their children." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> Chuci <b>is</b> an {{anthology}} of Chinese poems (see Qu Yuan) from the southern state of Chu, and it mentions bashe in the Tianwen 天問 [...] "Heavenly Questions" [...] section. The preeminent Chuci translator David Hawkes (1985:126) describes the Tianwen as a [...] "somewhat odd combination of archaic riddles with questions of a speculative or philosophical nature" [...] and believes [...] "it started as an ancient, priestly riddle-text (a sort of catechism {{to be used for}} mnemonic purposes) which was rewritten and greatly enlarged by a secular poet".
