5|$|I {{read this}} book, and I was totally stunned. At {{the same time}} I was pretty upset <b>with</b> <b>myself</b> that I didn't know this book. I live in Amsterdam where Anne Frank is a {{national}} hero, and for me this book read like Anne Frank's diary but written 97 years before– a firsthand account of slavery. I basically made it my passion to make this book into a film.|$|E
5|$|I have labored {{to make a}} {{covenant}} <b>with</b> <b>myself,</b> that affection may not press upon judgment; for I suppose there is no man that hath any apprehension of gentry or nobleness, but his affection stands to the continuance of a house so illustrious, and would take hold of a twig or twine-thread to support it. And yet time hath his revolutions; {{there must be a}} period and an end to all temporal things—finis rerum—an end of names and dignities, and whatsoever is terrene; and why not of de Vere? For where is Bohun? Where is Mowbray? Where is Mortimer? Nay, which is more, and most of all, where is Plantagenet? They are entombed in the urns and sepulchres of mortality! yet let the name of de Vere stand so long as it pleaseth God.|$|E
5|$|I {{longed for}} real companionship, for {{apart from that}} life had nothing to offer me in Darmstadt...So {{naturally}} I am bitterly disappointed <b>with</b> <b>myself</b> when I look back, and see {{that in spite of}} great ambitions, good intentions, and real effort, my hopes have nevertheless been completely ship-wrecked...You say, darling, that you would never have caused me hardship intentionally...I only regret the lack of any intention or desire – or rather insight – to be more to me, and that does not mean spending all your time with me, without wishing to share anything with me at the same time. But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – things that have happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

25|$|In 1963, Evans {{recorded}} Conversations <b>with</b> <b>Myself,</b> {{an innovative}} solo album using the unconventional (in jazz solo recordings) technique of overdubbing over himself. In 1966, he met bassist Eddie Gómez, {{with whom he}} would work for eleven years. Many successful albums followed, in trio, duo, and solo settings, such as Bill Evans at the Montreux Jazz Festival, Alone, and The Bill Evans Album, among others.|$|E
25|$|When he re-formed his trio in 1962, two albums, Moon Beams and How My Heart Sings! resulted. In 1963, {{after having}} {{switched}} from Riverside to {{the much more}} widely distributed Verve (for financial reasons related to his drug addiction), he recorded Conversations <b>with</b> <b>Myself,</b> an innovative album which featured overdubbing, layering up to three individual tracks of piano for each song. The album won him his first Grammy award.|$|E
25|$|My God, {{in union}} with the Immaculate Heart of Mary I offer Thee the Precious Blood of Jesus from all the altars {{throughout}} the world, joining with it the offering of my every thought, action and suffering of this day.

5000|$|The Trouble <b>with</b> Being <b>Myself</b> is {{the third}} studio album by American singer-songwriter Macy Gray, {{released}} on April 28, 2003 by Epic Records. The album peaked at number 44 on the Billboard 200, and by February 2007, it had sold 134,000 copies in the United States. Despite not being a major commercial success for Gray, The Trouble <b>with</b> Being <b>Myself</b> received mostly positive reviews. The album spawned the single [...] "When I See You".|$|R
500|$|Kafka {{grew up in}} Prague as a German-speaking Jew. He {{was deeply}} fascinated by the Jews of Eastern Europe, who he thought possessed an {{intensity}} of spiritual life that was absent from Jews in the West. His diary is full of references to Yiddish writers. Yet he was at times alienated from Judaism and Jewish life: [...] "What have I in common with Jews? I have hardly anything in common <b>with</b> <b>myself</b> and should stand very quietly in a corner, content that I can breathe". In his adolescent years, Kafka had declared himself an atheist.|$|E
500|$|Other {{accomplished}} {{early works}} include the two string quartets, composed between 1928 and 1930, in which Tippett sought {{to combine the}} styles of Beethoven and Haydn respectively with folk-song, as Beethoven had in his Rasumovsky quartets of 1806. Tippett explains the withdrawal of these and the other early works: [...] "I realised very clearly {{that they were not}} totally consonant <b>with</b> <b>myself.</b> I didn't think they had the stamp of artistic durability. So I took the whole lot along to R.O. Morris who agreed that they didn't show enough technical mastery." ...|$|E
500|$|Willis reprised {{his most}} famous role, John McClane, for a fifth time, {{starring}} in A Good Day to Die Hard, which was released on February 14, 2013. In an interview, Willis said, [...] "I have a warm spot in my heart for Die Hard..... it's just the sheer novelty {{of being able to}} play the same character over 25 years and still be asked back is fun. It's much more challenging to have to do a film again and try to compete <b>with</b> <b>myself,</b> which is what I do in Die Hard. I try to improve my work every time." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{inspiration}} {{is taken}} from my own life, but also all my girlfriends who are very strong, confident girls {{who want to be}} their best in all levels of life. They’re kind of like overachievers and never seem to be satisfied with how [...] they achieve in life. I can see that <b>with</b> <b>myself</b> as well because you expect so much from yourself. You expect yourself to be the best friend, have a great career, be really talented and be able to cook—you just have to be great at everything. I think genders have been washed out a little bit -- like you have to have masculine qualities as well as feminine. It’s just a song that recognizes {{what it takes to be}} a girl today, and it’s quite a lot.|$|E
500|$|Washing Machine is the {{follow-up}} to Sonic Youth's 1994 DGC album Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star. After Experimental Jet Set, the band {{decided to take}} a hiatus from performing live and concentrated on numerous side projects. Band member Kim Gordon played with Julia Cafritz of Pussy Galore in Free Kitten, drummer Steve Shelley performed with Jad Fair in Mosquito, guitarist Lee Ranaldo played with free jazz drummer William Hooker and singer/guitarist Thurston Moore released his first solo album, Psychic Hearts. Moore and Gordon also had their first child, Coco. According to Moore, their daughter had provided a different perspective for the band: [...] "I'm more focused and level-headed. There's a sublime awareness factor of your spiritual place in the world. I feel more at ease <b>with</b> <b>myself...</b> Babies are little Buddhas. They're completely great".|$|E
500|$|Iñárritu {{has made}} a special point of {{emphasizing}} the importance of historical issues of ethnicity approached in the film and reflected in the mixed ethnic background of Hugh Glass's son portrayed in the film (portrayed as half Pawnee by Glass's wife) as relating to his own life and his identification with ethnic concerns. Iñárritu has referred to having encountered constant xenophobia and stated that: [...] "These constant and relentless xenophobic (comments) have been widely spread by the media without shame, embraced and cheered by leaders and communities around the U.S. The foundation {{of all this is}} so outrageous that it can easily be minimized as an SNL sketch, a mere entertainment, a joke ... I debated <b>with</b> <b>myself,</b> if I should bring up this uncomfortable subject tonight but in light of the constant and relentless xenophobic comments that have been expressed recently against my Mexican fellows, it is inevitable." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Oh {{it was so}} fun, it was amazing. For me it {{was like}} being on a Martin Scorsese set. I've been so low budget for so long, and to have this {{incredibly}} amazing video was really very humbling. It was really fun, but you'll see if you ever come to a video shoot of mine one day– I'm very private about those things, I don't really talk to everybody. I'm not like the party girl running around. I might even seem to {{be a bit of a}} diva. I'm sort of <b>with</b> <b>myself,</b> in my work head space worrying about costumes, and if extras look right, and placement. I don't just show up for things, you know. That video was a vision of mine. It was Melina the director who wanted to do something, to have a performance art aspect that was so pop but it was still commercial, but that felt like lifestyle. It was all those things, I love it." ...|$|E
500|$|Author Robert Rodriguez writes that, {{although}} the brevity of each selection allowed little opportunity for progression beyond a basic motif, [...] "sonically, the range explored {{even within the}} Western cues was astonishing". He adds: [...] "The Indian cuts too were quite varied stylistically, showing open-minded listeners {{that there was more}} to the country's music than twanging sitars and thumping tablas." [...] Simon Leng considers Wonderwall Music to be [...] "a companion in spirit" [...] to Bill Evans' Conversations <b>with</b> <b>Myself</b> (1963), due to the doubling of the lead instrument in some of the Indian pieces; he comments on the significance of Harrison recording in India in January 1968: [...] "There were now three Beatles who held firm artistic visions. The group was unraveling in earnest." [...] Leng praises [...] "Dream Scene" [...] in particular, describing it as a [...] "musical acid trip" [...] that [...] "rivals anything on Sgt. Pepper for sheer freak-out effect".|$|E
500|$|In a December 2012 interview, Winkelman {{expressed}} some regret {{about what}} had happened. [...] "I'm not {{proud of the way}} this club came to exist, and I am totally prepared to be the villain of the piece, but I can't put the genie back in the bottle," [...] he said. [...] "Do I think it was right? No. Do I think it was a great thing that happened to Wimbledon? No... I don’t feel in the right over the way this club was born. But I don’t think I could live <b>with</b> <b>myself</b> if I hadn't gone out and bought the club when it was hours away from liquidation. It was about to be completely finito... What happened was my fault, and I have to take responsibility for it. But I don’t see why my players, staff and our young supporter base should be forced to carry the can and live with the nastiness, it's nothing to do with them." ...|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft {{was forced}} to write the Rights of Woman hurriedly to respond to Talleyrand and ongoing events. Upon {{completing}} the work, she wrote to her friend William Roscoe: [...] "I am dissatisfied <b>with</b> <b>myself</b> for not having done justice to the subject.– Do not suspect me of false modesty– I {{mean to say that}} had I allowed myself more time I could have written a better book, {{in every sense of the}} word... I intend to finish the next volume before I begin to print, for it is not pleasant to have the Devil coming for the conclusion of a sheet fore it is written." [...] When Wollstonecraft revised the Rights of Woman for the second edition, she took the opportunity not only to fix small spelling and grammar mistakes but also to bolster the feminist claims of her argument. She changed some of her statements regarding female and male difference to reflect a greater equality between the sexes.|$|E
500|$|Although forty-eight {{drivers were}} {{entered in the}} qualifier; {{according}} to NASCAR's qualifying procedure, only forty-three could race. Each driver ran two laps, with the starting order determined by the competitor's fastest times. Johnson clinched his fifth pole position of the season, {{with a time of}} 31.049. He was joined on the grid's front row by Scott Speed. Marcos Ambrose qualified third, Martin took fourth and Stewart started fifth. Harvick, Newman, Greg Biffle, Bill Elliott and Bowyer completed the top ten fastest qualifiers. Kurt Busch, one of the drivers in the Chase for the Sprint Cup, qualified twelfth, while Jeff Gordon set the twentieth fastest time. The five drivers who failed to qualify were Joe Nemechek, Dave Blaney, Mike Skinner, Max Papis and David Stremme. After the qualifier Johnson said, [...] "I had a talk <b>with</b> <b>myself</b> to do what I could today and don't freak out if it's not as good as what Mark [...] ran. I kept my emotions in check and drove the car with the right touch and feel, and that comes from being relaxed, so it went well." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{eight of}} the nine ATP 1000 events, Raonic matched or {{improved}} on his career-best performance. This included his first ATP 1000 series final at the Canadian Open in August. During his third round victory over del Potro, Raonic was awarded a point even though his foot touched the net. He did not report his error to the umpire, and won the last nine points to close out the match. Raonic later admitted that he was wrong not to admit his error at the time: [...] "I {{made a mistake in}} {{the spur of the moment}} ... I'm disappointed <b>with</b> <b>myself,</b> how I dealt with it." [...] After beating Ernests Gulbis in the quarterfinals, Raonic defeated compatriot Pospisil in the semifinals. The match against Pospisil was the first all-Canadian semifinal in an ATP 1000 tournament. In the final, he lost to Nadal in just 68 minutes. Following the tournament, Raonic was ranked No. 10, becoming the first Canadian player and the first player born in the 1990s to break into the top10.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "De Profundis", Oscar Wilde writes {{from prison}} {{about his life}} regrets, stating [...] "I let myself be lured into long spells of {{senseless}} and sensual ease. I amused <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> being a flaneur, a dandy, a man of fashion. I surrounded <b>myself</b> <b>with</b> the smaller natures and the meaner minds." ...|$|R
