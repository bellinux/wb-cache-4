According to {{requirements}} of the natural and economic laws, the environmental <b>management</b> of <b>watershed</b> distinction is inevitable for improvement of <b>watershed</b> environmental <b>management</b> effect. In the paper, the Nine-division Principle is set forth, i. e. division by watershed, area, sequence, stage, type, grade, duty, right and policy through analysis of <b>watershed</b> distinction <b>management</b> in system theory and behavior economics, and of regional sub-characteristics of watershed in geographical elements, functions and economic developments. Under the guide of Nine-division principle, the idea on the environmental <b>management</b> of <b>watershed</b> distinction is reflected and implemented smoothly by dividing watershed environmental and economical function region, ways of optimizing the <b>watershed</b> environmental <b>management,</b> and creating conditions for implementation of environmental <b>management</b> of <b>watershed</b> distinction...|$|R

Since the early 1990s both institutions have supported <b>watershed</b> <b>management</b> in rural Maharashtra, using a participatory approach first piloted by the Social Center in Ahmednagar and that constituted a fundamental break with the previous top-down, technical approach to <b>watershed</b> <b>management</b> that had yielded little results. The involvement of women in decision-making {{is an essential part}} of the project. While the benefits are mostly in terms of increased agricultural production, the project also increases availability of water resources for rural water supply. In addition, GIZ actively supports the introduction of ecological sanitation concepts in India, including community toilets and decentralised wastewater systems for schools as well as small and medium enterprises. Many of these systems produce biogas from wastewater, provide fertiliser and irrigation water.|$|E
25|$|Water {{resources}} {{management in}} the country, in particular water quality, quantity and <b>Watershed</b> <b>management</b> faces major challenges today. Despite {{of the lack of}} systematic data limiting an accurate and detailed assessment of the scope of the problems, there is a consensus that: (i) the overall poor quality of surface, groundwater and coastal water resources {{is the result of a}} lack of waste water management and agricultural run-off, causing health problems that disproportionally affect the poor; (ii) water scarcity is a regional problem resulting from poor demand management in irrigation, urban water supply and tourist infrastructure in drier regions; (iii) weak <b>watershed</b> <b>management</b> leads to soil erosion and amplifies the damage and frequency of flooding; and (iv) the overall lack of solid waste management pollutes water sources, causes disease and is a nuisance for inhabitants and visitors alike. The DR government is in the process of reducing its role as main investor for water resources infrastructure and services provider decentralizing some responsibilities to local and regional government, water users organizations, and private companies.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} states without {{wetlands}} laws on their books still have other state environmental laws dealing with water quality or natural resources, and they may already provide substantial authority to regulate wetlands. However, a comprehensive picture of states' ability to protect wetlands, under various possible authorities, is difficult to draw together. To {{fill in the gap}} left by removal of some federal regulatory jurisdiction, states could adopt more comprehensive wetlands regulatory statutes or wetland amendments to state pollution control statutes (possibly including independent water quality certification programs) and rules. The latter, for example, could integrate wetlands, water quality, and <b>watershed</b> <b>management.</b> States do not have the constitutional constraints that the federal government does in enacting legislation (whether a legislative action exceeds Congress' power under the Commerce Clause). Also, CWA section 404(t) expressly provides that the existence of section 404 does not preempt state law governing the discharge of dredged or fill material. However, whether states will take steps to expand wetlands protection in response to the Court's decision raises difficult political and resource questions. It is quite likely that, among states, the SWANCC decision pleases some states and is opposed by others.|$|E

A Water Demand Management (WDM) Unit was established at the Ministry of Water and Irrigation with assistance from USAID, and a WDM curriculum has been inserted into Jordanian classroom textbooks from grades 1 through 11. A Master's degree program has been established at Jordan University of Science and Technology, and journalists have been trained. Auditing and retrofitting of public and private buildings (hotels, schools, hospitals, government and commercial) indicated that 40 to 60% are now using water-saving devices. A “model” community was rehabilitated to demonstrate water and associated energy conservation. Twenty-seven grants have been awarded to poor communities to alleviate water shortages and inefficient water usage. Furthermore, training courses under a program with Washington State University have been completed for more than 800 employees from the Jordan Valley Authority, Water Authority of Jordan and Ministry of Water and Irrigation to improve and standardize accounting systems, and to improve efficiency.|$|E

Shortly thereafter, Congress rescinded the Bull Run Trespass Act {{and replaced it}} with the Bull Run <b>Watershed</b> <b>Management</b> Act of 1977, which created the Bull Run <b>Watershed</b> <b>Management</b> Unit (BRWMU) (replacing the Bull Run Reserve) and legalized further Bull Run logging unless it could be shown to reduce water quality. Logging and the debate about logging continued. In 1994 about 75percent of the BRWMU was made into a reserve for protecting the northern spotted owl and other species dependent on old-growth forests. In February 1996, runoff from unusually heavy rains in the watershed washed so much eroded soil into the Bull Run storage reservoirs that the City had to shut down the Bull Run supply and switch during the crisis to its emergency supply from a well field along the Columbia River. Later in 1996, Congress passed the Oregon Resources Conservation Act, which prohibited logging on all Forest Service lands within the Bull Run water supply drainage and another [...] of land that drained to the lower Bull Run River. In 2001, the Little Sandy Act extended the prohibitions to the entire BRWMU and public lands along the Little Sandy River.|$|E
