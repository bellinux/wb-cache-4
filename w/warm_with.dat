5|$|Malawi's {{climate is}} {{hot in the}} low-lying areas {{in the south of}} the country and {{temperate}} in the northern highlands. The altitude moderates what would otherwise be an equatorial climate. Between November and April the temperature is <b>warm</b> <b>with</b> equatorial rains and thunderstorms, with the storms reaching their peak severity in late March. After March, the rainfall rapidly diminishes and from May to September wet mists float from the highlands into the plateaus, with almost no rainfall during these months.|$|E

This offers the village more sunny days than much of the British Isles, and fewer frosts.|$|E
5|$|Southern Manitoba (including {{the city}} of Winnipeg), falls into the humid {{continental}} climate zone (Köppen Dfb). This area is cold and windy {{in the winter and}} has frequent blizzards because of the open landscape. Summers are <b>warm</b> <b>with</b> a moderate length. This region is the most humid area in the prairie provinces, with moderate precipitation. Southwestern Manitoba, though under the same climate classification as the rest of Southern Manitoba, is closer to the semi-arid interior of Palliser's Triangle. The area is drier and more prone to droughts than other parts of southern Manitoba. This area is cold and windy in the winter and has frequent blizzards due to the openness of the prairie landscape. Summers are generally warm to hot, with low to moderate humidity.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{most other}} marine mammals, the sea otter has no blubber and relies on its {{exceptionally}} thick fur to keep <b>warm.</b> <b>With</b> up to 150,000 {{strands of hair}} per square centimeter (nearly one million per sqin), its fur is the densest of any animal. The fur consists of long, waterproof guard hairs and short underfur; the guard hairs keep the dense underfur layer dry. Cold water is kept completely away from the skin and heat loss is limited. The fur is thick year-round, as it is shed and replaced gradually {{rather than in a}} distinct molting season. As the ability of the guard hairs to repel water depends on utmost cleanliness, the sea otter has the ability to reach and groom the fur on any part of its body, taking advantage of its loose skin and an unusually supple skeleton. The coloration of the pelage is usually deep brown with silver-gray speckles, but it can range from yellowish or grayish brown to almost black. In adults, the head, throat, and chest are lighter in color {{than the rest of the}} body.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} ultrastructural {{appearance}} of oocytes after vitrification and <b>warming</b> <b>with</b> two different devices. Design: Oocytes were examined by ultrastructural analysis after vitrification and <b>warming</b> <b>with</b> use of closed (CryoTip; Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA) or open (Cryotop; Kitazato BioPharma Co., Ltd., Shizuoka, Japan) devices. Setting: Pordenone Hospital IVF Unit and Medical Morphological Research Department, University of Udine. Patient(s) : Surplus oocytes from 10 patients (aged 31 - 39 years) undergoing assisted reproductive technologies at the Pathophysiology Unit of Human Reproduction and Sperm Bank between 2006 and 2008. Intervention(s) : Oocytes with normal invertoscopic appearance underwent vitrification and <b>warming</b> <b>with</b> closed (CryoTip) or open (Cryotop) devices and were processed for transmission electron microscopy. Main Outcome Measure(s) : Cryodamage extent and cell alterations in oocytes after open or closed vitrification and warming procedures and their rehydration rate. Result(s) : A {{higher rate of}} complete oocyte rehydration and less-severe ultrastructural alterations were observed after vitrification and <b>warming</b> <b>with</b> the open Cryotop device. Conclusion(s) : These preliminary data suggest that oocyte ultrastructure is better preserved with an open rather than closed vitrification and warming protocol...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{conducted}} a prospective, randomized trial of three methods of rewarming patients after hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass. Patients underwent either {{coronary artery bypass}} grafting or first-time valve replacement and were cooled to 32 º C during bypass. No significant differences existed among the groups as regards operative or preoperative parameters including hemodynamics and blood use. The patients actively <b>warmed</b> <b>with</b> a convective (Bair Hugger system, 3 hours) or a conductive blanket (electric overblanket, 4 hours) reached normothermia more quickly than those <b>warmed</b> <b>with</b> the space blanket (7 hours). This was reflected in significantly earlier extubation in the former two groups: Bair Hugger system 10. 8 ± 0. 6 hours, electric blanket 11. 3 ± 1. 0 hours, and space blanket 14. 8 ± 0. 8 hours. Patients <b>warmed</b> <b>with</b> the space blanket required a higher dosage of morphine over the first 12 hours than those <b>warmed</b> <b>with</b> the electric blanket (10. 4 vs 6. 5 mg; p = 0. 004), which may account {{for some of the}} differences between these two groups. No differences could be demonstrated between the two active blankets. On economic grounds we therefore recommend the reusable electric blanket for routine use.
