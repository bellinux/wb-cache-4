5|$|The Egyptian dog Abuwtiyuw, (IPA: ʔ-bwit-ʔew) also {{transcribed}} as Abutiu (extinct before 2280 BC), {{was one of}} {{the earliest}} documented domestic animals <b>whose</b> <b>name</b> is known. He {{is believed to have been}} a royal guard dog who lived in the Sixth Dynasty (2345–2181BC), and received an elaborate ceremonial burial in the Giza Necropolis at the behest of a pharaoh <b>whose</b> <b>name</b> is unknown.|$|E
5|$|At {{some time}} during the 590s, Rædwald married a woman <b>whose</b> <b>name</b> is unknown, though it is known from Bede that she was pagan. By her he fathered at least two sons, Rægenhere and Eorpwald. He also had an older son, Sigeberht, <b>whose</b> <b>name</b> is unlike other Wuffingas names but which {{is typical of the}} East Saxon dynasty. It has been {{suggested}} that Rædwald's queen had previously been married to a member of the Essex royal family and that Sigeberht was Rædwald's stepson, as was stated by William of Malmesbury in the 12th century. Sigeberht earned the enmity of his step-father, who drove him into exile in Gaul, possibly to protect the Wuffingas bloodline.|$|E

5|$|Likewise, {{occasionally}} {{an island}} may be {{named after a}} location on the nearby mainland, or a major neighbouring island - or vice versa. Examples of this include: Vementry, which was originally {{the name of an}} island, but <b>whose</b> <b>name</b> has been transferred to a nearby farm on Mainland Shetland; Oldany Island, <b>whose</b> <b>name</b> has been transferred to Oldany; Cramond Island which is named after neighbouring Cramond (a district of Edinburgh); and Eilean Mhealasta in the Outer Hebrides, which is named after Mealista on Lewis.|$|E

40|$|In five studies, {{we found}} that people like their names enough to un{{consciously}} pursue consciously avoided outcomes that resemble their names. Baseball players avoid strikeouts, but players <b>whose</b> <b>names</b> begin with the strikeout-signifying letter K strike out more than others (Study 1). All students want As, but students <b>whose</b> <b>names</b> begin with letters associated with poorer performance (C and D) achieve lower grade point averages (GPAs) than do students <b>whose</b> <b>names</b> begin with A and B (Study 2), especially if they like their initials (Study 3). Because lower GPAs lead to lesser graduate schools, students <b>whose</b> <b>names</b> begin with the letters C and D attend lower-ranked law schools than students <b>whose</b> <b>names</b> begin with A and B (Study 4). Finally, in an experimental study, we manipulated congruence between participants 2 ̆ 7 initials and the labels of prizes and found that participants solve fewer anagrams when a consolation prize shares their first initial than when it does not (Study 5). These findings provide striking evidence that unconsciously desiring negative name-resembling performance outcomes can insidiously undermine the more conscious pursuit of positive outcomes...|$|R

Hergé used his brother, Paul Remi, as the model for Sponsz, although he was also influenced by the image of the Austrian American filmmaker Erich von Stroheim.|$|E
5|$|Another small-bore cannon of the 14th {{century was}} the culverin, <b>whose</b> <b>name</b> derives from the snake-like handles {{attached}} to it. It was transitional between the handgun and the full cannon, and {{was used as an}} anti-personnel weapon. The culverin was forged of iron and fixed to a wooden stock, and usually placed on a rest for firing.|$|E

5|$|Isaac was {{the only}} patriarch who stayed in Canaan during his whole life and though once he tried to leave, God {{told him not to}} do so.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the name of the Qedarites is derived from the name for Ishamel's second son Qedar. Though the tribal name is Arabic, it was first transcribed in Assyrian (8th century BCE) and Aramaic (6th century BCE), as the Arabic alphabet had not yet been developed. In the Mareshah onomasticon, the Qedarites are listed as an ethnic group <b>whose</b> <b>name</b> in Aramaic transliteration is QDRYN.|$|E
