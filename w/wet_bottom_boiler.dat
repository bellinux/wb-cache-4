50|$|A Wet-bottom furnace or wet-bottom boiler is boiler that {{contains}} a wet bottom furnace. It {{is a kind of}} boiler used for pulverised fuel firing.In <b>wet</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>boiler</b> the bottom ash is kept in a molten state and tapped off as a liquid. <b>Wet</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>boiler</b> slag is the molten condition ash as it is drawn {{from the bottom of the}} slag-tap or cyclone furnaces.An advantage is the fact that the end product in this process has a higher value compared to that of a dry bottom boiler. Wet bottom boilers are preferred for low volatile coals that produce a lot of ash. But it has higher investment costs and higher maintenance costs, so it is built less often.|$|E
50|$|A {{portable}} {{steam engine}} and portable boiler on site {{are now the}} only such surviving examples recorded in the Gilberton locality. The wet bottom portable boiler is possibly of United States origin and is early and rare. It is the only <b>wet</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>boiler</b> recorded in North Queensland, and was probably used to power winding gear.|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{cost-effective}} method {{was applied for}} the synthesis of zeolite composites utilising <b>wet</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>boiler</b> slag from the Bulgarian coal-fired thermal power plant “Sviloza”, {{near the town of}} Svishtov. The method consisted of a prolonged alkali treatment at room temperature of this waste. Experimental techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray and X-ray diffraction analyses, are employed to characterize the initial slag and the final products with respect to their morphology, and elemental and mineral compositions. The composites synthesized in this way contained two Na-type zeolite phases: zeolite X (type FAU) and zeolite Linde F (type EDI). The zeolited products and the starting slag were tested as adsorbents for a textile dye (Malachite Green) from aqueous solutions. In comparison with the initial slag, the zeolite composite possessed substantially better adsorption properties: it almost completely adsorbs the dye in much shorter times. The results of this investigations revealed a new, easy and low cost route for recycling boiler slag into a material with good adsorption characteristics, which could find different applications, e. g., for purifying polluted waters, including those from the textile industry...|$|E
40|$|Microbeam Technologies Incorporated (MTI) {{is working}} with Prairie View to develop and {{demonstrate}} a new method to remove deposits from coal-fired utility boilers. MTI is providing background information on fuel properties, ash formation, ash deposition, and ash removal. In addition, MTI is providing deposits collected from a full scale utility boilers. Ash deposits on fireside heat exchange surfaces of power plants significantly decrease plant efficiency and are aggravated by variability in coal quality. Deposit formation is related to coal quality (chemical and physical characteristics of the inorganic material), system operating conditions, and system design. Variations in coal quality can significantly influence ash deposition on heat transfer surfaces resulting in decreased plant performance and availability. Ash accumulations on heat transfer surfaces require annual or semi-annual shutdowns for cleaning which result in cleaning costs and lost revenues from being off-line. In addition, maintaining slag flow in <b>wet</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>boilers</b> and cyclone-fired boilers can require co-firing of other fuels and outages to remove frozen slag resulting in decreased efficiency and availability. During this reporting period MTI performed analysis of deposits collected from full-scale utility boilers. Deposit samples were obtained from Basin Electric and from Northern States Power (NSP). The analyses were conducted using scanning electron microscopy/microprobe techniques {{as described in the}} past quarterly report. The chemical and physical properties of the deposits were determined. The results for sample collected from NSP`s Riverside plant are reported here...|$|R

50|$|The {{instrument}} used to prepare caffè at home, the caffettiera, {{is essentially a}} small steam machine made of a <b>bottom</b> <b>boiler,</b> a central filter which contains the coffee grounds, and an upper cup. In the traditional Moka, water is put in the boiler and the resulting boiling water passes through the coffee grounds, then reaches the cup. The Neapolitan caffettiera operates somewhat differently, {{and needs to be}} turned upside down when the drink is ready. Its boiler and cup are therefore interchangeable.|$|R

The dynamic behavior of the dry top layer and <b>wet</b> <b>bottom</b> layer thickness, as well as the bulk thickness, reflect the principal processes of the established drying mechanism. In addition, the results demonstrate stratification only when the drying process is in the evaporation controlled regime, whereas the coating is shown to remain a single layer for diffusion controlled drying.

50|$|Moist seedbeds are {{essential}} for high germination, and seedling survival depends on continuously favorable conditions during the first month. <b>Wet</b> <b>bottom</b> lands of rivers and major streams frequently provide such conditions, particularly where bare soil has been exposed or new soil laid down. Germination is epigeal. P. trichocarpa seedlings do not usually become established in abundance after logging unless special measures are taken to prepare the bare, moist seedbeds required for initial establishment. Where seedlings become established in great numbers, they thin out naturally by age five because the weaker seedlings of this shade-intolerant species are suppressed.|$|R
40|$|Influence of {{technology}} on colour changes of fly ashes was studied in {{relationships with their}} chemical and phase composition. Dry <b>bottom</b> <b>boilers</b> at the Detmarovice Power Plant (the Czech Republic) were selected for this study. Combustion tests were performed using mixture of coal and mineral oil residues at the minimum and maximum output of the power plant. Fly ashes for chemical analysis, phase analysis and colour measurements were sampled from the four sections of electrostatic fly ash precipitator. Colour parameters indicate relationships with concentrations of elements which are preferentially bound in silicate matrix. The maximum output of power plant increases the concentration of glass which has decisive influence on values of colour parameters. The changes of colour parameters can indicate {{the conditions of the}} technological process. Relationships between colour and constituents of the fly ash are expressed by CIE Lab colour parameters...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} mineral {{sequestration}} {{of carbon dioxide}} in circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC) <b>boiler</b> <b>bottom</b> ash. CFBC bottom ash, which originated from two sources, was prepared along with pulverized coal-fired (PC) <b>boiler</b> <b>bottom</b> ash as a control. These ashes were exposed to accelerated carbonation conditions at a relative humidity of 40 % and 100 %, in order to investigate the effects of humidity on the carbonation kinetics of the bottom ash. The obtained results showed that not only lime but other calcium-bearing phases (gehlenite, wollastonite, and brownmillerite) in CFBC bottom ash participated in the mineral carbonation reaction. In particular, these phases underwent hydration in a wet carbonation environment, whereby the carbon dioxide uptake and capacity of CFBC bottom ash are significantly enhanced. This study may have important implications, demonstrating the feasibility of carbon dioxide sequestration and recycling of CFBC <b>boiler</b> <b>bottom</b> ash...|$|R

50|$|Apart {{from the}} obvious hazards of {{collisions}} and mechanical breakdowns {{common to all}} vehicles, operating or riding a PWC can involve a risk of orifice injuries. These injuries are typical {{of the kinds of}} injuries that waterskiers experience as a result of falling into the water at speed. Such injuries can occur from simply falling in the water at speed or they can occur from the output end of the pump jet. A rider who falls (or is ejected) off the back can land directly {{in the path of the}} PWC's high-pressure jet of water. Unless a rider is appropriately dressed in garments made out of a strong, thick substance like neoprene (as is commonly found in wetsuits), the jet may penetrate any orifice it reaches. All major PWC manufacturers warn about this risk and recommend that passengers wear <b>wet</b> suit <b>bottoms</b> or equivalent protection.

2500|$|Fly ash, {{also known}} as [...] "pulverised fuel ash" [...] in the United Kingdom, is a coal {{combustion}} product composed of fine particles that are driven out of the boiler with the flue gases.
