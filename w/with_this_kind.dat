25|$|African iron overload, {{formerly}} known as Bantu siderosis, was first observed among people of African descent in Southern Africa. Originally, this was blamed on ungalvanised barrels used to store home-made beer, which led to increased oxidation and increased iron levels in the beer. Further investigation has shown that only some people drinking this sort of beer get an iron overload syndrome, and that a similar syndrome occurred in people of African descent who have had no contact <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of beer (e.g., African Americans). This led investigators {{to the discovery of}} a gene polymorphism in the gene for ferroportin which predisposes some people of African descent to iron overload.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} romanization {{standards}} for writing Urdu with the Latin alphabet, {{though they are}} not very popular because most fall short of representing the Urdu language properly.

The problem <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of romanization {{is that it can}} only be read by native speakers, and even for them with great difficulty. Among standardized romanization schemes, the most accurate is ALA-LC romanization, which is also supported by National Language Authority. Other romanization schemes are often rejected because either they are unable to represent sounds in Urdu properly, or they often do not take regard of Urdu orthography, and favor pronunciation over orthography.|$|E

25|$|When McNamara {{took over}} the Pentagon in 1961, the United States {{military}} relied on an all-out nuclear strike {{to respond to a}} Soviet attack of any kind. This kind of strike would lead to the death of Soviet military forces and also civilians. This was the same nuclear strategy planned by the Strategic Air Command (SAC), led by General Curtis LeMay. McNamara did not agree <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of action. He sought for other options after seeing how this strategy could not guarantee the destruction of all Soviet nuclear weapons leaving the United States vulnerable to retaliation. McNamara’s alternative in the doctrine of counterforce was to try to limit the United States nuclear exchange by targeting only enemy military forces. This concept would be used to prevent retaliation and escalation by holding Soviet cities hostage to a follow up strike. McNamara later concluded that counterforce was not likely to control escalation but likely to provoke retaliation. The U.S. nuclear policy remained the same.|$|E
25|$|The term matrix-assisted laser {{desorption}} ionization (MALDI) {{was coined}} in 1985 by Franz Hillenkamp, Michael Karas and their colleagues. These {{researchers found that}} the amino acid alanine could be ionized more easily if it was mixed with the amino acid tryptophan and irradiated with a pulsed 266nm laser. The tryptophan was absorbing the laser energy and helping to ionize the non-absorbing alanine. Peptides up to the 2843 Da peptide melittin could be ionized when mixed <b>with</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of “matrix”. The breakthrough for large molecule laser desorption ionization came in 1987 when Koichi Tanaka of Shimadzu Corporation and his co-workers used {{what they called the}} “ultra fine metal plus liquid matrix method” that combined 30nm cobalt particles in glycerol with a 337nm nitrogen laser for ionization. Using this laser and matrix combination, Tanaka was able to ionize biomolecules as large as the 34,472 Da protein carboxypeptidase-A. Tanaka received one-quarter of the 2002 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for demonstrating that, with the proper combination of laser wavelength and matrix, a protein can be ionized. Karas and Hillenkamp were subsequently able to ionize the 67 kDa protein albumin using a nicotinic acid matrix and a 266nm laser. Further improvements were realized {{through the use of a}} 355nm laser and the cinnamic acid derivatives ferulic acid, caffeic acid and sinapinic acid as the matrix. The availability of small and relatively inexpensive nitrogen lasers operating at 337nm wavelength and the first commercial instruments introduced in the early 1990s brought MALDI to an increasing number of researchers. Today, mostly organic matrices are used for MALDI mass spectrometry.|$|E
25|$|Proliferation resistance. In 2016, Nobel Laureate {{physicist}} Dr Carlo Rubbia, former Director General of CERN, {{claimed a}} {{primary reason for}} the United States cutting thorium reactor research in the 1970s {{is what makes it}} so attractive today: thorium is difficult to turn into a nuclear weapon.The LFTR resists diversion of its fuel to nuclear weapons in four ways: first, the thorium-232 breeds by converting first to protactinium-233, which then decays to uranium-233. If the protactinium remains in the reactor, small amounts of U-232 are also produced. U-232 has a decay chain product (thallium-208) that emits powerful, dangerous gamma rays. These are not a problem inside a reactor, but in a bomb, they complicate bomb manufacture, harm electronics and reveal the bomb's location. The second proliferation resistant feature {{comes from the fact that}} LFTRs produce very little plutonium, around 15kg per gigawatt-year of electricity (this is the output of a single large reactor over a year). This plutonium is also mostly Pu-238, which makes it unsuitable for fission bomb building, due to the high heat and spontaneous neutrons emitted. The third track, a LFTR doesn't make much spare fuel. It produces at most 9% more fuel than it burns each year, and it's even easier to design a reactor that makes only 1% more fuel. <b>With</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> of reactor, building bombs quickly will take power plants out of operation, and this is an easy indication of national intentions. And finally, use of thorium can reduce and eventually eliminate the need to enrich uranium. Uranium enrichment is one of the two primary methods by which states have obtained bomb making materials.|$|E
