Port Republic Road in the city of Harrisonburg and SR 659 in Rockingham County from the city to US 340 were {{transferred}} from the secondary system to the primary highway system as SR 253 by a resolution passed by the Commonwealth Transportation Board on March 17, 2005. The transfer <b>was</b> <b>supported</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> by the planned relocation of Rockingham Memorial Hospital from north of the James Madison University campus in the city to southeast of the city in Rockingham County, a process that began in 2004 and was completed when the hospital opened in 2010. SR 253 was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from SR 704 (Boyers Road) north to the city limit, thus connecting with the four-lane highway built {{by the city}}, starting in early 2010. The expansion project was completed in early 2012, although the new divided highway opened to traffic in June 2011. The project included construction of a small piece of SR 280a highway planned as the Southeast Connector that is intended to connect SR 42, US 11, SR 253, and US 33 south of Harrisonburgat its intersection with SR 253 next to Rockingham Memorial Hospital.|$|E

25|$|In the sport's early days, {{football}} {{was very much}} focused on attack and, as such, many teams (e.g. Royal Engineers, 1872) played with a 1–2–7 formation (one defender, two mid-fielders and seven attackers). The single defender {{was known as the}} three-quarter-back, and he <b>was</b> <b>supported</b> <b>in</b> <b>part</b> by two half-backs from mid-field who would be in charge of orchestrating the game with short passing. Up front, the seven forwards were split into four wing forwards and three centre forwards. The wingers' main task was to use their pace to pick up on the long balls sent forward by the half- and three-quarter-backs, whereas the centre forwards were charged with taking the short passes from the half-backs.|$|E
