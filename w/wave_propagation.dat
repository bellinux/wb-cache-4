5|$|The Euro-Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) website, {{one of the}} top global {{earthquake}} information website {{experienced a}} massive and immediate traffic surge caused by the convergence of eyewitnesses looking for information about the shaking. Their hit times proved to mimic the seismic <b>wave</b> <b>propagation</b> generated by the earthquake. On average eyewitnesses hit the website 90s after the ground start shaking. The epicenter was determined with 30km by retropagating 2 min of EMSC website traffic without using any seismic data. The authors argue that eyewitnesses can be considered as real time sensor, their website visit being triggerred by the ground shaking.|$|E

Initially, the equations describing a stress state of the track elements have differential components for the time and dynamic loading accounting. However, for the majority of problems solving, they are significantly simplified – the difficult dependences are replaced with the empirical coefficients, some parameters are simply neglected.
