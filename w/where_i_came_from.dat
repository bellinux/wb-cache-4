2500|$|Boxing {{has been}} a part of Mayweather's life since his {{childhood}} and he never seriously considered any other profession. [...] "I think my grandmother saw my potential first," [...] he said. [...] "When I was young, I told her, 'I think I should get a job.' She said, 'No, just keep boxing.'" [...] During the 1980s, Mayweather lived in the Hiram Square neighborhood of New Brunswick, New Jersey, where his mother had relatives. He later said, [...] "When I was about eight or nine, I lived in New Jersey with my mother and we were seven deep in one bedroom and sometimes we didn't have electricity. When people see what I have now, they have no idea of <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> and how I didn't have anything growing up." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1940, Lomax and {{his close}} friend Nicholas Ray {{went on to}} write and produce a fifteen-minute program, Back <b>Where</b> <b>I</b> <b>Came</b> <b>From,</b> which aired {{three nights a week}} on CBS and {{featured}} folk tales, proverbs, prose, and sermons, as well as songs, organized thematically. Its racially integrated cast included Burl Ives, Lead Belly, Josh White, Sonny Terry, and Brownie McGhee. In February 1941, Lomax spoke and gave a demonstration of his program along with talks by Nelson A. Rockefeller from the Pan American Union, {{and the president of the}} American Museum of Natural History, at a global conference in Mexico of a thousand broadcasters CBS had sponsored to launch its worldwide programming initiative. Mrs. Roosevelt invited Lomax to Hyde Park. But despite its success and high visibility, Back Where I Come From never picked up a commercial sponsor. The show ran for only twenty-one weeks before it was suddenly canceled in February, 1941. On hearing the news Woody Guthrie wrote Lomax from California, [...] "Too honest again, I suppose? Maybe not purty enough. O well, this country's a getting to where it can't hear its own voice. Someday the deal will change." [...] Lomax himself wrote that in all his work he had tried to capture [...] "the seemingly incoherent diversity of American folk song as an expression of its democratic, inter-racial, international character, as a function of its inchoate and turbulent many-sided development.|$|E
2500|$|The mixtape is {{predominantly}} R/pop; however, JoJo describes the mixtape's sound as genre-less. On the first {{track of the}} tape [...] "Back2thebeginningagain" [...] JoJo talks about her constant record label struggles and how she finally feels okay to record the type of music she has always wanted to. JoJo states [...] "It's about driving around Foxborough in my mom's Toyota Echo with the dents {{on the side of}} it and just getting in touch with my roots: Who I am; <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>from.</b> I'm talking about some of those dark times where I've drank until I've gone to sleep and woken up and feeling like 'ok, everything else is in the past. Today I start forward and start fresh.'" [...] The mixtape's second track [...] "We Get By" [...] is mainly of an old school R/pop genre. It is written by JoJo who expresses remaining optimistic in spite of the obstacles she faces. [...] "I know it will be OK. I believe in myself" [...] she sings, referring to her constant label troubles. JoJo states [...] "It's kind of about me moving from South Boston to Los Angeles and my decision to do that. Feeling like I needed a place to explore and grow." [...] She goes on further in another interview stating [...] "It's the mission statement for {{what we were going to}} expand upon, and I was touching on the feeling like you don't belong anywhere but you still feel like you're going to be okay no matter where you're at." [...] The third track on the tape [...] "Take the Canyon" [...] is influenced by an old relationship. JoJo says [...] "'Take the Canyon' is about cheating, and it's about only having a window of time to be with that lover and needing to get there as soon as possible for this illicit rendezvous. It's about taking the canyonâ€“Beverly Glen or Laurel Canyon or whatever it may be." [...] The fourth track is titled [...] "Billions" [...] and was originally written about an old lover. JoJo states [...] "it became about my family. As much as I can see in the world, there's nothing more important to me than that foundation of family, friendship and real love." ...|$|E

60|$|Brown {{asked me}} <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>from,</b> what my plans were, and I replied with eager confidence. Then we grew harmoniously {{enthusiastic}} over Herbert Spencer and Darwin and Mantegazza and I talked a stream. My long silence found vent. Words poured {{from me in}} a torrent but he listened smilingly, his big head cocked on one side, waiting patiently for me to blow off steam. Later, when given a chance, he showed me the manuscript of a book upon which he was at work and together we discussed its main thesis. He asked me my opinion of this passage and that--and I replied, not as a pupil but as an equal, and the author seemed pleased at my candor.|$|E
60|$|He {{then began}} to {{question}} me cunningly, <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>from,</b> whether I was rich, whether I could change a five-shilling piece for him (which he declared he had that moment in his sporran), {{and all the time}} he kept edging up to me and I avoiding him. We were now upon a sort of green cattle-track which crossed the hills towards Torosay, and we kept changing sides upon that like dancers in a reel. I had so plainly the upper hand that my spirits rose, and indeed I took a pleasure in this game of blindman's-buff; but the catechist grew angrier and angrier, and at last began to swear in Gaelic and to strike for my legs with his staff.|$|E
60|$|Anger sprang in my heart, and I turned {{straight}} {{about and}} walked at a stiff pace to <b>where</b> <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>from.</b> The path lay {{close by the}} bushes where I had remarked the head. The cover came to the wayside, and as I passed I was all strung up to meet and to resist an onfall. No such thing befell, I went by unmeddled with; and at that fear increased upon me. It was still day indeed, but the place exceeding solitary. If my haunters had let slip that fair occasion I could but judge they aimed at something more than David Balfour. The lives of Alan and James weighed upon my spirit {{with the weight of}} two grown bullocks.|$|E
