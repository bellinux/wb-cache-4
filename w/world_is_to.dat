5|$|Players can journey between field screen {{locations}} via {{the world}} map, a downsized representation of Final Fantasy Legends various worlds. Players can freely navigate {{around the world}} map screen unless restricted by terrain, such as water or mountains. The goal in each <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> find {{the entrance to the}} next level of the Tower. Random enemy encounters occasionally interrupt travel across the world map screen and hostile areas, as in other Final Fantasy related games.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{composed}} of six worlds with three levels each, totalling to 18 main levels. The objective of the main levels in each <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> collect four jet pods. Each final level of a world consists of a boss fight. The level designs vary from snow-capped mountains to carnivals. While most of the levels are large, outdoor excursions, two are enclosed within a narrow interior. The game features hidden bonus levels, which are triggered when secret entrances are found. Bonus levels consist of blocks with balloons in them; popping the balloons yields either coins or power-ups. A time attack mode is available for any level the player has completed.|$|E
25|$|It is {{even more}} tragic that other world leaders who witness {{repression}} pretend it is not happening, or is exaggerated. When history eventually deals with the dictators, those who stood by and watched should also bear the consequences.

After that, Lilith arrives and destroys the vampire race along with the five of the Council of 6. Under Kalutika's influence, she moves to kill him but he is saved by the Elder Vampire, who teleports them to safety.

Mirza Ghulam Ahmad appeared as the promised Messiah at the sixth epoch heralding the seventh and final age of mankind, as a day in the estimation of God is like a thousand years of man's reckoning. According to Ghulam Ahmad, just as the sixth day of the week is reserved for Jumu'ah (congregational prayers), likewise his age is destined for a global assembling of mankind in which the <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> unite under one universal religion: Islam.|$|E

As Conduits are immune, White claims that the only way Cole can save the <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> turn his back on humanity. After locating the last core, Cole prepares to activate the RFI.

60|$|Firmness, I may observe, was {{the grand}} quality on which both Mr. and Miss Murdstone took their stand.
