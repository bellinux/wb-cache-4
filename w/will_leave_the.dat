5|$|When {{a cluster}} of stars is formed {{at about the same}} time, the life span of these stars will depend on their {{individual}} masses. The most massive stars <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> main sequence first, followed steadily in sequence by stars of ever lower masses. Thus the stars will evolve in order of their position on the main sequence, proceeding from the most massive at the left toward the right of the HR diagram. The current position where stars in this cluster are leaving the main sequence is known as the turn-off point. By knowing the main sequence lifespan of stars at this point, it becomes possible to estimate the age of the cluster.|$|E
5|$|Born {{helpless}} {{and unable to}} move around (nidicolous and semi-altricial), the chicks are constantly brooded by the parents until they are 3 to 5 days old, when they can thermoregulate their body temperature. They grow their first feathers—scapulars—at 13–15 days, followed by primaries at 24–27 days, tail feathers at 30–35 days and are fully feathered by 55 days. They are attended by the parents more between the 30th and 60th days; a behavior possibly related to the greater food requirements of the chicks during those days. Semi-digested food is regurgitated and then fed to younger birds, with older birds being fed solid food. The parents {{can be seen at}} normal rates with the chicks up to about the 70th day, after which the attendance by the parents falls rapidly. Chicks receive no care after fledging, with only about one out of seven chicks receiving food after the 80th day, and almost no chicks are visited after about 90 days. After fledging, the chicks <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> nest, with few remaining after about 100 days.|$|E
5|$|In 1883, Krakatoa begins {{stirring}} for {{the first}} time in 200 years. In the nearby village of Waringin, Sadidjah confides to her husband, village head Tjakra Amidjaja, that she has had a bad dream about the volcano; she fears that it will be the death of them. Tjakra Amidjaja consoles her, and tells her that they <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> village in two days. In the meantime, the volcano grows increasingly violent and Tjakra Amidjaja and Sadidjah stay behind to manage the evacuation. They send their children, Hasan and Soerijati, to stay with family in Rangkas Gombong. Krakatoa erupts several hours later. The village is wiped out in the resulting tsunami, and Soerijati is lost after she falls out of the carriage she is in; Hasan, however, arrives safely in Rangkas Gombong.|$|E

50|$|The {{solution}} can be {{seen with}} an inductive argument. If k = 1 (that is, there is exactly one blue-eyed person), the person will recognize that they alone have blue eyes (by seeing only green eyes in <b>the</b> others) and <b>leave</b> at <b>the</b> first dawn. If k = 2, no one <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> at <b>the</b> first dawn. The two blue-eyed people, seeing only one person with blue eyes, {{and that no one}} left on the 1st dawn (and thus that k > 1), <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> on <b>the</b> second dawn. Inductively, it can be reasoned that no one <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> at <b>the</b> first k − 1 dawns if and only if there are at least k blue-eyed people. Those with blue eyes, seeing k − 1 blue-eyed people among the others and knowing there must be at least k, will reason that they must have blue eyes and leave.|$|R
25|$|There {{are many}} factors {{affecting}} whether worker wasps <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> nest. Important considerations include temperature, light intensity, {{and the existence}} of other wasps. Relative humidity and atmospheric pressure do not affect V. rufas decision of whether or not to leave the nest. Orientation flights occur so that V. rufa can familiarize themselves with the entrance to their nest and recognize it when they return. By removing roadblocks, V. rufa would be able to enter and exit more smoothly.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Raven informs Officer Ed Price (Lawson), {{the head}} of the police department, that he wants Tom to meet him alone.

25|$|A {{new star}} will {{sit at a}} {{specific}} point on the main sequence of the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, with the main-sequence spectral type depending upon {{the mass of the}} star. Small, relatively cold, low-mass red dwarfs fuse hydrogen slowly and will remain on the main sequence for hundreds of billions of years or longer, whereas massive, hot O-type stars <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> main sequence after just a few million years. A mid-sized yellow dwarf star, like the Sun, will remain on the main sequence for about 10 billion years. The Sun is thought {{to be in the middle}} of its main sequence lifespan.|$|E

25|$|The hen lays {{a clutch}} of 8–16 white eggs, usually in a tree hole or hollow, which are {{incubated}} for 35 days. The sitting hen <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> nest once a day from 20 minutes to {{one and a half}} hours, and will then defecate, drink water, eat and sometimes bathe. Once the eggs begin to hatch it may take 24 hours for all the chicks to break through their shells. When feral chicks are born they usually stay with their mother for about 10–12 weeks. Their bodies cannot produce all the heat they need, especially in temperate regions, so they will stay close to the mother especially at night.|$|E
25|$|When {{the queen}} has {{completed}} her job of producing daughter queen larvae, she dies, leaving {{a crop of}} virgin queens which <b>will</b> <b>leave</b> <b>the</b> nest, mate, hibernate and reproduce in the following spring. After the queen's death, the coordination of the colony breaks down and the workers begin to lay eggs. The rate and amount of foraging decrease drastically after the queen's death so it is unable to support all the workers and their brood. This is when cannibalism occurs among the workers and furthermore, the workers tear off their cells and carry {{them out of the}} nest, dropping the temperature of the entire nest. Once this stage is reached, the remaining workers die of cold or starvation.|$|E
