500|$|Debate over Trescothick's {{place in}} the England squad {{continued}} amid an end-of-series reshuffle in the England batting lineup. This included the dropping of fellow opener Strauss from the one-day side, {{and the rise of}} Alastair Cook as a Test and ODI opener for England. Trescothick stated that he would see how he progresses before committing to the international scene: [...] "Of course I'd love to play for England again.... Clearly, if I want to continue my career I have to undertake another tour. But for now, if and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> back to full fitness and I think I am OK and ready to play, I'll make myself available for England." [...] He added that he was [...] "desperate to play for England again" [...] but was waiting until he was [...] "as convinced as I can be that I am ready to take on the challenge of international cricket".|$|E
500|$|The episode {{attempted}} to bring closure to {{several aspects of}} the series. In one sequence, Alex Krycek throws The Smoking Man {{down a flight of}} stairs, presumably to his death. Nicholas Lea, the actor who portrayed Krycek, noted: [...] "That's one of the character's great moments, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> to push Bill Davis down a set of stairs. In a sense, he has nothing to lose because his life's burned out. So death doesn't have the same terror that it would to a young happy chap." [...] The episode also featured several tender moments between Mulder and Scully, which many fans found [...] "nearly pornographic {{in the context of their}} long, chaste courtship", according to Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles in their book The Complete X-Files. Gillian Anderson, however, defended the moments, arguing that there was ample amount of romance between Mulder and Scully prior to [...] "Requiem".|$|E

500|$|Potter was an unsentimental naturalist {{who thought}} no {{creature}} either good or bad, {{and had no}} qualms describing earwigs in Mrs. Tittlemouse's passage or woodlice in her pantry. Her publisher Harold Warne however had different ideas about what was appropriate for a children's book. He had become accustomed to Potter's unusual choice of animal subjects through the years, but, ever sensitive to public reaction, thought she had gone a bit too far in Mrs. Tittlemouse with the earwig and the woodlice. [...] The earwig was, at his behest, transmogrified into a beetle and the woodlice into [...] "creepy-crawly people" [...] hiding in Mrs. Tittlemouse's plate rack. [...] "I can alter the text, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> the proofs," [...] she wrote, [...] "and will erase the offensive word 'wood-lice'!" [...] Potter argued for the generic term [...] "slaters" [...] for the woodlice, but was overruled. It was decided that an illustration of a centipede (Miss Maggie Manylegs) would be withdrawn and replaced with a butterfly.|$|E

Although disappointed with the results, Sigurður expressed confidence that [...] "I will get a younger and a bigger and better one soon."

When asked about the lyrical content of the song, Lohan revealed, [...] "A lot of people go through family issues, abuse {{and that kind of}} thing.

500|$|Shortly {{before his}} {{deployment}} to Europe, the Kilmers' daughter Rose had died, and twelve days later, their son Christopher was born. [...] Before his departure, Kilmer had contracted with publishers {{to write a}} book about the war, deciding upon the title Here and There with the Fighting Sixty-Ninth. The regiment arrived in France in November 1917, and Kilmer wrote to his wife that he had not written [...] "anything in prose or verse since I got here—except statistics—but I've stored up a lot of memories to turn into copy <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> a chance." [...] Kilmer did not write such a book; however, toward the end of the year, he did find time to write prose sketches and poetry. [...] The most notable of his poems during this period was [...] "Rouge Bouquet" [...] (1918) which commemorated the deaths of two dozen members of his regiment in a German artillery barrage on American trench positions in the Rouge Bouquet forest north-east of the French village of Baccarat. [...] At the time, this was a relatively quiet sector of the front, but the first battalion was struck by a German heavy artillery bombardment on the afternoon of March 7, 1918 that buried 21 men of the unit, killing 19 (of which 14 remained entombed).|$|E
500|$|The episode {{featured}} {{an ensemble}} {{of family and}} friends of Gwen and Rhys previously unseen in the series. William Thomas and Sharon Morgan were cast as Gwen's parents Geraint and Mary Cooper. Davies re-introduced the characters during the fourth series of the show, considering Thomas and Morgan to be [...] "two fine Welsh actors". Thomas had previously appeared as two different characters in the 1988 Doctor Who serial Remembrance of the Daleks and the 2005 Doctor Who episode [...] "Boom Town". Upon appearing in [...] "Something Borrowed" [...] he became the first actor to have appeared in all three of the classic series, new series and Torchwood. Nerys Hughes played Rhys' mother Brenda Williams, in addition to a duplicate form of the alien Nostrovite. Like Thomas she had previously appeared in a Doctor Who serial (the 1982 story Kinda). Hughes enjoyed getting to play a [...] "monster" [...] {{for the first time in}} her career which involved having [...] "fangs and claws and red eyes" [...] and being wired up so [...] "all this black blood can ooze out <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> shot". Despite the funny aspect of the script Hughes took the role seriously stating that [...] "everyone plays it for real" [...] and that [...] "you can't camp it up".

500|$|At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Spears said to MTV News {{that she}} had thought of a [...] "really cool concept for the video, just to make it interesting. You'll have to see."

She told him the basic story she had planned, which he described as a [...] "fairy-tale, sweet, knight-in-shining-armor feel to it. I said let's take that and make the fairy tale badass." [...] Spears also wanted her real-life boyfriend Jason Trawick to play the criminal. Marrs Piliero was initially hesitant to cast Trawick feeling that a professional actor would do a better job, but did not talk to Spears about it. He told USA Today, [...] "When you're doing nudity, I don't think {{it was at the}} top of Britney's list to bring in some random guy while her boyfriend watches. [...] We definitely wanted to make some passionate, steamy scenes, but we also wanted it to be intensely beautiful. We didn't want to go for raunchy. We wanted it to be sensual and steamy." [...] On September 6, 2011, Spears announced through her Twitter account {{that she had}} decided to shoot the video [...] "in the streets of merry old England <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> there." [...] In an interview with AOL, she explained, [...] "I've never shot on location out of the country of America for a video. So, it should be very interesting.

500|$|Hank Williams, {{who heard}} both the Miller and Griffin versions, started {{performing}} the {{song on the}} Louisiana Hayride shortly after joining in August 1948. Horace Logan, the show's producer and programming director for KWKH, reported that the audience [...] "went crazy" [...] the first time Williams performed the song on the show. [...] In light of the live audience's strong positive reaction, Williams decided to record the song. His decision was questioned by his musicians and also his producer, Fred Rose, who felt that the song did not merit a recording. Williams, mindful of the reaction he received live, [...] persisted, and the recording {{took place during the}} final half-hour of a session recorded at Herzog Studio in Cincinnati, Ohio, on December 22, 1948. For this recording, Williams replaced the jazz musicians with a modern country music band, using a rhythm guitar, mandolin, string bass, drums and a steel guitar. [...] Williams' session band was composed of Clyde Baum (mandolin), Zeke Turner (electric guitar), Jerry Byrd (steel guitar), Louis Innis (rhythm guitar), Tommy Jackson (fiddle) and Willie Thawl (bass). With little time left, Byrd and Turner replicated the musical arrangement they previously used on an Ernest Tubb session for a cover of Jimmie Rodgers' [...] "Waiting for a Train". [...] In the episode of American Masters about Williams, Drifting Cowboy Don Helms recalls, [...] "When they recorded 'Lovesick Blues,' Fred told Hank, 'That song's out of meter! [...] Got too many bars in it. [...] And you hold that note too long.' [...] And Hank said, 'Well, when I find a note I like, I wanna hold on to it as long as I can,' you know, just tryin' to be funny. [...] And Fred said, 'Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. [...] That thing is so much out of meter, I'm gonna get me {{a cup of coffee and}} <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> back maybe ya'll have that thing cut.' [...] And they did, but it was still out of meter. [...] So Fred lived with that the rest of his life." [...] Williams combined Griffin's lyrical arrangement with a two-beat honky-tonk track, borrowing the yodeling and beat drops from Miller's recording. [...] "Lovesick Blues" [...] was recorded in two takes.|$|E
500|$|In 1958 Terry-Thomas {{received}} {{the first of}} his two film award nominations, the BAFTA Award for the [...] "Best British Actor in 1959" [...] for the part of Ivan in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer film tom thumb. He later described the film as his second favourite; he appeared opposite Sellers for much of his screen time, and later said that [...] "my part was perfect, but Peter's was bloody awful. He wasn't difficult about it, but he knew it". Terry-Thomas was still suffering with poor health following the filming of The Naked Truth when he suffered an attack of lumbago; filming went on for 85days during 1957–58, and he took painkillers to enable him to continue. The role was physically demanding, and required him to ride a horse, run long distances and fight in a duel. He stated that he fought and ran [...] "just as [...] had seen Douglas Fairbanks Snr do in The Mark of Zorro". Towards the end of filming, Terry-Thomas went to a Christmas party at the Trocadero, where he drank champagne, as well as taking codeine tablets, and was subsequently arrested on suspicion of being drunk and disorderly. He considered the arresting policemen to have been rude, and [...] "their attitude made me extremely angry and <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> angry... I just go completely off my nut". The case came to court on 14 March 1958 and his legal team from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer provided a medical report which showed Terry-Thomas had been on a course of prescription painkillers due to a gruelling filming schedule; along with inconsistencies in the arresting policemen's notes, the case proved inconclusive and was dismissed. For {{much of the rest of}} 1958, Terry-Thomas appeared on stage at the London Palladium in Large as Life, alongside Harry Secombe, Eric Sykes and Hattie Jacques. He played one of the Three Musketeers in one sketch and had another turn called [...] "Filling the Gap"; the show ran for a total of 380performances between May and December 1958. He also released his first record, Strictly T-T, a collection of comic songs and sketches.|$|E

500|$|The {{third floor}} {{contains}} the Grand Ballroom, the Silver Corridor, the Basildon Room, the Jade Room and the Astor Gallery. Numerous organizations hold their annual dinners {{in the grand}} ballroom of the Waldorf, including St. John's University President's Dinner, the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York's annual gala, during which the Deus Caritas Est Award for philanthropy is presented, and the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner. The NASCAR Sprint Cup end-of-season awards banquet {{was held at the}} Waldorf-Astoria every year between 1981 and 2008 before moving to the Wynn in Las Vegas. It was held initially in the Starlight Room, but from 1985, it was staged in the Grand Ballroom, except in 2001 and 2002. On May 1, 2004, the Waldorf-Astoria was the venue for the Manhattan Hungarian Network Grand Europe Ball, a historic black-tie charitable affair co-chaired by Archduke Georg of Austria-Hungary which celebrated the Enlargement of the European Union. Bob Hope was such a regular performer at the Ballroom that he said, [...] "I've played so many dinners in the Grand Ballroom, I always make a crack <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>get</b> up to speak that I leave my dinner jacket in the lobby so that I don't have to ship it to the Coast all the time". Of note in the Astor Gallery are 12 allegorical females, painted by Edward Emerson Simmons. Every October the Paris Ball was held in the Grand Ballroom, before moving to the Americana (now the Sheraton Center). It hosted a memorable New Year's Eve party with Guy Lombardo and the Royal Canadians, and Lombardo used to broadcast live on the radio there from the [...] "Starlight Roof". Maurice Chevalier performed at the ballroom in 1965 in his last appearance. The Silver Corridor outside the ballroom bears a resemblance to the Peacock Alley, but is shorter and wider. The fourth floor has the banquet and sales offices, and many of the suites including Barron, Vanderbilt, Windsor, Conrad, Vertès, Louis XVI and Cole Porter, named after the celebrities who stayed in them. The fourth floor was where the notorious Sunday night card games were played. There is also a re-creation of one of the living rooms of Hoover's Waldorf-Astoria suite in the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum.|$|E
