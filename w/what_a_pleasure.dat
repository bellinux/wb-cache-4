5|$|The choreography for {{the ballet}} was {{elaborated}} by the ballerina's father, Filippo Taglioni. The audience's prurient delight in this scandalous scene is well conveyed by the reviewer for the Revue des Deux-Mondes: A crowd of mute shades glides through the arches. All these women cast off their nuns' costume, they {{shake off the}} cold powder of the grave; suddenly they throw themselves into the delights of their past life; they dance like bacchantes, they play like lords, they drink like sappers. <b>What</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> to see these light women... The set for the ballet was an innovative and striking design by Henri Duponchel and Pierre-Luc-Charles Ciceri. Duponchel had also introduced technical innovations for the staging, including 'English traps' for the sudden appearance and disappearance of the ghosts. (Meyerbeer was led to complain that the spectacle was too much and was pushing his music into the background). Taglioni danced the Abbess only six times in Paris; she was replaced by Louise Fitzjames, (who danced the role 232 times).|$|E

They remained friends, but Empson recalled one clash: [...] "At that time the Government had put into action a scheme for keeping up the birth-rate during the war by making it in various ways convenient to have babies, for mothers going out to work; government nurseries were available after the first month, I think, and there were extra eggs and other goodies on the rations. My wife and I took advantage of this plan to have two children. I was saying to George one evening after dinner <b>what</b> <b>a</b> <b>pleasure</b> it was to cooperate with so enlightened a plan when, to my horror, I saw the familiar look of settled loathing come over his face. Rich swine boasting over our privileges, that was what we had become ...".|$|E

As he did so, it came into his mind that it must be these little appliances had fixed the language so that it was still clear and understandable after two hundred years. The haphazard cylinders he substituted displayed a musical fantasia. At first it was beautiful, and then it was sensuous. He presently recognised what appeared to him to be an altered version of the story of Tannhauser. The music was unfamiliar. But the rendering was realistic, and with a contemporary unfamiliarity. Tannhauser did not go to a Venusberg, but to <b>a</b> <b>Pleasure</b> City. <b>What</b> was <b>a</b> <b>Pleasure</b> City? <b>A</b> dream, surely, the fancy of a fantastic, voluptuous writer.|$|R

50|$|Idora Park was a 17.5 acre Victorian era trolley park {{in north}} Oakland, California {{constructed}} in 1904 {{on the site}} of an informal park setting called Ayala Park on the north banks of Temescal Creek.

Popularity of the park declined after the advent of the automobile, and in 1929, Idora Park was razed.|$|R
50|$|This is a {{piece about}} something, and someone, who is great, about <b>what</b> <b>a</b> {{profound}} <b>pleasure</b> it is to encounter greatness, and about <b>what</b> <b>a</b> persistent concern {{it is that we}} live in a culture, more specifically a dance culture, that resists such greatness.Nearly every scene strikes the heart: Eddie's disruption of a brilliantly choreographed six-clown routine; his caustic hostility to gays; Eddie and Dave looking down on a lawn at two women dancers prancing on the green; Dave giving a sexual come-on to an imaginary woman in a pub; Dave verbally harassed by a man with a video camera, followed by a swaying fantasy dance, echoed by the other dancers; Rowan's first encounters with the hula-hooper (Kareena Oates), and their growing romance, all done with silence and hoops; Dave's fluid floor-dance with a woman in a dance studio; and the astonishing final scene, with Eddie and Dave on the beach, speculating about moving to New York and making it on the club circuit.|$|R
