The {{construction industry}} accounts for a third of the country's total waste. And today a normal project sends about 10 % of waste to landfill, but how should a project proceed in order to achieve zero landfill? The purpose of this thesis is to highlight the opportunities that exist in waste management in the construction of new buildings and how to prevent landfill. The goal is to summarize the results in a checklist to serve future projects. The study consists of a literature review in order to determine the current state of knowledge in landfill. Interviews with leading persons at two of Skanska's successful reference projects were held in order to capture their opinions and thoughts on zero landfill, and the factors that made their projects succesful. Interviews were also held with waste contractors from two of Sweden's major waste companies, in order to get a different angle on the landfill issue. The result shows that the issue of zero landfill is very complex and there are many factors involved.

In addition, it may potentially be applied to other defense waste streams such as sodium bearing tank waste or calcine. Joule-heated melters (already in service at SRS) will initially be used at the Hanford Site's Waste Treatment and Immobilization Plant (WTP) to vitrify tank waste fractions. The glass waste content and melt/production rates at WTP are limited by the current melter technology. Significant reductions in glass volumes and mission life are only possible with advancements in melter technology coupled with new glass formulations. The Next Generation Melter (NGM) program has been established by the U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE's), Environmental Management Office of Waste Processing (EM- 31) to develop melters with greater production capacity (absolute glass throughput rate) {{and the ability to}} process melts with higher waste fractions.

40|$|This {{case study}} investigates {{domestic}} waste recycling schemes in the Cape Peninsula with special reference to educational aspects {{as a basis}} for developing educational resource materials. It explores the question: "In what way can projects for the recycling of domestic waste serve as a vehicle for environmental education?". The study employs the concept of education for the environment, following a socially critical approach with action-oriented and participatory dimensions. The research sample constituted interviewees and/or workshop participants from fourteen different municipalities, six recycling industries, one private <b>waste</b> <b>contractor</b> and the three most prominent voluntary organisations involved in recycling in the Cape Peninsula. A small-scale -interview survey was done to review existing recycling initiatives, combined with a case study of several small participatory initiatives towards educational resource development. The results were analysed qualitatively. The case study indicates that recycling initiatives have excellent potential for education for the environment. This potential was partially explored in this research by addressing key issues such as the role of local authorities in recycling of domestic waste, the short-term perspectives {{on the part of the}} local authorities, as well as the importance of and constraints on participation in recycling projects and in the research. Other issues discussed include the educational implications of personal (economic) benefits of recycling, the social development dimension of some recycling projects, the value of school children organising recycling projects, limited teacher participation in existing recycling projects, and the need for environmental education resource material. The major value of the project lies however in critical reflection on the research process. Recommendations regarding participatory resource development as an approach to socially critical environmental education are put forward to inform similar studies in the future and to elucidate the approach. Recommendations regarding the recycling of domestic waste in the Cape Peninsula are also made. ...|$|E

The study aims to establish role of stakeholder {{power in the}} prioritisation process and add to empirical understanding of the way engagement affect accountability, which evaluates both the `process', and the `outcome' of engagement. This research {{is based on a}} three mini cases of local government authorities, which involve in-depth interviews, observations and document analysis. A broader insights of the engagement process from several stakeholder groups, namely the residents, NGOs, councillors and private waste contractors, are considered and compared with managerial views, and several aspects of stakeholder engagement practices are analysed, including the mechanisms used as well as the challenges faced by the LGAs in engaging. In addition, the intentions behind engagement undertakings are analysed and evaluation of the effectiveness of stakeholder engagement practices are made. Drawing on stakeholder theory, the role of power is explored as a stakeholder attribute in determining salience and in the engagement process. Insights from the interviewees are analysed in relation to the extent of participation and perceived level of power held which are then used to map the extent of their involvement on the ladder of engagement. The findings indicate that power does {{play an important role in}} the engagement process. Managers also give greater consideration to those demonstrating certain extent of power i. e. the private <b>waste</b> <b>contractor</b> and councillors. It has also been proved that managers' perceptions of the levels of power held by stakeholders play a significant role in establishing their priorities and deciding between competing interests. The use of stakeholder engagement as a mechanism for accountability has led to the recognition of a deficiency underlying the many processes of engagement. The study also has identified an additional feature of accountability, namely the interactive nature of engagement, which is unrecognised in other established measures of accountability.

The various actors in solid waste management are identified {{as well as the}} roles they play. The study also explores Public Private Partnership as a tool in managing solid waste and the outcome of strategies used in managing solid waste in the Municipality. This is followed by a discussion on the challenges faced in solid waste management that prevents the strategies used in managing solid waste from achieving the desired objectives. The study focuses on household production of solid waste {{in view of the fact}} that majority of solid waste generated in the municipality is from households. This study uses Norman Long’s actor-oriented approach to identify the various actors in order to better appreciate their roles in solid waste management leading to social change. A combination of quantitative and qualitative method is used with questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and observation deplored to gain a deeper understanding of solid waste management in this municipality. A total of 82 respondents participated in the survey with a response rate of 82 % and 14 informants who were made up of 9 key informants and 5 primary informants with a response rate of 78 %. This study has shown that apart from the key actors in solid waste management, there are other actors who play various important roles that are not recognised. It has also revealed that most of the problems of solid waste which were supposed to be cured by strategies put in place to manage solid waste still exist and waste contractors are only able to collect 60 % of total solid waste generated daily resulting in heaps of refuse lying in gutters, communal sites, households and other public places; a situation that may have serious health outcome for residents. One interesting finding is the fact that many households do not have problems paying for house-to-house solid waste services but are not satisfied with the level of service rendered by <b>waste</b> <b>contractor</b> due to irregularity in service provision. Also the study discovers a new set of actors in solid waste management in the municipality who operate with tricycles providing services to households for a fee. The study has also shown that many of the problems of solid waste that still exist is the joint creation of the actors themselves through their actions as well as the challenges they face and by addressing these challenges, these problems may reduce drastically and the municipality will be rid of filth...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the area}} of construction and demolition waste (C & D W) auditing. The production of C&DW has grown year after year since the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) first published a report in 1996 which provided data for C&D W quantities for 1995 (EPA, 1996 a). The most recent report produced by the EPA is based on data for 2005 (EPA, 2006). This report estimated that the quantity of C&DW produced for that period to be 14 931 486 tonnes. However, this is a ‘data update’ report containing an update on certain waste statistics so any total provided {{would not be a}} true reflection of the waste produced for that period. This illustrates that a more construction site-specific form of data is required. The Department of Building and Civil Engineering in the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology have carried out two recent research projects (Grimes, 2005; Kelly, 2006) in this area, which have produced waste production indicators based on site-specific data. This involved the design and testing of an original auditing tool based on visual characterisation and the application of conversion factors. One of the main recommendations of these studies was to compare this visual characterisation approach with a photogrammetric sorting methodology. This study investigates the application of photogrammetric sorting on a residential construction site in the Galway region. A visual characterisation study is also carried out on the same project to compare the two methodologies and assess the practical application in a construction site environment. Data collected from the <b>waste</b> management <b>contractor</b> on site was also used to provide further evaluation. From this, a set of waste production indicators for new residential construction was produced: □ 50. 8 kg/m 2 for new residential construction using data provided by the visual characterisation method and the Landfill Levy conversion factors. □ 43 kg/m 2 for new residential construction using data provided by the photogrammetric sorting method and the Landfill Levy conversion factors. □ 23. 8 kg/m 2 for new residential construction using data provided by <b>Waste</b> Management <b>Contractor</b> (WMC).

Twenty three experts experienced in commercial refurbishment projects and three <b>waste</b> <b>contractors</b> with specific knowledge of construction waste were interviewed. Waste receipts for an ongoing case study project were monitored. Three major factors were found to inhibit recycling rates: the presence of any form of asbestos in the building; the continued occupation of the building during construction; and the breaking up of a large project into small separate contracts for different stages of the refurbishment so that there were no economies of scale for the contractor who wanted to recycle.

40|$|The Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) rich oil-states {{including}} the United Arab Emirates are countries in transition. These countries have become wealthy {{in recent years}} through the sale of oil and gas. They have radically changed from tribal lifestyles to become modem societies {{within a short time}} frame. The UAE has changed rapidly to become a wealthy modern state within a generation (less than 25 years). The oil revenues have flowed into the UAE starting from the federation of the country, which was in 1971, although oil was discovered in the 1950 s in Abu Dhabi Emirate, the largest and wealthiest state in the country in terms of oil and gas resources. Modern medicine and healthcare facilities have recently arrived in the GCC countries; their health services have improved dramatically. As a consequence much more medicallhealthcare waste is being generated. Thus, the concept of medicallhealthcare waste, as well as the concern with such type of waste, have become new issues for these countries. This research focuses on healthcare/medical waste management in the GCC countries, taking the UAE as a case study. As these countries have changed dramatically and become wealthy very recently and rapidly, there has been no comprehensive or accurate literature or research on waste management systems in these countries and none related to medical waste management. Record keeping in hospitals/healthcare facilities or at waste facilities are not necessarily of a good standard {{because of the lack of}} monitoring and enforcement. Therefore, reports by government authorities or consultancy companies are neither comprehensive nor precise. An extensive field work inspection was conducted in hospitals and other healthcare facilities as well as to waste facilities, including <b>waste</b> <b>contractors</b> 2 ̆ 7 facilities and waste dumpsite in Abu Dhabi Emirate, to explore the problems and failures in the management of medicallhealthcare waste that currently exist. Furthermore, a survey was conducted to a wide range of healthcare and waste facilities 2 ̆ 7 workers to identify their knowledge, skills, attitudes and training regarding the handling practices and the management of medicallhealthcare waste. The inspections and surveys revealed that the problem is a managerial one not a technical one. State-of-the-art technology is affordable and can be purchased from any where in the world to be used for the treatment and management of medicallhealthcare waste. But as these societies have been changed from a tribal form to industrialized modern ones in a short time frame, they have not had the opportunity to develop management systems that go hand in hand with any modem technology that would be obtained; for example, training skilled personnel to deal with the rapidly changing situation. Consequently, these countries have to rely on immigrant personnel whom are brought from low cost countries. Various ranges of slulled, semi-skilled, and unskilled workers come to the UAE, and other GCC countries, to work in hospitals and elsewhere. The professional or skilled personnel who are brought to work in healthcare facilities have knowledge of hazardous-healthcare waste. But this is not the case with the poorly skilled or unskilled workers who work as waste handlers either in hospitals/healthcare facilities, <b>waste</b> <b>contractors</b> 2 ̆ 7 facilities, or waste dumpsite. They have neither knowledge nor have the skills to handle hazardous waste. Moreover, the survey results reveal that both types of workers (i. e. skilled and unskilled) were not specifically trained to have the skills for handling such waste. They even do not have the awareness on most issues related to the medicalkealthcare waste treatment and management practices in Abu Dhabi emirate. As this research will illustrate these workers need training. A best management practice model for medicallhealthcare waste has been discovered in the Queensland experience, Australia. This has been taken as a yardstick to be followed in Abu Dhabi Emirate and the other Emirates and GCC countries. An environmental management system, based on both the Queensland model and the literature has been developed for hospitalslhealthcare facilities, <b>waste</b> <b>contractors</b> and <b>waste</b> dumpsite in Abu Dhabi. Once the lack of waste management knowledge was identified through the survey, it became apparent that a novel and fundamental feature of the environmental management system was training.

40|$|Purpose - This paper aims {{to analyse}} the factors {{influencing}} refurbishment site managers' waste management efforts. Design/methodology/approach - Twenty-seven semi-structured interviews were held with managers from two large contractors involved in housing and office refurbishment projects in Sweden. Also, a web and postal questionnaire survey {{was sent to}} 232 refurbishment site managers and received a 34 per cent response rate. Findings - Site managers devise waste management strategies based on environmental inventories and project size. In smaller projects, <b>waste</b> <b>contractors</b> are employed only for physical activities rather than providing advice. Site managers' waste management efforts are influenced by project-related factors, organizational and personal factors, technical factors, industry culture and legislation. The level of contract detail, specific client demands related to waste management and project size are important factors. Practical implications - Policies and guidelines for projects of different sizes should be developed at least for large contractors; scale influences site managers' waste strategies. Waste management efforts in refurbishment projects can be improved by addressing simple technical problems including providing clear labelling of containers and ensuring shelter fromrain and snow. Originality/value - This is a pioneer survey of refurbishment site manager opinions and practices. Inefficient waste management in building refurbishment projects can be costly and harmful to the environment. There are many opportunities to improve waste management efforts...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a rise in {{environmental}} consciousness and community awareness of waste disposal issues. However, discrepancies remain between people’s attitude and their behavior regarding waste disposal and recycling; commonly known as the “attitude behavior gap”. This study was designed to aid in bridging this gap by exploring how signage, incorporating psychological principles and effective sign design, can encourage people to correctly dispose of their unwanted materials. The utilization of festivals, mass gatherings and events as spaces to test the impact of pro-environmental messaging on behavior is an emerging field of research. This study investigated the role of signage in aiding attendees of the world music festival WOMADelaide to correctly dispose of their unwanted materials. To complement and support the three-bin system utilized by the <b>waste</b> <b>contractors</b> for the event, four signs were developed and tested in the catering area. These signs included a baseline sign, as well as three motivational signs containing graphics and messages, based on different theoretical positions or psychological principles. The results gained from analyzing the concealed camera footage indicated that the bins under the three motivational signs elicited a greater number of deposits. However, the waste was no better sorted than those located under the baseline sign. The findings of this study support previous research into the “attitude behavior gap” and highlight areas for future research into signage in a festival setting...|$|R

40|$|This study {{looks at}} the {{implementation}} and financing of solid waste management in the Philippines. It assesses {{how much it costs}} forty-one local government units (LGUs) around the country to provide solid waste management services. It also looks at how much revenue these LGUs, and other private <b>waste</b> <b>contractors</b> and operatives, get from supplying these services. The study was carried out in response to a growing solid waste management crisis in the Philippines and legislation that requires LGUs to change their practices. Its main aim was to get information to help LGUs properly finance and implement the government's latest waste management policies and law. The study finds that there is generally a substantial "fiscal gap" between the amount of money needed for waste management and the amount of revenue obtained by LGUs from providing waste management services. However, when the total economic benefits of providing these services were considered (these included the revenues obtained by LGUs, earnings made by other parties and savings from avoided landfill costs), it was found that some LGUs enjoyed positive net benefits. If LGUs could exploit as many potential revenue streams as possible, they could narrow their SWM fiscal gap or even go 'into the black'. The study highlights a number of possible strategies {{that could be used to}} improve the financing of solid waste management. These included finding alternatives to expensive private contractors and looking into recycling as a revenue-generating activity. Solid waste management, Philippines...|$|R
40|$|Waste {{management}} in refurbishment projects {{can be costly}} and harmful to the environment. Legislation on waste management sets limits, but the construction industry remains among the top contributors to waste generation. Well planned waste management can drive improvements in productivity and environmental sustainability. Site managers’ waste management strategies might include reducing waste generation, reuse, recycling and disposal. The aim is to analyse the administrative and physical factors influencing refurbishment site managers’ attitudes and behaviours towards waste management. Eight semi-structured interviews were held with site managers, two with project managers and two with environmental staff belonging to large contractors involved in housing and office refurbishment projects in Sweden. Waste management practices on refurbishment sites were found to differ. Influences on site managers arise at three organisational levels: top management (sustainability policies), local level (project budgets), and site level (physical factors including limited space). Disposal of waste is the last choice of most site managers given cost and company policies. Site managers devise waste management strategies based on environmental inventories and project size. In smaller projects, <b>waste</b> <b>contractors</b> are employed only for physical support and site managers have less flexibility due to limited physical space. Design-build procurement is viewed by site managers as more efficient for waste management; partnering is promoted for greener refurbishment projects. Client demand and company policy heavily influence practices. Unlike new construction, refurbishment clients seldom require green waste management {{to a higher standard}} than is typical of large contractors...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{rapid changes}} in markets {{including}} outsourcing and {{globalisation of trade}} and production systems {{have led to a}} dramatic upsurge of interest in retail logistics with the aim to minimise operational and logistics costs, improve responsiveness and ameliorate customer services. The notable massification and commodification of production and consumption have created structural changes in traditional urban distribution systems with the establishment of peripheral transshipment and hub systems. In the light of sustainable development, green logistics and transparency on emissions have become a further requirement conforming to the times with a special focus being placed on the logistics of collecting, processing and recycling waste materials. This has increased the need to develop more efficient and effective city distribution plans and to establish optimised logistics models which will integrate the delivery of materials and the collection of waste and returns in order to reduce congestion, costs and emissions. To this end, this thesis aims to investigate opportunities to improve existing delivery mechanisms in a dedicated shopping centre in the UK in order to minimise freight activity and emissions, while optimising the reverse flow system for product returns and waste. Using a substantial database of logistics operations compiled for 92 businesses in Southampton’s shopping centre, the study aimed to understand the current opportunities to better utilise the existing back-load capacity and assess the potential logistical and environmental savings that could arise from the use of a peripheral consolidation centre for core goods and waste. Following statistical analysis on WestQuay managers, logistics providers, <b>waste</b> <b>contractors</b> and head offices responses {{it was found that the}} fill rates of delivery vehicles were considerably low and therefore there was a great potential to increase back-load rates and consolidation among loads of different businesses. In examining the waste and return flows it was found that there were already centrally managed collections of general waste and some recyclables and therefore further opportunities to reduce the logistics and environmental impact would lie into the consolidation of forward traffic and the back-loading of specific waste streams such as hazardous materials. The examination however of specific case study examples exhibited the variety in the characteristics and properties of hazardous wastes and the role of material-specific legislation on the way different waste streams should be managed and disposed of which limited the collaboration opportunities among businesses producing different waste streams. Instead the study highlighted the considerable transport, environmental and economic gains that could be achieved by individual businesses through the use of regional <b>waste</b> <b>contractors</b> and recycling sites. With regard to the consolidation of forward flows, the study reviewed a number of existing consolidation schemes and their characteristics to identify potential strengths, weaknesses and risks that would impact on the operation of a consolidation centre in the outskirts of Southampton. Various scenarios regarding the operation of the consolidation scheme were examined considering different take up combinations among different vehicle modes and loads. The scenario analysis suggested that the establishment of the consolidation centre could offer great opportunities to reduce the overall urban freight activity, while mitigating the environmental impacts and cutting down the total costs to businesses...|$|R
