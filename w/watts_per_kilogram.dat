2500|$|Grasshoppers {{are known}} to use elastic energy storage to {{increase}} jumping distance. As noted above, power output is a principal determinant of jump distance, but physiological constraints limit muscle power to approximately 375 <b>Watts</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> of muscle. To overcome this limitation, grasshoppers anchor their legs via an internal [...] "catch mechanism" [...] while their muscles stretch an elastic apodeme (similar to a vertebrate tendon). When the catch is released, the apodeme rapidly releases its energy. Because the apodeme releases energy more quickly than muscle, its power output exceeds that of the muscle that produced the energy.|$|E
2500|$|Nanoconcrete {{is created}} by high-energy mixing (HEM) of cement, sand and water. To ensure the mixing is {{thorough}} enough to create nano-concrete, the mixer must apply a total mixing power to the mixture of 30 - 600 <b>watts</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> of the mix. [...] This mixing must continue long enough to yield a net specific energy expended upon the mix of at least 5000 joules per kilogram of the mix. A plasticizer or a superplasticizer is then added to the activated mixture which can later be mixed with aggregates in a conventional concrete mixer. In the HEM process, the intense mixing of cement and water with sand provides dissipation of energy and increases shear stresses {{on the surface of}} cement particles. This intense mixing serves to divide the cement particles into extremely fine nanometer scale sizes, which provides for extremely thorough mixing. [...] This results in the increased volume of water interacting with cement and acceleration of Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) colloid creation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Previously, {{preliminary}} {{results of our}} researches showed that, mobile phone radiofrequency radiation does not affect human serum in an in vitro immunoenzymometric assay. However, we stated that the results should be confirmed in a larger series and employing different exposure doses on a specific hormone. Considering this statement, {{the aim of this}} study was to investigate whether the exposure from a 900 MHz cell phone can affect the thyroid Triiodothronine (T 3) levels in human serum. In addition, a review of the recent patents in radiation and immunoenzymometric assays is also presented. Human serum samples from 63 healthy donors were placed into two groups, and the well heads in the first group were exposed to 900 MHz exposure emitted from a GSM mobile phone (Nokia, Model 1202, India) with 1. 09 <b>Watt</b> <b>per</b> <b>kilogram</b> (W/kg) of the tissue locally in the head specific absorption rate for 30 minute. Unexposed group was served as the control sample under identical conditions and was compared with the exposed one in quantitative determination of T 3 using the Wilcoxon test with criterion level of P = 0. 050. There was no significant difference in serum T 3 in the exposed group compared to the control group (P > 0. 05). According to this study, mobile phone radiation at frequency of 900 MHz does not affect human T 3 hormone in an in vitro immunoassay under the conditions used.
