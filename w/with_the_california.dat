5|$|Isolated and {{difficult}} to reach, the monument initially attracted few visitors, by 1920 only 1,800 for the year. The situation changed markedly when large numbers of Americans began to travel by automobile on roads paid for largely with government funds. One highway connected Grants Pass <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>California</b> coast at Crescent City. Another new road, the Oregon Caves Highway, led from the Grants Pass – Crescent City highway to the cave. Campaigns to attract car-driving tourists included those of the Cavemen, a booster group from Grants Pass that dressed in animal skins, posed along tour routes, and staged annual events to promote the monument. By 1928, {{the number of visitors}} to the cave had risen to about 24,000 a year.|$|E

5|$|Proposals for electrifying {{the line}} began {{as early as}} 1992, when the California Department of Transportation {{conducted}} an early feasibility study. For two decades, the project lay dormant {{due to lack of}} funding until Caltrain agreed to share its tracks <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>California</b> High-Speed Rail Authority (CHSRA), which was looking for a route for the constitutionally-mandated San Jose—San Francisco segment. The Authority agreed to partially fund the electrification project in exchange for rights to share the track. Construction contracts for electrification were awarded on July 2016 and groundbreaking was expected to occur in March 2017, but was delayed when the new United States Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao indefinitely deferred federal funding just before construction was about to begin. That same month, Caltrain removed the contractor responsible for implementing PTC for failure to perform on-budget and on-schedule. On May 2017, the Federal Transit Administration’s (FTA) announced its intention to sign the grant and reversed Secretary Chao's deferment. Construction formally began two months later.|$|E
