40|$|Data sources {{over the}} Web publish their query {{interfaces}} through forms or templates. Over time, {{the set of}} templates supported by a source changes due to new requirements or enhanced query-processing capabilities. When a new template is being considered for a source, {{it is important to}} verify whether the new template is redundant with respect to the existing set of templates being supported. This verification avoids redundant templates and keeps the query interfaces simple. In this paper, we study the problem of verifying if a given template is redundant with respect to a given set of templates. We develop efficient algorithms to solve the problem. 1 Introduction Web data sources with limited query capabilities abound. Sources typically publish their query capabilities through forms. Users pose queries to data sources by filling out the forms and submitting them to the sources. For instance, the <b>Web</b> <b>bookstore</b> Amazon. com provides a query form that allows users to search for books by sp [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Heterogeneity and {{interoperability}} of Web {{data sources}} represent the current key issue in Web information extraction and integration. Warehouse approach and virtual approach are the common approaches adopted to integrate heterogeneous Web data sources. However, few analytic model and cost model {{were developed to}} measure and assess the efficiency and effectiveness of either approach or a combination. Hence, a contingency model cannot be produced to assist the search engine to select and mix the warehouse method and the virtual method. In this study, we present a genetic algorithm assisted hybrid approach to aid the search engine to evaluate the cost and performance factors. We apply genetic algorithm technique to formulate a cost optimization model and compute and compare the cost of extraction and integration. The cost model {{is based on a}} collection and compilation of the property data of the query analysis and path expression of the involved Web data sources. Six property analyses are conducted and six evolution steps are created to formulate the genetic algorithm of optimization. Further, we conduct a preliminary experiment using 15 local and global <b>Web</b> <b>bookstores</b> to install and test th...|$|R
40|$|Recently in Japan, {{while many}} <b>web</b> <b>bookstores</b> are doing brisk business, many actual bookstores are {{suffering}} from depressed book sales and searching for ways to survive the tough economic times. Identifying the model of a desira-ble bookstore {{from the point of}} view of users is one way of helping bookstores to improve their services. In this paper we use two methods, the evaluation grid method (EGM) and the think aloud method (TAM), to identify the factors undergraduate students use to evaluate bookstores. EGM is based on the repertory grid method developed by A. G. Kelly, and modified by Junichiro Sanui. We opted to use both methods because they supplement each other. We collected 179 pictures of bookstores using Google image search, from which we selected 20 pictures using ran-dom sampling. We showed these pictures to seven undergraduate students, and had them evaluate the pictures. Using EGM, we collected 63 evaluation items and identified the evaluation structure for bookstores. Using TAM, we identified 14 categories of evaluation. We compared the data we obtained using the two methods, and analyzed the students ‟ image of a desirable bookstore. We concluded that bookstores are evaluated according to factors that ca...|$|R

40|$|Current search {{technologies}} work in "one size fits all" fashion. Therefore, {{the answer}} to a query is independent of specific user information need. In this paper, we describe a novel ranking technique for personalized search services that combines content-based and community-based evidences. The community-based information is used in order to provide context for queries and is influenced by the current interaction of the user with the service. Our algorithm is evaluated using data derived from an actual service available on the <b>Web,</b> an online <b>bookstore.</b> We show that the quality of content-based ranking strategies can be improved by the use of community information as another evidential source of relevance. In our experiments, the improvements reach up to 48 % in terms of average precision...|$|R
3000|$|The {{evaluation}} process {{was designed as}} follows: The {{participants were asked to}} sign a Non-Disclosure form by adding their emails in an on-line form. The acceptance of the terms was redirecting the users to the evaluation page where the evaluation was described through the completion of a five steps process. 1.Complete the demographics data questionnaire, 2.Download and open the prototype, 3. Perform a given task with the prototype, 4. Answer a post-test questionnaire and 5. Send the screen capturing video to us. The evaluation request was given to Computer Science and Computer Engineering students of the Computer Science Department of University of Cyprus and the Computer Engineering and Informatics of the University of Patras. Additionally, Computer Engineering researchers of the Institute of Information Technology (ITI/CERTH) in Greece have also participated. From the total of 28 responses were received, 23 (83.9 %) were from men and 5 (17.1 %) were from women. The task that {{the participants were asked to}} perform was “to design the high level diagram for a <b>web</b> based electronic <b>bookstore</b> showing the CRUD operations of the system using the MVC architecture and definition of the most suitable Design Patterns at the three architectural layers”. The evaluation is still open and accessible at the url: [URL] [...]...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT DEVELOPMENT OF AN E-COMMERCE WEB APPLICATION USING. NET TECHNOLOGY by Gurinder Jit Singh Master of Science in Computer Science California State University, Chico Summer 2009 The {{information}} revolution came in {{the early}} 1990 s {{with the advent of}} the World Wide Web. In the early days of the web, the use of websites was very limited. With the passage of time, new technologies were developed which provided unlimited convenience to the internet users in performing day to day tasks. One of the areas that evolved significantly with the commercialization of e-commerce applications was the way companies did business. Big and small companies moved towards exploring new techniques of doing business, and created e-commerce websites for selling their products and services online. The web applications developed in the early years of the web posed many problems that made the user experience cumbersome and complicated. Some of other problems faced by the website users were the weak security methodology, inaccessibility for the disabled, tedious coding methodology, and lack of administrative features. To improve on the flaws that existed in earlier websites, Microsoft introduced a new technology called. NET which included many new enhancements and features that were missing from the older technologies, such as providing advance security through encryption, built-in control for faster website development, server-side scripting, and compiled execution for better performance. Also, the seamless integration of the e-commerce websites developed using. NET with web services further simplified and expanded the ways in which such e-commerce websites interoperated with other businesses. This project demonstrates the new features present in the Microsoft???s. NET technology and also emphasizes the importance of web services in the development of e-commerce websites. This is shown by developing an e-commerce <b>bookstore</b> <b>web</b> application in which payments are processed by using PayPal???s all-in-one payment processing service. This bookstore application provides its users with advanced security features, easy website accessibility and navigation, built-in controls for rapid development, reporting services, and web analytic solution for accurately measuring web statistics. A conclusion is presented showing how this bookstore application can be extended in functionality to reach more customers and for enhanced user experience. CSU, Chic...|$|R
