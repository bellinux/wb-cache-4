This paper {{building}} upon studies [1 ‚Äê 8] {{describes a}} subset of the High Pressure Water (HPW) descaling strategy developed at Tata Steel UK to optimise descaling set-ups for range of steel grades prone to adherent primary scale such as in high alloy steels (Si, Ni, Cr). Effective primary descaling, i. e. descaling post furnace discharge via <b>washbox</b> or alternative technologies is imperative to obtain good surface quality and conditioning of the surface state as well as the morphology, growth and behaviour of the secondary/tertiary scale. This paper primarily focuses on analytical descaling concepts for both mechanical and thermal outputs for flat jet nozzle and process factors. This approach has been linked to recent developments for oxide scale evolution during rolling and descaling [8]...|$|E
