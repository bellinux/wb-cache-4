Another says that a dry biscuit and a glass of water is all that his brain will stand. One lunches on the white of an egg. Another eats merely the yolk.

There is a little line, like a hair, entirely around it. Now that line has become a crack. Now you can see it, I know. It grows wider and wider! Look! The shell of the egg is separating in the middle. The <b>whole</b> <b>egg</b> slightly moves. Do you notice that? Now you can see something yellow showing itself between the two parts of the shell. See! It is moving a good deal, and the two halves of the shell are separating more and more. And now out tumbles this queer little object. Do you see what it is? It is a poor, weak, little chick, not able to stand, but alive--alive! You can all perceive that it is alive. Now you can see that it is standing on its feet, feebly enough, but still standing.|$|E
60|$|Considering {{the vicissitudes}} and disappointments {{of their life}} together, it was {{remarkable}} how certain they remained that they would at last cross the bar and reach the harbour of comfortable circumstance. They had, one may suppose, expectations in their blood. The germ of getting 'something for nothing' had infected their systems, so that, though they were not selfish or greedy people, and well knew how to rough it, they dreamed so {{of what they had}} not, that they continually got rid of what they had in order to obtain more of it. If for example Ralph received an order, he felt so strongly that this was the chance of his life if properly grasped, that he would almost {{as a matter of course}} increase and complicate the project till it became unworkable, or in his zeal omit some vital calculation such as a rise in the price of bricks; nor would anyone be more surprised than he at this, or more certain that all connected with the matter had been 'fat choughs' except--himself. On such occasions Eileen would get angry, but if anyone suggested that Ralph had overreached himself, she would get still angrier. She was very loyal, and fortunately rather flyaway both in mind and body; before long she always joined him in his feeling that the whole transaction had been just the usual 'skin-game' on the part of Providence to keep them out of their expectations. It was the same in domestic life. If Ralph had to eat a breakfast, which would be almost every morning, he had so many and such imaginative ways of getting from it a better breakfast than was in it, that he often remained on the edge of it, as it were. He had special methods of cooking, so as to extract from everything a more than ordinary flavour, and these took all the time that he would have to eat the results in. Coffee he would make with a <b>whole</b> <b>egg,</b> shell and all, stirred in; it had to be left on the hob for an incomparable time, and he would start to catch his train with his first cup in his hand; Eileen would have to run after him and take it away. They were, in fact, rather like a kitten which knows it has a tail, and will fly round and round all day with the expectation of catching that desirable appendage. Sometimes indeed, by sheer perseverance, of which he had a great deal in a roundabout way, Ralph would achieve something, but, when this happened, something else, not foreseen by him, had always happened first, which rendered that accomplishment nugatory and left it expensive on his hands. Nevertheless they retained their faith that some day they would get ahead of Providence and come into their own.|$|E

40|$|A {{wide range}} of radiolabeled test meals {{have been used for}} gas-tric {{emptying}} scintigraphy. The {{purpose of this study was}} to test whether 99 mTc-sulfur colloid 2 labeled liquid egg white is as sta-ble as 2 fresh <b>whole</b> <b>eggs</b> labeled with 99 mTc-sulfur colloid and whether the cooking method is important. Methods: <b>Whole</b> <b>eggs</b> and liquid egg white were mixed with 99 mTc-sulfur colloid and cooked by either microwaving or frying on a griddle. The cooked eggs were tested for breakdown after 2 and 4 h of incu-bation in gastric fluid or HCl. Results: Labeled liquid egg white, prepared by either method of cooking, exhibited less breakdown in gastric fluid thanwhole <b>eggs.</b> <b>Whole</b> <b>eggs</b> cooked in themicro-wave exhibited significantly more breakdown than liquid egg white. Conclusion: 99 mTc-Sulfur colloid binds better to eggwhites compared with <b>whole</b> <b>eggs.</b> These results emphasize the need to evaluate the stability of new radiolabeled test meal preparations, including the method of cooking.

40|$|The limited {{availability}} of alternative foods to replace natural prey hinders cost-effective mass production of ladybird beetles for augmentative biological control. We compared {{the effects of}} powdered vs. whole Artemia franciscana (A. franciscana) (brine shrimp) eggs {{with or without a}} dietary supplement on development and reproduction of Coleomegilla maculata (C. maculata) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae). We tested the hypotheses that (1) powdered A. franciscana eggs are more suitable than whole eggs; and (2) palmitic acid, a common fatty acid in natural prey, i. e., aphids, is an effective dietary supplement. Development time, pre-imaginal survival, sex ratio, and body weight of adults did not differ significantly amongst individuals fed powdered vs. <b>whole</b> <b>eggs,</b> with or without 5 % palmitic acid. Significantly more oviposition occurred when females were fed powdered <b>eggs</b> than <b>whole</b> <b>eggs</b> and powdered eggs with 5 % palmitic acid than <b>whole</b> <b>eggs</b> with or without 5 % palmitic acid. A weak functional relationship was found between pre-oviposition time and total oviposition by females fed powdered eggs with 5 % palmitic acid; pre-oviposition time decreased as oviposition increased. Food treatments had no significant differential effect on progeny (egg) hatch rate. In conclusion, a simple change in A. franciscana egg texture and particle size (i. e., blending <b>whole</b> <b>eggs</b> into a dust-like powder) increases oviposition in C. maculata. Supplementing powdered eggs with 5 % palmitic acid might accelerate oogenesis (egg maturation) in some females...|$|R
