50|$|In 1979, {{the three}} friends, Segal, Sheila Rowbotham and Hilary Wainwright <b>wrote</b> <b>Beyond</b> the Fragments, arguing for broader alliances among trade unionists, feminists and left {{political}} groups. Its argument quickly won a large following {{leading to a}} major conference in Leeds, Yorkshire, in 1980 and a second edition in 1981. In 1984, publisher Ursula Owen invited her to join the Virago Advisory Board and write an appraisal {{of the state of}} feminism, resulting in her first book, Is the Future Female? Troubled Thoughts on Contemporary Feminism. This book reached a broad audience, with its questioning of gender mythologies, whether of women's intrinsic virtues, or men's inevitable rapaciousness, which had been appearing in the work of many popular feminist writers in the 1980s.|$|E

'Since then the obstacles facing us have grown formidably; deepening recession, environmental pollution, falling real wages and savage welfare cuts. 'New forms of resistance have appeared, but how are they to coalesce? In our three new essays in this new edition of Beyonds the Fragments we return to the fraught question of how to consolidate diverse upsurges of rebellion into effective, open democratic left coalitions. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the paper}} {{it is argued}} that Minsky's theory of {{financial}} fragility, interpreted as a the- ory of structural instability, is useful to interpret the current crisis. Structural instability means that a small event can change the qualitative characteristic of a system and thus even its dynamic properties. As Minsky <b>wrote,</b> <b>beyond</b> the uncertainty arising from ex- pected inflows and outflows what matters is the state of markets when people need to take positions in them. Before the financial crisis, though many agents were speculative and Ponzi ones, the extreme liquidity of the markets has allowed them to operate quietly for a long time. When the crisis exploded a tiny increase in the bankruptcy rate of mortgages caused the breakdown of the whole financial system. The qualitative change that followed in this case was the destruction of markets. Monetary policy had to use unusual tools in order to cope with this event. The Federal Reserve however has changed its operating procedures to overcome this problem to overcome this problem only late, as the financial crisis had already propagated to the real sector. Thus the paper concludes that the Federal Reserve did not perceive the potential danger for systemic stability of a huge unregulated short term money market and did not switch promptly enough to the new measures once the crisis started. ...|$|E
