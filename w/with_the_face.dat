Towards the belly, the feathers are a paler grey. The wings are grey-brown, and the blackish primaries have white edges which merge to form the prominent white wing markings.|$|E

5|$|Previous {{security}} {{features in the}} Ship Series were carried over to the Portrait Series, and new ones incorporated into the banknote. The two most prominent {{security features}} are the engraved portrait of Yusof bin Ishak (which contains fine lines that are difficult for counterfeiters to mimic) and the Kinegram (a printed security hologram); MAS states that banknotes with missing or mutilated portrait or/and Kinegram command no value. Paper versions issued by BCCS features its logo and the face value, while those issued by the MAS features its logo with the Merlion (a mythical creature and national symbol) and the face value. Polymer versions of the banknote have the Kinegram replaced by {{an image of the}} Singapore lion symbol <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> value, showing the coat of arms of Singapore when tilted at varying degrees.|$|E
5|$|Stela 21 {{is located}} inside the chamber {{at the top}} of StructureA-3. This stela was badly damaged when the vaulted chamber {{collapsed}} on top of it and has also suffered from erosion. The monument has been restored and depicts the lord of Seibal Wat'ul Chatel bearing a manikin sceptre. Like Stela8, the king wears attributes of the Bearded Jaguar God, although without the jaguar claws. The king holds a K'awiil sceptre raised in his right hand, from his other hand hands a shield <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of the sun god. The inscription on the monument is largely illegible.|$|E
5|$|Under Guatemalan law, Maya stelae {{and other}} archaeological {{artefacts}} are {{property of the}} Guatemalan government {{and may not be}} removed from the country without its permission. In the case of Machaquilá Stela2, the monument was well known before it was stolen and its illegal removal was easy to prove. The stela itself was cut into pieces, <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> being sawn off and moved to a fish packing factory in Belize, where it was packed into boxes and shipped to California. There it was seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation after being offered for sale to various institutions. The stolen portion of the stela was returned to Guatemala and is now in storage at the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City.|$|E

5|$|Stela 31 is the {{accession}} monument of Siyaj Chan K'awiil II, also bearing two {{portraits of}} his father, Yax Nuun Ayiin, {{as a youth}} dressed as a Teotihuacan warrior. He carries a spearthrower {{in one hand and}} bears a shield decorated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of Tlaloc, the Teotihuacan war god. In ancient times the sculpture was broken and the upper portion was moved to the summit of Temple 33 and ritually buried. Stela 31 has been described as the greatest Early Classic sculpture to survive at Tikal. A long hieroglyphic text is carved onto the back of the monument, the longest to survive from the Early Classic, which describes the arrival of Siyah K'ak' at El Peru and Tikal in January 378. It was also the first stela at Tikal to be carved on all four faces.|$|E
5|$|The {{rear face}} is plainer, with no jewels, but still highly decorated; Cherry speculates {{that it may}} {{originally}} {{have been much more}} simple and not designed for viewing, with most of the other elements added after it was originally made. At the top is a medallion <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of Christ set in a sunburst. The central round-topped area contains two doors, secured with a small gold pin, containing full-length gold figures in relief, chased in gold, a feature unique to this reliquary. On the left door is the archangel Saint Michael, spearing a dragon representing the devil. He was both the patron saint of the French monarchy, and also traditionally the person responsible for supervising the chaotic crowds at the Last Judgement, when he is often shown in art weighing souls in a pair of scales. On the right is Saint Christopher, carrying the Christ child on his shoulders, who raises his hand in blessing. There was a popular belief that sight of an image of Saint Christopher meant that a person would not die on that day without receiving the Last Rites, which may well explain his presence here.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{form of the}} Maya stela incorporating art, calendrical dates and hieroglyphic text onto a royal monument only began to be erected in the Maya lowlands after 250 AD. The late 4th century saw the introduction of non-Maya imagery linked to the giant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico. This foreign influence is seen at Tikal, Uaxactun, Río Azul and ElZapote, all in the Petén Department of Guatemala. At Tikal this was initiated by the king YaxNuunAyiinI, from there it spread to his vassal cities. In the 5th century, this strongly Teotihuacan-linked imagery was abandoned by YaxNuunAyiinI's son SiyajChanK'awiilII, who reintroduced imagery associated with the Pacific Coast and adjacent highlands. Minor references to Teotihuacan continued, for example {{in the form of}} Teotihuacan war emblems. His Stela31 was originally erected in 445 but was later broken from its butt and was found buried in the city centre, almost directly above his tomb. It depicts the crowning of SiyajChanK'awiilII, with his father hovering above him as a supernatural being and is executed in traditional Maya style. On the sides of the stela are carved two portraits of his father in a non-Maya style, dressed as a Teotihuacan warrior, bearing the central Mexican atlatl spear-thrower not adopted by the Maya, and carrying a shield adorned <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of the Mexican god Tlaloc. The reverse of the stela bears a lengthy hieroglyphic inscription detailing the history of Tikal, including the Teotihuacan invasion that established Yax Nuun Ayiin I and his dynasty.|$|E

Both statues were made of bronze by José María Fernández Urbina. The Fuente de las Ranas (Fountain of the Frogs) was created in the 1920s, by Miguel Alessio Robles in Seville, Spain. The Nezahualcoyotl Fountain was inaugurated in 1956. It measures 1,250m2 and surrounds a statue of the Aztec ruler nine meters tall in black stone.|$|E

25|$|A cut is a cross-batted shot {{played at}} a short-pitched ball, placing it wide on the off side. The batsman makes {{contact with the}} ball as it draws {{alongside}} or passes him and therefore requires virtually no effort on his part as he uses the bowler's pace to divert the ball. A square cut is a shot hit into the off side at near to 90 degrees from the wicket (towards point). A late cut is played as or after the ball passes the batsman's body and is hit towards third man. The cut shot is typically played off the back foot, but is also sometimes played off the front foot against slower bowling. The cut should be played <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of the bat rolling over the ball to face the ground thus pushing the ball downwards. A mistimed cut with an open-faced bat (<b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>face</b> of the bat facing the bowler) will generally lead to the ball rising in the air, giving {{a chance for the}} batsman to be caught.|$|E
