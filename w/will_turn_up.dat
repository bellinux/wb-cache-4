25|$|A Game {{is being}} played... where heads or tails <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
25|$|Common intuition {{suggests}} that if a fair coin is tossed many times, then roughly half {{of the time it}} <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> heads, and the other half it <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> tails. Furthermore, the more often the coin is tossed, the more likely it should be that the ratio of the number of heads to the number of tails will approach unity. Modern probability theory provides a formal version of this intuitive idea, known as the law of large numbers. This law is remarkable because it is not assumed in the foundations of probability theory, but instead emerges from these foundations as a theorem. Since it links theoretically derived probabilities to their actual frequency of occurrence in the real world, the law of large numbers is considered as a pillar in the history of statistical theory and has had widespread influence.|$|E
25|$|The {{quest for}} the Dorian {{invasion}} had begun {{as an attempt to}} explain the differences between Peloponnesian society depicted by Homer and the historical Dorians of classical Greece. The first scholars to work on the problem were historians researching the only resources available to them: the Greek legends. The philologists (later linguists) subsequently took up the challenge but in the end only brought the problem into sharper definition. Finally the archaeologists have inherited the issue. Perhaps some distinctively Dorian archaeological evidence <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> or has turned up giving precise insight as to how and when Peloponnesian society changed so radically.|$|E

500|$|The {{species was}} first {{described}} in 1935 as Mycena fagicola by American mycologist Alexander H. Smith, based on specimens that he collected {{the previous year}} in Cross Village, Michigan. The naming, however, was illegitimate, {{as it had been}} previously used by Camille Grognot (as Mycena fagicola Grogn. apud Roumeguère published in 1885), so Smith changed the specific epithet to atkinsoniana in his 1947 monograph on North American Mycena species. Smith credited George Francis Atkinson with one of the early collections of the fungus in his 1935 species description. Mycena specialist Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus agreed with Smith's decision to change the epithet, concluding that although Grognot's name was a nomen nudum (written without an adequate description), he conceded that [...] "the possibility cannot be excluded that one day some overlooked 19th century booklet or exsiccatum <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> containing a description".|$|E

"MacDonald's uninterestingness is {{not unusual}} at all...When a {{journalist}} fetches up against someone like , all {{he can do is}} flee and hope that a more suitable subject <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> soon. In the MacDonald-McGinniss case we have an instance of a journalist who apparently found out too late that the subject of his book was not up to scratch — {{not a member of the}} wonderful race of auto-fictionalizers, like Joseph Mitchell's Joe Gould and Truman Capote's Perry Smith, on whom the [...] "non-fiction novel" [...] depends for its life...The solution that McGinniss arrived at for dealing with MacDonald's characterlessness was not a satisfactory one, but it had to do." ...|$|E

[...] The primary objective was simply to recruit more members for Scientology: [...] "Some {{small percentage of the}} persons visited or their families <b>will</b> <b>turn</b> <b>up</b> in his group. Thus he will build a group and naturally from that group he will get a great many individual preclears." [...] This was, however, not how the program was to be presented to the general public: [...] "A great many miracles will follow in his wake and he is later to become a subject of the press himself. However, in handling the press we should simply say that it is a mission of the Church to assist those who are in need of assistance." ...|$|E
