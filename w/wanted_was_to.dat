Lisa remains perfect in her picks for eight weeks, earning her father {{more and more}} money as the Super Bowl approaches. With his new money, Homer starts buying expensive presents for the family and treating them to fine dining. When Lisa asks Homer if they can go hiking the Sunday following the Super Bowl, he tells her that Daddy-Daughter Days are over until next football season.

5|$|To silence Luna, Aguinaldo {{appointed}} him as Chief of War Operations on 26 September 1898, and assigned {{the rank of}} brigadier general. In quick succession, he was made the Director or Assistant Secretary of War and Supreme Chief of the Republican Army on 28 September, arousing {{the envy of the}} other generals who were fighting since {{the first phase of the}} Revolution. Meanwhile, Luna felt that bureaucratic placebos were being thrown his way, when all he <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> organize and discipline the enthusiastic but ill-fed and ill-trained troops into a real army.|$|E
5|$|Naoi {{is a human}} {{originally}} {{thought to be a}} non-player character (non-human). After he died, Naoi developed hypnotic powers that allow him to control others and cause them to enter a dream-like state. In life, {{he was the son of}} a famous potter. However, it was his twin brother who had the talent in pottery and as a result, Naoi was ignored by everyone. When his brother died, he was made to replace him by his father and was given strict training in pottery. As a result, he felt as if his own life was fake and all he <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be acknowledged for his own existence. He later befriends Otonashi after he acknowledges him and joins the SSS. As acting student council president for a time and self-proclaimed God, Naoi is strict and arrogant, but this is quick to disperse when Otonashi chastises him. He is affectionate to Otonashi, much to the latter's chagrin, and always tries to earn his affection. He uses dual USP 45 handguns.|$|E

5|$|During {{the court}} case, Huseby {{stated that he}} wanted help from society and {{attention}} drawn to his cause. However, he stated that he regretted doing this by hijacking. He stated that all he <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{send a message to}} the minister of justice and prime minister that he needed help, and that he did not intend that the other passengers be aware of his threats. Huseby stated that the hijacking was spontaneous and that he planned to make an armed robbery or take hostages at the Radisson SAS hotel in Oslo. His defence lawyer argued that Huseby did not commit a hijacking in the letter of the law, but had instead taken hostages, which would result in a lesser sentence. The court psychologists stated that Huseby had a difficult childhood, and had been defined as an alcoholic at the age of 17. They considered him to have very underdeveloped ability to make rational decisions and weak mental health. They also stated that he committed crimes to identify himself due to his low self-esteem. On 29 May 1986, Huseby was found guilty of hijacking in Eidsivating Court of Appeal. He was sentenced to three years prison and five years of preventive supervision.|$|E

Now Sir Walter Scott was writing his own life of Napoleon, from a strictly conservative point of view, and Hazlitt wanted to produce one from a countervailing, liberal perspective. Really, his stance on Napoleon was his own, as he had idolised Napoleon for decades, and he prepared to return to Paris to undertake the research. First, however, he brought to fruition another favourite idea.|$|E

The chambers of Frederick and Victoria were carefully checked to find incriminating documents. However, the search was unsuccessful because all the couple's correspondence had been taken to Windsor Castle the previous year. Several years later, William II stated {{that the purpose of}} this research was to find state documents. Currently, however, many historians (as Hannah Pakula and Franz Herre) suggest that what the Emperor <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> recover documents that could threaten his reputation.|$|E

500|$|During the Dive Bar Tour, Gaga {{recalled}} {{that she and}} musician Hillary Lindsey were seated in couches and having a back-and-forth conversation with guitar and piano. The singer asked questions about the men in her life, including her father and boyfriends, wondering why they would give her million reasons to leave them, but all she <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> have one reason to stay. Lindsey, who previously had experiences in writing country songs in Nashville, was identified by Interscope as a potential collaborator on Joanne. The label's A Aaron Bay-Schuck, who had heard the initial Joanne material, introduced Gaga to Lindsey. They bonded over drinks and Gaga also played initial demos {{of some of the}} tracks she had written. Lindsey remembered that Gaga's personal experiences and stories resulted in many ideas for songs. [...] "Million Reasons" [...] was similarly picked from their conversations, including the title phrase. It was a straightforward songwriting session according to Lindsey, with Gaga using an [...] typewriter.|$|E
500|$|In March 1984, when NYU student Rick Rubin and promoter-manager Russell Simmons {{founded the}} then-independent Def Jam label, 16yearold St. Albans, Queens native James Todd Smith was {{creating}} demo tapes in his grandparents' home. His grandfather, a jazz saxophonist, purchased him $2,000 worth of stereo equipment, including two turntables, an audio mixer and an amplifier. Smith later discussed his childhood background and rapping, stating that [...] "By the time I got that equipment, I {{was already a}} rapper. In this neighborhood, the kids grow up in rap. It's like speaking Spanish if you grow up in an all-Spanish house. I got into it when I was about 9, and since then all I <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> make a record and hear it on the radio." [...] By using the mixing table he had received from his grandfather, Smith produced and mixed his own demos {{and sent them to}} various record companies throughout New York City, including Simmons' and Rubin's own Def Jam Recordings.|$|E

Then {{she and her friends}} travel back to the Emerald City to have their wishes granted. When they all storm into the Wizard's room, they {{discover}} it is merely a Hollywood effects stage and that the Wizard (Jeffrey Tambor) is just an ordinary man, pretending. He asked for the witch's eye so that she could not see him for who he really was. Even so, he still proceeds to grant their wishes. Dorothy finally becomes a singer in the Land of Oz, but she realizes that all she ever really <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> go back home and be with her family. After traveling back to Munchkinland, she meets Glinda the Good Witch of the South (Miss Piggy), who tells her that if she clicks her heels together three times, she will be able to go anywhere she desires, contrary to how the Good Witch of the North said to get to the Emerald City. She does so, saying [...] "take me home to Aunt Em".|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr, Klaus Voormann, and Jürgen Vollmer were early {{fans of the}} Beatles {{after they}} heard the group play in the Kaiserkeller. Kirchherr, Voormann's girlfriend, was {{initially}} horrified {{at the idea of}} spending any time in such a sordid district, but Voormann, after watching the Beatles several times without her, eventually persuaded her to come too. After having previously only listened to Trad jazz, the Platters, and Nat King Cole, the Rock n' Roll that the Beatles played was totally new to them. The three friends visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night, arriving at 9 o'clock and sitting by the front of the stage. Kirchherr, then 22 years old, later said: [...] "It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing... My whole life changed in a couple of minutes. All I <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be with them and to know them." [...] Sutcliffe was fascinated by Kirchherr, and Harry later wrote that when Kirchherr walked in, every head would immediately turn her way. Sutcliffe wrote to a friend that he could hardly take his eyes off her when she had first walked into the club, and tried to talk to her during the next break, but she had already left.|$|E
500|$|Kirchherr, Voormann and Vollmer {{were friends}} who had all {{attended}} the Meisterschule, and shared the same ideas about fashion, culture and music. Voormann became Astrid's boyfriend, and moved into the Kirchherr home, where {{he had his own}} room. In 1960, after Kirchherr and Vollmer had had an argument with Voormann, he wandered down the Reeperbahn (in the St. Pauli district of Hamburg) and heard music coming from the Kaiserkeller club. Voormann walked in and watched a performance by a group called the Beatles: Lennon, McCartney, Harrison, Sutcliffe and Best, their drummer at the time. Voormann asked Kirchherr and Vollmer to listen to this new music, and after being persuaded to visit the Kaiserkeller (which was in the rough area of the Reeperbahn), Kirchherr decided that all she {{wanted to do was to}} be as close to the Beatles as she could. The trio of friends had never heard this new music called Rock n' Roll before, having previously listened to only Trad jazz, with some Nat King Cole and The Platters mixed in. The trio then visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night, arriving at 9 o'clock and sitting by the front of the stage. Kirchherr later said: [...] "It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing... My whole life changed in a couple of minutes.

500|$|To {{design the}} missions, the {{designers}} {{began with a}} cohesive area, which they filled with activities for the player. They defined paths to the target areas, and developed and expanded them. They then populated the areas with NPCs, which they assigned to patrol routes and functions. The designers would then observe how players interacted with the level, using their abilities and powers to test whether the area provided a suitable challenge for the available powers, and then redesigned the level as needed. At first, the levels featured little directional information to emphasize the player's ability to traverse them as they choose, but in testing, players became lost or obeyed NPC commands to not enter an area, leaving them unable to proceed. In response, the developers introduced more visual cues and verbal hints to direct players. Some features and ideas were removed during the design process, including a mental institution where Corvo would have faced sound-sensitive patients. Discussing {{the use of violence}} and the consequences of in-game freedom, developer Joe Houston recounted his experience while watching a tester play a mission to infiltrate a masquerade ball; Houston determined that not killing the NPCs opened up more objectives and interactions, but the tester systematically killed every NPC in the level, which Houston found disconcerting. The team came under pressure to excise a scene {{from the end of the}} game where Samuel, in response to a player killing indiscriminately throughout the game, can betray Corvo by alerting enemies to his presence. Smith explained [...] "Everybody just wants to be told in a video game that you’re great, no matter what you do. If you slaughter everybody – you killed the maids, you killed the old people, you killed the beggars – you’re great, here’s a medal, you’re a hero... We decided that sounds psychotic. It doesn’t match our values... What we <b>wanted</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> let you express yourself in the game, but to have the world react to that, at least in some way. , betraying you and firing off that flare, was something we had to fight for." ...|$|E
