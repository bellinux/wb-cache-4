The ceiling shows signs of a dressed stone or <b>wooden</b> <b>screen</b> from the right wall {{to the end of}} the bench. To the right is a small cell in the same roof, {{probably}} connected with cave 19. The small cell has a bench along its right wall and the grooved doorway. The cave has two cisterns.|$|E
5|$|To {{the east}} of the {{entrance}} lies the dining room, which was formerly the Jacobean great hall. The room least damaged by the fire, it was restored by Barry to its 17th century appearance, with facsimiles of the original ceiling and carved <b>wooden</b> <b>screen.</b> It contains an overmantel featuring a relief of Plenty, considered to be original, and a large stone chimneypiece, which {{is believed to be the}} only surviving work by Blore on the interior. The oak parlour, in the south west, contains a large wooden Jacobean overmantel, featuring Green Men carving. The Jacobean carving here and in the dining room is noticeably cruder than the Victorian work. The carved parlour is another reproduction by Barry of the original. Panelled in oak, it has a plaster frieze of the Elements, Graces and Virtues. The alabaster chimneypiece depicts the winged figure of Time rewarding Industry and punishing Sloth, symbolised by two boys, which is surmounted by a carved portrait of Sir Randolph Crewe.|$|E
25|$|Inside, {{the rear}} {{stairway}} {{has a large}} carved newel post. Both parlors have Neoclassical black marble mantels that were preserved from an earlier building. Two later black marble mantels are in the reception room, which has a carved Louis XVI-style <b>wooden</b> <b>screen</b> supported by four Corinthian columns.|$|E

50|$|There {{also may}} have been some spiritual {{connotation}} similar to the chancel screen in churches. They were often <b>wooden</b> <b>screens</b> decorated with carvings or interlocking turned pieces of wood (similar to a mashrabiya).|$|R
50|$|The {{two types}} of carvings are stone and wood carvings. Stone carvings are mainly used to dot the stone pillars, while wood carvings are {{employed}} to make statues or <b>wooden</b> <b>screens.</b> Both embody the traditional arts of China.|$|R
25|$|Several Acehnese architects have {{attempted}} to modernize the traditional architecture of Aceh. One attempt is to replicate the roof canopy of the Cakra Donya bell (an ancient relic in Aceh) into the auditorium of the State Museum of Aceh. This reinterpretation of the Cakra Donya roof was completed by Wim Sutrisno, a local architect. The Cakra Donya roof style has become popular in Aceh {{and can be found}} decorating the gates to hotels or bus shelter roofs. The gable roof has also been reinterpreted in many buildings, often with double gable screens, complete with a protruding <b>wooden</b> <b>screen.</b>|$|E
500|$|Inside, {{although}} there is no structural division between the nave and the chancel, there is a 19th-century <b>wooden</b> <b>screen</b> with wrought-iron gates between them, and a step up into the chancel. [...] The sanctuary is marked with a further step, as is the base of the altar; both steps are decorated with encaustic tiles. The internal woodwork of the roof, which has seven bays (or sections), is exposed.|$|E
500|$|The {{hall and}} solar block are {{adjacent}} to the south tower, and were designed to be symmetrical when seen from the courtyard, although {{the addition of the}} additional stone buttresses in the 19th century has altered this appearance. The hall is [...] long and [...] wide, with has three large, wooden 13th-century arches supporting the roof, unusually, given its size, using lateral wooden collars, but no vertical king-posts. The roof's cruck joists now rest on 19th-century stone supports, but would have originally reached down to the ground. The roof is considered by the historian Henry Summerson to be a [...] "rare survival for the period". In the medieval period a <b>wooden</b> <b>screen</b> would have cut off the north end, providing a more secluded dining area.|$|E
50|$|From 1862 to 1863 {{the church}} was restored. According to Pevsner, it {{contains}} {{one of the most}} remarkable medieval <b>wooden</b> <b>screens</b> in Devon; It is a detailed parclose screen that may date to 1537 when Dame Anne St. Leger founded a chantry in the chapel.|$|R
50|$|Historically, Herbertstraße was {{the only}} area where {{prostitution}} was tolerated in Hamburg. In 1933, the Nazi authorities erected <b>wooden</b> <b>screens</b> to hide the illegal activities. Today, prostitution is legal in Herbertstraße and in surrounding parts of St. Pauli, {{as well as other}} designated areas within Hamburg.|$|R
50|$|The {{front wall}} of is faceted to allow plaques {{to be placed}} on the <b>wooden</b> <b>screens.</b> Tow {{rough-hewn}} posts stand {{in the body of the}} chapel. The altar is a simple wooden block of a sandstone plinth, standing on a raised area at the front wall.|$|R
500|$|Inside, {{the main}} {{staircase}} {{is made of}} oak, and the fireplaces of marble. The [...] long by [...] wide Great Chamber, {{also known as the}} Ball Room and the Long Gallery, originally had a pinewood floor. It was covered by new flooring after it became worn over time. The room is [...] high, with the ceiling arranged in fifteen panels. Within the room is a <b>wooden</b> <b>screen</b> made for Sir James Harrington in 1655 by woodcarver John Colt and painted to resemble stone. On top of the screen sits a bust of Charles I flanked by two lions. In the Dining Room, the panelling is believed to be from the original house, which Sir Edmund was so impressed by that he had it incorporated into the new building.|$|E
500|$|The castle bailey {{contained}} {{a number of}} buildings by the 14th century. On the north side were the Great Hall, the buttery and the castle kitchens, the former lit by a large decorative window and partitionedfrom the kitchen and buttery by a <b>wooden</b> <b>screen.</b> Above the buttery was a luxurious solar, or apartment. On {{the south side of}} the bailey were the western lodgings, well-equipped accommodation for guests, built by in-filling part of the ditch between the motte and the bailey, and later converted into a bakery. A chapel and accommodation for the castle's chaplain lay alongside, and the chapel has remaining plaster work, which shows that the walls were painted with red lines to resemble ashlar cut stone. On the far side of the chapel were the eastern lodgings, whose detailing mirrored those at Tiverton Castle, another de Courtenay property built in the same period.|$|E
2500|$|In {{keeping with}} this journey down a more Roman Catholic path, in 1874 George Street was invited by the then Vicar to {{redesign}} the building. Street's plan would involve vast work.

Its decorative touches include columns in antis and a wood cornice. Its eyebrow windows have Greek key-patterned <b>wooden</b> <b>screens.</b> Its construction predates 1841.|$|R
50|$|There are {{original}} <b>wooden</b> <b>screens,</b> {{through which}} {{you enter the}} chapel from the south aisle or the chancel. In {{the centre of the}} chapel is an alabaster tomb chest, a monument to John Vernon of Harlaston, who died in 1545, and his wife Ellen; they are shown recumbent.|$|R
50|$|Woodford {{did some}} {{decorative}} {{work for the}} liner RMS Queen Mary, carving <b>wooden</b> <b>screens</b> and designing bronze uplighters for the cabin class smoking room.

2500|$|St Nicholas' Church {{contains}} one of {{the oldest}} surviving carved Norman screens. The basic structure, including the tower, is Anglo-Saxon, but it has been much altered over the centuries. For example, the influence of the Normans {{can be seen in the}} arches, the timber roofing (thought to date back to 1165) and the unique carved <b>wooden</b> <b>screen</b> in the chancel. Other features were added in the generations that followed, such as the spire (14th century), the pulpit and the clock (17th century). [...] The church is grade I.|$|E
2500|$|In 1900 Kate Cranston gave Mackintosh the {{opportunity}} to redesign an entire room, at the Ingram Street tearoom. He had just recently married the artist Margaret MacDonald, and together they created the White Dining Room, including a hallway opening onto the street and divided off by a <b>wooden</b> <b>screen</b> with leaded glass panels, giving those entering glimpses into the room itself. His fame was spreading, and in 1902 The Studio wrote of [...] "Miss Cranston, whose tea-rooms, designed by Mr. Mackintosh, are reckoned {{by some of the}} pilgrims to Glasgow as one of the sights of the city." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1860 {{the church}} was {{restored}} to designs by the architect Samuel Seckham. The 15th century east window of the chancel was removed and replaced by a Gothic Revival one in a 14th-century style. The set of three 15th century <b>wooden</b> <b>screens</b> was to be removed, had not the then Bishop of Oxford, Samuel Wilberforce, personally intervened to save them.|$|R

50|$|This church, {{dedicated}} to the saints Peter and Paul, was renovated in 1772 CE by the Copt Lutfallah Shaker. The church has twelve domes. Nine of the domes roof the nave {{and the other three}} are over the sanctuaries, which are characterized by inlaid <b>wooden</b> <b>screens.</b> In 2005, the monks' cells dating to the 4th century - the oldest ever found - were discovered beneath the Church of the Apostles.|$|R
2500|$|Several {{decades after}} the monks {{returned}} to their Priory on the Thames, the {{major part of the}} building at Warfield was constructed out of what the monks left behind. The Tower was built in the mid 15th century and the present bell tower was completed. In the 1500s the picture of the Church would have been one of priest with his helpers in the chancel, dressed in colourful robes, speaking hardly audible tones in Latin. [...] Across the entrance to the Chancel was a large <b>wooden</b> <b>screen</b> with statutes on it. A restored version using some of the original carving is across the entrance to St Katherine's Chapel today. The walls were highly painted with pictures and texts.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{entrance}} to the Bruen chapel is a 14th-century <b>wooden</b> <b>screen.</b> [...] On its south wall is a squint with a carved image, known as the [...] "church imp", who looks through the squint.
