5|$|The {{concept of}} motive is also explored. When confronting Padgett, Mulder asks {{him why he}} is murdering his victims. Padgett, in turn, admits that he cannot answer the question. Kaner {{suggests}} that Padgett is representative of a version of Mulder, {{and that there is}} a direct parallel between being a criminal profiler—who must think like the criminal—and a writer—who must think like his characters. In the end, however, Padgett sacrifices his personal quest—his manuscript—in order to be free. This presents a distinct contrast to Mulder, <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> truly give up his obsession. Michelle Bush, in her book Myth-X, also notes that the episode sheds light on Scully's motive throughout the series: she wants to gain Mulder's attention, something she feels she does not have. Padgett eventually realizes this, and sacrifices himself for her love.|$|E

25|$|Postage stamps {{are also}} object of a {{particular}} form of collecting. Stamp collecting {{has been a very}} popular hobby.

Stamp collecting is commonly known as philately, although strictly the latter term refers to the study of stamps.|$|E

25|$|The Nizari Ismaili {{tradition}} {{is unique in}} that it is the only tradition that bears witness to the continuity of the hereditary divine authority vested in the Imamim-Mubeen. In all the Sunni traditions, the Imamim-Mubeen is interpreted as the Quran itself; and in all the Shia traditions except the Shia Nizari tradition it is interpreted as the last Imam of a dynasty who went into occultation. However, in Nizari Ismailism, it is interpreted as a living human Imam who is never in occultation and <b>who</b> <b>will</b> <b>never</b> ever be absent from this world but will always be perpetually present and physically alive, and who is designated as the inheritor of the Imamat from father to son. This tradition has continued for almost 1400 years from Ali to the present Imam-of-the-Time, Prince Karim al-Hussaini Aga Khan, the 49th hereditary Nizari Imam and direct descendant of Mohammad through Ali and Fatima az-Zahra.|$|E
