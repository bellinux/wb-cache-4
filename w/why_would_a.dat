500|$|The {{idea for}} 7 Khoon Maaf came when Ruskin Bond sent his book of Short Story {{collection}} to Vishal Bhardwaj. He {{was intrigued by}} a four-page story's title named [...] "Susanna's Seven Husbands", and thought it had potential for a novel and a film. Bhardwaj said, [...] "I told myself <b>why</b> <b>would</b> <b>a</b> woman have seven husbands and then I came {{to know that she}} also kills them! I was immediately hooked to it. It reminded me of a very old film, Bluebeard's Seven Wives". Bhardwaj suggested the story to a fellow director, who was looking for a good story. However, after reading the short story, the director dismissed it saying it has no film potential. After reading the story twice, he became even more confident about possibility of a film. Bhardwaj who had previously adapted Bond's novel The Blue Umbrella into a film, decided to adapt the short story for the screen. Bhardwaj later requested Bond to turn the story into a novella, noting that only Bond could flesh out the characters well, to which he agreed. Bond expanded the story into an 80-page novella, which later became a 200-page full-length Hindi script. Bhardwaj co-wrote the script with Matthew Robbins.|$|E

There are three possible explanations for this phenomenon. First, it is possible that Buenos Aires offered amenities, like a better climate and a different culture, that were missing in Chicago.

We consider a model with asymmetric information between financiers and entrepreneurs which gives rise to sizable inefficiencies. Under simple conditions, both the debt and the equity markets collapse and no project is financed. Or else, all projects are financed and there is overinvestment. However when the entrepreneurs can hire managers and write publicly observable contracts leaving the financing and investment decisions to the manager, first-best efficiency is restored. We argue {{that this is an}} example of a more general phenomena that delegation of control through observable and enforceable contracts to a third party will often increase efficiency in a principle-agent type relationship...|$|R
