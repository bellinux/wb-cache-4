I think we're lucky because the guests <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> show often comment on what a good atmosphere Holby has.

2500|$|John Brickels, an {{assistant}} coach for the Cleveland Browns in the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC), noticed Ulinski when he was playing at Marshall. Brickels had been a high school coach in Huntington, West Virginia, where Marshall is located, and saw him in action again when he played for the Super-Bombers. At Brickels' urging, Ulinski signed with the Browns in 1946. The Browns finished that season with a 12–2 record {{and went on to}} win the first AAFC championship. Ulinski was named a second-team All-Pro. Cleveland won the AAFC championship again in 1947, when Ulinski began playing middle linebacker on defense in addition to his role on the offensive line. Paul Brown, the coach of the Browns, called him the best offensive guard in the AAFC, and said the team [...] "discovered he is about as good a middle line backer as <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team".|$|E

6000|$|WORKS OF CARLYLE. The {{beginner}} {{will do well}} to make {{acquaintance with}} Carlyle {{in some of the}} minor essays, which are less original but more pleasing than his labored works. Among the best essays are those on Goethe (who was Carlyle's first master), Signs of the Times, Novalis, and especially Scott and Burns. With Scott he was not in sympathy, and though he tried as a Scotsman to be [...] "loyal to kith and clan," [...] a strong touch of prejudice mars his work. With Burns he succeeded better, and his picture of the plowboy genius in misfortune {{is one of the best}} <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject. This Essay on Burns is also notable as the best example of Carlyle's early style, before he compounded the strange mixture which appeared in his later books.|$|E
60|$|This {{decoration}} by discs, or shield-like ornaments, is {{a marked}} characteristic of Venetian architecture in its earlier ages, and is carried into later {{times by the}} Byzantine Renaissance, already distinguished from the more corrupt forms of Renaissance, in Appendix 6.

In Plate VII. we have an earlier condition of it, one of the discs being there sculptured, the others surrounded by sculptured bands: here <b>we</b> <b>have,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Ducal Palace, the most characteristic of all, because likest to the shield, which was probably {{the origin of the}} same ornament among the Arabs, and assuredly among the Greeks.

60|$|<b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{right of}} the picture, the steam and the smoke of a passing steamboat. Now steam is nothing but an {{artificial}} cloud {{in the process of}} dissipation; it is as much a cloud as those of the sky itself, that is, a quantity of moisture rendered visible in the air by imperfect solution. Accordingly, observe how exquisitely irregular and broken are its forms, how sharp and spray-like; but with all the facts observed which were pointed out in Chap. II. of this Section, the convex side to the wind, the sharp edge on that side, the other soft and lost. Smoke, on the contrary, is an actual substance existing independently in the air, a solid opaque body, subject to no absorption nor dissipation but that of tenuity. Observe its volumes; there is no breaking up nor disappearing here; the wind carries its elastic globes before it, but does not dissolve nor break them.[37] Equally convex and void of angles on all sides, they are the exact representatives of the clouds of the old masters, and serve at once to show the ignorance and falsehood of these latter, and the accuracy of study which has guided Turner to the truth.|$|E

Now, just consider for a moment the operations which have to be performed daily in the ordinary working and running of your passenger traffic. These 700 trains stop about 5000 times in the twenty-four hours, and of course they start the same number of times. The empty trains and engines have also to stop and start. <b>We</b> <b>have</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line upwards of 1000 signals, including the telegraphic signals and auxiliaries. Those signals have to be raised and lowered 10,000 times in the twenty-four hours.

In {{addition to}} all this there are the operations of shunting, carriage-examining, greasing, and other things in connexion with trains which involve operations amounting to nearly 6000 in number.

6000|$|And what is {{the dire}} {{necessity}} and [...] "iron" [...] law under which men groan? Truly, most gratuitously invented bugbears. I suppose if there be an [...] "iron" [...] law, it is that of gravitation; and if there be a physical necessity, it is that a stone, unsupported, must fall to the ground. But what is all we really know and can know about the latter phænomenon? Simply, that, in all human experience, stones have fallen to the ground under these conditions; {{that we have not}} the smallest reason for believing that any stone so circumstanced will not fall to the ground; and that <b>we</b> <b>have,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> contrary, {{every reason to believe that}} it will so fall. It is very convenient to indicate that all the conditions of belief have been fulfilled in this case, by calling the statement that unsupported stones will fall to the ground, [...] "a law of nature."
