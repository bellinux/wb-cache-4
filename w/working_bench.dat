40|$|Of all Dickens's {{eccentric}} children – whose numbers {{include the}} Artful Dodger, Paul Dombey, Little Nell, and Smike – none, perhaps, is more peculiarly “old-fashioned” than Jenny Wren in Our Mutual Friend (1864 - 65). From her first appearance, Jenny exhibits a strange indeterminacy: A parlour door within a small entry stood open, and disclosed a child – a dwarf – a girl – a something – {{sitting on a}} little low old-fashioned arm-chair, which {{had a kind of}} little <b>working</b> <b>bench</b> before it. “I can't get up,” said the child, “because my back's bad, and my legs are queer. But I'm the person of the house. ” (222; bk. 2, ch. 1) This description of Jenny cannot settle. The initial assumption that she is a child is placed in doubt as she becomes, in quick succession, a “dwarf,” a “girl,” a “something. ” It is left to her to define how she should be perceived, but the phrase she chooses – “the person of the house” – only compounds the confusion. Throughout this article I follow the spirit of this passage. Rather than pursuing a “true” description of Jenny Wren, I offer a reading that puts her indeterminacy centre-stage, along with her job as a “dolls’ dressmaker” for wealthy women. In her appearance, her work, and her language, I argue, Jenny calls into question how gender and child/adult identities are constructed in nineteenth-century society, both in her own working-class milieu, where she is taunted by local children (224; bk. 2, ch. 1), and in the fashionable upper- and middle-class world to whose whims she caters. In addition, I draw upon Thomas Carlyle's novel Sartor Resartus (1833 - 34) and the work of Walter Benjamin to suggest that Jenny's satirical and playful use of words constitutes a philosophical critique of the mutability of appearance in mid-nineteenth-century modernity...|$|E
40|$|Mining is {{an arduous}} job and involve risk at each working stage. In {{open cast mining}} method, {{since it is the}} main focus as it {{contributes}} major portion of production, stability of the slope is of utmost importance. To avoid a slope from failure, working is to be carried out in accordance with the guidelines and safety standards. The factor of safety of the working slope has to be calculated and monitored from time to time so that safe working environment can be created and the slope can be avoided from failure. Factor of safety often calculated by the traditional deterministic analysis methods cannot exactly represent the stability of the slope. Case of Rajpardi Lignite Mine (GMDC) has been considered for this project. The working benches with height 3 m are very steep with individual bench slope angle varying from 80 o to almost 90 o. A total of 50 benches has been considered in a single formation for calculation of factor of safety with varying overall slope angle. The probability of failure of slope increases by increasing the overall slope angle of the <b>working</b> <b>bench.</b> A benchmark safety factor of 1. 20 was set to consider the working conditions to be safe. Beyond this safety factor, working would be difficult and risky and probability of failure will be more. SURPAC software was used to make the solid and block model. Volume calculation, reserve estimation and average grade calculation was done using the borehole data of the mine. Followed by SURPAC, FLAC/Slope is used for calculation of factor of safety and numerical modelling of the slope. A total of five sections were considered to calculate the factor of safety with varying rock type. The sections were incorporated into FLAC/Slope from the block model that was made in SURPAC.

The present interpretation of the development of the orebody is as follows. A phase of copper iron sulfide mineralization was associated with the initial intrusion of the Kaverong Quartz Diorite/Biotite Diorite differentiate into the Panguna Andesite country rock. This mineralization was successively upgraded by a remobilization of copper sul-fides with the intrusion of the Biotite Granodiorite and by an addition of higher grade copper associated with the Leucocratic Quartz Diorite. Breccias associated with the Biotite Granodiorite are significant sources of higher grade ore. Alteration is generally of weak to moderate intensity and essentially of the potassium and propylitic types. Quartz, sericite, and kaolin may locally become important.

40|$|Ground {{excavation}} {{constitutes a}} significant component of production costs in any surface mining operation. The excavation process entails material digging and removal {{in which the}} equipment motion is constrained by the workspace geometry. A major excavation problem is the variability of material properties, resulting in varying mechanical energy input and stress loading of shovel dipper-and-tooth assembly across the <b>working</b> <b>bench.</b> This variability has {{a huge impact on}} the shovel dipper and tooth assembly in hard formations. With this in mind, the primary objectives of the project were to (i) provide the theoretical basis to develop the Intelligent Shovel Excavation (ISE) technology to solve the problems associated with excavation in material formations; (ii) advance knowledge and frontiers in shovel excavation through intelligent navigation; and (iii) submit proposal for the design, development and implementation of the ISE technology for shovel excavation at experimental surface mining sites. The mathematical methods were used to (i) develop shovel's kinematics and dynamics, and (ii) establish the relationship between shovel parameters and the resistive forces from the material formation during excavation process. The ADAMS simulation environment was used to develop the hydraulic and cable shovel virtual prototypes. Two numerical examples are included to test the theoretical hypotheses and the obtained results are discussed. The area of sensor technology was studied. Application of specific wrist-mounted sensors to characterize the material, bucket and frame assembly was determined. Data acquisition, display and control system for shovel loading technology was adopted. The concept of data acquisition and control system was designed and a shovel boom stresses were simulated. A multi-partner collaboration between research organizations, shovel manufacturer, hardware and sensor technology companies, and surface mining companies is proposed to test design features, construct a field ready prototype and perform field testing at the surface mining sites.

40|$|During recent years, the Australian coal {{industry}} has increasingly used large walking draglines {{as the dominant}} waste removal equipment in open cut coal mines. Because {{of the nature of}} the coal formations, dragline operations in Australian coal mining situations are quite complex and draglines are frequently used in applications beyond their normal capabilities. With the current trend to increasing dragline sizes in most of the Australian coal mines, the draglines become the highest capital investment item in these mines. It is therefore necessary to give detailed attention to the optimising operating procedures of the dragline. Dragline productivity and its stripping capabilities are directly affected by the selection of digging method, strip layout and pit geometry. Every mine has a unique combination of geological conditions. The operating methods that work well at one mine may not necessarily work at another site. Selection of an optimal stripping method, strip layout and pit geometry for a given dragline must be considered with respect to the geological conditions of the mines. With increasing geological complexity of Australian strip mines, it is becoming more important to use sophisticated techniques such as computerised mine planning methods to assist in optimising the dragline operations. A computerised dragline simulation model (CADSIM) has been developed for use in selection of optimum strategies for a dragline operation. The procedure developed links with a geological ore body model to develop a geological database for simulation. CADSIM model can be used in selection the most cost effective dragline digging method. A specific simulation language, 2 ̆ 2 DSLX 2 ̆ 2, was used to program seven common and innovative dragline methods currently used in Australian open cut mines.

Released as the Fabrique Nationale GP35, it was more popularly known as the successful Browning Hi-Power pistol, a favorite of sportsmen, gun collectors as well as many military and law enforcement agencies around the world.|$|R
