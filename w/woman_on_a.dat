5|$|Breuer {{attended}} the Paralympics in London, {{but as a}} wheelchair basketball player {{rather than as a}} fencer. She was introduced to the sport by a friend, and spotted by a national trainer. Breuer played for Sabines Ulm, where she was the only <b>woman</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> mixed gender side. She is classified as a 1.5 point player, but women get a 1.5 point bonus when playing on a mixed team, making her in effect a zero-point player. Her classification, along with her high technical acumen, means that she is a valuable asset on any team.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{motorcyclist}} fires {{shots at}} the moving car of Lewis and Falsone; the two narrowly avoid injury and the motorcyclist escapes. Almost immediately afterward, Lewis and Falsone are called to investigate {{the shooting death of}} a <b>woman</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> nearby street. At the scene they find Stivers (Toni Lewis), who was speaking to the woman when she was shot; police later conclude Stivers was the real target. While Munch and Kellerman are leaving the hotel, somebody opens fire on them and shoots Kellerman in the arm. Falsone suggests the shooter is targeting the detectives {{who were involved in the}} previous fatal shooting of drug dealer Luther Mahoney. Kellerman becomes angry when Falsone questions the report of Mahoney's death, which indicates Kellerman shot Mahoney to save Lewis; Falsone said autopsy reports indicate Mahoney was beaten badly.|$|E
5|$|The {{police had}} only two clues: some {{footprints}} in the garden, and a hat that they found in a nearby gutter. The police took moulds of the footprints and endeavored to trace the hat, but with no success. However, during routine questioning of local residents, police learned that earlier in {{the afternoon of the}} murder, a man had been seen sitting with a heavily-pregnant young <b>woman</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> bench at one end of South Cliff Avenue; the man had also been seen wandering the street while the young woman sat on the bench alone, leading police to suspect that the man was assessing the lay of the land.|$|E

The film stars Ananda Everingham, has an {{appearance}} by American bilingual actor Erich Fleshman, and was shot by Christopher Doyle. The short film is shot in a minimalist style and slowly moves along the encounters {{of a man and a}} <b>woman</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> long-haul flight, where they spend the next 12 hours and 20 minutes reading, drinking, eating and watching movies and sleeping by each other's side without talking.|$|E

25|$|Speke {{had earlier}} proven his mettle by {{trekking}} {{through the mountains}} of Tibet, but Burton regarded him as inferior as he did not speak any Arabic or African languages. Despite his fascination with non-European cultures, some have portrayed Burton as an unabashed imperialist convinced of the historical and intellectual superiority of the white race, citing {{his involvement in the}} Anthropological Society, an organization that established a doctrine of scientific racism. Speke appears to have been kinder and less intrusive to the Africans they encountered, and reportedly fell in love with an African <b>woman</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> future expedition.|$|E
25|$|La risata (1911, The Laugh) is {{considered}} his first truly Futurist work. He had fully parted with Divisionism, and now {{focused on the}} sensations derived from his observation of modern life. Its public reception was quite negative, compared unfavorably with Three Women, and it was defaced by a visitor, running his fingers through the still fresh paint. Subsequent criticism became more positive, with some considering the painting a response to Cubism. It was purchased by Albert Borchardt, a German collector who acquired 20 Futurist works exhibited in Berlin, including The Street Enters the House (1911) which depicts a <b>woman</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> balcony overlooking a busy street. Today the former also {{is owned by the}} Museum of Modern Art, and the latter by the Sprengel Museum in Hanover.|$|E
25|$|Devil May Cry 3 {{opens in}} Dante's yet-unnamed shop in an American metropolis. A mysterious man, Arkham, arrives with an {{invitation}} from Dante's brother Vergil {{in the guise of}} a demonic attack. After Dante defeats his adversaries, a huge tower erupts from the ground nearby, eclipsing the sprawling city surrounding it. Sensing that Vergil is on the structure, Dante interprets this as a challenge. He begins fighting demons during his journey; once defeated, they become his weapons. Dante is attacked by a <b>woman</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> motorcycle who turns out to be Mary, Arkham's daughter, who wants revenge on her father for causing her mother's death. Arkham works for Vergil; they plan to take Dante's half of their mother's amulet and use its power on the tower to connect the human and demonic worlds.|$|E

25|$|With President Bush {{ineligible for}} a third term and Vice President Dick Cheney not {{pursuing}} the party's nomination, Arizona Senator John McCain quickly emerged as the Republican Party's presidential nominee, receiving President Bush's endorsement on March 6, six months before official ratification at the 2008 Republican National Convention. On August 29, Senator McCain announced Governor Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running-mate, making her the first <b>woman</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Republican Presidential ticket. McCain surged ahead of Obama in the national polls following the nominationm but amid a financial crisis and a serious economic downturn, McCain and Palin went on to lose the election to Democrats Barack Obama and running mate Joe Biden. Since 1992, the 2012 presidential election was the sixth consecutive election in which the Republican candidate failed to win at least 300 electoral votes, suggesting a ceiling on GOP strength and a modicum margin of error should an election become highly competitive.|$|E
25|$|Soon {{after the}} funeral, Octavianus meets Pansa (Jack Angel), {{formerly}} Caesar's most trusted spy. With Pansa's help, Octavianus sneaks into the Senate where Maecenas (Larry Cedar), Antonius' secretary, proposes {{that rather than}} immediately executing Vipsanius, they hold a gladiatorial tournament across the Empire, the winner of which will perform the execution. Antonius approves of the idea, but dictates that Vipsania (Moira Quirk), Vipsanius' wife, be publicly executed immediately. Agrippa arrives back in Rome, and Octavianus explains the situation. At the execution, presided over by Decius Brutus (Daniel Riordan), Agrippa attempts to save Vipsania, but as they flee, she is stabbed in the back by Decius, who then defeats Agrippa in combat. However, before Agrippa can be arrested, he and Octavianus are saved by a <b>woman</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> chariot. She reveals her name is Claudia (Nicole Balick), a female gladiator. She tells them about the gladiatorial tournament, and that her brother, Sextus (Roger Rose) runs a gladiator camp which Agrippa could join to gain entry to the tournament and possibly save his father. Meanwhile, Octavianus will remain in Rome and investigate the murder.|$|E
500|$|Melanie Barnett {{has been}} {{negatively}} received by television critics. Melanie McFarland of The Seattle Post-Intelligencer panned the character {{along with the}} show's main premise ("A <b>woman</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> professional track kicks it all aside to chase a football player"), feeling that they were contradictory to {{the message of the}} parent show Girlfriends. Echoing McFarland's assessment, The San Francisco Chronicles Tim Goodman found Melanie's decision to be [...] "a bleak little life lesson". When discussing the transition to BET, Britney Wilson of Clutch was critical of the deterioration of female friendships on the show, citing [...] "the disintegration of the female identity" [...] as signs of The Game declining quality.|$|E

500|$|The {{painting}} shows a teary-eyed <b>woman</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> turbulent sea. She is emotionally distressed, seemingly from a romance. A thought bubble reads: [...] "I Don't Care! I'd Rather Sink— Than Call Brad For Help!" [...] This narrative element {{highlights the}} clichéd melodrama, while its graphics reiterate Lichtenstein's theme of painterly work imitating mechanized reproduction. The work {{is derived from}} a 1962 DC Comics panel, while also borrowing from Hokusai's The Great Wave off Kanagawa and from elements of modernist artists Jean Arp and Joan Miró. It {{is one of several}} Lichtenstein works that mention a character named Brad who is absent from the picture. Both the graphical and narrative elements of the work are cropped from the source image.|$|E

Diana has had to fight for everything in her life, so she works hard in order to survive. Badler added {{in an interview with}} Network Ten that Diana is highly ambitious and very driven, which makes her kind of like a man.

Diana sleeps with Paul, despite the fact that he is married and she becomes a suspect following an attempt on his life. Badler and Diana were well received by critics.|$|E

Bass played Kevin, a man who falls in love with a <b>woman</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Chicago train and begins a search to find her again. The film was produced by Bass's production company, A Happy Place (later renamed Bacon & Eggs), and featured appearances by Jerry Stiller, Al Green, Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora, former WWE wrestler Chyna, and Bass's bandmates Timberlake, Kirkpatrick and Fatone, the latter in a major role.
