5|$|No {{official}} {{action was}} taken: Ireland was exporting food to Britain at the time. Also, Paul Emrys-Evans {{revealed that the}} convoy knew about the U-boat; the British stance was that, as it already knew {{of the presence of}} both Irish Oak and U-607, {{there was no need for}} Irish Oak to have <b>warned</b> <b>the</b> convoy.|$|E
5|$|The tutor's son {{heard the}} screams {{by the river}} {{and came back to}} {{retrieve}} his mother and two younger sisters.

5|$|As Lane {{came closer}} to the coastline, all the {{seaports}} between Michoacán and Sinaloa were closed, and the Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (Mexico) (National Meteorological Service, in Spanish) <b>warned</b> <b>the</b> general population about the threat of flooding and landslides. When the hurricane made landfall, {{the government of the}} state of Sinaloa issued a state of emergency for the municipalities of Ahome, Guasave, Angostura, Salvador Alvarado, Culiacán, Navolato, Elota, San Ignacio and Mazatlán. The arrival of the hurricane forced the closure of several flights at the General Rafael Buelna International Airport in Mazatlán, Sinaloa.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} it was not known which {{submarine}} had sunk Irish Oak. The survivors knew only that it was not U-650. In the House of Commons Sir William Davidson called for a formal protest, because Irish Oak had not <b>warned</b> <b>the</b> convoy, and Douglas Lloyd Savory called for an end of coal exports to Ireland.|$|E
5|$|For the operation, the Germans {{committed}} five Air Corps to the attack, comprising 1,100 aircraft. The {{operation was}} launched on 3 June 1940. British intelligence had <b>warned</b> <b>the</b> French {{of the impending}} attack, and the operation failed to achieve the strategic results desired by the Oberkommando der Luftwaffe (High Command of the Air Force). Fortunately for the Luftwaffe, {{the plight of the}} French ground and air forces at this stage meant that the failure of the operation would not impede the defeat of France.|$|E

The bill eventually passed in an overwhelming fashion 39 to 20, on February 8, 1791.|$|E
5|$|On April 21, 1981, four EPB commandos {{were able}} to extract $348,000 from a Wells Fargo armored car, with the group later noting {{that it would be}} spent in their cause. In November 1981, the EPB detonated {{explosives}} in AEE substations in Santurce, a district of San Juan. When 350 families that occupied a makeshift village in Carolina, Puerto Rico, were removed by the police, the EPB <b>warned</b> <b>the</b> governor that they would retaliate.

5|$|Once {{the embassy}} had been tipped off {{that there was}} a spy {{operating}} in the facility in early 1944, Bazna found it increasingly difficult to gather intelligence. The British Field Office had <b>warned</b> <b>the</b> embassy of a security leak. Bazna forwarded the document to the Germans. The warning had come to Churchill from Roosevelt, who obtained the information given by a defector to the United States. A new alarm system in the British Embassy now required Bazna to remove a fuse whenever he wanted to look in the ambassador's safe.|$|E

5|$|After {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone advisory was issued on Tropical Storm Dorothy, a hurricane watch and storm warning were issued for the Leeward Islands from Dominica northward. As its westward track became more apparent, the watches and warnings were extended southward to include Martinique and Saint Lucia. On Martinique, authorities {{released a statement}} that <b>warned</b> <b>the</b> public for the potential for strong winds, heavy rainfall, and rough waves. Also on the island, officials converted schools and government buildings into shelters for people in low-lying areas. As {{a result of the}} storm, the Martinique Aimé Césaire International Airport in Le Lamentin was closed.|$|E
5|$|After three days' rest, {{they set}} off again, searching for the trail. Eddy {{eventually}} succumbed to his hunger and ate human flesh, but that was soon gone. They began to take apart their snowshoes to eat the oxhide webbing and discussed killing Luis and Salvador for food, before Eddy <b>warned</b> <b>the</b> two men and they quietly left. Jay Fosdick died during the night, leaving only seven members of the party. Eddy and Mary Graves left to hunt, but when they returned with deer meat, Fosdick's body had already been cut apart for food. After several more days—25 since they had left Truckee Lake—they came across Salvador and Luis, who had not eaten for about nine days and were close to death. William Foster shot the pair, believing that their flesh was the group's last hope of avoiding imminent death from starvation.|$|E
5|$|Andriamampandry {{tried on}} several {{occasions}} to warn Andriamasinavalona {{of the danger of}} administering the kingdom in this way. In one instance, he placed a hen {{in the middle of a}} room, then set one red rooster free in each corner. The roosters attacked one another viciously, leaving the king speechless. On another day, the elder brought four eagles to the king in a basket. When the basket was opened, the eagles flew wildly about the room, creating havoc. Andriamampandry <b>warned</b> <b>the</b> king that his realm would be no better off once his four sons got a taste of power. Andriamasinavalona recognized the danger but could not bear to choose which among his sons should be excluded from having a part in the decision-making responsibilities of the kingdom, so ignored the elder's advice. Finally Andriamampandry decided to give the king a very explicit warning. Andriamasinavalona had gathered his people in Andohalo to give a speech, when Andriamampandry set a bull loose into the crowd. In the panic that ensued, numerous people were gored or trampled to death, several pregnant women miscarried, and the gathering dispersed in chaos. The king demanded to know who had loosed the bull so that he may be executed, but when Andriamampandry took responsibility he <b>warned</b> <b>the</b> king that yet more blood would be spilled before the earth would be quenched. He then criticized the king for his concern over the relatively few deaths at the gathering, in light of the number of people who would die as a consequence of his division of Imerina. He further predicted that the prince at Ambohimanga would unite Imerina and lead it back to greatness. Andriamasinavalona reportedly had no response to give Andriamampandry, but instead hung his head in shame.|$|E

5|$|Before {{he worked}} for Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen in 1943, Bazna was hired to do some {{household}} and vehicle repairs for Douglas Busk, the first secretary of the British Embassy. Due to Bazna's poor English, he answered all interview questions in French. Although he supplied some written biographical information, excluding having been employed and fired by Albert Jenke, none of the biographical information was checked. Turkish secret service apparently <b>warned</b> <b>the</b> embassy at some point about Bazna. Over the few months that Bazna worked for Busk, he secretly photographed a few documents and, {{with the help of}} Mrs. Busk's nursemaid named Mara, he tried to gain access to more valuable forms of intelligence.|$|E
5|$|Between 1962 and 1992 {{there was}} a {{hardened}} nuclear bunker, built for No 16 Group Royal Observer Corps Shrewsbury, who provided the field force of the United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation and would have sounded the four-minute warning alarm {{in the event of}} war and <b>warned</b> <b>the</b> population of Shrewsbury in the event of approaching radioactive fallout. The building was manned by up to 120 volunteers who trained on a weekly basis and wore a Royal Air Force style uniform. After the breakup of the communist bloc in 1989, the Royal Observer Corps was disbanded between September 1991 and December 1995. However, the nuclear bunker still stands just inside Holywell Street near the Abbey as a lasting reminder of the Cold War, but is now converted and used as a veterinary practice.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of Mexican {{casualties}} {{range from}} one to three soldiers killed and from three to seven wounded. Approximately 20soldiers escaped. They <b>warned</b> <b>the</b> garrisons at Copano and Refugio of the advancing Texians; those garrisons abandoned their posts and joined the soldiers at Fort Lipantitlán. Milam escorted the remaining Mexican soldiers to Gonzales, where the newly formed Texian Army was located. The Texian Army commander, Stephen F. Austin, later released all of the men, {{on the condition that}} they leave Texas and vow to stop fighting Texas residents. One wounded Mexican soldier was allowed to remain in Goliad, as was Captain Manuel Sabriego, who was married to a local woman. In secret, Sabriego began organizing a group of settlers in the Goliad area who sympathized with Mexico.|$|E
