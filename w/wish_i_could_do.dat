He was awarded the Order of the Badge of Honour for his work on power stations in the Urals during World War II (while he was also establishing himself as the world's strongest chess player). He earned his doctorate in electrical engineering in 1951. In 1956, he joined the Research Institute for Electrical Energy as a senior research scientist.|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> something," [...] said Nat, with a sigh, as Franz {{leaned over}} the sofa, and softly stroked Aunt Jo's hot forehead.|$|E
6000|$|... "The others {{told me you}} had a headache. I'm {{very sorry}} to hear that. I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} {{to make you feel}} better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was <b>wishing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} pleasant {{this fine}} day; something very new and interesting, for the wind {{makes me feel}} frisky and gay." ...|$|R
5000|$|On his 2016 album Top of the Line, in {{the song}} of the same name, Rittz {{references}} Nardwuar with the lyric [...] "shit I can't recall the last 15 years <b>wishing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> an interview with Nardwuar".|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] replied Jimmy. [...] "I never {{waste time}} <b>wishing</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> things {{it was never}} meant I should do. It's funny where Old Mr. Toad is. He {{said that he was}} coming down here to sing, and Redwing the Blackbird seemed to be expecting him. I've looked {{everywhere}} I can think of without finding him, but I don't believe in giving up without another try. Stop your dreaming and come help us hunt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{she said}} in an {{undertone}} of intimacy. [...] "Genius.... A great irresponsible genius.... Difficult to help.... I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> more for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, many a time I've {{looked at}} people smoking, and thought well I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> that; but I never thought I could," [...] said Tom.|$|E
6000|$|... "I see." [...] The {{former teacher}} of Oak Hall gritted his teeth. [...] "Oh, how I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} to punish Porter and those others!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be <b>doing</b> something, sir. Everyone {{else had}} some duty, from {{yourself}} {{down to the}} black firemen--even my servant made himself useful, in carrying up shot." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor thing!" [...] said Mrs. Furnival. [...] "I <b>wish</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} for her." [...] And {{in this way}} they talked the matter over very comfortably.|$|R
6000|$|... "Aha! ... If {{that red}} devil has any love in him I'll never get it. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> {{so much for}} him. But always when he sees me he'll remember." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No Sally; it's not my secret. I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> something--help them somehow. Yes, it's sure {{a terrible}} mix. I don't {{care so much}} about myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's an outrage! Oh, Sam, I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> something!" [...] And {{unable to}} control his feelings, Tom clenched his hands and began to pace the floor.|$|E
6000|$|... "O Matildy, I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} for you! I {{want to help}} you so. I feel so bad that I didn't come before. Ain't they somethin'?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ever <b>do</b> {{anything}} that would be what you call kind--that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ever be of the slightest service to you I fear I shall never have the opportunity." [...] Will spoke with fervor.|$|R
5000|$|However, she was {{ultimately}} {{disappointed with the}} way the book turned out. [...] "In my heart," [...] she wrote, [...] "I know I have made a failure of it... <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>done</b> better with the brilliant plot.".|$|R
60|$|But {{she was on}} my {{mind and}} Tom was on my mind, so I slept very restless. And twice I went down the rod away in the night, and slipped around front, and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her eyes towards {{the road and the}} tears in them; and <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} for her, but I couldn't, only to swear that I wouldn't never do nothing to grieve her any more. And the third time I waked up at dawn, and slid down, and she was there yet, and her candle was most out, and her old gray head was resting on her hand, and she was asleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know how}} you feel," [...] he said, [...] "and I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> so; but I can't make an {{exception}} in your favor without offending the Parkers." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you please}} let me do {{something}} in the house, ma'am?" [...] And {{after a few moments}} she added, [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> something, and--and be your servant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} can say {{anything}} you choose to me," [...] he answered, smiling. [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> something {{to show you how}} grateful I am to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mamma {{is always}} good," [...] said Lily. [...] "I <b>wish,</b> mamma, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{the same for}} you oftener," [...] and then she kissed her mother. But the squire was exact about dinner, so they dressed {{themselves}} in haste, and went off again through the garden, their mother accompanying them to the little bridge.|$|R
6000|$|... "Our voyage {{is nearly}} over, my poor lad," [...] {{he said in}} Spanish, [...] "and your {{troubles}} now will be worse than mine. You have given me many {{a drink of water}} from your scanty supply, and <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> something for you in return; but I know that you do not even understand what I say to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Poor boy!" [...] murmured the doctor's son. [...] "He didn't {{look as if}} he {{was used}} to this hard life. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> we <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} for him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They are {{on their}} way out West, and I suppose they ran up here to see the sights. I--I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} to 'em!" [...] added Nat, bitterly.|$|E
60|$|I am glad {{it happens}} to be in my power so far to {{accommodate}} my Israelite, and only <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> as much {{for the rest of the}} Twelve Tribes.|$|E
6000|$|... "The more I see of America," [...] sighed Archie, [...] "the more it amazes me. All you birds seem to {{have been}} doing things from the cradle upwards. I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> things!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>do</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> only <b>do</b> {{more for}} you," [...] said Miss Ruey. [...] "I don't {{seem to get}} {{reconciled}} no ways; it seems dreffle hard--dreffle; but I'm glad you can feel so;" [...] and the good old soul proceeded to press upon the child not only the tea, which she drank with feverish relish, but every hoarded dainty which their limited housekeeping commanded.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Locker {{took off}} his hat, and rubbed his head. [...] "No," [...] said he, [...] "I didn't; but <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> say <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> But that's impossible. I presume I am right in {{assuming}} this impossibility?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! but I {{have seen}} {{specimens}} of the inhabitants," [...] answered the Duchess, vaguely. [...] "I must confess {{that most of}} them are extremely pretty. And they dress well, too. They get all their dresses in Paris. <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> afford to <b>do</b> the same." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How I do <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> {{anything}} to help you to the year at C---—. Mother has always said that she will {{let me try to}} publish 'Hart's- tongue Well' when I am twenty-one!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> you, {{or any of}} you, a greater,' said Miss La Creevy; 'but {{the power}} to serve, is as seldom joined with the will, as the will is with the power, I think.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are heartily welcome," [...] {{the driver}} said, {{mounting}} his box. [...] "I <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> as well every day; {{but these are}} bad times for us, and money is precious scarce, I can tell you." ...|$|E
5000|$|Every day at {{the studio}} it was a lottery as to who would turn up and what - if any - {{positive}} contribution they would make when they did. Keith would arrive with anywhere up to ten people, Brian with another half-a-dozen {{and it was the}} same for Mick. They were assorted girlfriends and friends. I hated it! Then again, so did Andrew (Oldham) and just gave up on it. There were times when <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>done,</b> too.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Dear Mrs. Wright, don't cry!' she whispered, and {{her little}} white hand passed in a soothing, hesitating gesture over the coil of rich {{chestnut}} hair. 'Don't cry! I am afraid you have suffered. Oh, how <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> help you! <b>Do</b> tell me how I can help you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your <b>wish</b> that <b>I</b> {{should go}} with him is a great compliment, and <b>I</b> {{thoroughly}} <b>wish</b> that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> it. As it is, I must go to Killaloe and retrieve my finances. I daresay, Lady Laura, you can hardly conceive how very poor a man I am." [...] There was a melancholy tone about his voice as he said this, which made her think for the moment whether or no he had been right in going into Parliament, and whether she had been right in instigating him to do so. But {{it was too late}} to recur to that question now.|$|R
