500|$|Barrymore {{had always}} professed a dislike of the acting profession, but in 1900 he was persuaded {{by his father}} to join him on stage for a few {{performances}} of a short play, [...] "A Man of the World". He appeared in the same piece again the following year, but he still thought of the experience as merely a way to supplement his income, {{rather than as a}} possible future career. In October 1901, Ethel was appearing in Philadelphia in Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines when one of the younger actors became temporarily unavailable. She persuaded the director to allow Barrymore to accept the part of the minor character, and Barrymore traveled from New York, learning his lines on the train. In the first act, he stopped {{in the middle of his}} dialogue, unable to remember the text, and asked the audience and his fellow actors, [...] "I've blown up. <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> here?", which led the cast to improvise the remainder of the scene.|$|E
500|$|On February 15 {{the session}} began at 6p.m. but Dylan simply {{sat in the}} studio working on his lyrics while the musicians played cards, napped and chatted. Finally, at 4a.m., Dylan called the musicians in and {{outlined}} {{the structure of the}} song. Dylan counted off and the musicians fell in, as he attempted his epic composition [...] "Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands". Kenny Buttrey recalled, [...] "If you notice that record, that thing after like the second chorus starts building and building like crazy, and everybody's just peaking it up 'cause we thought, Man, this is it... This is gonna be the last chorus and we've gotta put everything into it we can. And he played another harmonica solo and went back down to another verse and the dynamics had to drop back down to a verse kind of feel... After about ten minutes of this thing we're cracking up at each other, at what we were doing. I mean, we peaked five minutes ago. <b>Where</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> here?" [...] The finished song clocked in at 11 minutes, 23 seconds, and would occupy the entire fourth side of the album.|$|E
500|$|... "Four Rusted Horses" [...] is a blues-inspired rock song, and was {{compared}} {{to the work of}} The Doors and Johnny Cash. Manson described its lyric as being [...] "almost a nursery rhyme. [...] everyone thinks that I was singing about the apocalypse, but it's more just about the four of us, my band, that managed to survive through all of this, and <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> here." [...] "Arma-goddamn-motherfuckin-geddon" [...] is an uptempo rock song which was described by The Quietus as [...] "classic Manson". Caren Gibson of Metal Hammer claimed that the song was reminiscent of [...] "Chain Reaction" [...] by Diana Ross, as well as the work of Depeche Mode. [...] "Blank and White" [...] deals with censorship, specifically the reaction to Time magazine's cover story [...] "Is God Dead?", which saw protesters brandishing blank picket signs. The lyric [...] "God is dead but god is still white / So shoot up the mall, the school or the president of whatever / Or whoever wants a fight" [...] was censored by Interscope on all editions of the album. Manson has said that this made him happy artistically, as [...] "the song is about censorship, and they censored [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|The song {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said {{the song was}} one of several on parent album Graffiti that [...] "flirt with a public apology." [...] Kot went on to state that a [...] "funeral organ" [...] hovers over the song, and [...] "the narrator longs for a second chance: [...] "'So <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> here/With all of this fear in your eyes?'" [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said that both [...] "Crawl" [...] and another song from Graffiti, [...] "So Cold", come off as [...] "thoughtful, even if they're not quite mea culpas" [...] and further suggested that [...] "In these moments Mr. Brown is pining, mildly apologetic." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "genuinely affecting second single", and stated that [...] "Less forgiving listeners" [...] looking for [...] "signs of contrition" [...] may find them on the track. Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK said that, of the six tracks on the album's deluxe edition that could be interpreted as dealing with Brown's relationship with Rihanna directly, [...] "Crawl" [...] is [...] "by far the most catchily contrite." [...] Rap-Up said that the song shows Brown [...] "taking baby steps back to love and into the spotlight," [...] and said that it found Brown [...] "longing to mend a broken relationship" [...] as in his 2008 Jordin Sparks collaboration, “No Air”.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{celebrations}} in the West Bank and led Gaza Strip {{with people}} waving the Fatah and Hamas flags, respectively. Salam Fayyad {{said after the}} vote, {{for which he was}} in New York: [...] "The question is, <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> here and what does it mean? The sooner the tough rhetoric of this can subside and the more this is viewed as a logical consequence of many years of failure to move the process forward, the better;" [...] while he also called for more U.S. involvement in the peace process. PLO Executive Committee member Saeb Erekat added: [...] "Life will not be the same [...] Palestine will become a country under occupation. The terms of reference for any negotiations become withdrawal." ...|$|E

He called for expanded education about the residential school system and said [...] "this is a moment for national reflection and introspection... {{to think about the}} depth of our commitment to tolerance, respect and inclusiveness, and whether we can do better. This is a moment to think about those people — those children, those mothers and fathers, those families and those elders, past and present. And it's also a moment to ask: <b>where</b> <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>go</b> <b>from</b> here?" ...|$|E

"The ‘People’s Charter’ is {{an attempt}} to build a {{stronger}} liberal and secular republican democratic framework in a multi-ethnic state that continues to be dominated by an ethno-Fijian nationalism. [...] The hardline pursuit of ethno-nationalist policies during the five years that the SDL and Conservative Alliance–Matanitu Vanua (CAMV) were in power sharpened conflicts within the indigenous Fijian community [...] The draft People’s Charter {{is an attempt}} to further reform our liberal/republican state so that the exclusivist tendency of indigenous ethno-nationalism is moderated and reoriented towards a broader concept of a multicultural, multi-ethnic nation state that stresses the civic principles of the nation as the regulator of political discourse and other interactions, thus contributing to the stability needed for overall national development. [...] While, in the last 18 months, the opposition to the interim government has not presented a coherent alternative for the way forward to the people of Fiji, there has at least been a concession that the draft People’s Charter advances ‘noble principles’ they cannot disagree with. They only disagree {{with the fact that the}} draft People’s Charter has been initiated by a regime they regard as illegal and illegitimate.
