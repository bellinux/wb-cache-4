5|$|Bradman rested {{himself for}} the next match against Cambridge University, leaving Hassett to orchestrate another innings victory. Bradman {{returned}} for the following match against Essex, and batted first after winnings the toss. Bill Brown opened with Barnes and they put on 145 in 97 minutes before Barnes hit his own wicket and <b>was</b> <b>out.</b> Bradman came in and seized the initiative, reaching 42 in the 20 minutes before lunch, including five fours from one over by Frank Vigar which subsequently entered Essex club folklore, as Australia passed 200. Bradman and Brown put on a second-wicket partnership of 219 in 90 minutes before Brown <b>was</b> <b>out</b> for 153 from three hours of batting, with the score at 2/364. After Miller fell without scoring on the next ball, Ron Hamence joined Bradman and they put on another 88 before the Australian skipper <b>was</b> <b>out</b> for 187 at 4/452. Bradman had added his last 87 runs in 48 minutes, hitting a total of 32 fours. Australia <b>was</b> <b>out</b> for 721 at stumps, setting a world record for the most runs in a single day's play in first-class cricket; the record still stands. The tourists completed victory by an innings and 451 runs, their biggest winning margin for the tour. Bradman rested {{himself for the}} next match against Oxford University, which resulted in another innings victory.|$|E
5|$|David Bell, the Home Office negotiator, kept contradicting himself, {{as if in}} a bid {{to prolong}} the negotiations. He would agree to our terms, then he would try and tell us it <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of his hands, and go back on his word. If it <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of the Home Officer's hands—then whose hands was it in? I think the final stages were messed around by the Home Office so that our protest could help to divert the public's {{attention}} from the Poll Tax revolt that was going on throughout the country. As Alan Lord was snatched after being asked to negotiate on behalf of us all, this made us all more defiant about ending the protest.|$|E
5000|$|Suppose that Carr <b>is</b> <b>out.</b> If Carr <b>is</b> <b>out,</b> then if Allen <b>is</b> also <b>out</b> Brown {{would have}} to be in, since someone must be in the shop for it to be open. However, we know that {{whenever}} Allen goes out he takes Brown with him, and thus we know as a general rule that if Allen <b>is</b> <b>out,</b> Brown <b>is</b> <b>out.</b> So if Carr <b>is</b> <b>out</b> then the statements [...] "if Allen <b>is</b> <b>out</b> then Brown <b>is</b> in" [...] and [...] "if Allen <b>is</b> <b>out</b> then Brown <b>is</b> out" [...] would both be true at the same time.|$|R

5|$|During his {{breeding}} career, Joe Daniels sired two stakes winning horses: Hidalgo and Hoodlum. Hidalgo <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of Electra, {{a daughter}} of American Eclipse.

5|$|In {{the third}} Test, too, Ring's batting made more impact than his bowling. A wet pitch led to 22 wickets {{falling on the}} first day, and {{temporary}} Australian captain Arthur Morris rejigged his batting order {{at the end of}} the day, opening the second innings with Ian Johnson and Gil Langley, sending Geff Noblet in when Johnson <b>was</b> <b>out</b> and then Ring as a second nightwatchman when Noblet <b>was</b> <b>out.</b> Ring lasted into the second day when conditions were easier, and top-scored for the Australian team with 67, which remained his best score in Tests. He took three of the four wickets that fell as West Indies successfully chased a target of 233 on Christmas Day.|$|E

5000|$|However, {{the correct}} {{conclusion}} {{to draw from}} the incompatibility of the two [...] "hypotheticals" [...] is that what is hypothesised in them (that Allen <b>is</b> <b>out)</b> must <b>be</b> false under our assumption that Carr <b>is</b> <b>out.</b> Then our logic simply allows us {{to arrive at the}} conclusion [...] "If Carr <b>is</b> <b>out,</b> then Allen must necessarily be in".|$|R

5|$|After {{entering}} service, Nautilus and Albatross alternated between {{service with}} the High Seas Fleet; Nautilus {{participated in the}} annual fleet maneuvers in 1907 and 1908, {{and was replaced by}} Albatross thereafter. Nautilus was modernized at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Kiel in 190910, and Albatross underwent a similar modernization there in 191011. While Albatross <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of service, Nautilus temporarily returned to the fleet. Once the former's refit was completed in 1911, the latter was transferred to mine warfare training in the North Sea before being decommissioned {{at the end of the}} year. Albatross remained in service through 1914, but apart from a collision with the steamer , the time passed uneventfully.|$|E

His success did not abate. A Ju 88 and Do 217 were claimed off the English coast on the nights of the 26 and 31 October 1942.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} ESRO program was initiated, the agency moved towards {{satellites}} {{with a higher}} orbital eccentricity and escape orbits. The facilities in Ny-Ålesund were unsuitable for telemetry with such satellites, as they would operate at a different frequency, {{the size of the}} antenna dish was too small and the ground station's geographical position <b>was</b> <b>out</b> of range. Because of the change of ESRO's focus, the need for a telemetry station on Svalbard disappeared after the termination of ESRO's initial program, and the facility was closed in 1974.|$|E
