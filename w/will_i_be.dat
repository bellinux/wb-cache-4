According to Ahn, an anonymous message {{was sent to}} Kyungnam University where he worked, alleging that he [...] "had sex with two underage girls".

Ahn wrote that In Internet forums I was called a [...] "violent pornographer," [...] a 'child molester,' and a 'serial rapist.' I began receiving hate mail.

500|$|Orville {{followed}} his brother's success by demonstrating another nearly identical Flyer to the United States Army at Fort Myer, Virginia, starting on September 3, 1908. On September 9, {{he made the}} first hour-long flight, lasting 62 minutes and 15 seconds. On September 17, Army lieutenant Thomas Selfridge rode along as his passenger, serving as an official observer. A few minutes into the flight {{at an altitude of}} about , a propeller split and shattered, sending the Flyer out of control. Selfridge suffered a fractured skull in the crash and died that evening in the nearby Army hospital, becoming the first airplane crash fatality. Orville was badly injured, suffering a broken left leg and four broken ribs. Twelve years later, after he suffered increasingly severe pains, X-rays revealed the accident had also caused three hip bone fractures and a dislocated hip. The brothers' sister Katharine, a school teacher, rushed from Dayton to Virginia and stayed by Orville's side for the seven weeks of his hospitalization. She helped negotiate a one-year extension of the Army contract. A friend visiting Orville in the hospital asked, [...] "Has it got your nerve?" [...] "Nerve?" [...] repeated Orville, slightly puzzled. [...] "Oh, do you mean <b>will</b> <b>I</b> <b>be</b> afraid to fly again?
