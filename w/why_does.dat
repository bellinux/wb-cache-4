25|$|The last of {{the four}} films Fassbinder shot in 1969, was his first in color, <b>Why</b> <b>Does</b> Herr R. Run Amok? (Warum läuft Herr R. Amok?). It was co-directed by Michael Fengler (the friend who had been his {{cameraman}} on the short film The little Chaos in 1967). Only {{the outlines of the}} scenes were sketched by Fassbinder. Fengler and the cast then improvised the dialogue. Fassbinder asserted that this was really Fengler's work rather than his. Nevertheless, the two were jointly given a directorial award for the project in the 1971 German Film prize competition and <b>Why</b> <b>Does</b> Herr R. Run Amok? has always been considered among Fassbinder's films.|$|E

25|$|This {{raises the}} {{question}} <b>why</b> <b>does</b> an employer ever do {{more than it is}} legally obliged to do ? One theory seeking to explain this behaviour is that employment {{is an example of a}} relational contract, based upon a relationship of trust between the parties. The explicit terms of the contract are just an outline as there are implicit terms and understandings which determine the behaviour of the parties. The High Court has long held there is a distinction between the employment relationship and the contract of employment.|$|E
25|$|Foote's {{substantive}} commentary in the Burns film {{dealt with}} a wide variety of battles, characters military and civilian, and issues. He also explained a puzzling question on nomenclature: <b>why</b> <b>does</b> the same battle often have two names? Foote's answer: Northerners are usually from cities, so rivers and streams are noteworthy; whereas Southerners are usually rural, so they find towns noteworthy. Some examples are the First and Second Battles of Bull Run, known as First and Second Manassas, and the Battle of Antietam, also called the Battle of Sharpsburg.|$|E

Irritated by the incessant chat between his wife and her friend while he tries to watch T.V, Herr Raab kills the neighbor with {{a blow to the}} head with a candle stick and then kills both his wife and their son. Herr Raab is later found hanged in an office restroom.|$|E

25|$|New New Trade Theory {{analyses}} individual {{enterprises and}} plants {{in an international}} competitive situation. The classical trade theory—i.e., the Heckscher–Ohlin model—has no enterprises in mind. The new trade theory treats enterprises in an industry as identical entities. New New Trade Theory gives focus on the diversity of enterprises. It {{is a fact that}} some enterprises engage in export and some that do not. Some enterprises invest directly in the foreign country in order to produce and sell in that country. Some other enterprises engage only in export. <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> this kind of differences occur? New New Trade Theory tries to find out the reasons of these well observed facts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Why</b> <b>does</b> the Court {{not apply}} this clear law to these clear facts, and conclude, as I do, that the funding scheme {{here is a}} clear {{constitutional}} violation? The answer must be, in part, that the Court fails to confront the evidence {{set out in the}} preceding section. Throughout its opinion, the Court refers uniformly to Wide Awakes Christian viewpoint or its religious perspective, and in distinguishing funding of Wide Awake from the funding of a church, the Court maintains that Wide Awake is not a religious institution, at least in the usual sense. The Court does not quote the magazine's adoption of Saint Paul's exhortation to awaken to the nearness of salvation, or any of its articles enjoining readers to accept Jesus Christ, or the religious verses, or the religious textual analyses, or the suggested prayers. And so, it is easy for the Court to lose sight of what the University students and the Court of Appeals found so obvious, and to blanch the patently and frankly evangelistic character of the magazine by unrevealing allusions to religious points of view.|$|E

[...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four.

500|$|... "Battlefield" [...] is a mid-tempo pop and R ballad. It also {{derives from}} the genres of pop rock and soft rock. The {{instrumentation}} of [...] "Battlefield" [...] consists of a bass, piano, drums, percussion and guitar. [...] "Battlefield" [...] is set in common time with a moderate tempo of 144 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of G major with Sparks' vocal range spanning from the note of A3 to C6. The song's lyrics revolve around [...] "a tumultuous relationship where neither side wants to compromise", as stated by Jocelyn Vena of MTV News. Nick Levine of Digital Spy noted that [...] "Battlefield" [...] {{is based on the}} [...] "love is war" [...] metaphor. During the chorus, Sparks sings: [...] "I never meant to start a war / You know, I never wanna hurt you / Don't even know what we're fighting for / <b>Why</b> <b>does</b> love always feel like a battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield." [...] Its bridge features the line: [...] "I guess you'd better go and get your armour".|$|E
500|$|In the Adhyatma Ramayana, while Tara wails {{over the}} death of Vali, Rama preaches to her, saying that the body is ephemeral, while only the soul is eternal; he tells her she should not grieve over the decay of Vali's body. Tara {{questions}} him asking [...] "if the body is destructible, <b>why</b> <b>does</b> one feel pleasure and pain". Rama informs her that due to ahamkara (egoism) the mind is chained in bondage to desires. He declares that Tara will remain untouched by karma and be emancipated from the bondage of life. Having heard his sermon, and because she had been devoted to him in a previous birth, Tara thus becomes free of egoism and undergoes self-realization. This discourse of Rama also appears in Tulsidas's Ramacharitamanasa, but it is curtailed to just two verses and is possibly borrowed from the former text. Rama says that the body is perishable, but the soul is immortal and listening to this, the enlightened Tara bows to Rama and gains the boon of supreme devotion.|$|E

She concluded by stating that: [...] "In fact, it seems that Lopez goes {{out of her way}} to sing with a little-girl inflection to her 41-year-old pipes. But it comes off youthful, upbeat, and a little lighter than the single [...] and her island-inflected collaboration with Lil Wayne, 'I'm Into You'." [...] Amos Barshad of Vulture questioned Lopez' music, stating that [...] "with the other facets of her multimedia empire clicking [...] <b>why</b> <b>does</b> she insist on continuing to make music?

[...] IGN's Chad Grischow described the song as a star-studded banger, and cited Jay-Z's verse as the most notable. In addition, Grischow stated that the song was unfocused. Chris Martins of Spin reported that much like the track [...] "Monster", the guest appearances on the song {{had the potential to}} be toned down. Chicago Sun-Times writer Thomas Conner cited the line [...] "praise due to the most high, Allah / Praise due to the most fly, Prada" [...] as an example of genius songwriting on West's part. The song charted at 14 on the Bubbling Under R/Hip-Hop Singles chart as reported by Billboard, however it only spent one week on the chart. The song also appeared on the South Korean Gaon Chart at number 95.|$|E
