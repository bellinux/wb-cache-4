3000|$|The {{first step}} in the test {{assembly}} is to determine the number of blocks and the assignment of items to those blocks. The function block_design facilitates this process with two required arguments and one optional argument. The n_blocks argument specifies the number of blocks while the item_parameters argument takes a data frame of item parameters. The default allocation of items to blocks is a spiraling design. For 1, 2, [...]..., H item blocks, the first item <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> block 1, item 2 <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> the block 2, and item H <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> block H.

The retailers falling {{between the first and second}} corresponding numbers to DCs (10, 11 and 12) will <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> DC 2. In this example, as number 11 comes right after number 12, no retailer <b>is</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> DC 2, i.e., DC 2 is not going to be established. Similarly, the retailers falling between the second and third corresponding numbers to DCs (10, 11 and 12) will <b>be</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> DC 3. In this case, retailers 8, 9, 7, and 6 <b>are</b> <b>assigned</b> <b>to</b> DC 3, with the same sequence of meeting the retailers.
