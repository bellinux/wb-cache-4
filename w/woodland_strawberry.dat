50|$|The {{strawberry}} {{was mentioned}} by ancient Romans, {{who thought it}} had medicinal properties, but it was then not a staple of agriculture. <b>Woodland</b> <b>strawberries</b> began to be grown in French gardens in the 14th century. The musky-flavored strawberry (F. moschata) began to be grown in European gardens in the late 16th century. Later, the Virginia strawberry was grown in Europe and the United States. The most commonly consumed strawberry, the garden strawberry (F. ananassa), is an accidental hybrid of the Virginia strawberry and a Chilean variety Fragaria chiloensis. It was first noted by a French gardener around the mid 18th century that, when F. moschata and F. virginiana were planted in between rows of F. chiloensis, the Chilean strawberry would bear abundant and unusually large fruits. Soon after, Antoine Nicolas Duchesne began to study the breeding of strawberries and made several discoveries crucial to the science of plant breeding, such as the sexual reproduction of strawberry. Later, in the early 1800s, English breeders of strawberry made varieties of F. ananassa which were important in strawberry breeding in Europe, and hundreds of cultivars have since been produced through the breeding of strawberries.|$|R

Mechanical injury, in fact, occurs at all stages, from pre-harvest operations through post-harvest handling, packing and transport to the market. The main implications of this damage are {{the reduction of the}} product’s quality and economical losses related to the shelf life diminution. For most perishable products, the shelf life is relatively short and it is typically dictated by microbial growth related to the application of dynamic and static loads during transportation. This paper presents the correlation between vibration levels and microbiological growth on <b>strawberries</b> and <b>woodland</b> <b>strawberries</b> and detects the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in order to develop an intelligent logistic unit capable of monitoring VOCs using a specific sensor system. Fresh fruits were exposed to vibrations by means of a vibrating table in a temperature-controlled environment.

40|$|Bioenergy {{forestry}} is {{a viable}} alternative to fossil fuels, providing a mean to reduce net carbon emissions and thus our impact on climate change. It is therefore important that bioenergy production is not hampered by herbivory. If plants with certain traits can be chosen to maximize biological control, bioenergy forestry can become an even more potent and sustainable practice. The aim of my project is to investigate what effects sex in a bioenergy crop has on multitrophic interactions and pollinator attraction. Plant sex effects will be investigated using the dioecious Salix viminalis (Salicaceae), commonly grown in plantations in Sweden, Germany, Denmark, Great Britain and a few more European countries. The project will describe how plant sex affects ecosystem services provided by this crop (biological control and pollination), and through that the potential to increase these ecosystem services through selecting or combining clones of either sex. While the results will be easily applied knowledge, my project will also expand our general knowledge of plant sex effects; multitrophic interactions between plants and insects and among insects are barely described. Insect species under study will be a herbivorous beetle (Phratora vulgatissima, Coleoptera), an omnivorous predatory bug (Anthocoris nemorum, Hemiptera), and a parasitoid wasp (Perilitus brevicollis, Hymenoptera). I will use these species in a series of field- and laboratory based experiments. In addition, plant sex effects on pollinator attraction will be tested in the field experiments through observing flower visitation rates and recording berry production in adjacent <b>woodland</b> <b>strawberries,</b> Fragaria vesca.

40|$|According to the {{external}} coincidence model, photoperiodic flowering occurs when CONSTANS (CO) mRNA expression coincides with light in the afternoon of long days (LDs), leading to the activation of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). CO has evolved in Brassicaceae from other Group Ia CO-like (COL) proteins which do not control photoperiodic flowering in Arabidopsis. COLs in other species have evolved different functions as floral activators or even as repressors. To understand photoperiodic development in the perennial rosaceous model species <b>woodland</b> <b>strawberry,</b> we functionally characterized FvCO, the only Group Ia COL in its genome. We demonstrate that FvCO has {{a major role in}} the photoperiodic control of flowering and vegetative reproduction through runners. FvCO is needed to generate a bimodal rhythm of FvFT 1 which encodes a floral activator in the LD accession Hawaii- 4 : a sharp FvCO expression peak at dawn is followed by the FvFT 1 morning peak in LDs indicating possible direct regulation, but additional factors that may include FvGI and FvFKF 1 are probably needed to schedule the second FvFT 1 peak around dusk. These results demonstrate that although FvCO and FvFT 1 play major roles in photoperiodic development, the CO-based external coincidence around dusk is not fully applicable to the <b>woodland</b> <b>strawberry.</b> [Abstract copyright: © The Author 2017.

40|$|Of {{the most}} {{commonly}} consumed berries, strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) {{are the most popular}} choice with consumers, being eaten both fresh and frozen, as well as in different processed products. Although the composition of strawberry fruit has been extensively studied, especially for the most abundant phenolic compounds, ellagitannins and in detail agrimoniin has been only recently univocally identified {{as one of the most}} abundant phenolic compounds in strawberry (Vrhovsek et al. 2012). This class of natural polyphenols recently gained much attention in light of the experimental evidence of their anticancer activities, antiproliferative properties, and antibacterial activity on intestinal pathogens. Furthermore agrimoniin is a known bioactive compound, which has been used for treatment of diarrhea and haemorrhaging and reported to have antitumor properties. Its presence as the main ellagitannin in both strawberry and <b>woodland</b> <b>strawberry</b> fruit is therefore noticeable. Of fruit containing ellagitannins, strawberries are the most widely consumed, and agrimoniin is suggested to be one of the most widely present ellagitannin in the human diet (manuscript in preparation) The establishment of an HPLC protocol for the separation of the ellagitannins (Gasperotti et al. 2010), and the isolation and characterisation of the main ellagitannins and ellagic acid derivatives, allowed us an accurate quantification of ellagitannins and ellagic acid conjugates in 6 different varieties of strawberry and in 2 <b>woodland</b> <b>strawberry.</b> The structural characterization was obtained by QTOF-HDMS in order to discriminate the different oligomeric form or the differences between the ellagitannins with similar building block units. The presence of 23 ellagitannins and 3 ellagic acid conjugates in the strawberry extracts was confirmed among the strawberry cultivars and <b>woodland</b> <b>strawberry</b> types. Woodland strawberries were the richest in terms of absolute concentration of ellagitannins and number of ellagitannins. Beside that, different cultivars of strawberries differ significantly in the amount and also profiles of ellagitannins. These data give evidence that more precise information about the fruit composition in term of their nutritional relevance needs to be taken into account in food metabolomics studies and their application to nutritional research. The attention of the consumer needs to be moved in the direction of the consumption of more nutritional relevant cultivar. Agrimoniin, together with the other strawberry ellagitannins and ellagic acid derivatives characterised in this study, deserve further attention since they are expected to play an important, yet still largely unexplored, role in the relationship between healthy effects and the consumption of strawberries in humans.

40|$|Cultivating {{well-developed}} and marketable garden strawberries (Fragria x ananassa) and woodland strawberries (Fragaria vesca) {{depends on}} successful pollination by insects. Organic garden strawberry plantations harbour higher pollinator densities {{and have been}} shown to produce bigger and better developed fruits than conventional farms. However, organic cultivators sometimes face severe problems from herbivory by leaf beetles that forage on both leaves and flowers. This study aims to investigate how the damage on <b>woodland</b> <b>strawberry</b> by leaf beetle herbivores (Galerucella tenella and G. sagittariae) affect 1) the pollinators’ response to damaged vs. undamaged flowers, 2) pollination success, fruit weight and fruit development and 3) the production of flowers and runners. Two different plant types of <b>woodland</b> <b>strawberry</b> were used; the commercial variety Rügen were herbivore damage was focused on the flowers and wild genotypes that received herbivory on both leaves and flowers. Pollinators (bees and hover flies) clearly preferred undamaged flowers and {{there was no significant difference}} between pollinator groups. Both plant types had a higher pollination success in undamaged flowers compared to damaged ones but it was only significant in the Rügen plants. Rügen plants produced lighter fruits after florivory but there was no obvious effect on fruit weight after herbivory and florivory in the wild genotypes. There were less deformations from undamaged control flowers in Rügen plants but none of the plant types showed any significant effects of herbivory on the number of deformations. Hand pollination was done on at least one flower of each plant in both plant types to control that damage by herbivores caused lower pollination rather than direct damages that caused a lower weight or more deformations. Hand pollination caused an increase in weight for Rügen plants and decrease of deformations for both plant types, suggesting that pollen was limited. The number of runners produced during the experiment decreased with herbivory-damage while the number of produced flowers was unaffected by damage. To establish a more reliable way to cultivate woodland strawberries without pesticides it could be advantageous to further investigate the plants’ inherent defence to herbivores.

Analysis of wild populations of A. thaliana has shed light on several important developmental pathways controlling, for example, flowering time and plant growth, suggesting that a similar approach using F. vesca might add to our understanding on the development of rosaceous species and perennials in general.
