He was accompanied by friars Antonio Pérez de San Román, Joseph de Jesús María and Diego de Echevarría, and by lay brother Lucas de San Francisco; some of these he collected on his journey south along the Camino Real. On 5 January they caught up with and passed the main contingent of the army at B'atkab', continuing to Chuntuki. From Chuntuki they followed an Indian trail that led them past the source of the San Pedro River and across steep karst hills to a <b>watering</b> <b>hole</b> by some ruins, which was recorded as Tanxulukmul by Avendaño. From Tanxulukmul they followed the small Acté River to a Chak'an Itza town called Saklemakal. They arrived at the western end of Lake Petén Itzá to an enthusiastic welcome by the local Itza.|$|E

The following day, the current Aj Kan Ek' travelled across the lake with eighty canoes to greet the visitors at the Chak'an Itza port town of Nich, on the west shore of Lake Petén Itza. The Franciscans returned to Nojpetén with Kan Ek' and baptised over 300 Itza children over the following four days. Avendaño tried to convince Kan Ek' to convert to Christianity and surrender to the Spanish Crown, without success. The king of the Itza, cited Itza prophecy and said the time was not yet right.|$|E
5|$|The {{black mamba}} is diurnal and chiefly an ambush predator, {{though it has}} been {{recorded}} as hunting partly by pursuit, such as catching pigeons at a <b>watering</b> <b>hole</b> before they can fly high enough to escape. It usually goes hunting from a permanent lair, to which it will regularly return, if the hunting is good {{and it is not}} disturbed. It hunts mainly by sight and in doing so it commonly will raise much of its length well off the ground. The black mamba does not typically hold onto prey after biting, instead releasing its quarry and waiting for it to succumb to paralysis and die. This however depends on the type of prey; for example, it typically will hold onto a bird till it stops struggling to escape. If prey tries to escape or defend itself, the black mamba often may follow up its initial bite with a rapid series of strikes to incapacitate and quickly kill its prey. The snake has been known to prey on hyrax and rock hyrax, bushbabies, and bats. The black mamba has a potent digestive system and has been observed to digest prey fully within eight to ten hours.|$|E

25|$|On 26 November, {{the first}} 32 Battalion platoon {{observed}} six PLAN guerrillas at a <b>watering</b> <b>hole</b> {{on the edge}} of Chana Onaimbungu. This was three kilometres south of the border and well within South West African territory. The South Africans deployed into a sweep line and advanced to within fifty metres of the unsuspecting militants before opening fire. The cadre made no attempt to resist, but fled towards the western bush. In their haste they inadvertently collided with a second platoon to the northwest less than an hour later. All guerrillas were killed when they entered the South Africans' camp. Both platoon leaders made contact and agreed that they had probably encountered the same cadre.|$|E

Continuing along the path, is the lion enclosure which is home to four female lions. The Pridelands area of the zoo also features Greater flamingos, Hamadryas baboons, two cheetah brothers and servals. An African themed cafe named 'The Watering Hole', is located in this precinct next to the lions and flamingos.|$|E

25|$|The Wilds of Africa Adventure Safari is a 20-minute, one-mile, narrated {{monorail}} ride, which travels {{around the}} <b>watering</b> <b>hole</b> (hippopotamus) rain forest (okapi), mountain (Nubian ibex), woodlands (Grévy's zebra), river (waterbuck, greate white pallicans, Goliath herons, blue cranes), arid desert (scimitar-horned oryx, addra gazelle), semi-arid desert (addax, gemsbok, ostrich) and bush (gerenuk, red-crowned cranes, greater kudu, Thomson's gazelle, marabou storks) exhibits. The monorail features aerial {{views of the}} Simmons Hippo Outpost, Chimpanzee Forest, Nile crocodile, and Penguin Cove exhibits, which are also accessible via the Nature Trail. The monorail originally opened in 1990 but {{after two decades of}} use and over a million passengers, the attraction began to show its age with aging infrastructure and several electrical outages that left passengers stranded on the tour. The final incident in August 2014 prompted zoo officials to shut down the attraction for evaluation. Following the evaluation the DZS decided a $3 million renovation was in order. On March 25, 2016, the Monorail Safari reopened as the Wilds of Africa Adventure Safari featuring a new sound system, an upgraded station, air-conditioning, upgraded mechanical and electrical components and new graphics on the individual cars. Additionally, a diesel powered tug is now on standby to nudge the trains back to the station {{in the event of a}} power failure.|$|E

500|$|The {{constitutionality}} {{of the new law}} was disputed. [...] Up until then, feral horses and burros were considered to be under the jurisdiction of State estray laws, and managed as unclaimed livestock that the Federal government had no right to interfere with. [...] To test this assertion, in 1974 the New Mexico Livestock Board seized 19 free-roaming feral burros which were preventing cattle from using a <b>watering</b> <b>hole</b> on federal land. The United States District Court for the District of New Mexico held that, under the , Congress could regulate [...] "wild" [...] animals only to protect public land from damage. [...] The case went to the Supreme Court of the United States. In Kleppe v. New Mexico, 426 U.S. 529 (1976), the Supreme Court ruled that Congress's power to manage public land [...] "necessarily includes the power to regulate and protect the wildlife living there." [...] and that, unclaimed free-roaming horses could be considered [...] "wildlife" [...] for purposes of determining whether Congress has the power to protect them. In United States v. Johnson, 685 F.2d 337 (9th Cir. 1982) the act was challenged in court for being unconstitutionally vague and unconstitutionally overbroad in its definition of [...] "unbranded and unclaimed horses".

2500|$|Other {{researchers}} such as Randolph Nesse {{have proposed}} that grief {{is a kind of}} psychological pain that orients the sufferer to a new existence without the deceased and creates a painful but instructive memory. If, for example, leaving an offspring alone at a <b>watering</b> <b>hole</b> led to the offspring’s death, grief creates an intensively painful memory of the event, dissuading a parent from ever again leaving an offspring alone at a <b>watering</b> <b>hole.</b> [...] More recently, Winegard, Reynolds, Winegard, Baumeister, and Maner argued that grief might be a socially selected signal of an individual’s propensity for forming strong, committed relationships. From this social signaling perspective, grief targets old and new social partners, informing them that the griever is capable of forming strong social commitments. That is, because grief signals a person's capacity to form strong and faithful social bonds, those who displayed prolonged grief responses were preferentially chosen by alliance partners. The authors argue that throughout human evolution, grief was therefore shaped and elaborated by the social decisions of selective alliance partners.|$|E

2500|$|The Warndarang people {{classified}} {{themselves into}} four patrilineal semimoieties used in ritual settings: mambali, muruŋun, wuʈal, and guyal (wuyal).

Each semimoiety was associated with a particular <b>watering</b> <b>hole</b> and animal totems (for example, muruŋun had the totem ŋarugalin, [...] "dugong [...] "), though anybody could drink from the watering holes and a person was permitted to consume his or her totem.

40|$|Abstract: Selected {{wildlife}} species diurnal use of {{a natural}} <b>water</b> <b>hole</b> (QO) and an artificial <b>water</b> <b>hole</b> (AW) were studied during 1990 dry season at Guanacaste Conservation Area, Costa Rica. In total, 9 19 individuals (six marnmal and one garne bird species) consumed water from QO, while 713 individuals (four maromal species) consumed water from AW. Estimated daily water consumption by selected wildlife species was 29. 7 I at O. D and 27. 3 I at AW. Estimated 2 4 -h water consumed by all wildlife species or evaporated was 44. 6 1 at QO and 41. 1 1 at AW. This resulted from summing: a) water consumed by studied species, b) estimated 24 -hour water consurned by other wildlife (QO = 14. 85 1, AW = 13. 65 1) and c) daily water evaporation (QO = 0. 04 1, AW = 0. 10 1).
