5|$|Gary {{uses the}} novel {{as a vehicle to}} {{denounce}} both racism and the activists supporting African-American rights, including his own ex-wife and Marlon Brando. He also examines whether human responses to situations, including racism, are learned social behavior and <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be unlearned. In 1981, it was adapted into the controversial film of the same name, in which director Samuel Fuller made various changes to the novel's story to focus more on the dog and present a more pessimistic ending than the original novel. The film's American release after negative press from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) led to concerns of boycotts.|$|E
5|$|Morphologically, {{the dark}} colour of the gills and stem, {{lack of a}} strong taste, and {{characters}} of the cystidia (large cells found on the mushrooms) are the most distinguishing characteristics of X.setulipes. These features allow the species to be readily distinguished from other, similar species, including X.cauticinalis and X.brunneola. Its ecology and habitat are also distinct, but it is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> serve as certain identifying characteristics. Within the genus Xeromphalina, X.setulipes is classified in the section Mutabiles, along with several other species. It seems most closely related to X.fraxinophila, X.cornui, X.campanelloides and X.cauticinalis, but, according to Esteve-Raventós and colleagues, further analysis is required to accurately judge {{the relationships between the}} species of Xeromphalina.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in the fictional {{floating}} world of Cocoon, whose government, the Sanctum, is ordering a purge of civilians who have supposedly come into contact with Pulse, the much-feared world below. The former soldier Lightning begins her fight against the government in order to save her sister who has been branded as an unwilling servant to a god-like being from Pulse, making her an enemy of Cocoon. Lightning is soon joined by a band of allies, and together the group also become marked by the same Pulse creature. They rally against the Sanctum while trying to discover their assigned task and <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> avoid being turned into monsters or crystals at the completion.|$|E

2500|$|Diagnosis (confirming <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> have FAP)—this <b>can</b> be done {{either by}} genetic testing, which is definitive, or by {{visually}} checking the intestinal tract itself.|$|R
5|$|Diagnosis and {{treatment}} cost patients money, and the player can change hospital policy, including {{the amount of}} diagnosis patients require. This can be set to over 100 per cent to force patients to have further unnecessary diagnoses. Other policies include when staff can go on breaks and <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> leave rooms, and loans can be taken out. From time to time, events such as emergencies (in which patients arrive and must be cured within a time limit or they will die), and epidemics (in which a disease spreads rapidly) occur. During the latter, the player can attempt {{to cover it up}} by curing all affected patients before a health inspector turns up. If the player fails, he or she is fined and must face a damaged reputation, a statistic that shows how well the hospital is doing and affects the flow of patients. VIPs may also occasionally ask to tour the hospital; if impressed, the player is granted a cash bonus, a reputation increase, or both. There is an advisor who keeps the player informed about what is going on. Rats may infest the hospital, and the player is able to shoot them with the cursor.|$|E
25|$|There is {{debate about}} which {{boundaries}} are most relevant, and how or <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be usefully quantified.|$|E
25|$|Whether Balrogs have wings (and if so, <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> fly) is unclear. This is due {{partly to}} Tolkien's {{changing}} conception of Balrogs, but mostly to his imprecise but suggestive and possibly figurative {{description of the}} Balrog that confronted Gandalf in Moria.|$|E
50|$|Strongly {{connected}} {{components are}} also used to compute the Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition, a classification of the edges of a bipartite graph, according to <b>whether</b> or not <b>they</b> <b>can</b> {{be part of a}} perfect matching in the graph.|$|R
50|$|Applications {{need to be}} {{monitored}} and patched for technical vulnerabilities. Procedures for applying patches should include evaluating the patches to determine their appropriateness, and <b>whether</b> or not <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be successfully removed {{in case of a}} negative impact.|$|R
5000|$|Computer scoring {{systems can}} be [...] "gamed" [...] because they are poor at working with human language, further {{weakening}} the validity of their assessments and separating students {{not on the basis}} of writing ability but on <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> know and <b>can</b> use machine-tricking strategies.|$|R
25|$|While Israeli Arabs may {{volunteer}} {{to serve in}} the IDF, it is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> seek air force training. In 2006, an Israeli Arab applied for the pilot program, but was not accepted. In 2009 the first Israeli Druze finished the course and received his wings.|$|E
25|$|Opinions partly differ about {{sleep in}} migratory birds. The {{controversy}} is mainly about <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> sleep while flying or not. Theoretically, {{certain types of}} sleep could be possible while flying, but technical difficulties preclude the recording of brain activity in birds while they are flying.|$|E
25|$|In geometry, the Dehn {{invariant}} of a polyhedron is a value used {{to determine}} whether polyhedra can be dissected into each other or <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> tile space. It is named after Max Dehn, who used it to solve Hilbert's third problem on whether all polyhedra with equal volume could be dissected into each other.|$|E
40|$|The {{assumption}} that {{all forms of}} medical and psychological therapy should conform {{to the production of}} evidence advocated by NICE (The National Institute of Clinical Excellence) appears to evade the question <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> all <b>can.</b> In certain kinds of therapies within the mental health field, from psychoanalysis to the therapeutic community, there are significant issues about the applicability of these standard scientific methods. In this paper, I highlight some of the issues...|$|R
50|$|How Not to Be Wrong {{explains}} the mathematics behind some of simplest day-to-day thinking. It then goes into more complex decisions people make. For example, Ellenberg explains many misconceptions about lotteries and <b>whether</b> or not <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be mathematically beaten.|$|R
5000|$|The nearest tiger to {{the first}} oxen dropped on the board is the first tiger to move, but Low does not {{describe}} how tigers can move, that is, <b>whether</b> or not <b>they</b> <b>can</b> move orthogonally or diagonally, and whether their movements are limited to an adjacent vacant square, or if <b>they</b> <b>can</b> move any number of unoccupied squares.|$|R
25|$|Some {{strains of}} LAB may {{modulate}} inflammatory and hypersensitivity responses, an observation {{thought to be}} at least in part due to the regulation of cytokine function. Clinical studies are assessing <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> prevent recurrences of inflammatory bowel disease in adults, as well as affect milk allergies. How probiotics may influence the immune system remains unclear.|$|E
25|$|They {{locate a}} {{habitable}} world, which Ellie names Charity, and the passengers become colonists. Meanwhile, the crew continues {{to try to}} figure out where they are and <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> return to Earth. Unfortunately, it turns out the planet is already inhabited by hostile centaur-like sapients. Max and Ellie are captured, but Ellie's pet is able to guide Sam to them. They escape, though Sam is killed covering their retreat.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft also {{supported}} in-place upgrades from a lower edition of Windows 7 {{to a higher}} one, using the Windows Anytime Upgrade tool. There are currently three retail options available (though it is currently unclear <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be used with previous installations of the N versions). There are no family pack versions of the Anytime Upgrade editions. It was possible to use the Product Key from a Standard upgrade edition to accomplish an in-place upgrade (e.g. Home Premium to Ultimate).|$|E
40|$|AbstractOne way of verifying a grammar is the {{detection}} of ambiguities. Ambiguities are not always unwanted, but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> only be controlled if their sources are known. Unfortunately, the ambiguity problem for context-free grammars is undecidable in the general case. Various ambiguity detection methods (ADMs) exist, but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> never be perfect. In this paper we explore three ADMs to test <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> still <b>can</b> be of any practical value: the derivation generator AMBER, the LR(k) test and the Noncanonical Unambiguity test. We benchmarked their implementations on a collection of ambiguous and unambiguous grammars of different sizes and compared their practical usability. We measured the accuracy, termination and performance of the methods, and analyzed how their accuracy could be traded for performance...|$|R
50|$|At the {{smallest}} scale, DNA is packaged into units called nucleosomes. The quantity and organisation of these nucleosomes {{can affect the}} accessibility of local chromatin. This has a knock-on effect on the expression of nearby genes, additionally determining <b>whether</b> or not <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be regulated by transcription factors.|$|R
30|$|For most of {{the focus}} group participants, the future of privacy is {{something}} that emerges beyond their control. This tendency was clearest for those expressing the ‘dodo’ frame. This feeling of helplessness is problematic for privacy policy-making, particularly in Europe. One of the stated aims of the EU data protection reform is to empower citizens [61]. At the time of writing, {{it is too early}} to tell whether the process is successful, but Blume [62] argues that the General Data Protection Regulation does not empower citizens and this is actually not its goal. The theme of control actually includes two issues: whether citizens feel that they have control over their personal data, and <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> feel <b>they</b> <b>can</b> influence the debate on privacy protection. If there are widespread feelings of powerlessness, corrective measures such as increasing awareness are urgently needed.|$|R
25|$|In practice, {{stem cells}} are {{identified}} by <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> regenerate tissue. For example, the defining test for bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) {{is the ability to}} transplant the cells and save an individual without HSCs. This demonstrates that the cells can produce new blood cells over a long term. It should also be possible to isolate stem cells from the transplanted individual, which can themselves be transplanted into another individual without HSCs, demonstrating that the stem cell was able to self-renew.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the events}} of the season two finale, Vincent and Catherine can finally expose their {{relationship}} to the world. Vincent and Catherine will be living as a couple, but the challenge this season will be <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> keep outside forces from tearing them apart. Season three will have a stronger focus on family, with Heather Chandler being a more prominent character and the viewers being introduced to two of Catherine's aunts. The show's costume designer Catherine Ashton announced via Twitter that the third season will reportedly end with some closure and a big cliffhanger.|$|E
25|$|Singer {{argues that}} {{equality}} of consideration is a prescription, not an assertion of fact: if {{the equality of}} the sexes were based only {{on the idea that}} men and women were equally intelligent, we would have to abandon the practice of equal consideration if this were later found to be false. But the moral idea of equality does not depend on matters of fact such as intelligence, physical strength, or moral capacity. Equality therefore cannot be grounded on the outcome of scientific investigations into the intelligence of nonhumans. All that matters is <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> suffer.|$|E

25|$|We {{shall not}} say more {{concerning}} the corrective process afforded to the petitioners than {{that it does}} not seem to us sufficient to allow a Judge of the United States to escape the duty of examining the facts for himself when if true as alleged they make the trial absolutely void. We have confined the statement to facts admitted by the demurrer. We will not say that they cannot be met, but it appears to us unavoidable that the District Judge should find whether the facts alleged are true and <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> be explained so far as to leave the state proceedings undisturbed.|$|E
25|$|Noit Geva, {{daughter}} of a survivor, discovered that her grandmother, Zemira Mani (who was the grand{{daughter of}} Hebron's chief Sephardic rabbi, Eliyahu Mani), had written {{an account of the}} massacre, published in the Haaretz newspaper in 1929. In 1999 Geva released a film containing testimonies of 13 survivors {{that she and her husband}} Dan had managed to track down from the list in Sefer Hebron ("The Book of Hebron"). Originally intended to document the story of the Arab who had saved Geva's mother from other Arabs, it became also an account of the atrocities of the massacre itself. These survivors, most of whom no longer live in Israel, are mixed as to <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> forgive.|$|E
25|$|Viruses are obligate {{intracellular}} parasites, {{characterized by}} extremely limited biological function, {{to the point}} where, while they are evidently able to infect all other organisms from bacteria and archaea to animals, plants and fungi, it is unclear <b>whether</b> <b>they</b> <b>can</b> themselves be described as living. Viruses consist of a strip of genetic material (DNA or RNA), covered in a protein coat and sometimes a lipid envelope. They thus lack all the usual machinery of the cell such as enzymes, relying entirely on the host cell's ability to replicate DNA and synthesise proteins. Most viruses are bacteriophages, infecting bacteria, {{and it is possible}} that viruses are both extremely ancient, being at least as old as the first cells, and polyphyletic, having evolved from several entirely unrelated ancestors.|$|E
