50|$|As {{with other}} RUSs, the Scenarios <b>workstream</b> RUS invited {{responses}} from interested parties. The NR website acknowledged {{a number of}} responses, including the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR).|$|E
50|$|Unlike other RUSs and the {{electrification}} <b>workstream</b> this <b>workstream</b> {{does not}} consider any specific rail interventions. Instead {{the main focus of}} the document is to promote the concept of the use of 'Scenarios' to help determine possible variations in future demand for rail travel, in particular for trips over 50 miles. In contrast to other RUSs there is no consideration of short-term (CP4) or medium-term factors (CP5); the 'long-term' in passenger demand focussed on is overwhelmingly the year 2036, which is well beyond the time horizon of other RUSs (a single table suggests passenger growth rates to 2021); freight growth is considered to 2031.|$|E

To reflect this change in the company's business profile, it successfully applied in 2000 to the London Stock Exchange to relinquish its listing within the construction sector of the market, but to re-list within the support services sector on the FTSE market list. To reflect this change it renamed itself Interserve in 2001.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: This paper {{describes}} a three-year research project {{leading to the}} development of the CBR Monitoring Manual and Menu (MM&M). The MM&M is a practical toolkit that meets the needs of CBR managers and stakeholders, and is consistent with the philosophy of CBR and community-based disability-inclusive development. It is designed to produce meaningful and locally useful information and data, based on international data standards where possible, to enable aggregation at regional, national and international levels. Methods: Five complementary <b>workstreams</b> of research were carried out from 2011 to 2014 : 1) literature review and analysis; 2) participatory action research with CBR stakeholders; 3) analysis and refinement of validity of concepts and structures; 4) consultation and review; and 5) synthesis of results. This article documents the method and key results of each of the five <b>workstreams,</b> and the lessons learned along the way. Results: The MM&M is now freely available on-line at [URL] Collaboration among members of the development team continues, chiefly via an on-line group to which new members have been welcomed. Conclusion and Implications: At the time of writing, the MM&M is the only international monitoring product, known to the authors, that consciously sets out to reflect both a ‘bottom- up’ and ‘top-down’ perspective of monitoring information and data. To achieve this for a complex programme such as CBR, and to align with its principles, it was essential to use a multi-component and multi-stage strategy for tool development, involving a diverse multidisciplinary team includingcollaboration with CBR stakeholders...|$|R

5000|$|The {{aim of the}} Right Care Shared Decision-Making Programme is {{to embed}} shared {{decision-making}} in NHS care. This {{is part of the}} wider ambition to promote patient centred care, to increase patient choice, autonomy and involvement in clinical decision-making and make “no decision about me, without me” a reality. The Shared Decision-Making programme is part of the Quality Improvement Productivity and Prevention (QIPP) Right Care programme. In 2012, the programme entered an exciting new phase and, through three <b>workstreams,</b> is aiming to embed the practice of shared decision-making among patients and those who support them, and among health professionals and their educators.One of the components of the National Programme is the work of the Advancing Quality Alliance (AQuA) - [...] who are tasked with creating a receptive culture for shared decision-making with patients and health professionals.|$|R
40|$|A modern {{democracy}} is being created in Scotland following the re-establishment of the Scottish Parliament in 1999 with new executive and scrutiny structures. This paper reports on early developments {{and the emergence}} of the Scottish Executive’s organisational change programme – “changing to deliver” – {{as a response to the}} demands for public service reform and continuous service improvement. The paper outlines the contexts, theoretical framework, and earlyactions taken by the Executive to ground its work; examines the programme aims and the <b>workstreams</b> for change adopted as priorities for action; and reflects on more recent developments and the prospects for the success of the change programme. A key feature which characterises elected, government organisations is the relationship between elected people and senior unelected officials.

The objective of CompNet is to develop a more consistent analytical framework for assessing competitiveness, one which allows for a better correspondence between determinants and outcomes.

[...] By this agreement, Sir Ian or his deputy were to meet Ali and the MSF at least twice a year and to hold monthly meetings with the MSF at [...] "New Scotland Yard or other suitable premises". Met chiefs, including counter-terrorist commanders, were to attend the MSF's own meetings [...] "whenever possible”. The Met were to [...] "use the MSF as a consultation body to help formulate policy or practice" [...] and [...] "progress an annual plan of work through agreed priority workstreams," [...] jointly led by Met and MSF representatives.

40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} {{the cost and}} impact of a centrally-driven quality improvement initiative in four UK mental health communities. Methods: Total costs in year 1 were identified using documentation, a staff survey, semi-structured interviews and discussion groups. Few outcome data were collected within the programme so thematic {{analysis was used to}} identify the programme’s impact within its five broad underlying principles. Results: The survey had a 40 % response. Total costs ranged between £ 164, 000 and £ 458, 000 per site, plus staff time spent on <b>workstreams.</b> There was a very hazy view of the resources absorbed and poor recording of expenditure and activity. The initiative generated little demonstrable improvements in service quality but some participants reported changes in attitudes. Conclusions: Given the difficult contexts, short time-scales and capacity constraints, the programme’s lack of impact is not surprising. It may, however, represent a worthwhile investment in cultural change which might facilitate improvements in how services are delivered...|$|R
40|$|Background: Diseases such as {{stroke and}} heart disease are chiefly caused by {{unhealthy}} behaviours and are a major societal burden. User financial incentives are being explored {{as a way to}} encourage healthier lifestyles. This research developed a framework to provide information on pricing and cost-effectiveness of incentives and guide design of future incentive schemes. Methods: The <b>workstreams</b> were: a) structured, configurative literature review to identify neo-classical/behavioural economic explanations for behaviour change and incentives; b) contingent valuation survey to identify willingness to accept (WTA) and incentive pricing; c) systematic review and meta-analysis of incentives for weight loss; d) development of decision-analytic model to estimate cost-effectiveness of incentives for weight loss. Results: The reviews identified a number of factors important for understanding the effect of incentives including internal motivation, self-control and time preference. A theoretical framework of incentive impact was developed to facilitate WTA survey design. The WTA survey was completed by 112 people (n= 56 at 3 months). 57...|$|R
