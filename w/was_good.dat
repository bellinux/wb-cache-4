5|$|According to Sharaf, 1934–1937 was {{the happiest}} period of Reich's {{personal}} life, despite the professional problems. His relationship with Elsa Lindenberg <b>was</b> <b>good</b> and he considered marrying her. When {{she became pregnant}} in 1935, they were initially overjoyed, buying clothes and furniture for the child, but doubts developed for Reich, who saw the future as too unsettled. To Lindenberg's great distress, Sharaf writes, Reich insisted on an abortion, at that time illegal. They went to Berlin, where the psychoanalyst Edith Jacobson helped to arrange it.|$|E
5|$|After {{the rest}} day came the race's {{individual}} time trial. It was won by Dumoulin, {{who was more}} than a minute ahead of all the other riders in the race. His time <b>was</b> <b>good</b> enough to put him into the overall race lead. Aru rode strongly, and was only three seconds behind Dumoulin in the general classification after the stage. Rodríguez lost over three minutes to Dumoulin. Majka also lost significant time to Aru and Dumoulin and fell to fourth place.|$|E
5|$|BoxBoy! {{received}} a positive reception from critics. Reviewers praised the game's creative puzzles and inventive {{use of the}} box-manipulation mechanics. Some critics were pleasantly surprised {{by the amount of}} content that was offered and agreed that the package <b>was</b> <b>good</b> value for money. However, the game's simple art style was divisive among reviewers. A sequel, BoxBoxBoy!, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in 2016, with a third game, Bye-Bye BoxBoy!, in 2017.|$|E

5|$|Buffalo {{featured}} a high-powered, high-tempo, balanced offense that <b>was</b> <b>good</b> at not committing turnovers. During {{the regular season}} the Bulls averaged 380.5offensiveyards per game, 45thbest in the nation, and scored an average of 31.3points per game, 31stbest. Buffalo's turnover margin was 6thbest in the nation, at +1.15.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the show <b>was</b> <b>good</b> to average, with a general appreciation for the realistic portrayal of Middle America. Generally speaking, however, there were serious doubts about whether the show {{would be able to}} stay on the air very long, though it has since gone on to complete five seasons. The episode's viewership of just over seven million was characterized as disappointing, though it did relatively well among men aged 18 to 34.|$|E
5|$|Following Florida State's kickoff and a 38-yard return, Virginia Tech's offense {{began work}} at its 45-yard line. On the second {{play of the}} drive, Noel {{completed}} a 55-yard pass to Andre Davis, who ran {{into the end zone}} for Virginia Tech's second touchdown of the game. The extra point kick <b>was</b> <b>good,</b> and Virginia Tech regained the lead, 1713, with 40seconds remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|In {{regards to}} the English dub, Shinkai {{did not feel that}} he could judge the quality of the voice acting since he could not speak English natively. He felt that it <b>was</b> <b>good</b> due to the {{feedback}} he had received and because he could feel the emotion in the characters' voices. However, he noted that the experience would be different for viewers and that the final judgment could only be made by English-speaking audiences.|$|E
5|$|In the off-season, Eugene Melnyk would {{purchase}} {{the club to}} bring financial stability and the team entered the 2003–04 season with high expectations. Head Coach Jacques Martin would guide the team to another good regular season, finishing with 102 points. This <b>was</b> <b>good</b> for only third in the tightly contested Northeast Division, as Boston would have 104 and Toronto 103.|$|E

On Islam, he stated how it <b>was</b> <b>good</b> for abolishing the disgrace in human relationship, based on one of his speeches to railway employees at Tiruchirapalli in 1947. Periyar also commended Islam for its belief in one invisible and formless God; proclamation of equal rights for men and women; and advocating of social unity.|$|E

5|$|The Flames {{followed}} up their {{run to the}} Finals with their best regular season to that point. Calgary's 46–31–3 record in 1986–87 <b>was</b> <b>good</b> for third overall in the NHL, behind the Oilers and Philadelphia Flyers. However, the Flames were unable to duplicate their playoff success of a year prior, losing their first-round match-up with the Jets in six games. The season was also difficult off the ice, as 1986 first-round draft pick George Pelawa {{was killed in a}} car accident prior to the season's start.|$|E

5|$|The ensuing kickoff was {{returned}} by UConn running back Jordan Todman 45yards to the Buffalo 45-yard line.
