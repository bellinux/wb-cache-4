5|$|Around noon, as {{a result}} of poor {{coordination}} and signaling, the Swedish line unexpectedly turned toward the allied fleet. When the flagship Kronan came about in the maneuver it suddenly heeled over and began to take in water. According to master gunner Anders Gyllenspak, the sails were not reefed and the ship leaned over so hard that water flooded in through the lower gunports. As the ship <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> over, a gust of wind pushed the ship on her side, bringing her masts and sails down in line with the surface of the sea. Shortly afterwards, the gunpowder store exploded and ripped the forward section of the starboard side apart. Kronan quickly lost buoyancy and sank, taking most of her 850-man crew with her.|$|E
5|$|He {{scored two}} more {{victories}} on 23 and 28 April, his {{first in the}} North African Campaign. However, on 23 April, Marseille himself was shot down during his third sortie of that day by Sous-Lieutenant James Denis a Free French pilot with No. 73 Squadron RAF (8.5 victories), flying a Hawker Hurricane. Marseille's Bf 109 received almost 30 hits in the cockpit area, and three or four shattered the canopy. As Marseille <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> forward the rounds missed him by inches. Marseille managed to crash-land his fighter. Just a month later, records show that James Denis shot down Marseille again on 21 May 1941. Marseille engaged Denis, but overshot his target. A turning dogfight ensued, in which Denis once again bested Marseille.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, two-time former {{governor}} and Democratic factional leader Happy Chandler {{had already begun}} his campaign for a third term as governor. The anti-Chandler faction became concerned that, {{if they did not}} name a candidate, Chandler's early announcement would give him an advantage in the 1963 election. Leaders of the faction were solidly behind state Highway Commissioner Henry Ward, but Governor Combs <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> toward Breathitt. Breathitt announced his candidacy on May 2, 1962, but many in his party remained skeptical due to his youth and relative inexperience. Combs eventually convinced the anti-Chandler faction to back Breathitt, and Ward never became a candidate.|$|E

5|$|In 1957, Malaya {{received}} {{its independence from}} Britain {{as part of their}} decolonisation process in that region. The British government, in their reorganisation of the region following their departure, sought to combine Malaya with Singapore and the states of Sarawak, North Borneo, and Brunei to form a new 'Malaysian Federation.' This would serve British interests in these regions, particularly military basing rights, which they hoped the Malaysians would protect. Indonesia, however, and in particular President Sukarno, was fiercely opposed to such a project. Sukarno, who <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> ever closer towards the Communist bloc of China and Russia, despised the 'imperialist' British, and had planned to incorporate the latter three regions, all of which are located on the northern tip of Borneo, with the Indonesian-controlled territory of Kalimantan, which makes up the vast majority of that island. Sukarno determined to begin a military Confrontation with Malaysia, which through a series of raids and supported revolts might improve Indonesia's position in negotiating for the island.|$|E

25|$|Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson both took {{moderate}} positions {{designed to}} bring the South back into the union as quickly as possible, while Radical Republicans in Congress sought stronger measures to upgrade the rights of African Americans, including the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, while curtailing the rights of former Confederates, such as through {{the provisions of the}} Wade–Davis Bill. Johnson followed a lenient policy toward ex-Confederates. Lincoln's last speeches show that he <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> toward supporting the enfranchisement of all freedmen, whereas Johnson was opposed to this.|$|E
25|$|In December 2012, the Canadian {{government}} decided that F-35 costs were {{much higher than}} earlier anticipated and hence {{are looking at the}} Eurofighter as well as four other fighters to replace their ageing CF-18s. In January 2014 it seemed unlikely that a decision on a replacement would be taken before the next federal election in October 2015. This election occurred, and while Canada <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> more towards US fighters like the F/A-18 E/F Super Hornet or back to the F-35, as of June 2017 protectionist rhetoric by the US government (and a trade complaint by Boeing against Bombardier) has caused the Canadian government to stop discussions about acquiring the Super Hornet and look at other, potentially non-US options.|$|E
25|$|Following independence, Ukraine {{declared}} {{itself a}} neutral state. The country {{has had a}} limited military partnership with Russian Federation, other CIS countries and a partnership with NATO since 1994. In the 2000s, the government <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> towards NATO, and a deeper cooperation with the alliance was set by the NATO-Ukraine Action Plan signed in 2002. It was later agreed {{that the question of}} joining NATO should be answered by a national referendum {{at some point in the}} future. Recently deposed President Viktor Yanukovych considered the current level of co-operation between Ukraine and NATO sufficient, and was against Ukraine joining NATO. During the 2008 Bucharest summit, NATO declared that Ukraine would eventually become a member of NATO when it meets the criteria for the accession.|$|E

There was political turmoil and sporadic combat within Laos as both Kong Le and Phoumi solicited support from Lao senior officers.

The staff at Military Region 1 in Luang Prabang plumped for him, as did Lieutenant Colonel Khamouane Boupha and his troops in farflung Phongsaly Province. Internationally, he drew tepid support, mostly by communist-bloc nations. The French military mission delivered vague promises and fresh French uniforms. Lao commanding officers such as Generals Amkha Soukhavong, Kouprasith Abhay, Ouane Rattikone, Oudone Sananikone, and Sing Rattanasamy backed him with various levels of enthusiasm.|$|E
25|$|As Helmsman Cho sharply {{turned the}} wheel from 135 to 150 degrees, Sewol began to list to port and tilt towards the water. The overall effect {{was that the}} ship turned about 45 degrees to the right, then rotated 22 degrees on the spot for a span of 20 seconds. The cargo falling {{to one side of}} the ship caused Sewol to lose all her {{restoring}} force and allowed water to flow into the ship through the side door of the cargo loading bay and the car entrance located at the stern. This scenario was confirmed by simulations separately run by the expert advisory panel on the joint investigation team, the Korea Research Institute of Ships and Ocean Engineering, and the Advanced Marine Engineering Center of Seoul National University. The chief engineer testified that the tilting lasted for about two to three minutes after the initial tilt. During this time, Oh Yong-seok, an off-duty helmsman who was sleeping in his cabin, was awakened when he was thrown against its port side. As of 8:50a.m., Sewol <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> 30 degrees to port.|$|E
25|$|With {{the demise}} of Khan Sevar (r.738–753) the ruling Dulo clan died out and the Khanate fell into a long {{political}} crisis during which the young country {{was on the verge}} of destruction. In just fifteen years seven Khans reigned, and all of them were murdered. The only surviving sources of this period are Byzantine and present only the Byzantine point of view of the ensuing political turmoil in Bulgaria. They describe two factions struggling for powerone that sought peaceful relations with the Empire, which was dominant until 755, and one that favoured war. These sources present the relations with the Byzantine Empire as the main issue in this internal struggle and do not mention the other reasons, which could have been more important for the Bulgarian elite. It is likely that the relationship between the politically dominant Bulgars and the more numerous Slavs was the main issue behind the struggle but there is no evidence about the aims of the rival factions. Zlatarski speculates that the old Bulgar military aristocracy <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> towards war while other Bulgars supported by the majority of the Slavs were inclined for peace with Byzantium.|$|E

25|$|The Medical Treatment and Care Building {{included}} a basement level that was exposed (above grade) {{on the east}} and south sides, mixed (above and below grade) on the west side, and below grade {{on the north side}} of the building, due to the shallow slope at the site. The complete structure, including the four external stairways, could be considered five separate buildings, since the stair towers were detached from the main building by about four inches. Earthquake bracing used in the building's second through fifth floors consisted of shear walls, but a rarely used slip joint technique used with the concrete walls at the first floor level excluded them from being used with that system. Damage to the building (including ceiling tiles, telephone equipment, and elevator doors) was described as excessive at the basement and first floor levels, with little damage further up. The difference in rigidity at the second floor was proposed as a cause of the considerable damage to the lower levels. As a result of the first floor nearly collapsing, the building <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> to the north by nearly two feet, and three of the four concrete stair towers fell away from the main building.|$|E
25|$|Arrúe {{maintained}} {{very good}} relations with the Carlist political leader; he shared Fal’s intransigence on dynastical and anti-Francoist issues, while Fal shared and supported Arrúe’s drive to promote the Basque identity. Though in 1953 the Gipuzkoan junta was reconstituted under Ignacio Ruz de Prada and with Pablo Iturria as its secretary, it was in fact Arrúe remaining the provincial leader. One scholar suggests that Arrúe conspired against Fal, considering him too conventional in his anti-Francoist bid; {{if this is the case}} indeed, the ensuing deposition of Fal and collaborationist turn of mid-1950s caught Arrúe bitterly disappointed; he <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> to a Sivattista dissidence. With José María Valiente emerging as a new national jefe, in 1956 Arrúe tried to oppose his course by forming Junta del Regiones; this semi-rebellious body was bent on preventing rapprochement with Francoism and envisioned a loose alliance of Carlists, nationalists, regionalists, Catholics and even some sectors of the Falange. The junta proved to be short-lived and some of its participants soon backtracked when challenged by Valiente, but Arrúe did not. In 1957 as Gipuzkoan jefe he automatically entered the newly formed Junta de Gobierno de la Comunión and kept confronting the new leader, accusing him of betraying the Carlist spirit. In early 1959 he resigned as jefe of Gipuzkoan Carlism, quoting disagreement with policy of the new Secretariat.|$|E
25|$|Acharya later {{returned}} to Berlin {{and over the}} course of the war, was in Stockholm briefly along with Virendranath Chattopadhyaya. In Stockholm in May 1917, Acharya and Chattopadhyaya formed a Propaganda Bureau and later joined by Har Dayal. This bureau worked independently of the Berlin Committee and the German foreign office. The duo are known to have met with K.M. Troionovsky at this time and explained the Indian situation, winning approval from the latter for the Indian cause. The Paris Indian society had been in touch with Russian communists before the Russian revolution. Nicholas Safransky, a Russian bomb expert, is known to have been involved in training the Indian revolutionaries in bomb manufacture and explosives. and Acharya was greatly impressed by the revolution itself, hailed at the time as a watershed in the struggle of colonial people against imperialism. The publication of a manifesto by the Soviet Union declaring support for colonies against imperialism was attractive to the Indian nationalists, who saw Soviet Russia as a future centre for coordinating activities, and also intended Russia to be a channel for Indian nationalists in any peace negotiations. This was also the time that the Swedish government under diplomatic pressure from Britain, gradually <b>was</b> <b>leaning</b> on the Indian propaganda bureau, while relationship of the Berlin committee with the German foreign office was also strained on apprehensions of German imperial designs and over allocation of funds. Chatto and Acharya arranged for Troionovsky to be provided with a large amount of the committee's literature to acquaint the Soviets with the Indian situation when the latter left Stockholm for Petrograd. However, Acharya was ultimately disappointed with the Socialist conference in Stockholm, which in his opinion entirely skirted the issue of the colonies. Towards the end of 1918, Acharya {{returned to}} Berlin along with Chatto.|$|E
