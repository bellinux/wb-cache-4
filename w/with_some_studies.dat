5|$|The {{specificity}} of RSTs {{for the presence}} of GAS is at least 95%, <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> finding close to 100% specificity. Therefore, if the test result is positive, the presence of GAS is highly likely. However, 5% to 20% of individuals carry GAS in their throats without symptomatic infection, so the presence of GAS in an individual with pharyngitis does not prove that this organism is responsible for the infection. The sensitivity of lateral flow RSTs is somewhat lower at 65% to 80%. Therefore, a negative result from such a test cannot be used to rule out GAS pharyngitis, a considerable disadvantage compared with microbial culture, which has a sensitivity of 90% to 95%. However, newer optical immunoassay RSTs have been found to have a much higher sensitivity of 94%.|$|E

25|$|Caesarean section can be {{performed}} with single or double layer suturing of the uterine incision. Single layer closure compared with double layer closure has been observed to result in reduced blood loss during the surgery. It is uncertain whether this is the direct effect of the suturing technique or if other {{factors such as the}} type and site of abdominal incision contribute to reduced blood loss. Standard procedure includes the closure of the peritoneum. However, research questions this may not be needed, <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> indicating peritoneal closure is associated with longer operative time and hospital stay. The Misgave Ladach method is a surgery technical that may have fewer secondary complications and faster healing, due to the insertion into the muscle.|$|E

25|$|The {{prognosis}} for psychopathy in forensic and clinical settings is quite poor, <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> reporting that treatment may worsen the antisocial aspects of psychopathy {{as measured by}} recidivism rates, though {{it is noted that}} one of the frequently cited studies finding increased criminal recidivism after treatment, a 2011 retrospective study of a treatment program in the 1960s, had several serious methodological problems and likely would not be approved of today. However, some relatively rigorous quasi-experimental studies using more modern treatment methods have found improvements regarding reducing future violent and other criminal behavior, regardless of PCL-R scores, although none were randomized controlled trials. Various other studies have found improvements in risk factors for crime such as substance abuse. No study has of yet in a 2013 review examined if the personality traits that form the core character disturbances of psychopathy could be changed by such treatments.|$|E
25|$|Problems in {{developing}} social skills, or 'social fluency', {{may be a}} cause of some social anxiety disorder, through either inability or lack of confidence to interact socially and gain positive reactions and acceptance from others. The studies have been mixed, however, <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> not finding significant problems in social skills while others have. What does seem clear is that the socially anxious perceive their own social skills to be low. It {{may be that the}} increasing need for sophisticated social skills in forming relationships or careers, and an emphasis on assertiveness and competitiveness, is making social anxiety problems more common, at least among the 'middle classes'. An interpersonal or media emphasis on 'normal' or 'attractive' personal characteristics has also been argued to fuel perfectionism and feelings of inferiority or insecurity regarding negative evaluation from others. The need for social acceptance or social standing has been elaborated in other lines of research relating to social anxiety.|$|E
25|$|Stolons {{arise from}} the base of the plant. In {{strawberries}} the base is above the soil surface; in many bulb-forming species and plants with rhizomes, the stolons remain underground and form shoots that rise to the surface at the ends or from the nodes. The nodes of the stolons produce roots, often all around the node and hormones produced by the roots cause the stolon to initiate shoots with normal leaves. Typically after the formation of the new plant the stolon dies away in a year or two, while rhizomes persist normally for many years or for the life of the plant, adding more length each year to the ends with active growth. The horizontal growth of stolons results from the interplay of different hormones produced at the growing point and hormones from the main plant, <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> showing that stolon and rhizome growth are affected by the amount of shady light the plant receives with increased production and branching from plants exposed to mixed shade and sun, while plants in all day sun or all shade produce fewer stolons.|$|E

25|$|Ketamine {{has been}} found to act as a potent partial agonist of the high-affinity state of the human and rat {{dopamine}} D2 receptors in multiple studies. Its apparent potency for this action {{is similar to that of}} its NMDA receptor antagonism. However, there are also contradictory data, with studies finding an affinity of ketamine of >10,000nbsp&nM for the regular human and rat D2 receptors, and direct interactions with the D2 receptor are controversial. Moreover, whereas D2 receptor agonists like bromocriptine are able to rapidly and powerfully suppress prolactin secretion, subanesthetic doses of ketamine have not been found to do this in humans and in fact have been found to significantly and dose-dependently increase prolactin levels. Imaging studies have shown mixed results on inhibition of striatal raclopride binding by ketamine in humans, <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> finding a significant decrease and others finding no such effect. However, changes in raclopride binding may be due to changes in dopamine concentrations induced by ketamine rather than binding of ketamine to the D2 receptor.|$|E
25|$|Anti-double {{stranded}} DNA (anti-dsDNA) antibodies {{are highly}} associated with SLE. They {{are a very}} specific marker for the disease, <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> quoting nearly 100%. Data on sensitivity ranges from 25–85%. Anti-dsDNA antibody levels, known as titres, correlate with disease activity in SLE; high levels indicate more active lupus. The presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies is also linked with lupus nephritis and there is evidence they are the cause. Some anti-dsDNA antibodies are cross reactive with other antigens found on {{the glomerular basement membrane}} (GBM) of the kidney, such as heparan sulphate, collagen IV, fibronectin and laminin. Binding to these antigens within the kidney could cause inflammation and complement fixation, resulting in kidney damage. Presence of high DNA-binding and low C3 levels have been shown to have extremely high predictive value (94%) for the diagnosis of SLE. It is also possible that the anti-dsDNA antibodies are internalised by cells when they bind membrane antigens and then are displayed on the cell surface. This could promote inflammatory responses by T-cells within the kidney. It {{is important to note that}} not all anti-dsDNA antibodies are associated with lupus nephritis and that other factors can cause this symptom in their absence. The antigen of anti-dsDNA antibodies is double stranded DNA.|$|E
25|$|Gutworms {{and similar}} parasites {{are present in}} {{untreated}} drinking water in developing countries, and {{were present in the}} water of developed countries until the routine chlorination and purification of drinking water supplies. Recent research has shown that some common parasites, such as intestinal worms (e.g., hookworms), secrete chemicals into the gut wall (and, hence, the bloodstream) that suppress the immune system and prevent the body from attacking the parasite. This gives rise to a new slant on the hygiene hypothesis theory—that co-evolution of humans and parasites has led to an immune system that functions correctly only {{in the presence of the}} parasites. Without them, the immune system becomes unbalanced and oversensitive. In particular, research suggests that allergies may coincide with the delayed establishment of gut flora in infants. However, the research to support this theory is conflicting, <b>with</b> <b>some</b> <b>studies</b> performed in China and Ethiopia showing an increase in allergy in people infected with intestinal worms. Clinical trials have been initiated to test the effectiveness of certain worms in treating some allergies. It may be that the term 'parasite' could turn out to be inappropriate, and in fact a hitherto unsuspected symbiosis is at work. For more information on this topic, see Helminthic therapy.|$|E
