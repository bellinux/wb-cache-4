5|$|Because the Laborers {{had more}} {{applicants}} than jobs available, {{the process for}} getting a job on the pipeline through Laborers Local 942 was a multi-tiered process. There were multiple levels of eligibility, based {{on the amount of}} seniority a person had. A-level members had the first pick of jobs, but they had to have worked at least 800 hours <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>union</b> in the previous year. B-level members had to have worked between 100 and 800 hours <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>union.</b> C-level members had to have at least two years of experience outside of Alaska or be an Alaska resident for at least one year. D-level was for everyone else, and D-level people rarely got jobs. That didn't stop people from trying. At 11 a.m. on January 1, 1974, shortly before the pipeline right-of-way was signed, more than 100 people spent the night outside the Fairbanks office of the Laborers Union, waiting for the first choice of jobs when the office opened.|$|E

Mr. Burns then decides to take on the union, and revokes their dental plan.|$|E

50|$|Reduction in {{the power}} of <b>the</b> trades <b>unions</b> was made gradually, unlike the {{approach}} of the Heath Government, and the greatest single confrontation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>unions</b> was <b>the</b> National <b>Union</b> of Mineworkers (NUM) strike of 1984-85, in which <b>the</b> miners' <b>union</b> was eventually defeated. There is evidence that this confrontation <b>with</b> <b>the</b> trade <b>unions</b> was anticipated by both the Conservative party and the NUM. The outcome contributed to the resurgence of the power of capital over labour.|$|R

But many Native Hawaiians and Hawaiian-born Americans (mainly descendants of the American missionaries) both abroad and in the islands volunteered and enlisted in the military regiments of various states in the Union and the Confederacy. Individual Native Hawaiians had been serving in the United States Navy and Army since the War of 1812, and even more served during the American Civil War. Many Hawaiians sympathized <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> because of Hawaiʻi's ties to New England through its missionaries and the whaling industries, and the ideological opposition of many to the institution of slavery.|$|E
5|$|Ballpark is {{near the}} point where the Salt Lake and Utah {{interurban}} streetcar line crossed the first mainline built south from Salt Lake City (which has been known by many names, but is most associated <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> Pacific Railroad).

This local militia allied itself <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>Union</b> army forces at Jefferson Barracks under the leadership of Nathaniel Lyon, which on May 10, 1861 cleared a Confederate encampment outside the city in {{what became known as the}} Camp Jackson Affair. While the Confederates were being marched back into town, a group of citizens attacked the Union and militia forces, costing 28 civilian lives.|$|E

5|$|Greenland {{is one of}} {{the three}} {{constituent}} countries of the Kingdom of Denmark, with Queen Margrethe II as the reigning sovereign. The territory first came under monarchical rule in 1261, when the populace accepted the overlordship of the King of Norway; by 1360, Norway had entered into a personal union with the Kingdom of Denmark, which became more entrenched <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>union</b> of the kingdoms into Denmark–Norway in 1536. After the dissolution of this arrangement in 1814, Greenland remained as a Danish colony, and, after its role in World War II, was granted its special status within the Kingdom of Denmark in 1953. The monarch is represented in the territory by the Rigsombudsmand (High Commissioner), Mikaela Engell.|$|E
