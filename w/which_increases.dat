5|$|Recombination allows {{chromosomes}} {{to exchange}} genetic information and produces new combinations of genes, <b>which</b> <b>increases</b> {{the efficiency of}} natural selection and can be important in the rapid evolution of new proteins. Genetic recombination can also be involved in DNA repair, particularly in the cell's response to double-strand breaks.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with items}} and money earned from battles, winning battles earns {{experience}} points <b>which</b> <b>increases</b> each party member's level and {{allows them to}} learn skills from their weapons. Performing well in battles, such as achieving quick victories or successful Session Attacks, increases party members' Stage Level, which unlock Performa for Radiant Skills and opens up new side stories. The game ends, sending the player back to the title screen, if all party members are knocked unconscious by running out of HP.|$|E

50|$|Knowing is {{influenced}} by the fluency in which an item is processed, regardless of whether information is conceptual or perceptual. Know responses are enhanced by manipulations <b>which</b> <b>increase</b> perceptual and conceptual fluency. For example, masked repetition priming, modality match during study and test, and the use of easy word-fragments in word-fragment recall are all perceptual manipulations <b>which</b> <b>increase</b> know responses. An example of a conceptual manipulation which enhances know responses is when a prime item is semantically related to a target item. Manipulations <b>which</b> <b>increase</b> processing fluency do not seem to affect remember responses.|$|R

5|$|An active {{vibration}} control system, {{known as the}} active control of structural response system, reduces airframe vibration by up to 80% <b>which</b> <b>increases</b> crew comfort and minimises the buildup of stress on the airframe. The cockpit is fitted with armoured seats for the crew, and can withstand an impact velocity of over 10m/s. Dual flight controls are provided, though the AW101 can be flown by a single person. The pilots' instrument displays include six full-colour high-definition screens and an optional mission display; a digital map or forward looking infrared (FLIR) display can also be installed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{element is}} a {{powerful}} attack substitution that occasionally appears when a character's health is low. Similar features appear in later Final Fantasy titles {{under a variety of}} different names, including Limit Breaks, Desperation Moves, Trances, and Overdrives. Characters are rewarded for victorious battles with experience points and money, called gil (Gold Piece (GP) in the original North American localization). When characters attain a certain amount of experience points, they gain a level, <b>which</b> <b>increases</b> their statistics. An additional player may play during battle scenarios, with control of individual characters assigned from the configuration menu.|$|E
5|$|Believing {{that the}} {{original}} game was too easy, Davis initiated development of Faster Harder More Challenging Q*bert (also known as FHMC Q*bert) in 1983, <b>which</b> <b>increases</b> the difficulty, introduces Q*bertha and adds a bonus round. Finally, the project was canceled and the game never entered production. Davis later released FHMC Q*berts ROM image onto the web.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines share {{a similar}} {{chemical}} structure, {{and their effects}} in humans are mainly produced by the allosteric modification of a specific kind of neurotransmitter receptor, the GABAA receptor, <b>which</b> <b>increases</b> the overall conductance of these inhibitory channels; this results in the various therapeutic effects as well as adverse effects of benzodiazepines. Other less important mechanisms of action are also known.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus stercoreus {{has been}} {{investigated}} {{for its ability to}} break down lignin and cellulose in agricultural byproducts, like wheat straw or grasses. It selectively breaks down lignin, leaving much of the cellulose intact, <b>which</b> <b>increases</b> the amount of digestible carbohydrate for ruminant mammals, and enhances both its value as a food source and its biodegradability. The enzymes responsible, laccase and manganese peroxidase, also have industrial applications for lignin degradation and removal in the pulp and paper industry. Liquid cultures of C.stercoreus have also been shown to biodegrade the explosive compound 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT).|$|E
5|$|Indium(III) oxide and indium {{tin oxide}} (ITO) are used as a {{transparent}} conductive coating on glass substrates in electroluminescent panels. Indium tin oxide {{is used as a}} light filter in low-pressure sodium-vapor lamps. The infrared radiation is reflected back into the lamp, <b>which</b> <b>increases</b> the temperature within the tube and improves the performance of the lamp.|$|E

5|$|Initially, Sanders and KFC used {{hydrogenated}} {{vegetable oil}} for frying, {{but in the}} 1980s the company began to switch to cheaper oils such as palm or soybean. In the 2000s {{it became apparent that}} these oils contain relatively high levels of trans fat, <b>which</b> <b>increases</b> the risk of heart disease. By April 2007, the chain had switched to trans fat-free soybean oil in all of its US outlets.|$|E
5|$|Low-power and {{high-power}} devices remain operational {{with this}} standard, but devices using SuperSpeed {{can take advantage}} of increased available current of between 150mA and 900mA, respectively. Additionally, there is a Battery Charging Specification (Version 1.2â€“ December 2010), <b>which</b> <b>increases</b> the power handling capability to 1.5A but does not allow concurrent data transmission. The Battery Charging Specification requires that the physical ports themselves be capable of handling 5A of current but limits the maximum current drawn to 1.5A.|$|E
5|$|The fan {{diameter}} {{varies with}} the different models of the CFM56, and that change has {{a direct impact on}} the engine performance. For example, the low-pressure shaft rotates at the same speed for both the CFM56-2 and the CFM56-3 models; the fan diameter is smaller on the -3, which lowers the tip speed of the fan blades. The lower speed allows the fan blades to operate more efficiently (5.5% more in this case), <b>which</b> <b>increases</b> the overall fuel efficiency of the engine (improving specific fuel consumption nearly 3%).|$|E

5|$|Transport between islands is {{primarily}} by ferry, and Shetland Islands Council operates various inter-island services. Shetland is also {{served by a}} domestic connection from Lerwick to Aberdeen on mainland Scotland. This service, which takes about 12 hours, is operated by NorthLink Ferries. Some services also call at Kirkwall, Orkney, <b>which</b> <b>increases</b> the journey time between Aberdeen and Lerwick by 2 hours. There are plans for road tunnels {{to some of the}} islands, especially Bressay and Whalsay, however it is hard to convince the mainland government to finance them.|$|E
5|$|Viruses are an {{important}} natural means of transferring genes between different species, <b>which</b> <b>increases</b> genetic diversity and drives evolution. It is thought that viruses {{played a central role}} in the early evolution, before the diversification of bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes, at the time of the last universal common ancestor of life on Earth. Viruses are still one of the largest reservoirs of unexplored genetic diversity on Earth.|$|E
5|$|When {{there is}} more pollen applied to the stigma, more seeds are {{produced}} in the fruits and the fruits are larger with greater likelihood of maturation, an effect called xenia. Competitively grown specimens are therefore often hand-pollinated to maximize the number of seeds in the fruit, <b>which</b> <b>increases</b> the fruit size; this pollination requires skilled technique. Seedlessness is known to occur in certain cultivars of C.pepo.|$|E

5|$|Aside from {{sporting}} uses, the Emirates {{has been}} used as a music venue <b>which</b> <b>increases</b> the maximum capacity to 72,000. Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band became the first band to play a concert at the stadium on 30 May 2008. They played a second gig the following night. British band Coldplay played three concerts at the Emirates in the June 2012, having sold out the first two dates within 30 minutes of going on sale. They were the first band to sell out the stadium for music purposes. Green Day set an gig attendance record when performing at the Emirates in June 2013.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} is rare, with {{an estimated}} 3-4 cases per million annual incidence in adults. While it may occur in all age groups, it is most common in the third decade. 75% are female. Given that older studies show no difference in incidence between men and women, {{it has been suggested}} that the use of oral contraceptives in women is behind the disparity between the sexes. A 1995 report from Saudi Arabia found a doubled incidence at 7 cases per 100,000; this was attributed to the fact that BehÃ§et's disease, <b>which</b> <b>increases</b> risk of CVST, is more common in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|Cerebrospinal fluid envelops {{the brain}} and the spine, and lumbar {{puncture}} or spinal tap is the removal of {{a small amount of}} fluid using a needle inserted between the lumbar vertebrae. Characteristic findings in Guillainâ€“BarrÃ© syndrome are an elevated protein level, usually greater than 0.55g/L, and fewer than 10 white blood cells per cubic millimeter of fluid ("albuminocytological dissociation"). This combination distinguishes Guillainâ€“BarrÃ© syndrome from other conditions (such as lymphoma and poliomyelitis) in which both the protein and the cell count are elevated. Elevated CSF protein levels are found in approximately 50% of patients in the first 3 days after onset of weakness, <b>which</b> <b>increases</b> to 80% after the first week.|$|E
