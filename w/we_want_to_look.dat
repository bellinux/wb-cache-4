In each country, representative samples of the general public were interviewed using the same structured questionnaire in all countries. Euthanasia was explained in the questionnaires as ‘terminating the life of the incurably sick’. Results: A total of 46 199 respondents participated in the surveys.

50|$|Response bias {{is another}} {{cross-cultural}} difference {{that has been}} shown to affect how we measure constructs and interpret the results. Social desirability bias is a tendency to give a socially acceptable answer, even if it is a lie, because <b>we</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> good. Giving socially acceptable, but part or completely false, answers can inflate interview scores. One simple example of socially acceptable answers is called acquiescence bias, which is a tendency to agree with all questions with positive meaning. People also have been found to show different attitudes towards answers on the extreme high and low end of a set of options (extremely agree or extremely disagree). In some cases, people from a different cultures may just be unfamiliar with a word (term, concept, context) or with a type of question. Another research study found that self and other reports of conscientiousness failed to relate with expected job behaviors across cultures, demonstrating {{that one of the most}} predictive constructs in the USA is tied to aspects of USA culture that may not be present in a different type of culture.|$|E

30|$|It is {{important}} to note that our principal measure of the semantic task was the IES (Bruyer & Brysbaert, 2011). We chose this measure because <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> assess reader efficiency, not just their reading speed or accuracy; thus, <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>look</b> for efficient (fast and accurate) readers. The choice of this variable was thus consistent with the purpose of this study. If we had used only the percentage of correct responses, we would not have been able to generate a model in the regression. Other studies (see Ouellette, 2006; Swart et al., 2017) used the mean score of various semantic tasks to create a “semantic variable.” The prediction of the IES in our study was similar to the mean scores in other studies. Thus, we strongly encourage the use of the IES for other studies with similar tasks and objectives.|$|R

The study was performed as a cross-sectional study where the participants answered a questionnaire. During the 2006 / 2007 and 2007 / 2008 volleyball seasons we gathered 195 valid cases. These were analyzed in SPSS/PSPP. The result was a prevalence of shoulder overuse injuries of 36, 4 % with mean duration of three years and absence from training/match of almost three months. 42, 6 % of the players had experienced shoulder symptoms at an earlier point in their volleyball career. Only 39, 0 % of the players have never had any shoulder pain. There were no differences between the sexes in {{the prevalence of}} shoulder overuse injuries, but significant {{more men than women}} had once experienced shoulder problems. No significant difference was detected between the leagues. Higher age and longer playing experience correlated with higher prevalence of shoulder pain. If the players had a job where their shoulders were exposed to stress they had 1, 8 times higher risk of getting shoulder overuse injuries. The players with shoulder pain did also have more other overuse injuries. We conclude that shoulder overuse injuries are a common problem among Norwegian volleyball players as only 39, 0 % of the players have never experienced any trouble with their shoulders and the injuries last for long...|$|R

Method: This study is largely based on literary sources, in addition to a personal excursion to Malawi in order to gain first-hand knowledge and a better understanding of the challenges facing the country. Discussion and conclusion: We found that the current international guidelines are effective tools in the fight against malaria, and that DDT use is still indicated because of a lack of better alternatives. Through developing these recommendations and helping in their fulfilment, international organizations such as WHO play an important role in the continued fight against malaria. Countries can use the international recommendations to develop their own national guidelines, adapting them to better suit local resources and priorities. On-going research has a lot of potential to help make the guidelines become even more effective in the future.
