Nanna, Baldr's wife, also threw {{herself on the}} funeral fire to await Ragnarök <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be reunited with her husband (alternatively, she died of grief). Baldr's horse with all its trappings was also burned on the pyre. The ship was set to sea by Hyrrokin, a giantess, who came riding on a wolf and gave the ship such a push that fire flashed from the rollers and all the earth shook.|$|E

On the June 20, 2013 episode of the Prospect Park version of All My Children, Opal Cortlandt tells Dimitri Marick, one of Erica's ex-husbands that Erica {{was out of town}} last seen getting on an airplane to some exotic location without saying <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be back.|$|E
25|$|On 1 August 2010, the News of the World {{reported}} that Palmer {{was pregnant with}} her fourth child {{and that she would}} take maternity leave from EastEnders later in the year. It also noted that she was already showing a baby bump. To facilitate the departure, Bianca will feature in a major storyline, which executive producer Bryan Kirkwood said was the only possible reason Bianca would have for leaving her family. In December 2010, it was announced that Natalie Cassidy would return as part of Bianca's departure storyline which started in January 2011. Bianca's departure was broadcast on 21 January 2011. Palmer gave birth earlier than expected, meaning that she started leave three weeks before she planned to. A departure scene and several other key moments were therefore not filmed, and changes had to be made to the storyline to accommodate her absence. Bianca reappeared from December 2011, though Palmer stated in February 2011 that she was in no hurry to return, did not miss it and did not know <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be back. On 19 July 2011, Palmer revealed that she had signed a new 'working mums' contract and would be returning {{before the end of the}} year.|$|E

25|$|Abramovic {{sat in a}} {{rectangle}} drawn with tape in {{the floor of the}} second floor atrium of the MoMA; theater lights shone on her sitting in a chair and a chair opposite her. Visitors waiting in line were invited to sit individually across from the artist while she maintained eye contact with them. Visitors began crowding the atrium within days of the show opening, some gathering before the exhibit opened each morning to rush for a more preferable place in the line to sit with Abramovic. Most visitors sat with the artist for five minutes or less and the line attracted no attention from museum security except for {{the last day of the}} exhibition when a visitor vomited in line and another began to disrobe. Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovic, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovic wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> cry if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovic sat across from 1,545 sitters, including Klaus Biesenbach, James Franco, Lou Reed and Bjork; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to the artist. By the end of the exhibit, hundreds of visitors were lining up outside the museum overnight to secure a spot in line the next morning. Abramovic concluded the performance by slipping from the chair where she was seated and rising to a cheering crowd more than ten people deep.|$|E

The song has a {{sequence}} of G–A7–D–G–A7–D as its chord progression. Lyrically, the song is about someone waking up from a romantic dream at six o'clock on Monday morning, and facing a hectic journey to work <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> prefer to still be enjoying relaxing on Sunday—her [...] "I-don't-have-to-run day". Actor Rudolph Valentino is referred in the first verse.|$|E

500|$|Seacole {{was joined}} by a 14-year-old girl, Sarah, also known as Sally. Soyer {{described}} her as [...] "the Egyptian beauty, Mrs Seacole's daughter Sarah", with blue eyes and dark hair. Nightingale alleged that Sarah was the illegitimate offspring of Seacole and Colonel Henry Bunbury. However, {{there is no evidence}} that Bunbury met Seacole, or even visited Jamaica, at a time <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have been nursing her ailing husband. Ramdin speculates that Thomas Day could have been Sarah's father, pointing to the unlikely coincidences of their meeting in Panama and then in England, and their unusual business partnership in Crimea.|$|E
500|$|Olek changed {{materials}} for a joint exhibition with David E. Peterson in New York City; she used thousands of semi-inflated balloons, crocheted like yarn {{to create a}} cave-like structure inside the gallery. The artist noted her love of the ephemeral nature of the medium; the balloons often popped during {{the creation of the}} installation, and required immediate repair to prevent it unraveling entirely. The installation will gradually wither. She said that balloons represent [...] "the happiest moments in life — which are often just as impermanent". Some visitors noted a pungent scent of latex. Olek was inspired by her time as a traveling clown for Health Plus, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> visit poor New York neighborhoods. She had previously used balloons during her residency in Brazil.|$|E
500|$|As Frances Cleveland {{left the}} White House, {{she told a}} staff member, [...] "Now, Jerry, I {{want you to take}} good care of all the {{furniture}} and ornaments in the house, for I want to find everything just as it is now, when we come back again." [...] When asked <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> return, she responded, [...] "We are coming back four years from today." [...] In the meantime, the Clevelands moved to New York City where Cleveland took a position with the law firm of Bangs, Stetson, Tracy, and MacVeigh. This affiliation was more of an office sharing arrangement, though quite compatible. Cleveland's law practice brought only a moderate income, perhaps because Cleveland spent considerable time at the couple's vacation home Gray Gables at Buzzard Bay, where fishing became his obsession. While they lived in New York, the Clevelands' first child, Ruth, was born in 1891.|$|E

500|$|For {{some of the}} ministers, though, it was not {{sufficient}} for this proud, strong-minded woman {{to submit to the}} humiliation of making a public confession, according to the opinion of Emery Battis. [...] Wilson explored an accusation made by Shepard {{at the end of the}} previous meeting, and new words brought on new assaults. [...] The outcome of her trial was uncertain following the first day's grilling, but her downfall came <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> not acknowledge that she held certain theological errors before her four-month imprisonment. [...] With this, she was accused of lying but, even at this point, Winthrop and a few of the ministers wanted her soul redeemed because of her significant evangelical work before she [...] "set forth her owne stuffe". [...] To these sentiments, Shepard vehemently argued that Hutchinson was a [...] "Notorious Imposter" [...] in whose heart there was never any grace.

500|$|After Beverley's {{death in}} 1756, his son Robert was his {{designated}} heir at law. His wife Elizabeth inherited his plantations in Essex County, including the Blandfield estate and his [...] "slaves, cattle, horses, hogs, and sheep" [...] on the plantations. Beverley divided {{a large part}} of his fortune among his children and their spouses, bequeathing £500 to his daughter Elizabeth and leaving her husband, James Mills, [...] "Money & slaves" [...] valued at £1,000. Ursula also received £500 and her husband, William Fitzhugh, £1,000. Anna was unmarried at the time of Beverley's death; his will instructed Robert to maintain his sister until her marriage or her twenty-first birthday, <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> receive her inheritance. Robert inherited the remainder of the plantations and other lands, including the Beverley Manor tract in Augusta County and lots in the town of Staunton. Beverley Manor, an Augusta County magisterial district south of Staunton, is a namesake of the Beverley Manor patent. After his mother's death Robert also inherited Beverley's Essex County properties, including Blandfield (where he built the present Georgian mansion on the site of his father's residence between 1769 and 1773). Blandfield was owned by Beverley's descendants until its 1983 sale.|$|E

In the process, he lost a year at school, but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies. His wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their marriage, he once said, [...] "As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives." [...] However, as was prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband. Writing many years later, Mohandas described with regret the lustful feelings he felt for his young bride, [...] "even at school I used to think of her, and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting me." [...] He later recalled feeling jealous and possessive of her, such as <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> visit a temple with her girlfriends, and being sexually lustful in his feelings for her.|$|E
500|$|The {{media were}} {{generally}} {{critical of the}} church, presenting it as a cult. The first negative local press articles appeared in 1988, mentioning miraculous healings, proselytism, Kennel's status, fundamentalist beliefs as controversial issues, and included critical reports by former members. Fath noted that the vocabulary and arguments used in the media were intentionally slanted and the repetition of those developed by the CCMM, and that the disproportionate {{media coverage of the}} church did not facilitate an objective investigation. According to a study by an expert in new religious movements, Massimo Introvigne, when a former member destroyed furniture belonging to the church in Langres in July1994, anti-cult associations and some news media took the former member's side, presenting him as the [...] "victim" [...] of a [...] "cult". On the French talk show Ça se discute (broadcast on 25May2005 on France 2), a father (whose nine-year-old daughter {{was a member of the}} church with her mother) said his daughter was brainwashed; he criticized her proselytism at school, closed-mindedness and the role of women in the church. He explained that when he had suffered from cancer two years earlier, she had tried to miraculously heal him; however, she considered him a liar and a sinner because of his homosexuality. He said he found her diary, in which she spoke of her imminent death <b>when</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> reach heaven to meet her grandparents.
