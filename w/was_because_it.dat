5|$|Maureen Ryan {{believed}} {{that one of}} the reasons the episode worked so well <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> left out the storylines with the Night's Watch and the Dothraki and focused in a single location. VanDerWerff agreed, and added that with each episode the writers got bolder in the sense that they added new scenes not included in the book to round out the source material.|$|E

On {{the day of the}} wedding, Elaine tells Jerry that the reason that she was angry <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{was the first time she}} saw him flirt with another woman. They decide that they have to be able to talk more about their {{relationships}} if they wish to remain friends. Elaine then reveals that she has recently met a man using a stake out.|$|E

5|$|Guido Forti {{alleged that}} Shannon Racing had not paid him any money within the stipulated six-day {{deadline}} after {{the deal was}} concluded and refuted the claim that it now owned 51% of his team. As the team ran out of money, it was doubtful whether it would turn up at the British GP. In the end, Forti took part, only for the cars to complete a mere handful of laps each in practice and thus failing to set a time quick enough to qualify. This <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was becoming increasingly in debt to Cosworth and {{was running out of}} engine mileage for its cars, only having enough to make a token effort at participation. The team made it to the next race - the German GP - but both cars remained unassembled in the pit garages throughout the weekend after the engine supply was finally cut off.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-8 {{was named}} the way it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> {{is home to the}} eighth {{planetary}} system confirmed {{during the course of the}} Kepler Mission, a NASA-directed program tasked with searching a region of the sky for terrestrial planets that transit, or cross in front of (and thereby, for a while, make dimmer) the stars that they orbit with respect to Earth. The planet in orbit around Kepler-8, Kepler-8b, was the fifth of the first five planets discovered by the Kepler spacecraft; the first three planets confirmed by Kepler had been previously discovered, and were only used to verify the accuracy of Kepler's measurements. Kepler-8b's discovery was announced to the public on January 4, 2010 at the 215th meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Washington, D.C., alongside planets in orbit around Kepler-4, Kepler-5, Kepler-6, and Kepler-7.|$|E
5|$|The {{defeat and}} death of Richard III at Bosworth field was a double blow for the heralds, for they lost both their patron, the King, and their benefactor, the Earl Marshal, who was also slain. The victorious Henry Tudor was crowned King Henry VII soon after the battle. Henry's first Parliament of 1485 passed an Act of Resumption, in which large grants of crown {{properties}} made by his two predecessors to their supporters were cancelled. Whether this act affected {{the status of the}} College's charter is debatable; however, the act did facilitate the de facto recovery of Coldharbour to the crown. Henry then granted the house to his mother Lady Margaret Beaufort, for life. This <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was supposed that the house was granted personally to John Writhe the Garter King of Arms and not to the heralds as a corporation. As a result, the heralds were left destitute and many of their books and records were lost. Despite this ill treatment from the King, the heralds' position at the royal court remained, and they were compelled by the King to attend him at all times (albeit in rotation).|$|E

5|$|In early 2010, Nomura {{was asked}} in an {{interview}} if Square Enix would release an international Final Mix of Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, to which he replied he would like to, as he enjoyed the work from the English voice casting done in the previous games. However, he stated {{that one of the}} main reasons for the popularity of the Final Mix version of Kingdom Hearts II <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was released alongside the PlayStation 2 remake of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories, so he and the staff would think on it more. In September 2010, Square Enix announced that Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep Final Mix would be released on January 20, 2011 in Japan. Like all Final Mix releases, it combines English audio with Japanese game text and subtitles, and includes all additional features implemented in the Western versions as well as brand new content, such as a new playable secret episode for Aqua, which also has new cutscenes with dialogue provided by her voice actress Megumi Toyoguchi. Alongside The 3rd Birthday, Final Mix includes a code that allows players to obtain downloadable content for Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, with Final Mix featuring the character Cloud Strife costume from the original Kingdom Hearts. Final Mix topped the video game charts following its release with 77,317 units sold in the first week, and reaching 106,276 in February 2011. Final Mix was released for the first time outside Japan as part of Kingdom Hearts HD 2.5 Remix.|$|E

25|$|The 197 power cars {{produced}} {{are numbered}} 43002-43198. 43001 {{was applied to}} the second of the two prototype power cars, while the first of the pair (now preserved and operational at the Great Central Railway (Nottingham)) became 43000, which is unusual because BR TOPS classification numbered its locomotives from 001 upwards (this <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was not, at the time, classified as a locomotive).|$|E

25|$|In 1869, An Dehai, a court eunuch {{and close}} aide of Empress Dowager Cixi, {{was arrested and}} {{executed}} in Shandong Province by Ding Baozhen, the provincial governor. This <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was a capital crime for eunuchs to travel out of the Forbidden City without authorisation. The empress dowager became more suspicious of Prince Gong because she believed that he instigated Ding Baozhen to execute An Dehai.|$|E
25|$|The first {{member of}} the class (4300) was {{purchased}} for parts and dismantled upon arrival in Australia. This <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was cheaper to purchase a complete locomotive than buy the components individually. The first batch of SD70ACe/LCi's (4301-4313) was ordered in 2004 and named after sidings on the BHP system. Since {{it did not have}} the newer, isolated cab of the second and subsequent batches it was traded in to the supplier for locomotives with newer cab assemblies.|$|E
25|$|A {{right-handed}} top order batsman, Lill {{was good}} enough to tour New Zealand in 1959/60 with the Australian national cricket team. He played two matches against New Zealand but they weren't given Test status.

Lill fared poorly in his four innings, scoring 1, 15, 6 and 0.|$|E

25|$|In his speech, he {{stressed}} the importance of being courteous in one’s everyday life as it would make life better for everyone. It was a desirable attribute which could be found in all cultivated societies, and something which we should practice for Singapore’s own self-esteem. If tourists do find Singapore a courteous nation, it <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was ‘incidental’. This ‘prodding’ by Lee Kuan Yew thus saw the birth of the National Courtesy Campaign, which became a recurrent, annual campaign that was seen as a long-term project of aiming to imbue values of courtesy into Singaporeans within a period of 10 years.|$|E

In charge of the attempt to capture Zacharias was Seremet, who had been instructed to capture Zacharias and hand him over to the higher authorities.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{disagreed}} with Yong's fifth argument that an offender {{who did not}} know the amount of pure diamorphine in the substance he was trafficking had not voluntarily assumed the risk of trafficking. A drug trafficker would know his act was illegal and that he would be punished if caught, regardless of his knowledge of the precise amount of pure diamorphine he was trafficking. Yong's sixth argument was also dismissed, the Court explaining that the reason why the trafficking of a quantity of diamorphine greatly exceeding the 15-gram threshold did not incur a more severe sentence <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> would be impossible to impose a punishment more severe than the death penalty.|$|E
25|$|Winston's {{interest}} in the technicalities of coloured glass production led him to take shards of medieval glass to James Powell and Sons of Whitefriars for analyses and reproduction. Winston observed that windows of medieval glass appeared more luminous than those of early 19th-century production, and set his mind to discovering why this was the case. Winston observed that light streaming through a 19th-century window generally made a coloured pattern on the floor. This was rarely the case with medieval glass. He concluded that the reason that 19th-century glass lacked brilliance <b>was</b> <b>because</b> <b>it</b> was too flat and regular, allowing the light to pass through directly. He recommended {{a return to the}} manufacture of hand-made crown and cylinder glass with all their inherent refractive irregularities for the specific purpose of creating stained glass windows.|$|E
