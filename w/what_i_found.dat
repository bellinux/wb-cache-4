500|$|Minogue {{has been}} {{inspired}} by and compared to Madonna throughout her career. Her producer, Pete Waterman, recalled Minogue {{during the early years}} of her success with the observation: [...] "She was setting her sights on becoming the new Prince or Madonna... <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> amazing was that she was outselling Madonna four to one, but still wanted to be her." [...] Minogue received negative comments that her Rhythm of Love tour in 1991 was too similar visually to Madonna's Blond Ambition World Tour, for which critics labelled her a Madonna wannabe. Kathy McCabe for The Telegraph noted that Minogue and Madonna follow similar styles in music and fashion, but concluded, [...] "Where they truly diverge on the pop-culture scale is in shock value. Minogue's clips might draw a gasp from some but Madonna's ignite religious and political debate unlike any other artist on the planet... Simply, Madonna is the dark force; Kylie is the light force." [...] Rolling Stone commented that, with the exception of the US, Minogue is regarded throughout the world as [...] "an icon to rival Madonna", saying, [...] "Like Madonna, Minogue was not a virtuosic singer but a canny trend spotter." [...] Minogue has said of Madonna, [...] "Her huge influence on the world, in pop and fashion, meant that I wasn't immune to the trends she created. I admire Madonna greatly but in the beginning she made it difficult for artists like me, she had done everything there was to be done", and [...] "Madonna's the Queen of Pop, I'm the princess. I'm quite happy with that." [...] Minogue has been declared by media as a sex symbol.|$|E
2500|$|I had {{expected}} to find that [...] was directly responsible for looting and stealing of paintings that he wanted for himself, and I couldn't find any evidence of it, I found evidence that he paid for them; sometimes at knock-down prices, but not direct theft in any way. [...] I was quite surprised by this, and I have to say in all honesty that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>found.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... "I want to {{be careful}} and say that the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office has used race – has illegitimately used race as a factor, {{and to the extent that}} {{constitutes}} racial profiling, that's what it is and that's <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> and the sheriff is saying that people have wrongfully accused him of that as of last Wednesday, which was after the meeting in which he was here.|$|E
5000|$|Later in life, Chad Varah became {{disillusioned with}} the Samaritans organisation. He {{announced}} in 2004 that, [...] "It's no longer <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>founded.</b> <b>I</b> <b>founded</b> an organisation to offer help to suicidal or equally desperate people. The last elected chairman re-branded the organisation. It {{was no longer}} to be an emergency service. It was to be an emotional support".|$|R

One in five calls to Samaritans are from someone with suicidal feelings. Samaritans' vision is that fewer people will die by suicide.|$|R

2500|$|Famously vituperative attacks {{came from}} {{journalist}} H. L. Mencken, whose syndicated columns from Dayton for The Baltimore Sun drew vivid caricatures of the [...] "backward" [...] local populace, {{referring to the}} people of Rhea County as [...] "Babbits", [...] "morons", [...] "peasants", [...] "hill-billies", [...] "yaps", and [...] "yokels". He chastised the [...] "degraded nonsense which country preachers are ramming and hammering into yokel skulls". However, Mencken did enjoy certain aspects of Dayton, writing, [...] "The town, I confess, greatly surprised me. I expected to find a squalid Southern village, with darkies snoozing on the horse-blocks, pigs rooting under the houses and the inhabitants full of hookworm and malaria. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> was a country town full of charm and even beauty—a somewhat smallish but nevertheless very attractive Westminster or Balair." [...] He described Rhea County as priding itself on a kind of tolerance or what he called [...] "lack of Christian heat", opposed to outside ideas but without hating those who held them. He pointed out, [...] "The Klan has never got a foothold here, though it rages everywhere else in Tennessee." [...] Mencken attempted to perpetrate a hoax, distributing flyers for the [...] "Rev. Elmer Chubb", but the claims that Chubb would drink poison and preach in lost languages were ignored as commonplace by the people of Dayton, and only the Commonweal bit. Mencken continued to attack Bryan, including in his famously withering obituary of Bryan, [...] "In Memoriam: W.J.B.", in which he charged Bryan with [...] "insincerity"—not for his religious beliefs but for the inconsistent and contradictory positions he took on a number of political questions during his career. Years later, Mencken did question whether dismissing Bryan [...] "as a quack pure and unadulterated" [...] was [...] "really just". Mencken's columns made the Dayton citizens irate and drew general fire from the Southern press. After Raulston ruled against the admission of scientific testimony, Mencken left Dayton, declaring in his last dispatch, [...] "All that remains of the great cause of the State of Tennessee against the infidel Scopes is the formal business of bumping off the defendant." [...] Consequently, the journalist missed Darrow's cross-examination of Bryan on Monday.|$|E

5000|$|In {{trying to}} explain why soccer cast some sort of spell over him, Gardner has written: [...] "I find in soccer <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have <b>found</b> in life: unpredictability, {{constant}} surprises, and a fascinating contrariness. It is an activity that suggests it has {{a mind of its}} own, one that will tease and disappoint as much as it rewards.|$|R
60|$|This {{knowledge}} I {{soon learned}} by experience, viz. {{that the state}} of things was altered as to matrimony, and that I was not to expect at London <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had <b>found</b> in the country: that marriages were here the consequences of politic schemes for forming interests, and carrying on business, and that Love had no share, or but very little, in the matter.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now let me {{tell you}} <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>found</b> out," [...] said Dickory, [...] "you must know it. These men are wicked robbers. I slipped quietly among them to find out something, with my {{shilling}} in my hand, ready to ask somebody to change, if I was noticed." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{followed}} her advice, {{but even as}} I plied the spoon my thoughts were elsewhere. I was perplexed.
