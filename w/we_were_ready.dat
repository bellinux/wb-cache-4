500|$|Hillenburg and Derek Drymon {{had dinner}} {{and came up}} with the idea for [...] "Help Wanted" [...] based on an {{experience}} Hillenburg had in the Boy Scouts. Hillenburg and writer Hill worked it into an outline. In 1997, while pitching the cartoon to Nickelodeon executives, Hillenburg donned a Hawaiian shirt, brought along an [...] "underwater terrarium with models of the characters," [...] and Hawaiian music to set the theme. The setup was described by Nickelodeon executive Eric Coleman as [...] "pretty amazing". When given money and two weeks to write the pilot episode, Drymon, Hillenberg and Jennings returned with what Nickelodeon official Albie Hecht described as [...] "a performance [...] wish [...] had on tape". Although described as stressful by creative director Derek Drymon, the pitch went [...] "very well"; Kevin Kay and Hecht had to step outside because they were [...] "exhausted from laughing," [...] making the cartoonists worried. With a help from Hill and art director Nick Jennings, Hillenburg finished the pitch and sold SpongeBob SquarePants to Nickelodeon. Drymon said [...] "the network approved it—so <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> to go." ...|$|E
500|$|Aspinall later commented {{about his}} first meeting with George Harrison, who also {{attended}} the Liverpool Institute: [...] "My first encounter with George was behind the school’s air-raid shelters. [...] This great mass of shaggy hair loomed up and an out-of-breath voice requested a quick drag of my Woodbine. It {{was one of the first}} cigarettes either of us had smoked. We spluttered our way through it bravely but gleefully. After that the three of us did lots of ridiculous things together.... By the time <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> to take the GCE exams we added John Lennon to our 'Mad Lad' gang. He was doing his first term at Liverpool College of Art which overlooks the Liverpool Institute playground and we all got together in a students coffee bar at lunchtime." [...] Aspinall took nine GCEs at the Institute and passed eight of them, but failed the French exam. He left school in July 1959, and studied accountancy. [...] Aspinall worked for a Liverpool company for two years, receiving a wage of £2-10s–0d. (£2.50 decimal equivalent) per week as a trainee accountant.|$|E

2500|$|A {{detailed}} description of conditions in the camps is provided by Varlam Shalamov in his Kolyma Tales. In Dry Rations he writes: [...] "Each time they brought in the soup... it made us all want to cry. <b>We</b> <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> to cry for fear that the soup would be thin. And when a miracle occurred and the soup was thick we couldn’t believe it and ate it as slowly as possible. But even with thick soup in a warm stomach there remained a sucking pain; we’d been hungry for too long. All human emotions—love, friendship, envy, concern for one’s fellow man, compassion, longing for fame, honesty— had left us with the flesh that had melted from our bodies...." ...|$|E
2500|$|No, we're {{all done}} with that [...] now, all the old material.

You have to have a different brain when you're doing a record like that. It's more about [...] "this is your achievement"; I could hold in one hand all the records we've released, so that was cool.

2500|$|We weren't {{trying not}} {{to put out a}} record. It was just one thing after another and time flew by. When you don't do your band like a career like us, you've got other things to do than worry about getting records made. If you don't put a {{deadline}} on it, it may never get done. Like us, you turn around and it's been six years. The first year or two after the last record, we were still touring and not thinking about making an album. Then, in the third year, we were busy and it took a few months to write and get in the studio. There's lag time at the label and then it's winter... It just goes on and on. When NOFX asked us if we wanted to go on the road with them, {{we thought it would be}} fun, but we thought it would be better if we had the record finished. We hadn't planned on being done in October. It was for later in the year, so we had to kick it in high gear and get into the studio. Everything worked backwards from there 'cause if we had fucked it up, we'd be looking at 2009 before the album was done. That deadline really got it all together, but it was only a matter of a few weeks. We'd planned to go into the studio three weeks after we actually did. We'd have only rehearsed with the luxury time, so <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>ready.</b> Most of [...] the last 12 months, so it's a new record, not stuff we were sitting on and hadn't recorded. It's also not like we were writing these songs for the last six years. Once <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>ready,</b> it came together surprisingly quickly, and I think people will be kind of shocked but happy with the results.|$|E
2500|$|Instead of tending {{towards a}} vast Alexandrian library {{the world has}} become a computer, an {{electronic}} brain, exactly as an infantile piece of science fiction. And as our senses have gone outside us, Big Brother goes inside. So, unless aware of this dynamic, we shall at once move into a phase of panic terrors, exactly befitting a small world of tribal drums, total interdependence, and superimposed co-existence. [...] Terror is the normal state of any oral society, for in it everything affects everything all the time. [...] In our long striving to recover for the Western world a unity of sensibility and of thought and feeling we have no more been prepared to accept the tribal consequences of such unity than <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> for the fragmentation of the human psyche by print culture.|$|E

At their arrival, they were subject to the hostility of the inhabitants because of the Destour propaganda to discredit them. However, they found support in Ahmad Ayad, a Ksar Hellal notable, who invited them to hold a gathering and explain themselves. The meeting happened in his house on January 3, 1934. Soon, their speeches and determination to act proved to be successful and pleased the inhabitants. Belgacem Gnaoui, then leader of the carter union and who would become the General secretary of the General Confederation of Tunisian Workers, testified that [...] "at the slightest sign, <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> to close our shops and march in the streets [...] Young people urged us to protest strikes. On day, Ahmad Essafi, General secretary of the Destour, convened a gathering in the Andalous quarter. He was violently attacked by the participants who accused him of enjoying the comfort while we were starving in our hovels".|$|E

2500|$|Ortmann is most {{remembered for}} his role in the famed 1950 Snow Bowl game against Ohio State, in which he punted 24 times in a {{blizzard}} for 723 yards – still a Michigan record. The weather conditions were so inclement that Michigan punted on first down for its first two plays from scrimmage, after concluding that the best strategy was to keep the slick ball on the other side of the field and in the hands of Ohio State. The strategy worked, as the game's only touchdown was scored after Ortman punted the ball out of bounds at the Ohio State six-yard line, Ohio State was forced to punt from deep in its own territory, and Tony Momsen recovered a blocked punt in the endzone. Ortmann recalled: “You and I would not have gone outside to get the newspaper on a day like that. [...] But here we were, trying to play football.” Michigan did not get a first down and had only 27 yards of total offense, while Ortman was 0 for 8 passing and gained only 9 yards in 10 rushing attempts. The fierce weather conditions stifled both offenses, and the Wolverines managed to win 9-3 on a safety and Momsen's touchdown after the blocked punt. Interviewed about the Snow Bowl in 2006, Ortmann, then retired and living in Savannah, Georgia, recalled: [...] "Twice during the game, playing as the safety, I couldn't see [...] Vic Janowicz and his backfield, the snow was falling so heavily. Tony Momsen was our regular punter and as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>ready</b> to go out, he said, ‘Charlie, I don't feel like punting today, you punt.' I hadn't punted in three months. But the hero of that game was not Chuck Ortmann, it was Carl Kreager, our center. I just put my hands down and the ball was always there. I still remind him every time we talk, 'Carl, you never got enough credit for that game.' It was so boring. I have a film of the game, and I haven't watched it since, if that tells you something." ...|$|E
