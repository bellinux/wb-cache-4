25|$|The crisis, which {{eventually}} became {{the catalyst for}} the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, almost developed into a run on money funds: the redemptions caused a drop in demand for commercial paper, preventing companies from rolling over their short-term debt, potentially causing an acute liquidity crisis: if companies cannot issue new debt to repay maturing debt, {{and do not have}} cash on hand to pay it back, they <b>will</b> <b>default</b> on their obligations, and may have to file for bankruptcy. Thus there was concern that the run could cause extensive bankruptcies, a debt deflation spiral, and serious damage to the real economy, as in the Great Depression.|$|E

2500|$|The {{problem lies}} {{if one of}} the {{companies}} in the chain fails, creating a [...] "domino effect" [...] of losses.

2500|$|In {{the credit}} default swap (CDS) market, the {{standard}} contracts typically used between parties to a swap define the action of placing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into conservatorship to be equivalent to bankruptcy, because {{of the change in}} management control. In CDS parlance, this is termed a credit event, and that triggers the settling of outstanding contracts for the derivatives, which are used to hedge or speculate on the potential risk that a company <b>will</b> <b>default</b> on its bonds. The two GSEs have approximately US$1.5 trillion in bonds outstanding, and since the market in {{credit default swap}}s is not public, there is no central reporting mechanism to verify how many credit default swaps are linked to those bonds. One estimate floated is US$500 billion, and that the entire [...] CDS market has a notional value in the vicinity of US$62 trillion.|$|E
