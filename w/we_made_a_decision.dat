The main reason we choose {{this technology is}} to access the system through many different computing platforms. Present web browsers take care for the right support of using before mentioned technology. With the new element canvas we can manipulate and display the remote computer. To manipulate the system we just add event listeners for mouse, keyboard and touch events on the element. Technology WebSockets served as a communication between the server and client. Mainly it was used for sending proper data and information about the remote desktop. The implementation of both mentioned technologies was controlled with scripting language Javascript. There are many different operating systems {{to be used as}} a web server. In consideration, the server must have the proper support for implementing WebSockets with explicit programming language.

40|$|In engineering, we {{constantly}} {{need to make}} decisions: which {{design to}} select, which parameters to select for this design, etc. The traditional approach to decision making {{is based on the}} assumption that we know all possible consequences of each alternative, and we know the probability of each such consequence. Under this assumption, we can describe a rational decision-making process: to each possible consequence, we assign a numerical values called its utility, and we select the alternative for which the expected value of the utility is the largest. An important advantage of this approach is that it can be performed in real time: if after <b>we</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> <b>decision,</b> a new alternative appears, we do not need to repeat the whole analysis again: all we need to do is compare the new alternative with the previously selected ones. In the past, when we used the same procedures year after year, we accumulated a lot of data about the consequences of different decisions [...] based from which we could estimate the desired probabilities. Nowadays, with new technologies, new materials constantly emerging, we do not have such detailed information about the consequences of these new technologies. As a result, we often only have partial information about the corresponding probabilities. Different possible probability values result in different values of expected utility. Hence, for each alternative, instead of a single value of expected utility, we have a range (interval) of possible values. We need to make a decision under such interval uncertainty. In this paper, we describe when we can make decisions under interval uncertainty in linear time and in real time [...] and when we cannot...|$|E

Likewise, <b>we</b> have <b>made</b> <b>an</b> &dquo;executive&dquo; <b>decision,</b> based on our review of the literature, to equate the terms manager and leader. We feel supported in this decision by the research and sage advice of our colleague Senior Fellow Walt Denero, of The University of Georgia Fanning Leadership Center, and the writings of Bennis and Nanus (1985), among other respected scholars in the field of leadership development. The topic of women’s place in leadership cries out for additional exploration. We fully expect and hope that our observations may be unsettling [...] even controversial [...] to you. But we welcome questions and debate and invite you to add to our knowledge and understanding of this exciting field of study.

5000|$|On October 23, 2013, Moszkowicz told The Hollywood Reporter that {{production}} on the sequel would resume in 2014, explaining that Constantin {{was determined to}} continue the franchise due to the positive response from fans to the adaptation, though noted that the marketing campaign for City of Bones was too narrowly focused on teenage fans, {{proving to be a}} detriment of Clare's older readers. Moszkowciz also admitted that nothing had been finalized nor confirmed, saying [...] "It is an ongoing discussion that we are having, and it is not done. <b>We</b> haven't <b>made</b> <b>a</b> final <b>decision.</b> But <b>we</b> will only move forward — and we plan to move forward — when we feel {{we are going to get}} it right". Moszkowicz later revealed the intention to shoot the film at some time in 2014. On May 20, 2014, Harald Zwart revealed that the studio still had intentions to make the sequel, but explained that he would not direct it, so that he could focus on other projects, although he complimented the first film as [...] "a good window him to show off".|$|R
40|$|Background: Access to {{diagnosis}} and dialysis for acute kidney injury can be life-saving, {{but can be}} prohibitively expensive in low-income settings. The burden of acute kidney injury in sub-Saharan Africa is presumably high but remains unknown. We did a systematic review to assess outcomes of acute kidney injury in sub-Saharan Africa and identify barriers to care. Methods: We searched PubMed, African Journals Online, WHO Global Health Library, and Web of Science for articles published between Jan 1, 1990, and Nov 30, 2014. We scored studies, and all were of medium-to-low quality. <b>We</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> pragmatic <b>decision</b> to include all studies to best reflect reality, and did a descriptive analysis of extracted data. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD 42015015690. Findings: We identified 3881 records, of which 41 met inclusion criteria, including 1403 adult patients and 1937 paediatric patients. Acute kidney injury in sub-Saharan Africa is severe, with 1042 (66 %) of 1572 children and 178 (70 %) 253 of adults needing dialysis in studies reporting dialysis need. Only 666 (64 %) of 1042 children (across 11 studies) and 58 (33 %) of 178 adults (across four studies) received dialysis when needed. Overall mortality was 34 % in children and 32 % in adults, but rose to 73 % in children and 86 % in adults when dialysis was needed but not received. Major barriers to access to care were out-of-pocket costs, erratic hospital resources, late presentation, and female sex. Interpretation: Patients in these studies are those with resources to access care. In view of overall study quality, data interpretation should be cautious, but high mortality and poor access to dialysis are concerning. The global scarcity of resources among patients and health centres highlights {{the need for a}} health-system-wide approach to prevention and management of acute kidney injury in sub-Saharan Africa. Funding: None...|$|R
40|$|Way {{back in the}} 1960 s, an era {{in which}} many people think we are still mired, <b>we</b> each <b>made</b> <b>a</b> career <b>decision</b> to be lawyers for poor people. While the road over the past thirty-five years has taken several twists and turns, we are still lawyers for poor people. When we started on this road, we {{believed}} that we were making a political decision—that lawyering on behalf of poor people meant representing the oppressed against entrenched interests, including the state. While we may no longer say things like 2 ̆ 2 when the revolution comes 2 ̆ 2 (well, sometimes we do), we still believe that choosing to represent the poor is a political choice with dramatic consequences in the nature of one 2 ̆ 7 s work. Adam Babich may disagree, but the work of the Tulane Law School 2 ̆ 7 s Environmental Law Clinic proves our point. Professor Babich describes the clinic 2 ̆ 7 s environmentalist work on behalf of the unenfranchised and calls it apolitical. It is a little bit like buying a gold fish and telling everyone about your pet dog. You can call it what you want, but you should not expect others to take it for a walk...|$|R
