5|$|As Harry learns {{more about}} his great enemy, the love lives of the main {{characters}} start to become more active. Ron and Hermione grow closer together, but after learning from his sister Ginny that Hermione had previously kissed Viktor Krum, Ron shuns her. Harry's attempts to repair things between the two fail, resulting in Ron going out with Lavender Brown and making Hermione jealous. After Ron is nearly killed in an attempt on Dumbledore's life, he and Hermione reconcile. Ron and Lavender break up when Lavender sees {{the two of them}} <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boys dormitories together. However, this was only because she hadn't noticed Harry walking ahead of them. Harry develops feelings for Ginny, but is reluctant to pursue her for most of the year because of his friendship with Ron. Following a wild Quidditch victory Harry and Ginny finally strike up a relationship, with Ron's reluctant consent.|$|E
5|$|Malcolm tells Adrienne about {{a ritual}} that can {{eradicate}} the demon. Harriet, fearing for her safety, decides {{to leave with}} Cyrus as Don becomes more abusive and erratic. The next day, Adrienne is attacked by Don, who is now completely insane and dressed like Carno. Adrienne scars Don's face with acid from his darkroom and then flees, discovering the corpses of Mike, Harriet and Cyrus hidden throughout the mansion. Don captures Adrienne and straps her into the throne, but she distracts him long enough to free herself and trigger the swinging axe, which impales and kills Don. His death unleashes the demon, a huge and murderous monster that pursues Adrienne through the mansion. She escapes long enough to perform a ritual that traps the demon once again. The game ends with Adrienne <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mansion with a vacant stare, almost catatonic.|$|E
5|$|The band {{embarked}} {{on what would}} become a 103 show world tour {{in support of the}} album {{over a period of several}} months in 1995 and 1996. The tour started on 22 June 1995 with a pre-Glastonbury festival warm up gig at the 1,400 capacity Bath Pavilion, which featured the debut of new drummer Alan White and several new songs off the album, and ended on 4 December 1996 at the 11,800 capacity Mayo Civic Centre in Rochester, Minnesota, USA, and included concerts at Earls Court in November 1995 and Cardiff International Arena in March 1996. The tour had many disruptions and cancellations due to Noel twice <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group, and Liam pulling out of a US leg.|$|E

5|$|The video {{starts with}} a coin dropped onto ground after which a title card that reads Roberts' name and the track title is shown. As the title changes color, Roberts walks and skips down a New York City street wearing a floral T-shirt dress. Effects are placed on Roberts' with sperm cells graffitied on it shadow her {{movement}} with neon colors and throughout becomes increasingly prominent, and during the second verse Roberts performs a short dance movement with two back-up dancers before she walks past a wall with sperm graffitied on it, which also changes to multiple neon colours. As the video progresses, Roberts interacts with buildings and objects, such as New York style newspaper dispensers and following this her entire body has effects placed upon it as she changes color and shades and the last frames of the video show {{more of the same}} effects and finally shows a frame of a New York street with Roberts <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> frame before the camera moves upwards to show a purple sky.|$|E
5|$|Interviewed by Wallace, McHenry admits being angry after {{discovering}} his girlfriend's infidelity but denies {{that the blood}} on his clothing is hers. Montgomery tries to convince King to report her rape; King refuses, telling Montgomery {{that she does not}} understand {{what it is like to}} be raped. Wilder uses alternative medicine to help King deal with her pain. Psychiatrist Violet Turner (Amy Brenneman) refuses to talk to King about the rape because of similarities to the fetal abduction she experienced a year earlier, and wonders if everyone in the practice is cursed. Bennett wants to go home and rest, which angers Montgomery. King attempts to compose a memorandum saying that she was attacked on the hospital grounds, but Freedman suggests that another member of the staff do it for her; she shouts at Freedman when he calls her a victim. After the argument, Freedman goes to King's office and weeps when he sees the aftermath of her assault. McHenry admits raping a woman, assaulting Wallace before he is pulled away by the police. In the ambulance bay, Bennett expresses his confusion about Montgomery's mood swings and suspects that she is hiding something from him; Montgomery asks him to promise never to leave her alone. After Freedman helps her dress, King says that she loves him and wants to go home. McHenry is held by the police for assaulting a police officer during his arrest and Wallace during his interrogation, but detective Joe Price says that McHenry cannot be charged with rape until charges are filed against him. The episode ends with King <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hospital with Freedman's help; flashbacks of the rape reveal that McHenry was the rapist.|$|E
25|$|During the task, {{a massive}} {{argument}} flared up when Sharon {{felt she was}} being sidelined in Invicta's decision making, despite the fact she had the most experience of the fashion industry, and accused her teammates of ganging up on her, angering Paul and Syed, the latter disgusted by this after <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> argument. After refusing {{to take an active}} role in the task on the second day, she quickly changed her mind after realising that Nick and Margaret were both watching her.|$|E

25|$|Nonetheless, {{the tour}} was a {{disaster}} for India. The team lost the Test series 1–0 (with the last two matches drawn), and the ODI series 2–0 (with no result in the first match due to rain). The rest of the tour saw victories in a single-innings match against the Duke of Norfolk's XI and limited-overs matches against an England National Cricket Association XI and Middlesex, but also defeats in a limited-overs match against Northamptonshire and a first-class match against Derbyshire. The tour was also marred by a spat between Azharuddin and opener Navjot Singh Sidhu, {{which resulted in the}} latter <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tour after the 2nd ODI. Following the tour, Azharuddin, who was also facing personal problems at the time, was sacked as captain.|$|E
25|$|Jayawardene's One Day International debut {{was against}} Zimbabwe at Premadasa in January 1998. Sri Lanka won the match, with Jayawardene hitting the winning run. In {{the next game}} Jayawardene scored 74. It took only 11 matches before he scored his first century, which was against England in the Carlton and United World Series game at Adelaide. Jayawardene entered a {{pressure}} situation, with Sri Lanka struggling at 134/4 in the run chase, but made an innings of 120 runs to win the match. The match is notable for Ross Emerson's no-balling of Muttiah Muralitharan for throwing, which led the Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga to lead his team {{to the edge of}} the field and consider <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> match, as well as physical shoulder-barging by some players.|$|E

[...] "You are the most impertinent person I ever knew in my life," [...] said Augusta, rising from her chair and <b>walking</b> slowly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room.

25|$|Gonzalez's critics {{considered}} him a stubborn and willful ideologue. When the Board {{put forth a}} resolution commending San Franciscan Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi for being elected House Minority Whip and being {{the first woman to}} hold that position, Gonzalez was the only board member who voted against it. Gonzalez said that supervisors should not issue commendations for winning partisan political positions and that he had written a personal note to Pelosi congratulating her, as she had done him for being elected board president. Gonzalez refused to meet with Brown during his first two years on the Board of Supervisors, saying he did so to avoid being subject to Brown's influence rather than as a matter of disrespect. Two sources reported that Gonzalez defied Brown by <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mayor's State of the City address in 2002. However, Gonzalez later told SF Weekly that he was never in attendance.|$|E
25|$|Entering {{the fight}} {{as a very}} heavy underdog, Evans shocked the world by {{knocking}} out former light heavyweight champion Chuck Liddell in brutal fashion at UFC 88. Liddell threw an uppercut that Evans countered with an overhand right, landing flush. Liddell remained unconscious for several minutes before finally <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cage under his own power. The knockout was awarded knockout {{of the year by}} Sherdog for 2008. Evans had previously been scheduled to face Liddell at UFC 85 as a replacement for the injured Mauricio Rua. When Liddell pulled out of the event due to an injured hamstring, Evans was matched with James Irvin. When Irvin pulled out after breaking his foot, the fight was removed from the card altogether. After the fight, UFC President Dana White confirmed in the post-event press conference that Evans' next fight would be a title shot against newly crowned light heavyweight champion Forrest Griffin at UFC 92.|$|E
25|$|Fox Film {{songwriter}} Jay Gorney was <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{viewing of}} Temple's last Frolics of Youth picture {{when he saw}} her dancing in the movie theater lobby. Recognizing her from the screen, he arranged for her to have a screen test for the movie Stand Up and Cheer! Temple arrived for the audition on December 7, 1933; she won the part and was signed to a $150-per-week contract that was guaranteed for two weeks by Fox Film Corporation. The role was a breakthrough performance for Temple. Her charm was evident to Fox executives, and she was ushered into corporate offices almost immediately after finishing Baby Take a Bow, a song and dance number she did with James Dunn. On December 21, 1933, her contract was extended to a year at the same $150/week with a seven-year option and her mother Gertrude was hired on at $25/week as her hairdresser and personal coach. Released in May 1934, Stand Up and Cheer! became Shirley's breakthrough film. Within months, she became the symbol of wholesome family entertainment. In June, her success continued when she was loaned out to Paramount for Little Miss Marker.|$|E

He had just time to recognise the street as his goal, the High Street, when somebody, <b>walking</b> unexpectedly <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corner house, stood directly in his path. Fenn could not stop himself. He charged the man squarely, clutched him to save himself, and they fell in a heap on the pavement.|$|R

25|$|The {{music video}} {{is set in}} three {{different}} locations: a hotel lobby, a bedroom, and on the beach. Although it was originally reported that both winners would appear in the video, only one was finally chosen to star. The others {{can be seen in}} minor roles as guests and workers in the lobby. The video chronicles the romance and conflict between the singer and his love interest, while making heavy use of visual art, with each scene presented as a watercolour painting, while in the intervals close-ups of Rouvas singing in front of a black background are shown. Additional artwork is shown of the surrounding environment, including buildings, the night sky, and birds flying across the sky. Throughout the video a live action/animation effect called rotoscoping is utilized, a first in Greek cinematography. It begins with Rouvas asleep and moves to him and his love interest sitting in a hotel lobby while the assistant brings over their luggage. They appear to be in a conflict, facing different directions. They then appear on the beach on better terms, while advertisements for the song's sponsor, Trident, are shown when the two characters each take a stick of gum. Snippets of love scenes are also played, while in some parts they are each shown separately and close-up shots show the woman's make-up smeared from crying, while animated tears also run down her face. During the bridge the two finally face each other in the lobby scene and as they lean in to kiss the rotoscoping animation momentarily smooths out. This is followed by another love scene and ends with the two <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> room.|$|E
25|$|The Undertaker {{then began}} a storyline where he teamed with Big Show in a tag team known as The Unholy Alliance, which held the WWF World Tag Team Championship twice. After their victory at SummerSlam, The Undertaker {{suffered}} a groin tear and was seen limping in several matches. He avoided competing in wrestling matches {{in the following}} weeks, instead tyrannically ordering Big Show to fight all his battles and oblige all his many wishes. He also began to transition away to the biker character he would play in 2000. Per an interview with Kevin Nash, this was a move to allow Calaway to enter World Championship Wrestling with a non-trademarked persona. Had he entered WCW, {{it would have been}} as Mark Calaway. Although negotiations were described as close, he ultimately re-signed with the World Wrestling Federation. To compensate for his lack of physical action, Undertaker became more vocal on the mic, often making smart-aleck remarks and providing commentary. In September 1999, on SmackDown!, Mr. McMahon threatened that he would remove Undertaker from the Unforgiven main event if he refused to participate in a casket match against Triple H. Undertaker retorted that he did not care and maybe he would not be participating in anything, thus <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WWF. In reality, Calaway went on a hiatus from the WWF in order to treat his groin injury. On December 14 he made his return to action, teaming with Viscera in a losing effort against Kane and The Godfather at a house show in Caomo, Puetro Rico. The Undertaker was advertised on the Armageddon promotional poster to return, but meanwhile also tore his pectoral muscle, making him take almost eight months out of action.|$|E

The Beatles spent over 220 hours recording Revolver – a figure that excludes mixing sessions, and compares with less than 80 hours for Rubber Soul. Final mixing of the album took place on 22 June. The Beatles celebrated the project's completion by attending the opening of Sibylla's, a nightclub in which Harrison had a financial stake.|$|E

500|$|The prosecution's case rested {{largely on}} the {{testimony}} of two men who had pleaded guilty to participating in the holdup. The prosecution called four witnesses: Avon White and John Rivers (both of whom had already been convicted of the robbery) and the manager and teller of the bank. White and Rivers, although convicted, {{had not yet been}} sentenced for the robbery and were promised that the charges would be dropped in exchange for their testimony. White and Rivers testified that Shakur had guarded one of the doors with a [...]357 magnum pistol and that Sadiki had served as a lookout and drove the getaway truck during the robbery; neither White nor Rivers was cross-examined due to the defense attorney's refusal to participate in the trial. Shakur's aunt and lawyer, Evelyn Williams, was also cited for contempt after <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> courtroom after many of her attempted motions were denied.

500|$|In early drafts, Cloud {{would act}} as an alter ego for Sephiroth, {{influenced}} {{to believe he was}} a creation of Sephiroth's will. As in the finished game, Cloud would later realize that he is the real Cloud, and that the reason Sephiroth could control his mind and body was because of his weakened will and Shinra's experiments. Additionally, Cloud would have scarred Tifa prior to the game's events, although the reasons for as to why were unknown. Early materials listed Cloud's job as [...] and [...] Masato Kato, one of the event planners, proposed a scene involving Cloud <b>walking</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Highwind's Chocobo stable followed by Tifa the morning before the final battle. Kitase rejected it as too extreme, but maintained a scene written by Kato depicting the night before, in which a risqué line is spoken by Tifa followed by a fade to black. In an interview, Nojima stated that none of the staff thought it would become an important issue at the time.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Gates {{appeared}} {{in a series of}} ads to promote Microsoft.

[...] The salesman is trying to sell Mr. Gates shoes that are a size too big. As Gates is buying the shoes, he holds up his discount card, which uses a slightly altered version of his own mugshot of his arrest in New Mexico in 1977, for a traffic violation.
