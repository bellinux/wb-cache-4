2500|$|In November 2016, President Duterte {{confirmed}} the Maute group's {{affiliation with the}} Islamic State. Amidst fierce fighting in Butig on November 30, 2016, Duterte, in a command briefing in Lanao del Sur, warned the Maute group: [...] "Ayaw ko makipag-away sa inyo. Ayaw ko makipag-patayan, (I {{do not want a}} fight with you. I don't want us killing each other) but please, do not force my hand. I cannot be forever traveling here every month para lang makipag-usap (just to talk), at pagtalikod ko patayan nanaman (and when I turn around, there's killing again). I do not <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> anything, but please do not force my hand into it." [...] On December 2, 2016, as the military regained control of Butig, the retreating Maute fighters reportedly left a note threatening to behead Duterte.|$|E
2500|$|Since the mid-1990s, {{the program}} {{production}} company {{and in some}} cases the executive producer (both Barker and Richards, the executive producer since September 2009) have been sued by numerous women. Most of the lawsuits involved models and other staff members in cases of sexual harassment, wrongful termination and racial discrimination. Allegations of sexual harassment brought by Parkinson led to Barker calling a press conference to admit a past consensual sexual relationship with her, while denying any harassment and alleging instead that she was only angry with him for calling off the relationship. Barker was widowed in 1981 following the death of his wife, Dorothy Jo. It has also been alleged that Barker and senior staff created a hostile work environment, particularly to those who testified for the plaintiffs suing Barker. Responding to the controversy just before his retirement, Barker told William Keck of USA Today, [...] " [...] been such a problem. I don't want to say anything about them. They [...] disgusting; I don't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> them." [...] The Barker-era lawsuits, except for one, were settled out of court. After Barker dropped his slander suit against Hallstrom, she eventually countersued and received millions in settlement. There are two lawsuits in litigation: a pregnancy discrimination suit involving Sherwood and a sexual harassment suit involving Lanisha Cole, filed in September 2011.|$|E

5|$|In the United Kingdom, The Scout Association {{had been}} criticised for its {{insistence on the}} use of a {{religious}} promise, leading to the introduction of an alternative in January 2014 for those not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> a god in their promise. This change making the organisation entirely non-discriminatory on the grounds of race, gender, sexuality, and religion (or lack thereof).|$|R

50|$|O'Rourke in November 2010 {{said there}} was then more to unite her party and Fine Gael than to divide them. She pointed to the common {{approach}} of the two parties to Northern Ireland, Europe and the current financial crisis. In {{an address to the}} 1916-1921 Club in Dublin Castle last night, the Longford-Westmeath TD said that most voters no longer defined themselves in terms of Civil War politics. Having pointed to the shared values of the two parties on a number of issues, she said the last issue she <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> was the “dreaded b” word.|$|R

It could have been Seattle or Miami but we chose New York City and Los Angeles, and he suggested Detroit and Houston because they both were economically part of the basis of our economy—Motortown and the oil industry, so I just poetically wrote that in the bridge." ...|$|R

50|$|At a diner, Scam informs Obie {{that his}} own father is {{actually}} alive. According to Scam, his father went south {{to look for work}} after his parents divorced. His mother died 3 months previously and he has been on his own ever since. Having only his father's old driver's license, Scam vows to find him. At this point, Obie now considers Scam his friend as he heads home. The next morning, the Dawkins are visited by the police {{to find out what happened}} to Obie. Obie lies, claiming he caught amnesia and does not remember. Not <b>wanting</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> his bike was stolen Obie has his mom take him to school.|$|R

[...] "There is a {{wild man}} up there, but I don't {{think he will}} bother us any, and we've got {{too much to do}} to hunt for him."

6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{she said}} slowly, [...] "there is {{something}} I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention.</b> I fancy Mr. Burnell has {{a favor to}} ask of you this evening, and it might, perhaps, be wise to oblige him.

"Well," [...] said Jordan dryly, [...] "the {{only use}} I ever {{had for the}} bush was as a place for growing saw-logs; but while talk of this kind {{has nothing to do}} with business, there's {{something}} I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention.</b> I met Austerly not long ago, and he wants to see you and Jim Wheelock when you can make it convenient, Valentine.

50|$|Merutunga, on {{the other}} hand, states that Bhima's three sons were Mularaja, Karna and Haripala. Of these, Haripala was born of a courtesan named Bakuladevi. Historian A. K. Majumdar theorizes that Merutunga's account {{appears to be more}} accurate, since {{voluntary}} rejections of thrones were very rare. Hemachandra, who was a royal courtier, probably <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> avoid <b>mentioning</b> the illegitimate son Haripala, and therefore, glossed over the genealogy.|$|R
500|$|Chrysippus {{came to be}} renowned {{as one of the}} {{foremost}} logicians of ancient Greece. When Clement of Alexandria <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> one who was master among logicians, as Homer was master among poets, it was Chrysippus, not Aristotle, he chose. Diogenes Laërtius wrote: [...] "If the gods use dialectic, they would use none other than that of Chrysippus." [...] The logical work by Chrysippus came to be neglected and forgotten. Aristotle's logic prevailed, partly because it was seen as more practical, and partly because it was taken up by the Neoplatonists. As recently as the 19th century, Stoic logic was treated with contempt, a barren formulaic system, which was merely clothing the logic of Aristotle with new terminology. It was not until the 20th century, with the advances in logic, and the modern propositional calculus, that it became clear that Stoic logic constituted a significant achievement.|$|R

"Oak," [...] said Boldwood, [...] "before you go I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> {{what has}} been passing in my mind lately--that little {{arrangement}} we made about your share in the farm I mean. That share is small, too small, considering how little I attend to business now, and how much time and thought you give to it. Well, since the world is brightening for me, I want to show my sense of it by increasing your proportion in the partnership. I'll make a memorandum of the arrangement which struck me {{as likely to be}} convenient, for I haven't time to talk about it now; and then we'll discuss it at our leisure. My intention is ultimately to retire from the management altogether, and until you can take all the expenditure upon your shoulders, I'll be a sleeping partner in the stock. Then, if I marry her--and I hope--I feel I shall, why--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Easy Chair wouldn't give me {{room for}} it. But I'll tell you {{something}} else. When I was a boy I had a knack at versing, which came rather {{in anticipation of the}} subjects to use it on. I exhausted Spring and Morning and Snow and Memory, and the whole range of mythological topics, and then I had my knack lying idle. I observed that there was one subject that the other poets found inexhaustible, but somehow I felt myself disqualified for treating it. How could I sing of Love when I had never been in love? For I didn't count those youthful affairs when I was only in the Third Reader and {{the first part of the}} Arithmetic. I went about trying to be in love, as a matter of business; but I couldn't manage it. Suddenly it managed itself; and then I found myself worse disqualified than ever. I didn't <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> it; either to myself or to her, much less to the world at large. It seemed a little too personal." ...|$|E

"In one way, it's not a {{very big}} thing we have done, boys," [...] he said; and Laura was quick to notice the {{significance}} of the fact, which was also characteristic of the country, that he counted himself as one of them.

It's another round with Nature, and we've got her down again. It's a thing you have to do west of the Rockies, or she'll crush the life out of you. There are folks in the Eastern cities who call her beneficent; but they don't quite understand what was laid on man in Eden long ago. Here he's up against flood and frost and snow. Well, I guess we've done about all we can, and now that I've paid my respects to the chopper and carpenter-gang, there's another man I <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention.</b> He took hold of the contract to put us up our dam, and kept hold through the blamedest kind of luck. There's hard grit in him and the boys he led, and the river couldn't wash it out of them. Well, when the big turbines are humming and the mill's grinding out money for all of you, I guess you're going to remember the boys who built the dam." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Soviet Science Academy {{ended up}} with a leader of the {{philosophy}} department who was placed there simply to keep the man out of trouble. The government decided to not execute or send the famous writer to the gulag because he had won the Stalin award. Doing this would have discredited the Stalin award and thus Stalin the leader of the Communist party himself. So instead, the Soviet Science Academy would have Georgii Aleksandrov work for them placing him as a department head because they believed there that he could be more easily controlled and kept within party parameters in regards to his behavior and speech. They did so because he attempted to publish works and write about topics that were considered questionable. The topic which he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> write about were philosophers who were not the four main Communist philosophers he <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>mention</b> the Western philosophers in his writings. This was decided to be inappropriate and his proposal was refused by the authorities. They then decided that {{it would be best to}} demote him from his current position of research and place him as a head of department at the Soviet Science Academy because it was considered a lesser position where he could be kept out of further mischief.|$|R
